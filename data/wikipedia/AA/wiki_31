Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC). The XXI Olympic Winter Games were held from February 14 2010 to February 28 2010. Many of the 2010 events were held in the nearby resort community called Whistler, about an hour's drive north of Vancouver.\nThe 2010 Winter Olympics is the third Olympics hosted by Canada, and the first by the province of British Columbia. Previously, Canada was home to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. The villages of Whistler and Garibaldi bid for the games in 1976 but failed to win.\nParticipating nations.\n82 National Olympic Committees had teams in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Cayman Islands, Colombia, Ghana, Montenegro, Pakistan, Peru and Serbia were in their first winter Olympics. Also Jamaica, Mexico and Morocco came back to the Games after missing the Turin Games. \nCosta Rica, Kenya, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Thailand, United States Virgin Islands and Venezuela did not join the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nSports.\nFifteen winter sports events were in the 2010 Winter Olympics. The eight sports grouped as ice sports were: bobsled, luge, skeleton, ice hockey, figure skating, speed skating, short track speed skating and curling. The three sports grouped as alpine skiing and snowboarding events were: alpine skiing, freestyle skiing and snowboarding. The four sports grouped as Nordic events were: biathlon, cross-country skiing, ski jumping and Nordic combined.\n\"Numbers in parentheses show the number of medal events for each sport.\"\nThe opening and closing ceremonies and the events grouped as ice sports (excluding bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held in Vancouver and Richmond. The sports grouped as \"Nordic events\" were held in the Callaghan Valley near Whistler. All alpine skiing events were held on Whistler Mountain (Creekside) and sliding events (bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held on Blackcomb Mountain. Cypress Mountain was the place for the freestyle skiing (aerials, moguls and ski cross), and all snowboard events (half-pipe, parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross).\nVancouver 2010 was the first winter Olympics that both men's and women's hockey were played on a narrower, NHL-sized ice rink, measuring 200\u00a0ft\u00a0\u00d7 85\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7 26\u00a0m), instead of the international size of 200\u00a0ft\u00a0\u00d7 98.5\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7 30\u00a0m). The games were played at General Motors Place, home of the NHL's Vancouver Canucks, which was temporarily renamed Canada Hockey Place for the time of the Olympics. This change saved $10\u00a0million in construction costs and allowed an additional 35,000 spectators to attend Olympic hockey games. However, some European countries felt this would give North American players an advantage since they grew up playing on the smaller NHL-sized rinks.\nMedal table.\nHere is the top of the medal table at the end of the games.\nMedal numbers shown in bold are the highest in their section.

This happens when sexual excitement damages prefrontal cortex of the offender and experience of dissociative-like symptoms that leaves the person to primitive reflexes. Evolutionary biologist Randy Thornhill and evolutionary anthropologist Craig Palmer theorize that the primary motive behind sexual assault is sex and signifies the inability of the perpetrator to deal with their own emotions for adaptive response.\nA study states \"successful inhibition of sexual expressions (restrain, cancel, suppress) is a natural and adaptive reaction to contextual factors against the excitatory expressions (initiate, execute, promote), and enables the regulation of sexual behavior, thereby preventing undesired consequences for the individual and for society.\" Another study states that increased sexual excitation and heightened desire are associated with poorly regulated sexuality, and also found that those with decreased response to humorous stimuli had good regulation.\nIn some cultures being sexually experienced is a required aspect of psychological maturity to achieve balance in desire, and a person lacking it is subjected to stigmatization. Popularity of online dating applications and their role in the hookup culture of certain societies are an example of it. Improper balancing between inhibitory and excitatory sexual mechanisms results in a maladaptive sexual response or deregulated sexuality and that further results into socially undesirable consequences.\nStatistics.\nAs many as 90-99% of people with developmental disabilities are sexually exploited before they are 18 years old.\nA 2010-2011 study in the United States of 1058 people aged 14 to 21 found that 8% had sexually assaulted in their lives. In 66% of cases no one found out and the perpetrator did not get into any trouble. 50% said that their victim was completely to blame. 2% had raped and 3% had tried to rape.\nTypes.\nIn some cases, one of the people involved may also be unable to consent to the contact. For example, they might be too young to consent or they may be unconscious. Rape is one form of sexual assault, but there are others.\nLaw.\nDifferent countries have different definitions of sexual assault. It is illegal, but often not reported. People convicted of sexual assault are sometimes sent to prison. In some places the crime of sexual assault has replaced the crime of rape. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, rape is a separate crime to sexual assault.\nReligion.\nSexual assault is a common theme in the bible, and often associated with condemn and punishment. In Judges 19:22-26, men of Gibeah assaulted an Ephraimite's wife to death and the whole of Israel went against the assaulter's. In Genesis 19:30-38, Lot, a nephew of Abraham, and a father figure of a family was raped by his daughters."}

It is very similar to an oboe, but as it is longer than an oboe it plays lower notes.\nThe lowest note of an oboe is B flat (just below Middle C). The lowest note of a cor anglais is an E natural, a diminished fifth (five notes of a scale, minus a semitone) lower than the oboe's lowest note.\nThe cor anglais is a transposing instrument pitched in F. This means that the music sounds a fifth lower than written. This has the advantage that the cor anglais player uses fingering as if he were playing an oboe, but it will sound a fifth lower. \nThe bell (the bit at the end of the instrument) is shaped like a pear. This gives it a less nasal sound (the sound of the cor anglais is less as if played through the nose). The reed is not fixed to a piece of cork like the oboe reed but it is put straight onto the short piece of metal (called a \"bocal\") at the top of the instrument.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"cor anglais\" is a French word which literally means \"English horn\", but the cor anglais is neither English nor a horn. No one is sure how it got its name, but many people think it is because the bocal at the top is curved (the French word for curved, \"angl\u00e9\" is pronounced like the word for English \"anglais\").\nRepertoire.\nMany oboists can play the cor anglais as well, just as flautists can play the piccolo (if they play both instruments in the same concert this is called doubling).\nThere are few solo pieces for the instrument, but mostly it is used for solo melodies in slow pieces for orchestra because it can sound very expressive.\nSome famous examples of cor anglais solos can be found in:"}

It was used in the past as a general anesthetic to make people unconscious during surgery. Now other chemicals are used because ether has side effects and can catch fire. Ether is used as a solvent by scientists for chemical reactions.\nPeople used to take ether as a recreational drug (drugs used for fun, such as alcohol) in the 1800s. People would either drink a drink with small amounts of ether in it, just like people drink alcoholic drinks, or inhale the fumes given off by pure or nearly pure ether. This could have addicted these people to the ether if they did that often enough. It was a big problem in some places, like Ireland and Poland. It first became popular because Europeans thought it was unladylike to drink alcohol. Women would drink ether instead, as would teetotalers, people who had decided not to drink alcohol. \nIt became illegal to sell ether in Poland in 1923.\nEther is made as a byproduct when ethanol is made, so it is not very expensive."}

Camp was a camp near Berlin, Germany, where British prisoners of war were detained (kept) during World War I. Ruhleben itself was then a village 10 kilometres to the west of Berlin, but now it is part of the city of Berlin, in a district called Ruhleben in the borough of Spandau. The camp was originally a horse racecourse.\nDetainees.\nThe detainees (people who were kept there) came from countries that were fighting against Germany in the war. Most of them were British. They were in Germany when the war broke out, which is why they were taken prisoner (detained). Some of them were in Germany because they lived there, others were on holiday at the time. Some of them were crew members of civilian ships that happened to be in German harbours at the time or who were captured at sea.\nThere were about 5,500 prisoners in the camp. Most of them spent all four years of World War I there. Books have been written about what it was like living in the camp. These include \"To Ruhleben - And Back\" by Geoffrey Pyke, who successfully escaped from the camp in 1915.\nThe detainees were mostly treated quite well. The guards had to obey the Geneva Conventions. Although there were some people who found it very difficult being kept there, many others found lots of things to do to keep themselves occupied. Letters, books, sports equipment and a printing press were all allowed into the camp and the detainees organised their own police force, magazine, library and postal service. Some of the detainees were young people who later became famous. They included the Canadian musician Ernest MacMillan who later became the conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. MacMillan had been on holiday in Germany to visit the Bayreuth Festival when war broke out. Charles Ellis and James Chadwick later became famous scientists. They used their time in Ruhleben to study. They were able to build a laboratory and do some experiments. There were famous footballers and athletes as well.\nThe Arts in Ruhleben.\nA lot of musical activities were organized in the camp. There was a Ruhleben Musical Society. Ernest MacMillan was a member and he gave concerts and lectures. Together with the composer and pianist Benjamin Dale, he played piano duet versions of all Beethoven\u2019s symphonies. The society put on a performance of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera \"Mikado\" and a pantomime version of \"Cinderella\". They did not have the music for the \"Mikado\", but someone had the libretto (the words), and four of the musicians wrote the music from what they could remember. They wrote it out for whatever instruments they had in the camp. There was also a Ruhleben Drama Society which put on productions of Shakespeare\u2019s \"Othello\" and \"Twelfth Night\" and Oscar Wilde\u2019s \"The Importance of Being Earnest\".\nSports at Ruhleben.\nAs well as music and drama, sports also played a big part in the life of the camp detainees. Among the detainees were four people who had been England internationals: Fred Spiksley, Fred Pentland, Samuel Wolstenholme and Steve Bloomer, a Scotland international, John Cameron, a German international Edwin Dutton, and John Brearley, once of Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. There was a Ruhleben Football Association. Sometimes 1,000 detainees watched a game. Cricket, rugby, tennis, golf and boxing were also popular.\nEnd of the war.\nThe detainees were free when the war ended and many of them were taken by ship back to Britain."}

From 1926 to 1942 he was principal of the \"Toronto Conservatory of Music\", later to become the Royal Conservatory of Music. He was the conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra between 1931 and 1956. He did a lot for music in Canada,and he was knighted in 1935 by King George V. In 1969 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He died in Toronto in 1973.\nWhen he conducted he often took the music very slowly. This gave him the nickname \"Lord Largo\" (\"Largo\" means \"slow and broad\" in music). He had an amazing musical memory and he could improvise very well. MacMillan helped to record and preserve the traditional songs and music of Canada's aboriginal or First Nations people. He had an important influence on almost every part of Canadian musical life."}

It is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System. Triton is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Triton has a complicated geological history, and it is thought to have a comparatively young surface compared to the age of the Solar System itself.\nIt was discovered by the British astronomer William Lassell on 10 October 1846, just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered by the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis d'Arrest.\nTriton is believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object, and is the coldest-known body in the Solar System. The surface temperature of Triton was recorded by Voyager 2 as -235\u00a0\u00b0C (-391\u00a0\u00b0F). Triton has its own magnetic field and has a faint trace of an atmosphere.\nOrbit.\nDrag and tidal interaction cause Triton to fall slowly into lowered orbits. This process is immensely slow. 3.6\u00a0billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. It will either collide with Neptune's atmosphere or break up, forming a ring system similar to that found around the planet Saturn.\nThe reason why Triton is thought to be a captured object is its orbit, which is unique in the Solar System. It is both retrograde (see diagram) and highly tilted. Although there are other satellites with retrograde orbits, they are much smaller than Triton, and much more distant from their host planets (their \"primaries\"). Triton, like our Moon, shows only one face to the planet: it rotates in synchrony to Neptune.\nSurface.\nAll we know about the surface of Triton comes from one fly-by of Voyager 2 in 1989. There are few impact craters. This suggests the surface is quite young in astronomical terms: estimates are six to 50 million years.\nDespite its very cold temperature, the surface of Triton is geologically active. There are events which look like geysers, volcanos and earthquakes. All the materials involved are quite different from those on Earth. Most of the gases are frozen most of the time. Gases like nitrogen are frozen until something occurs to melt them, then it turns back into a gas. A temperature increase of just 4 K () is enough to make this happen.\nPast formation and capture.\nLike most TNOs, Triton is mostly icy. While Triton's orbit does give us insight on its past, it is mostly unknown. It is speculated that Triton formed in a binary system, like Pluto, and was moving at extremely high speeds. However, when it passed through Neptune's Roche sphere the other body will have been flung out, reducing Triton's speed and allowing it to be captured. Currently, Triton is the most massive TNO to ever have existed, and its effects on Neptune's moon system were cataclysmic. All large moons were destroyed, flung out of orbit or crashed into Neptune itself."}

{"id": "70895", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70895", "title": "Teotihuac\u00e1n", "text": "Teotihuac\u00e1n was a city in pre-Columbian America. At the time it was most populated, it was the largest known city there at the time, housing over 100,000. This was from about the 1st century to about the 5th century. The city is about 40\u00a0km away from Mexico City.\nThe civilization and culture lived around this city is also called Teotihuac\u00e1n. Its important position can be seen in various sites in Veracruz, and the area controlled by the Maya civilization.\nName.\nThe name \"Teotihuac\u00e1n\" was given by the Nahuatl-speaking Aztec centuries after the fall of the city. Although the original name of the city is unknown, it can be seen in hieroglyph inscriptions. Nahuatl creation myths took place in the city. The Nauhatl name,Teotihuac\u00e1n, therefore translates to 'birthplace of the gods. '\nThe Maya seemed to have referred to it as \"puh\", as \"place of reeds\". This is similar to other Central Mexican settlements that took the name 'Tollan' such as Tula-Hidalgo and Cholula. It looks like \"Tollan\" was a general term, used for large settlements. In the concept of urbanism of the time, \"Tollan\" and other names seemed like a metaphor. They linked the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering of people in a city.\nHistory.\nSpeculation of Chronology.\nWe still only know very little about the beginning of Teotihuac\u00e1n. We also have not dedicated much time to such periods like the Formative Period. Some believe that this city was built by the Toltec people, but others believe that Tehuatican is much older than the Toltec Civilization.\nArcheologists Sugiyama and Sarabia also recently discovered older structures and Patlachique ceramics in the Sun Pyramid\u2019s fill. Studies from their radiocarbon assays demonstrated that the construction of the pyramid was later than what many had thought before. Many now think that the construction began at around 229-330 A.D. If the Patlachique and Tzacualli phases are now this late, the chronology of Teotihuac\u00e1n will require some crucial changes. No one has applied these changes yet to Teotihuac\u00e1n's chronology, but it it important that these findings be noted.\nChronology.\nWhat we do know about Teotihuac\u00e1n chronology is that beginning 150-100 B.C. Teotihuacan grew rapidly due to regional dominance with those of Cuicuilio and relocation of much of the population. Many settlements moved from the hinterlands to the valley floor. Teotihuac\u00e1n\u2019s urbanism grew exponentially during the subsequent Patalachique Phase. This is also where we see the Moon Pyramid being constructed, which is one of the earliest public structures in the city that still stands today. The following listed chronology is the development and decline of Teotihuac\u00e1n that is divided into six phases. This is based on ceramic distinctions defined through test excavations throughout the city.\nChronological Phase Approximate Dates\nPatlachique 100 \u2013 1 B.C.\nTzacualli A.D. 1-100\nMiccaotli A.D. 100-170\nTlamimilolpa A.D. 170-350\nXolalpan A.D. 350-550\nMetepec A.D. 550-650\nRapid population growth occurred within Teotihuac\u00e1n during the Tzacualli and Miccaotli phase. Many believe this is due to the relocation of settlements within the Basin of Mexico following volcanic activity, which impacted southern portions of the Basin. With this population being reorganized, vast amounts of construction efforts began to shape the ceremonial core of the city. Many have hypothesized that the Street of the Dead was established during this time, replacing earlier structures that now underlie this area, and large-scale construction occurred at the Sun Pyramid, the Moon Pyramid, and the Ciudadela complex.\nDuring the Tlamimilolpa period, the city of Teotihuac\u00e1n began to construct about 2,300 apartment compounds throughout the city. Teotihuacan\u2019s foreign interactions began to retract at around 450-500 A.D. Their level of economic and social power began to shrink by the Metepec Phase, as well as their population.\nCollapse.\nAt first, people believed that sometime in the 7th and th century, Teotihuac\u00e1n was attacked and burned by invaders The Toltecs might have invaded the city. More recent research shows, that the fire damage and looting seems to be limited to the structures and houses of the higher class or those considered elite. This evidence makes an uprising from the poor more likely than invasion. The invasion theory is also not as accurate, because excavation and restoration work started with the temples, and palaces. All these structures showed extreme fire damage. The archaeologists then concluded, that the whole city was most likely burned. The destruction seems to have been focused on structures along the Avenue of the Dead. Some statues seem to have been destroyed in a rather methodical way. The population in the city started to decline around the 6th century. This supports the hypothesis that there was unrest in the city. The decline in population is generally linked to drought and deforestation. These were linked to climate change, occurring in 535-536 A.D. There also seem to be more skeletons of young people, and more evidence of malnutrition in city in the 6th century.There is no conflict between the theories. Both increased warfare and internal unrest can also be effects of a general period of drought and famine.\nA major key that allowed Teotihuac\u00e1n to become so powerful and large was due to the absence of nearby enemies. However, due to sociopolitical chaos, environment issues that Tehuatican could recover from, and declining population, Teotihuac\u00e1n became very weak in regards to defending itself from the outside world. Other cities nearby tried to take the position of Teotihuac\u00e1n. These included Cholula, Xochicalco, and Cacaxtla. They tried to take advantage of Teotihuac\u00e1n of being weak. Some believe they may have aligned themselves against Teotihuac\u00e1n to reduce its influence and power. The art and architecture at these sites show an interest in emulating Teotihuac\u00e1n forms. There is also but also a broader mix of motifs and iconography from other parts of Mesoamerica, particularly the Maya region.\nTeotihuacan Culture.\nTeotihuac\u00e1n was a multi-ethnic city, with distinct Zapotec, Mixtec, Maya and what seem to be Nahua quarters. Immigration played a key role in the city\u2019s growth and its variety of ethnicity. This then included ethnic barrios. The well-known Oaxaca (Zapotec) Barrio and the Merchants\u2019 Barrio continue to be the subject of research on the immigrants in Teotihuac\u00e1n. Due to these barrios, we have found that there was immigrants coming from western Mexico, Oaxaca, the Gulf Lowlands, and central Mexico.\nThe city was a center of industry. Many potters, jewelers, and craftsmen lived there. Many obsidian artifacts were produced in Teotihuac\u00e1n. However, no ancient Teotihuacan non-ideographic texts are known to exist (or known to have existed). Mentions of the city in inscriptions from Maya cities show that Teotihuac\u00e1n nobility travelled to local rulers, as far away as Honduras. It might have conquered them. Maya inscriptions mention an individual nicknamed by scholars as \"Spearthrower Owl\". He seems to have been a ruler of Teotihuac\u00e1n, who reigned for over 60 years. He installed his relatives as rulers of Tikal and Uaxact\u00fanin Guatemala Most of what we infer about the culture at Teotihuac\u00e1n comes from the murals on the site and others, like the Wagner Murals, found in private collections, and from hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the Maya describing their encounters with Teotihuacan conquerors.\nReligon.\nThe religion of Teotihuac\u00e1n is similar to those of other Mesoamerican cultures. Many of the same gods were worshipped. This includes the Feathered Serpent and The Rain god. Teotihuac\u00e1n was know to be a major religious center. The priests most likely had a great deal of political power. As with other Mesoamerican cultures, the people of Teotihuac\u00e1n practiced human sacrifice. Human bodies and animal sacrifices have been found during excavations of the pyramids at Teotihuac\u00e1n. When the buildings were expanded, sacrifices were probably made to dedicate the new building. The victims could have been enemy warriors captured in battle. They were then brought to the city to be ritually sacrificed so the city could prosper. Some were decapitated, others had their hearts removed, still others were killed by being hit several times over the head. Some were even buried alive. Animals that were considered sacred and represented mythical powers and military might were also buried alive. They were imprisoned in cages, though. Cougars, a wolf, eagles, a falcon, an owl, and even venomous snakes were among those found.\nDiet.\nResearch on faunal and botanical remains from exploited apartment compounds found that there was a variety of resources for the city's diet. What was found included maize, amaranth, beans, squash, chili peppers, tomatoes, maguey, huahzontle, purslane, Mexican hawthorn, and Mexican cherries. A residue analysis from some ceramic vessels also demonstrated that a portion of Teotihuac\u00e1n's dietary input was pulque, which was fermented from the sap of the maguey cactus. Studies of faunal remains at various apartment compounds suggest that the primary animal species consumed included several species of rabbits, white-tailed deer, dog, waterbirds, fish, quail, turkey, dove, and turtle. Egg fragments from these animals such as quail and turkey were also found to be a primary use of protein. Due to the consumption of white-tailed deer, It is still argued whether or not the people of Tehuatican hunted more or relied on domestic animals.\nSite layout.\nThe city's broad central avenue, called \"Avenue of the Dead,\" is flanked by impressive ceremonial architecture, including the immense Pyramid of the Sun (second largest in the New World after the Great Pyramid of Cholula) and the Pyramid of the Moon. Along the Avenue of the Dead are many smaller talud-tablero platforms. The Aztecs believed they were tombs, inspiring the name of the avenue. Now they are known to be ceremonial platforms that were topped with temples. Further down the Avenue of the Dead is the area known as the Citadel, containing the ruined Temple of the Feathered Serpent. This area was a large plaza surrounded by temples that formed the religious and political center of the city. The name \"Citadel\" was given to it by the Spanish, who believed it was a fort.\nOne aspect that was unique to Teotihuac\u00e1n's layout was their utilization of apartment compounds. Over time, there were over 2,000 apartment compounds throughout city. These compounds didn't just house one family, but housed multiple families. These housed various people in all aspects of social classes as well. However, these people were not sent to live in certain compounds at random. Teotihuac\u00e1n had a housing system which ensured that people and their families who had the same occupation would also live with other families with that same oppcupation. Rabbit breeders lived with rabbit breeders and plasters lived with plasters. However, it was also very common for people to do multiple specializations. Many did lots of farm work or specialized in some other sort of craft specialty. These compounds provided a standardized residential form but varied on the inside and expressed status, class, occupational, and ethnic differences between families. In every compound, each family had its own suite of rooms for cooking, dining, storing their belongings, and sleeping. They also had areas for directing funerals and burying their dead. Patios were centers of household religious dedication focused on patron or domestic deities.\nPyramids and Burials.\nThe Moon Pyramid was the first of the three major pyramids to be built. It was constructed in several stages that had a fourth enlargement during the third century A.D. Four burial complexes were found with sacrificial victims and some wealthy objects, but none seemed to be anything important like a ruler or someone high in the religious or political realm.\nThe Sun Pyramid is near an artificial cave and is associated with the Storm God, time, astronomy, the sun, and the Pleiades. This pyramid was mostly dedicated to investments and pilgrimage. Due to the pyramid\u2019s semi-detached platform, it was known as the area of New Fire ceremonies. The New Fire ceremonies only happened at the end of a 52-year cycle at the time where new houses, temples, and cities were founded, and new rulers came into power.\nThe Feathered Serpent Pyramid was the last large temple added to the Street of the Dead. This pyramid is linked to the creation of a watery world with sacred warfare, sacrifice, authority, and rulership. Dedication of this temple included offerings of sacrificed warriors and some have theorized that other people who were sacrificed were captives. A central tomb was found, but had been looted in prior times. Many consider this tomb to be for someone that was a ruler or for someone of high importance.\nArchaeological site.\nKnowledge of the great ruins of Teotihuac\u00e1n was never lost. After the fall of the city, various squatters lived on the site. During Aztec times, the city was a place of pilgrimage and identified with the myth of Tollan, the place where the sun was created. Teotihuac\u00e1n astonished the Spanish \"conquistadores\" during the post-conquest era. Today Teotihuac\u00e1n is one of the most noted archaeological attractions in Mexico.\nExcavations and investigations.\nMinor archaeological excavations were conducted in the 19th century, and in 1905 major projects of excavation and restoration began under archaeologist Leopoldo Batres. The Pyramid of the Sun was restored to celebrate the centennial of Mexican Independence in 1910. Major programs of excavation and restoration were carried out in 1960-65 and 1980-82. Recent projects at the Pyramid of the Moon and the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent have greatly expanded evidence of cultural practices. Teotihuac\u00e1n features museums and reconstructed structures."}

It is a republic because the chief of State is a president, and not a king, queen or emperor. It is presidential because the president is also the head of government and there is not a prime minister as in other countries. It is democratic because the president, vice-president and the members of Congress are elected by the people.\nNational government.\nThe Constitution also says that there are three branches of government with separation of powers. They are the \"executive branch\", the \"legislative branch\", and the \"judicial branch\". The three branches are independent from each other.\nExecutive branch.\nThe executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law. The people elects a President (and a Vice-President) who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the Armed Forces. The President decides whether or not the bills that the Legislative branch passes will become laws. He may also make \"decrees\" to govern the country and to name persons in different positions. The President is in charge of many departments that control all of the different parts of the government. These departments are called Secretaries of State because they help the President to govern the country. For example, the Secretary of State of Agriculture takes care of the agriculture of the country. The President may serve two 4-year terms, making 8 years in all.\nLegislative branch.\nThe legislative branch is the part of the government that makes laws. The legislative branch is made up of Congress, which is located in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. The Congress is divided into two groups or \"chambers\".\nOne group is the Chamber of Deputies (\"C\u00e1mara de Diputados\"). The Chamber of Deputies is made up of Deputies, who are each elected by voters from their own province. The number of Deputies a province has is based on how many people live there: the more people a province has, the more deputies it gets. No province can have less than two Deputies. Deputies serve 4-year terms. The total number of Deputies for the period 2006-2010 is 178.\nThe other house is the Senate (\"Senado\"). In the Senate, each province is represented equally, by one Senator. Senators serve 4-year terms. There are 32 Senators, one for every province and one for the National District, where the capital city is.\nJudicial branch.\nThe judicial branch is the part of government makes sure that the laws are obeyed and interprets what the law means. The judicial branch is made up of the Supreme Court and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution, then it is not a law anymore. The Supreme Court is made up of at least 11 judges. The head of the Supreme Court is called the President of the Supreme Court. A Supreme Court Justice serves until he or she either dies, or resigns (quits in the middle of his or her term). The Supreme Court controls all the courts in the country.\nProvincial and municipal government.\nThere is a governor in every province; there is not a governor in the National District, where is the capital of the country. The governors are only representatives of the President of the Republic.\nEvery province is divided into two or more municipalities (Spanish: \"municipios\", singular \"municipio\"); the Distrito Nacional has only one municipality - Santo Domingo.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are only two branches in the municipalities: the executive and the legislative. They are elected for four years by the people that lives in the municipality.\nThe Mayor (\"S\u00edndico\") is the head of the executive branch and the Municipal Council (\"Ayuntamiento\") is the legislative branch.\nThe rural parts of a municipality are divided into \"Secciones\" (singular, \"Secci\u00f3n\"; in English, \"section\"); every \"Secci\u00f3n\" has a person which represents the municipal administration.\nThe Dominican Republic has 154 municipalities (\"municipios\") (June 20 2006).\nMunicipal districts.\nA municipality can have one municipal district (\"distrito municipal\") or more. A municipal council (\"Junta Municipal\") for such a municipal district is elected by the municipal council of the municipality to which it belongs and not for the people that lives there.\nThere are 202 municipal districts (\"distrito municipal\") in the Dominican Republic (June 20 2006)."}

When Eastern Europe was communist-controlled there were no professional cyclists, so until the early 1990s, the race was for amateurs only, and the winners mostly came from Poland.\nAlthough the Tour de Pologne had not reached a high status, and was little known, the International Cycling Union (UCI) decided to make it a part of the UCI ProTour from 2005, which means that the major cycling teams compete in the race."}

They came from the Caribbean coast of South America. Around 1200 CE, they moved northward to the island chain of the Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles.\nWhen Christopher Columbus came to the Americas, the Ta\u00ednos were living in the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico), and some islands of the northern Lesser Antilles. Their culture was different from the culture of the Arawak people (another indigenous group of South America). They were the first people that the Spanish met in the Americas.\nName.\nThe name Ta\u00edno was given by Columbus. When he met some native men, they said \"Ta\u00edno, Ta\u00edno\", meaning \"We are good, noble\". Columbus thought that ta\u00edno was the name of the people.\nRouse divides the Ta\u00ednos into three main groups. One is the Classic Ta\u00edno, from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. Another is the Western Ta\u00edno or sub-Ta\u00edno, from Jamaica, Cuba (except for the western tip of the island) and the Bahamas. The third is the Eastern Ta\u00edno, from the Virgin Islands to Montserrat.\nThe Ta\u00ednos of the Bahamas were known as the '\"Lucayan\". (At that time, the Bahamas were called the \"Lucayas\"). Lucayos were Ta\u00ednos, but their culture was less developed. Archeologists call them \"sub-Ta\u00ednos\".\nOrigins.\nThe Ta\u00ednos' ancestors went from the center of the Amazon Basin to the Orinoco Valley. From there, they went through Guyana and Venezuela and got to the Caribbean islands.\nA different theory says that the Ta\u00ednos' ancestors came from the Colombian Andes.\nThe Ta\u00edno culture developed in the Greater Antilles.\nCulture and lifestyle.\nTa\u00edno society was divided into two classes. There were the \"naborias\" (common people) and the \"nita\u00ednos\" (nobles). Both classes were governed by chiefs known as \"caciques\". The caciques could be either male or female. There were also \"bohiques\" (medicine men).\nThe Ta\u00ednos lived in villages called \"yucayeques\". . The villages in the Bahamas were the smallest. The Ta\u00ednos built large round houses called caney, where several families lived. The cacique and his family lived in a rectangular house called bohio. People slept on cotton hammocks (\"hamacas\").\nThe Ta\u00ednos often played a ball game called \"batos\". \"Batey\" was also the name of the place where they played and had dances. The cacique sat on a chair of wood called \"duho\", or \"dujo\"."}

The main proto-Armenian (Aryan) god was Ar, the god of Sun, Fire and Revival. The Armenian hypothesis of Indo-European origins connects the name with the \"Ar-\" Armenian root meaning light, sun, fire found in Arev (Sun), Arpi (Light of heaven), Ararich (God or Creator), Ararat (place of Arar), Aryan, Arta etc. According to the researchers, the name of Ardini religious center of ancient Urartu also related to the god Ar-Arda. The cult of Ar appear in Armenian Highland during 5-3th millennium BC and had common Indo-European recognition: Ares (Greek), Ahuramazd (Persian) Ertag (German), Ram (Indian), Yar-Yarilo (Slavonic) etc. After adoption of Christianity the cult of Ar was also evident in Armenia, remembered in the national myth, poetry, art and architecture."}

Lupin is a character in the \"Harry Potter\" book series written by J. K. Rowling. In the Harry Potter movies, he is played by actor David Thewlis. \nRemus John Lupin was an only son of Lyall and Hope Lupin (n\u00e9e Howell). At the age of 4, he was bitten by the foul werewolf Fenrir Greyback when his father-Lyall Lupin- insulted all werewolves. Fenrir tried to kill him but Remus got saved by his father. However he became a fully fledged werewolf. His parents were both upset by this, because it meant he could not go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, when Albus Dumbledore became headmaster, he let Lupin go to Hogwarts. He had a tunnel built so that Lupin could sneak out of the school during the times when he became a werewolf. This tunnel had the Whomping Willow (a violent tree that attacks those who get near it) built over it, so nobody could get to him by mistake. The tunnel led to the Shrieking Shack, a building in the wizarding village of Hogsmeade, said to be the most haunted of them all. When Lupin was in the Shrieking Shack as a werewolf, he had no humans to bite, so he often bit himself. These bites led to cries of pain that led the villagers to believe that the building was haunted.\nDuring his time at Hogwarts, he became good friends with three other boys his age: James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. These four came to be known as the Marauders, infamous for their mischievous antics. They knew Hogwarts and the grounds like the back of their hands, and actually created a magical map that showed the location of everyone on the grounds and in the castle. The map also revealed the many secret passages hidden in the school. His friends knew of his lycanthropy, but did not seem to mind. They simply referred to it as his \"furry little problem\". Later on, they even became Animagi (a person that can turn into an animal) so that they could accompany him on the full moon and make his transformations more fun.\nOn the 31st of October, 1981, Remus lost all of his friends at once, through betrayal, jail and death. \nHe was a wizard during Voldemort's first and second rises to power. He was member of the First and Second Order of the Phoenix \nRemus was having trouble getting a job as there was an anti-werewolf litigation so he had no money and therefore could not buy wolfsbane potion (a potion created by Damocles Belby which lets a werewolf keep his mind during a full moon), so he locked himself up in rooms every full moon so that he didn't hurt anyone. Albus Dumbledore knew of his struggles and found Remus living in a semi-derelict cottage in Yorkshire. Dumbledore offered Remus a job for the Defence Against The Dark Arts post at Hogwarts and Lupin immediately accepted. He resigned at the end of the year when Severus Snape let it slip to students that he was a werewolf.\nHe was killed along with his wife Nymphadora Tonks in the Final Battle for Hogwarts. Their son, Edward Remus Lupin survived, who was left in the care of Tonks' mother, Andromeda Tonks, and his godfather, Harry Potter. "}

It is a human but also a wolf, and most people fear them because of how they look. There are characteristics that make werewolves special, and that allow a person to tell them apart from real wolves, such as the eyes, shape, and tail. When in human form, werewolves look and act like any normal human being, although they usually appear to be ill around nights when there is a full moon. When in wolf form, the werewolf does keep the mind of human but will only attack those who anger it or take a member of its pack. Depending on the fiction or legend, a werewolf can be killed by a silver bullet. However, a werewolf cannot be killed by crosses or holy water, like vampires in similar legends. When a werewolf dies, it turns back into a human.\nThe name is derived from \"wer\" meaning man and \"wulf\" meaning wolf. They are sometimes referred to as 'Lycans'.\nSome of the earliest myths of werewolves are those of Greek and Romania roots. Ovid in the Metamorphoses, told of King Lycaeon, who was visited by gods. Skeptical of them being true gods he decided to test them by serving human flesh in their banquet of honor. Cannibalism is frowned upon in many parts of the world, past or present (especially in that particular area). When the gods discovered the tainted meal they changed King Lycaeon into a Werewolf. Since he obviously liked human flesh, the wolven form would be more acceptable for when he took part in his little \"activity.\"The word Lycanthropy originates from Greek roots (Lykoi meaning wolf and anthropos meaning man)\nBecoming a werewolf.\nSeveral ways for becoming a werewolf have been told about. Most are dangerous and scary for anyone to do. In other cases, the body is rubbed with a magic ointment. Drinking rainwater out of the footprint of the animal was reported to work.\nIn Italy, France and Germany, it was said that a man or woman could turn into a werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.\nIt is said that humans can be turned into werewolves by having been bitten by another werewolf. Getting scratched is a questionable way of becoming a werewolf, but most don't believe in it. However, both of these only work if the werewolf in question is in wolf form.\nHowever, as depicted from the Harry Potter series lycanthropy is rarely inherited from parent to child. For example, Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin, Remus being the werewolf and Tonks a half blood, had a child named Teddy Lupin who inherited no signs of lycranthropy but he did inherit his mother's \nMetamorphmagi.

The event took place on August 19, 1989.\nThe event.\nThe event was planned to be a peaceful demonstration. Both countries agreed to open a gate in the border fence, between Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland (near Eisenstadt), and Sopronk\u0151hida (Steinambr\u00fcckl) on the Hungarian side of the border.\nThe leaders of the time were Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian minister, Imre Pozsgay. The person who did the actual cutting of the border fence was the general secretary of the International Paneuropean Union, Walburga Habsburg Douglas. The gate was to be symbolically opened for three hours.\nMore than 600 citizens of the German Democratic Republic took the chance to cross into the west once the Iron Curtain was opened. They had been told about the event by its organizers. At that time, the Hungarian border police still had orders to shoot anyone trying to cross the border illegally. However, they acted carefully and did not shoot at the fleeing people, this time.\nThe number of people who actually crossed the border to enter the west was only a few hundred on that first day. On the following days, the border was watched more closely, due to orders by the Hungarian government. Therefore, a smaller number of people managed to flee then. Hungary opened its borders to citizens of East Germany on 11 September 1989.\nRemembering the event.\nToday, the Paneuropean Picnic is seen as one of the important events that led to the end of the German Democratic Republic and the Cold War, the fall of the Iron Curtain, and the unification of the two German states. \nThe event is celebrated every year on 19 August on the spot where the border was opened.\nToday, artwork made by Hungarian artists is at the place where the fence was cut. It shows a partly opened door.\nIn 1996, a 10 meter statue was built in Fert\u0151r\u00e1kos near Sopron. It was made by Gabriela von Habsburg. It shows a piece of barbed wire.

By the end of the PPV, all four members of Evolution held every male championship on \"RAW\".\nBatista and Flair held the titles until February 16 2004 when they were defeated by Booker T and Rob Van Dam. They later won the titles back for a short period.\n2005.\nAs 2005 began, Triple H believed that Batista was becoming a threat to his World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H told Batista not enter the Royal Rumble. He said it would be selfish of him to do so, and that he should be helping Triple H keep the title. Dave entered anyway and went on to win the \"Royal Rumble\". This earned him the right to wrestle in the main event of WrestleMania 21 against the World Champion of his choice.\nIn an attempt to get Batista to challenge WWE Champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield rather than him, Triple H created a plan to have Batista run over in a limousine similar the one used by Layfield. At first, Batista did not want help from Evolution in dealing with JBL. Triple H said that Evolution needed to stick together and went with him anyway. Triple H saved him from the vehicle before he got hit. Batista found out about the plan while listening Evolution members when they did not know he was there. He signed a contract for a match with World Champion Triple H at WrestleMania 21. Batista went on to win the World Heavyweight Championship on April 3 2005 at WrestleMania 21.\nOn June 30 2005 Batista was moved back to SmackDown! JBL and Batista wrestled for the championship at the Great American Bash on July 24 2005. JBL defeated Batista by disqualification after the referee saw Batista use a steel chair. They wrestled at SummerSlam on August 21 2005 in a No-Holds-Barred match. Batista pinned JBL to win the championship title.\nWWE.com reported that Batista suffered a muscle tear in his back at the taping for the November 11 2005 edition of \"SmackDown!\". Plans had been made for Batista to defend the title in a match with Eddie Guerrero and Randy Orton on November 18 2005. The match did not take place because of the death of Eddie Guerrero on November 13 2005.\n2006.\nOn January 9 2006, WWE.com announced that Batista tore his right triceps following a match with Mark Henry at a live event on January 8, 2006. The following day, WWE.com announced that, due to his injury, Batista was forced to give up the World Heavyweight Championship at the \"SmackDown!\" taping on January 10 2006 (aired on January 13 2006). Batista had surgery on his arm on January 12, 2006.\nBatista made his return on July 7, 2006. Batista won his first televised match since his return, a six man tag match with Rey Mysterio and Lashley taking on King Booker, Finlay and Mark Henry. Oddly, Mark Henry was injured, and could not wrestle in the match between the two at The Great American Bash. Batista made several tries to win back the championship title before finally winning it back from Booker T on November 26, 2006.\n2007.\nTwo months later at WrestleMania 23, Batista lost the championship to the winner of the Royal Rumble match, The Undertaker. They continued to fight over the title to a tie in a match at Backlash 2007. After a Steel Cage Match between the two men on May 11, Edge won the title from the Undertaker by using his Money in the Bank title opportunity. Afterwards, Batista challenged Edge three times but never won the championship. The third match included the statement that if Batista lost, he could no longer get another chance at the World Heavyweight Championship while Edge remains champion.\nEdge later was injured and gave up the belt just before he was to wrestle Kane at the 2007 Great American Bash pay-per-view. The Great Khali became the new World Heavyweight Champion, winning a Battle Royal and eliminating Batista. Batista and Kane faced Khali at The Great American Bash where Khali retained the title. Batista finally defeated Khali, and Rey Mysterio, Jr., at WWE Unforgiven to claim his third World Heavyweight Championship after eight consecutive tries. Batista is the second man to pin The Great Khali, the first being John Cena.\n2010.\nBatista then became involved in WWE Chairman\u00a0Vince McMahon\u00a0and\u00a0Bret Hart's rivalry in February 2010 by assisting McMahon in attacking Hart; John Cena attempted to save Hart, but would end up being assaulted by Batista.\u00a0On February 21 at\u00a0Elimination Chamber, as payment for Batista attacking Hart, McMahon allowed Batista to face Cena for the WWE Championship right after Cena won the title in an\u00a0Elimination Chamber\u00a0match. Batista would win the match and his second WWE Championship, which resulted in Batista moving back to Raw. On March 28 at\u00a0WrestleMania XXVI\u00a0Batista lost the WWE Championship to John Cena in a rematch, ending his reign at 35 days.\u00a0Batista received his rematch for the title in a\u00a0Last Man Standing\u00a0on April 25 at\u00a0Extreme Rules, but was defeated by Cena after Cena duct-taped his legs around a ring post, preventing him from standing up. Batista and Cena faced off once again for the WWE Championship on May 23 at\u00a0Over the Limit, but failed again to regain the title from Cena in an\u00a0\"I Quit\" match.\u00a0The following night on\u00a0\"Raw\", Batista opened the show in a wheelchair and claimed he would be pursuing legal action against Cena and the WWE for his injuries (which he revealed in 2014 to be a legitimate compression fracture of his L1 spine). His promo was interrupted by new\u00a0\"Raw\"\u00a0General Manager Bret Hart, who requested he face an injured Randy Orton to qualify for a shot at WWE Championship against Cena again at the new\u00a0Fatal 4-Way\u00a0pay-per-view. Batista refused and quit the company after Hart named Orton winner by forfeit. His profile was subsequently moved to the WWE.com alumni page. He later said in an interview that he left WWE because he did not like the direction the company was going in and would not be returning any time soon.\nReturn to WWE (2014).\nOn the 23 December 2013 episode of\u00a0\"Raw\", a vignette aired announcing the return of Batista on the 20 January 2014 episode of\u00a0\"Raw\". It was later announced that Batista would be participating in the\u00a02014 Royal Rumble Match.\u00a0Batista returned to confront\u00a0WWE World Heavyweight Champion\u00a0Randy Orton on the January 20\u00a0\"Raw\", and vowed to win Royal Rumble Match and become champion at WrestleMania. Later that night, Batista confronted\u00a0Alberto Del Rio, who had been trash talking him for several weeks, and eventually attacked him with a\u00a0\"Batista Bomb\".\u00a0Six days later at the\u00a0Royal Rumble, Batista entered the Rumble match at number 28 and eliminated Roman Reigns\u00a0to win the match, becoming the fifth wrestler to win multiple Rumble matches.\u00a0The live crowd reacted negatively towards Batista, cheering Reigns (a villainous character for the past year) and\u00a0Daniel Bryan\u00a0(who was not in the match). The crowd continued to boo Batista after Reigns was eliminated.\u00a0After the show went off the air, Batista mocked Bryan and gestured his\u00a0middle finger\u00a0at the crowd.\u00a0On the February 3\u00a0\"Raw\", Batista was confronted and was ultimately assaulted by Del Rio before chasing him off.\u00a0Batista retaliated the following week, powerbombing Del Rio through the announce table.\u00a0At the\u00a0Elimination Chamber\u00a0event and on the following\u00a0\"Raw\", he was heavily booed by the fans during matches against Del Rio.\u00a0Batista won the match at Elimination Chamber, but continued to suffer a torrid fan reaction with 'Boo-tista' chants.\u00a0Batista responded to the audience on the February 28\u00a0\"SmackDown\", saying he didn't come back to be liked and promising to be the next WWE World Heavyweight Champion, thus reverting to being a villain once again and mocking other superstars stating they were not \"real men\".\u00a0\u00a0Bryan was added to the WrestleMania main event after defeating Triple H in the opening match of the show. Bryan would ultimately win the triple threat match at WrestleMania XXX, forcing Batista to tap out and winning the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the process.\nThe next night on\u00a0\"Raw\", Batista and Orton teamed together to face\u00a0The Usos\u00a0for the\u00a0WWE Tag Team Championships, but the match ended in a no contest due to both teams being counted out.\u00a0Later that night, Batista and Orton, along with\u00a0Kane, attacked Bryan before he was set to defend his title against Triple H. Before Triple H could defeat Bryan,\u00a0The Shield\u00a0interrupted by spearing Triple H and taking out Batista, Orton and Kane, causing Bryan to retain his title via disqualification.\u00a0On the April 14 edition of\u00a0\"Raw\", Batista, Triple H and Randy Orton came down to the ring to attack The Shield after their 11-on-3 handicap match, using the name and the theme of\u00a0Evolution.\u00a0At\u00a0Extreme Rules, Evolution lost to The Shield. At\u00a0Payback, Evolution lost to The Shield again. On June 2 edition of\u00a0\"Raw\", Batista (kayfabe) quit WWE after Triple H denied him a shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship; this was done to write Batista off WWE TV so he could promote\u00a0\"Guardians of the Galaxy\".\nRetirement and Legends program (2014-2020).\nIn December 2014, Batista announced he was retiring from professional wrestling. In January 2015, WWE announced Batista had signed a Legends contract.\nThird Return to WWE (2018).\nOn October 16, 2018, Batista again united with the rest of Evolution. This was for an appearance on SmackDown's 1000th episode.\nReturn and Appearances (2014-present).\nHe signed a 5 year contract and was to return at the Royal Rumble 2020 but he got injured and he is to return in 2021. Batista is coming out of retirement.\nChampionships and accomplishments.\nSteroid allegations.\nIn August 2007, Batista was said to have used anabolic steroid after an ESPN article released the names of wrestlers that bought medication from Signature Pharmacy of Orlando. Batista denied this and was said to be very mad because of the report. He denied ever being a cutomer of Signature, and stated that he has been \"tested regularly by the WWE, and I am in full compliance with the WWE Wellness Program.\" The WWE punished ten wrestlers named in the issue, though Batista was not one of them.\nDeparture from World Wrestling Entertainment and MMA debut.\nBatista quit WWE on May 24, 2010. He went to MMA on June 16, 2010. He won a fight against Vince Lucero."}

Until cell division, a parent cell divides to form two or more new daughter cells.\nCell populations.\nCell populations go through a type of exponential growth called doubling. Thus, each generation of cells should be twice as numerous as the previous generation. But not all cells survive in each generation, as written by Richard Dawkins in 1997.\nCell reproduction.\nCell reproduction is asexual.\nThe process of cell reproduction has three major parts. The first part of cell reproduction involves the replication of the parental cell's DNA. The second major part is the separation of the duplicated DNA into two equally sized groups of chromosomes. The third major aspect of cell reproduction is the physical division of entire cells, usually called cytokinesis.\nCell reproduction is more complex in eukaryotes than in other organisms. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, a process that includes DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Eukaryotic cell reproduction either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two \"nuclear division\" processes. \nComparison of the three types of cell reproduction.\nThe DNA content of a cell is duplicated at the start of the cell reproduction process. Prior to DNA replication, the DNA content of a cell can be represented as the amount Z (the cell has Z chromosomes). After the DNA replication process, the amount of DNA in the cell is 2Z (multiplication: 2 x Z = 2Z). During Binary fission and mitosis the duplicated DNA content of the reproducing parental cell is separated into two equal halves that are destined to end up in the two daughter cells. The final part of the cell reproduction process is cell division, when daughter cells physically split apart from a parental cell. During meiosis, there are two cell division steps that together produce the four daughter cells.\nImmediately after DNA replication a human cell will have 46 \"double chromosomes\". In each double chromosome there are two copies of that chromosome's DNA molecule. During mitosis the double chromosomes are split to produce 92 \"single chromosomes\", half of which go into each daughter cell. During meiosis, there are two chromosome separation steps which assure that each of the four daughter cells gets one copy of each of the 23 types of chromosome.\nSexual reproduction.\nCell reproduction that uses mitosis can reproduce eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes bother with the more complicated process of meiosis because sexual reproduction such as meiosis confers a selective advantage."}

Both strands serve as templates for the reproduction of the opposite strand. The process is sometimes called \"semi-conservative replication\" because the new DNA from the original strand contains half of the original and half of the newly synthesized DNA.\nThis process occurs in all life forms with DNA. There are some differences in the control of DNA replication in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.\nIn a cell, DNA replication begins at specific places in the genome, called \"origins\". As the DNA unwinds at the origin, the synthesis of new strands forms at a \"replication fork\". In addition to DNA polymerase, other enzymes at the fork help to start and continue the DNA synthesis.\nDNA polymerase.\nDNA polymerases are a family of enzymes that carry out all forms of DNA replication. However, a DNA polymerase can only extend an existing DNA strand paired with a template strand; it cannot begin the synthesis of a new strand. To begin synthesis, a short fragment of DNA or RNA, called a 'primer', is created and paired with the template DNA strand.\nIn general, DNA polymerases are extremely accurate, making less than one mistake for every 107 (10 million) nucleotides added. Even so, some DNA polymerases also have 'proofreading' ability: they can remove nucleotides from the end of a strand in order to correct mismatched bases.\nDNA repair.\nDNA in cells is constantly being damaged. The nucleus of cells contains a number of repair mechanisms which fix almost all of this damage. \"A large set of DNA repair enzymes continuously scan the DNA and repair any damaged nucleotides\"."}

He went to Harrow School where he was very good at all subjects as well as sport. In 1913 he become a cadet in the Royal Military Academy. He wanted to join the Royal Engineers. \nHe was on holiday in Germany the next summer when World War I broke out. All British people who were in Germany were sent to the Ruhleben P.O.W. Camp just outside Berlin. The place where the detainees (prisoners of war) were held had been a horse racecourse. There were lots of stables, and in each stable there were 27 horse boxes which became the detainees' home during the war. The detainees were allowed to do lots of things to keep themselves busy. They could get books, and Ellis made good use of his time to study. Another detainee in the camp was the scientist James Chadwick. Chadwick taught Ellis a lot and together they made a laboratory in one of the horse stables where they made scientific experiments on the photochemical process.\nCareer after the war.\nAfter the war Ellis decided to study at Trinity College, Cambridge.

He went to Manchester High School, and studied at the Universities of Manchester and Cambridge.\nIn 1913, Chadwick went to Berlin in Germany to work with the scientist Hans Geiger. He also worked with Ernest Rutherford. He was still in Germany when World War I broke out and he was interned in Ruhleben P.O.W. Camp just outside Berlin. In the camp, which had more than 5,000 detainees (prisoners of war) had been a horse racetrack. There were stables, each with 27 horse boxes. The detainees lived in these boxes. The detainees were allowed to do things to keep themselves busy. Chadwick worked with a young scientist called Charles Ellis. Together they set up a laboratory in the stables where they worked on the ionisation of phosphorus and also on the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine.\nCareer.\nResearch at Cambridge.\nAfter the war, Chadwick returned to Cambridge where he worked with Ernest Rutherford, studying the emission of gamma rays from radioactive materials. They also studied the transmutation of elements by bombarding them with alpha particles, and investigated the nature of the atomic nucleus.\nIn 1932 Chadwick made a very important discovery: he discovered the particle in the nucleus of an atom that became known as the neutron because it has no electric charge. In contrast with the helium nuclei (alpha particles) which are positively charged, and therefore repelled by the strong electrical forces in the nuclei of heavy atoms, this new tool in atomic disintegration need not overcome any electric barrier and is capable of penetrating and splitting the nuclei of even the heaviest elements. In this way, Chadwick prepared the way towards the fission of uranium 235 and towards the creation of the atomic bomb. For this important discovery he was awarded the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society in 1932, and later the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1935. He was also nicknamed \"Jimmy Neutron\" because of his discovery of the neutron.\nLiverpool.\nChadwick became professor of physics at Liverpool University in 1935. He worked on the possibility of an atomic bomb. Later he realized that the nuclear bomb really was going to be made. He found it very frightening that the science he had been working on could lead to such a terrible weapon.

These people were supporters of civil rights for African-Americans in the Southern USA. They soon developed their own music scene in neighborhoods in New York City (Greenwich Village) and San Francisco (Haight-Ashbury). They were also strongly against the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, and what they called the \"Establishment\" (this was a word for mainstream society). They were also against the \"military-industrial complex\". This phrase was taken from a warning in the farewell speech of President Dwight Eisenhower in 1961.\nMany more people began to see hippies in the news after the Human Be-In (January 1967) and the 1967 \"Summer of Love\" were held in San Francisco. By this time, they had developed their own lifestyle that included psychedelic styles, drug use, usually some amount of travel, and much longer hair than other people. These styles quickly spread across the country, especially to college campuses where students were protesting President Lyndon Johnson's policies in Vietnam, the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, and other events. They also spread to the UK, Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, among other places. \nIn 1968 many more Americans turned against the war following the Tet Offensive, King was shot, and politicians began to get ready for the election for President in November. Many colleges were shut down by students, and people burned their draft cards at public rallies. A group of radical hippies called the Yippies, led by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, led a huge protest during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, where they tried to run a pig called Pigasus as a candidate for President. The mayor responded by sending in riot police who beat people up in front of news cameras. The riot police even beat the cameramen, reporters, and other innocent people. This was shown on the news, and many programs and television stations began to feel more sympathetic to the hippies for a while. This made hippie lifestyle much more mainstream through the early seventies. \nIn 1969, Richard Nixon succeeded Johnson as President, and protests continued \u2014 not just against the war, but against the court trials and hearings of the Yippie leaders who became known as \"the Chicago Seven\" (originally \"Chicago Eight\"). Also in that year, a huge rock concert was held in Bethel, New York \u2014 the three day Woodstock Festival. At this festival, 500,000 hippies and music fans heard some of the most famous singers and groups of the time. The people there also did things like nude swimming, mud-sliding, rain-dancing and mass tribal chants. They did this to show their freedom to the world. \nLate that year, a murderer named Charles Manson who posed as a hippie killed several people. Because some people blamed hippies for this, the term began to fall a little out of fashion in 1970, even if the fashions themselves did not. A new type of hard rock called heavy metal was developing out of one style of hippie music. A band called Led Zeppelin took the number one spot for most popular band of the year in 1970, which had been held by the Beatles for eight years. Also that year, when students at Kent State University in Ohio were protesting Nixon's spread of bombing to Laos, the National Guard shot at them, and four were killed. This had a chilling effect on the hippies and the whole country, but the peace movement continued. In 1973, the draft was ended, and the war ended soon after that. US public attention turned to the Watergate scandal. After this, hippies never again had the attention they once did, though the lifestyle continued, especially in other countries. In the mid-seventies, trends like punks and disco were also spreading, causing the hippie image to fade in the media."}

Added to brandy, the hard climb up Mont Ventoux, the hot conditions, and a stomach complaint, the doping was fatal.\nEarly life.\nSimpson was the youngest of the six children. He was born in Easington, County Durham. After World War II, the Simpson family moved to Harworth in north Nottinghamshire, another mining village, where Simpson grew up and became interested in cycling. He attended the village school and later Worksop Technical College and in 1954 was an apprentice draughtsman at an engineering company in Retford.\nAs a cyclist he joined first Harworth and District Cycling Club and later Rotherham's Scala Wheelers, and by his late teens was winning local time trials. He was then advised to try track cycling, and he travelled regularly to Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester to compete. He won medals in the national 4000m individual pursuit discipline. \nWhen he was 19, Simpson was part of the Great Britain team pursuit squad which won a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Two years later, he won a silver medal in the individual pursuit at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff.\nIn April 1959, Simpson went to France to live in the Breton fishing port of Saint-Brieuc. He hoped to win enough local amateur races to get noticed by a professional cycling team. It was in Saint-Brieuc that he met Helen Sherburn. They married on 3 January 1960).\nProfessional cyclist.\nWithin two months, Simpson had won five races and in July 1959 was offered terms by two professional teams; he decided to join the Rapha Geminiani team, which already had a British cyclist, Brian Robinson, in its squad. His first event as a professional was a small stage race, the Tour de l'Ouest (Tour of the West). He won two stages and finished 18th overall - a major achievement for a new pro who would normally be expected to be a \"domestique\" to the team's leader.\nHe competed in the 1959 World Championships in the Netherlands in the individual pursuit and professional road race, finishing fourth in both events. Simpson turned down an invitation to ride in the 1959 Tour de France, because he thought he was not ready. He rode in the 1960 Tour, and finished 29th, and was third in stage 3. \nIn 1960 he also competed in his first Classic races: he had top ten finishes in La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne and Paris-Roubaix - he led the Paris-Roubaix for around 40\u00a0km before running out of energy and being overtaken less than 10k from the finish, ending up 9th.\nIn April 1961, however, Simpson won his first Classic . He won the tough Ronde van Vlaanderen after a two-man sprint at the finish. That year he also finished 5th in the \"Race to the Sun\"\u00a0-\u00a0the Paris-Nice stage race, and 9th in the world championship, but he abandoned the Tour de France on stage 3, because of an earlier knee injury.\nIn 1962, he became the first Briton to wear the \"maillot jaune\" (the jersey of the leader of the Tour de France) and eventually finished 6th overall. That was highest final placing by a Briton until Robert Millar was fourth in 1984). Simpson had been third until a crash. \nEarlier in the season, he again showed how much he likied for the tough Belgian Classic races. Simpson finished 5th in the Ronde van Vlaanderen and 6th in the Gent-Wevelgem.\n1963 and 1965 were probably Simpson's best years for Classic races. He was riding for the Peugeot BP team in 1963, when he won the gruelling motor-paced event Bordeaux-Paris, was second in Paris-Brussels and Paris-Tours, third in the Ronde van Vlaanderen, 8th in Paris-Roubaix, and 10th in both La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne and Giro di Lombardia.\nIn 1965, Simpson became the first Briton to be world professional road racing champion.\nIn 1967 he won the early season Paris-Nice stage race (taking two second places and a third place on different days) and the Tour of Sardinia. He also rode in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a for the first time, collecting two stage victories en route to an eventual 33rd place overall.\nThursday 13 July 1967.\nAt the start of the 1967 Tour de France, Simpson thought that he could do well in the event. After the first week he was sixth overall, but a stomach bug began to affect his form, and he lost vital time in a stage including the Col du Galibier. In Marseille, at the start of stage 13 on 13 July, he was still suffering the bad stomach as the race headed into Provence on a blisteringly hot day.\nOn the day's main climb, Mont Ventoux, Simpson broke away early, but was soon passed by the eventual stage winner, Julio Jim\u00e9nez, and four others. About two kilometres from the summit, Simpson began to zig-zag across the road, eventually falling against an embankment. While his team car helpers wanted him to retire from the race, Simpson insisted on carrying on. He went another 500m or so before again beginning to fall; he toppled unconscious into the arms of his helpers. Despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and the administration of oxygen, plus a helicopter airlift to a nearby hospital, Simpson died. Two tubes of amphetamines and more empty tubes were found in the rear pocket of his racing jersey. He died of heart failure caused by dehydration and heat exhaustion, with drugs a contributing factor.\nOn the next day, the other riders did not want to race so soon after Simpson's death and asked the organisers for a postponement. In the end, they agreed to ride but with the condition that they would allow a British rider to win the stage. This honour went to Barry Hoban. Hoban later married Simpson's widow.\nMemorials.\nBritish cyclists paid for a granite memorial to Simpson near the spot where he died. \nHarry Hall, the team mechanic, said that Simpson's last words were \"Go on, go on!\". The words \"Put me back on my bike!\" were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, a journalist writing about the Tour for \"The Sun\". Saltmarsh was not present at Simpson's death.\nSimpson is buried in Harworth cemetery. A small museum about him was opened in August 2001 by former Tour de France rider Lucien van Impe in the Harworth social club. A small version of the Mont Ventoux Simpson Memorial was put outside that club in 1997, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Simpson's death.\nAchievements: a summary.\nSimpson's professional achievements include four Classic one-day victories:\nIn addition to these victories, Simpson frequently finished in the top ten of Classics, and won numerous criteriums and other events.\nAs an amateur he also won an Olympic Games team pursuit bronze medal (1956), silver in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games individual pursuit, silver (1956) and gold (1958) medals in the British 4000m individual pursuit championship, and was British League of Racing Cyclists hill climb champion in 1957, picking up a silver medal in the same event the following year."}

An electron cloud model is different from the older Bohr atomic model by Niels Bohr. Bohr talked about electrons orbiting the nucleus. Explaining the behavior of these electron \"orbits\" was a key issue in the development of quantum mechanics.\nThe electron cloud model says that we cannot know exactly where an electron is at any given time, but the electrons are more likely to be in specific areas. These areas are specified by orbitals. The orbitals are specified by shells and sub-orbitals. In the Bohr model, electrons are assigned to different shells. The shells, k,l,m,n,o,p,q, each represent different levels of energy, and are also called energy levels. The sub-orbitals; s,p,d,f, are regions where it will be more likely to find electrons, and can each hold a different number of electrons. the s,p,d,f orbitals are all shaped differently. This can be proven by the repeating patterns of chemical properties in the periodic table. Using quantum mechanics, chemists can use the electron cloud model to assign electrons to different atomic orbitals. Atomic orbitals also explain the patterns in the periodic table. \nThe electron cloud model was developed in 1926 by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Werner Heisenberg. The model is a way to help visualize the most probable position of electrons in an atom. The electron cloud model is currently the accepted model of an atom. The atoms were traveling at such a high speed that there was no predictable time or place for the electron to be. The electrons were like a blur which is where they got the 'Electron Cloud' from.\nAccording to Bohr's calculations for a hydrogen atom, the electron under normal conditions always stays at a certain distance from the nucleus. This distance is called the Bohr radius and is approximately 0.529 \u00c5 (). But according to the wave mechanical or cloud concept model, the electron keeps on moving away or towards the nucleus and the maximum probability of locating it lies at a distance of 0.529 \u00c5 from the nucleus. In other words, the radius of the electron cloud or the radius of maximum probability is 0.529 \u00c5."}

That book was first published in 1936 in German, translated into English. The English edition was 1945.\nReich wrote in the book what he saw as wrong, namely the double standard regarding morals in the society of his time. These double standards and the suppression of the sex drive would make people different. This would lead to a buildup of aggressions and frustration. Freeing the sex drive would lead to a peaceful change of society, according to Reich.\nReich dies in prison 1957, but his ideas had their effect in the 1960s when people changed their views about sex. They were more open-minded about it. The publications of people like Alfred Kinsey helped give wings to the movement.\nFirst wave of sexual emancipation.\nThe sexual revolution was prepared by a \"first wave\" of pioneers who campaigned against the sexual repression which was common in the 19th century. This change began, roughly, at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century. One impetus came from the pioneers of birth control and family planning. The books and publicity of Marie Stopes in England and Margaret Sanger in the United States, changed the lives of many women.\nAttitudes towards homosexuality and masturbation were altered by the publications of Havelock Ellis. Ellis was the first person to say in print that masturbation was normal, and did not cause any medical problems. The ideas of Sigmund Freud were also influential. He believed that people's strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life."}

In different languages, his name is written:\nHe was born on February 2, 1457 at Arona, near Anghiera (called now Angera) on Lake Maggiore, Lombardy, Italy. He went to Rome in 1477, at the age of twenty, and there he met important persons of the Catholic Church. In 1486, Anghiera met the Spanish ambassador in Rome, and with him to Spain in August, 1487, to the court of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella of Castile.\nHe wrote in Latin the first accounts of explorations in the Americas in a series of letters and reports that were published from 1511 to 1530 in chapters called \"Decades\". The first three \"Decades\", together with a description of his experiences in Egypt, were published in 1516 under the title: \"De orbe novo decades cum Legatione Babylonica\" or, for short, \"De orbe novo\" (\"On the New World\").\nHe was the first writer to use the word \"Hispaniola\" to name the island that Columbus named \"La Espa\u00f1ola\".

In the 1920s he was a pupil of Sigmund Freud in Vienna and made important contributions to psychoanalysis (\"Charakteranalyse\" 1933; engl. 1945ff). His work was rediscovered by the activists of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.\nDuring the 1920s Reich became involved in the social struggles of the time. In 1927 he joined the Communist Party. There he founded \"SexPol\", short for Sexual Politics. In 1933 he was kicked off from the Party, and in 1934 from the organisations of Psychoanalysis. At this time he started his own research on the biological foundations of psychoanalysis, later on called \"orgonomy\". Orgonomy was to be the science of orgone, a \"primordial energy\" Reich claimed to have discovered. \nThe other side of Reich's story is that he was blamed to have invented a pseudoscience method for treating cancer. He was exposed as a fraud in 1947 articles by journalist Mildred Edie Brady, published in the magazines \"Harper's\" and \"The New Republic\", the latter titled \"The Strange Case of Wilhelm Reich,\" with the subhead, \"The man who blames both neuroses and cancer on unsatisfactory sexual activities has been repudiated by only one scientific journal\". The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided that they were dealing with a \"fraud of the first magnitude\". \nFinally, in 1956 Reich violated an injunction got by the FDA, and was arrested. All his research equipment including his books was destroyed. He was sentenced to two years prison. Reich died on 3 November 1957 (aged 60) in the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Opinions about him remain very divided.\nReich had founded \"Orgonon\" in Rangeley, Maine after immigrating to the US. It was his home, laboratory and research center, and also Reich's burial place. It is now open to the public as the Wilhelm Reich Museum."}

Saint-\u00c9tienne, 12 May 1842; died Paris, 13 August 1912) was a French composer. He is most famous for his operas, although he wrote a large amount of other music as well.\nHis life.\nEarly years.\nJules\u2019 father had a business making agricultural tools. His mother gave him his first piano lessons. In 1847 his father retired and the family moved to Paris. When he was ten years old he went to the Paris Conservatoire for piano and solf\u00e8ge studies. Over a period of ten years he studied there, gaining many prizes. He was taught composition by Ambroise Thomas who was an excellent music teacher.\nJules earned enough money to keep himself by giving piano lessons. He also played timpani in the orchestra of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique. This helped him to get a good knowledge of French composers such as Gounod (especially his \"Faust\") as well as music by Gluck, Mozart and Beethoven. He was also very keen on the music of Berlioz and Wagner.\nIn 1863 he won the Prix de Rome (it was his second attempt). This allowed him to spend two years in Italy. During this time he travelled a lot but hardly composed anything.\nEarly career.\nIn 1866 he returned to Paris where he married. He gave piano lessons. At this stage he had hardly written anything important. However, soon he was to start writing many famous works. He became friends with other composers: Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Bizet, Delibes, Lalo, Faur\u00e9, Duparc and others. Several of these people competed in writing operas for competitions. Massenet wrote several works, but he found writing operas difficult. His operas never won any prizes.\nYears of fame.\nIn 1870 he served in the National Guard during the Franco-Prussian war. After the war he continued to compose, and he became professor of composition at the Conservatoire. He spent many years working on an opera \"Le Roi de Lahore\". This was a great success and helped him to become internationally famous. For many years he spent the winter in Paris and the summer in various places in the country where he could compose. His pupils at the Conservatoire included Piern\u00e9, Koechlin, Hahn, Enesco. In 1884 his opera \"Manon\" was produced at the Op\u00e9ra-comique. This made him clearly the most famous opera composer of his time. It was an op\u00e9ra-comique with some speech over the music. During the next 28 years he composed another 20 operas. Another opera that was particularly famous was \"Werther\". It was first performed in 1892 in Vienna and a year later in Paris. It was soon being performed in all the big European opera houses.\nSome of his greatest operatic roles were written for the young American soprano Sybil Sanderson. This includes the main role in his popular opera \"Tha\u00efs\". The story is set in Egypt and is about a monk who tries to persuade Tha\u00efs to give up her life as a prostitute. However, he soon finds he is falling in love with her himself. This mixture of religion and salvation became an extremely popular subject for operas at that time. The \"M\u00e9ditation\" from \"Tha\u00efs\" is a short piece for violin solo. It is one of the best-loved of all Romantic violin solos.\nHe continued to compose lots of music even when his health was failing during his last years. He was a quiet, family man who hated it when people made a fuss about him. He liked best to spend his evenings quietly at home, or in the countryside during the summer. He continued to compose in a Romantic style to the end of his life, even though many composers around him (e.g. Debussy) were writing music which was more \u201cmodern\u201d sounding."}

It became popular and was played on college radio stations and made people know who U2 were. \"I Will Follow\" was thought of as a Christian song. This was because most of the members of U2 were Christians. None of the band members has said that that is true. This album is somewhat about Bono's life as a child, and his mother's death when he was 14.\nAt first, the producer of band Joy Division, Martin Hannett, was supposed to produce (help record) the album, but he was sad about the suicide of Ian Curtis, so he did not help record the album. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite, and recorded in a Dublin studio called Windmill Lane Studios. Some songs were written in the studio, like \"An Cat Dubh\" and \"The Ocean\". Some other songs had already been written, and U2 were performing them often, like the songs \"Stories for Boys\", Out of Control\", and \"Twilight\". The Edge, U2's guitarist, recorded all of the songs using his Gibson Explorer guitar and his Fender Stratocaster guitar.\n\"Boy\" reached #63 on the Billboard album charts, a list of the most popular albums in the U.S., and was not on the popularity charts in the United Kingdom. The song \"I Will Follow\" reached #20 on a popularity chart called the Mainstream rock charts. People said that their live shows were too predictable and that Bono, the singer, used too much echo in his singing, but their playing showed that they could play very well. People also said that Bono was a \"charismatic and passionate\" singer, meaning that he sang very emotionally and that people could connect to him. \"Boy\" is the only U2 album that every song has been played live, including all of the b-sides (songs that are extra songs on a single). On the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, made by the rock magazine Rolling Stone, \"Boy\" was 417th on the list.\nAlbum cover.\nThe boy on the cover of the album is a boy named Peter Rowen. He is the brother of Bono's friend Guggi, and he is a famous Irish photographer. He has been on other U2 album covers, including \"Three\" and \"War\". The person who took the picture has made other U2 covers, too. In case that the band could be blamed for pedophilia, they changed the cover to a stretched picture of the four band members.\nTrack listing.\nAll of the songs were written by U2, and all of the lyrics were written by Bono.\nThere were two singles released from this album. They were \"I Will Follow\" and \"A Day Without Me\". The album that came before \"Boy\" was called \"Three\". On very early copies of \"Boy\", there is a 30-second instrumental piece that is am early version of \"Fire\", which was on a later album called \"October\"."}

It is characterised by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success, or until the agent stops trying. It is an unsystematic method, which does not employ insight, theory or organised methodology.\nAccording to W.H. Thorpe, the term was devised by C. Lloyd Morgan after trying out similar phrases \"trial and failure\" and \"trial and practice\". Under Morgan's canon, animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial and error learning. An example is the skilful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.\nEdward Thorndike showed how to manage a trial and error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the law of effect in learning. He plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning."}

The first book that could be called an atlas was constructed from the calculations of Claudius Ptolemy, a geographer who worked in Alexandria circa A.D. 150. The first edition was published in Bologna in 1477 and was illustrated with a set of 27 maps, though scholars say that it is not known whether the printed maps were engraved versions of original maps made by Ptolemy, or whether they were constructed by medieval Greek scholars from Ptolemy's text.\nFrom about 1544, many maps were produced, especially in the important trading centers of Rome and Venice. Each publisher worked independently. They produced maps based upon their own needs. The maps often varied dramatically in size. Over time, it became common to bind the maps together into one book. Although the term atlas was not in use in 1544, these works are now called \"IATO\" atlases - (Italian, Assembled to Order) or more frequently \"Lafreri atlases\" after one of the leading publishers of the period. \nModern atlases.\nWith the coming of the global market, publishers in different countries can reprint maps from plates made elsewhere. This means that the place names on the maps often use the designations or abbreviations of the language of the country in which the feature is located, to serve the widest market. For example, islands near Russia have the abbreviation \"O.\" for \"ostrov\", not \"I.\" for \"island\". This practise differs from what is standard for any given language.\nSelected general atlases.\nSome cartographically or commercially important atlases include the following:\nSee Other websites below for online modern atlases and digitized historical atlases.

The team takes part in many editions of the annual Grand Tours of cycling, such as the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia. Since 2005, the team has been one of 20 teams that compete in the new UCI ProTour.\nIn December 2007 T-Mobile decided to pull out of cycling sponsorship, and end their sponsorship immediately although they had promised to carry on until 2010.\nThe team was founded in 1991 as Team Telekom, sponsored by T-Mobile's parent Deutsche Telekom - but in 2004 their name changed to the current Team T-Mobile . It has 29 riders, 9 physiotherapists or nurses, 9 mechanics, and has 22 partners. The team is managed of Olaf Ludwig and Eddy Vandenhecke, and its sports directors, sometimes caleed \"directeurs sportifs\" Brian Holm, Tristan Hoffman, , Valerio Piva and Jan Schaffrath.\nHistory.\nTeam Telekom.\nFounded as \"Team Telekom\" in 1991 with Walter Godefroot the team manager, the team soon became important presence in international cycling. In 1994, the German sprinter Erik Zabel won the first UCI Road World Cup victory in the history of the team, the Paris-Tours. A year later, in 1995, Zabel won two stages in the 1995 Tour de France.\nThe next two years saw the international breakthrough of the team. Godefroot brought in Danish rider Bjarne Riis, finished third in the 1995 Tour, and he went on to win the 1996 Tour de France. Jan Ullrich was then a support rider, and finished in second place. In the 1997 Tour de France Ullrich as he won the race with support from Riis, who had earlier won the Amstel Gold World Cup race . Team Telekom also won the team classification, as the overall strongest team of the 1997 Tour.\nIn both 1997 and 1998, Zabel won the Milan-Sanremo, while Ullrich finished second in the 1998 Tour de France. Ullrich went on to win the 1999 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, but missed the 1999 Tour de France due to a knee injury. The next year, Zabel won the overall World Cup victory, having won the Milan-Sanremo and Amstel Gold Race, while Ullrich placed second again in the 2000 Tour de France to Lance Armstrong. In 2001, Zabel won Milan-Sanremo for the fourth time. Ullrich came in second in the 2001 Tour de France, while Zabel won six stages combined in the 2001 Tour and Vuelta. Kazakh rider Alexandre Vinokourov won the Paris-Nice stage race in 2002, a feat he would duplicate in 2003, also winning the Amstel Gold Race and Tour de Suisse that year. As Ullrich left the team to form Team Bianchi in 2003, Vinokourov became team leader for the 2003 Tour de France. He finished in third place, just below the second placed Ullrich. Zabel won the 2003 Paris-Tours, while Italian rider Daniele Nardello took the Z\u00fcri-Metzgete.\nT-Mobile.\nIn 2004, the team changed its name to T-Mobile. Jan Ullrich returned to the team, and raced the 2004 Tour de France as team leader, but Vinokourov did not ride in the Tour. Ullrich finished fourth, while Andreas Kl\u00f6den was the best placed rider of the team in second place. Team T-Mobile was again the strongest team overall. In the spring of 2005, Vinokourov won the Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge classic race. Ullrich, as the team leader, finished 3rd overall in the 2005 Tour de France. Alexandre Vinokourov rode in support, and finished fifth as well as winning two stages, including the final stage on the Champs-Elysees. Italian rider Giuseppe Guerini also won a stage and the team once again winning the team classification.\nIn July 2005, during the 2005 Tour, Vinokourov's contract was running out and speculation was abundant if he was to stay with T-Mobile. With four days left of the 2005 Tour, he announcedt that he would leave the team to try to win the Tour de France as a team captain and after the Tour he joined the Liberty Seguros team. After 13 years with Team Telekom and T-Mobile Team, Erik Zabel also left in 2005 to ride for the newly formed Team Milram. Before the 2006 season, Olaf Ludwig took over from Walter Godefroot as team manager.\nDoping scandal.\nThirteen riders were expelled from the 2006 Tour de France because of a Spanish doping scandal. The day before the prologue of the 93rd edition Jan Ullrich, one of the favourites to win the race, was among those excluded from the Tour. Another T-Mobile rider, Oscar Sevilla, was also expelled, leaving the team starting with only seven riders.\nOn 9 July, the team sacked sporting director Rudy Pevenage because he was linked with Jan Ullrich in the doping scandal. \"The contract linking T-Mobile to Pevenage has been retrospectively stopped on 30 June,\" the team's general manager, Olaf Ludwig, said.\nOn July 21, 2006, Jan Ullrich was fired. investigation.\nAt the 2006 Tour de France, T-Mobile won the team classification for the third consecutive year, Andreas Kl\u00f6den reached the podium (3rd place) for the second time, Matthias Kessler won Stage 3, Serhiy Honchar won two individual time trials (Stages 7 and 19) and wore the yellow jersey for 3 days (after Stages 7\u20139).\nIn May 2007, several former riders admitted using banned substances (include EPO) while riding for the team in the mid 1990s, including Erik Zabel, Rolf Aldag, Brian Holm, Bjarne Riis, Bert Dietz, Udo B\u00f6lts and Christian Henn including the seasons in which Riis and Ullrich won the Tour de France. Team doctors Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich has also confessed to helping and administering banned substances. Heinrich was Team Telekom's sporting director until May 3, 2007 when he was suspended following allegations published in former team member Jef d'Hont's book.\nTo present a new image the team brought a young team to the 2007 Tour de France, and drug-free attitude and image. However, Patrik Sinkewitz tested positive for higher than normal level of testosterone during a training camp. The results were only announced when Sinkiewitz was in hospital because of a crash. He was still dismissed on 31 July 2007.\n2007 ProTeam.\nAs of July 19, 2007\nFilm: Hell on Wheels.\nIn 2005 a film titled \"Hell on Wheels\" was released.

The probability distribution of a random variable formula_1 is often written as formula_2 (or simply formula_3). Such a distribution can either be discrete, taking a discrete (or countable) amount of values, or continuous, taking an uncountable amount of values (as from a continuous interval).\nAs an example, the probability distribution for a single roll of a normal 6-sided dice can be presented by:\nwhere result is the outcome of the dice roll, and the probability shows the chances of that result occurring.

It is in the northeastern part of the country. It takes up the whole Saman\u00e1 Peninsula. Its capital city is Santa B\u00e1rbara de Saman\u00e1, usually called just \"Saman\u00e1\". It is one of the main tourist regions of the country with several important resorts.\nName.\nThe word \"Saman\u00e1\", written as \"Xaman\u00e1\" centuries ago, is the Ta\u00edno name of the region. The meaning of the word is unknown.\nHistory.\nSaman\u00e1 was visited by Christopher Columbus in January 1493, during his first travel to the Americas. At that moment, Saman\u00e1 was occupied by \"Ciguayos\", a tribe of Native Americans with the same culture of the Ta\u00ednos but a different language. They were the first Indians that fought against the Europeans.\nAfter the conquest of the Hispaniola island by the Spaniards, Saman\u00e1 was occupied by different groups of Europeans, mainly French people. Some groups of \"\" (runaway slaves) lived in the mountains for many years.\nTo fight against those European groups, Spain brought galleys (a galley was a narrow war ship where prisoners and slaves were used to move the ship), and founded in 1756 the town of Santa B\u00e1rbara de Saman\u00e1 on the northern coast of Saman\u00e1 Bay, with people from the Canary Islands.\nWhen the eastern part of the Hispaniola (the \"Santo Domingo\" colony) was given to France in 1795, the French government tried to develop the region, and many French families moved to Saman\u00e1 to grow coffee; many places in Saman\u00e1 have French names. Most of those French families left Saman\u00e1 when Spain took again the colony in 1809.\nDuring the Haitian Occupation (1822 - 1844), a fort was built in Los Cacaos (west of Santa B\u00e1rbara de Saman\u00e1) to control the Saman\u00e1 Bay; another small fort was built in El Lim\u00f3n, on the northern coast.\nJean-Pierre Boyer, President of Haiti, sent some Haitian families to live in Tess\u00f3n, to the north of Santa B\u00e1rbara de Saman\u00e1. Boyer brought ex-slaves from Philadelphia to live in the country, and 200 of them were taken to live in Saman\u00e1. Both the Haitian and the American populations kept their languages and traditions.\nAfter the Independence, several Dominican governments tried to sell or rent the Saman\u00e1 Bay, with the peninsula, to several foreign governments but without any result.\nIn 1888, the railway from S\u00e1nchez to La Vega (in the La Vega province) began to run across the rich region of the Cibao. S\u00e1nchez became the most important port of the country during the rest of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. The railroad worked until 1966.\nIt was created as a Maritime District (a special administrative category that has been abandoned) on 4 June 1867. The 1907 Dominican Constitution changed its status to province with the municipalities of Saman\u00e1 and S\u00e1nchez. In 1966, Las Terrenas was made the third municipality of the province.\nEl Lim\u00f3n became a municipal district in 2001, Arroyo Barril in 2003 and Las Galeras in 2005.\nLocation.\nTo the north and east of the peninsula (and province) is the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. To the south is the Saman\u00e1 Bay. Saman\u00e1 shares borders with the Duarte and Mar\u00eda Trinidad S\u00e1nchez provinces (west). It also shares a short border with the Monte Plata province.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Saman\u00e1 province, and 44,190 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km\u00b2.\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 22nd (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province.\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 108,238 inhabitants.\nThe largest city of the province is Saman\u00e1, its head municipality or capital, with an urban population (in ) of 13,857 inhabitants.\nMore than 95% of the population is black.\nGeography.\nA mountain chain called \"Sierra de Saman\u00e1\" runs across the province, from west to east; only in the western part, west of S\u00e1nchez, there is flat land because it is an estuary. The Sierra de Saman\u00e1 gets to the coast, except in some places where there are very good beaches. The highest mountain in the province is in the eastern part of the peninsula and is called \"La Meseta\", high.\nThe altitude of Santa B\u00e1rbara de Saman\u00e1, provincial capital, is above sea level.\nRivers.\nThere are many rivers and creeks but all are very short because the mountains get very close to the coast. There are more rivers on the southern part of the province but the most important rivers (\"Lim\u00f3n\", \"Cant\u00f3n\" and \"San Juan\") are on the northern part, flowing to the Atlantic Ocean;\nIn the southwestern part of the province is the \"Yuna\" river, one of the most important river of the country; it flows into the Saman\u00e1 Bay.\nClimate.\nSaman\u00e1 has a wet tropical climate, with temperature of , on average. The yearly rainfall on the Sierra de Saman\u00e1 is above .\nMunicipalities.\nThere are 3 municipalities and 3 municipal districts (M.D.) in the province.\nEconomy.\nThe most important economic activity of the province is agriculture; Saman\u00e1 is the biggest producer of coconut in the country but the demand for that product is diminishing. Cacao and rice are produced in the western part of the province.\nEven if fishing was a very important activity, its importance has been reduced because the Yuna River has been filling the Saman\u00e1 Bay with solid material.\nTourism is very important in the province because of the beautiful beaches in the province. Whale-watching is an important economic activity because many tourists come the province to watch the humpback whales that come in late winter and early spring to breed in the warm waters of the Saman\u00e1 Bay."}

{"id": "71578", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71578", "title": "Natural selection", "text": "Natural selection is a central concept of evolution. It was proposed independently by the English biologists Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the middle of the 19th century (1858). It is sometimes called the \"survival of the fittest\". Darwin chose the name as an analogy with artificial selection (selective breeding).\nNatural selection is the process where organisms with favorable traits are more likely to reproduce. In doing so, they pass on these traits to the next generation. Over time this process allows organisms to adapt to their environment. This is because the frequency of genes for favourable traits increases in the population.\nMembers of a species are not all alike, partly because of differences in heredity (genetics). This is true even with children of the same parents. Some of these differences might make one organism better at surviving and reproducing than others in a particular habitat. When this organism reproduces, its offspring may get the genes which gave it the advantage. Some adaptations are extremely long-lasting, useful in many habitats.\nThe process.\n\"Natural selection\" explains why living organisms change over time to have the anatomy, the functions and behaviour that they have. It works like this:\nExamples.\nThere are now quite a number of examples of natural selection in natural populations.\nAntibiotic resistance.\nA well-known example of natural selection in action is the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. Natural populations of bacteria contain, among their vast numbers of individual members, considerable variation in their genetic material, as the result of mutations. When exposed to antibiotics, most bacteria die quickly, but some have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible. If the exposure to antibiotics is short, these individuals will survive the treatment. The elimination of individuals which have no resistance is an example of natural selection.\nGiven enough time, and repeated exposure to the antibiotic, a population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge. This leads to what is known as an evolutionary arms race, or co-evolution, in which bacteria continue to develop strains that are less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers continue to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new strains of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects, and with malarial resistance to quinine.\nCamouflage.\nOne famous case study is the study of peppered moth evolution, and there are many other examples. Most of these day-flying moths were light in colour, but just a few of the moths were dark. At first, the light coloured moths survived better because they were camouflaged against the light colour of the nearby trees. This made it hard for birds to see them.\nWhen factories were built, the pollution made all the trees look black. Now the light coloured moths were obvious against the dark bark. The dark coloured moths had the advantage after the environment changed. The genes controlling dark colour spread through the population of moths. After the second world war, controls against pollution worked to make the environment cleaner. Then the lighter moths once again had the advantage, and are now much more common.\nMimicry is another example: Some harmless insects mimic other insects which are dangerous, or which taste foul. Mimicry evolves because \"the better mimics survive better\". They live to produce more offspring than the less good mimics. The genes of the better mimics become more common in the species. Over time, mimic species get closer to their models.\nSexual selection.\nSexual selection is a special kind of natural selection. It is a theory of Charles Darwin that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by competition \"within\" a species. Darwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the \"struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex\". It is usually males who fight each other. Traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics (including horns, antlers, etc.) and sometimes referred to as 'weapons'. Traits selected by mate choice are called 'ornaments'.\nFemales often prefer to mate with males with external ornaments\u2014exaggerated features of morphology. Genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolism\u2014features that also benefit females. This idea is known as the 'good genes' hypothesis. Sexual selection is still being researched and discussed today.\nErnst Mayr said:"}

Many people also use it simply as a fun word for \"violin\". Someone who plays the fiddle is a \"fiddler\". The bow is sometimes called a \"fiddling stick\". Fiddle playing, or fiddling, is a style of folk music.\nThe word \"fiddle\" is also used for instruments of several hundred years ago which developed into the violin. These instruments varied a lot from one country to another and one time to another. They were of different shapes and sizes, and even had many different names. Often they were held against the chest instead of being tucked under the chin. In the Middle Ages a small, narrow violin called a kit was often used by dancing masters. It was small enough to be put in a pocket. In south eastern Europe there was even a fiddle with a belly (the front of the instrument) made of skin. Fiddle strings were usually made of gut.\nMany fiddles have bridges which are flatter on top than those of classical violins. The flatter bridges makes it easier to play chords and to bow quickly from one string to another. The strings are tuned in a variety of ways. A player might even change the tuning for playing different pieces of music. Tunings other than the regular G-D-A-E tuning, such as G-D-G-D or A-E-A-E, are common. One, two or three of the strings may have been used for a drone (continuous note) while playing the tune on the top string(s).\nMany fiddlers have not received classical training but have learned by listening to other fiddlers and copying them. The music they play is dance music. Classical violin playing developed out of country fiddle playing. Most fiddlers use bows which are the same as violin bows, but in some countries such as Hungary they use shorter, heavier bows with horse hair that is tied around the frog (the heel of the bow). With this type of bow the player tightens the hair by squeezing it while playing.\nFiddles were played by people from all areas of society: from noble people to simple peasants. Many of them were minstrels who entertained important people. Some of them may have been able to read music, but many would have learned by copying other players and memorizing the music. At important feasts the minstrels may have played music while walking up to the high table when the food was brought in. They played to accompany dancers and singers, and even acrobats. We can see from old paintings that they sometimes played with other instruments such as trumpets, drums or percussion. We do not know the music they played because it was never written down, but some tunes we still hear today may have come from those old tunes, since some people still learn tunes by ear, from people who learned them by ear, and so on. Some American \"old-time\" tunes, and some Breton tunes may have come to us in this way, for example. "}

It is similar to the violin, but it has eight or nine strings and the wood is thinner. Four of the strings are strung and played like a violin, while the other strings are sympathetic strings (they vibrate when the others are played). \nThe Hardingfele is used for dancing. The player stamps his foot loudly while playing. It was the Norwegian tradition for a bridal procession to be led to the church by a Hardanger fiddler.\nThe instrument has a lot of decoration, with a carved animal (usually the Lion of Norway) or a carved woman's head as part of the scroll at the top of the pegbox, mother of pearl in the tailpiece and fingerboard, and black ink decorations called 'rosing' on the body of the instrument. Sometimes pieces of bone are used to decorate the pegs and the edges of the instrument.\nThe earliest known instrument is dated 1651 although we do not know whether this date is correct. By 1850 it had developed into the Hardanger fiddle known today. \nThe Hardanger fiddle can be tuned in lot of different ways, depending on the music to be played. The Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg liked Norwegian folk music. When he wrote the famous tune \u201cMorning\u201d for the music for \"Peer Gynt\" he was thinking of the notes that would be played on the Hardanger fiddle.\nIn the 20th century the Hardanger fiddle has become very popular in Norway through competitions. The players have to play in the style of the area they come from."}

Rodin was born in Paris. He made solid objects from stone or clay. His most famous works are 'The Thinker' and 'The Kiss'.\nAlthough Rodin is generally considered the start of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. His training was old-school. He took a craftsman-like approach to his work, but he was rejected three times to Paris's foremost school of art.\nRodin had a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with the sculpture tradition, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic.\nRodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory. He modelled the human body with realism, with individual character and physicality. Rodin refused to change his style. Gradually there came increasing favour from the government and the artistic community.\nHis statue of writer Honor\u00e9 de Balzac for the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens des Lettres\" was heavily criticised. Rather than try to convince skeptics of its merit, Rodin repaid the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 his commission and moved the figure to his own garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was Monument to Balzac cast in bronze. It is now thought to be a masterpiece.\nRodin's reputation grew, and he became the top French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Rich private clients sought Rodin's work after his 1900 World's Fair exhibit. For example, a Japanese patron, Matsukata Kojiro, paid for some of Rodin's best castings, including \"The Gates of Hell.\"\nRodin kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives.\nHis sculpture suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917."}

He is considered one of the greatest violinists of today.\nChildhood.\nBell was born in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. His father was a psychologist and therapist. He began violin lessons at the age of four after his mother found that her son had taken rubber bands from around the house and stretched them across the handles of his dresser drawer to pluck out music he had heard her play on the piano. His parents got him a very small violin and started giving him lessons. He learned the violin very quickly, but also had time to enjoy things such as video games and sports. \nBell's first violin teacher suggested that he should learn with Josef Gingold. Bell says that Gingold was a great teacher. At the age of fourteen, Bell appeared as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Muti. He studied the violin at the Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music, while managing to graduate from Bloomington High School North in 1984.\nCareer.\nJoshua Bell first played in the Carnegie Hall, New York in 1985 with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. He has since performed with almost all of the world's major orchestras and conductors. He has played all the well known concertos as well as new works. In 1993 he gave the first performance of Nicholas Maw's violin concerto which was dedicated to him. The recording of this work won Bell a Grammy award. He performed the solo part on John Corigliano's Oscar-winning soundtrack for the movie \"The Red Violin\" and was also featured in \"Ladies in Lavender\". Bell also made an appearance in the movie \"Music of the Heart\", a story about the power of music, with other famous violinists. \nBell's violin is a 300-year-old Stradivarius violin called the Gibson ex Huberman, which was made in 1713, a time when Stradivarius was making his best instruments. This violin had been stolen twice from the previous owner, Bronislaw Huberman; the last time the thief confessed as he was dying to having stolen it. Bell had held and played the violin, and its owner at the time jokingly told Bell the violin could be his for four million dollars. Shortly afterwards, by chance, Bell came across the violin again and discovered it was about to be sold to a wealthy German to become part of a collection. According to the Joshua Bell website Bell \"was practically in tears.\" Bell then sold the Stradivarius violin that he had at the time for a little more than two million dollars and bought the Gibson ex Huberman for a little under the four million dollar asking price. His first recording made with the Gibson ex Huberman was \"Romance of the Violin\". It sold more than 5,000,000 copies and remained at the top of classical music charts for 54 weeks. In September 2006 he made a CD called the \"Voice of the Violin\" and was released in September 2006. It has songs arranged for the violin. He played the song \"Vocalise\" by Rachmaninoff in the Royal Albert Hall at the Last Night of the Proms in 2007. He is a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\nIn an unusual experiment the Washington Post asked Bell to stand in the street and busk (play his violin) by the entrance to a Washington Metro station one cold morning in January 2007. During the 45 minutes that he played more than 1000 people passed him but only a few people stopped to listen, most of whom were children. Only one person recognized him and one other person realized he was a great violinist.\nPersonal life.\nBell lives in Manhattan. He is keen on sports such as golf and tennis. He has three children born by a former girlfriend, however married another woman on 5th October 2019."}

There are three sets of country codes:\nISO 3166-1 is not the only standard for country codes. Many international organizations use their own country codes, where some of them closely correspond to the ISO 3166-1 codes. For examples, see \"country codes\".\nRules for inclusion.\nCurrently, 244 countries and territories have official ISO 3166-1 codes. The only way to enter a new country name into ISO 3166-1 is to have it registered in one of the following two sources:\nTo be listed in the bulletin \"Country Names\", a country or territory must be any of the following:\nOnce a country name or territory name appears in either of these two sources, it will be added to ISO 3166-1 by default.\nOfficially assigned code elements.\nThe following is a complete ISO 3166-1 encoding code list in alphabetical order by the English short country names officially used by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA), which uses country names from United Nations sources.\nThe table includes officially assigned codes only.\nReserved and user-assigned code elements.\nBesides the officially assigned codes, code elements may be expanded by using either reserved codes or user-assigned codes.\nReserved code elements are codes which, while not ISO 3166-1 codes, are in use for some applications in conjunction with the ISO 3166 codes. They are reserved to add flexibility to the coding system. Usually, obsolete codes may be kept as reserved, while some overseas territories, international organizations, and special nationality status have reserved codes of their own.

It was used during the Renaissance. Italian poet-musicians in court in the 15th and 16th centuries often played it to accompany the poems they were reading. The lira da braccio was very similar to the medieval fiddle. Changes continued to be made to the way the lira da braccio was made until the end of the 16th century. In paintings it is often seen being played by the gods Orpheus and Apollo. Sometimes it was used in groups of instruments.\nThe instrument was a similar shape to a violin, but with a wider fingerboard and flatter bridge. It usually had seven strings, five of them tuned like a violin with a low D added to the bottom, and two other strings for drones. It is likely that the player often played the tune on the top strings and chords on the lower strings.\nThe lira da braccio was very popular at court. Later, in the 16th century, the madrigal became very popular and also the violin, so the lira da braccio was used less. It continued to be used in plays, especially when it was associated with Apollo. By the middle of the 17th century people no longer played it."}

It launched the Mercury project space capsules and became the foundation for a family of successful space launch vehicles now built by \"United Launch Alliance\". The Atlas rocket family is today used as a launch platform for commercial and military satellites, and other spacecraft.\nHistory.\nThe Atlas, first tested in 1957, was the United States' first successful ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile).\nAtlas, named for the Atlas of Greek mythology, got its start in 1946 with the award of a United States Army Air Force research contract to Convair for the study of a 1,500 to 5,000\u00a0mi. (2,400 to 8,000\u00a0km) range nuclear armed missile.\nThe missile was originally given the military designation \"XB-65\", thus making it a bomber; from 1955 it was redesignated \"SM-65\" and, from 1962, it became \"CGM-16\". This letter \"C\" stood for \"coffin\" or \"Container\", because the rocket was stored in a semi-hardened container; it was prepared for launch by being raised and fueled in the open. The Atlas-F (HGM-16) was stored vertically underground, but launched after being lifted to the surface."}

The colors are from the French flag. That was the \"First National Flag\".\nThe first Dominican Constitution of 6 November 1844 did not say anything about the distribution of the rectangles but from the start the flag was represented with alternation of the colors (that is, blue and red on top and red and blue on bottom); this is the \"Second National Flag\".

The World Health Organisation (WHO), governments and health workers use it. It is also sometimes called the Quetelet index.\nHistory.\nThe BMI was invented by Adolphe Quetelet between 1830 and 1850. \nA scientist named Ancel Keys first used the term \"body mass index\" in 1972. He wrote that governments should measure the BMI of adults to find out whether they are too fat or too thin.\nCalculation.\nTo find somebody's BMI:\nThis is the formula:\nFor example, a man whose weight is and height is has a BMI of:\nA man whose weight is and height is has a BMI of:\nOverweight or not.\nHealth organisations, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), use the BMI to help decide whether people are too fat or too thin. The WHO uses these numbers for adults:\nSome people disagree with these numbers. Some experts think the \"Overweight\" range for people with Asian body types should be 23\u201327.49, not 25\u201329.99. Some experts think the lowest \"Normal\" BMI should be 20 for men, and 18 for women.\nThe old BMI definition of overweight was 27. This changed in 1998.\nUses.\nBMI is useful for governments who want to know about the health of their people. For example, in the United States in 2007, 74% of adults had a BMI above 25 (\"Overweight\" or \"Obese\") and 27% of adults had a BMI above 30 (\"Obese\"). Many of these people will become ill because they are too fat. This information helps the United States government decide what to do about the health of its people.\nBMI is less useful for finding out whether one person is too fat or too thin. BMI does not say how much weight is fat, how much is muscle and how much is bone. For example, many athletes have a high BMI. They are not fat. Their BMI is high because they have lots of heavy muscle. Other people have lots of fat and not much muscle. They are too fat but their BMI is normal.\nEven so, BMI is popular. It is easy to use and easy to understand, and it gives useful information for people with \"normal\" bodies.\nVariations.\nThe Ponderal Index is similar to the body mass index, but the height is cubed, not squared. The formula is:\nSome experts suggest that the exponent should be between 2.3 and 2.7. The best formula might be:"}

There is no fixed age, but most people think it begins when someone is about 40 years old, until the person is 64 years old.\nIn most countries, people that think that by middle age, people should be mature, perhaps with a good, steady job and a family. Due to promotion, middle age is sometimes a time when adults have greater wealth and influence than earlier in their careers, although they may have less disposable income due to having children. However, it is also common for some adults to suffer from mid-life crisis, when they are unsure about their life and sometimes become depressed because of it. Women and men often have different experiences of middle age partly depending on whether they choose to work or care for their family full-time.\nHealth.\nMiddle-aged people begin to look older, with more wrinkles in their skin, and start to have grey hair. They become less fit and usually gain more weight. \nMiddle-aged females find it harder to become pregnant. If they do have a baby, there is a higher chance that it will have a genetic disease (Down syndrome, for example).

Both of these have benefits and drawbacks: The 2.4 GHz band is widely used, and devices are usually cheaper. Microwave ovens, DECT telephones and other wireless devices also use the 2.4 GHz band, and sometimes cause interference which slows transmissions. The 5 GHz band has more frequencies and usually less interference, but there are more rules for using it. In some places, the 5 GHz band may not be used outdoors. Because fewer devices use the 5 GHz band, devices that do are often more expensive.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says that Wi-Fi is not dangerous."}

It was the tenth tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed as a subtropical depression on September 21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the contact of a tropical wave, the end of a cold front, and a low pressure system. Originally, the system had a disorganized circulation and thunderstorm patterns, but later turned into a tropical depression after convection became more organized over the center. Moving northwestward, the depression came onto land near Fort Walton Beach early on September 22, and shortly later, it dissipated over southeastern Alabama. The depression caused only light damages to the area and was limited to light rainfall, although the system that would later become \"Tropical Depression 10\" created a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida.\nStorm history.\nBy September 17, the contact between a tropical wave and the end of a cold front created huge amounts of thunderstorms over the Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. An upper-level low over western Florida created more convection across the area, and on September 18 the system began moving towards Florida. Originally, the system was very disorganized, but surface pressures slowly went down across the area, with a weak low pressure area forming on September 19. A Hurricane Hunters aircraft was sent to fly into the system on September 20 reported an organized low and strong wind gusts in the storm as it moved into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, along with little and disorganized thunderstorm activity. Convection slowly became better organized, with a well-defined rainband in its eastern half and irregular thunderstorm activity near the center. In spite of its bad organization, with a disorganized circulation and an upper-level low aloft, the National Hurricane Center started advisories on \"Subtropical Depression Ten\" at 1500\u00a0UTC on September 21 while it was located about 40\u00a0miles (60\u00a0km) south of St. Vincent Island, Florida, stating \"the potential for additional development right along the coastline.\"\nWith a mid-level ridge to its northwest, the subtropical depression was predicted to move alongside with the coastline of Florida and Alabama. As an outcome, the cyclone was forecasted to have winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) and move onto land on southern Mississippi. The circulation became better organized as convection modestly increased over the center, and within 6\u00a0hours of its formation, the system turned into a tropical depression. The cyclone continued moving northwestward, making landfall around 0000\u00a0UTC on September 22 near Fort Walton Beach, Florida with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). The cloud pattern began to become disorganized as it moved inland, and 3\u00a0hours after it moved ashore the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on the depression. As the depression continued into Alabama, it became more disorganized, and by 0900\u00a0UTC on September 22 the cyclone collapsed into a remnant low pressure area.\nPreparations and impact.\nAt the same time the National Hurricane Center gave out its first advisory on the depression, they also gave out a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola, Florida to the delta of the Mississippi River. Shortly thereafter, an inland tropical storm warning was given out for Pearl River, Walthall, and Pike counties in Mississippi and Washington Parish in Louisiana. Also, the New Orleans National Weather Service gave out a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana. In Mississippi, Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of emergency. Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for people living in areas of low lands and in mobile homes for Jackson, Harrison, and Hancock counties. Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters, stating the possible need of shelter for citizens in about 17,000\u00a0FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina. Because of the threat of the cyclone, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco also declared a state of emergency and placed the state's National Guard and other disaster services on stand-by.\nBefore of the depression's development, several oil and gas companies removed unneeded workers from offshore oil platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico; the Shell Oil Company evacuated about 700\u00a0employees, while Noble Energy removed its workforce of about 300\u00a0people from two oil rigs. Exxon Mobil stopped its production by about 1,000\u00a0barrels of oil and 55,000\u00a0ft\u00b3 (1,500\u00a0m\u00b3). With 27.7% of the daily crude oil production stopped because of the depression, oil prices rose higher after days of increasing levels, and on September 20 reached a record rate of over $84 per barrel.\nTogether, the wind shear and low-level helicity created moderate convection across central Florida associated with the precursor low pressure system. Late on September 20, a supercell formed near Lake Apopka, and moved quickly northward it created an EF1 tornado near Eustis; the tornado moved around for about 2\u00a0miles (3\u00a0km) and reached winds of about 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The tornado destroyed 20\u00a0homes, left 30\u00a0others severely damaged, and injured one person, and cut power for about 300\u00a0people. The depression also created waves of about 5\u00a0feet (1.5\u00a0m) and rip currents along the west coast of Florida. Outer rainbands began affecting coastal sections of western Florida by about 12\u00a0hours before the formation of the depression. Precipitation in the state reached 2.83\u00a0inches (71.9\u00a0mm) in Crestview. In other places, rainfall totals reached 1.46\u00a0inches (37.1\u00a0mm) in Albany, Georgia and 0.51\u00a0inches (13\u00a0mm) in Dothan, Alabama."}

The line was launched on December 30, 2000 in Europe and June/July 2001 in Canada and the United States. \"Bionicle\" is a portmanteau constructed from the words \"biological\" and \"chronicle\", which is also actually derived from the word \"bionics\". The concept is similar to Lego Group's earlier themes, Slizers/Throwbots and RoboRiders in that each of those lines had characters based on classical elements. Earlier Bionicle packages had displayed the Technic Logo, but it has since been phased out, evolving Bionicle into its own branch of LEGO. It has recently been announced by the director of LEGO that they will stop making new Bionicle sets after Winter 2010 \"for the foreseeable future\". However, while production of sets will stop, the story will not, as Greg Farshtey will continue to update it on the website. Bionicle was replaced by Hero Factory, which was released later in July 2010.\nThe Bionicle story is set in a science fantasy world and is primarily told through the book series, Bionicle Chronicles, Bionicle Adventures, and Bionicle Legends as well as through comic books published by DC Comics. Four films have also been made. As of 2010, the main Bionicle story will be published online.\nThe 2001\u20132008 Bionicle story arc was set in a world inhabited predominantly by part-organic, part-machine beings (most notably the Matoran) in a subterranean world, which exists in massive domes underground. 2009 began a new saga of the story-line, leaving behind the previous years and venturing out to newer possibilities as Mata Nui, after having been banished by Makuta Teridax, finds his way to a mysterious barren planet called Bara Magna. Here he becomes the center of the story and makes new allies as he tries to find a way to save the Matoran from Makuta Teridax's tyrannical rule.\nProduction.\nThe concept of Bionicle was proposed in 2000. During that time, Lego was suffering a ten-year downturn. In 1998, the company suffered its first loss, resulting layoffs for the first time with 1000 people being laid off the following year. In January 2004, Lego posted a loss of 1.4 billion Danish kroner (140 million British pounds and 223.86 million USD). A few weeks earlier, in order to \"stabilise its financial situation,\" another 500 jobs were cut.\nInitially, the idea of Bionicle was faced with resistance from \"company traditionalists\" as Lego had \"no experience of creating the kind of story-based, multichannel brand that was being proposed.\" Also, the war-like appearance of the Bionicle characters went against the company's values: \"high-quality products, an emphasis on free play and encouraging the imagination, and no modern warfare or violence.\"\nHowever, the Bionicle line soon became the \"biggest of the recent hits\" and the number one product of Lego in 2003. The series made its first debut in virtual form on the web in December 2000. In 2004, the sets accounted for approximately all of Lego's turnover. As the sets were produced, Lego developed them on the sets' website through \"character bios and an episodic adventure game.\" The main storyline is developed by a team of eight people around the world, who decide \"which media gets which bit of the story.\" Because the Bionicle story is told through multiple media (books, comics, and movies), the purpose of the website is to put the different parts together. The practice of making every Bionicle product \"from toys to toothbrushes\" promote the website resulted in web traffic averaging more than a million page views per month in August 2004. Another strategy used to promote the website was the use of \"Kanoka points\". Each toy packaging had special access codes that allows users to earn the points (\"the Bionicle equivalent of a loyalty scheme\") that can be used to play web games.\nStory.\nThe 2001\u20132008 storyline arc of Bionicle was set in a science fantasy world inhabited predominantly by part-organic, part-machine beings in a subterranean world, which exists in massive domes underground. This world (dubbed \"The Matoran Universe\") and its races were once protected by a Great Spirit named Mata Nui, until he was cast into an eternal slumber by the evil Makuta Teridax and the Brotherhood of Makuta. The world of the Matoran began to fall apart. But mask of life that was stored inside Mata Nui was sent out to space to find a new planet. The mask landed on the planet of Bara Magna and the mask created a small body.\n2009 began a whole new saga of the story-line, leaving behind the previous years, and venturing out to newer possibilities as Mata Nui, after having been banished by Makuta Teridax, crash lands on a mysterious barren planet, called Bara Magna. Here he becomes the center of the story, and makes new allies as he tries to find a way to save the Matoran and the Toa from Makuta Teridax's tyrannical rule.\n2001 \u2013 Quest for the Masks.\nThe story begins with six Toa Mata: Tahu, Lewa, Gali, Kopaka, Pohatu, and Onua, arriving on an island known as the Island of Mata Nui, remembering nothing beyond their names. They discovered that the inhabitants, the Matoran villagers, face constant attacks from infected Rahi, savage beasts controlled by the powerful influence of Makuta Teridax through use of Infected Kanohi masks, causing a war which lasted about 1000 years. After searching for and finding numerous Kanohi masks, the Toa each receive a Golden Kanohi mask with tremendous power and seek out Makuta himself. After challenging the ferocious Manas crabs and the Shadow Toa (evil doppelganger-like illusional replicas of the Toa ), the Toa confront Makuta and defeat him by uniting their elemental powers.\n2002 \u2013 The Bohrok Swarms.\nUpon his defeat, Makuta released the ancient Bohrok. Bohrok are robotic drones that were designed to \"cleanse\" the island of Mata Nui to its state \"in the before-time\". The Bohrok began to tear through the villages on the island, forcing Matoran to flee. One inventive Matoran of Earth, Nuparu, builds a powerful vehicle called the Boxor, made from parts of a damaged Bohrok in order to fight off the swarms. The Toa, unaware of the Bohrok's purpose, collected the Bohrok's Krana (mask-like creatures that function as their brains) to confront the Bohrok Queens, the Bahrag: Cahdok and Gahdok. The defeated Cahdok and Gahdok are sealed in a prison created by the Toa's elemental powers. The Toa Mata are then exposed to a substance called Energized Protodermis, which transforms them, granting them new armor and weapons. They renamed themselves the \"Toa Nuva\".\n2003 \u2013 The Bohrok-Kal Strike and the Mask of Light.\nWith Cahdok and Gahdok defeated, the Bohrok Swarms are stopped and returned to their hives. However, six new elite Bohrok, called the Bohrok-Kal, appeared with the purpose of releasing the Bahrag. They then proceeded to steal the Toa Nuva's powers, which are the key to breaking the seal. On the verge of defeat, the Toa force all of their powers into the Bohrok-Kal, overloading and defeating them. \nShortly afterwards, two Matoran, Takua and Jaller, discovered the Kanohi Mask of Light. They were tasked with traveling across the island of Mata Nui to find the Toa of Light. Meanwhile, Makuta created and sent out six creatures called Rahkshi to find the mask and stop the coming of the Toa of Light. The Rahkshi tore across Mata Nui, destroying the villages of Ta-Koro and Onu-Koro. The Rahkshi were stopped by the Toa, but not before killing Jaller. Jaller's death caused Takua to realize he was the Toa of Light, and he donned the mask to become Toa Takanuva. Takanuva went to confront Makuta and, during their battle, they both fell into a pool of energized protodermis, a silvery substance with the power to change or destroy a being, and became fused together into the being Takutanuva. Takutanuva then proceeded to open the door to the city of Metru Nui, allowing the Matoran and Toa through. Using some of his life energy, he revived Jaller while still holding the door open. However, the use of energy was too great and Takutanuva was crushed by the door, seeming to kill both Takanuva and Teridax, leaving only Takanuva's Mask of Light. Takanuva was promptly revived when his mask was used to activate the beacon to Metru Nui. Afterwards, the Matoran prepared to return to the island city of Metru Nui.\n2004 \u2013 Legends of Metru Nui.\nAs the Matoran prepared to journey to Metru Nui, the Turaga (village elders) revealed that they had once been Toa, fighting in Metru Nui against threats such as the Morbuzakh plant creature and the Dume-controlled Vahki enforcement squads. They, as Matoran, were transformed into the Toa Metru by Toa stones containing power sacrificed by Toa Lhikan. Their mission was to find the six Great Disks and defeat the Morbuzakh, a plant menace that threatened to destroy the city. When they did, however, they were betrayed by Dume, the Turaga of the city. Later, they discovered that Makuta Teridax had taken the disguise of Dume and taken control of the Vahki (law enforcement robots). His plan was to put the Matoran to sleep, wipe out their memories, and reawaken them \"as their conqueror.\" The Toa fled, but were attacked by Teridax. Combining their elemental powers, they were able to seal Teridax in a prison of crystallized protodermis. The Toa traveled to a new island, which would later be known as Mata Nui, vowing to return to save the Matoran.\n2005 \u2013 Web of Shadows.\nThey do return. However, the evil king Sidorak and his viceroy Roodaka had been reigning on the island, with vicious spider-like creatures called Visorak. The Toa were soon captured and mutated into bestial Toa Hordika. To revert to normal, the Toa sought out the legendary Rahi Keetongu. Toa Vakama, however, betrayed the other Toa and joined Sidorak, who made him the leader of the Visorak. The other Toa confronted the Visorak horde in a great battle, and convinced Vakama to rejoin them. Vakama then ordered the Visorak to be free. Keetongu then killed Sidorak, whom Roodaka and Vakama betrayed. The six Toa then defeated Roodaka with all six of their elemental powers. However, this had the side effect of freeing Makuta because Roodaka carried a fragment of his prison. The Toa struck her for this reason. Having been restored by Keetongu, the Toa Metru brought the Matoran to a new island. When they sacrificed their power to awaken the Matoran, they become Turaga, and later established new villages on this island called Mata Nui.\n2006 \u2013 Island of Doom.\nThe Toa Nuva learned that Mata Nui was not only asleep but dying. To save him, they must travel to the island of Voya Nui and seek the mysterious Kanohi Ignika, the Mask of Life. The Toa Nuva set out on this adventure but are quickly taken prisoner by six new and powerful enemies, the Piraka: Zaktann, Hakann, Vezok, Thok, Reidak, and Avak. They sought the mask for their own dark purposes. When the Toa failed to return, a group of six Matoran followed after them. Jaller, Hahli, Hewkii, Nuparu, Kongu, and Matoro escaped to the island in Toa canisters, but as they traveled, bolts of lighting from the Red Star transformed them into the Toa Inika. Upon their arrival, they learn of the Piraka and how they enslaved the local Matoran by posing as false Toa, in order to make the Matoran build them a fortress. With the help of a small Matoran Resistance and the ancient guardian Axonn, the Toa Inika were able to free the Toa Nuva, find the temple of the mask, and battle the Piraka as well as the other creatures guarding it. They eventually emerged victorious with the Kanohi. But the Mask of Life possessed a will of its own, and in the last moment evades them all, rushing into the depths of the sea.\n2007 \u2013 Sea of Darkness.\nFollowing the chase for the Mask of Life, the Toa Inika descended into the waters after receiving the mysterious clue \"save the sunken city\" from an unknown Matoran, who had saved Hahli from drowning at the cost of him dying from decompression sickness.[14] A burst of energy from the Mask of Life transformed the Toa Inika into water-breathing forms. They discovered an inhabited village of Mahri Nui that had broken off from Voya Nui and sunk a thousand years ago. The village was threatened by ancient warlords known as Barraki that had been mutated by the nearby mutagenic waters called \"The Pit\". The Toa, now known as Toa Mahri, faced off against the Barraki to survive. However, by the time the Toa retrieved the mask, the Great Spirit died. Realizing there was still hope, Toa Matoro rushed to the core of the universe and sacrificed his life to revive Mata Nui. In the last moments of his life, Toa Matoro used the Mask's power to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and allow them to breathe air again. The Great Spirit's life was saved but he still had to be awakened.\n2008 \u2013 The Final Battle.\nAfter being given new armor and weapons by Artakha, the Toa Nuva arrived at Karda Nui, the core of the universe. There, they came to face the Makuta who were trying to turn the population of Av-Matoran \u2013 Matoran of Light \u2013 into Shadow Matoran. The Toa Nuva were helped by the arrival of Takanuva, now able to control Light and Shadow because of a shadow leech attack, and Toa Ignika, who is the Mask of Life itself. The Kanohi Ignika had made a body for itself because it wished to see what it was like to be a living being. With their combined forces, they reached a structure in the center of Karda Nui called the Codrex, where Toa Ignika had to sacrifice his new body to awaken Mata Nui. Takanuva, with the help of the remaining uncorrupted Av-Matoran, returned the Shadow Matoran to their previous states. Shortly afterwards, the Toa escaped the core before the energy storm caused by Mata Nui's awakening could destroy them. The Makuta, however, failed to escape, and were all killed. Back in Metru Nui, Mata Nui's awakening was celebrated, but celebration was cut short when it was revealed that Teridax had taken over the body of Mata Nui, revealed to be the universe of the Matoran. Trapping the spirit of Mata Nui in the Mask of Life, he sent it flying into space so that the former Great Spirit cannot interfere with his control over the universe.\n2009 \u2013 The Legend Reborn.\nThe Bionicle story continues after Mata Nui was banished from his body by Makuta Teridax, onto a planet called Bara Magna. With the exception of a few wildlife species, Bara Magna is a barren desert planet which only supports few resources, so each tribe on the planet has a few warriors, called Glatorian, to battle for them. These resources, such as food and water, are distributed accordingly. The villagers of this world are known as Agori. The Agori together make up six different tribes, each affiliated with a region. After the Mask of Life lands on Bara Magna, it creates a body for Mata Nui to use. Mata Nui then teams up with a few Glatorian to defeat the combined forces of the Skrall and Bone Hunters, two major threats to the villages, and look for a way to return to his body. With the help of his new Glatorian and Agori friends he exposes a traitor known as Metus and defeats the Skrall and Bone Hunters. He helps the villages of the world to unite, taking all of the giant pieces of robot and linking them into a large prototype robotic body, a body like the one the Matoran Universe resides in.\n2010 \u2013 Journey's End.\nAfter defeating the Skrall and seeing the rest of the villages unite, Mata Nui stands against the challenge of taking back his old body from Teridax. He learns that he was created by the Great Beings on the planet of Spherus Magna, which is now divided into a jungle moon (Bota Magna), an ocean moon (Aqua Magna), and the remaining desert planet (Bara Magna), as the result of the Core War. Mata Nui also learns that before he was built, there was a previous robot, which the Agori use as their home. An Agori of Tesara named Tarduk helps Mata Nui by showing him an ancient power source that could power up the old robot.\nIn this final journey, two heroes return to finish the fight: Tahu, returned to his original form to wear the powerful Golden Armor, and Takanuva. They are aided by Gresh. They fight off the Skakdi Warlord, Nektann to defeat Makuta, and his army; hordes of Rahkshi, armed with heat vision; and Skrall.\nThe story continues as the forces of both the Matoran Universe and Glatorian face the oncoming onslaught of Skakdi, Rahkshi, and Skrall. The golden armour, scattered by Makuta's blast is collected by Tahu, Gresh, and Takanuva from the many enemies. Tahu defeats Skakdi warlord Nektann, and then dons the armour, which incinerates every Rahkshi Kraata on Bara Magna.\nTeridax claims that he will destroy Bara Magna with gravitic energy, until Mata Nui forces his arm upwards, causing Teridax to send the energy wave to the moons above. Mata Nui pushes Teridax back into one of the onrushing moons, the green moon of Bota Magna, whose impact destroys his core processor, which kills Teridax. Mata Nui then mourns the brother that he could have had, in his mind.\nThe finale concludes when Mata Nui uses his strength, and the power of the Mask of Life, to bring Spherus Magna together once more, to heal those who were mutated by Pit Mutagen, to bring life back to the planet, and to reconstruct destroyed geographical features. The strain causes his power core to dissipate, destroying the prototype robot. When the Glatorian and Toa discover the Ignika unscathed in the location where Mata Nui was, Mata Nui speaks to them from within the Mask of Life. He tells them that the future is their own and theirs to build. He then remains dormant in the Ignika. The Agori, Matoran, Toa, Glatorian and all others begin a new life on Spherus Magna.\nFuture of Bionicle.\nThe Bionicle toyline drew to a close in late 2009, after the 2010 sets were finalized for release, and was replaced in the summer of 2010 by Hero Factory, a Lego theme that\u00b4s compatible with Bionicle sets. But despite this, the story is continuing in serials written by Greg Farshtey online at BIONICLEstory.com .\nReception.\nThe Bionicle franchise has been well received, with one reviewer describing the sets as \"good combination of assembly and action figure\" and first-year sales of 100 million British pounds (161.7 million USD). Bionicle had received a Toy of the Year Award for Most Innovative Toy in 2001 from the Toy Industry Association.\nM\u0101ori language controversy.\nIn 2001, several M\u0101ori tribal groups from New Zealand threatened legal action against Lego for allegedly trademarking M\u0101ori words used in naming the Bionicle product range. In response, a Lego spokesperson stated that only the term \"Bionicle\" had been trademarked. Lego agreed to stop commercial use of the M\u0101ori language after sending an executive to meet with M\u0101ori representatives in New Zealand. Some M\u0101ori terms used by Lego were changed, such as \"Huki\", which was changed to \"Hewkii\", and \"Tohunga\", which was changed to \"Matoran\". Within the fictional Bionicle universe, these changes were explained by the introduction of a \"Naming Day\" holiday, in which characters who have done heroic deeds for their village are honored by having the spelling of their name changed (though the pronunciation remains the same). However, a number of M\u0101ori terms such as \"Toa\", which means \"warrior\", \"Kanohi\", which means \"face\", and \"Kopaka\", which means \"cold\", were not changed. Since this controversy, Lego has not made any more names that are common terms in other living languages (with the exception of Umbra, a Latin word, and some names that are real names in some languages).\nImpact.\nThe rapid success of Bionicle has had a major impact on the Lego company. According to Stephanie Lawrence, the global director of licensing for Lego, \"We've created an evergreen franchise to complement the many event-based properties on the children's market. An increasing number of category manufacturers want to tap into the power of the BIONICLE universe, and the key for us now is to manage the excitement to stay true to the brand and the lifestyle of our core consumer.\" According to one source, Bionicle has changed the way children think of, and play with, LEGO products by combining \"the best of LEGO building with the story telling and adventure of an action figure line,\" and that 85% of American boys age 6\u201312 know of the Bionicle brand and 45% own the toys.\nMusic.\nPaul Hardcastle and Simon Fuller produced the first soundtracks for Bionicle's commercials used in 2001 to 2003. Music for the first three Bionicle films featured a more classical tune, rather that the techno-like beats used in the ads and animations. In 2005, the first official Bionicle songs were released. They were produced by rock band All Insane Kids and are called \"Hero\" and \"Caught In A Dream\" (the latter being used as the theme of Bionicle 3). Further down Bionicle's history, more songs were used to help advertise their sets, most of which were produced by Danish band Cryoshell, as well as songs by other artists, like \"Crashed\" by Daughtry and \"Move Along\" by The All-American Rejects."}

Brother cities was the name of twinned cities in the old Soviet bloc. \nTwin towns often (but not always) have similar populations, industries and other characteristics. Sometimes, even larger areas enter into \"twinning\" agreements, such as that between the provinces of Hainan in China and Jeju in South Korea.\nEurope.\nThe earliest form of town twinning in Europe was between the German city of Paderborn and the French city of Le Mans in 836, although this was not officially established as a modern town twinning arrangement until 1967.\nCoventry, United Kingdom was the first ever city to \"twin\" with another city (Stalingrad, Soviet Union) and hence began the modern practice of twinning. \nAfter the Second World War twinning was a way to bring European people into a closer understanding of each other and to promote cross-border projects and peace. \nFor example, Coventry twinned with Dresden as an act of peace and reconciliation, both cities having been heavily bombed during the war. Each twin city country is represented in a specific ward of the city and in each ward has a peace garden dedicated to that twin city. \nAnother early example of town twinning dates back to 1947 when Bristol Corporation (later Bristol City Council) sent five 'leading citizens' on a goodwill mission to Hanover.\nTwinning is more popular in Europe than anywhere else, but the idea has now spread to other continents.\nSince 1989, the European Union has had a support scheme for town twinning. In 2003 an annual budget of about 12 million euros was given to about 1,300 projects.\nNorth America.\nThe first city in North America to establish a sister city relationship was Toledo, Ohio, United States, with Toledo, Spain in 1931. In 1944, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada twinned with the Ukrainian city of Odessa, which at the time was part of the Soviet Union. This was to show support and to help the allied port city during World War II."}

The term Buffyverse was created by the fans of the shows and later used by Whedon as the name for his world. The term has also been used in the titles of published works.\nThe Buffyverse is a world where Vampires and demons exist. Many different types of fictional creatures and monsters can be found in this world. These creatures include werewolves, ghosts, trolls, and witches. It is a world where magic is used often. Most of the people in the Buffyverse do not know that these creatures live in this world or that magic exists.\nNotable features.\nThe Slayer.\nThe Slayer or \"Chosen One\" is a young girl with super-human strength, agility and stamina. It is her destiny to fight evil. When one Slayer is killed, a new girl is \"chosen\" to become the new Slayer. The new slayer has all of the power of the last Slayer as soon as she is chosen. The new Slayer also begins to have dreams that tell her of her future and Slayers from the past.\nThe first Slayer was created long before written history by a group of men who looked like Aborigine. She was created by combine her with a demon. As each Slayer is killed, the demon moves to the next slayer. It gives her the powers of the Slayer as well as the dreams of its past with the other slayers.\nHellmouth.\nIn the Buffyverse there are many different \"dimensions\" or worlds. Some are full of evil. A place where the borders between the normal world and an evil dimension are weak is called a Hellmouth. Evil in the normal world will naturally move towards a hellmouth. The area closest to a hellmouth will be home to much evil and strange circumstances.\nThere are two well known hellmouths in the Buffyverse. The first is located in Sunnydale, California. This is the place where the stories in \"Buffy\" take place. It is the largest and most powerful hellmouth in the Buffyverse. The second hellmouth is in Cleveland, Ohio.

Its effect is to remove genetic variation from a population of living organisms.\nIn natural populations there are a number of forces acting. There are forces which add heritable variation to the population, such as mutation and recombination. There are also factors which remove variation from the population, and drift is one of these.\nOverview.\nIn a species, or an interbreeding population, there is usually a great deal of genetic variation. This genetic variation is in the form of different alleles at many loci (gene positions) on the chromosomes.\nChanges in allele frequency are mainly caused by natural selection, that is, by differential survival, and contribution to the next generation. But as populations get smaller, there is a tendency for each generation to become more homozygous, with less variety of alleles. This is an effect similar to inbreeding: it leads to genetic uniformity.\nGenetic drift is the name given to this loss of variation. It can affect evolution in surprisingly big ways, but \"only when populations are quite small\". What 'small' means would depend on the organism. 50 individuals is small, 5000 is not, 500 is maybe. The basic mechanism of drift is that genetic variety is reduced by chance, making the individuals more similar to each other, and hence more vulnerable."}

At some levels, various legislation has created alternative types of administrative division.\nRegional level.\nAt the top level, England is divided into nine regions. Each one containing one or more county-level areas. The regions were created in 1994 and since the 1999 Euro-elections have been used as England's European Parliament constituencies. All have the same status. However London is the only region with any devolved power in the form of an elected mayor and the Greater London Authority. The regions also vary greatly in their areas and their populations.\nCounty level.\nEngland is divided by the Lieutenancies Act 1997 into areas for the appointment of Lord Lieutenants, who are historically the Crown's representative in a county. Although not actually defined as such, these areas have become known as ceremonial counties. These counties are sometimes used by people when describing where they live in England. However, many are not used as local government areas themselves, as many are too large or include large urban areas. They are taken into consideration though when drawing up Parliamentary constituency boundaries for example.\nFor administrative purposes, England is divided into four types of county-level subnational entities used for local governance.\nMetropolitan county.\nThere are six metropolitan counties, divided into metropolitan boroughs, which cover large urban areas outside London. They were created in 1974. In 1986 their county councils were abolished.\nShire county.\nThe \"shire counties\" were also created in 1974 and are legally known as non-metropolitan counties. They are divided into non-metropolitan districts and cover much of the country, though mainly the rural areas.\nUnitary authority.\nUnitary authorities were created in the 1990s and are single-tier authorities which combine the functions of county and district councils. They are defined either as counties consisting of a single district or districts of a county such as Berkshire that has no county council. The Isle of Wight is the exception, being a county council with no districts.\nGreater London.\nGreater London was created in 1965 and is sometimes considered as a metropolitan county but it is not defined as such. It is divided into the City of London and London boroughs.\nDistrict level.\nDistricts in England may also have the status of borough, city or royal borough.\nMetropolitan district.\nThe metropolitan counties were divided into metropolitan districts which are usually called boroughs. When the county councils were abolished the metropolitan districts gained much of their powers and therefore function similar to other unitary authorities.\nNon-metropolitan district.\nShire counties are divided into non-metropolitan districts. Power is shared with the county council, but shared differently to the metropolitan counties when first created.\nParish level.\nThe civil parish is the most local unit of government in England. Under the legislation that created Greater London, they are not permitted within its boundary. Not all of the rest of England is parished, though the number of parishes and total area parished is growing.\nExceptions.\nThe following are exceptions to the general arrangements for local government in England and as a consequence are separately listed in legislation from the above types of local authorities where functions are allocated to particular groups of local authorities.\nLondon boroughs.\nIn Greater London, the 32 London borough councils have a status close to that of unitary authorities, but there is also a higher strategic tier, the Greater London Authority, which oversees some of the functions performed elsewhere by Counties including transport, policing, the fire brigade and also economic development.\nCity of London.\nAs well as the same general functions performed by the surrounding London boroughs, the City of London has others which make it distinct from most local authorities, including extraterritorial possessions (such as Hampstead Heath and Queens Park recreation ground in Kilburn) and services (including veterinary services at Heathrow Airport and domestic asbestos disposal) elsewhere in Greater London.\nInner and Middle Temples.\nInner Temple and Middle Temple are small liberties within the boundary of the City of London which function as their own local authorities.\nIsles of Scilly.\nThe Isles of Scilly have a \"sui generis\" local authority, the Isles of Scilly Council, which is similar to a unitary authority found in the rest of England.\nChanges proposed in 2004.\nA referendum was held in North East England on November 4, 2004 to see whether people there wished to have an elected regional assembly. As part of the referendum, voters were to have been asked to choose which system of unitary authorities they would like to see in the existing county council areas if the regional assembly was approved. In the event, the vote in the North East was a decisive \"no\", making the proposed local government changes moot.\nSimilar referendums in North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber were postponed indefinitely: on 8 November 2004 the Deputy Prime Minister announced \"I will not therefore be bringing forward orders for referendums in either the North West, or Yorkshire and the Humber\". *Statement by Deputy Prime Minister \nMost of the proposed changes would have required no change in the county level entites, as they could have been be implemented by merging districts and abolition of the county council. Where borders were crossed, however, changes would have been needed. This impacted Lancashire, where various parts were proposed for combination with Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen (both unitaries), Sefton (in Merseyside), Wigan (in Greater Manchester), and southern Cumbria; it also affects one proposal for North Yorkshire, which would have merged the district of Selby with the East Riding of Yorkshire. Few of the boundary changes would have involved creating new borders - only the proposals to combine Blackpool with parts of Wyre, and to split West Lancashire between Wigan and Sefton would do this.\nChanges under consideration in 2007.\nOn 27 March, 2007, Local Government Minister Phil Woolas announced that sixteen councils bidding for unitary status had been short listed to go forward for public consultation. On 26 July, 2007 Wollas' successor John Healey announced that nine proposals would proceed, subject to the approval of Parliament in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill (LGPIH). The Government expects those approved for implementation to be fully operational by April 2009. The short-listed proposals were those made by:\n[*] - the Boundary Committee is asked to advise whether an alternative unitary proposal for Norwich based on revised council boundaries could deliver the required improvements.\n[**] - if Bedford Borough Council\u2019s proposals are implemented other authorities in Bedfordshire including Bedfordshire County Council will be invited to propose a unitary solution for the remaining area of Bedfordshire."}

{"id": "72086", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72086", "title": "Realism", "text": "Realism is a way of portraying or thinking about reality. The word \"realism\" is used in many liberal arts in many different ways (such as in music, painting, and philosophy). It usually means trying to be true to reality. This is where the word \"realistic\" comes from. Realism is usually seen as an opposite of romanticism and idealism. It is also sometimes seen as an opposite of liberalism and classicism. It is used mainly to describe the way that some artists treat making art. These artists try to focus on the world as it really is, without unrealistic or supernatural ideas.\nRealism began as an art movement and in the 19th century. These realists wanted to give an accurate description of nature and of the way people lived. Realism can also apply to artists and artworks from before the 19th century though.\nOrigins.\nThe word \"realism\" first appeared in 1794, as the opposite of idealism in art and philosophy. The French magazine () used the word in 1826. It said that realism was the art-style of being accurate to real life, rather than following art of the past. Around this same time, realism was thought to have been one of the styles of philosophy within scholasticism. Then in the 1840s, realism began as an art movement in France. It focused on realistic modern life without avoiding what was unpleasant. It also focused on the lower or middle classes.\nRealism in liberal arts.\nIn music.\nIn music there was a movement called Verismo which was the Italian word for \"reality\". Verismo was popular in Italian opera around the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. Puccini was an opera composer whose style is typical of Verismo.\nIn politics and history.\nIn politics, realism focuses on conflict and the harsher parts of history.\nIn writing and philosophy.\nRealism as a literary movement began in Germany. The poet and writer Heinrich Heine tried in his books to accept the world as it is instead of trying to escape from it. Realistic writers tried to find good things about society. The interest in realism led to a movement called naturalism. This meant describing scenes in nature accurately. The novelist Emile Zola was a naturalist.\nIn philosophy, realism is also a way of thinking about knowledge and reality. It is usually the view that a particular thing is real whether or not it is known about. In fact, one person can be a realist about some things and a non-realist about other things. For example, some realists say that the past really happened no matter what we think about it. Other realist philosophers say that there are morals that really exist as facts. This is different from philosophers who say that things only exist because of people who are aware of them. For example, a non-realist philosopher might say beauty only exists because someone sees something that they think is beautiful. A realist philosopher might instead say that beauty is there whether anyone sees it or not.\nOther styles.\nThe term social realism describes an art form in America in the 1930s which expressed social protest in a naturalistic way. This is different from what is usually called socialist realism which was a term used by Soviet politicians from 1932 to the mid 1980s to describe art which showed the workers' struggle, glorifying the Soviet Union.\nIn the early 20th century Realism led to other movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism."}

PCP is called a hallucinogenic drug: it causes people to hallucinate, and see, hear, and sense things that are not real. PCP is neurotoxic. It causes changes to the brain that can leave permanent damage. Before people started using PCP as an illegal drug, it was used as an anesthetic.\nPCP is a white powder, made of tiny crystals. It dissolves easily in water or alcohol. PCP has many slang or 'street names'; the most common is \"angel dust\". Other slang names for PCP are angel hair, angel mist, aurora borealis, black whack, crystal, cyclones, devil dust, dummy dust, embalming fluid, hallucinogen, horse tranquilizer, jet fuel, magic dust, rocket fuel, or star dust. PCP is sometimes mixed with marijuana and called love boat or killer weed. PCP can also be mixed with crack; this is called \"space basing\".\nHistory.\nPCP was created after World War II as a surgical anesthetic. It worked well, but there were serious side effects: hallucinations, jumbled speech, and delirium. Around the mid-to-late 1960s, the drug sprang up on the streets of San Francisco as a \"Peace Pill.\" People soon realized that it was a very dangerous drug. In the San Francisco area, the use of PCP died out before the 1970s. At the same time, the drug was becoming more common in New York, and it spread quickly there. However, its use in this area died out, like in San Francisco. The United States made it illegal to use PCP for any reason, or to make the drug, because of its serious effects.\nEffects.\nPeople can have many different effects from using PCP. The drug can affect the central nervous system (the brain and major nerves). This can cause many changes in the brain and body.\nChanges in senses.\nPCP often causes major changes in what a person senses (what he feels, sees, hears, smells, or tastes). For example:\nChanges in the body.\nPCP can also cause people to have a lot of energy, feel and act stronger than usual, and not feel pain.\nHow the drug is used.\nPCP can be eaten, snorted, injected (shot into the body using a needle), or smoked. A person can take a low, medium, or high dose of PCP, and he will have different effects depending on which dose he takes. Low doses can cause a person to feel euphoric (very happy), relaxed, numb, detached from his own body, anxious, or confused. At low doses, people can also have sensory distortions (changes in how they hear, see, taste, smell, or feel things); amnesia (where the person cannot remember things normally); speech which does not make sense; blurred vision; or a blank stare. Medium doses can cause confusion, agitation, analgesia (not feeling pain), fever, excessive salivation, and \"schizophrenic-type\" behavior. High doses can cause seizures, respiratory failure (where the breathing systems in the body stop working), coma, fever, stroke, or death.\nAddiction.\nPeople who use PCP can get physically or psychologically (mentally) addicted to the drug. If an addicted person suddenly stops taking PCP, he will get withdrawal symptoms, like diarrhea, chills, and tremors (uncontrollable shaking in part of the body). In the brain, PCP affects multiple neurotransmitter systems. (Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the brain.) For example, it keeps the brain from getting rid of extra dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. These are all very important neurotransmitters in the brain. PCP can also affect some types of opioid receptors in the brain. It also inhibits (or blocks) the action of glutamate by blocking NMDA (N-methyl d-aspartate) receptors. Prescription drugs like diazepam (Valium), haloperidol (Haldol), and phentolamine may be used to help manage some of PCP's effects."}

In return, sharks do not eat pilot fish because pilot fish eat their parasites. This is called a \"mutualist\" relationship. Small pilot fish are often seen swimming into the mouth of a shark to eat small pieces of food from the shark's teeth. Sailors even said that sharks and pilot fish act like close friends. When a ship captured \"their\" shark, the pilot fish followed the ship. Some people reported that the pilot fish would follow the ship for up to six weeks.

His father, found that Floyd had been going out at night and often followed him at a distance to make sure he was not getting into trouble. Today, Floyd Landis's father is a supporter of his son and says he is one of Floyd's biggest fans.\n2006 Tour de France.\nBefore the 2006 Tour de Francemost people thought the winner would be either Ivan Basso or Jan Ullrich, who finished second and third respectively in the 2005 tour. Days before the race, the Operaci\u00f3n Puerto doping case forced Basso and Ullrich to withdraw, and Landis became one of the favourites to win\nHip ailment.\nLandis performance up to Stage 16 of the Tour de France and his comeback in Stage 17 is surprising because of his hip ailment, called osteonecrosis, which was revealed in an article in \"The New York Times\" during the 2006 Tour de France. This means he was in constant pain.\nDoping investigation.\nOn July 27, 2006 the Phonak Cycling Team said Floyd Landis had a urine test come back positive, having an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone epitestosterone (T/E ratio) after Stage 17. Landis denied having doped. Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive. It did, and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team. Landis's personal physician later disclosed that the test had found a T/E ratio of 11:1 in Landis, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1.\nThe tests were done by French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD)which is part of the Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life, and is and is accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).)\nAppeal.\nOn May 14, 2007 a meeting began between the USADA and Landis about the doping allegations. On September 20, 2007, the arbitrators found Landis guilty of doping.\nAs Landis forfeited his Tour title, the second place rider, \u00d3scar Pereiro, became the race's official winner. Landis has also been banned from the sport for two years, dated retroactively to January 2007.\nLandis's former team, Phonak has already been disbanded\nThe USADA had more B samples taken during the Tour de France 2006 examined. After Landis's attempts to prevent these tests had failed, traces of exogenous testosterone were found in several samples in a test of seven samples. These confirmation tests were done at the same French lab Landis's team was trying to discredit for the first positive results.\nLandis did race in France in 2007 so that the appeal could be decided in the United States first. If the raced in France they may start their own investigation because doping is illegal in France.\nAmong Landis's lawyers are Jos\u00e9 Maria Buxeda of Spain and Howard L. Jacobs of the United States. Buxeda represented Roberto Heras when he was suspended for two years after testing positive for doping. Jacobs has also defended athletes accused of doping, such as cyclist Tyler Hamilton and sprinter Tim Montgomery. They are also representing Kazakh cyclist Alexandre Vinokourov who was accused of blood doping, kicked out of the 2007 Tour de France, and fired from his cycling team.\nVerdict.\nOn September 20, 2007 Landis was found guilty of doping by a 2-1 vote of the hearing committee. The committee said that there were mistakes testing the sample so they will not say that there was a high amount of the natural chemical testosterone. But the committee did say was proof of artificial testosterone and that \nLandis does have the right to appeal the decision of the committee to the Court of Arbitration for Sport."}

It has the most pointed beak among sea turtles, which is how it gets its name. The hawksbill gets food from inside coral reefs, eating sponges, shrimp, squid, and other invertebrates. The hawksbill pointy beak helps the turtle get food out of the tiny cracks and holes in which it searches.\nThough they are sometimes seen in American waters, hawksbill turtles almost always nest in the warmer climates that run along the equator.

It looks at the way words are put together using small pieces called morphemes. A morpheme is the smallest part of a word that has meaning. Different languages have different morphemes and have different rules for how morphemes are combined.\nFree and bound morphemes.\nWords are the smallest pieces of a sentence. Some words only have one morpheme. For example the English words \"thank,\" \"dog,\" and \"slow\" are all words made up of only one morpheme. A morpheme that can stand alone as a word is called a \"free morpheme\".\nWords can also be made up of more than one morpheme. English speakers know that one can add the plural(more than one) morpheme, \"-s,\" to the end of \"dog,\" and create the word \"dogs\". The new word combines the meanings of the two morphemes, so the meaning of the new word, \"dogs\" is \"more than one dog.\" \"Dog\" is a free morpheme, but the plural morpheme \"-s\" is not. It must attach to a word (no native English speaker would use \"-s\" as a stand alone word). Morphemes which must be attached to a word are called \"bound morphemes\". Morphemes attached to the front of a word are called \"prefixes\". Those attached to the end are called \"suffixes\". Some morphemes can attach in the middle of a word and are called \"infixes\". (example?)\nInflectional and derivational morphemes.\nThere are two types of bound morphemes: derivational and inflectional. Inflectional morphemes give a listener or reader information about how the word is used in a sentence. English does not have a lot of inflectional morphemes. An example of an inflectional morpheme in English is the \"-ed\" suffix for verbs. This morpheme at the end of a verb lets the speaker know that the action happened in the past. Another example is the \"-s\" suffix for nouns to show that there is more than one of the noun.\nDerivational morphemes change the part of speech or somehow change the basic meaning of the word they attach to. Most bound morphemes in English are derivational.\nExamples.\n\"English Word: \"unthankful\"\"\nMorphemes:\n\"English Word: \"songwriter\"\"\nMorphemes:\n\"English Word: \"modernized\"\"\nMorphemes:"}

Their existence, from 4000 or earlier, is implied by their language. They were the speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), an unwritten but now partly reconstructed prehistoric language.\nPeople.\nKnowledge of them comes not only from language, but also from archaeology and archaeo-genetics. They were a group of loosely related peoples ancestral to the Bronze Age Indo-Europeans.\nThe Proto-Indo-Europeans likely lived during the Copper Age, or roughly the 5th to 4th millennia BC. Mainstream scholarship places them in the general region of the steppes in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Some scholars would extend the time of PIE much further back. More recent studies support an origin in today's northern Iran and the Armenian Highland.\nBy the mid-2nd millennium BC offshoots of the Proto-Indo-Europeans had reached Anatolia, the Aegean, Indus Valley, Ganges Plain, and likely Western Europe.\nCulture.\nThe Proto-Indo-European culture had some or all of these features:\nThe Proto-Indo-Europeans were a patrilineal society, probably half-nomadic, relying on animal husbandry, notably of cattle and sheep. They domesticated the horse \u2013 \"ekwos\" (cf. Latin \"equus\"). The cow (\"gwous\") played a central role, in religion and mythology as well as in daily life. A man's wealth would have been measured by the number of his animals (small livestock), \"pe\u1e31us\" (cf. English \"fee\", Latin \"pecunia\").\nThey practiced a polytheistic religion centered on sacrificial rites, probably administered by a priestly caste. Burials in barrows or tomb chambers (see Kurgan hypothesis). Important leaders would have been buried with their belongings, and possibly also with members of their households or wives (human sacrifice, suttee).\nMany Indo-European societies know a threefold division of priests, a warrior class, and a class of peasants or husbandmen. If there was a separate class of warriors, it probably consisted of single young men. They would have followed a separate warrior code unacceptable in the society outside their peer-group. Traces of initiation rites in several Indo-European societies suggest that this group identified itself with wolves or dogs (see also Berserker, werewolf).\nAs for technology, reconstruction suggests a culture of the early Bronze Age, with bronze tools and weapons. Silver and gold were known. Sheep were kept for wool, and textiles were woven. The wheel was known, certainly for ox-drawn carts, and late Proto-Indo European warfare may also have made use of horse-drawn chariots.\nThe native name of this people cannot be reconstructed with certainty. \"Aryo-\" (interpreted by some as meaning \"those who plow\"), sometimes upheld as a self-identification of the Proto-Indo-Europeans (see Aryan), is shown only in the Indo-Iranian subfamily, since it appears on written inscriptions; however, the Proto-Indo-Europeans themselves had not yet adopted writing, so there is no way to verify that \"Aryo-\" was their self-identification."}

It was signed on December 7, 1970 and ratified by the German Bundestag on May 17, 1972.\nIn the treaty, both sides committed themselves to nonviolence and accepted the existing border - the Oder-Neisse line. This was a very sensitive topic at the time as Poland was concerned that one day a German government would lay claim to some of the territory Germany lost after World War II. Poland took over this territory to replace eastern Poland, which the Soviet Union had conquered in 1939. A lot of that land was east of the Curzon Line, and Poland kept it after the Polish-Soviet War (1919-1921).\nChancellor Willy Brandt was heavily criticized by the conservative CDU/CSU opposition, which indeed were in favour of such a claim, accusing him of abandoning German interests. The Oder-Neisse line was reaffirmed by a reunited Germany in the German-Polish Border Treaty, signed on 14 November 1990.\nIn the FRG at the time this treaty was signed it was not seen as the last word on the border, because article IV stated that previous treaties like the Potsdam Agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement, so the provisions of this treaty could be changed by a final peace treaty between Germany and the Allies of World War II as provided for in the Potsdam Agreement."}
{"id": "72332", "revid": "1011913", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72332", "title": "History of Poland", "text": "The History of Poland is the history of rather different territories during the past millennium. At one time, in the 16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the second largest state in Europe, after Russia. At other times there was no separate Polish state at all. Poland got back its independence in 1918, after more than a century of rule by nearby empires, but its borders shifted again after the Second World War.\nFormation and early history.\nPoland began to form into a country around the middle of the 10th century in the Piast dynasty. In 966, Prince Mieszko I got himself and the whole Polish nation christened. \nIn the 12th century Poland broke into some smaller states, which were later attacked by Mongol armies in 1241. In 1320 W\u0142adys\u0142aw I became the King of the repaired Poland. His son Casimir III repaired the Polish economy, built new castles and won the war against the Ruthenian dukedom.\nThe Black Death, which affected many parts of Europe from 1347 to 1351, did not come to Poland.\nBeginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila, the Jagiellon dynasty (1385\u20131569) formed the Polish-Lithuanian Union. The partnership proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians, who played a dominant role in one of the most powerful empires in Europe for the next three centuries. The \"Nihil novi\" act adopted by the Polish Sejm (parliament) in 1505, transferred most of the legislative power from the Monarch to the Sejm. This event marked the beginning of the period known as \"Nobility Commonwealth\" when the State was ruled by the \"free and equal\" Polish nobility. The Lublin Union of 1569, established the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as an influential player in European politics and a vital cultural entity.\nConflict with neighbors.\nIn the 17th century Sweden attacked all of Poland (this was called \u201cthe Deluge\u201d). Many wars against the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Cossacks, Transylvania and Brandenburg-Prussia ended with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. During the following 80 years, the government and natione were weaker, making Poland dependent on Russia. Russian tsars took advantage of this by offering money to traitors, who would block new ideas and solutions. Russia, Prussia, and Austria broke Poland into three pieces in 1772, 1793 and 1795, which dissolved the country. Polish people did not like the new kings, and often rebelled.\nConstitutional state.\nIn 1791, in an attempt of reform the Sejm of Poland and Lithuania accepted the Constitution of May 3 which was the first modern constitution in Europe and the second (after the United States) on Earth. But that did not help against the partitions of Poland in 1793 and 1795. \nPost-Napoleonic period.\nNapoleon made another Polish state, \u201cthe Duchy of Warsaw\u201d. After the Napoleonic wars, Prussia, Russia, and Austria again split Poland among themselves at the Congress of Vienna. The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar. \nWorld War II.\n\"See also: Polish victims of The Holocaust\"\nDuring World War I all Western Allies agreed to save Poland. Soon after the surrender of Germany in November 1918, Poland became the Second Polish Republic (\"II Rzeczpospolita Polska\"). It got its freedom after several military conflicts; the largest was in 1919-1921 Polish-Soviet War.\nOn September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany attacked Poland, and the Soviet Union attacked on September 17. Warsaw was defeated on September 28, and was split up into two pieces, one owned by Nazi Germany, the other by the Soviet Union. The eastern part of the German zone was turned into the German Government area.\nOut of all the countries that were in the war, Poland lost the highest amount of its people: over 6 million died, half of them Polish Jews. Poland also gave the most troops, after the US, the British and the Soviets, to ultimately defeat Nazi Germany. At the war's end, Poland's borders were moved west, pushing the east border to the Curzon line. The west border was moved to the Oder-Neisse line. The new Poland became 20% smaller by 77,500 square kilometeres (29,900 sq mi). The shift forced millions of people to move: Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews.\nAfter these events, Poland became, for the first time, a real country. There are still many Polish in the neighboring countries Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, as well as in other countries. The most Poles outside of Poland are in the United States, especially in Chicago.\nSoviet era.\nAfter the Second World War, the Soviet Union put a Communist government in Poland, and the country was named the People's Republic of Poland. In 1989 Solidarity - a political group led by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa - helped defeat the communist government in Poland.\nPost-communist and the EU.\nDuring the early 1990s the country turned its economy into one of the most solid in Central Europe. There were many improvements in human rights, such as free speech, democracy, etc. In 1991 Poland became a member of the Visegrad Group and joined NATO in 1999 also with the Czech Republic and Hungary. Polish voters then voted to join the European Union in a vote in June 2003. The country joined the EU on May 1, 2004."}

In many cases a princess who is already married to a king becomes pregnant, and their child inherits the crown of both countries. However, a personal union sometimes was seen as a means against uprisings if a state wants an annexation of an other state. The unions can be written down in a constitution, which clearly expresses that both states shall share the same person as head of state. When that is not the case, a personal union can easily be broken.\nSome examples.\nBelgium.\nPersonal union with the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908, when it annexed the Congo Free State. \nCongo Free State.\nPersonal union with Belgium from 1885 to 1908, when Belgium annexed it. \nEngland.\nThe actual situation was slightly more complex with the Dutch provinces Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel entering into personal union in 1689 and Drenthe in 1696.

{"id": "72346", "revid": "4357583", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72346", "title": "Scordatura", "text": "Scordatura in music is a technique in which players of string instruments tune their strings to different notes from a normal tuning. The word \u201cscordatura\u201d is an Italian word which means \u201cmistuning\u201d. It was used for lutes, guitars, viols and instruments of the violin family.\nUsing a scordatura tuning made the instrument sound different. For example: a string tuned to a slightly higher note will sound louder and brighter because it is tighter. Care has to be taken not to tune it too high otherwise it will break. Scordatura also made it possible to play unusual chords or combinations of notes in string-crossing (when the bow moves quickly from one string to another).\nWhen a composer writes for an instrument using scordatura tuning he shows at the beginning of the music what notes the strings must be tuned to. The music is then written, not as it sounds, but so that the player can read it as if the instrument were being played normally, e.g. if a G string is tuned up to G# and the composer wants a G# he simply writes a G, but it will sound G#.\nScordatura in the Baroque period.\nScordatura tuning was mainly popular in the Baroque period from 1600-1750. Composers such as Heinrich Biber often used it. He composed a group of sonatas for violin and accompaniment called the \"Rosary Sonatas\". In each sonata the violin is tuned in a different way. In Sonata XI (called \"Resurrection\") he even asks the violinist to make the two middle strings cross over between the bridge and the tailpiece so that the violin is tuned to two Gs and two Ds.\nScordatura in the Classical Period.\nIn the classical period a famous example of scordatura is Mozart\u2019s, \"Sinfonia Concertante\" for Violin, Viola and Orchestra in which he asks the viola to tune all four strings a semitone higher than usual. This makes it sound louder and brighter so that it matches the brightness of the violin, especially as the violin is playing with normal tuning in the key of E flat, which sounds a soft key (because the key of Eflat hardly uses any \u201copen\u201d strings).\nLater examples.\nIn the late 19th century and 20th century there are examples of composers using scordatura. In his Fourth Symphony Mahler asks the violin soloist (the leader of the orchestra) to play on a violin tuned to Gsharp-D-A-Eflat. The music is describing a poor beggar playing a violin. The violin soloist needs a second instrument for this, so that he can swap quickly back to a normal violin.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns asks the solo violin in \"Danse Macabre\" to tune the E string to Eflat to make it sound like the devil.\nZolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly wrote a sonata in B minor for solo cello, for which the cellist has to tune down the two lower strings to F# and B instead of G and C. This helps to make a very dark, rich sound when playing B minor chords."}

A migration from the Aegean sea, as claimed by a couple of Greek historians: Herodotus, who described them as a group of immigrants from Lydia in Anatolia, and Hellanicus of Lesbos who claimed that the Tyrrhenians were the Pelasgians originally from Thessaly, Greece The third hypotheses is reported by Livy and Pliny the Elder, the Etruscans as related to Rhaetian people to the north and other populations living in the Alps.\nGerman linguist Helmut Rix proposed the Tyrsenian language family, with Etruscan related to the Rhaetic language spoken in the Alps north of Etruria, and to the Lemnian language spoken in Lemons. In particular the Lemnian language could have arrived in the Aegean Sea during the Late Bronze Age, when Mycenaean rulers recruited groups of mercenaries from Sicily, Sardinia and various parts of the Italian peninsula.\nThe latest mtDNA study (2013) suggests that the Etruscans appear to fall very close to a Neolithic population from Central Europe and to other Tuscan populations."}

It is considered a type of renewable energy, since it all comes from living plants and animals. It can be used to power an engine, usually for vehicles, including airplanes. It replaces diesel that comes from petroleum, a type of fossil fuel. \nBiofuel prepared from biomass is different since it does not start from oil and uses a different chemical process to make the fuel.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nBiodiesel is much cleaner and has less pollution than diesel fuel made from fossil fuels. It also acts as a solvent (like soap). In fact, it cleans the engine so much that it might pull out old dirt in the engine and clog up the filters. After the filters are replaced then it is fine.\nIn the United States and several other places, new laws say that regular diesel fuel must be low in sulfur. This gets rid of pollution, especially acid rain, but it also makes the fuel less slippery. Adding in biodiesel helps keep the fuel slippery and the engine running smoothly. \nMost biodiesel comes from plants. This means a lot of farmland is used to grow plants for fuel instead of for feeding animals and people. There are scientists, chemical engineers and agricultural engineers who are studying ways to use algae and saltwater plants to make oil. This would not take away farmland that is used to grow food. Also, some biodiesel comes from waste oil and waste animal fat, that would otherwise be thrown away. NASA is testing biodiesel made from chicken fat to fuel their airplanes. \nAll diesel fuel has a problem starting an engine in cold weather, but biodiesel has more of a problem. This can be solved by mixing biodiesel and regular diesel at the right mixture. Or by heating the fuel before it is used by the engine. There might be a heater built into the vehicle for this.\nBiodiesel from plants.\nMost biodiesel is made from oilseed. Oilseed is any type of seed that has enough oil in it to be useful in making vegetable oil. \nIn Brazil, castor beans are the best plants to make biodiesel.\nIn Germany biodiesel is usually made from rapeseeds.\nSoybeans and sunflower seeds are commonly used in the United States.\nIn Thailand, the raw material will most likely come from palm oil, coconut oil, Jatropha oil, and animal fat.\nJatropha trees also grow in India and Africa.\nSome people make their own biodiesel by converting old oil that is used in restaurants to fry foods. The exhaust smells a bit like french fries. \nBiodiesel from algae.\nSomeday algae might be used to make more biodiesel than is made today with vegetable oil. Algae can be grown in places that food cannot be grown in, so it would not take food away from people. But right now it is still too expensive, but scientists are looking at ways to make the process better. "}

There is also a spinoff game called \"Age of Mythology\". It is similar to \"Age of Empires\", but players can also control monsters like the cyclops. After Ensemble Studios had closed down, another game called \"Age of Empires Online\" was made. It is \"free to play\", which means that you do not have to pay money to play the game, but you can buy things in the game if you want to.\n\"Age of Empires I\" (2018) and \"Age of Empires II\" (2019), twenty years later, come in \"Definitive Editions\" with better graphics et cetera. \"Definitive Edition\" of \"Age of Empires III\" is in development.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Age of Empires\", the player usually guides a small tribe of people to build a city. The people, called villagers, can hunt deer, collect berries, and farm for food. They can chop trees for wood. They can collect gold and stone at mines in the ground. The villagers build buildings to make a large city.\nThere are enemy cities that the player must destroy. When the player has enough food, wood, gold, and stone, the player can train soldiers to fight the enemy. At the beginning of the game, the player only gets weak soldiers, but the player can get better and better units as time goes on.\nEach game takes place over four or five time periods called ages. Each players starts in the first age and wants to get to the last age. Each game has a different set of ages:\nWhen a player has enough food and gold to advance to the next age, the player must wait. After about a minute, the city reaches the next age. The player's buildings look different and the player can do new things to improve his town and soldiers. New, powerful soldiers such as archers (people that shoot with a bow and arrow), cavalry (warriors that ride horses), catapults (machines that throw stones), artillery (big guns that shoot cannon balls) can be used. The player can build walls and towers to defend the city. The player can even build many different Wonders that give different effects.\nAll of the \"Age of Empires\" games are usually good because the game makes sure no type of soldier is too powerful. There is always a way to kill a large group of enemy units. For example, if a group of twenty archers is attacking, the player should fight back with cavalry or artillery. Many people call this balance, because it is impossible for one unit to get too powerful.\nThe \"Age of Empires\" games have many different groups of people to choose from. Each group has a different set of soldiers and abilities. \nThere are four common ways to play \"Age of Empires\":\n\"Age of Empires\" can be played alone (against computer players) or online against human players. \"Age of Empires\" can be played online using official multiplayer platforms or programs like GameRanger and Voobly."}

It sends the vibrations of the strings to the main part of the instrument so that the sound can be heard.\nThe bridge of an instrument in the violin family (violin, viola, cello and double bass) can be seen very clearly. It is a piece of hardwood which is shaped like a bridge. The top is like an arch in shape because the player needs to be able to play on one string at a time. The feet of the bridge have to be shaped to fit on the front of the instrument (the \u201cbelly\u201d) which is curved. The bridge is not fixed to the instrument: it is only held up because of the tension (tightness) of the strings. The soundpost, a small wooden column inside the body, is also held up by tension of the strings and the bridge.\nThe part of the string which vibrates and gives the note is the part between the bridge and the top of the fingerboard (or the part between the bridge and where the player puts his finger). The other end of the string is fixed to a tailpiece.\nOn a banjo the bridge works in the same way, but on a guitar the bridge is fixed to the instrument and the strings are fixed to the bridge.\nThere are even instruments with moveable bridges such as the Japanese koto which has a separate bridge for each string."}

The wood also gives a red dye called brazilin.\nThere are several trees in this family which have very similar properties, including the development of red dye. The term \"brazilwood\" is sometimes used for these other species as well.

It was rule by the Norse for 400 years, then dominated by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century caused a decline in the population from over 20,000 to around 9,200 in the early 21st century. The population has risen 4% from the census of 1991. The main industries are tourism, agriculture, fishing and whisky-distilling.\nSkye is part of the Highland Council local government area and is now linked to the mainland by a road bridge. The island is renowned for its spectacular scenery, vibrant culture and heritage, and its abundant wildlife, including the Golden Eagle, Red Deer and Atlantic Salmon.\nThe Clans.\nSkye has a rich heritage of ancient monuments from the clans, especially castles. Dunvegan Castle has been the seat of Clan MacLeod since the 13th century.

Together with the families Amati and Stradivari they made some of the best violins the world has known. \nAndrea Guarneri (c. 1626 - 7 December 1698) was a pupil in the workshop of Nicolo Amati from 1641 to 1646 and returned to make violins for Amati from 1650 to 1654. He married a rich lady and they were able to buy a large house which became known as the \u201cCasa Guarneri\u201d. They had seven children. Two of his sons: Pietro Giovanni and Giuseppe Giovanni, became violin makers. Andrea Guarneri produced some fine violas, one of which was played by William Primrose in the early 20th century.\nPietro Giovanni Guarneri (18 February 1655 - 26 March 1720), known as Peter of Mantua (\"Pietro da Mantova\") to distinguish him from his nephew Pietro Guarneri. He worked in his father's workshop from around 1670 until his marriage in 1677. He had settled in Mantua by 1683, where he worked both as a musician and a violin maker. His instruments are generally better than his father's. However, he did not make so many instruments because he spent a lot of his time playing them. None of his children became violin makers. Joseph Szigeti played one of his instruments.\nAndrea's younger son, Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri (25 November 1666 - 1739 or 1740), known as \"filius Andreae\", joined his father's business in Cremona. He inherited it in 1698. He is one of the great violin makers.\nGiuseppe Giovanni Battista was father to two other instrument makers: Pietro Guerneri who settled in Venice and Bartolomeo.\nPietro Guarneri (Peter of Venice or \"Pietro da Venezia\") (14 April 1695 - 7 April, 1762) made some instruments that are as great as those of his father. One of his cellos was played by Beatrice Harrison. \nBartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri (\"del Ges\u00f9\"), also known as Joseph (21 August 1698 - 17 October 1744), has been called the finest violin maker of the Amati line (Amati and his pupils). Giuseppe is known as \"del Ges\u00f9\" because his labels always have the characters I.H.S. (\"iota-eta-sigma\") and a Roman cross. His instruments are different from the others made by his family. They are thought of as the greatest violins with the exception of those by Stradivari. The famous violin virtuoso Niccol\u00f2 Paganini\u2019s favorite instrument was a Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violin of 1743. The \"Lord Wilton\" Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violin made in 1742 was owned by Yehudi Menuhin and other Twentieth-century 'del Ges\u00f9' players have included, Arthur Grumiaux, Jascha Heifetz, Isaac Stern and Henryk Szeryng."}

He can be thought of as the inventor of the violin in its modern form. He made violins, violas and cellos. A small number of his instruments are still in existence. They are dated between 1564 and 1574 and they have the coat of arms of Charles IX of France on the back.\nHis sons Antonio and Girolamo Amati.\nAndrea Amati\u2019s two sons were Antonio Amati who was born about 1540 in Cremona and died there on 14 February 1607 and Girolamo Amati who was born about 1561 in Cremona and died of the plague there on 21 October 1630. They are known as \"The Brothers Amati\", but they did not work much together. However, they both produced some great instruments. They made the shape of the f holes perfect and gave their instruments more strength. They also made some large violas and cellos. They had an enormous influence on all other violin makers.\nNicol\u00f2 Amati.\nNicol\u00f2 Amati was the son of Girolamo Amati. He is now the most famous member of the family. He was born on 3 December 1596 and died on 12 April 1684) He was the most eminent of the family. He had become a very skilled violin maker by 1630 when his father died. During the next few years there was a lot of suffering because of the plague and not many people could afford to buy instruments. Then, after 1640, there was more demand again and Nicol\u00f2 made many great instruments. Those that have survived are among the most sought-after and expensive violins today. He made instruments that were slightly wider and were known as the \u201cGrand Pattern\u201d. Many other violin makers learned from him. These pupils include Andrea Guarneri and possibly also Antonio Stradivari.\nGirolamo Amati.\nThe last maker of the family was Nicolo's son, Girolamo Amati, known as Hieronymus II. He was born on 26 February and died on 21 February, 1740. Although he made some improvements to his father's instruments, they are not as good. Antonio Stradivari became the greatest violin maker at this time."}

{"id": "72590", "revid": "116088", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72590", "title": "Musical tuning", "text": "In music tuning an instrument means getting it ready so that when it is played it will sound at the correct pitch: not too high or too low.\nWhen two or more instruments play together it is particularly important that they are in tune with one another. This means that when they play the same note it is indeed exactly the same note. If the two instruments are not in tune with one another it will sound unpleasant because two notes which are very slightly different in pitch will produce a \u201cbeat\u201d.\nTuning instruments.\nInstruments such as the piano or organ have to be tuned by people who are specialists in tuning. For most instruments, however, the players themselves need to tune their instruments before they play. Players of string instruments can turn the pegs at the top of their instruments to change the tension (tightness) of the string. Players of wind instruments can make their instruments very slightly longer or shorter by pushing out or pulling in one of the joints. Timpanists turn the taps which are around the top of their instruments to change the tension of the drum head.\nWhen an orchestra gives a concert the instruments have to tune carefully so that they are in tune with one another. Usually it is the principal oboist\u2019s job to stand up and play the note A so that everyone can tune to that note. In some countries such as the US it is tradition for the principal violinist (concertmaster) to give the A. If the orchestra are going to play with a piano soloist they will have to tune to the A of the piano because the piano has already been tuned by the piano tuner.\nWhen a violinist tunes his instrument he is making sure that his four strings are tuned perfectly to G, D, A and E. Each string is wound around a peg near the top of the scroll, so that turning the peg changes the tuning. He may also have \u201cadjusters\u201d or \u201cfine tuners\u201d which are at the other end of the string where it is attached to the tailpiece. The adjusters make it easier to make small changes to the tuning. The violinist will make sure that the A is in tune, then the A and D can be played together so that they are exactly a fifth apart, then the D and G and finally the A and E are compared.\nIf they are not tuning to a piano, players of instruments sometimes use a tuning fork which gives an exact note (usually an A) so that they know they are in tune. There are also electronic tuning devices.\nTuning systems.\nWhen an instrument such as the piano is tuned, the piano tuner has to know how to make each note relate correctly to the others. During the course of music history there have been several systems of doing this. These different \"tuning systems\" are all about the exact scientific relationship between the notes of the scale. There has been an enormous amount of discussion among musicians about how best to tune instruments.\nComma of Pythagoras.\nWhen two notes are an octave apart the higher note is vibrating at twice the speed of the lower note. For example: if a string is vibrating at 440\u00a0Hz (440 times a second) the note we hear is an A (the A above Middle C on the piano). If the string is stopped halfway up (e.g. because the player presses it down with a finger) it will vibrate at 880\u00a0Hz and we will hear the note one octave higher.\nThe note which vibrates at 1 \u00bd times the frequency of the basic note will be the note a perfect fifth higher (an E).\nIf a piano tuner starts by tuning a C, then tunes a G so that it is exactly 1 \u00bd times the frequency of the C, he can continue tuning in fifths (a D, then an A etc.) until he arrives back at C again. However, he will find that, for mathematical reasons, the last C is not in tune with the first C. This was discovered long ago by Pythagoras and is called \u201cthe comma of Pythagoras\u201d.\nSolutions to the comma of Pythagoras.\nMusical tuning systems throughout the centuries have tried to find ways of dealing with this problem. From the 16th century onwards several music theorists wrote long books about the best way to tune keyboard instruments. They often started by tuning up a fifth and down a fifth so that these notes were perfectly in tune (e.g. C, G and F), then they would continue (tuning the D to the G and B flat to the F) until they met in the middle around F sharp. Sometimes old organs today are tuned by such a method. Playing in keys with very few sharps or flats (such as C, G or F) sounds very beautiful, but playing in keys with lots of sharps or flats sounds horribly out of tune.\nIn 1584, Zhu Zaiyu, a prince of Chinese Ming Dynasty, published the invention of equal temperament in his book \"A New Account of the Science of the Pitch-Pipes.\" In 1585 Simon Stevin invented a similar system. Some scholars think one of these really invented this system. Others think both did, or neither.\nAround 1700, based on this new system, the great composer Johann Sebastian Bach wrote two books of 24 preludes and fugues (called the \"Well-tempered Clavier)\" to prove that it was now possible to play in any key.\nSystems for the twelve-note chromatic scale.\nHere are some of the main ways of tuning the twelve-note chromatic scale which have been developed in order to get round the problem that an instrument cannot be tuned so that all intervals are \"perfect\":"}

In 1863, aged 14, he was sent to prison for 14 days for stealing. He was expelled from school. \nVoigt\u2019s father taught him how to make shoes. However, Voigt continued to steal and forge and was often sent to prison. Eventually he was let out of prison in 1906.\nVoigt travelled around until he went to live with his sister who lived near Berlin. He worked briefly as a court shoemaker until, on August 24, 1906, police expelled him from Berlin as an \u201cundesirable\u201d (someone who is not wanted). Although he was supposed to have gone to Hamburg he stayed in Berlin. He could not get a job because he was an unregistered citizen, but he could not register to live in Berlin because he had no job.\nCaptain of K\u00f6penick.\nOn October 16 1906 Voigt was ready for the big adventure that made him famous. He had bought parts of a captain's uniform from different shops. He had resigned from the shoe factory ten days before. He put on the captain\u2019s uniform and went to the local army barracks, stopped four grenadiers and a sergeant on their way back to barracks and told them to come with him. \nThese soldiers had been taught to obey officers without asking any questions, so they did what they were told. He told the commanding sergeant to report to his boss, and told 6 more soldiers to come with him. Then he took a train with the soldiers to K\u00f6penick, east of Berlin, occupied the local city hall and told the soldiers to guard all the exits. \nHe told the local Police to go and look for people breaking the law, and told the local Post Office not to let anyone make telephone calls to Berlin for an hour (this was in the early days of the telephone when people could not dial numbers automatically: they had to ask the Post Office to make the connection).\nHe arrested the town secretary and the mayor, saying that they had been taking money from the town hall, and he took a large amount of money: 4002 marks and 37 pfennigs, signing a receipt for it, but using the name of the governor of the jail where he had been. \nThen he stopped two carriages and told the grenadiers to use them to take the mayor and the treasurer to the police so that they could be questioned. He told the remaining guards to stand in their places for half an hour. Then he went to the train station. Later he changed back into ordinary clothes and disappeared.\nHis capture.\nDuring the next few days the newspapers around the world reported what had happened. Everybody seemed to think it was a very amusing joke.\nVoigt was arrested on October 26 and on December 1 he was sentenced to four years in prison for forgery, impersonating (pretending to be) an officer and wrongful imprisonment. However, so many people seemed to have sympathy with Voigt. Even the Emperor Wilhelm II was probably amused by it and he pardoned him on August 16, 1908.\nIn England everybody thought the whole story was funny. The English people thought it showed that the stereotype (idea) they had about Germans was right, i.e. that they were taught to obey orders and not to think.\nVoigt\u2019s last years..\nAfter Voigt had been pardoned and let out of jail he spent his remaining years travelling to many countries including United States and Canada where he told people about his great adventure. He appeared in small theatres and signed lots of photographs. A waxwork was made of him in Madame Tussaud's museum in London.\nIn 1910, he moved to Luxembourg and worked as a waiter and shoemaker. Two years later, he bought a house and retired, but the inflation after World War I made him poor. Voigt died in Luxembourg.\nMany plays and movies were written about him, including a play by the German author Carl Zuckmayer called \"Der Hauptmann von K\u00f6penick\" (The Captain of K\u00f6penick), Several movies were produced about the affair, including an English language adaptation by John Mortimer (1971)."}

They established a kingdom centered at Hattusha in north-central Anatolia from the 18th century BC.\nAt its peak, the Hittite Empire covered most of modern Turkey and Syria. This was under the reigns of Suppiluliuma I (~1350\u20131322) and Mursili II (~1321\u20131295 BC). They had up-and-down relationships with Ancient Egypt to the south, and the Assyrian Empire in Mesopotamia. They were a party to the first known peace treaty, which was made with Ramesses II of Egypt by Hattusili III in 1258 BC.\nAfter 1180 BC, the empire disintegrated into several independent \"Neo-Hittite\" city-states, some surviving until as late as the 8th century BC.\nEmpire of Suppiluliuma and Mursili II.\nThe Hittite Kingdom reached its zenith during the reign of Suppiluliuma I (~1350\u20131322). The kingdom of Mitanni, wracked by civil war, was unable to withstand the Hittite onslaught. Suppiluliuma swiftly attacked the Mitanni heartland, capturing and plundering the Mitanni capital of Washshuganni. He then turned west, recrossed the Euphrates and captured all the Syrian kingdoms which were vassals to the Mitanni, including Aleppo, Mukish, Niya, Qatna, Upi (Upina), and Kadesh. Other kingdoms such as Ugarit and Amurru (an Egyptian vassal) voluntarily became vassal states of the Hittites. \nWhen hostilities flared up once more with Mitanni, Tulipinu, Suppiluliuma's son and viceroy at Aleppo invaded Carchemish but was unable to take the city. Suppiluliuma met with his son and then invaded Syria himself, laying siege to the city of Carchemish. Suppiluliuma broke the siege on the eighth day, installing his son Piyassili as viceroy of the kingdom. With his sons as viceroys of Aleppo and Carchemish, Suppiluliuma had cemented his rule over Syria and brought the empire of Mitanni to an end. The Mitanni King was assassinated soon after.\nThe murdered prince.\nWhen Tutankhamun, the Egyptian Pharaoh died,his widow asked to marry one of Suppiluliuma's sons. He agreed, and sent his son Zannanza to Egypt to marry the queen. However, Zannanza was assassinated en route to Egypt. Suppiluliuma was furious and blamed the new Egyptian Pharaoh Ay for his son's death. A Hittite army under crown prince Arnuwanda invaded Egyptian territory from Syria, pillaging and taking many prisoners. These prisoners brought with them a plague which ravaged the Hittite Kingdom continuing well into Mursili's reign and may have killed Suppiluliuma himself.\nMursili II.\nMursili II was young and inexperienced, but he proved to be a strong king. In the first years of his reign he carried out punitive campaigns against several kingdoms. In Syria the Nuhashshi king Tette rebelled and was joined by Egyptian troops. Troubles in Syria continued when Mursili's brothers Tulipinu and Piyassili both died. The loss of his Syrian viceroys led to rebellion and even the invasion of Carchemish by Assyria. Leaving his generals to deal with Syria and Haysa, Mursili invaded Carchemish and drove out the Assyrians. Later in his reign Mursili II campaigned against the Kaska once again retaking the Hittite holy city of Niniveh. He also decisively defeating the King of Tummanna."}

It affects the brain and gets worse over time. This can lead to problems with moving, memory loss as well as thinking skills. Lastly, it also causes changes in behavior. Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease. On average, the disease leads to death about fifteen years after the first signs of the illness show. It is found in about 6 in 100,000 people. There is a 50% chance of inheriting this disease from the parents.\nHistory.\nThe disease is named after George Huntington. George Huntington specialized in medicine and psychology. In 1872, he was the first to describe the medical condition he was seeing in patients in a paper about science. In an 1908 review, an important scientist who also focused on medicine and psychology, William Osler, said about the paper: \"In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described.\"\nAccording to Huntington, the disease is characterized by three things: it is inherited; people who have it become cases for psychiatry (insanity and people who kill themselves); and it only occurs in adults. That was the medical understanding at that time. Of these, the last one is wrong: some children also show signs of the disease.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of Huntington's disease usually begin between the ages of 35 and 44\u00a0years. They can, however, start in any age group from babies to old age. Also, Huntington's disease kills the cells in the body and brain.\nIn fact, children with Huntington's disease are often much sicker. They get worse faster. Instead of having chorea, they usually have rigidity (or stiffness) of their muscles and it is painful. Seizures (uncontrollable movements in the body) are also a common sign in children.\nTreatment and care.\nIn 2015, there is still no treatment for the disease itself. There are medicines available to help with some of the symptoms. Tetrabenazine was approved in 2008 by the FDA. This medicine helps slow some of the restless movements of chorea. Other medicines that can help with psychiatric symptoms and movements are benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants usually taken for seizures.\nClinical trials.\nScience Daily reported on May 6, 2019 that an international clinical trial has found a new drug is safe. It reported that the drug used by UBC researchers successfully lowers levels of Huntingtin protein."}

The plural is \u201cglissandi\u201d. In written music the instruction to the player is often shortened to \u201cgliss\u201d. The word comes from the French \u201cglisser\u201d = \u201cto slide\u201d.\nWith the singing voice, or with an instrument such as the trombone or a string instrument a glissando is a smooth slide in which the pitch gradually changes, becoming higher and higher. The trombonist can make a glissando by blowing whilst pushing out or pulling in the slide. The violinist can make a glissando by sliding a finger up or down the fingerboard.\nWith instruments such as the piano, xylophone or harp a glissando is a quick slide in which we hear one note after another because the pitches between the notes cannot be played. On the piano there are two ways to play a glissando: either on the white notes or on the black notes. At the end of the piano piece called \"Ondine\" from \"Gaspard de la Nuit\" by Maurice Ravel both these types of glissando can be heard. The pianist has to play a glissando with tips of the fingers or the finger nails. It can be quite painful to practise them a lot. Harpists are very fond of playing glissandi. By changing the position of the harp pedals a harpist can change the scale which will sound when the glissando is played.\nMany modern timpani have pedals which tighten or slacken the drum head. These can be used to make a glissando. The Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k often used this effect.\nSome jazz clarinettists manage to play a glissando on the clarinet. They do this by gradually changing the way they blow whilst at the same time gradually lifting all the fingers off the keys. George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\" starts with a glissando on the solo clarinet. \nWhen composers write a glissando they write the first and the last note, and then put a long, straight line between the notes, and write the word \u201cglissando\u201d or \u201cgliss\u201d."}

It is very similar to a glissando, but a glissando is deliberately written in the music by the composer and may be a long slide between two or three octaves or more. A portamento is a much shorter slide, usually between two notes which are quite close. Opera singers often used to slide from one note of a tune to another instead of singing each note separately and clearly. The habit of putting in portamento between notes spread to other instruments as well. When listening to recordings of violin playing from the early 20th century we can hear that the players used a lot of portamento.\nOver the last half century portamento has gone out of fashion and singers and instrumentalists are taught not to slide from one note to another. However, there are some places, especially in opera, where it can be effective so long as it is not done all the time. It is a matter of taste."}

It is based on the attraction between opposite electric charges. The negative charge on an electronegative atom of one molecule is attracted to a positive charge on a hydrogen atom of another molecule. The hydrogen atom carries a positive charge because it is bonded to an second electronegative atom, which shifts electrons away from the hydrogen. This type of bond always involves a hydrogen atom, and two electronegative atoms. The electronegative atoms are often oxygen or nitrogen. Hydrogen bonds are important in polar solvents such as water and alcohol, in biomolecules, and in many other materials.\nHydrogen bonds can occur between molecules (\"intermolecular\" bonds), or between different parts of a single molecule (\"intramolecular\" bonds). The typical hydrogen bond is stronger than van der Waals forces, but weaker than covalent, ionic and metallic bonds.\nWater.\nIntermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water (100\u00a0\u00b0C). Most molecules with hydrogen bonding have high boiling points and melting points. Because hydrogen bonds are what make water stick together so well, they also help other molecules that can make hydrogen bonds dissolve in water. This is because the molecules form bonds with the hydrogen in the water, too, helping them dissolve.\nBiomolecules.\nHydrogen bonds are important in many living organisms. They allow bonds between biomolecules that can be created and broken with control to allow life to proceed. For example, DNA that codes our genes contains two strands that are connected by many hydrogen bonds, like a zipper closing. Because the hydrogen bonds are not very strong, the two strands can later be \"unzipped\" and separated in order to read or copy the DNA. In protein molecules, intramolecular hydrogen bonds hold the protein molecule together in the shape that is needed. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds help connect protein molecules to each other to make many structures important for life, such as ribosomes that create new proteins. "}

The legendary king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus bought them from a Sibyl (a kind of prophetess), and the prophecies used to be consulted in times when great danger happened in the history of the Roman Empire. \nHistory.\nThe books were also known to the Greeks. They were kept in the Temple of Apollo at Gergis on Mount Ida (near Troy in Asia Minor) in the 7th century BC, and said to be written by the Hellespontine Sibyl. From there, it passed to Erythrae (in eastern Asia Minor) and was called the work of the Erythraean Sibyl. It seems that this collection travelled from there to Cumae, Italy and from there to Rome. \nAccording to Virgil in the Aeneid, Aeneas had consulted the Cumaean Sibyl before he travelled to the lower world. The story of how king Tarquinius bought them from the Cumaean Sibyl was a famous legend. She offered to sell Tarquin a collection of nine books of prophecy, but he refused the price, so she burnt three. After that she offered to sell the six remaining books for the same price. He refused again and she burnt another three. Finally he bought these three remaining books for this price so they would not be destroyed, and put them in the temple of Jupiter in Rome. \nThe books were given to the trust of two Roman patricians (nobles). Beginning in 367 BC, ten keepers - five from the patricians and five from the common citizens - were appointed for them. After this (possibly the time of Sulla, 88-78 BC), the number of keepers was increased to fifteen. The job of these keepers was to consult the books on what was the right action or ceremony to escape from threats. Even so, they would not reveal the prophecies themselves, but only tell the action or ceremony needed.\nThe influence of the books brought eastern gods such as Apollo, the \"Great Mother\" Cybele, and Ceres, as well as Greek pagan beliefs, into the Roman pagan religion. \nBecause the verses were written in Greek, the keepers would always be helped by two Greek translators. The books were destroyed when the Temple of Jupiter burned down in 83 BC. Because of this, the Roman Senate sent messengers in 76 BC to find similar prophecies and replace them. The prophecies were gathered especially from Troy, Erythrae, Samos island, 'Africa' (that is, modern Tunisia), and from Sicily and Tibur in Italy. After they brought the new collection to Rome, Roman priests separated what they thought was true, but threw others out of the collection. \nThe Roman Emperor Augustus in 12 BC moved them to the Temple of Apollo, when they were studied and a new copy was made. They stayed there until 405 AD. It is said that at that time, Stilicho, who fought for the teachings of Arianism, burnt them. \nModern scholars believe these books are not the same as the \"Sibylline Oracles\" that were often quoted by early Christian writers from the 2nd century through the 5th century AD. It is certain that when one Christian writer, Athenagoras of Athens, wrote \"A Plea for the Christians\" to Emperor Marcus Aurelius in around 176 AD, at a time when Christians were being punished by the pagan Roman Empire, he quoted word-for-word from these \"Oracles\" that are known today. Quoting them along with writings by Homer and Hesiod, he wrote many times that \"these books are all known to Caesar\" (the Emperor). The Sibylline Books were still to be found in the Temple of Apollo at Rome at this time, so it is thought possible that at least some of these \"Sibylline Oracles\" were partly the same. \n70 lines agreed to be from the real \"Sibylline Books\" were quoted in the 2nd century \"Book of Marvels\" by Phlegon of Trales. This quote speaks about the birth of a hermaphrodite, and ceremonies for sacrificing to idols. "}

It is not difficult to play two open strings at once, but fingering two strings at once can be very difficult, so double stopping is an advanced technique. Sometimes triple or quadruple stopping is needed. This is sometimes called multiple stopping. It is not really possible to play three or four notes at the same time on a violin. The bridge is curved so that the player can bow on one string without hitting the others by accident. Multiple stopping is done by playing first two strings and then, while still letting the sound from these two ring, quickly playing the other two strings.\nMultiple stopping was used a lot in Renaissance music when playing the viol.

It states that if a random process is repeatedly observed, then the average of the observed values will be stable in the long run.

They are all equally likely. The population mean (or \"expected value\") of the outcomes is:\nThe following graph shows the results of an experiment of rolls of a die.

He says it was so simple that even the stupidest man instinctively knows it is true. Despite this, it took him over 20 years to develop a good mathematical proof. Once he had found it, he published the proof in \"Ars Conjectandi\" (The Art of Conjecturing) in 1713. He named this his \"golden theorem\". It became generally known as \"Bernoulli's theorem\" (not to be confused with the law in physics with the same name). In 1835, S.D. Poisson further described it under the name \"la loi des grands nombres\" (the law of large numbers). Thereafter, it was known under both names, but the \"law of large numbers\" is most frequently used.\nOther mathematicians also contributed to make the law better. Some of them were Chebyshev (who proved a more general version of the law for averages), Markov, Borel, Cantelli and Kolmogorov. After these studies, there are now two different forms of the law: One is called the \"weak\" law, and the other the \"strong\" law. These forms do not describe different laws.

Detectives capture a man who admits to the killing of the old man with a strange eye. The murder is carefully planned, and the killer killed the old man's by pulling his bed on top of the man and hiding the body under the floor. The killer feels guilty about the murder, and the guilt makes him imagine that he can hear the dead man's heart still beating under the floor.\nNo one knows if the old man and the killer are related. Some people think that the old man is a father figure. Some people think that the man is strange, perhaps that his vulture eye represents some sort of veiled secret.\nThe story was first published in James Russell Lowell's \"The Pioneer\" in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is one of Poe's most famous short stories, and it is widely considered a classic of the Gothic fiction genre. The story has been made into or inspired many different works in film, television, and other media.\nStory.\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is a story told in the first-person; meaning that the storyteller talks about their own feelings and actions. The story does not say if the narrator is male or female.\nThe narrator is living with an old man with a clouded, vulture-like eye. The narrator has feelings of paranoia, and becomes afraid of the old man's strange eye. The narrator becomes so bothered by the eye that he plots to murder the old man. For more than a week, the narrator sneaks into the old man's room at night, watching and waiting for the right time to strike. However, the old man's eyes are shut, hiding the clouded eye, and the narrator loses the urge to kill.\nOne night, though, the old man awakens as the narrator watches, revealing the eye. The narrator strikes, smothering the old man with his own mattress. The narrator chops up the body, and hides the pieces under the floorboards. The narrator then cleans the place up to hide all signs of the crime. When the narrator reports that the police (whether a delusion or real is unclear) respond to a call placed by a neighbor who heard a distressful scream, the narrator invites them to look around, confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder. They sit around the old man's room, right on top of the very hiding place of the dead body, yet suspect nothing.\nThe narrator, however, begins to hear a faint noise. As the noise grows louder, the narrator hallucinates that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. This paranoia increases as the officers seem to pay no attention to the sound, which is loud enough for the narrator to admit having heard. Shocked by the constant beating of the heart and a feeling that the officers must be aware of the heartbeats, the narrator loses control and confesses to killing the old man and tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the body.\nThroughout the story the narrator insists on being sane, yet at the same time, giving the impression of serious hallucinations or paranoia, possibly caused by guilt from having murdered an elderly man.\nAnalysis.\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" starts \"in medias res\", in the middle of an event. The opening is an in-progress conversation between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It is speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, judge, newspaper reporter, doctor or psychiatrist. Whoever it is, it sparks the narrator's need to explain himself in great detail. The first word of the story, \"True!,\" is an admission of his guilt.\nOne of the driving forces in this opening and throughout the story is not the narrator's insistence upon his \"innocence\" but on his \"sanity\". His drive to convince, however, is self-destructive because he fully admits he is guilty of murder. His denial of insanity is based on his systemic actions and precision - a rational explanation for irrational behavior (murder). This rationality, however, is undermined by his lack of motivation (\"Object there was none. Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, however, he says the idea of murder, \"haunted me day and night.\" The story's final scene, however, is a result of the narrator's feelings of guilt. Like many characters in the Gothic tradition, his nerves dictate his true nature. Despite his best efforts at defending himself, the narrator's \"over acuteness of the senses,\" which help him hear the heart beating in the floorboards, is what convinces the reader that he is truly mad. Readers during Poe's time would have been especially interested amidst the controversy over the insanity defense in the 1840s.\nIt is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very acute senses or if he is merely imagining things. If his condition is believed to be true, what he hears at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart but death watch beetles. The narrator first admits hearing death watches in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, death watches are a sign of impending death. One variety of death watch beetles raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit a ticking sound.\nThe relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous, as is their names, their occupations, or where they live. In fact, that ambiguity adds to the tale as an ironic counter to the strict attention to detail in the plot. The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his son. In that case, the \"vulture\" eye of the old man is symbolizing parental surveillance and possibly the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience. The eye may also represent secrecy, again playing on the ambiguous lack of detail about the man or the narrator. Only when the eye is finally found open on the final night, penetrating the veil of secrecy, that the murder is carried out.\nFormer poet laureate Richard Wilbur has suggested that the tale is an allegorical representation of Poe's poem \"To Science.\" The poem shows the struggle between imagination and science. In \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" the old man represents the scientific rational mind while the narrator is the imaginative.\nPublication history.\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in the Boston-based magazine \"The Pioneer\" in January 1843, edited by James Russell Lowell. Poe was likely paid only $10. It was slightly revised when republished in the August 23, 1845 edition of the \"Broadway Journal\". It was reprinted multiple times during Poe's lifetime.\nWorks inspired.\nMusic\nTelevision"}

It is like a deliberate, controlled wobble. The word \u201cvibrato\u201d is related to the word \u201cvibrate\u201d.\nVibrato is used to make a melody sound more beautiful by making it more expressive. Singers use vibrato, especially when singing dramatic solo music such as opera. In Italy a singer\u2019s vibrato is sometimes called \u201ctremolo\u201d.\nViolinists and other players of string instruments produce vibrato by moving the finger backwards and forwards on the fingerboard. Vibrato has to be learned carefully, as the hand needs to be very relaxed. Many beginners who start to use vibrato will try to vibrate too fast and this makes an unpleasant sound. Vibrato can be produced on wind instruments by small changes of breath control.\nMusicians sometimes disagree about how much vibrato was used in earlier times. People who play music from the Renaissance or Baroque on period instruments sometimes play without any vibrato. Other people think that players of those days did use some vibrato."}

The name of the movie comes from the fictional spacecraft that is a main part of the plot. The \"A.E.\" meaning \"After Earth.\" The movie was created using both hand-drawn animation and computer generated imagery.\n\"Titan A.E.\" did not make much money in theaters. It made only $9,376,845 during its opening weekend, and a total of $22,753,426 in theaters.\nPlot.\nIn 3028 A.D., Earth is attacked by pure energy aliens called the Drej. Its spacecraft uses the energy beam to destroy Earth, while hundreds of space vehicles leave the planet with the last of mankind on them. The secret \"Titan\" ship with Professor Sam Tucker aboard leaves at the same time, but not with the other vessels. One of the others escape the planet, including Sam's son Cale, who keeps a ring from his father.\nFifteen years later, Cale works on a salvage station. Humans have become outer space drifters. They are constantly treated by other races. A human captain named Joseph Korso and his pilot Akima seek out Cale. They tell him that he must help them find the \"Titan\". They say that the ship has machinery that will create a new Earth, in order to save humanity. The Drej want to find the \"Titan\" so that they can destroy it. With Korso's help, Cale learns that the ring his father gave to him can help him find the \"Titan\". Before long, Cale and Akima find out that Korso is looking for the \"Titan\" in order to hand it over to the Drej. They escape from him but become stranded on a drifter colony. Cale and Akima repair one of the wrecked spacecraft at the colony. They use it to go to where the \"Titan\" has been hidden.\nInside the \"Titan\", Cale and Akima learn that Professor Tucker had been one of the main people who designed the craft. The designers felt that the destruction of Earth would happen. Because of this, they gave the \"Titan\" the ability to create a new planet. They loaded it with the DNA of every living Earth plant and animal so they could repopulate the new world. However, the ship lost the energy and cannot recreate the planet. Korso finds and boards the \"Titan\". He attacks Cale and Akima, but one of his men attacks him. Korso kills the man by breaking his neck, then fights with Cale. During the fight, Korso falls over a railing. Cale trying to save him but Korso slips from Cale's grip and falls to his apparent death. Akima, Cale and others from Korso's ship work together to defend the \"Titan\" against the Drej attack. Cale thinks that the energy that makes up the Drej and their ships may be used to power up the \"Titan\"'s systems. Korso shows up again, but sacrifices himself repair a circuit breaker just as the Drej ship shoots an energy beam at the \"Titan\". Using the power of the beam, the \"Titan\" powers up and takes all the Drej energy. The Drej are destroyed while the ship creates a new planet. The movie ends with Akima and Cale standing on their new world. Akima wants to name the planet \"New Earth,\" while Cale wants to name it \"Bob\" and all the human coming to the planet named \"New Earth [Planet Bob].\"\nPrequels.\nTwo books were served as a prequel story before the movie. The other one follows Sam Tucker hiding the ship published by Dark Horse Comics.\nSoundtrack.\nDigital screening.\n\"Titan A.E.\" became the first major movie using digital screen. On June 6, 2000, before it was shown in theaters, the movie was in Atlanta, Georgia and Los Angeles. It was sent to both screens from 20th Century Fox using a private internet LAN line.

He was one of the most important composers of instrumental music in the mid-17th century. \nNothing is known about his early life. He became a member of the imperial chapel in the mid 1630\u2019s. His job there was probably a violinist. We know very little about his life, except that over the years he became a famous composer. The emperor must have liked him because he gave him presents of money and gold chains.\nIn 1671 he became deputy Kapellmeister at the imperial court. In 1673 the emperor gave him the honorary title \u201cvon Ehrenruef\u201d which he put after his name. A few years later the court moved to Prague to try to escape the plague that was killing so many people in Vienna. At the end of 1679 the emperor\u2019s Kapellmeister died and Schmelzer became Kapellmeister. It was the first time that the Kapellmeister at the Habsburg court had not been a foreigner but an Austrian. However, the following March Schmelzer died of the plague.\nSchmelzer wrote a lot of music for small groups of instruments as well as a lot of ballet music. His dance suites are made up of several dances such as galliard, bourree, sarabande, gigue, gavotte and allemande as well as more unusual dances. He wrote several sonatas for two violins and continuo. They are full of fast scales and arpeggios. He also seems to have written church music, but it has all been lost."}

Quasars are not much larger than the Solar System. The mechanism of brightness changes probably involves relativistic beaming of jets pointed nearly directly toward us. The highest redshift quasar known () has a redshift of 7.085, which means it is about 29 billion light-years from Earth. This estimate is made using the concept of comoving distance.\nScientists now agree that a quasar is a compact region in the center of a massive galaxy surrounding a central supermassive black hole. Its size is 10\u201310,000 times the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. The energy emitted by a quasar is gravitational energy, created from mass falling onto the accretion disc around the black hole.\nQuasars are extremely luminous. They were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves and visible light. The light (and other energy) appeared to be similar to stars, rather than large sources like galaxies. On the other hand, their spectra had very broad emission lines, unlike any known from stars, hence \"quasi-stellar\". Their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of the Milky Way.\nThe accretion discs of central supermassive black holes can convert about 10% of the mass of an object into energy.\nThis mechanism explains why quasars were more common in the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it. \nThis means that most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, may have gone through an active stage as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy. They are now dormant because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation."}

Its members are elected by all Irish citizens of voting age (which is now 18). Members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann are called \"Teachta Dala\" (TD).\nHistory.\nFirst D\u00e1il.\nThe First D\u00e1il was elected at the British General election of 1918. The Sinn F\u00e9in people who were elected did not go to the House of Commons. Instead they stayed in Dublin and set up the First D\u00e1il.\nThe First D\u00e1il passed the Declaration of Independence of the Irish Republic, a Constitution, and set up a government.\nThe first British woman MP was Countess Markiewicz. Because she was a Sinn F\u00e9iner, she went to the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann instead. That is why many people think Lady Astor was Britain's first woman MP.\nSecond D\u00e1il.\nIn 1922, during the War of Independence, the British passed the Government of Ireland Act. The act set up two parliaments, one for Northern Ireland and one for Southern Ireland. There was no election in Southern Ireland because only Sinn F\u00e9in candidates stood. They did not meet as the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. Instead they, and the only Sinn Feiner elected only in Northern Ireland met as the Second D\u00e1il.\nOn the first day of the Second D\u00e1il \u00c9amon de Valera, President of the Irish Republic, said there would be no need to fight or negotiate with Britain if the British prime minister remembered that he had said De Valera said that if Poland had the right to its own government, so did Ireland.\nThe Second D\u00e1il ratified (that is, confirmed) the Anglo-Irish Treaty, by a vote of 64 to 57. After this the 64 pro-treaty members met as the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, with the four University MPs, and voted to accept the treaty again.\nThird D\u00e1il.\nThe Third D\u00e1il was two things.\nThe Third D\u00e1il passed the constitution of the Irish Free State, and after 6 December 1922, it was the lower house of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State.\nD\u00e1il Debates.\nThe official record of everything said in the D\u00e1il is called or .

Webern and Alban Berg were the most famous pupils of Arnold Schoenberg, the composer who had invented the twelve tone system. This style of composition is often called the \u201cSecond Viennese School\u201d. Webern was probably Schoenberg\u2019s first pupil, and Berg joined them a few weeks later. Webern used the rules of the twelve tone system very strictly in his music. His compositions had a lot of influence on composers of the mid-20th century who were interested in serialism, especially Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez. Most of Webern\u2019s compositions are very short.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nAnton was born Anton von Webern. Webern\u2019s father was a mining engineer who later got an important government job. The family had belonged to the nobility which is why they had \u201cvon\u201d before the family name. In 1918 a law was made in Austria to stop people from using \u201cvon\u201d as part of their name, and so from then onwards he was always known as \u201cAnton Webern\u201d. Anton learned to play the cello and the piano. They had a country house where the family spent the summer, and the young boy spent a lot of time composing, especially songs to the poems of famous German poets such as Stefan George and Richard Dehmel. Together with his friend and cousin Ernst he read the philosophical books of Friedrich Nietzsche, studied modern paintings and listened to the music of Richard Wagner. His father took him to the Bayreuth Festival. \nHe went to study at the University of Vienna where he continued to compose a lot of music. By 1906 he had been given a doctorate for writing about the composer Heinrich Isaac.\nInfluence of Schoenberg.\nWhen Webern became a pupil of Schoenberg he was joining a small group of musicians who were to be lifelong friends. Alban Berg was a member of this group. The music these people were writing sounded very modern at the time and they had to face a lot of criticism. Berg and Webern were official pupils of Schoenberg only for two years, but they continued to work with him, often copying out music for him. They also helped him financially and, when Schoenberg moved to Berlin, Webern moved there to be near him.\nMid career.\nWebern composed more twelve-tone music during these years. He also worked as a conductor to earn some money. He was only interested in music by German and Austrian composers. He tried to get several teaching jobs, but the only one he managed to get was at the Israel Institute for the Blind in Vienna, where he taught for six years.\nLater years.\nDuring the 1930s Webern faced many difficulties. He did not have much money, Schoenberg went to live in France and then the United States because of the political situation in Europe. Alban Berg died in 1935 and his own conducting career came to an end. When the Nazis came to power in Austria they banned Webern\u2019s music because they thought it was bad (they called it \u201cdegenerate art\u201d). His son was killed fighting in World War II. Four months after the war had ended he was sitting on the veranda of his daughter\u2019s house smoking a cigar after dinner when he was shot dead by one of the occupying troops. He should have been inside because there was a curfew on. His son-in-law had just been arrested for selling things on the black market.\nHis music.\nWebern\u2019s early music was in the style of expressionism. Later he wrote using the twelve tone system. He liked using very high and very low notes, as well as silences in his music. Although most of his pieces were very short, every note was carefully planned. Officially he composed 31 works, and these fit onto 6 CDs. A lot of his music still sounds very modern to us today.\nReferences.\nGroves Dictionary of Music Online"}

Usually Pacific hurricanes weaken a lot before getting to land.\nO\nNormally, rainfall is the only effect that Pacific hurricanes have on California. Sometimes, this rainfall is strong enough to cause flooding and some damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 created damages scattered across the southeastern California area and killed three people.\nWhy hurricanes do not normally hit California.\nThe main reason why hurricanes do not hit California is because of cold sea surface temperatures off the California coastline and the California Current.\nTropical cyclones usually need sea surface temperatures above 26.5 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F) with a depth of 50 meters (160 feet) to survive. But the waters off the California coast are too cold for tropical cyclones, even during the summer. Normally, the waters' temperatures do not get above 17\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u00a0\u00b0F), although El Nino effects may peariodicly warm the pacific waters off of the California coastline.\nAlso the California Current moves down from the northwestern US coast to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, which is the opposite in which Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclones move. While a few tropical cyclones may hit the southern and central areas of the Baja California peninsula, they do not make landfall any farther north than that.\nPreparations.\nBecause of a possible threat of California hurricanes in the future and from the damaging effects of a 1858 tropical storm, the National Weather Service created tropical cyclone warning stations across the southern California coast. But because of the fact that Pacific hurricanes rarely affected California, the idea of a warning station was later brought down.\nThe most serious damage from a California hurricane would be from heavy rainfall rather than hurricane force-winds or a storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, maybe hurting or killing people."}

The movie stars Kevin Costner who also produced it. \"Waterworld\" was released in the United States on July 28, 1995.\nProblems during the making of the movie caused it to cost much more than expected. It was the most expensive movie ever made at the time. With a budget of $175 million, the movie earned $88 million at U.S. theaters. However, the movie was successful in other countries. It made more than a $100 million profit.\nPlot.\nSome time in the future, after global warming, the polar icecaps have melted. The Earth is almost entirely covered with water. The humans that are still alive have forgotten the past. Most people believe the world was created in a flood. It is blasphemy to believe anything else. There is, however, a belief of many peoples that dry land exists.\nThe peoples can be classified into four groups:\nThe main character in the movie is a drifter (Kevin Costner). For most of the movie, he has no name. People call him \"the Mariner.\" He is a genetic mutant, with webbed feet and gills. He also appears to have very good reflexes.\nThe Atollers offer a trade with the Mariner: if he will stay with them long enough to get one of their women pregnant they will give him all the supplies he needs. The Mariner does not accept their offer. He does not like being around many people. The Atoll's leaders are mad about this. They have him arrested. During the fight to capture him, they learn that he is a mutant. They fear him and plan to \"recycle\" (execute) him in the Atoll's old dump for domestic waste.\nAs they get ready to \"recycle\" the Mariner, the Smokers attack. Their leader is the Deacon. He is the \"captain\" of an old oil tanker, the \"Exxon Valdez\" (\"the 'Deez\"). They are looking for a young girl named Enola. She has a map to Dryland tattooed on her back. One of their spies told them that she was there. Enola lives with her guardian, Helen, a woman in her twenties or thirties. Helen and Enola plan to escape with Gregor (the Atoll's astrologer/engineer) in search of Dryland. Like the Mariner, they do not fit in with the other people.\nGregor's escape balloon is accidentally let loose too early (with him on it). This leaves Helen and Enola on the Atoll as the Smokers attack it. They free the Mariner after he says he will take them with him. They all escape on his ship.\nHelen learns that the Mariner knows where Dryland is and wants to see it. The Mariner puts her in a diving bell made out of plastic and swims down to a sunken city (actually the city of Denver) to show her. While they are looking at the sunken city, the Smokers find the Mariner's vessel and take control of it. Enola hides on the ship. When the Mariner and Helen return to the surface, the Smokers capture them. The Deacon wants the Mariner and Helen to tell him where Enola is, but they will not help him find her. The Deacon pretends to kill the Mariner and Helen by firing a gun into the sky. This scares Enola out of hiding and she is captured by the Smokers. The Deacon has his crew burn the Mariner's vessel and shoot at them, but they escape by diving deeper underwater than the bullets can reach. Since the Mariner can breathe underwater, he \"breathes\" for both of them using a kiss.\nGregor soon appears in his flying machine. He tells them that it was \"good thinking\" to burn the boat. Gregor then takes them to where a new Atoll is being built. The Mariner tells everyone that he is going to rescue Enola. No one else will help him.\nThe Mariner goes after the \"Exxon Valdez\" on a stolen jetski. The Deacon and his crew are celebrating finding \"the map to Dryland\". Unfortunately, neither the Deacon nor his crew has any idea how to \"read\" the map. Based on the shape of the area of Dryland, the Deacon believes that the area must be Japan. The crew begins to row the large ship with huge oars, in the style of a Viking longship.\nThe Mariner walks out onto the empty deck of the ship and threatens to throw a flare down into the oil holds unless the Deacon returns Enola. The Deacon does not believe Enola's warning that the Mariner never bluffs. He refuses and tells the Mariner that he would be crazy to blow up the ship. The Mariner drops the flare into the oil hold. The flare causes the oil catch on fire. This destroys the 'Deez in a large explosion.\nThe Mariner frees Enola and escapes the ship which sinks. They float at sea for a while and then have one last battle with the Deacon (who survived the blast) before being rescued by Gregor. Gregor understands the map and leads them in the direction of what does, in fact, turn out to be Dryland: Mount Everest. Gregor, Enola, Helen and the others start to rebuild civilization on the island. The Mariner builds a boat and sails away, back to his old life."}

He founded the Gaelic League, one of the most influential cultural organisations in Ireland. He promoted use of the Irish language, using the Irish spelling of his name and the pseudonym \"An Craoibhin Aoibhinn\"\nBackground.\nHyde was born at Longford House in Castlerea in County Roscommon, while his mother was on a short visit there. His father, Arthur Hyde, was a Church of Ireland rector. He became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language. At the time the Irish language was looked down on seen as backward and old-fashioned.\nHe founded the Gaelic League, or in Irish, \"Conradh na Gaeilge\", in the hope of saving it from extinction in 1893.\nConradh na Gaeilge.\nThe league was set up to encourage the Irish culture, music, dances, and language. Many of the new generation of Irish leaders who played a central role in the fight for Irish independence in the early twentieth century, including Patrick Pearse, \u00c9amon de Valera (who married his Irish teacher Sin\u00e9ad Flanagan), Michael Collins, and Ernest Blythe first became passionate about Irish independence through their involvement in Conradh na Gaeilge or \"(Gaelic League)\".\nHyde himself was uncomfortable at the league becoming political instead of cultural and resigned as its president in 1915. He was replaced by the radical political activist and Irish-language teacher, Patrick Pearse (1879-1916). Pearse led the Easter Rising, and his election showed that the league had been infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, just like the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic Athletic Association\nSenator.\nHyde had no association with Sinn F\u00e9in or the Independence movement. But he did accept an appointment to the senate, part of the Irish Free State parliament.\nIn November 1925 he lost the election to the senate because of lies about his support for divorce (in fact he was anti-divorce) and his Protestantism.\nHe became Professor of Irish at University College Dublin, where one of his students was future Attorney-General and President of Ireland, Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh.\nPresident of Ireland.\nIn April 1938 he was retired, but Taoiseach \u00c9amon de Valera appointed him to Seanad \u00c9ireann. He was not a Senator for very long, because he was chosen to be first President of Ireland.\nHyde was inaugurated as the first President of Ireland in June 1938 and moved into the old \"Vice Regal Lodge\", the old home of the British Lords Lieutenant of Ireland. The lodge was also used by Governors General of the Irish Free State. Hyde renamed it the House of the President or \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in.\nHyde said the Presidential oath of office in Irish. The recording of his Roscommon dialect is one of the few recordings of the dialect, which has now died out.\n\"Fine and scholarly old gentleman\" says F.D.R..\nHyde was a popular president. United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt called him a \"fine and scholarly old gentleman\". President Hyde and King George VI corresponded about stamp collecting. (George VI was legally King of Ireland until 1 April 1949 )\nHowever, in April 1940 he suffered a massive stroke. Plans were made for his lying-in-state and state funeral, but to the surprise of everyone he survived, albeit paralysed and having to use a wheelchair.\nPresident Hyde twice asked the Supreme Court, if a bill was Constitutional (so that the Bill in question can be signed into law).\nOn the first occasion, the court held that the Bill referred - Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1940- was Constitutional.\nThe second reference, the Court decided that the particular provision referred - section 4 of the School Attendance Bill, 1942 - was \"repugnant to the Constitution\". and told the D\u00e1il he was refusing to sign it.\nRetirement and death.\nHyde left office on 25 June 1945. Due to his ill-health he did not return to his Roscommon home Ratra. Instead he was moved into the former Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant's residence in the grounds of \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, which he renamed \"Little Ratra\" and where he lived out the remaining four years of his life. He died there at 10pm on 12 July 1949, aged 89.\nState funeral.\nAs a former President of Ireland he was given a state funeral. As an Anglican his funeral service took place in Dublin's Church of Ireland St. Patrick's Cathedral. But the Catholic Church did not let Roman Catholics attend services in Anglican churches. As a result, all but one member of the Catholic cabinet, Dr. Noel Browne, remained outside the cathedral while Hyde's funeral took place. They then joined the cort\u00e8ge when his coffin left the cathedral. \u00c9amon de Valera, by now Leader of the Opposition, was represented by a senior Fianna F\u00e1il figure who was a member of the Church of Ireland, Erskine Childers, a future President of Ireland himself. Hyde was buried in County Roscommon, where he had spent most of his childhood life."}

He was elected after the death of President Childers, but he resigned in 1976 after a clash with the government. He also had a notable legal career, including serving as Chief Justice of Ireland.\nCearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh was born in Bray, County Wicklow.\nCareer.\n\u00d3 D\u00e1laigh trained as a lawyer. He became Ireland's youngest Attorney-General in 1946 under Taoiseach \u00c9amon de Valera. He was re-appointed as Attorney-General in 1951 and in 1953 he became the youngest member of the Supreme Court. Less than a decade later, he became the youngest Chief Justice of Ireland.\nWhen Ireland joined the European Economic Community, Jack Lynch appointed \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh as Ireland's judge on the European Court of Justice. When President Childers died suddenly in 1974, all parties agreed to nominate \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh for the post.\nPresident of Ireland.\n\u00d3 D\u00e1laigh proved to be a mixed success as president. While popular with Irish language enthusiasts and artists he had a strained relationship with the Coalition Government.\nIn 1976 he decided to refer a series of tough state security Bills to the Supreme Court to test their constitutionality. This worried and angered members of the Fine Gael-Labour national coalition government. \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh then announced that he would sign the bill at midnight of the 15th of October, which he made public. There was a historical precedent for the referral of this bill. Dubhghlas de h\u00cdde referred the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act of 1939 to the Supreme Court. Jim Duffy claims that, as a result of this, the PIRA arranged an attack in Mountmellick which resulted in the killing of Garda Clerkin. Others would dispute that the PIRA would have held the President's opinion in such high regard as their members at the time did not recognise the State of which \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh was then the Head.\n\u00d3 D\u00e1laigh's actions were seen by government ministers to have contributed to the killing of this Garda and greatly angered them. The following day, following a minor car accident, Paddy Donegan, a controversial and outspoken Minister for Defence, described the incident as a \"thundering disgrace\". The president thought the minister meant that the \"President was a disgrace\", not what the \"President was doing was a disgrace\". Donegan, a known alcoholic, was likely under the influence of alcohol at the time he spoke. He was speaking to members of the Irish Defence Forces, and was only at the barracks to open a new cookhouse. Donegan insulted the President, who is Head of the Defence Forces in front of the defence forces. created a major political incident. \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh thought that the President and the Minister of Defence would be unable to work together.\nThe apologetic Donegan immediately offered his resignation. But Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave refused the offers, an offer he repeated subsequently. Cosgrave never met the President personally to apologise. That added to two years in which Cosgrave had failed to do his constitutional duty to regularly brief the President. The manner in which his government treated the President was the last straw for President \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh.\nHe became the first Irish president to resign.\nThe incident meant even more people saw the Government as arrogant and out of touch with public opinion and contributed to their defeat in the 1977 general election.\nThe opposition proposed outgoing EEC Commissioner Patrick Hillery for the presidency. Hillery served two unchallenged terms of office before retiring at the end of his second term in 1990.\nDeath and assessment.\n\u00d3 D\u00e1laigh died in 1978, less than two years after leaving office. He is buried in Sneem, County Kerry.\nCearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh was the most politically na\u00efve president, but the Government he worked with was notable for its own inability to offer him the help to overcome the problem. The Taoiseach did not support \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh when Donegan attacked him. "}

It is part of the process of gene expression.\nBefore translation comes: \nIn eukaryotes, translation happens on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm and in the endoplasmic reticulum. In bacteria, translation happens in the cell cytoplasm: they have no nucleus.\nRibosomes are made of a small part and a large part which surround the mRNA (messenger RNA). In translation, mRNA has the base sequence to make a specific polypeptide. This sequence is originally specified by the DNA, and copied by the mRNA. The polypeptide can be a whole protein. Or, it can be just a part, waiting to be combined with other polypeptides so it can make a whole protein. The polypeptide also has to be folded before it works as a protein.\nAmino acids are carried by specific tRNAs with anticodons to connect with mRNA's matching codons. Each tRNA has its own anticodon and carries an amino acid. An anticodon is always together with the same amino acid.\nWhen the tRNA matches with the mRNA, the amino acid that is connected to the tRNA is unconnected from the tRNA and gets connected to the amino acid brought by the previous tRNA.\nSo, a ribosome works a lot like a stock ticker and ticker tape. Many ribosomes, together with mRNA, will attach themselves to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Any proteins that those ribosomes make go into the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it will probably go into a vesicle later. The vesicles will then bring the proteins to other organelles or even the outside of the cell.\nFour stages.\nTranslation happens in four stages: activation (make ready), initiation (start), elongation (make longer) and termination (stop). These terms describe the growth of the amino acid chain (polypeptide). \nSome antibiotics work by keeping translation from happening. Prokaryotic ribosomes are different from eukaryotic ribosomes. So antibiotics can kill bacteria without hurting the eukaryotic host. For example, antibiotics taken by a human might kill the bacteria that is making the human sick but wouldn't hurt the human."}
{"id": "73044", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73044", "title": "Gene expression", "text": "Gene expression is the process by which the heritable information in a gene (the sequence of DNA base pairs) is made into a functional product such as a protein or RNA. The basic idea is that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. Proteins make many of the structures and all the enzymes in a cell or organism.\nSeveral steps in the gene expression process may be modulated (tuned). This includes both the transcription and translation stages, and the final folded state of a protein. Gene regulation switches genes on and off, and so controls cell differentiation, and morphogenesis. Gene regulation may also serve as a basis for evolutionary change: control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the development of the organism.\nThe expression of a gene may vary a lot in different tissues. This is called pleiotropism, a widespread phenomenon in genetics.\nEpigenetics.\nIn biology, epigenetics is the study of inherited changes in phenotype (appearance) or gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence.\nThese changes may remain through cell divisions for the remainder of the individual's life, and may also last for more than one generation. However, \"there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism\". Instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (express themselves) differently.\nThe best example of epigenetic changes in eukaryote biology is the process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg cell \u2013 the zygote \u2013 divides and develops. The daughter cells change into the many cell types of the mature embryo. These include neurones, muscle cells, epithelium, blood vessels and so on. This happens by activating some genes while inhibiting others.\nEpigenetic changes are long-term, and usually survive the process of cell division (mitosis). Changes occur in the chromatin, which is a combination of the DNA and its surrounding histone proteins in the chromosome. The details of how this happens are still being worked out, but it is fairly certain that the wrapping of the DNA and histone is a key feature.\nGene regulation.\nUp-regulation and down-regulation.\nUp-regulation increases the expression of one or more genes and as a result the protein(s) encoded by those genes. Down-regulation is a process resulting in decreased gene and protein expression.\nInduction vs repression.\nGene regulation can be summarized as:\nRegulatory RNAs.\nThere are a number of RNAs which regulate genes, that is, they regulate the rate at which genes are transcribed or translated. The following are two important examples\nmiRNA.\nMicro RNAs (miRNA) act by joining an enzyme and blocking mRNA (messenger RNA), or speeding its breakdown. This is called RNA interference.\nsiRNA.\nSmall interfering RNAs (sometimes called silencing RNAs) interfere with the expression of a specific gene. They are quite small (20/25 nucleotides) double-stranded molecules. Their discovery has caused a surge in biomedical research and drug development."}

A high rate of angular frequency means something is turning very fast. The angular frequency is the magnitude of the vector quantity angular velocity which is also known asangular frequency vector formula_1. \nIt is useful in many areas of maths and science as it allows understanding of many properties of physical objects in our world. In SI units, angular frequency is measured in radians per second, with dimensions t\u22121 since radians are dimensionless. \nTheory.\nAngular freqency is often given in radians per second (formula_2) as it is easier to work with. In this way, the angular frequency is given by, \n formula_3 \nwhere formula_4 is the time (period) of a single rotation(revolution) and formula_5 is the frequency. \nIf a wheel turns by an angle formula_6 in a time formula_7 then the angular frequency at any moment is given by, \n formula_8 \nIf the rotation speed is constant, this becomes, \n formula_9 \nand so it is similar to a speed. \nFor objects which are going in circles, the angular frequency may also be given as (in radians), \n formula_10 \nwhere formula_11 is the speed and formula_12 is the distance from the middle of the circle. \nExamples.\nThe angular frequency is important in determining whether an object can stay above the ground against gravity, or whether a spinning top can stay standing. It also is important in creating the frequency of mains electricity supplies and reducing the heat due to friction in engines. \nSatellites.\nObjects are pulled towards the earth because of gravity.

This meant the king could not have Hull's arsenal. Named a traitor, Hotham was eventually executed, in spite of a pardon issued by Parliament. Charles I besieged the town, that is he ordered his army to surround the town and force Hull to surrender. This siege helped start the fighting in the Civil War.\nHull became a city in 1897 This was then time when the city was the richest it had ever been. Catching whales and fishing were very important. Whaling is now banned, and fishing is limited by EU rules. But Hull is still a major port sending bulk goods and commercial road traffic by RORO ferry to and from the Dutch ports of Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and on to Europe. Hull is also an important centre of food-processing for the United Kingdom.\nIn the Second World War much of the city centre was completely destroyed. Hull was the most severely-bombed city or town apart from London during World War II, with 95% of houses being damaged or destroyed.\nHull was hit hard by the June 2007 floods. There was standing water over a wide area affecting 20% of the city's housing and damaging 90 out of its 105 schools. But the flooding was not as dramatic as the localised flooding in Sheffield and Doncaster. Newspapers and television reported about other areas, and Hull Council leader Carl Minns said Hull was the \"forgotten city\" of the floods.\nDamage to schools alone has been estimated at \u00a3100 million.\nGeography.\nKingston upon Hull's city centre is close to the Humber. The city is surrounded by the rural East Riding of Yorkshire, isolating it from the rest of the United Kingdom.\nMuch of Hull is on reclaimed land at or below sea level. The Hull Tidal Surge Barrier is where the River Hull joins the Humber Estuary and is lowered at times when unusually high tides are expected. It is used between 8 and 12 times per year and protects about 10,000 people from flooding.\nDue to its low level, Hull is expected to be at increasing levels of risk from flooding due to global warming.\nThe city is quite small, but there are many villages in the metropolitan area. The largest of these suburbs is Cottingham.\nGovernment.\nHull was a county borough in the East Riding of Yorkshire from 1889 to 1974. Then it became a non-metropolitan district of the new Humberside county. When that county was abolished in 1996 it was made a unitary authority.\nThe governing body of the city is now Hull City Council, based in the Guildhall in the city centre.\nThe council has adopted the \"leader and cabinet\" model. This means that most decision are made by the leader of the council and a \"Cabinet\"\nThe council was the UK's worst council in both 2004 and 2005, but is now rated as a two star \"improving adequate\" council after its recent \"corporate performance assessment\".\nCities and towns linked to Hull.\nHull has the following twin towns:\nHull, Massachusetts in the USA is named after this city, as is Hull, Quebec, which is part of Canada's national capital region.\nTelephone system.\nHull is the only city in the UK with its own independent telephone network company, now called KCom. On 24 May 2007, the council sold their remaining stake in the company for over \u00a3107 million.\nPeople associated with Kingston upon Hull.\nPeople linked to the city include:"}

It is usually one of three parts; the word itself comes from Old English \"trithing\" (itself from Old Norse \"thrithjungr\") which means 'third part'.\nSeveral counties are divided into ridings, but are usually governed by a council bearing the same name as the county. However, the ridings of Yorkshire are so large that each riding was given its own county council. Thus there were county councils for the East Riding, the North Riding and the West Riding. In 1974 when all the administrative counties of England and Wales were reorganised, these councils were replaced by six new ones within Yorkshire (either wholly or in part) called North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Cleveland, Durham and Humberside.\nIn Canada, a riding is a federal constituency, or \"electoral division\" as they are known in Canada."}

It first came from Switzerland. It is named after the \"Emmental\", the valley of a river, near Berne. Emmental cheese was first made around 1353 when Bern joined the confederacy. \nToday, most cheese-producing countries make a cheese called \"Emmental cheese\" - These cheeses often have little in common with the original though, except for the holes in the cheese. In 1882 was the first time, products could be protected in Europe. Already at that time, Emmentaler was made in countries other than Switzerland.\nEmmental cheese is amongst the best-known types of cheese. It is made from cow's milk. Two of the features that make Emmental distinctive are its holes and sweetness. The holes are there because of the way the cheese is made with bacteria which produce the cheese and over time (usually several months) create bubbles of carbon dioxide gas.\nToday, Switzerland, France, Austria, and Germany produce Emmental cheeses that have a Protected Designation of Origin. In Switzerland, Austria and Germany, untreated milk is used; most of the other countries use pasteurized milk. About 12 litres of milk are needed to make 1\u00a0kg of cheese.\nEmmental is produced in loaves of 70\u201380\u00a0kg. Usually, Emmental cheese is left to ripen for a period of 6\u20137 weeks. Ripening it for 8\u201312 weeks gives a more spicy (salty) cheese. In Europe, about 464 200 tons of Emmental are produced each year. This means that about 6% of the total amount of milk these countries produce is used to make Emmental cheese. France is the biggest producer of Emmental. In 2005, 247 069 tons were produced there. For this, 13.1% of national milk production was used. About 19% of the production was exported.\nFrench and Swiss people eat the most of this kind of cheese, about 3.3\u00a0kg per person per year. Germans eat about half that amount, 1.7\u00a0kg per person, per year.\nEmmental is also widely used in convenience food products, because it is so widely known."}

Both seasons officially ended on November 30, 2006. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Aletta.\nOn May 27 Tropical Depression One-E formed. It became Tropical Storm Aletta later on. Aletta stalled offshore Mexico causing minor damage. Tropical Storm Aletta weakened to a tropical depression and died on May 30.\nTropical Depression Two-E.\nTwo-E formed off shore Mexico on June 3. It died 2 days later. Two-E produced 15\u00a0inches of rain in Mexico before it died.\nHurricane Bud.\nBud was a Category 3 storm. It rapidly strengthened and then weakened just as fast.\nHurricane Carlota.\nCarlota caused light rain in Mexico but no damage was reported. It was a Category 1 storm.\nHurricane Daniel.\nDaniel was a long lived Major hurricane that Affected Hawaii with some rain. It peaked as a Category 4. It was the second strongest storm this year.\nTropical Storm Emilia.\nIt caused some rain in Mexico, causing minor damage.\nTropical Storm Fabio.\nFabio caused heavy rainfall in Hawaii.\nTropical Storm Gilma.\nGilma produced light rain in Mexico. It was also the weakest storm so far.\nHurricane Hector.\nHector was a Category 2 hurricane. It made it to the Central Pacific.\nHurricane Ioke.\nIoke was the strongest hurricane ever in the Central Pacific that threated the Johnson Atoll and Wake Island. It formed on august 20. Ioke rapidly became a major hurricane 36 hours later. Ioke went extratropical on September 6. Damage was nearly $100 million. Ioke was retired at the end of the year. It also caused heavy rain in Alaska. Ioke is the most intense storm ever in the central Pacific and the only Category 5 storm that formed in the basin.\nHurricane Illena.\nIllena killed one person in Mexico. It peaked as a Cateogory 3 storm.\nHurricane John.\nJohn started as Tropical Depression Eleven-E and later on became a tropical storm and then a hurricane. The hurricane peaked as a Category 4. John killed 5 when it hit Baja California as a Category 2 storm on September 1. Hurricane John died on September 4.\nHurricane Kristy.\nKristy was a Category 1 hurricane that was outflowed by Hurricane John.\nHurricane Lane.\nLane caused severe damage in Mexico, when it hit there as a Category 3 major hurricane. Lane killed 4 people and left $203 million in damage.\nTropical Depression Three-C.\nThree-C was a short lived tropical depression that started several hundred miles southwest of Hawaii. It died the next day while no where near any land.\nTropical Storm Norman.\nNorman struck Mexico as a tropical depression, causing minor damage.\nTropical Storm Olivia.\nOlivia did not affect land.\nTropical Depression Four-C.\nFour-C was a short lived tropical depression.

Twenty-E did not affect any land.\nHurricane Sergio.\nSergio was also a Cateogory 2 storm. It was also the strongest November storm.\nStorm names.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2006. This is the same list that was used in the 2000 season. There were no names retired from the northeast Pacific list. Therefore, the same list was reused in the 2012 season.\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 2006 are shown below, however only the name Ioke was used.\nRetirement.\nThe name \"Ioke\" was retired from the north-central Pacific list by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2007 and replaced with \"Iopa\". During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name \"Daniel\", citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat of damage. However, the request was denied, as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list.\nSeason effects.\nThis is a table of all the storms that formed in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm.

Storms in this season caused hundreds of deaths and billions of dollars in damage.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Andres.\nTropical Depression One-E formed June 1. The next day, it became Tropical Storm Andres. After a brief period of a normal track, Andres was picked up, becoming the first named storm to threaten Central America sine Simone in 1968. It then turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter. The only casualties were two fishermen who were reported missing.\nTropical Storm Blanca.\nBlanca was a short-lived tropical storm that briefly threatened land. Tropical Depression Two-E formed June 9 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca six hours later. It moved northwest and briefly threatened land on June 10 as warnings and watches were established. Then, a ridge of high pressure turned Blanca away from the coast. Despite moving over warm waters, a weakening trend unexpectedly began, and Blanca was downgraded to a depression. and Blanca lost its circulation shortly after being downgraded to tropical depression status on June 12. There was no deaths, because Blanca's impact was generally minimal.\nHurricane Guillermo.\nA tropical wave that drifted across the shear-ridden Atlantic emerged into the Pacific Ocean on July 27. It organized into a depression July 30 and was named Tropical Storm Guillermo the next day. It quickly intensified, reaching hurricane status on August 1. Guillermo became a major hurricane August 2. It reached Category\u00a04 intensity on August 3 before weakening slightly and restrengthening. The hurricane attained Category\u00a05 strength August 4. Guillermo's peak intensity was 919\u00a0mbar (919\u00a0hPa) and .\nGuillermo then weakened slowly, becoming a tropical storm August 8. It crossed 140\u00b0W and entered the Central Pacific. It weakened to a depression late August 10 but restrengthened back into a storm 24\u00a0hours later when it encountered a small area of warm water. It weakened to a depression for the second and final time August 15 and lost tropical characteristics early the next day.\nGuillermo's remnants recurved over the far northern Pacific. They were tracked to a point west of Vancouver Island. The remnants hung on for a few more days and drifted south before being absorbed by a mid-latitude cyclone August 24 off the coast of California.\nTropical Storm Ignacio.\nA depression formed from an area of disturbed weather on August 17. The depression organized into a tropical storm 12 hours later. Ignacio's location of tropical cyclogenesis was farther north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones form. Steering currents pulled Ignacio north, where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters. Ignacio lost tropical characteristics August 19. The extratropical cyclone was absorbed by Gulermeno and another extratropical cyclone.\nIt brought gusty winds to California coastal waters before dissipating. Damage is at $50 million. The rainfall caused a power outages as well as the worst rain since Hurricane Kathleen in 1976. Ignacio passed directly over the San Francisco Bay Area which is where the worst effects were felt.\nTropical storm Oliwa.\nA tropical disturbance that had meandered south of Johnston Atoll organized into Tropical Depression Two-C on September 2. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Oliwa (Hawaiian for Oliver) as it slowly moved towards the west. It crossed the dateline late on September 3 and entered the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's Area of Responsibility.\nOliwa passed south of Wake on September 6, where it caused heavy rains but no damage. On September 7, Oliwa started a period of rapid strengthening, becoming a typhoon September 8 and a Super Typhoon 8 hours later. Oliwa stayed at that intensity for over two days. While still a strong super typhoon, Oliwa passed near the Northern Marianas Islands. It then started weakening as it curved towards Japan. It made landfall as a minimal typhoon September 16. It quickly dissipated later that same day. Oliwa caused \"damage and several fatalities\" in Japan. \nHurricane Linda.\nA tropical depression formed south of Manzanillo September 9. It rapidly intensified, becoming a hurricane early September 11. It became a major hurricane later that day. The deepening continued, and Linda reached Category 5 intensity the next day. It broke Hurricane Ava's long-standing intensity record. That record had stood for over 24 years. Linda reached peak intensity on September 12. Linda's intensity record still stands as of 2005. Linda then started weakening. On September 15, it was downgraded to a tropical storm. On September 17, it fell to a depression, and dissipated early September 18.\nIn California, Linda was responsible for 8 deaths and $68 million in damage. Five people were drowened in a jetty. Flash floods caused 3 deaths and mudslides destroyed millions many homes and $68 million in damage. The Southwest would get devastated again by Hurricane Nora weeks later.\nHurricane Nora.\nHurricane Nora was the first hurricane to a significant danger to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976. Part of a tropical wave that contributed to the formation of Hurricane Erika in the Atlantic moved into the Pacific and organized into Tropical Depression 16-E on September 16 and Tropical Storm Nora that same day. Nora became a hurricane in a favourable environment September 18 while moving northwest. Its motion then stalled over an upwelling of cooler water that weakened it. On September 20, Nora again started moving. It reached its peak intensity of 115 knots and 950 mb On September 21 and 22 it moved over the wake of Hurricane Linda. This weakened the storm pack down to a Category 1. During this time, a trough developed that turned Nora to the northeast. This carried Nora over a favourable environment and towards Baja California. After restrengthening slightly, Nora made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near Punta Eugenia and again south of San Fernando, both times as a hurricane.\nNora stayed a tropical storm as it moved into the United States. Yuma reported sustained gale-force winds. Rains were heavy, sometimes exceeding the \"annual\" rainfall for the area. Nora weakened to a depression while over California, and it dissipated September 26. Nora killed two people in Mexico. One was killed by a downed power line in Mexicali, and the other was a scuba diving in underwater currents. No one in the United States was directly killed by Nora. However, the California Highway Patrol attributed several traffic accident deaths to the weather. There was extensive damage to areas hit by Nora. Waves ruined dozens of homes. Roughly 350 to 400 people were left homeless in San Felipe, and winds uprooted trees and peeled roofs from homes in Puerto Pe\u00f1asco.\nTropical Storm Olaf.\nOlaf was a weak but persistent tropical storm that made two landfalls and took an erratic path. A tropical depression formed September 26, was upgraded a tropical storm at the next advisory, and immediately moved north. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz. Olaf dissipated, and the remnants moved far out to sea. During later reanalysis, Olaf was found to be a tropical depression during most of this time, but at the time was considered dissipated.\nOlaf's remnants reformed, and started moving southeast on October 5. Olaf then turned to the north, and on October 12 made a second landfall near Manzanillo. Olaf dissipated, and the remnants moved out to sea where they did not reform again.\nThere were a few reports of damage. Three fishing boats were missing near Acapulco, and there was flooding in Mexico and Guatemala. Most of Olaf's damage was from its first landfall.\nHurricane Pauline.\nHurricane Pauline was the deadliest storm of the season. Landslides and flooding caused by it killed hundreds of people.\nTropical depression Eighteen-E formed October 5 and briefly moved to the east before turning to the northwest. In a favourable environment, the cyclone intensified rapidly, reaching a peak of 115 knots and a central pressure of 948 mb. It weakened slightly before peaking again.\nInteraction with land weakened Pauline a bit, and the hurricane made landfall on October 9 in a thinly populated area. Accelerating, Pauline paralleled the coast for a day before dissipating on October 10 while over Jalisco.\nThere are no known damages from wind or storm surge. Heavy rains affected Oaxaca and Guerrero, causing catastrophic loss of life around Acapulco. Mudslides and flooding was widespread, leaving thousands homeless and at least 230 dead. The Red Cross reported that 400 were dead, but this was disputed by Mexican officials. Pauline was Mexico's deadliest Pacific hurricane since Hurricane Liza in the 1976 season.\nHurricane Rick.\nHurricane Rick was the first November formation since the 1991 season. A tropical wave acquired enough organization to be called a tropical depression on November 7. It moved north before a trough of low pressure turned it to the northeast. It was named on November 8, and was upgraded to a hurricane the next day. It reached its peak intensity of 80 knots and 973 mb November 9. Rick made landfall in Oaxaca\u2014 the same place devastated by Hurricane Pauline one month earlier\u2014 and quickly weakened, dissipating early November 11.\nThere were no deaths from Rick. Trees were downed and recently repaired roads were washed out.\nTropical storm Paka.\nTropical Depression Five-C formed December 2, two days after the season ended. It strengthed into Tropical Storm Paka (Hawaiian for Pat) while west of Palmyra Atoll. After drifting east, it reversed direction. As it moved west, dry air and wind shear disrupted its development until it crossed the dateline on December 6.\nAfter entering the Western Pacific, the environment rapidly became more favourable and Paka's strengthening quickened. It became a typhoon on December 10 and passed near Kwajalein with winds of 100 knots. It strengthened further, twice reaching Category 5 intensity. While close to maximum intensity, Paka passed close to Guam on December 17 and 18, causing \"major damage\". Afterwards, Paka encountered a hostile environment and had completely dissipated by the evening of December 21."}

Therefore it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion.\nA simple example of an improper rotation in 3D (but not in 2D) is a coordinate inversion: x goes to \u2212x, y to \u2212y and z to \u2212z. Under this transformation, a and b go to \u2212a and \u2212b (by the definition of a vector), but p clearly does not change. (It follows that any improper rotation multiplies p by \u22121 compared to the rotation's effect on a true vector.)"}

{"id": "73251", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73251", "title": "Endorphins", "text": "Endorphins are natural chemicals in the body that fight pain. Endorphins are released when a person gets hurt, but also during exercise, laughter or sex. In addition to blocking pain, endorphins can make people happy.\nEndorphins resemble drugs like morphine, so when scientists first discovered these chemicals in the 1970s, they called them \"endogenous morphine\". Since then, scientists have identified and named five different types of endorphins, all of which occur naturally in the body. Endorphins can also be found in most animals.\nThey are produced by the central nervous system and the pituitary gland. Their name has two parts: \"endo-\" and \"-orphin\"; these are short forms of the words \"endogenous\" and \"morphine\". They mean \"a morphine-like substance from within the body\". Endorphins are three compounds which bind to receptors. The main function of endorphins is to inhibit the communication of pain signals. They may also produce a feeling of euphoria very similar to that produced by other opioids.\nTypes.\nFour types of endorphins are created in the human body. They are named \"alpha\" (\u03b1), \"beta\" (\u03b2), \"gamma\" (\u03b3) and \"sigma\" (\u03c3) endorphins. The four types have different numbers and types of amino acids in their molecules; they have between 16 and 31 amino acids in each molecule.\nBeta-endorphins (\u03b2-endorphins) are the most powerful endorphins in the body. They are usually in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. More endorphins are released in the pituitary gland during times of pain or stress. Exercise increases the endorphin release too. For the same reason, exercise results in a better mood.\nMet-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin are in the brain stem and spinal cord; they are the pain killers of the spinal cord. Both of them have 16- 31 amino acids in their structure; the first four are similar, but the last one is different.\nAction.\nAll of the endorphins bind to the opioid receptors in the brain. Many of the analgesic (pain killer) drugs have a similar action in the brain. The main difference between the natural endorphins and the analgesic drugs is that natural endorphins are cleared from the blood very quickly. Endorphins are also involved in the release of sex hormones in the pituitary gland. Also, scientists think that acupuncture results in the release of more endorphins. Endorphins may have a role in obesity, diabetes and psychiatric diseases too.\nEndorphin rush.\nThe term 'endorphin rush' is sometimes used in normal speech to refer to a feeling of wellness caused by exercise, danger or stress. However, it is not a medical term, and it is not proven that higher endorphin production after exercise really has a role in the wellness feeling.\nAnother term which is commonly used is 'runner's high'. It refers to the feeling being \"high\" (full of energy and wellness) after exercise. It is commonly said that the \"high\" is a result of the release of bigger amounts of endorphins in the body during the exercise. However, some scientists think this feeling is caused by the challenge, and is not related to endorphin release.\nFor example, in some studies a drug was given to people which blocked the effect of endorphins. These people still felt the runner's high; it means this feeling is not caused by the release of endorphins in the blood. Another study was performed in 2004, which showed this feeling is related to a different body chemical named \"anandamide\". is not an endorphine but is an endocannabinoid, similar to one of the chemicals in marijuana and chocolate."}
{"id": "73254", "revid": "7850910", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73254", "title": "Team Fortress 2", "text": "Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooter video game made by a company called Valve Corporation.\nThe game has nine characters, called classes, and two teams that battle each other in many different ways, like Payload, which has one team pushing a cart along a track while the other team tries to stop them, and a twist on capture the flag where instead of a flag players must capture a briefcase with important papers. The game is set in 1968, in an alternate history. The game is also inspired from many famous Spy Movies and TV shows, taking elements from James Bond, The Man from U.N.C.L.E, and Get Smart.\nThe game was first released in October of 2007 in \"The Orange Box\", a package with \"Half Life 2\", \"Portal\" and \"Team Fortress 2\". It was later released separately for the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac computers. It became free to play on June 23, 2011.\nClasses.\n\"Team Fortress 2\" has nine classes. The classes are split into groups of three, which are offense, and support. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses, causing the classes to rely on each other to win, promoting teamwork. Also, each class can change their weapons to different ones that they find over time or make from scrap metal. For example, the Soldier could change his normal rocket launcher into 'The Direct Hit.' It shoots faster, stronger rockets at the cost of having a smaller explosion size. In general, the different weapons are not upgrades, but rather 'side-grades.' They are better at certain times, while worse at other times.\nOffense.\nThe offensive classes are the \"Scout\", the \"Soldier\", and the \"Pyro\". These classes have abilities that make them best suited for attacking the other team, but also easy to kill.\nScout.\n\"The Scout\" is a young man from Boston with an interest in baseball. He is the fastest runner in the game, making him a good class to use in capture the flag, as he can run in, grab the enemy team's briefcase, and run out. Also, he captures control points at twice the speed of any other class. However, he also is tied for the lowest health of any class. His default weapons include a scattergun, a pistol, and a baseball bat. He is excellent at killing Medics and Demomen.\nSoldier.\n\"The Soldier\" is a middle-aged man from the American midwest. His main weapon is a rocket launcher which he can use to blow up enemies, or, if fired at his own feet, can be used to make him jump very high. This is called 'rocket jumping.' Rocket jumping will hurt the Soldier, though, and if he is low on health, it could kill him. Rocket jumping can also make the Soldier move forward very fast, sometimes even faster than the Scout. Soldier also uses shotguns and shovels to attack. The Soldier is a good offensive class but he cannot move very fast and is easy to hit. The Soldier has a large amount of health, the second highest of all the classes.\nPyro.\n\"The Pyro\" is a character wearing a full-body rubber suit and gas mask, so nobody knows their race, age, or gender. They also speak in a muffled voice so nobody knows what they're really saying. Pyro's main weapon is a flamethrower, used to set enemies on fire. Once an enemy is set on fire, they will burn for several seconds, meaning they can die even if they have killed the Pyro that set them on fire. This is called \"Afterburn\". For backup, they have a shotgun and a fire axe. The Pyro is good for checking for Spies using their flamethrower. This is called \"Spy-checking\". Pyros can help against \u00dcbercharged players by pushing them back with an \"air blast\" or \"compression blast\". The air blast can also reflect projectiles, such as grenades or rockets, back at the enemy team, which will inflict bonus damage. They are weak at long range. The Pyro has a good amount of both health and speed.\nDefense.\nThe defensive classes are the \"Demoman\", the \"Heavy Weapons Guy\", and the \"Engineer\". The abilities of these classes make them best for defending things their team needs, such as control points, briefcases, and carts.\nDemoman.\n\"The Demoman\", short for Demolition Man, is a black Scotsman with an eyepatch. His main weapons are a grenade launcher and sticky bombs. Grenades will explode immediately if you hit a player before the grenade hits the ground, or a few seconds after being shot if they do not hit anything. Sticky bombs can stick to walls and then be set off by the Demoman when an enemy gets close. The Demoman can also replace his sticky launcher for a shield. The shield lets the Demoman charge forward at high speeds, and do more damage with his close-ranged weapon. His close-range weapon is a bottle of whiskey. The Demoman is a very strong class. His sticky bombs do great damage, and can be used to 'sticky jump' much like how a Soldier can rocket jump. Also like the Soldier, the Demoman is good in most situations. He is an easy target for Scouts, however.\nHeavy Weapons Guy (Heavy).\n\"The Heavy Weapons Guy\", also known as the Heavy, is a middle-aged man from the Soviet Union who is built like a tank. Because of his large size, he has the highest health of all the classes. Also because of his size, he is the slowest runner. His main weapon is a minigun which he named Sasha and treats like a person. The minigun does by far the most damage at close range of any gun in the game, due to its high fire rate and damage. It uses a lot of ammunition very quickly, so if he runs out, he can use his shotgun or his fists to punch enemies to death. The Heavy is great at close range or in small, cramped places. Spies and Snipers are useful for killing Heavies because they are capable of doing high damage instantly with backstabs (Spy) and headshots (Sniper). At close range, the Heavy will usually win one-on-one fights unless he is surprised.\nEngineer.\n\"The Engineer\" is a middle-aged man from Bee Cave, Texas with 11 Ph.D.s. His main use is to make buildings. His first building, the Sentry Gun, is a non-moving gun that targets enemies and shoots automatically. It can be improved to have more health and firepower. His next building is the Dispenser, which gives teammates nearby health and ammo. Finally, he can also build teleporters, which can move his friends closer to the fight. The Engineer also has a shotgun, pistol, and a wrench to defend himself. His Sentries are great for stopping anything short of an \u00dcbercharged player. The Engineer himself is weak, and poorly placed Sentries can be blown up by smart Soldiers and Demomen. Spies also ruin the Engineer's day.\nSupport.\nFinally, the supporting classes are the \"Medic\", the \"Sniper\", and the \"Spy\". Their abilities are there to help the team, so they do not typically engage in direct combat, but can if they must.\nMedic.\n\"The Medic\" is an older man from Stuttgart, Germany. His main duty is healing the other classes. He has a machine called the Medigun which, when pointed at a teammate, slowly restores their health. He can also 'overheal' players, which gives them more health than they can normally have. This overheal slowly fades over time. After healing for a few minutes, the Medic is able to use an \u00dcbercharge, which makes him and his heal target invincible for a few seconds. For defense, the Medic has a bone saw and a gun that shoots syringes. The Medic is a very powerful teammate, but is easy to kill at the same time. Since he loses almost every direct fight, he usually stays with a teammate who he heals, called a 'Medic Buddy' or 'Pocket'. This Pocket player's job is to keep the Medic safe. The Pocket is usually a Heavy, Soldier, or Demoman due to their large health and firepower.\nSniper.\n\"The Sniper\" is Australian. His main weapon is a sniper rifle. He often stays in one area away from the main battlefield and shoots enemies from a distance using careful aim. He also has a sword and a sub-machine gun he can use in close combat. The Sniper is very good at killing the enemy Medics, Heavies, and Engineers. While using his sniper rifle, he can focus his aim to charge his shot, dealing more damage. An uncharged shot to the head does 150 damage. Only Pyros, Demomen, Soldiers, and Heavies can survive this without an overheal. A fully charged shot to the head deals 450 damage, enough to kill even an overhealed Heavy.\nSpy.\n\"The Spy\" is a French man. His main asset is stealth. He has a watch which makes him invisible for short periods of time, and a cigarette case with disguises in it. He can disguise as any member of the other team to trick them into not hurting him. This disguise also tricks Sentry Guns built by Engineers. However, there are ways to find and kill spies, commonly called \"spy-checks\". The Spy can also place 'sappers' on enemy buildings, hurting them and turning them off until an Engineer can remove the sapper. For fighting, he has a revolver and a knife. The knife allows the Spy to kill an enemy instantly if he stabs them in the back. He is useful for killing Medics, Heavies, Engineers, and Snipers. The Pyro is able to easily stop him, as even when he turns invisible or is disguised, players can still see the fire on him. The Spy is considered a \"pick class\", meaning he is very dispensable but also very useful to get certain kills. \nGame modes.\nThere are several different ways the game can be played, each with different goals for the two opposing teams. For all games, players are split into the RED and BLU teams. RED stands for Reliable Excavation and Demolition. Players on this team have red uniforms. Buildings owned by the RED team are also usually red and made of wood. BLU stands for Builders League United. Players on this team wear blue uniforms. Buildings owned by the BLU team are usually blue and made of concrete.\nPayload.\nThe Payload game mode has the offensive team pushing a cart with a bomb on it along a track while the defending team tries to stop them. If the offensive team cannot get the cart to the end of the track before the time limit runs out, they lose. If they are successful, the defending team's base is blown up. Along the track are Checkpoints. Each Checkpoint the offensive team pushes the cart over will give them extra time to get the cart to the end of the track.\nPayload Race.\nValve later added a race mode to Payload maps, where both teams push a cart along a track to the other team's base. The team that gets the cart to the other team's base first wins.\nControl Points.\nControl Point maps involve both teams attacking and defending the opposing team's Control Points. A Control Point is a circle on the ground that glows the color of the team that has captured it. Control Points are captured by standing on them for a certain length of time. There are three kinds of Control Point maps. \nStandard Control Points.\nStandard Control Point, or Linear Control Point, maps play symmetrically. Both teams start with two controlled points, and a central point starts out neutral. The team that captures all control points wins. Traditional Control Point maps will go into Sudden Death (or Stalemate) if no team captures all the control points before times runs out. Control points closer to a team's spawn point are captured more quickly by the enemy team.\nAttack/Defend.\nAttack/Defend maps play asymmetrically. RED begins with all the points in their control. BLU wins if it captures all of RED's points, but RED wins if the timer runs out before BLU can capture them all. Points may only be captured in a set order (though some maps, such as Gravel Pit and Steel, may make exceptions). RED wins if it prevents BLU from capturing all points before the timer expires. Points captured by BLU are typically locked and cannot be captured again by RED.\nTerritorial Control.\nIn Territorial Control, the goal is to take over the entire map by capturing \"territories\". Each game is randomly selected from the six available layouts in a 'point against point' game where both teams must capture the opposite point while defending their own. After a team successfully captures the opposite point, the next round takes place in a different area of the map which is also randomly selected. After a team captures all four territories, that team must capture the enemy team's base. If the base point is captured (in Hydro, the Radar Dish for RED, the Power Plant for BLU), the attacking team wins the game. When the next round begins, territories are reset and a new random layout is selected. The Territorial Control game mode is not very popular amongst players.\nDomination Control Point.\nIn Domination Control Point, maps play symmetrically. Both teams start with no controlled points, and all points start out neutral. The team that captures all control points wins. Traditional Control Point maps will go into Sudden Death (or Stalemate) if no team captures all the control points before times runs out. Unlike Standard Control Point, once a team has all three points they win regardless of how much capture progress the other team has. There is currently only one\nCapture the Flag.\nIn Capture the Flag mode, the map is split into two nearly identical bases; one for each team. Both bases have a briefcase in them. The goal is for one team to grab the other team's briefcase and bring it back to their own base, while defending their own briefcase. You must capture the enemy intelligence 3 times in order to win the game, but server modifications can alter the number. When a player carrying the briefcase is killed, the intelligence is on the ground and returns to its base after a 60 second time period. The player who dropped the intelligence or his team can pick up the briefcase before it returns and still capture it. If a player drops the intelligence by falling into a bottomless pit, it automatically returns to its base. The briefcase can also be manually dropped.\nKing of the Hill.\nIn King of the Hill mode, two teams fight to gain control over one point which is in the center of the map. When one team captures the point, they must defend it for three minutes to win. During this time, the enemy team can attack and capture the point too. This happens over and over again until one team successfully holds the point for three minutes in total. It is not needed to hold the point for three minutes at one time.\nArena.\nIn Arena mode, two teams fight to the death. Once a team is completely wiped out, the other team wins. There is no respawning in Arena mode. Another way to win is to capture the control point that activates until one minute in the match. Once this point is captured by a team, that team wins.\nMedieval Mode.\nMedieval Mode is just like Attack/Defend except that there are no guns allowed in Medieval mode. Players can use melee weapons and weapons that don't have firepower but cannot use guns, rocket launchers, flame throwers, stickybomb launchers, or grenade launchers. So far, there is only one official Medieval Mode map, which is DeGroot Keep.\nSpecial Delivery.\nSpecial Delivery is a Game Mode released as part of the Pyromania Update. In this game mode, an initially neutral briefcase of Australium must be transported to Poopy Joe's rocket before the opposing team can do the same. If a player picks up the Australium and is killed while holding it, only players from the same team as the dead briefcase carrier can pick it up again. If the team fails to do so within a few seconds, the briefcase is sent back to its original position. The player who has hold of the Australium must be on the platform that is raised to the compartment at the head of the rocket and must stay on the platform as the Australium is placed into the compartment, launching the rocket and winning the round. There is currently only one official Special Delivery map, and that is Doomsday.\nMann vs. Machine.\nIn Mann vs. Machine (commonly abbreviated as MvM), a team of six players (all wearing RED uniforms) must stop hordes of robots divided into waves from deploying a portable bomb into their base. When a robot is destroyed, it drops an in-game currency known as \"credits.\" Players can pick up these credits before they disappear and use them to buy upgrades for their weapons and themselves. Some weapon upgrades include more damage, faster firing speed, more ammo, etc. Some player upgrades include faster speed, higher jump height, health regeneration, etc. There are different kinds of robots with different weapons and abilities. Some robots are known as \"Giants.\" A giant normally has far better weapons and abilities than their normal counterparts.\nMann Up.\nThere is a special type of MvM known as \"Mann Up\" mode. In Mann Up mode, players complete \"Tours\" using \"Tour of Duty Tickets\" or \"Squad Surplus Vouchers\" they have bought from the online store, known as the Mann Co. Store. Each \"Operation\" has a specific number of Tours in them. Finish all the waves in a Tour and all the Tours to complete the Operation. Different Tours are for different skill levels and have different robots. Completing Tours and Operations will give the players \"loot\" or special in-game cosmetic items players use to customize their character. In Mann Up mode, the gameplay (upgrades, maps, robots) are the same in standard MvM.\nPromotional Videos.\nValve Corporation posted several animations using their Source Film Maker (commonly abbreviated as SFM) program from 2009 to 2012. Each one of these videos are short skits using humorous depictions of the 9 Team Fortress 2 classes in their real lives, and out in battle. Some of these videos have been viewed many times with, \"Meet The Medic\", at 57 Million views. And, \"Meet The Spy\", at 30 Million views, and more.\nDevelopment of Team Fortress 2.\nOrigins and early development.\nThe original \"Team Fortress\" was developed by Robin Walker and John Cook. This early version of \"Team Fortress\" was a free mod for the 1996 PC game \"Quake\". In 1998, Walker and Cook were employed by Valve. At the time, Valve just released its first game, \"Half-Life.\" Valve began developing \"Team Fortress 2\" as a separate retail game using one of Valve's own game engines, GoldSrc. In 1999, Valve released \"Team Fortress Classic,\" a port of the original \"Team Fortress,\" as a free \"Half-Life\" mod. \"Team Fortress Classic\" was developed using the publicly available \"Half-Life\" software development kit as an example to the community and industry of the flexibility of the \"Half-Life\" game.\nUnlike the original \"Team Fortress,\" Valve originally planned \"Team Fortress 2\" to have a modern war theme. It would feature a command hierarchy including a Commander class, parachute drops over enemy territory, networked voice communication, and many other unique features. The Commander class played similarly to a real-time strategy game, with the player viewing the game from a bird's-eye perspective and issuing orders to players and AI-controlled soldiers.\n\"Team Fortress 2\" was first shown at the trade event E3 1999. At E3 1999, Valve had showcased new technologies that they had developed while making \"Team Fortress 2\". This included parametric animation, which blended animations for smoother, more lifelike movement. The game also showcased Intel's multi-resolution mesh technology, which increased performance for the game by reducing detail of on-screen elements that are far away from the screen. The game earned several awards including Best Online Game and Best Action Game.\nIn mid-2000, Valve announced that \"Team Fortress 2\" had been delayed for a second time. They stated that they delayed \"Team Fortress 2\" because they were going to make Team Fortress 2 run on an engine they own, the Source engine. After their official announcement of the delay of \"Team Fortress 2\", Valve stopped releasing information about the game. Later, the game entered six years of silent development. Walker and Cook worked on various other Valve projects; Walker was project lead on \"\" and Cook became a Steam developer. \n\"Team Fortress 2\" became a prominent example of vaporware. It was a long-anticipated game that had seen years of development, and was often mentioned alongside another much-delayed game, \"Duke Nukem Forever.\" Walker later stated that Valve built \"three to four\" different versions of \"Team Fortress 2\" before settling on their final design. Shortly before the release of \"Half-Life 2\" in 2004, Valve's marketing director Doug Lombardi confirmed that \"Team Fortress 2\" was still in development. Valve reintroduced \"Team Fortress 2\" at the July 2006 EA Summer Showcase event with a much different visual design\".\"\nFinal design.\nValve reintroduced \"Team Fortress 2\" at the July 2006 EA Summer Showcase event with a much different visual design. Instead of having realistic visual design like other Valve games, \"Team Fortress 2\" features a cartoon-like visual style influenced by 20th-century commercial illustrations and the artwork of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell, achieved through a visual technique called Gooch shading. \"Team Fortress 2\" was first launched with the Source engine's new dynamic lighting, shadowing and soft particle technologies, and gave the same visual enhancements to \"\", another one of their games. \"Team Fortress 2\" was the first game to use the Source engine's new Facial Animation 3 features.\nValve abandoned the realistic style when it became impossible to balance it with the unrealistic gameplay. For example, it is not realistic to have opposing armies to construct heavily detailed bases directly next to each other. The Commander class was abandoned because players would simply refuse to follow the player's orders.\nValve designed each character, team, and equipped weapon to be easy to identify, even at long range. For example, the coloring draws attention to the chest area, bringing focus on the equipped weapon. The voices for each of the classes were based on imagining what people from the 1960s would expect the classes to have sounded like, according to writer Chet Faliszek.\nThe map design has an \"evil genius\" theme. In typical maps, there are colored enemy buildings on opposite sides of the two enemies. Enemy buildings have a complex set of pathways that the player must go through to reach the objectives. These buildings are often concealed within various other constructed objects in between. Between each enemy side, maps are usually separated by a neutrally themed space. The bases hide exaggerated super weapons such as laser cannons, nuclear warheads, and missile launch facilities, taking the role of objectives. The maps are designed to have little visual clutter and have a theme, as well as have enough careful attention to effective visual design while still allowing enemies to be spotted more easily. This is achieved by using \"impressionist modeling\". The textures used in-game are based on photos that are filtered and improved by hand, making them look visually appealing and giving \"Team Fortress 2\" its distinct look. The bases are designed to let players immediately know where they are. RED bases use warm colors (e.g. red), natural materials, and angular shapes (e.g. circles). On the other hand, BLU bases use cool colors (e.g. blue), industrial materials, and orthogonal shapes (e.g. squares).\nRelease.\nDuring the July 2006 Electronic Arts press conference, Valve revealed that \"Team Fortress 2\" would arrive as the multiplayer component of \"The Orange Box\". In a conference trailer, the whimsical new visual style of \"Team Fortress 2\" of all nine mercenary classes were shown. Managing director of Valve Gabe Newell said that the company's goal was to create \"the best looking and best-playing class-based multiplayer game\". On September 17, 2007, a beta release of the entire game was released to Steam. On the same date, a the same beta release of the entire \"Team Fortress 2\" game was made available for customers who had pre-purchased \"The Orange Box\", as well as for customers who had activated their \"Black Box\" coupon. The \"Black Box\" coupon was included with the ATI HD 2900XT Graphics cards. The beta of \"Team Fortress 2\" was also given to members of Valve's Cyber Caf\u00e9 Program. The beta continued until the game's final release.\nThe game was released on October 10, 2007, both as a standalone product via Steam and at retail stores as part of \"The Orange Box\" compilation pack. Both the Steam version and the retail \"The Orange Box\" compilation packs were priced at each gaming platform's recommended retail price. \"The Orange Box\" also contains \"Half-Life 2\", \"Half-Life 2: Episode One\", \"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\", and \"Portal\". Valve offered \"The Orange Box\" at a ten percent discount for those who pre-purchased it on Steam before the October 10 release, as well as the opportunity to participate in the beta test."}

During this time he had been Minister for Local Government (1932\u20131939) and Minister for Finance (1939\u20131945). \u00d3 Ceallaigh served as Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1932 until 1937 and was the first T\u00e1naiste of \u00c9ire from 1937 until 1945.\nEarly life.\n\u00d3 Ceallaigh was born in Dublin on Capel Street in the north inner-city Dublin. He joined the National Library of Ireland in 1898 as a junior assistant. The same year, he joined the Gaelic League, becoming a member of the governing body in 1910 and General Secretary in 1915.\nSinn F\u00e9in.\nIn 1905 \u00d3 Ceallaigh joined Sinn F\u00e9in. Sinn F\u00e9in then wanted a dual-monarchy. He was an honorary secretary of the party from 1908 until 1925. In 1906 he was elected to Dublin Corporation, which was Dublin's city council. He retained the seat until 1924.\nP\u00e1draig Pearse made \u00d3 Ceallaigh his helper when Pearse was getting ready for the Easter Rising.\nAfter the Easter Rising in 1916, \u00d3 Ceallaigh was put in jail, released, and put in jail again. He escaped from jail in Fairfield in the UK, and came back to Ireland.\nMP in the 1918 general election.\nO'Kelly was elected Sinn F\u00e9in MP for College Green in the 1918 British general election. Along with other Sinn F\u00e9in MPs he refused to take his seat in the British House of Commons. Instead they set up an Irish parliament, called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, in Dublin. \u00d3 Ceallaigh wasCeann Comhairle(Chairman) of the First D\u00e1il. He was the Irish Republic's envoy to the post-World War One peace treaty negotiations at Versailles, but the other countries refused to allow him to speak, because they did not recognise the Irish Republic\nClose to de Valera.\n\u00d3 Ceallaigh was a close friend of \u00c9amon de Valera, and both he and de Valera opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921.\nWhen de Valera resigned as President of the Irish Republic on 6 January 1922, \u00d3 Ceallaigh returned from Paristo try to persuade de Valera to return to the presidency. A de Valera was furious and ordered \u00d3 Ceallaigh to return to Paris.\nDuring the Irish Civil War, O'Kelly was in jail until December 1923. Afterwards he spent the next two years as a Sinn F\u00e9in envoy to the United States.\nA founder of Fianna F\u00e1il.\nIn 1926 when de Valera left Sinn F\u00e9in to found his own republican party, Fianna F\u00e1il, \u00d3 Ceallaigh followed him, becoming one of the party's founding members. In 1932, when de Valera, was appointed President of the Executive Council (prime minister) of the Irish Free State he made \u00d3 Ceallaigh Minister for Local Government. \u00d3 Ceallaigh often tried to publicly humiliate the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, James McNeill. Stunts such as withdrawing the Irish Army's band from playing at diplomatic functions which the Governor-General attended, or in one notorious case the sight of O'Kelly and Defence Minister Frank Aiken storming out of a diplomatic function at the French Legation when McNeill, the guest of honour, arrived, damaged \u00d3 Ceallaigh's reputation and image, particularly when the campaign backfired.\nBefore resigning, McNeill published his letters to de Valera about this. It made de Valera appear foolish, and made de Valera choose a new Governor-General. To the surprise of many, \u00d3 Ceallaigh's was not considered for the office. Instead former Fianna F\u00e1il TD, Domhnall Ua Buachalla from County Kildare, would be the last Governor-General.\nConsidered for President of Ireland in 1938.\nIn 1938, many thought that de Valera wanted to make \u00d3 Ceallaigh the Fianna F\u00e1il choice to become President of Ireland, under the new Irish constitution, Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann. When Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alfie Byrne, said he wanted to be president there was an all party agreement to nominate Dubhghlas de h\u00cdde, a Protestant Irish Senator, Irish language enthusiast and founder of the Conradh na Gaeilge. They thought de h\u00cdde was the only person who might win an election against Alfie Byrne. \u00d3 Ceallaigh was appointed Minister of Finance instead, and helped create Central Bank in 1942.\nPresident of Ireland.\n\u00d3 Ceallaigh left the cabinet in 1945 when he was elected President of Ireland in a popular vote of the people, defeating two other candidates.\n\u00d3 Ceallaigh was re-elected unopposed in 1952. During his second term he visited many nations in Europe and spoke to the United States Congress in 1959. He retired at the end of his second term in 1959, to be replaced by his old friend, \u00c9amon de Valera.\n\u00d3 Ceallaigh did not refer any Bills to the Supreme Court to see if they were legal, but he did ask his official advisors, called the Council of State, if he should refer the Health Bill, 1947 but he decided not to.\n\u00d3 Ceallaigh's Roman Catholic Beliefs.\n\u00d3 Ceallaigh's strong Roman Catholic beliefs sometimes caused problems. de Valera often thought that \u00d3 Ceallaigh either deliberately or accidentally leaked information to the Knights of Columbanus, and the Church leaders. \u00d3 Ceallaigh ensured that his first state visit, following the creation of the Republic of Ireland in 1949, was to the Vatican to meet Pope Pius XII. \u00d3 Ceallaigh accidentally revealed the Pope's private views on communism. This angered the Pope and Stalin. This is why he was not given the papal Order of Christ which was given to many Catholic heads of state.\nAfter he retired.\nWhen he retired as president in 1959, he was described as a model President by the normally hostile Irish Times newspaper. Though controversial, \u00d3 Ceallaigh was widely seen as a genuine and honest, but tactless.\nHe died on November 23, 1966 (aged\u00a084), fifty years after the Easter Rising that first brought him to prominence. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.\nMary Kate Ryan and \u00d3 Ceallaigh were married from 1918 until Mary Kate's death in 1934.\nIn 1936 he married his second wife Phyllis, who was Mary Kate's sister. Another sister was married to Fine Gael leader General Richard Mulcahy, and a brother was Fianna F\u00e1il minister, James Ryan. O'Kelly died in Dublin."}

{"id": "73276", "revid": "24306", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73276", "title": "L\u00e9o Delibes", "text": "L\u00e9o Delibes (born St. Germain-du-Val, France, 21 February 1836; died St. Germain-du-Val 16 January 1891) was a French composer of Romantic music. He is particularly famous for his ballets, especially \"Copp\u00e9lia\", and operettas and operas, of which \"Lakm\u00e9\" is the most famous.\nBiography.\nDelibes\u2019s father worked for the post office. His mother was musical and played the piano. Her father, the composer\u2019s grandfather, had been a baritone in the Op\u00e9ra-Comique and she had a brother who was an organist and professor at the Paris Conservatoire.\nWhen Delibes\u2019s father died in 1847 his family moved to Paris so that the young L\u00e9o, who was 11, could continue having a good musical education. At first he found it difficult living in a large city as he was used to the countryside. He was a student of the well-known composer and teacher Adolphe Adam. At first he did well in his music lessons and won prizes, but after a few years he no longer won any prizes. He never tried to win the Prix de Rome which is what all French students of composition normally want to do. As a young boy he sang in choirs. Later he became a church organist and an accompanist at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique.\nSoon Delibes started to composer operettas. He wrote 14 operettas in 14 years. He was commissioned to write some music to celebrate the emperor\u2019s return from Algiers. The piece he wrote was called \"Alger\". It was a huge success. The emperor gave him a gold medal, personally fastening a pin with diamonds to his lapel. In 1864 he became chorus master at the Op\u00e9ra where he coached the chorus to sing many famous operas. Two years later he started to write ballets. These became very successful and three years later he stopped writing operettas.\nIn 1870 his ballet \"Copp\u00e9lia\" was produced. By 1884 it had been performed 100 times. Together with \"La Sylphide\" and \"Giselle\" it was one of the most popular of all ballets. The story is about a man who makes a mechanical doll. Another popular ballet he wrote was \"Sylvia\". His most successful opera was \"Lakm\u00e9\" which was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1883. It gives great opportunity for the main soprano, especially in the song called the \"Bell Song\". Musicians usually think \"Lakm\u00e9\" is his greatest work.\nDelibes died in 1891, and was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre, Paris.\nReputation.\nDelibes started to compose at a time when ballet had become less popular in France than it had been earlier. Around the time of the Revolution there had been lots of performances of ballet, but during the 19th century there was less interest with the exception of \"La Sylphide\" and \"Giselle\". Delibes was to change that. He had a great gift for writing easy melodies. At one time he thought he ought to compose like Wagner, using richer harmonies and leitmotifs, but fortunately he chose not to, following instead the style to which he was so well suited. \"Copp\u00e9lia\" is in the repertoire of all major ballet companies, and several of its tunes are familiar to people even if they do not know where they come from. \nThe Flower duet from \"Lakm\u00e9\" became particularly well known in recent years through an advert for British Airways."}

The show focuses on a group of toddlers most prominently\u2014Tommy, Chuckie, twins Phil and Lil, and Angelica\u2014and their day-to-day lives, usually involving life experiences that become much greater adventures in the imaginations of the main characters.\nThe series premiered on August 11, 1991, as the second Nicktoon\u2014after \"Doug\" and before \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\". Production was initially halted in 1993 after 65 episodes spanning three seasons, with the last episode airing on May 22, 1994. From 1995 to 1996, the only new episodes broadcast were \"A Rugrats Passover\" and \"A Rugrats Chanukah\", two Jewish-themed episodes that received critical acclaim; during this time, after the end of the show's production run, \"Rugrats\" began to receive a boost in ratings and popularity due to constant reruns on Nickelodeon.\nIn 1996, Klasky Csupo Animation began producing new episodes, and the show's fourth season began in 1997. As a result of the show's popularity, a series of theatrical films were released over the next five years: \"The Rugrats Movie\", which introduced Tommy's younger brother Dil Pickles, was released in 1998; \"Rugrats in Paris: The Movie,\" which introduced Kimi, Kira, and Fifi, was released in 2000; and \"Rugrats Go Wild\", a crossover film with another Klasky Csupo series, \"The Wild Thornberrys\", was released in 2003. The final TV episode aired on August 1, 2004, bringing the series to a total of 172 episodes over nine seasons. The 13-year run (with the 2-year break) ties \"Rugrats\" with \"King of the Hill\" as one of the eighth-longest-running American animated television series. The show is Nickelodeon's third longest-running animated series, behind \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" and The Fairly OddParents. It is one of the longest running animated series of all time.\nOn July 21, 2001, Nickelodeon broadcast the made-for-TV special \"All Growed Up\" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the series premiere. The special was a pilot for the \"Rugrats\" sequel series \"All Grown Up!\", which aired from 2003 to 2008 as it chronicles the lives of the babies and their parents after they age 10 years. A spin-off series, \"Rugrats Pre-School Daze\", aired on TV in 2008 but had only four episodes after Nickelodeon decided to focus on the sequel series. Two direct-to-video specials were released in 2005 and 2006 under the title \"Rugrats: Tales from the Crib\". Tie-in media for the series include video games, comics, toys, and various other merchandise.\n\"Rugrats\" gained over 20 awards during its 13-year run, including four Daytime Emmy Awards, six Kids' Choice Awards, and its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The series became a hit, garnering high ratings, and anchored Nickelodeon as the network's top-rated show from 1995 to 2001. It was Nickelodeon's longest-running cartoon, until \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" aired its 173rd episode in 2012.\nA reboot of the series executive produced by the original creative team of Klasky, Csup\u00f3 and Germain premiered on Paramount+ on May 27, 2021.\nCharacters.\nThe series focuses on the experiences of a courageous, adventurous one-year-old baby named Tommy Pickles and his group of playmates \u2013 several other infants and toddlers, some of whom debuted later in the series. Chuckie, Tommy's bespectacled, red-headed, insecure, cowardly two-year-old best friend; the twins Phil and Lil, noted for their revolting eccentricities and love of digging for and eating insects and earthworms; Tommy's baby brother Dil (who was born in \"The Rugrats Movie\"); Angelica, Tommy and Dil's outrageously spoiled and selfish three-year-old cousin who is a \"rival\" of his friends and the main antagonist of the program; Kimi, Chuckie's adventurous, playful stepsister (introduced in \"Rugrats in Paris\") (later just his sister after adoption); and Susie, a good-hearted neighbor of the Pickles family, Angelica's schoolmate, friend, and \"rival\", who is better liked by the younger children and far more reliable than Angelica.\nThe other characters depicted in \"Rugrats\" include the babies' parents, who are portrayed as often being easily distracted, leaving their young children free to emancipate themselves from such restraints as playpens or strollers and venture out to explore. Such adult figures include Didi and Stu Pickles, Tommy and Dil's mother and father. Didi is a sweet, educated and loving mother who decides to return to college in one episode. Stu is an often-feckless toy inventor whose designs have been known to either fail or break. Other parents include Chas Finster, Chuckie's stereotypically nerdy and mild-mannered father, a widower who later remarries; Kira, Chuckie's sweet-natured, kind and understanding stepmother (later just his mother after adoption) whom Chas marries in \"Rugrats in Paris\"; Drew Pickles, Angelica's indulgent and doting father who pampers his daughter to a ridiculous degree; Charlotte Pickles, Angelica's workaholic mother who overindulges her daughter equally if often seen talking on her cell phone with an employee of hers named Jonathan, although neither of them afraid to put their foot down when they feel she is getting out of line; Betty DeVille, Phil and Lil's kind but boisterous feminist mother; and Howard DeVille, the twins' mild-mannered and soft-spoken father.\nSusie's parents and elder siblings also make appearances in some episodes, and another major adult character includes Lou Pickles, Drew and Stu's father and Tommy, Angelica, and Dil's grandfather; an elderly widower who later remarries with an active woman named Lulu. Didi's parents, Jewish immigrants named Boris and Minka, also appear numerous times and serve as important characters and are often seen bickering. \"Rugrats\" also has animal characters, including the Pickles family dog, Spike, and Angelica's pet cat Fluffy. Spike played important roles, but most importantly was always ready to rescue Tommy when he was in danger.\nThe show functions under a translation convention for baby talk, which is presented as essentially a separate language which only other babies can understand. The babies' dialogue is almost universally translated for viewers into comprehensible English dialogue, but adults in the series cannot understand them. One example of this dissonance is when Tommy says \"Reptar!\", (the title character of a popular in-show children's franchise) but his mother then responds that she heard him say \"riff-raff\", and that she hopes he is getting close to speaking full words, indicating that adult characters still hear the dialogue of baby characters as babbling. The translated dialogue of the babies is still presented as infantile English, reflecting their limited understanding of the world. Another major point of this plot convention is that toddlers who have learned to speak the adult language can still understand baby talk because they are at a transitional age between the two. Angelica and Susie can understand what the baby characters are saying but can also communicate with adults, though they never outright reveal to the adults that they can comprehend complex messages from the babies. Very young newborns, such as Tommy's little brother, cannot yet communicate even with baby talk, although Dil has a very limited vocabulary consisting of the words \"poopy\" and \"mine\" which are perhaps the only words he is capable of saying. The older babies, such as Tommy and Chuckie, are able to interpret what Dil is trying to communicate although, due to their own age, it is difficult. When the older babies do figure out what Dil wants or needs, it usually involves changing his diaper or giving him an object \u2013 to play with or just to experience the joy of holding it."}

These are made of protein molecules such as glycoproteins. Receptors bind (attach) to specialised molecules. If the receptor has this molecule, it is activated, but if it does not it is deactivated. Depending on its state, a change inside the cell happens. \nCell surface receptors (membrane receptors, transmembrane receptors) take part in communication between the cell and the outside world. Extracellular signalling molecules (usually hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, growth factors or cell recognition molecules) attach to the receptor. This triggers changes in the function of the cell. The process is called signal transduction: The binding starts a chemical change on the inside of the membrane.\nReceptors work like locks and keys. With the key, the lock can be locked or unlocked. If it is unlocked, the door belonging to it can be opened.\nStructure.\nPart of the receptor sticks out of the cell membrane. The same applies to the membranes of cell organelles. A receptor's main function is to recognize and respond to a specific ligand, for example, a neurotransmitter or hormone. Some receptors respond to changes in 'transmembrane potential' (the difference in electric potential between the inside and the outside of a cell).\nThe middle part, inside the membrane itself, is a protein-lined pore through the membrane, or 'ion channel'. When the ligand binds to the surface, the pore becomes accessible to ions, which then pass through. In other cases, where differences in electric potential occur, the receptor changes in shape, which causes change inside the cell.\nThe inside (or cytoplasmic) part of the receptor interacts with the inside of the cell or organelle. There are several different kinds of receptor, each of which acts in a different way."}
{"id": "73284", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73284", "title": "Copp\u00e9lia", "text": "Copp\u00e9lia ou La fille aux yeux d'email () is probably the best-known and most performed comedy ballet in the world. Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on and Charles Nuitter based the ballet on E. T. A. Hoffmann's 1816 fairy tale \"Der Sandmann\" (). L\u00e9o Delibes wrote the music. Saint-L\u00e9on choreographed the ballet.\nThe ballet is set in a Polish village long ago. Swanhilda and Frantz are sweethearts. Swanhilda thinks Frantz is in love with Copp\u00e9lia, a strange girl in the house of a dollmaker named Dr. Copp\u00e9lius. Swanhilda discovers Copp\u00e9lia is a doll. Dr. Copp\u00e9lius tries to bring the doll to life using Frantz's life force. Swanhilda saves her sweetheart's life, and the two live happily ever after.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" was in rehearsal for three years. It had many troubles. One was finding just the right dancer to portray Swanhilda. Sixteen-year-old Giuseppina Bozzacchi was finally chosen. Frantz was played by Eugenie Fiocre. The ballet was first performed on 25 May 1870 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Imp\u00e9rial de l\u00b4Op\u00e9ra in Paris. \"Copp\u00e9lia\" was a great success. It has been performed around the world.\nStory of the ballet.\nAct I. Copp\u00e9lia is set in a small village in Poland at the end of the 18th century. Swanhilda and Frantz are young peasants. They are sweethearts. Frantz however is flirting with Copp\u00e9lia, a strange girl in the dark house of a dollmaker named Dr. Copp\u00e9lius. Swanhilda is upset with her sweetheart's behavior.\nOne evening, Dr. Copp\u00e9lius leaves home. He drops his key in the street. Swanhilda finds the key. She opens his door and goes into the house with her girlfriends. Frantz enters the street quietly. He puts a ladder against a window of the house. Coppelius returns and chases Frantz away.\nAct II. Swanhilda and her girlfriends explore Dr. Copp\u00e9lius's workroom. It is filled with life-size dolls. Swanhilda discovers Copp\u00e9lia is also a doll. Copp\u00e9lius enters and chases the girls away. Swanhilda hides. Frantz climbs through the window. Copp\u00e9lius welcomes him. He needs a human sacrifice to bring Copp\u00e9lia to life.\nCopp\u00e9lius give Frantz a glass of wine. The boy falls asleep. The dollmaker performs a magic spell. He tries to bring Copp\u00e9lia to life using Frantz's life force. Swanhilda pretends to be Copp\u00e9lia. She destroys the workroom, and saves Frantz's life. Copp\u00e9lius faints as the sweethearts run away.\nAct III. A new church bell is blessed. Swanhilda and Frantz (and other couples) are going to be married. They have all been given dowries by the Lord of the Manor. Dr. Copp\u00e9lius enters. He is angry. He wants to be paid for the damage done to his workroom. Swanhilda offers her dowry.\nThe Lord of the Manor allows Swanhilda to keep her dowry. He agrees to pay for the damages. The couples enter the chapel. The celebrations start with the \"Dance of the Hours\". Dawn, Day, the Hour of Prayer, and other dances are performed. The married couples return. All rejoice.\nFairy tale to ballet.\nSeveral changes were made to Hoffmann's dark fairy tale when it was adapted to the bright and gay \"Copp\u00e9lia\". In Hoffmann's fairy tale, for example, the doll comes to life through the hero's life force. In the ballet though, the doll remains a doll. Copp\u00e9lius's attempt to bring it to life is thwarted by Swanhilda.\nIn another example, Hoffmann's hero sees the doll in a vision. He then falls from a tower to his death. The hero of \"Copp\u00e9lia\" however is saved by his sweetheart. A happy ending replaces a tragic ending.\nThe designers of the ballet chose only Dr. Copp\u00e9lius, the life-sized doll, and the young man torn between his attraction to the doll and his love for a human sweetheart for their adaptation. They set the story in a simple country village. Hoffmann set his story in \"the philosophically oriented bourgeois society\" of the early 19th century.\nThe spirit of \"Copp\u00e9lia\" is lighthearted and gay. The story of the ballet is simple. Its fantastic touches such as the dollmaker and his workshop make \"Copp\u00e9lia\", according to Lincoln Kirstein, \"a trifle presumed especially appealing to children.\"\nDevelopment of the ballet.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" is one of many (if not the first) ballet about bringing a doll to life. Charles Nuitter started work on the libretto in late 1866 or early 1867. He had a young dancer named L\u00e9ontine Beaugrand in mind for the part of Swanhilda. Delibes set to work writing the music.\nRehearsals started. The director of the Op\u00e9ra wanted a star with a well known name to portray the ballet's heroine, Swanhilda. Beaugrand was a lovely young dancer, but her career was just starting. She had yet to have the sort of name that would draw ballet-goers to the theatre.\nAd\u00e8le Grantzow, a German ballerina dancing at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, was hired to play Swanhilda. Saint-L\u00e9on was working between France and Russia at this time. He could not completely devote himself to \"Copp\u00e9lia\". Consequently, the ballet was rehearsed over a three-year period.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" lost its star when Grantzow was injured. She went back to Russia. Beaugrand was again passed over for the part of Swanhilda. Giuseppina Bozzacchi was a sixteen-year-old dancer in the company. It was she who was chosen to play Swanhilda.\nFirst performance.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" was first performed on 25 May 1870 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Imp\u00e9rial de l'Op\u00e9ra. Giuseppina Bozzacchi played Swanhilda. Eug\u00e9nie Fiocre played Frantz. Francois-\u00c9douard Dauty portrayed Dr. Copp\u00e9lius. A real mechanical doll was used as Copp\u00e9lia. Because a woman played Frantz, a \"pas de deux\" for Swanhilda and Frantz was not possible. Nonetheless, the ballet was a great success.\nBozzacchi danced eighteen performances of the ballet before the theatre closed because of the Franco-Prussian War. She died of a fever during the Siege of Paris on her seventeenth birthday, 23 November 1870.\nWhen the theatres reopened in 1871, Beaugrand played Swanhilda with great success. The part of Frantz was again played by a woman in men's clothing. Frantz would be a travesty role at the Paris Op\u00e9ra until the 1950s.\nMusic.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" was the first ballet score written completely by Delibes. He studied with Adolphe Adam. Adam was the composer of the enduring romantic ballet, \"Giselle\", and the first to use leitmotifs in ballet. Delibes, like his teacher, used leitmotifs to identify persons and places in \"Coppelia\". Swanhilda has a waltz, and Frantz has two leitmotifs. Copp\u00e9lius has a dry-sounding motif and the doll has an odd-sounding little motif. Bustling, lively music identifies the village square. Sinister music identifies Copp\u00e9lius's workshop.\nDelibes appreciated the folk music of eastern Europe. He wrote both a Polish dance called the mazurka, and an Hungarian dance called the czardas for the ballet. Delibes's czardas was the first written for a ballet. Other ethnic music in the ballet include a Spanish bolero and a Scottish jig. Frantz has no solo dance in the original ballet because a woman played the part. A pas de deux for Frantz and Swanhilda was not possible for the same reason. The pas de deux now in the ballet was the addition of Marius Petipa. He put a pas de deux in the ballet when he rearranged the music for his 1884 St Petersburg production.\nLincoln Kirstein describes the music as \"sprightly\" and the \"most durable since Adam's \"Giselle\"\". Dance music had become the \"miserable servant\" of the dance, Kirstein points out, until Delibes's colorful, rhythmically varied, and richly orchestrated \"Copp\u00e9lia\". While the music did little to change dance design itself, he writes, it did provide a criterion for future ballet music.\nReviews.\nThe critic of \"Le Figaro\" wrote on 28 May 1870, \"M. L\u00e9o Delibes has composed for the three scenes of \"Copp\u00e9lia\" a distinguished, piquant, and colorful score, excellently orchestrated ... It is very difficult to write for legs with a little artistry, taste, and style. For instance, ballets such as \"Giselle\" are not improvised by the dozen. M. Delibes has avoided the commonplace in a piece where it has every right to succeed.\"\nThe critic of \"Le M\u00e9nestrel\" wrote about Bozzacchi on 29 May 1870, \"The title of child prodigy should be devised for her had it had not been abused in so many other cases; although scarcely fifteen years old she is already a very skillful dancer, what is better still in our opinion, she is a graceful and a witty actress; add to that a well-proportioned, dainty little body, and that she bids fair to have the prettiest features in the world. If she fulfills all her first promises, she will be a power in her profession.\"\nOther performances.\nFrance.\n\"Coppelia\" was, and still is, very popular. The Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet has performed \"Coppelia\" 711 times over 90 years. In 1996, Patrice Bart created a new version of the ballet. He went back to Hoffmann's fairy tale. In the process, he brought some psychological depth to the ballet's characters. He even put one of Hoffmann's original characters, Professor Spalanzani, into his new version. Bart also used music from Delibes's operas \"Le Roi l'a dit\" and \"Lakm\u00e9\".\nEngland.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" was first performed in England at the Empire Theatre in London on 14 May 1906. Adeline Gen\u00e9e danced Swanhilda. The Royal Ballet first staged \"Copp\u00e9lia\" in 1933. This staging was Nicholas Sergeyev's version based on the 19th century revision by Lev Ivanov and Enrico Cecchetti. Dame Ninette de Valois danced Swanilda in Sergeyev's 1933 version. In 1954, de Valois created her own version based on the Russian versions of \"Copp\u00e9lia\".\nRussia.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" was first performed in Russia in 1884. Marius Petipa adapted the original choreography for this production. In 2009, Sergei Vikharev reconstructed \"Copp\u00e9lia\" for the Bolshoi Ballet from the Mariinsky Theatre records of 1894. This version featured new designs and 24 dancers in the \"Dance of the Hours\". Vikharev's version was staged in London in 2010 as part of the Bolshoi's summer tour.\nUnited States.\n\"Copp\u00e9lia\" was first performed in the United States by the American Opera Company at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on 11 March 1887. Marie Giuri danced Swanhilda and Felicita Carossa danced Frantz. Anna Pavlova made her American debut in the role of Swanhilda at the Metropolitan Opera on 28 February 1910. George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova choreographed a version of \"Copp\u00e9lia\" in 1974. Their production used the traditional story in the first two scenes, but dropped the third scene's \"Dance of the Hours\" for a general celebration of ballet.\nAustralia.\n\"Coppelia\" was first performed in Australia in Melbourne in 1913. Adeline Genn\u00e9e and members of the Imperial Russian Ballet performed the ballet on the opening night of their Australian tour. This version was produced by Alexandre Volonine, and was supplemented with music by C. J. M. Glaser.\nThe first Australian production premiered in 1931 in Sydney, Australia. This production was designed and staged by Louise Lightfoot and performed by the First Australian Ballet. Australian ballet lovers then saw selections from the ballet as well as complete, full length productions by both Australian and foreign companies in the following decades.\nChina.\nA version of \"Copp\u00e9lia\" was staged by the National Ballet of China in Beijing in 2002. The dances for this production were designed by Par Isberg. The production opened at the Tianqiao Theatre on 1 May 2002. Wang Qiming played Copp\u00e9lia. The production stayed close to the original, but the story was simplified and made modern. Costumes included jeans for men and short, tight skirts for women. Some of the women danced on roller skates."}

{"id": "73361", "revid": "1081499", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73361", "title": "\u00c9amon de Valera", "text": "\u00c9amon de Valera (born with the name Edward George de Valera, ) (14 October 1882\u2013) was one of the dominant political figures in 20th century Ireland. Co-owner of one of the Irish Press Newspapers, he served in public office from 1917 to 1973. Several times he was either head of state or head of government in Ireland.\nDe Valera was a leader of Ireland's struggle for independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He also led opposition to the anti-Treaty in the Irish Civil War. De Valera was the author of the Constitution of Ireland.\nHis family.\nDe Valera was born in the New York Nursery and Child's Hospital in New York City in 1882 to an Irish mother; he said that his parents were Catherine Coll Wheelwright, an immigrant from Bruree, County Limerick, and Juan Vivion de Valera, a Spanish-Cuban settler and sculptor, and that they were married in 1881 in New York.\nIn 1885, after his father's death, de Valera was taken to Ireland by his Uncle Ned. He was brought up by his grandmother Elizabeth Coll, her son Patrick and her daughter Hannie, in County Limerick. At the age of sixteen, he won a scholarship to Blackrock College, County Dublin. In his first year in Blackrock College he was Student of the Year. In 1903 was became mathematics teacher at Rockwell College, County Tipperary. When he graduated in mathematics from the Royal University of Ireland he went back to Blackrock College He taught in many other colleges, including Belvedere college where he taught Kevin Barry, the young Irish republican hanged by the British during the Irish War of Independence.\nEarly political activity.\nDe Valera was an active \"gaeilgeoir\" (Irish language enthusiast). In 1908 he joined the Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League), where he met Dubhghlas de h\u00cdde, later first President of Ireland, and also Sin\u00e9ad Flanagan, another teacher who he married on 8 January 1910 at St Paul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin.\nEaster Rising.\nOn 25 November 1913 he joined the Irish Volunteers. He was soon elected captain of the Donnybrook company, then commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade. He also joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, which secretly controlled the central executive of the Volunteers.\nOn 24 April 1916 the Easter Rising began. De Valera occupied Boland's Mills, Grand Canal Street in Dublin. After the fighting de Valera was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death, but the sentence was changed to for life imprisonment. This was because he was not kept in Kilmainham Jail with the first prisoners executed. The delay meant British authorities started to check if he really was an American citizen, and wonder how the United States would react to the execution of one of its citizens.\nDe Valera's supporters say he showed leadership skills and a great ability for planning. His enemies claim he suffered a nervous breakdown during the Rising.\nAfter imprisonment in Dartmoor, Maidstone and Lewes prisons in England, de Valera and other prisoners were released under an amnesty in June 1917. On 10 July 1917 he was elected member of the British House of Commons for East Clare (the constituency which he represented in Dail Eireann until 1959) in a by-election after MP Willie Redmond died fighting in World War I.\nPresident of Sinn F\u00e9in.\nBritish newspapers and picture postcards often called the Easter Rising the Sinn F\u00e9in rebellion. From 1917 de Valera was president of Sinn F\u00e9in. He and the other survivors of the Rising took over Sinn F\u00e9in and then turned into a republican party. Arthur Griffith, had wanted an Anglo-Irish \"dual monarchy\", with an independent Ireland governed separately from Britain, their only link being a shared monarch, like Canada and Britain today.\nThat had been the way Ireland was governed with the so-called Constitution of 1782 under Henry Grattan, until Ireland joined with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.\nPresident of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\nSinn F\u00e9in won 73 out of 104 Irish seats in the 1918 general election. A lot more people wanted an independent Ireland after the leaders of the Easter Rising were executed of the 1916 leaders and the threat of conscription. In January 1919, these Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, or \"TD\"s, met in the Mansion House (City Hall), Dublin and formed the First D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ().\nDe Valera was not at this meeting because he had been arrested. He escaped from Lincoln Prison in February 1919, and when he got back to Dublin he replaced Cathal Brugha as Prime Minister . The D\u00e1il Constitution passed by the D\u00e1il said that the Pr\u00edomh Aire was prime minister not head of state.\nIn September 1919 the British authorities said that The D\u00e1il was illegal. The fighting against Britain escalated into the Irish War of Independence (also called the 'Anglo-Irish War').\nPresident of the Republic.\nIn January 1921, he got back from the United States with a loan of $5,500,000 This made him very popular.\nIn August 1921 de Valera had D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann change the 1919 D\u00e1il Constitution to upgrade his title from prime minister to President of the Republic. He said that as Irish head of state he would not go to the Treaty Negotiations of October\u2013December 1921 because the British head of state, King George V would not be there either.\nThe Treaty.\nThe Treaty replaced the Republic by a dominion of the British Commonwealth with the King represented by a Governor-General of the Irish Free State. This was just how Canada was governed. Treaty was finally signed on 6 December 1921.\nDe Valera's opponents said that he did not join the negotiations because he knew that the British would only allow an Irish dominion, not a republic, and did not want to be blamed for giving up the idea of a republic. De Valera said he was angry because the delegates working out the treaty had not asked him before signing the treaty. But at a secret session of the D\u00e1il during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, his ideas for a treaty included dominion status, the 'Treaty Ports', a veto by the parliament in Belfast, and the king as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's would pay a share of the imperial debt.\nWhen the Treaty was accepted by 64 votes to 57, de Valera and a large minority of Sinn F\u00e9in TDs left D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in his place.\nIn March 1922, de Valera made an angry speech saying that, if the Treaty was accepted, it might be necessary to \"wade through Irish blood\" to achieve Irish freedom. Later he said that De Valera's enemies said that this was encouraging civil war.\nCivil War broke out in late June 1922.\nCivil War.\nFighting in the Irish Civil War started on 28 June 1922 and ended in May 1923 when the pro-treaty Free State forces beat the anti-Treaty IRA.\nDe Valera was supposed to be the head of the anti-Treatyites, but he had little power. Usually he had little influence with the IRA Chief of Staff, Liam Lynch. De Valera formed a republican government on 25 October 1922 but it had no real authority and was never like the D\u00e1il governments of 1919\u201321, which was an alternative government to the British, even running their own courts.\nWhen the IRA's new Chief of Staff called a ceasefire Frank Aiken on 30 May 1923 the government had won. Many republicans were arrested when they came out of hiding and returned home. De Valera was arrested in County Clare and interned until 1924.\nThe 'empty formula'.\nDe Valera resigned from the presidency of Sinn F\u00e9in after losing a vote to accept the Free State Constitution (if the Oath of Allegiance was dropped). In March 1926 he formed a new party, Fianna F\u00e1il (Soldiers of Destiny). Fianna F\u00e1il was successful in elections, but for over a year a it did not take its seats in the D\u00e1il. When a new law made candidates promise to take the oath if elected, de Valera and his TDs took the Oath of Allegiance in 1927. They said the oath was \"an empty formula\" that is, just words they had to say, they did not have to believe them.\nBack in Power.\nSix years after it was founded Fianna F\u00e1il won 72 seats in the 1932 general election, and had a \"plurality\" in the D\u00e1il. That is, it was the largest party but had less than half of all of the seats, which would be a \"majority\". On 9 March Governor-General James McNeill appointed de Valera President of the Executive Council . He abolished the oath and stopped paying money owed to Britain.\nDe Valera called a general election in January 1933 and won 77 seats, giving him an overall majority. Under his leadership, Fianna F\u00e1il won further general elections in 1937, 1938, 1943 and 1944.\nDe Valera was his own Minister for External Affairs. He attended meetings of the League of Nations, and was president of the Council of the League on his first appearance at Geneva in 1932. In 1934, he supported the admission of the Soviet Union into the League. In September 1938 he was elected nineteenth president of the Assembly of the League, a tribute to the international recognition he had won by his independent stance on world questions.\nDe Valera's new constitution \u2013 Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann.\nDuring the 1930s, de Valera changed a lot of the Irish Free State constitution.\nThe Governor-General of the Irish Free State could \"reserve\" or \"deny\" the Royal Assent to any changes after being advised (ordered) by \"His Majesty's Government in London\". After a legal argument with the British Government the power this was changed to \"His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State\"\nThat meant that de Valera was the only person who could stop a bill becoming law.\nDe Valera abolished:\nWhen King Edward VIII abdicted (resigned) as \"King of Ireland\" de Valera passed two Bills; \nIn July 1936, de Valera wrote to King Edward in London saying that he planned to introduce a new constitution. This was only a little different from the \"Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann\" (meaning literally the Constitution of Ireland).\nThe new constitution was not an act of the D\u00e1il but was voted for in a referendum, because de Valera wanted a new start for the new country he was setting up.\nNeutrality in World War II.\nIreland stayed neutral in World War II, which was called The Emergency in Ireland. Both the possibility of a German invasion and a British invasion were discussed in the D\u00e1il.\nBut even though de Valera hated Britain, Irish neutrality often favoured the allies:\nIn May 1945, de Valera visited the German minister in Dublin, to express sympathy over the death of the F\u00fchrer. Along with President Douglas Hyde, de Valera was the only head of government to do this. De Valera did not visit the American embassy following the death of Roosevelt, as David Gray, the American Ambassador said he would not receive de Valera. All flags were flown at half-mast on Roosevelt's death on de Valera's instructions\nPost\u2013war period.\nAfter sixteen years in power, Fianna F\u00e1il lost the 1948 election. John A. Costello was Taoiseach of a coalition Government. It was Costello who declared Ireland a republic, making de Valera's friend President \u00d3 Ceallaigh Ireland's head of state. In 1951 de Valera was returned to power but without an overall majority. Many people thought this was his worst government. He spent several months in the Netherlands where he had six operations on his eyes.\nFianna F\u00e1il was defeated again in the 1954 general election, but in 1957 de Valera, won a majority of nine seats. This was the beginning of another sixteen year period in office for Fianna F\u00e1il. But de Valera was only Taoiseach for two years.\nIn 1959 he was elected President of Ireland, as which he served until 1973. At his retirement at the age of 90, he was the oldest Head of State in the world.\n\u00c9amon de Valera died in Linden Convalescent Home, Blackrock, County Dublin on 29 August 1975 aged 92. His wife, Sin\u00e9ad de Valera, four years his senior, had died the previous January, on the eve of their 65th wedding anniversary. He is buried in Dublin's Glasnevin Cemetery.\nOverview.\nIn his recent controversial biography by Tim Pat Coogan says that his failures are more than his achievements, and that de Valera's popularity fell as Michael Collins's rose.\nGarret Fitzgerald summarised his last term as Taoiseach; \n\"Total economic stagnation marked de Valera's last seven years as leader of his party - because all of the chickens of his disastrous commitment to an inward-looking policy of self sufficiency were coming home to roost.\""}

{"id": "73366", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73366", "title": "Operetta", "text": "Operetta is a term which started to be used in the 19th century to describe an opera that was not too serious and often full of fun. It is often described as \u201clight opera\u201d (\u201clight\u201d meaning \u201cnot serious\u201c). In an opera everything is usually sung. In an operetta there is a lot of spoken dialogue, and songs and dances are added to this. Similar traditions already existed in other countries, e.g. in Germany where the Singspiel tradition was popular (e.g. Mozart\u2019s \"The Magic Flute)\".\nThe operetta tradition started in France and soon spread to Austria and other countries. It remained popular until the mid-20th century, when it gradually turned into musical comedy.\nThe composer Jacques Offenbach can be thought of as the creator of the operetta tradition. It grew out of the op\u00e9ra comique which had become quite long and serious. There was a need for shorter, more humorous musical entertainments. Offenbach was composing operettas in the 1850s in Paris. In England such works were often called \u201ccomic operas\u201d or \u201copera comedies\u201d. Then Johann Strauss became very popular in Vienna. He was already very well known in the ballroom, but when he started to write for the theatre he soon became a rival to Offenbach, whose operettas had become very popular in Vienna. Strauss\u2019s operetta \"Die Fledermaus\" (\u201cThe Bat\u201d) has been performed more than any other operetta. In Spain the Zarzuela was a kind of operetta.\nMany people were involved in the creating and performing of operettas. The performers often had to both sing and act very well. Bizet, Chabrier and Delibes all wrote operettas as well as operas and other types of music. In England the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were a kind of English form of operetta.\nOne of the most popular of all operettas was \"Die Lustige Witwe\" (\"The Merry Widow\") by Franz L\u00e9har. It was produced in 1905 in Vienna. L\u00e9har wrote many other operettas as well. Franz von Supp\u00e9 is another composer who wrote operettas in the Austrian tradition. The most known Romanian operetta is \"Crai nou\" (\"New moon\") by Ciprian Porumbescu. \nIn the early 20th century the French operetta became less popular as there was more interest in the Viennese operetta. After World War I Berlin was the centre of German operetta. By the middle of the 20th century many composers were writing light operas which were based on American dance band music. These were no longer called \u201coperettas\u201d. The word \u201coperetta\u201d continued to be used for light operas which were more in the style of traditional central European music."}

The lord \"invested\" the vassal with a fiefdom, by giving a symbol of the land or office. From feudal times up to the present, the term has been used in canon law to refer to a cleric receiving the symbols of spiritual office, such as the pastoral ring, mitre and staff, signifying transfer of the office. \nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, around 2,600 people are invested personally by The Queen or a member of the Royal Family. A list of those to be honoured is published twice a year, in either the New Year's Honours List or The Queen's Birthday Honours List.\nApproximately 22 Investitures are held annually in Buckingham Palace, one or two at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh and one in Cardiff.\nInvestiture Controversy.\nThe question who should invest (appoint) whom was the subject of a conflict between the Catholic church (mainly the papacy) and state (mainly the Holy Roman Empire) in the Middle Ages during the so-called lay investiture controversy."}

The fighting stopped while a peace treaty was worked out. \nIt began because of the 1916 Easter Rising. The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) men who fought the British soldiers that day wanted Ireland to be its own country and wanted Britain to move its army out of Ireland.\n6 IRB members were killed including 3 who were executed. These executions angered the Irish people and caused many people to become \"Republicans\". Republicans lived mostly in the south of Ireland. Ulster was considered to be the most unionist part of Ireland. This was caused by the Ulster Plantations. The Unionists wanted to stay under control of the British Government.\nIn 1917 the IRB was renamed the IRA and in 1919, the fighting started. By the end of 1919, the IRA had beaten the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and Ireland had no police forces. In London, the British government began to debate about Ireland's rule. The war waged on until 1921 when Irish Sinn F\u00e9in leaders and British MPs made a peace treaty (called the Anglo-Irish Treaty). This treaty created the Irish Free State this meant that Ireland was given Dominion Status. The treaty gave all the same rights to the Irish government as that of the Canadian or Australian government.\nIt handed power of 26 of the 32 counties to the Irish Government. The 6 counties that were kept by the British Government were all in Ulster and formed Northern Ireland."}

Each player starts the game with two bishops. One starts between the king's knight and the king, the other between the queen's knight and the queen. The pieces are called either the \"king's bishop\" or the \"queen's bishop\". In chess notation the starting squares are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.\nHistory.\nThe bishop first appeared in that form in medieval European chess. In Chaturanga he was represented as an armed attendant who sat on the back of an elephant. The Arabs called this figure \"al-fil\", which means \"elephant\". The problem was that in Central Europe elephants were not known, so they could not recognize the figure. The bishops were interpreted differently by the different nations. That is why the bishop is a \"L\u00e4ufer\" (runner) in Germany, a \"fou\" (fool) in France and a \"alfiere\" (standard-bearer) in Italy.\nUsing a bishop.\nThe bishop moves diagonally, and can move as far as a player wants it to unless another piece blocks it. A bishop can never leave the color of square that it starts on, and so can only move to 32 squares of the board."}

If there was ever a \"hurricane season\" in the south Atlantic, it would most likely happen during the opposite of the north Atlantic season, from December to May with mid-March being the peak when the oceans are warmest in the Southern Hemisphere.\nCyclone Catarina.\nCyclone (or Hurricane) Catarina was an extraordinarily rare tropical cyclone, forming in the southern Atlantic Ocean in March 2004. Just after becoming a hurricane, it hit the southern coast of Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina on the evening of March 28, with winds estimated near 180 km/h (112\u00a0mph), making it a Category 2 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The cyclone killed 3-10 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in Brazil.\nThis event is thought to be a nearly once-in-a-lifetime event by meteorologists.\nOther known South Atlantic tropical cyclones.\nAngola tropical cyclone of 1991.\nOn April 10, 1991, what was either a strong tropical depression or a weak tropical storm formed in the eastern South Atlantic, recorded by weather satellites off the coast of Angola. It reached a peak on the 13th, and dissipated two days later, drifting west-southwestward from where it formed. Of the few South Atlantic tropical cyclones that have existed, this was the only one in the eastern Atlantic. This was also the first South Atlantic tropical cyclone ever observed.\nTropical cyclone of January 2004.\nA small area of convection developed on a trough of low pressure in mid-January off Brazil. It organized and appeared to become a tropical depression on January 18. The next morning, it had a small amounts of convection near the center and well-defined bands, and the system, either a weak tropical storm or a strong tropical depression, likely reached its peak. Located 150 n miles southeast of Salvador, Brazil, it weakened as upper level shear, normal for the basin, prevailed. The depression moved inland on the 20th as a circulation with no convection, and dissipated the next day over Brazil, where it caused heavy rains and flooding. This would mark the first time in recorded history that two tropical cyclones (Catarina and the January storm) have been seen during the same year in the South Atlantic, and may be considered to make up the 2003-04 South Atlantic hurricane season.\nTropical cyclone of February 2006 / 90L Invest (South Atlantic).\nA small area of convection 600 miles southeast of Rio de Janeiro moved into an area of low wind shear and barely 26\u00b0C warm waters on February 23, 2006. The wave had deep convection, was able to form a closed LLC and had 35\u00a0mi/h (56\u00a0km/h) winds as measured by Quikscat on February 24, 2006. These characteristics were operationally recognized for three hours before high shear began to tear the system apart, just short of the six hours required to be officially declared a tropical depression. It is possible that the system maintained these features longer and may have briefly been a tropical depression. While under study, the system was referred to as 90L Invest. The shear would eventually cause the system to dissipate later that night. Picture "}

It is mainly used for 18th century Italian comic operas. Opera buffa contrasts with opera seria (\u201cserious opera\u201d) in which the story was a tragedy. Opera seria was supposed to be \u201cserious\u201d, while opera buffa was an entertaining musical comedy. Like the opera seria, everything was sung, there was no spoken dialogue. This was different from comic opera in other countries. The story in opera buffa is told in recitative and then there were arias for the characters to show their feelings and show off their voices. \nAlthough we use the term \u201copera buffa\u201d today, in the 18th century they called such operas by other names, e.g. \u201ccommedia in musica\u201d, \u201cdramma giocosa\u201d, \u201coperetta\u201d, \u201cburlesca\u201d etc. An opera buffa was usually a full length work: one which would fill a whole evening\u2019s entertainment. It was different from an \u201cintermezzo\u201d or \u201cfarsa\u201d which was a short musical comedy that was performed during the intervals of a musical tragedy, although the difference between the two is not always obvious. The intermezzo became longer and longer during the 18th century and gradually developed into opera buffa. Pergolesi\u2019s \"La Serva Padrone\" was an intermezzo which became very famous after Pergolesi\u2019s death. It influenced opera buffa. \nOpera buffa always included a lot of caricature. The characters showed human weaknesses such as , , and (people who were pretending to be wise and important). They often poked fun at the ruling classes.\nIn opera buffa the acting was always very important. It was a very lively show, with a lot happening very quickly. At the end of each act all the main characters sang together: this is called an \u201censemble\u201d (the French word for \u201ctogether\u201d).\nOpera buffa started in Naples and gradually spread to other parts of Italy. It was particularly popular at carnival time. Important composers of opera buffa include Carlo Goldoni and Baldassare Galuppi.\nBy the end of the 18th century it was not always possible to tell the difference between an opera buffa and an opera seria. Mozart\u2019s opera \"Don Giovanni\", for example, has a lot of comedy, but there is also a serious side."}

It was different from opera buffa which was a musical comedy. Opera seria was supposed to be about serious tragedy. The term \u201copera seria\u201d only started to be used after the time when it was popular in order to talk about the historic period.\nItalian \"opera seria\" was always in the Italian language, even when it was composed or performed in other countries such as Germany, Austria, England and Spain. In France the opera seria was not so popular. They had their own forms of opera.\nPopular composers of opera seria included Hasse, Vinci, Jommelli, George Frideric Handel, Piccinni, Paisiello, Cimarosa, Gluck, and Mozart.\n\"Opera seria\" was often called \"dramma per musica\" (\"drama through music\"). The story was told in recitative, a quick-flowing music with simple accompaniment. Then there were arias which were the big songs where the singers could show off their skills. They were normally in \"da capo\" form (a main section, a middle section, and the main section repeated). The opera would start with an overture and there would also be some ensembles where several characters sung at once.\nThe stories of opera seria were usually about the ancient Greek and Roman gods or kings. This was in contrast to opera buffa, which was about ordinary people and often made fun of kings and nobility.\nThe main singers in opera seria were mostly castrati, male singers who had been castrated when they were young so that they still sang with high voices. Gradually during the 18th century the female singers got more of the main roles (the \u201cprima donna\u201d or \u201cfirst lady\u201d).\nOne of the first composers of opera seria was Alessandro Scarlatti. In England George Frideric Handel wrote many great opera seria. The most important man in the development of mid-18th century opera seria was Metastasio who wrote libretti. His words were set by the greatest composers in Europe: Hasse, Porpora and, especially, Mozart.\nIn the later part of the 18th century Christoph Willibald Gluck changed a lot of traditions in opera. He did not want opera to be just a way for singers to show off their voices. He wanted the story to be important. He did not use dry recitative but tried to make the drama, dance and music all important, especially the chorus. \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" was his first important opera, followed by others such as \"Alceste\". \nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart was influenced by Gluck\u2019s reforms. His two great opera seria were \"Idomeneo\" (1780) and \"La clemenza di Tito\" (1791). Mostly, however, Mozart was not so interested in writing about the old Greek gods and kings. His other great Italian operas: \"Cosi fan tutte\", \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" and \"Don Giovanni\" are something between opera seria and opera buffa. These were set to libretti by Lorenzo da Ponte. \nOther important \"opera seria\" composers were Luigi Cherubini and Gaspare Spontini, followed by Rossini whose musical style made further changes to opera seria."}

An RSS document, which is called a \"feed,\" \"web feed,\" or \"channel,\" contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS makes it possible for people to keep up with their favorite web sites without having to check them manually. This flow of content between websites and users is called \"web syndication\".\nRSS content can be read using software called an \"RSS reader,\" \"feed reader\" or an \"aggregator.\" The user subscribes to a feed by entering the feed's link into the reader or by clicking an RSS icon in a browser that begins the subscription process. The reader checks the user's subscribed feeds often for new content, downloading any updates that it finds. This content is stored in an standard XML file that many different computers and programs can understand. This file tells the programs how to show the content to the user.\nThe letters \"RSS\" are used to refer to any of these formats:\nRSS is used also on exchanges. An example of using RSS, is Carbon Place, which uses it to show orders to the public.\nHistory.\nThere were other similar formats before RSS that were not as popular. The first one was the Meta Content Framework made in 1995 by Ramanathan V. Guha and others at Apple Computers.\nThe first version of RSS was called RDF Site Summary. It was made by Dan Libby and Ramanathan V. Guha at Netscape and made public in March 1999. This became RSS 0.9. In July 1999, RSS 0.91 was created by Dan Libby, which got rid of some features that weren't useful. It also added elements from Dave Winer's news syndication format. Libby renamed the format from RDF to RSS Rich Site Summary and planned how it should be made better in the future.\nIn 2001, the company was restructured by their owner, AOL, and no longer supported RSS. After that, the format was being developed by the RSS-DEV Working Group and Dave Winer. Winer was the first to write programs that could read and write RSS and were not made by Netscape.\nRSS 1.0 was produced in December 2000 by the RSS-DEV team, which included representatives of O'Reilly Media and Moreover Technologies. This version added support for XML namespaces and RDF, which was previously removed in RSS 0.91. This version also changed the name back to \"RDF Site Summary\" and added new elements that help describe content, such as Dublin Core.\nAlso in December 2000, Dave Winer released RSS 0.92. It added the enclosure element, which could be used to include sound in RSS feeds. This feature is one of the origins of Podcasting. Winer also made drafts of RSS 0.93, which allowed many enclosure elements per an item element, along with RSS 0.94, but those versions were cancelled after being released.\nIn September 2002, Winter made RSS 2.0, the next major version of RSS. This version introduced the following changes:\nTo make sure that old programs which only support RSS 0.92 still work with RSS 2.0, namespace support only applies to other content within the feed, not the elements themselves. Other formats such as Atom tried to remove this limitation, however it never caught on."}

Negotiations are also under way with other states. The process of enlargement is sometimes referred to as European integration. However, this term is also used to refer to the intensification of cooperation between EU member states as national governments allow for the gradual centralising of power within European institutions. Before being allowed to join the European Union, a state must fulfill the economic and political conditions generally known as the Copenhagen criteria: these basically require that a candidate member state must enjoy a secular, democratic system of government, together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect the rule of law. Under the terms of the Treaty on European Union, enlargement of the Union is conditional upon the agreement of each existing member state as well as approval by the European Parliament.\nBulgaria and Romania make up the second part of the EU's fifth enlargement, and joined the EU on 1 January 2007. This date was agreed upon at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, confirmed at Brussels on 18 June 2004, and affirmed by the country reports of October 2004 and the final report delivered on 26 September 2006. Bulgaria and Romania signed their Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005 at a ceremony held at Neum\u00fcnster Abbey in Luxembourg.\nThe United Kingdom was a former EU member state. It joined the European Economic Community on 1 January 1973. On 23 June 2016, 51.9% of voters chose to leave the EU. The country formally withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020. This means there are 27 member states are left in the EU. "}

The purpose of a mouthpiece is to send vibrations down the instrument to make a musical note.\nLarger mouthpieces are used on larger instruments, and smaller ones are used on smaller instruments. This is because a larger mouthpiece makes a lower sound, and a smaller mouthpiece makes a higher sound, and bigger instruments make lower sounds and smaller instruments make higher sounds.\nDifferent parts of a brass mouthpiece.\nA mouthpiece has many different parts, and all its parts have different names.\nDifferent ways to make a brass mouthpiece.\nSome very small changes in how a mouthpiece is made can change the sound of an instrument a lot.\nMaterials.\nMost mouthpieces for brass instruments are made of brass, the traditional material. Many are plated with more expensive metals.\nPlating.\nSome players gold plate their brass mouthpieces, covering them with a thin layer of gold. This makes the sound of the instrument better than with any other mouthpiece. For some people that are allergic to silver, this is the best (but not cheapest) way to play a brass instrument without getting sick. Gold does not smudge, so it only has to be cleaned with soap and water once in a while.\nSilver plating is almost always used on brass mouthpieces because it does not cost too much money and a silver-plated mouthpiece helps a player make a pretty good sound. Silver plating is not as expensive as gold, but it is sometimes very important to have if a player plays a certain way. Silver-plate gives a clearer sound than gold and is good for styles of playing that need a lot of volume. Also, silver needs to be cleaned more often because it smudges easily.\nPlastic.\nAnother type of mouthpiece is a plastic mouthpiece. These mouthpieces are good because they never break or dent, they do not cost as much as silver or gold mouthpieces, and they are good for playing outdoors. They are very often given to players in marching bands. They do not make as good sounds as silver or gold mouthpieces, though.\nSteel and titanium.\nTwo of the newest things mouthpieces can be made out of are stainless steel and titanium. They are very rare, and are only made by a few companies. Steel and titanium mouthpieces do not vibrate as much, so they make a very clear sound, require much less cleaning, and they do not need to be silver plated. However, they are much more expensive than mouthpieces that are silver or gold plated."}

He was the fourth President of Ireland from 1973 until his death in 1974, and a TD from 1938 until 1973. \nChilders held the following posts during his political career:\nHe was appointed T\u00e1naiste in 1969.\nBiography.\nChilders was born in London. He moved to Ireland after the First World War and lived in County Wicklow with his father Robert Erskine Childers. His father helped bring guns to Ireland for the Easter Rising, and opposed the treaty that set up the Irish Free State. The younger Childers was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, and Trinity College, Cambridge, hence his striking British upper class accent. \nIn 1922, when Childers was 16, his father was executed by the Irish Free State. Before his execution the older Childers made his son promise from to find every man who had signed his father's death warrant out and shake his hand. \nAfter finishing college in Britain Childers worked in a tourism board in Paris, until \u00c9amon de Valera invited him back to Ireland to work for the Irish Press. He became a naturalised Irish citizen in 1938. \nAs member of Fianna F\u00e1il, he held a number of ministerial posts in the cabinets of \u00c9amon de Valera, Se\u00e1n Lemass and Jack Lynch, becoming T\u00e1naiste Deputy head of the government) in 1969. Erskine's period as a minister was controversial. One commentator described his ministerial career as \"spectacularly unsuccessful\", but others praised his willingness to take tough decisions. \nChilders was elected the fourth President of Ireland on 30 May, 1973, defeating Tom O'Higgins by 635,867 votes to 578,771. Childers, though 67, was an extremely hard-working and He died suddenly of a heart attack in November 1974, while making a public speech to the Royal College of Physicians in Dublin. \nChilders' state funeral in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was attended by world leaders including Nelson Rockefeller, Vice-President of the United States, Earl Mountbatten of Burma (representing Queen Elizabeth II), Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and presidents and crowned heads of state from Europe and beyond. He was buried County Wicklow. At first it was expected that President Childers' widow, Rita, would be offered the office of president to continue his work, but it went instead to the former Chief Justice, Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh. \nOne of Childers' sons, also called Erskine was a UN civil servant and Secretary General of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. A daughter by 2nd wife Rita, Nessa Childers, is a councillor for the Green Party on D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.\nAdditional reading.\nJohn N. Young, \"Erskine H.

Both were given bicameral (two houses) parliaments and separate governments.\nThe king was represented by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who also acted in Northern Ireland.\nSouthern Ireland never existed except on paper. It was set up by law, but the first attempted meeting of its Parliament failed because it was short of a \"quorum\" (the number of members needed to hold a meeting).

During the war it was Australia's main air defence base. It is no longer in use. The bunker is buried underneath a public park in the suburb of Condell Park in the City of Bankstown, which is in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is still possible to go into the bunker through a secret passageway.\nHistory.\nThe Bankstown bunker is a three-story building that was mostly underground. It was secretly used during the Second World War by the Australian air force. Builders started to build the bunker in 1942. Workers and volunteers began to work inside the bunker in January 1945. It was called the Sydney \"Air Defence Headquarters\" and replaced another secret air force base that was in a secret tunnel. This was the Number One Fighter Sector Headquarters underneath St. James train station in Sydney. After that, it was moved to a picture theatre in Bankstown called the Capital Hall. The main job for the people who worked in the bunker, was to track all planes in the eastern area of the South West Pacific. Some of the people who worked in the bunker were from the No.2 Volunteer Air Observer Corps (VOAC), The Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and a few members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. Workers worked in the bunker 24 hours a day seven days a week in shifts called \"Flights\". The people who worked inside the bunker traveled to work in buses with tinted windows. Everyone that worked in the bunker had to receive special training.\nAt the end of the war, the bunker was no longer used and people forgot about it. In 1971 it was rediscovered by a reporter who worked for a local newspaper in the area. In 1972 the bunker was set on fire. In 1976 houses were built over part of the building, whilst the main part is underneath a public park.\nInside the bunker.\nThe bunker was built in the same fashion as the underground Operations rooms of wartime England, which planned Britain's air defence fighter plane attacks on the invading German Luftwaffe.\nTo get inside the bunker you had to enter through a secret passageway which was hidden under a grassy hill. Stairs led to a maze of hallways that lead to different sections. There were two different entrances to get inside the bunker. The two doors were guarded by special police that worked for the military.\nThe bunker walls were 1.5 metres thick and it was almost bomb proof. It had all the latest equipment of the time to allow it to run as a top secret defence base. It had its own code room, plotting rooms, two escape tunnels, radio transmitter room, kitchen, dining area, bathrooms and bedrooms. In the center of the bunker was a large operations room. This was a large room about two stories high. It was the control centre for all air force missions in the Pacific area. The room also had a big map of the South West Pacific theater of World War II. The bunker also had its own generator, air conditioning and switchboards which directed fifty telephone lines. The telephone lines went to various locations including radar stations and VAOC lookout posts which reported aircraft locations to the bunker. There are rumours of a tunnel running from the bunker to an unknown location.\nLocation.\nThere is a small park at the end of Taylor Street. In this park, there is a large hill that looks totally out of place. It is under this hill that the bunker has been buried. It is still possible to get in through a secret door.\nOther bunkers in Bankstown.\nThere is another bunker in Bankstown. This one is called a \"Remote Receiving station\" not much is known about its history. It was in Picnic Point National Park, near the South Sydney Power station, People who live in the area say that it is still there. There are many other rumours of bunkers in the Bankstown area, such as under an electricity block house on the corner of Milpera road and Henry Lawson Drive, a demolished bunker under Condell Park High School.\nThe Bankstown Bunker on TV.\nThe Bankstown Bunker was on a TV show called Burke's Backyard. Don Burke hosted the episode from inside the bunker. To get inside the bunker he used the secret passageway."}

{"id": "73644", "revid": "1123157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73644", "title": "Coldplay", "text": "Coldplay is an English rock band formed in London in 1996. The band's members are vocalist/pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bass player Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion. Coldplay became famous around the world with their 2000 song \"Yellow\". Their first album, \"Parachutes\", was very successful and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Coldplay were nominated for this award again in 2003 and 2005. Coldplay is one of the most successful bands of the 21st century, selling over 90 million records worldwide. The band is also known for hit singles, including \"Speed of Sound\" and the 2 Grammy Award-winning songs, \"Clocks\" and their 2008 single \"Viva la Vida\" (Song of the Year for 2008).\nHistory.\nColdplay, is an English alternative rock band, formed in London in 1996-1997. Chris Martin, and Jonny Buckland, were looking forward to form a band while at University College London. After forming Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as the bass guitarist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as a drummer and backing vocalist who plays various instruments, making the band's lineup complete. Phil Harvey was the group's manager from 1998 to 2001. The band finally changed their name to \"Coldplay\" in 1998. Tim Rice-Oxley was to be added to the lineup, but he refused as he was already a member of Keane. The band later recorded and released three EPs; \"Safety\" in 1998, \"Brothers &amp; Sisters\" as a single in 1999 and \"The Blue Room\" in the same year. The Blue Room was their first release on a major record label, after signing to Parlophone.\nColdplay's early material was compared to acts such as Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, U2, and Travis. They had achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single \"Yellow\" in 2000, followed by their debut album \"Parachutes\" released in the same year, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" (2002), won multiple awards, including \"NME\"'s Album of the Year. Their next release, \"X&amp;Y\", received a slightly less enthusiastic yet still generally positive reception upon its release in 2005. The band's fourth studio album, \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely favourable reviews, earning several Grammy nominations and wins.\nSince the release of \"Parachutes\", Coldplay have drawn influence from other sources, including Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Kate Bush, George Harrison and Muse on \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for \"X&amp;Y\" and Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine on \"Viva la Vida\". Coldplay have been an active supporter of various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group have also performed at various charity projects, such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, Sound Relief, , and the Teenage Cancer Trust.\nFormation and first years (1996\u20131999).\nChris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London (UCL) in September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the college year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at Oxford, to be the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. The band's lineup was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums, despite having no previous experience. The band finally settled on the name \"Coldplay\" which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group. By 1997, Martin had also met then Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During a weekend on Virginia Water, they asked each other to play off their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already operational. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets.\nIn 1998, the band released 500 copies of the \"Safety EP.\" Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track \"Brothers &amp; Sisters EP\", which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.\nAfter completing their final examinations, Coldplay signed to Parlophone for a five-album contract in the spring of 1999. After making their first appearance at Glastonbury, the band went into studio to record a third EP titled \"The Blue Room\". Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October, and the single \"Bigger Stronger\", received BBC Radio 1 airplay. The recording sessions for \"The Blue Room\" were tumultuous. Martin kicked Champion out of the band but later pleaded with him to return, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands such as U2 and R.E.M., Coldplay decided that they would operate as democracy, and that profits would be shared equally. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used hard drugs.\n\"Parachutes\" (1999\u20132000).\nAt first, the band planned to record their debut album in the space of two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and April\u2013May 2000. In March 1999, Coldplay began work on their debut album, recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson, although the majority of Parachutes' tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios. The band worked in three studio rooms at Parr Street, and tracked much of the album in one of these rooms\u2014the project studio which Nelson describes as \"basically a demo room\". The album was mixed by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. Coldplay's record label had originally intended to use a mixing engineer for the tracks they picked as singles, but eventually hired Brauer to work on all songs for the album. During that period, they played on the Carling Tour, which showcased up-and-coming acts.\nAfter releasing three EPs without a hit song, Coldplay charted into the Top 40 with the lead single from \"Parachutes\", \"Shiver\". Released in March 2000, it reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. June 2000 was a pivotal moment in Coldplay's history: the band embarked on their first headlining tour, including a showing at the Glastonbury Festival. The band also released the breakthrough single \"Yellow\". The song shot to number four on the UK Singles Chart and placed Coldplay in public consciousness. \"Yellow\" and \"Shiver\" were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000. The former was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000. In the United States, the song was released as the lead single off the then-untitled debut album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets.\nColdplay released their first studio album, \"Parachutes\", on 10 July 2000 in the United Kingdom by their record label, Parlophone. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was released on 7 November 2000 by record label Nettwerk in North America. The album has been made available on various formats since its initial release; both Parlophone and Nettwerk released it as a CD in 2000, and it was also released as a cassette by newfound US label Capitol in 2001. In the following year, Parlophone issued the album as an LP. The band released a limited-edition CD of \"Trouble\", the third single off the album, which features a remix of \"Yellow\". It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists. Both \"Yellow\" and \"Trouble\" earned regular radio airplay in the UK and US.\n\"Parachutes\" was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in September 2000. Having found success in Europe, the band set their sights on North America, released the album there in November 2000, and started the \"U.S. Club Tour\" in February 2001. Although \"Parachutes\" was a slow-burning success in the United States, it eventually reached double-platinum status. The album was critically well-received and earned a Best Alternative Music Album honours at the 2002 Grammy Awards. Chris Martin claimed after the release of \"Parachutes\" the album's success was intended to achieve the band's status as the \"biggest, best band in the f...ing world.\"\n\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" (2002\u20132004).\nAfter the success of \"Parachutes\", Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", once again with Ken Nelson producing. The band started recording the album in London a week after the September 11 attacks in the United States. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. \"In My Place\" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album following a \"strange period of not really knowing what we were doing\" three months after the success of Parachutes. According to Martin \"one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming.\"\nThe band wrote more than 20 songs for the album. Some of their new material, including \"In My Place\" and \"Animals\", was played live while the band were still touring \"Parachutes\". The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website. The album was released in August 2002 and spawned several popular singles, including \"In My Place\", \"Clocks\", and the ballad \"The Scientist\". The latter was inspired from George Harrison's title track to \"All Things Must Pass\", which was released in 1970.\nColdplay toured from June 2002 to September 2003 for the \"A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour\". They visited five continents, including co-headlining festival dates at Glastonbury Festival, V2003 and Rock Werchter. Many concerts showcased elaborate lighting and individualised screens reminiscent of U2's \"Elevation Tour\" and Nine Inch Nails' \"Fragility Tour\". During the extended tour, Coldplay recorded a live DVD and CD, \"Live 2003\", at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion.\nIn December 2003, readers of \"Rolling Stone\" chose Coldplay as the best artist and the best band of the year. At that time the band covered The Pretenders' 1983 song \"2000 Miles\" (which was made available for download on their official website). \"2000 Miles\" was the top selling UK download that year, with proceeds from the sales donated to Future Forests and Stop Handgun Violence campaigns. \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards. At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Coldplay earned Record of the Year for \"Clocks\".\n\"X&amp;Y\" (2005\u20132006).\nColdplay spent most of 2004 out of the spotlight, taking a break from touring while recording their third album. \"X&amp;Y\" was released in June 2005 in UK and Europe. This new, delayed release date had put the album back into the next fiscal year, actually causing EMI's stock to drop. It became the best-selling album of 2005 with worldwide sales of 8.3 million. The lead single, \"Speed of Sound\", made its radio and online music store debut on 18 April and was released as a CD on 23 May 2005. The album debuted at number one in 20 countries worldwide, and was the third-fastest selling album in UK chart history. Two other singles were released that year: \"Fix You\" in September and \"Talk\" in December. Critical reaction to \"X&amp;Y\" was less enthusiastic than that of its predecessor, with \"New York Times\" critic Jon Pareles describing Coldplay as \"the most insufferable band of the decade\" Comparisons between Coldplay and U2 became increasingly common, although critical reaction to the album was still largely positive. Chris Martin later revealed that the negative remarks made him feel \"liberated\".\nFrom June 2005 to July 2006, Coldplay went on their \"Twisted Logic Tour\", which included festival dates like Coachella, Isle of Wight Festival, Glastonbury and the Austin City Limits Music Festival. In July 2005, the band appeared at Live 8 in Hyde Park, where they played a rendition of The Verve's \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" with Richard Ashcroft on vocals. In September, Coldplay recorded a new version of \"How You See the World\" with reworked lyrics for War Child's \"\" charity album. In February 2006, Coldplay earned Best Album and Best Single honours at the BRIT Awards. Two more singles were released during 2006, \"The Hardest Part\" and \"What If\". The sixth and final single, \"White Shadows\" was released in Mexico during June 2007.\n\"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" (2008\u20132009).\nIn October 2006, Coldplay began work on their fourth studio album, \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\", with producer Brian Eno. Taking a break from recording, the band toured Latin America in early 2007, performing in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. After recording in churches and other venues in Latin America and Spain during their tour, the band said the album would likely reflect Hispanic influence. The group spent the rest of the year recording with Eno.\nMartin described \"Viva la Vida\" as a new direction for Coldplay: a change from their past three albums, which they have referred to as a \"trilogy\". He said the album featured less falsetto as he allowed his voice's lower register to take precedence. Some songs, such as \"Violet Hill\", contain distorted guitar riffs and bluesy undertones. \"Violet Hill\" was confirmed as the first single, with a radio release date of 29 April 2008. After the first play, it was freely obtainable from Coldplay's website from 12:15\u00a0pm\u00a0(GMT\u00a0+0) for one week (achieving two million downloads), until it became commercially available to download on 6 May. \"Violet Hill\" entered the UK Top 10, US Top 40 (entering the Top 10 in the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart) and charted well in the rest of the world. The title track, \"Viva la Vida\", was also released exclusively on iTunes. It became the band's first number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and their first UK number one, based on download sales alone.\nOn 15 June 2008, \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" topped the UK album chart, despite having come on the market only three days previously. In that time, it sold 302,000 copies; the BBC called it \"one of the fastest-selling records in UK history\". By the end of June, it had set a new record for most-downloaded album ever. In October 2008, Coldplay won two \"Q\" Awards for Best Album for \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" and Best Act in the World Today. The band followed up \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" with the \"Prospekt's March\" EP, which was released on 21 November 2008. The EP features tracks from the \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" sessions and, as well as being available on its own, was issued as a bonus disc with later editions of \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\". The song \"Life in Technicolor II\" was released as a single on 9 February 2009.\nIn June, Coldplay began their \"Viva la Vida Tour\" with a free concert at Brixton Academy in London. This was followed two days later by a 45-minute performance that was broadcast live from outside BBC Television Centre. \"Lost!\" became the third single from the album, featuring a new version with Jay-Z. Coldplay performed the opening set on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief at the Sydney Cricket Ground and then played a sold-out concert later that same night. Sound Relief is a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland Floods.\nIn 2009, Coldplay was nominated for four BRIT Awards: British Group, British Live Act, British Single (\"Viva la Vida\") and British Album (\"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\"). At the 51st Grammy Awards in February 2009, Coldplay won three Grammy Awards in the categories for Song of Year for \"Viva la Vida\", Best Rock Album for \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\", and Best Vocal Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Viva la Vida\".\nOn 15 May 2009, Coldplay released a live album, entitled \"LeftRightLeftRightLeft\" which was recorded at various shows during the tour. \"LeftRightLeftRightLeft\" was to be given away at the remaining concerts of their \"Viva la Vida\" tour. It was also released as a free download from their website.\n\"Mylo Xyloto (2009\u20132011)\".\nColdplay finished recording the new album in 2011. The band finished recording the new album in mid-2011. \nOn 19 October 2011, Coldplay performed songs at an event for Steve Jobs, including \"Viva la Vida\", \"Fix You\", \"Yellow\" and \"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\". On 26 October their concert in Spain, was streamed by YouTube as a live webcast. On 30 November 2011, Coldplay received three Grammy Award nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards. On 12 January 2012, Coldplay were nominated for two Brit Awards. On 21 February 2012, they were awarded the Brit Award for Best British Group for the third time. The album was the best-selling rock album in the UK in 2011, selling 908,000 copies. The album's second single, \"Paradise\", was also the best-selling rock single in the UK, selling 410,000 copies. At the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September, \"Paradise\" won the award for Best Rock Video. \"Mylo Xyloto\" has sold over 8 million copies.\nMusical style.\nColdplay's musical style has been defined as alternative rock, being compared to Radiohead and Oasis. Lead singer Chris Martin once proclaimed the band's music as \"limestone rock\". The band's music has been called \"meditative\" and \"blue romantic\"; it \"reflects on their emotions\" and Martin \"endlessly examines his feelings\". Martin's lyrical wordplay has been called feminist, similar to Andrew Montgomery of Geneva.\nThe tone of the band's first studio album, \"Parachutes\", was described as melodic pop with \"distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion\". It was also described as being \"exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive\". In a review for \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", the songs were considered to contain \"lush melodies and a heartbreak\" and that they had a \"newfound confidence.\" The music on \"X&amp;Y\" has been considered to be \"ruminations on Martin's doubts, fears, hopes, and loves.\" Coldplay acknowledge the Scottish alternative rock band, Travis, as a major influence on their earlier material.\nIn \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\", the group's style was moving towards art rock, experimenting with different instruments such as tack pianos, and even what Will Champion described as a \"very crude\" variant of Spanish flamenco clapping. \"Prospekt's March\" moved towards a more conservative style but maintained some of their experimental styles from the previous album.\nColdplay's musical style and image has also been satirically described as \"bland\", with its members representing the \"faces of radical beige\" (a neutral color). University College London's satirical newspaper, \"The Cheese Grater\", featured a mock article in February 2010, following the arrest of UCL student Abdulmutallab on charges of terrorism, in which they declared that \"Bland, middle class rock band was not monitored, admits University College. Were Coldplay made 'radically ...' at UCL?\"\nActivism and commercial endorsements.\nDespite Coldplay's worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for some product endorsements. In the earlier years, Coldplay turned down multimillion-dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs \"Yellow\", \"Trouble\", and \"Don't Panic\" respectively. According to lead singer, Chris Martin, \"We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that.\" The song \"Viva la Vida\" was featured in a commercial for the iTunes Store, advertising its exclusive availability of the single as a digital download on iTunes. Additionally, Chris Martin appeared at an Apple Inc. Special Event on 1 September 2010, playing a number of songs, and also thanked Apple for their assistance in marketing \"Viva la Vida\". Coldplay supports Amnesty International. Martin is regarded as one of the most visible celebrity advocates for fair trade, supporting Oxfam's ongoing Make Trade Fair campaign. He has been on trips with Oxfam to assess conditions, has appeared in its advertising campaign, and is known for wearing a \"Make Trade Fair\" wristband during public appearances (including at Coldplay concerts). The band were also filmed for Make Poverty History, clicking their fingers.\nDuring the early years, Coldplay became widely known in the media for giving 10 percent of the band's profits to charity, which they continue to do. Bass guitarist Guy Berryman said, \"You can make people aware of issues. It isn't very much effort for us at all, but if it can help people, then we want to do it.\" The band also asks that any gifts intended for them are donated to charity, according to a response on the FAQ section of Coldplay's website. Martin spoke out against the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and endorsed the United States Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama in 2004 and 2008 respectively.\nIn June 2009, Coldplay began supporting Meat Free Monday, a food campaign started by Paul McCartney which attempts to help slow climate change by having at least one meat free day a week.\nFrom 17-31 December 2009, Coldplay auctioned a quantity of significant band memorabilia, including their first guitars. Proceeds went to Kids Company, a charity which helps vulnerable children and young people in London. A month later in January 2010, Coldplay performed a slightly modified version of \"A Message\", entitled \"A Message 2010\", at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon special, raising money for the victims of the Haitian Earthquake."}

It is caused by parasites from the species \"Trypanosoma brucei\".\nPeople get African trypanosomiasis from the tsetse fly. Because of this, it is most common in certain areas of Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, where the tsetse fly lives. Researchers say that about 70 million people, in 36 countries, are at a high risk for getting sleeping sickness. As of 2010, sleeping sickness had caused around 9,000 deaths per year (compared to 34,000 in 1990). \nIn 2013, about 30,000 people had African trypanosomiasis. Also, about 7,000 more people were getting the disease every year. More than 80% of these people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nMedications can treat African trypanosomiasis. The treatment is usually done in a hospital, because the drugs have many side effects. For sleeping sickness that was not treated early, the medications used for treatment are based on arsenic, a poison. These medications are dangerous, and about 5% of people die from taking them. \nThe best way to protect against African trypanosomiasis is to protect against insect bites. \nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of African trypanosomiasis happen in two stages.\nThe hemolyphatic phase.\nCommon symptoms in this stage include:\nIf African trypanosomiasis is not treated at this point, the parasite will also get into the circulatory system and defeat the body's natural defenses. If this happens, the person can have:\nThe neurological phase.\nThis phase begins when the parasite invades the central nervous system by passing through the blood\u2013brain barrier. \nIn this stage, one of the most common symptoms is trouble sleeping. This is where the name \"sleeping sickness\" comes from. People in this stage often cannot sleep normally, and may be up all night and then sleep during the day.. \nOther symptoms in this stage can include:\nWithout treatment, a person with African sleeping sickness will go into a coma; (thus the name) all their important organs will stop working; and they will die.Damage caused in the neurological phase cannot be fixed."}

They bite vertebrates, and drink their blood. They are the insect vectors of some serious diseases.\nThey have been studied a lot because they can spread sleeping sickness and other diseases.\nThe genus \"Glossina\" has about 34 species in three groups of species. One group of species lives out on the savannah; another group lives near rivers, and the third group lives in tropical forests.\nLife cycle.\nTsetse have an unusual life cycle. Female tsetse only fertilize one egg at a time and keep each egg in their uterus while the offspring develops internally during the first larval stages. During this time, the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus. \nIn the third larval stage, the tsetse larva finally leave the uterus and crawl into the ground. There it forms a hard outer shell and becomes the pupa. It completes its metamorphosis into an adult fly. This takes twenty to thirty days, while the larva relies on stored resources. \nNormally, insect larvae feed themselves before pupation, but tsetse development (before it emerges as a full adult) occurs without feeding. The development is based only on nutritional resources provided by the female parent, which shows how blood is a rich source of nutrition. The female must get enough energy for her needs, for the needs of her developing offspring, and to store the resources which her offspring will require until it emerges as an adult.\nControl of the fly.\nBefore the 20th century, people and their cattle simply did not live in areas infested with tsetse flies. In the 20th century, using pesticides after World War II caused as many problems as it solved. Now more subtle methods are preferred. Tsetse flies can be trapped by using large blue cloths as a lure. Another good method is to release irradiated male flies, which are sterile. Since females mate only once in their lives, that much reduces the population."}

People make puns in order to make other people laugh. Many jokes are actually puns. A pun usually uses a word which can have more than one meaning, even if the spelling is different: \nSometimes a pun may use a whole phrase that can be heard in more than one way, as in the following knock-knock joke:\n(The last sentence is supposed to mean: \u201cThis was the way I used to speak before I got my false teeth\u201d).\nThere is a joke about a man who sent ten different puns to friends in the hope that at least one of the puns would make them laugh. Unfortunately, no pun in ten did.\n(The joke here is on \u201cno pun intended,\u201d which is said when a person unintentionally says a pun by coincidence, and announces the find ).\nThere are many websites and books which have jokes, very often with puns.\nPuns are easier to make in some languages than others. Languages with many homophones (words which sound the same but have a different meaning) such as the Chinese language are most suitable for puns.\nPuns do not have to be about homonyms. They can sometimes be a double entendre using both a literal sense of the word and a metaphor (figurative use). For example, if a young man joins the Navy and someone says that he \"sailed through his exams\", this is a joke because: 1) the expression \"to sail through something\" means \"to do it easily\", but 2) the Navy is about sailing in ships. It is possible to say something like that without realizing that it is a pun. \nAnother example is a story about two boys growing up and eating more and more food. One of the parents just began a new job and the other says, \"I hope you can start bringing home the bacon!\" In this example, bacon is a play on words meaning both money and the food, bacon. \nMany British people love making puns, especially bad puns (where a word has to be mispronounced to make the joke work). Lewis Carroll made many puns in his books \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Alice through the Looking Glass\".\nThese are also a few examples of different puns:\nReally \"cool\" music as the rock band plays on an iceberg,\n\"You're fired!\" as the man is shot from a gun.\n\"How is your vineyard doing?\" a neighbor asked. The woman replied, \"It's growing grape!\" (play on words: \"It's going great!\""}

To provide more power at high altitude, the B, C, D, and H versions had a Packard-built version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine instead of the Allison engine used in the P-51A. The Packard Merlin engine featured a more advanced supercharger, allowing much better performance above 15,000 feet when compared to the Allison. The P-51D version had a \"bubble\" canopy, or one unobstructed by metal supports. After World War II, it was used in the Korean War as a dive bomber and was used by many Central American air forces until the 1970s. Today, P-51 Mustangs are often used in air races."}

First elected at the 1951 general election as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD for County Clare, he remained in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann until 1973. During this time he served as: \nHe was Ireland's first European Commissioner, serving for three years until he became President in 1976. He never faced an election, because both time he ran for president he was unopposed.\nEarly &amp; private life.\nPatrick John Hillery, known as \"Paddy Hillery\", was born in Spanish Point, Miltown Malbay, County Clare in 1923. He attended University College Dublin, where he studied medicine. In 1947 he returned to his home town where he followed in his father\u2019s footsteps as a doctor. As a doctor he also spent a year working as coroner for West Clare.\nHillery married Mary Beatrice (Maeve) Finnegan on 27 October 1955. Together they had a son, John, and a daughter, Vivienne, who died after a long illness in 1985, shortly before her eighteenth birthday.\nDomestic political career.\nHillery was asked by \u00c9amon de Valera to be his running mate in the 1951 general election. He won the election and Hillery was successful on his first attempt to get elected. He only became a minister after de Valera retired as Taoiseach in 1959.\nGovernment minister: 1959-1973.\nAs Minister for Education, Hillery established comprehensive schools and Regional Technical Colleges.\nAfter another election win in 1969 Hillery became Minister for External Affairs (renamed Foreign Affairs in 1972), one of the top cabinet posts. After \"Bloody Sunday\"), he travelled to the United Nations in New York to demand UN involvement in peace-keeping on the streets of Northern Ireland. In 1972, he negotiated Irish membership of the European Economic Community, a process that was completed in 1973.\nEuropean Commissioner.\nFollowing Ireland's successful entry into Europe Hillery was rewarded by becoming the first Irishman to serve on the European Commission. He was appointed Vice-President of the Commission as well as having special responsibility for Social Affairs. Hillery's most famous policy was to force EEC member states to give equal pay to women.\nIn 1976 the new Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party National Coalition Government of Liam Cosgrave said they would not re-appoint him to the Commission. He thought about returning to medicine, perhaps moving with his wife, Maeve (also a doctor) to Africa. When President Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh resigned, Hillery agreed to become the Fianna F\u00e1il candidate in the election.\nPresident.\nHe was elected without a contest as the only candidate, becoming President of Ireland on 3 December 1976.\nAfter 1982 people thought he was a very good and honest President. Before then he had been written off as boring and dull. In 1982 the Taoiseach, Fine Gael's Garret FitzGerald, lost a vote in D\u00e1il Eireann. Dr Fitzgerald asked for a general election. As President he did not have to agree, and Dr Fitzgerald would have had to resign. This meant D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann might choose Charles Haughey as Taoiseach. Hillery thought a new election was best, but many people from the President's own party tried to persuade him otherwise.\nPresident Hillery refused to speak to any opposition party politicians, but when Charles Haughey, who was Leader of the Opposition, had rang the President's Office he \"threatened\" to end the career of the army officer answered and refused on Hillery's \"explicit\" orders to put the call through to the President. Hillery called the Irish Army's Chief of Staff the following day and as Commander-in-Chief of the Army had ordered the Chief of Staff to make sure that no politician ever interfered with the career of the young army officer.\nIn 1983 Hillery was again elected unopposed. Hillery left office in 1990 (he had served the maximum two terms), widely applauded for his integrity, honesty and devotion to duty. However he re-entered public life in 2002 during the second referendum on the Nice Treaty, when he urged a \"yes\" vote. The referendum was carried.\nHillery: a foreign assessment.\nIn 2002, state papers released by the British Public Record Office under the 'Thirty Year Rule' and published in the Irish media, revealed how Hillery was viewed. A briefing paper, prepared for then British Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Home and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland William Whitelaw, observed about Hillery:"}

They are the second most common bird species kept as a pet. Cockatiels can live from 10 to 25 years, depending on how healthy their lifestyle is, although wild cockatiels usually live shorter. \nCockatiels have tiny feathers on their head called a crest. The crest allows the owner to have an idea of what they are feeling; straight up if scared or excited, flat when they're angry, and slightly curved is normal/happy.\nIn the wild, cockatiels are prey animals, meaning there are predators that eat them. As a result, cockatiels can scare easily, especially when they meet someone or something they do not know. With enough patience and affection, an owner can tame the cockatiel and help them get over their natural fear. Like many other parrots, cockatiels are very good at climbing, and use their beak to position themselves each time.\nCockatiels come in many different colours, some naturally while others were specifically bred. Gray is considered to be their original colour, and is one of the most popular, along with Lutino (yellow). Males have a brighter crest and face, and sing louder and more frequently than females. A cockatiel has very long tail feathers compared to other birds.\nSeeds make up most of their diet, but veterinarians strongly recommend various fruits, vegetables, and beans as well. However, a few of these may be harmful to them, and it is advised to be cautious with what they eat. It can be very hard to get adults to try new foods, so it is best to have them try little by little at a time instead of all at once.\nLike other birds, they can be taught to do many tricks; including flips, handshakes, fly-on-command, showing their wings, and more. Patience and repetition is key, as teaching one trick can take many months. They can also be taught to sing, but may become confused and ruin the song if it's too complex.\nCockatiels are social birds, and like to spend time with others. They can become overly attached to their owners over time (especially if raised young), and may start to shriek when they feel lonely. If the owner is unable to spend a lot of time with them, getting them a partner (preferably another cockatiel) can help resolve their clinginess.\nCockatiels are Australian psittacines native to the deserts (Forshaw, 2010).\nThey are genetically adapted to high temperatures, amid centuries of domestication\nCarvalho, T.S.G., et al. \u201cBehavior of Cockatiels (Nymphicus Hollandicus) at Two Temperatures in\nCaptivity.\u201d \"Arquivo Brasileiro De Medicina Veterin\u00e1ria e Zootecnia\", vol. 67, no. 6, 2015, pp. 1669\u20131674., doi:10.1590/1678-4162-7892."}

ArmaLite. The fact that the AR-17 is a shotgun gives lie to a common belief that AR stands for \"ArmaLite Rifle.\" \nThe military version is the M-16, manufactured by Colt Firearms, FNMI, Harrington Richardson, Daewoo, and others. \nThe AR-15 is a semiautomatic rifle that discharges a single shot with each pull of the trigger until empty. The M16 and M4, unlike the AR-15, is a select fire (semi and fully automatic) magazine fed, gas operated, shoulder fired assault rifle. The M-16 first saw combat in the Vietnam War. \nPerformance.\nEarly usage of the M16 version of the AR-15 in Vietnam resulted in intense criticism of poor reliability. On-scene studies revealed that the barrel and chamber tended to accumulate rust pits in the humid conditions in Vietnam that caused difficult extraction of fired cartridge cases. Chrome plating of the barrels and chambers solved the problem and the M16 has gone on to great approval. While the early AR-15s also were built with un-chromed barrels the moderate climate in the US and gentler use by owners resulted in few problems.\nFirst considered of little use, the AR-15 was considered to provide inferior accuracy to target shooters in the prestigious Service Rifle matches. The use of heavier match barrels and target sights by ArmaLite and heavier match bullets by the Sierra Bullet company produced accuracy so good that they have displaced the previous M1 and M16 rifles used in those matches. \nThe AR-15s light weight, accuracy, and light recoil has made it extremely popular with shooters and its use is spreading around the world. It is a useful collector's item, ranch or home security rifle, and small caliber hunting rifle and has become one of the most popular rifles in the world, and ArmaLite's are manufactured even today. \nDesign.\nThe AR-15 is a lightweight, magazine-fed, air-cooled rifle with a rotating locking bolt actuated by propellant gas expanding within an internal gas piston operating system. It can be made in many different \"styles\" shooting many different types of ammunition such as the 9mm bullet that is most often used in handguns. \nThe gas for this system is tapped from the barrel and travels down a gas tube that feeds it into the bolt carrier and thus the gas (i.e. piston) cylinder. The gas expands within the piston cylinder and forces the carrier rearward. A cam pin linking the bolt to unlocking surfaces of the bolt carrier forces the bolt to unlock from the barrel and allows the assembly to drive to the rear. \nAn error in an early article covering the AR-15 described the system as a \"direct impingement\" system. This long standing error is based on the fact that a true direct impingement system also moves propellant gasses from the barrel into the face of the carrier. Unlike pressurizing a piston cylinder in the bolt carrier, the gas of the direct impingement system simply passes into a shallow depression in the bolt carrier and actually blows the carrier to the rear. \nBarrels of current commercial variants of the AR-15 are produced in chromed, un-chromed, and stainless steel barrels with little extraction difficulty in the more moderate climate in the US. \nEven the earliest AR-15 and M16 internal piston systems were chromed plated and the rifles performed well if properly lubricated and cleaned. Nonetheless some rifle manufacturers have accused the internal piston system of inferiority and modified the rifles to an external piston system and driving rod pushing the carrier. \nTwo such designs were developed for the military and found unneeded. Extreme test firing (2000 rounds with no cleaning or lubing and no malfunctions) confirmed findings that simple lubrication keeps the rifles functioning for extreme periods, but all manufacturers recommend more frequent cleaning.

{"id": "73723", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73723", "title": "Timpani", "text": " \nTimpani (sometimes called kettle drums) are drums that are made out of large bowls that are usually made of copper shaped by craftsmen, which after being tuned, have a skin-like material stretched over the top. This material used to be a type of vellum or treated skin, but modern drums use a synthetic material. This top section is known as the \"drumhead\". \n\"Timpani\" is an Italian word. It is also a plural of the word \"timpano\". However \"timpano\" is rarely used in informal English. More often, a timpano is referred to as a \"drum\", a \"timpani\", or simply a \"timp\". Someone who plays a timpani is called a \"timpanist\".\nDifference from other drums.\nTimpani are different from other drums because they are tuned to certain musical notes. A timpanist will often describe the drum as being \"in voice\" (or out of voice, as the case may be) when it is correctly tuned. To play it, it is hit with a special drumstick or \"timpani mallet\". Other drums that are used in orchestras and bands make a sound rather than a note, and are not tuned. A player normally sits with a group of two, three or four timpani around him, which is why the name timpani is in the plural. \nBrief history.\nTimpani were originally used in official bands. They can still be seen in the bands of the modern official as in the Household Cavalry of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, in which the \"kettle drums\" (as they are called) are carried by large drumhorses. In the 1700s timpani became popular in orchestral music, and can be heard in the music of Handel, Beethoven and other 19th century composers wrote music that needed the timpani. Nowadays all large orchestras have timpani, and some bands that play popular music use them as well.\nDifferent ways timpani can be made.\nThe drumhead.\nA timpani drumhead, also called a timpani head, can be made out of two different things. Some are made out of animal skin, like calfskin or goatskin. Other ones can be made out of thick plastic. Because plastic heads are hard to break and do not cost as much as animal skin heads, they are used more often than animal skin heads. However, a lot of professional players prefer skin heads because they think that skin heads make a better sound when they are hit. The drumhead is stretched over the bowl of the timpani and held on by screws for tuning the timpani. \nTuning the timpani.\nThe screws that hold and tune the drumhead are called \"tension rods\". To tune the timpani, the \"tension rods\" can all be tightened or loosened. The timpani makes a higher sound if the tension rods are made tighter, and a lower sound if they are loosened. There are usually around seven tension rods on the timpani. \nMachine timpani.\nTuning a timpani by turning every tension rod by itself can be very hard, so some timpani makers invented different ways to change the drum's pitch more quickly. \nChain timpani.\nIn a chain timpani, the tension rods are all attached to a chain. This chain is hooked up to a lever, and when a player moves the lever back and forth, it tightens and loosens all the screws at the same time to change the pitch of the drum. \nPedal timpani.\nA pedal timpani is a timpani that uses a pedal to change its pitch. It is the kind of timpani that is used the most today. A player can push on the pedal to make the timpani play higher notes, or let the pedal come back up to play lower notes. There are three different kinds of pedal timpani:\nTimpani mallets.\nTimpani are played with a special kind of drumstick called \"timpani mallets\". A player uses two mallets at a time when they play the drum. The two parts of the mallet are called the \"shaft\" and the \"head\". The head is the part of the mallet that is shaped like a circle, and is the part that hits the timpani, and the shaft is the wooden part of the mallet that is held by a timpanist. A timpani mallet's head can be made out of many things, but is usually made out of a wood sphere that is covered with felt or a thin cloth. The shaft of the mallet is usually made out of wood, like hickory, cherry, or bamboo, but can also be made out of metal, like aluminum. Some timpani mallets do not have a felt head, and just have a wooden one. These mallets are sometimes used in classical and baroque music.\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, some mallets had shafts made out of whale bones and heads made out of sponges.\nTechniques.\nWith a pedal timpani, a player can produce different sound effects using the pedals. Performing glissando on timpani demands switching the pedals. Glissando is generated by pressing the pedal during the vertebra. Furthermore it is possible to play glissando at any volume level up or down. For example, Alexander Rahbari, an outstanding Iranian-Austrian composer used glissando effect produced by switching timpani pedals in the opening of his piece, Persian Mysticism Around G, where the player moves from Bb up to C and then rolling down to G(see the timpani part on right below).

It formed in the Bay of Campeche off the east coast of Mexico where it quickly strengthened into a hurricane. It made landfall in central Mexico early on September 28 as a Category 1 hurricane.\nStorm history.\nOn September 21, an area of convection formed in the western Caribbean Sea associated with a trough of low pressure. Convection increased and a wide area of low pressure formed on September 22 as the convection moved northwestward towards the Yucatan Peninsula. On September 23 the area of low pressure moved over the Yucatan Peninsula and was creating thunderstorms from the southern Gulf of Mexico to the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Over the next few days the large area of low pressure was moving unevenly over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, but convection was restricted from strong upper-level winds. By September 25 upper-level winds started decrease as conditions became more favorable for tropical cyclone formation and by that morning visible satellite imagery showed that a tropical depression could be forming about 180 mi (290 km) east of Tampico, Tamaulipas.\nDuring the evening of September 25 a United States Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft found that the area of low pressure had turned into a tropical depression. The depression tracked slowly to the south and southwest into the Bay of Campeche. On September 26, convection increased and the depression was getting closer to strengthening into a tropical storm. At 0300 UTC September 27 the Government of Mexico gave out a tropical storm watch for parts of the Mexican Gulf Coast as the depression was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. The depression began to quickly strengthen on September 27, and the depression became Tropical Storm Lorenzo around midday. Continued strengthening that afternoon brought Lorenzo to hurricane strength, less than seven hours after being named. Lorenzo made landfall in central Mexico south-southwest of Tuxpan as a Category 1 hurricane with 80 mph winds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Lorenzo dissipated later that afternoon as the final advisory was given out.\nPreparations.\nA tropical storm warning was given out for the central Mexican Gulf Coast on September 26. When Lorenzo began to rapidly strengthen, the warning was raised to a hurricane warning. Mexico's Civilian Protection officials declared a \"red alert\" for much of the state of Veracruz.\nAt first, no evacuations were given out right away, as a result of the up-coming start of Lorenzo, although shelters were set up in the state of Veracruz and officials cancelled classes at all local schools. Because of the fast development of the storm though, officials quickly evacuated over 100,000 people just before landfall by using bullhorns on the streets warning people of the up-coming threat.\nPemex oil production continued in spite of the threat of the system and its offshore impacts. Nonetheless, the price of oil increased to record highs of $83.90 a barrel from the concerns by investors about possible damage.\nImpact.\nModerate damage was reported in east-central Mexico as Lorenzo hit the area. Shacks were badly damaged by the strong winds, a lot of tree damage was reported and many areas lost electricity service. Flooding was also reported as rivers quickly rose from the heavy rain and wet ground. Scattered landslides were also reported. The area was already cleaning up after Hurricane Dean, which hit the area in late August.\nHeavy rain was the cause to at least five deaths; which included a woman and two children in Chiconcuautla in Puebla's Sierra Norte region, and a senior citizen who fell into a hole near his home in P\u00e1nuco, Veracruz."}

She had been an academic, barrister, and member of the Irish senate from 1969 to 1989.\nShe defeated \"Fianna F\u00e1il's\" Brian Lenihan and Fine Gael's Austin Currie in the 1990 presidential election, the first time Fianna F\u00e1il had lost a presidential election.\nShe resigned the presidency four months ahead of the end of her term of office to begin a five-year term in the United Nations, as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2002 Robinson became Honorary President of Oxfam International. She signed the Yogyakarta Principles in meeting of International Commission of Jurist and from 2008 to 2010 she was the predident of the International Commission of Jurists. \nIn 2018 Robinson became embroiled in the \"proof of life\" controversy surrounding \"The Missing Princess\"(Latifa) the imprisoned daughter of the current Dubai ruler, Sheikh Maktoum. She had attended a lunch in Dubai, hosted by Latifa's step mother, Princess Haya the then, junior wife of Maktoum, in which Robinson appeared in staged photographs with Princess Latifa and publicly claimed that Latifa was being cared for by her loving family. In February 2021 Robinson retracted her former statement in a BBC Panorama broadcast, claiming that herself and Haya had both been misled and had been spun convincing and elaborate lies about Princess Latifa's alleged medical 'bipolar' history and condition.\nBackground.\nBorn Mary Therese Winifred Bourke in Ballina, County Mayo in 1944, Mary Robinson was the daughter of two medical doctors. The Bourke family has been in Mayo since the thirteenth century. One ancestor was a leading activist in the Irish National Land League in Mayo and the Irish Republican Brotherhood; an uncle, Sir Paget John Bourke, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II after a career as a judge in the Colonial Service; while another relative was a Roman Catholic nun.\nRobinson got the permission of the then Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid to study in Trinity College, Dublin (TCD); at the time Roman Catholics were forbidden by church rules from studying in TCD without special permission, called a dispensation. TCD once did not allow Catholics to study. In her twenties, she was appointed Professor of Law in the college.\nCareer in Seanad \u00c9ireann.\nShe was elected one of Trinity College's three members of Seanad \u00c9ireann in 1969.\nShe fought:\nShe was also on several Senate/Oireachtas committees:\nIn 1982, the Labour Party entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael. Many expected Robinson to be the attorney-general, but the Labour party leader instead picked an unknown, new senior counsel called John Rogers. Shortly afterwards, Robinson resigned from the party in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement, she said that unionist politicians in Northern Ireland should have been consulted as part of the deal.\nRobinson decided not to seek re-election to the senate in 1989. One year later she agreed to become the first Labour candidate for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.\nPresidential election.\nCandidates from other parties.\nThe main opposition party, Fine Gael was no well organised. They gambled that former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald would run as its candidate (but for two years he had been saying no), then they asked Peter Barry, who had previously been willing to run but had run out of patience and was no longer interested. The party's third choice was the former civil rights campaigner Austin Currie, a new TD and former minister in Brian Faulkner's power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland from 1973-1974.\nFianna F\u00e1il chose T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Defence, Brian Lenihan. Lenihan was popular and widely seen as humorous and intelligent. Like Robinson he had made liberal policy reforms. In the 1960s he abolished censorship, for example. He was seen as a near certainty to win the presidency. The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second.\nBut Taoiseach Charles Haughey of Fianna F\u00e1il was not popular, and the Labour Party leader Dick Spring was becoming more popular.\nElection Campaign.\nDuring the campaign people found out that what Lenihan had told friends in private showed he had lied in public about the 1982 dissolution of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\nLenihan denied he had pressured the President but then a tape was produced of an 'on the record' interview he had given to a postgraduate student the previous May where he talked about trying to apply pressure. Lenihan claimed that \"on mature recollection\" he had not pressured the President and had been confused in his interview with the student. But the government threatened to fall over the issue.\nLenihan was dismissed as T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Defence.\nLenihan still managed to win the first count. In the Single Transferable Vote system Austin Currie was eliminated and his second choice votes were counted. Most were for Robinson. Lenihan became the first Fianna F\u00e1il presidential candidate in the history of the office to lose a presidential election. Robinson now became President.\nPresidency.\nRobinson was a popular president, before he died in 2002 Brian Lenihan said that she was a better president than he ever could have been. She often visited Britain, and became the first Irish president to visit Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. She welcomed visits by senior British royals, most notably the Prince of Wales to \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in. On one trip to Belfast she met with the local MP, Gerry Adams, the President of Sinn F\u00e9in. Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who was leader of the Labour Party, privately advised her not to meet Adams. However the Government did not formally advise her not to meet with him, so she felt it would be wrong,not to meet the local member of parliament during her visit, and was photographed publicly shaking his hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all parties, including David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.\nCharles Haughey died not like her, even stopping her from delivering the important BBC Dimbleby Lecture. Haughey's successors as Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds (Fianna F\u00e1il: 1992-94), John Bruton (Fine Gael: 1994-97) and Bertie Ahern (Fianna F\u00e1il:1997- ) never hid their admiration of her work. Bruton and Ahern both tried to get her the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\nRobinson became the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 12 September 1997, resigning the Presidency a few weeks early with the approval of Irish political parties in order to take up the post. Newspaper reports say that she had been asked by Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan to become a public campaigner\nRobinson was the first High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Tibet, making her trip in 1998. During her tenure she criticised the Irish system of permits for non-EU immigrants, and criticised the United States' use of capital punishment. Though she had initially announced her intention to serve a single four-year period, she extended the term by a year following an appeal from Annan, allowing her to preside over the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban, South Africa, as Secretary-General. Robinson's posting as High Commissioner ended in 2002.\nTrinity College.\nMrs Robinson is the twenty fourth, and first female, Chancellor of University of Dublin.\nThe Elders.\nOn 18 July 2007 in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela, his wife Gra\u00e7a Machel, and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and honesty to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. Nelson Mandela announced the formation of this new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on his 89th birthday.\nArchbishop Tutu will serve as the Chair of The Elders. The founding members of this group also include Gra\u00e7a Machel, Kofi Annan, Ela Bhatt, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter, Li Zhaoxing, Mary Robinson and Muhammad Yunus.\nThe Elders will be independently funded by a group of Founders, including Richard Branson, Peter Gabriel, Ray Chambers; Michael Chambers; Bridgeway Foundation; Pam Omidyar, Humanity United; Amy Robbins; Shashi Ruia, Dick Tarlow; andThe United Nations Foundation.\nAs president she signed two very important Bills that she had fought for throughout her political career\nAdditional reading.\nOther source material.\nMedia coverage in \"The Irish Times\", \"The Irish Independent\", \"The Examiner\" (now renamed the \"Irish Examiner\"), \"The Star\", The Irish Mirror, \"The Irish Sun\", \"Sunday Tribune\", \"The Sunday Independent\", \"The Sunday Times\", \"The Times\", \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"The Guardian\". Also briefing notes issued on various occasions (notably state, official or personal visits by Robinson abroad) supplied by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Buckingham Palace, \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, the Holy See and the press offices of the United Nations (including the text of her Romanes Lecture in November 1997).

The United States government forced Native Americans to leave their lands and move outside the United States. The U.S. then took over the Native Americans' lands and made the United States bigger.\nBecause thousands of Native Americans died during this forced move, it is called the \"Trail of Tears.\"\nReasons.\nIn 1827, gold was found near Dahlonega in Georgia. This resulted in a gold rush. But at that time, a Native American nation called the Cherokees lived in Georgia. Many Cherokee children went to American schools. The Cherokees had their own newspaper and built three-story houses. Some even owned slaves. \nEven so, President Andrew Jackson wanted this land to belong to the United States. The land was worth over $7,000,000 (about $179.5 million in 2015 U.S. dollars). Jackson signed a law that forced the Cherokees to move. This was called the Indian Removal Act. However, at that time, the Cherokees had their own nation and their own government. They did not have to follow laws made by the United States. Therefore, Jackson signed laws that let him take nearly all the Cherokees' rights.\nThe Cherokee nation did not want to accept those laws or the Indian Removal Act, so the Cherokees' Chief John Ross decided to try to defend the Cherokee rights through the United States courts. In 1832, the Supreme Court of the United States said that the Cherokee were living in their own country, \"in which the laws of Georgia can have no force.\" The Court said Georgia had no right to make the Cherokee do anything.\nNevertheless, the U.S. government used a treaty, called the Treaty of New Echota, to remove the Cherokee nation by force. The treaty was signed by the leader of a small group of Cherokees who had different opinions than the rest of the Nation. Since the treaty was not signed by an official Cherokee leader, it was not legal under Cherokee law. About 15,000 Cherokees signed a petition against the treaty. Newspapers and people around the United States (including John Quincy Adams) protested the treaty.pp.\u00a036, 41 The United States Senate approved the treaty by just one vote. President Jackson signed the treaty into law on May 23, 1836. The treaty gave the Cherokees two years to leave their lands.p.\u00a036\nForced removal.\nThe deadline for Cherokees to leave their land voluntarily was on May 23, 1838.p.\u00a036 President Martin Van Buren sent General Winfield Scott to lead the soldiers who would force the Cherokee to leave.p.\u00a041 Scott ordered his soldiers to \"show every possible kindness to the Cherokee and to arrest any soldier who [gave] a [cruel] injury or insult [to] any Cherokee man, woman, or child.\"\nOn May 26th, the operation began. 7,000 soldiers forced about 15,000 Cherokees and 2,000 of their slaves to leave their land. All Cherokees had to leave their homes right away. Within three weeks, the Cherokees were all forced into internment camps. They were forced to stay in these camps for the summer of 1838.pp.\u00a041\u201342 353 Cherokee died from dysentery and other diseases.\nFinally Chief Ross got General Scott to agree to a deal. Chief Ross promised that he and other Cherokee leaders would bring the Cherokee people to their new lands on their own. General Scott agreed and even got the U.S. Army to pay the costs for the trip.\nThe Cherokee travelled in groups of 1000 to 3000 people on three main routes. Different groups started in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Guntersville, Alabama; and Charleston, Tennessee. Most Cherokees had to walk; others, if they were wealthy men, could use wagons. The United States government also gave the Cherokee about 660 wagons.\nThe trip was about 1,200 miles long. During the trip, the Cherokees had to deal with winter weather, blizzards, and diseases. Not everybody agrees on how many people died on the trip. Some say 2,000 and others say 6,000, but most say about 4,000 people died. This was one out of every four people in the Cherokee population. They died from diseases like pneumonia, from freezing to death, from drinking bad water, and from other causes. About half of them died in camps, and the other half during the trip.\nIt is said that many Cherokees sang a Cherokee version of the song Amazing Grace, which became a kind of anthem for the Cherokee nation.\nFinally the Cherokee who were still alive arrived in what is now Oklahoma.\nRoutes.\nThere were different routes the Cherokees took. Some were by land and others by water. Some boats were destroyed, which was a danger on water routes. On the ground, people had to walk through mud and cold weather and it was harder walking on land.\nWater route.\nThis route was taken by three groups, in total 2,800 Cherokees. The first group left on June 6 and reached the territory after 13 days. All groups started at Ross's Landing at the Tennessee River. They used boats to travel to the Ohio River. They then took this river southward, which took them to the Mississippi River. From there they moved through the Arkansas River westwards. They arrived near Fort Coffee, Oklahoma. The second and third group had a lot of problems with diseases, so their trip took longer.\nLand routes.\nAll others took land routes. They traveled in groups with a size of 700-1,600 people, all led by conductors chosen by John Ross, except for those, who signed the Treaty of New Enchota. They were led by United States soldiers. They usually took the southern route, and John Ross' groups the northern route. Both sides used already existing \"roads\". Most Cherokees took the northern route. The route lead through central Tennessee, southwestern Kentucky, and southern Illinois. The groups crossed the Mississippi north of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, then traveled through southern Missouri and west of Arkansas. Many died because of diseases, lack of water and bad road conditions. All land routes usually ended near Westville, Oklahoma. There were many more different land routes only taken by few people. These routes cover more than 2,200 miles in 9 states."}

For example, Sam Wang is also a member of 183 Club. Tony Sun and Zax Wang are actors in many television programmes, while Jason Hsu has been in many promotional campaigns.\nHistory of 5566.\nBefore They Were a Band.\nEach of 5566's members has had some success before joining to make one band.\nTony Sun had released some solo albums in Taiwan dialect in the 1990s. They were quite well received. He was even called the \"Taiwanese little champion.\" However, his lost a bit of popularity when he had to do military service.\nZax Wang was a member of POSTM3N.\nSam Wang was a national soccer player and a model. He is a member of another Taiwanese boyband, 183 Club.\nJason Hsu was at first \"obese and unpopular in high school\". However, he started appearing in several CMs when he lost weight.\nDebut.\nIn 2002, 5566's first appearance and sudden rise to popularity has been a controversial topic. They showcased their multiple talents in their first interview, yet their hard work was not respected, drawing lots of criticism and earning them a negative nickname, \"Turkey.\" Their first TV series \"My MVP Valentine\" aired on local television, starring the band as the lead roles. The show exceeded expectations by having a higher viewership rating than several drama shows at the time. Not only did this drama help skyrocket 5566 to fame, it was also the driving force behind the careers of Angela Zhang and Johnny Yan.\nDue to a serious injury while filming a variety show, Rio Peng temporary pulled out from group activities to recover. Although the remaining 5566 members confirmed that Peng was still part of the group, Peng eventually left, forming his own management company, Wingman Entertainment.\nIn December of the same year, 5566 released their first album, which sold 240,000 copies in Taiwan. Because the album was re-released in two additional versions, 5566 became infamous for regularly repackaging their albums. This holds true till today; \"Westside Story OST\" and \"Top of the Forbidden City OST\" are the only two albums that remain unrepackaged.\nControversy.\nThe members of the band are said to have disrespectful behaviour. The band has also been accused of having \"most of their songs\" as cover versions, \"showing no originality and no talent in their song-writing.\" On the Internet, many debates have been created surrounding the band.\nSome believe that the controversy was created to increase media attention and fame.\nDiscography.\n5566 have released the following Mandarin-language albums:"}

Fahrenheit has been a great success around Asia, particularly in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. The group has four members: Calvin Chen, Jiro Wang, Wu Zun and Aaron Yan. They record albums with HIM International Music record label.\nHistory.\nBackground and Members.\nThe name Fahrenheit comes from each of the members representing a season or temperature matching their different personalities. Calvin Chen represents spring, warmth; Jiro Wang represents summer, hot; Wu Zun represents autumn, cool; and Aaron Yan represents winter, cold. Each of the four members also has a temperature symbolising them on the Fahrenheit scale: Calvin is at 77 degrees, Jiro is at 95 degrees, Wu is at 59 degrees and Aaron is at 41 degrees.\nWu was born and raised in Brunei for most of his life, later graduating at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia. He was entered the entertainment business while on a trip to Taiwan, when a television producer discovered him during this trip and recommended him to play the lead male role of Tokyo Juliet, which he accepted.\nAaron moved to New York, United States at a young age but later returned to Taiwan for high school and college at Chinese Culture University. Around early 2005, Comic producers had been searching for good bloggers on the Internet. They discovered him, who at that time, was popular online, and thus recommended him to go casting for a role in a TV show.\nAfter Calvin finished high school in Taiwan, he studied in university in Canada, where he completed his master's degree in Economics at University of Victoria. He then further continued his life in Vancouver by joining the pageant-like competition Sunshine Boyz, where he won first place with a free ticket to Taiwan and a contract with a music company, as well as a role in a TV drama.\nJiro graduated in Taiwan's Fu-Shin College. He was first asked to join the entertainment industry from a singing competition. But he failed to release an album because of company difficulties, so he decided to continue his career in the industry by working backstage, mainly in fashion designing and modeling. He was approached again around 2004, when his acting career began.\nAlthough unsure at first, Fahrenheit first gained great fame around 2005 when all of the members first starred in the series KO One on television in Taiwan. Because it felt awkward to have only three members in a boyband, Wu Zun joined the group later in late 2005. On 28 December 2005, Fahrenheit officially became a quartet boy band."}

Her mother, Emily Maude Tayler (maiden name McVeagh), was a nurse.\nAlfred Tayler and his wife moved to Kermanshah, Iran. He started a job there as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia. Doris was born here in 1919. Later, the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia (now called Zimbabwe) in 1925 to farm maize.\nLessing studied at the Dominican Convent High School in Salisbury (now Harare). It was a Roman Catholic convent school for girls. She left school aged 14, and taught herself after that. She left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading about politics and sociology and began writing around this time. In 1937, Lessing moved to Salisbury to work as a telephone operator. She soon married her first husband, Frank Wisdom. They had two children (John and Jean), before the marriage ended in 1943. She took care of future author Jenny Diski after her parents abused her. Diski lived with Lessing for four years in London.\nAfter her divorce, Lessing became more involved with members of the Left Book Club. She had joined this communist book club the year before. She met her second husband, Gottfried Lessing there. They married soon after she joined the group, and had a child named Peter. This marriage ended in divorce in 1949. Gottfried Lessing later became the East German ambassador to Uganda. He was murdered in the 1979 rebellion against Idi Amin Dada.\nShe went to London to pursue her writing career and communist ideals. Lessing left two young children with their father in South Africa. Peter, from her second marriage, went with her. She later said that she thought she had no choice at that time. She felt she had done the best she could and that she was not the best person to raise the children. She would have been very frustrated like her mother had been because it was diificult for an intelligent woman to spend all of her time with young children.\nArchive.\nThe largest collection of Lessing's writing is at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, at the University of Texas at Austin. There are 45 boxes of Lessing's materials at the Ransom Center that contain nearly all of her available manuscripts and typescripts up to 1999. Lessing kept none of the originals of her early manuscripts. Other institutions, including the McFarlin Library at the University of Tulsa, hold smaller collections.\nDeath.\nDuring the late 1990s, Lessing suffered a stroke which stopped her from travelling during her later years and focused her mind on death. Lessing died on 17 November 2013 at her home in London, aged 94."}

It is about 160\u00a0km south of Baghdad. In 2008, about 900.583 people lived there. The city is the capital of Najaf province. It is one of the seven holy cities of Shia Isl\u0101m. It is the center of Shia political power in Iraq.\nThe city is home to the Imam Ali Mosque, where Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib, the fourth caliph is buried. Shia Muslims consider the mosque to be the third holiest Islamic site.\nH\u0101r\u016bn ar-Rash\u012bd founded the city on the site of Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib's grave in the 8th century.\nNajaf was badly damaged during the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War. In 1991, there was a Shiite uprising in Najaf, which was suppressed by Saddam Hussein. This conflict caused many deaths, there are mass graves around the city. In 2003, a suicide bombing caused widespread damage. 120 people died, including the moderate imam Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim.\nIn April 2004, forces of Muqtada as-Sadr captured the city, as well as the city of Kut. Before the 2004 elections, a part of the occupying forces left the city.\nMosque and seminary.\nThis mosque is the most important Shi'a mosque in Iraq. The city is now a great center of pilgrimage from throughout the Shi'a Islamic world. It is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. Shia Islam's second most important figure is buried in Najaf. the Imam Ali Mosque is considered by Shias as the third holiest Islamic site.\nThe Imam Ali Mosque is housed in a grand structure with a gold gilded dome and many precious objects in the walls. Nearby is the Wadi-us-Salaam cemetery, reputed to be the largest in the world. It contains the tombs of several prophets and many of the devout from around the world aspire to be buried there, to be raised from the dead with Im\u0101m Al\u012b on Judgement Day. Over the centuries, numerous hospices, schools, libraries and Sufi convents were built around the shrine to make the city the centre of Sh\u012b\u02bba learning and theology.\nThe Najaf seminary is one of the most important teaching centres in the Islamic world. Ayatollah Khomeini lectured there from 1964 to1978.\nMany of the leading figures of the new Islamic movement that emerged in Iraq, Iran and Lebanon in the 1970s studied at Najaf."}

It is native to Europe, the Mediterranean region and southern and central Asia. It is a perennial herb. It can grow to 20\u201380\u00a0cm tall. Its leaves are opposite each other. They are 1\u20134\u00a0cm long. The flowers are purple. They can grow 3\u20134\u00a0mm long. The name of the plant comes from the Greek \"origanon\" [\u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd]: oros [\u1f44\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2] \u201cmountain\u201d and the verb \"ganousthai\" [\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9] \u201cdelight in\u201d. \nGrowing oregano for cooking.\nThe subspecies of oregano \"Origanum vulgare hirtum\" is an important herb. It is used for cooking, especially in Turkish cuisine and Italian cuisines. The leaves are used for cooking.\nOregano is often used for tomato sauces, fried vegetables and grilled meat. Together with basil, it adds much to the special character of many Italian dishes.\nOregano is an ingredient needed for Turkish cuisine. It adds flavour to the Turkish choban salad. It can be used separately. It can also be added to the lemon-olive oil sauce that goes with almost every fish or meat barbecues and some casseroles.\nOregano has an aromatic, warm and slightly bitter taste. The taste varies in intensity; good quality is so strong that it almost numbs the tongue, but the cultivars adapted to colder climates have often unsatisfactory flavour. The influence of climate, season and soil on the composition of the essential oil is bigger than the difference between the various species.\nThe related species \"Origanum onites\" (Turkey, Asia Minor) and \"O. heracleoticum\" (Italy, Balkan peninsula, West Asia) have similar flavours. A closely related plant is marjoram from Asia Minor. That plant has a completely different taste. This is because phenolic compounds are missing in its essential oil. Some breeds show a flavour intermediate between oregano and marjoram. The Oregano plant is also commonly found in the mediterranean region, and the black sea."}

{"id": "73985", "revid": "590442", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73985", "title": "Basil", "text": "Basil (\"Ocimum basilicum\") ( or ) is a plant of the Family Lamiaceae. It is also known as Sweet Basil or Tulsi. It is a tender low-growing herb that is grown as a perennial in warm, tropical climates. Basil is originally native to India and other tropical regions of Asia. It has been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years. It is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world. Some of them are Italian, Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisines. It grows to between 30\u201360\u00a0cm tall. It has light green, silky leaves 3\u20135\u00a0cm long and 1\u20133\u00a0cm broad. The leaves are opposite each other. The flowers are quite big. They are white in color and arranged as a spike. \nThe plant tastes somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent, sweet smell. Basil is very sensitive to cold. It is best grown in hot, dry conditions. While most common varieties are treated as annuals, some are perennial, including African Blue and Holy Thai basil. \nThe word \"basil\" comes from the Greek \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 (\"basileus\"), meaning \"royal\". This is because it is believed to have grown above the spot where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" quotes speculations that basil may have been used in \"some royal unguent, bath, or medicine\". Basil is still considered the \"king of herbs\" by many cookery authors. An alternative etymology has \"basil\" coming from the Latin word \"basilicus\", meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk, but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece.\nBasil for cooking.\nMost of the time, Basil should be used fresh. In recipes it is generally added at the last moment. Cooking it quickly destroys the meal. The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator. Using a freezer will allow for it to be kept a longer time. In both cases, it needs being blanched quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavour, and what little flavour remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavour, like hay.\nMediterranean and Indochinese cuisines frequently use basil. In Mediterranean cuisines it is often combined with tomato. Basil is one of the main ingredients in pesto\u2014a green Italian oil-and-herb sauce from the city of Genoa. The other two main ingredients of Pesto are olive oil and pine nuts. The most commonly used Mediterranean basil cultivars are \"Genovese\", \"Purple Ruffles\", \"Mammoth\", \"Cinnamon\", \"Lemon\", \"Globe\", and \"African Blue\". Chinese also use fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods. In Taiwan, people add fresh basil leaves into thick soups (\u7fb9\u6e6f; g\u0113ngt\u0101ng). They also eat fried chicken with deep-fried basil leaves.\nBasil is sometimes used with fresh fruit and in fruit jams and sauces. Most commonly this is done with strawberries, but also raspberries or dark-colored plums. Some people say that the flat-leaf basil used in Vietnamese cooking is more suitable for use with fruit.\nBasil seeds.\nWhen soaked in water the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous. They are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as falooda or sherbet. Such seeds are known variously as \"sabja\", \"subja\", \"takmaria\", \"tukmaria\", \"falooda\", or \"h\u1ed9t \u00e9\". They are used for their medicinal properties in Ayurveda, the traditional medicinal system of India.\nother types.\nSeveral other basils, including some other \"Ocimum\" species, are grown in many regions of Asia. Most of the Asian basils have a clove-like flavour that is generally stronger than the Mediterranean basils. In China, the local cultivar is called \u4e5d\u5c64\u5854 (\"ji\u01d4c\u00e9ngt\u01ce\"; literally \"nine-level pagoda\"), while the imported varieties are specifically called \u7f85\u52d2 (\"lu\u00f3l\u00e8\") or \u5df4\u897f\u91cc (\"b\u0101x\u012bl\u01d0\"), although [\u5df4\u897f\u91cc] often refers to another different kind plant\u2014parsley.\n'Lemon basil' has a strong lemony smell and flavour very different from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called citral. It is widely used in Indonesia, where it is called \"kemangi\" and served raw, together with raw cabbage, green beans, and cucumber, as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, broken up, are a zesty salad condiment.\nGrowing Basil.\nBasil grows well in hot weather. It behaves like an annual if there is any chance of a frost. In Northern Europe, the northern states of the U.S., and the South Island of New Zealand it will grow best if sown under glass in a peat pot. It can be planted out in late spring/early summer, when there is little risk of frost. It fares best in a well-drained sunny spot.\nAlthough basil will grow best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot. Like most herbs, it will do best on a south-facing windowsill (in the Northern Hemisphere). It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts. It grows best in strong sunlight. A greenhouse or cloche is ideal if available. Basil plants can even be grown in a basement, under fluorescent lights.\nIf its leaves have wilted from lack of water, it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location. Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant needs more sunlight or less fertilizer.\nIn sunnier climates such as Southern Europe, the southern states of the U.S., the North Island of New Zealand, and Australia, basil will thrive when planted outside. It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States, but dies out when temperatures reach freezing point, to grow again the next year if allowed to go to seed. It will need regular watering, but not as much attention as is needed in other climates.\nBasil can also be propagated very reliably from cuttings in exactly the same manner as \"Busy Lizzie\" (Impatiens), with the stems of short cuttings suspended for two weeks or so in water until roots develop.\nIf a stem successfully produces mature flowers, leaf production slows or stops on any stem which flowers, the stem becomes woody, and essential oil production declines.To prevent this, a basil-grower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature. Because only the blooming stem is so affected, some can be pinched for leaf production, while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds. \nOnce the plant is allowed to flower, it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds. These can be saved and planted the following year. Picking the leaves off the plant helps \"promote growth\", largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems.\nDiseases.\nBasil suffers from several plant diseases that can ruin the crop and reduce yield. Fusarium wilt is a soilbourne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants. Seedlings may also be killed by Pythium damping off. \nA common foliar disease of basil is gray mold caused by \"Botrytis cinerea\", can also cause infections post-harvest and is capable of killing the entire plant. Black spot can also be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the fungi genus \"Colletotrichum\".\nHealth issues.\nBasil, like other aromatic plants such as fennel and tarragon, contains estragole, a known carcinogen and teratogen in rats and mice. While human effects are currently unstudied, the rodent experiments indicate that it would take 100\u20131000 times the normal anticipated exposure to become a cancer risk.\nCultural aspects.\nThere are many rituals and beliefs associated with basil. The French call basil \"herbe royale\". Jewish folklore suggests it adds strength while fasting. It is a symbol of love in present-day Italy, but represented hatred in ancient Greece, and European lore sometimes claims that basil is a symbol of Satan. African legend claims that basil protects against scorpions, while the English botanist Culpeper cites one \"Hilarius, a French physician\" as affirming it as common knowledge that smelling basil too much would breed scorpions in the brain.\nHoly Basil, also called 'Tulsi', is highly revered in Hinduism and also has religious significance in the Greek Orthodox Church, where it is used to prepare holy water. It is said to have been found around Christ's tomb after his resurrection. The Serbian Orthodox Church, Macedonian Orthodox Church and Romanian Orthodox Church use basil (Macedonian: \"\u0431\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043a\"; Romanian: \"busuioc\", Serbian: \"\u0431\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0459\u0430\u043a\") to prepare holy water and pots of basil are often placed below church altars.\nIn Europe, they place basil in the hands of the dead to ensure a safe journey. In India, they place it in the mouth of the dying to ensure they reach God. The ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks believed that it would open the gates of heaven for a person passing on. \nIn Boccaccio's \"Decameron\" a memorably morbid tale (novella V) tells of Lisabetta, whose brothers slay her lover. He appears to her in a dream and shows her where he is buried. She secretly disinters the head, and sets it in a pot of basil, which she waters with her daily tears. The pot being taken from her by her brothers, she dies of her grief not long after. Boccaccio's tale is the source of John Keats' poem \"Isabella or The Pot of Basil\". A similar story is told of the Longobard queen Rosalind."}

It is an international winter sports event that was held from February 7 to February 23, 2014. The host city was Sochi in Russia. It was chosen on July 4, 2007, during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Guatemala City, Guatemala. This was Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympics (the Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow though). These were also the first winter games in a subtropical city.\nSports.\nFifteen winter sports were played in the 2014 Winter Olympics program. Sports included were ones that are generally played in the winter. They include skiing, ice skating, ice hockey, and curling. A total of twelve new events was contested to make it the largest Winter Olympics to date. The following sports were played:\nStadiums.\nMost of the stadiums will be built at a place called Sochi Olympic Park near the Black Sea coast All of the venues(stadiums) being used are new. The venues are near each other. This will provide a great compactness of the concept with the Olympic Stadium and all indoor venues of the Olympics will be gathered within walking distance.\nHoewever, some parts of the Olympics, mainly skiing and snowboarding, will take place away from the main area. These events will take place at Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)\nRosa Khutor Plateau Olympic Village\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the Games was held on 7 February 2014. It was held from 20:14 to 23:02 local time. The Games were officially opened by Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia. There was an audience of about 40,000 people. The performance part of the ceremony was mainly about Russian classical music. The pop duo t.A.T.u performed as well.\nThe site of the opening ceremony was Fisht Olympic Stadium. This was built just for the games. It will be used only for the opening and closing ceremonies. \nHomophobia.\nIn 2013, a law against 'homosexual propaganda' was made in Russia. Cher chose not to perform at the Winter Olympics because of the law.\nOn 27 January 2014, the mayor of Sochi said that there are no gay people living in Sochi.\nOn the first day of the Olympics, 7 February 2014, four gay rights activists were arrested in St Petersburg, including one pregnant woman.\nIncidents and threats.\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ...and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea.\"\nThreats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games."}

{"id": "74079", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74079", "title": "Berlin Blockade", "text": "The Berlin Blockade was from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949. It began when the Soviet Union \"blocked\" railway and road access by the three Western powers (the Americans, British, and French) to the Western-occupied sectors of Berlin. The Blockade stopped after the Western powers used airplanes to airlift food and other things that people needed.\nThe Soviet Union began the blockade because they thought that monetary reform in the three German Occupation zones controlled by the Western powers which started on 21 June 1948 made the western parts of Germany too strong and wanted to force the west out of their occupation zone. \nPostwar division of Germany.\nWhen the Allied Powers met at Potsdam they agreed to divide Germany into four occupation zones, American, British, Soviet, and French. They divided Berlin into four zones as well. Berlin was surrounded by the Soviet occupation zone, so the only way to get to the three western controlled sectors was driving through Soviet-controlled territory.\nCauses.\nThe Soviet Union began the blockade because they thought the western half of Germany (controlled by the UK, USA and France) was becoming too strong, because one currency had recently been introduced throughout the entire western half - the Deutsche Mark. The Soviets were worried that a single currency would help the economy of the western half recovered quickly from the damage caused by the Second World War, and that this stronger western half would eventually develop into a country (it eventually did, called West Germany). The Russians wanted one Germany, without an army, that they could easily control. The Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union had killed one in seven Soviet people, and the Soviets feared that Britain, France and America might try to launch their own invasion at some point in the future. They therefore wanted as much land between them and France as possible, so that any major war would be fought in central Europe, and not in the Soviet Union where Soviet civilians might be killed (which is what had happened during WWII). \nGermany also has lots of coal and iron near its border with France. The Soviets wanted to use the coal and steel to help rebuild their own country, but these resources woudl be difficult to access if the western half of Germany turned into a capitalist country that was allied to Britain, France, and the USA. If Germany was a single neutral country, gaining access to these resources would be easier because Germany could be bullied by the Soviet Union.\nBerlin airlift.\nOn 24 June 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access to the three Western-held sectors of Berlin. They cut off all rail and road routes going through Soviet-controlled territory in the United States. They also blocked routes by river and canal to the Baltic Sea. The Western powers had arranged a treaty with the Soviets guaranteeing the right to use the roads, railways and waterways.\nThe commander of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, wanted to send some tanks along the Autobahn from West Germany to West Berlin, with instructions to fire if they were stopped or attacked. President Truman said no, because that may start a war. Clay was told to ask General Curtis LeMay, commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, to see if an airlift was possible. General Albert Wedemeyer, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, was in Europe when the blockade began. He had been commander of the American forces in India and China in 1944\u201345. He knew about the Allied airlift from India over \"The Hump\" of the Himalayas to China. He was in favour of starting an airlift.\nThe first flight of the airlift was thirty-two C-47 cargo planes on 26 June 1948. They carried 80 tons of cargo including milk, flour, and medicine.\nSo many things had to be flown into Berlin that aircraft took off every three minutes. If an aircraft missed its landing place it could not fly around the airfield and try again, it had to return to its base. This was easier and safer than holding up the aircraft following behind.\nThe Americans also recruited ex-Luftwaffe aircraft mechanics to help with maintenance, when the Allies realised that the blockade was going to last longer than the expected three weeks.\nBritish, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and South African pilots flew in the airlift. The French were fighting in their colonies in South-East Asia and could not spare many aeroplanes for the airlift. Instead they built a new and larger airport in its sector, on the shores of Lake Tegel. They completed the building in less than 90 days. Today it is the Berlin-Tegel International Airport.\nHundreds of aircraft, nicknamed \"Rosinenbomber\" (\"raisin bombers\") by Berliners, were used to fly in a wide variety of cargo, ranging from large containers to small packets of candy with tiny individual parachutes intended for the children of Berlin, were flown out of Berlin on return flights.\n278,228 flights were made, and 2,326,406 tons of food and supplies, including more than 1.5 million tons of coal, were delivered to Berlin.\nThe USSR lifted its blockade at midnight, on 11 May 1949. But, the airlift did not end until 30 September 1949, because the Western states wanted to build up enough supplies in West Berlin in case the Soviets blockaded it again.\nThe three major Berlin airfields involved were Tempelhof, in the American Sector, RAF Gatow in the British and Tegel in the French. To keep everything safe, air traffic control was located at Tempelhof. A new four-power organization also started, Berlin Air Safety Center (BASC). BASC only closed down in 1990, when Germany was reunited and the ordinary German civilian air traffic control took over.\nBritish operation.\nThe British had about 150 C-47 Dakotas and 40 Avro Yorks. The RAF was also using 10 Short Sunderlands and later by Short Hythe flying boats. These flew Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to the Havel river. The flying boats were designed to resist rust and water damage so were very useful for transporting bulk salt, which would have rusted the other planes. Many other aircraft were later used, and the British had flown in about 100,000 tons of cargo by the end of the blockade.\nMonument.\n39 British and 31 U.S. pilots died during the blockade. There is a monument with their names in front of Tempelhof airport. Similar monuments can be found at the military airfield Wietzenbruch near Celle and at Rhein-Main Air Base\nAfterward.\nTegel was developed into west Berlin's principal airport, and by 2007 had been joined by a redeveloped Berlin-Schoenefeld in Brandenburg. As a result of these two airports Tempelhof has been closed, whilst Gatow no longer serves as an airport and now hosts the Museum of the German Luftwaffe. During the 1970s and 1980s Schoenefeld had had its own crossing points through the Berlin Wall for western citizens."}

The lancelets are usually said to be the sister group of the craniates.

In Asia, they are harvested commercially as food for humans and domesticated animals. They are an important object of study in zoology as they give indications about the origin of vertebrates.\nRelationships.\nLancelets serve as an intriguing comparison point for tracing how vertebrates have evolved and adapted. Although lancelets split from vertebrates more than 520 million years ago, their genomes hold clues about evolution, particularly how vertebrates have employed old genes for new functions. They are regarded as similar to the archetypal vertebrate form.\nThe genome of the Florida lancelet (\"Branchiostoma floridae\") has been sequenced. \"Most authors regard amphioxus as the closest relative of the Vertebrata on the basis of 10\u201315 [morphological] features that are not seen in tunicates\"."}

She had two children. Her first child died shortly after being born, and G\u00f6ldin was accused (and sentenced) for killing it. She later worked for a physician from Glarus, Jakob Tschudi, who was one of the richest and most influential people in the Canton of Glarus. When she worked there, small needles were found in the milk for one of the daughters of Tschudi. Additionally, Tschudi's relatives claimed that the daughter had spewn nails on several occasions.\nFor this reason, G\u00f6ldin was accused of bewitching Tchudi's daughter. Under torture, she confessed that she had used the powers of the Devil. On 13 June 1782, she was sentenced to die by the sword, but the verdict did not mention witchcraft. The execution followed soon afterwards. After the execution, the paper trail was destroyed. Despite these efforts, the case created an uproar in other parts of Switzerland and in Germany because the public saw G\u00f6ldin as an innocent victim.\nWhat may have happened.\nWalter Hauser, a journalist, looked at sources that were not known to date. He thinks G\u00f6ldin might have had an affair with her master, Johann Jakob Tschudin. During this affair, he might possibly have raped her. Adulterers were seen as unfit to hold a public office, at the time. For this reason, Tschudi may have decided to do away with G\u00f6ldi. He initiated the trial for witchcraft, which ended in her execution.\nFilm about her life.\nGertrud Pinkus made a film about Anna G\u00f6ldin's life, in 1992. It is called \"Anna G\u00f6ldin - Letzte Hexe\". In it Cornelia Kempers plays Anna G\u00f6ldin.\nWas she a witch, after all?\nIn March 2007, both the government and the Church of Glarus refused to say Anna G\u00f6ldin had been innocent, 225 years after her execution. They said that in the minds of the people of Glarus, this rehabilitation had already taken place.\nOn 20th September 2007, the Swiss parliament decided that in Anna G\u00f6ldin's case, justice was wrong. Fritz Schiesser, as representative for Glarus in the Swiss parliament, called for Anna G\u00f6ldin's exoneration.

It was the seventh named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Gabrielle formed as a subtropical cyclone on September 8 about 385\u00a0miles (625\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. Wind shear affected the storm for much of its existence, although a brief decrease in the shear allowed the system to strengthen into a tropical storm. On September 9, Gabrielle made landfall on the coast of North Carolina. Turning to the northeast, the storm quickly weakened and died out on September 11. The storm dropped heavy rainfall near its actual landfall location but little precipitation in other areas. Total damage was minor, and there were no reported deaths.\nStorm history.\nA dying cold front moved off the coast of Georgia on September 2 and left behind clouds and showers that moved slowly east. These began to organize, and by late on September 4, the\nthunderstorms had gotten bigger east of the system's center. On September 5, a Hurricane Hunters aircraft reported that the system had not yet become a tropical or subtropical cyclone. A trough caused some wind shear, which stopped the storm from gaining strength. However, the area soon became better for the storm to strengthen.\nThe storm started to develop, about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda. The storm began to turn slowly toward the west-northwest. On September 7, its center became slightly stronger. On September 8, the storm was named Subtropical Storm Gabrielle by the National Hurricane Center. At this time, Gabrielle was about 385\u00a0miles (625\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\nAfter becoming a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle was in an area with cooler air to the north, dry air to the south and west, some wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along the storm's path. These conditions made it so the storm could not strengthen much. However, a curved line of thunderstorms formed in the storm's northern and western sections, and the circulation became better organized. Later, the rainbands died out, leaving the center of the low pressure system far away from the area of thunderstorms. To be a strong tropical cyclone, the center and the thunderstorms need to be located over each other. Soon, the storm began to gain more strength, and it was renamed to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on September 7 while located about 185\u00a0miles (300\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\nWind shear slowly went down as the storm passed over the Gulf Stream, allowing strong thunderstorms to quickly form near the center, and at about 15:45\u00a0UTC, Tropical Storm Gabrielle hit the coast of North Carolina. It had winds possibly as strong as 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) at time. The storm turned to the north and north-northeast, and re-entered the ocean on September 10. Gabrielle weakened to a tropical depression, and still kept scattered thunderstorms near it as it tracked along the northern part of the Gulf Stream. By midday on September 11, Gabrielle died out to the south of Canada. By early the next day, the remnants of Gabrielle were absorbed by another cold front.\nPreparations.\nGabrielle became a subtropical storm. Then, the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm watch from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Oregon Inlet in North Carolina, including the Pamlico Sound. As the storm came close to land, the storm watch for areas south of Cape Fear, North Carolina was taken away. At the same time, a tropical storm warning was declared from Surf City, North Carolina to the North Carolina \u2013 Virginia state border. A tropical storm watch was also issued for parts of the Delmarva Peninsula and Chesapeake Bay.\nBefore the storm arrived, the National Park Service closed visitor centers and campgrounds along the Outer Banks. For about 12\u00a0hours, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was closed down. The governor of North Carolina put rescue teams on standby. Some people were told to tighten down loose objects, and to stay inside when the storm passed over. Because the tropical storm was expected to be minor, no evacuations were ordered. On Ocracoke Island, boats were taken out to prepare for Gabrielle. The threat of the storm made it so a fishing contest was canceled at Atlantic Beach.\nAt first, forecasters, or weather men, were not sure where Gabrielle would go. They said it was possible for the storm to hit areas as far north as New York. Big waves and rip currents were predicted, so the Coast Guard helped to prepare for the storm in the Northeastern United States. On Cape Cod, Massachusetts, a jet airplane flew along the coastline, giving storm advisories to offshore boats. A Coast Guard patrol boat was sent offshore for search and rescue. Sailors were told to be very careful in the storm. However, the storm passed well to the south with little effect.\nImpact.\nBig waves from Gabrielle along the coast of Florida caused a surfer to drown. Around 200 others had to be rescued from the rough seas. People at New Smyrna Beach, Florida said waves reached .\nBy September 9, the outer rainbands of the cyclone began hitting southeastern North Carolina. Constant high winds occurred along coast, reaching 44\u00a0miles per hour (71\u00a0km/h) at Frisco. Wind gusts were sometimes stronger; a gust of 61\u00a0miles per hour (98\u00a0km/h) was recorded at Ocracoke. Along the coast of North Carolina, waves were high. Rip currents caused many swimmers to be rescued by lifeguards. There was not much rain from the storm in most areas, but near the storm's center, 9.03\u00a0inches (229\u00a0mm) of rain fell.\nWhere the most rain fell, some flooding formed. This prevented farmers from harvesting their crops. Much of North Carolina was considered to be in a drought, so people hoped Gabrielle would bring needed water. However, in most locations, no rain occurred. The storm left part of North Carolina Highway 12 on Hatteras Island closed for three hours because of flooding. Other streets in Morehead City and Beaufort were closed. A few buildings in the area had minor damage from the flooding. In Carteret County, the flood waters did $5,000 in damage. Storm surge from Gabrielle was small, at just above normal at Hatteras Island. Overall damage in the state was minor and no people died.\nWhen the storm was called \"Gabrielle\", it was the fourth time that the name was used for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. The name was used previously in 1989, 1995, and 2001. Because Tropical Storm Gabrielle was not bad, the name Gabrielle was not retired and was later used for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season."}

There are four members in the band currently: Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Adrian Young and Tom Dumont. Eric Stefani and John Spence (now dead) were former members. No Doubt was formed in 1986. Their most successful album was \"Tragic Kingdom\", which spawned many singles, including \"Don't Speak\", which was at number-one for sixteen weeks in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Airplay Chart.\nThe band's trademark sound combines ska and reggae with alternative rock, pop, and punk.\nThe band is currently on an hiatus and performed their last shows in 2015. Tony, Tom &amp; Adrian has formed a band called \"Dream Car\" while Gwen Stefani continues to puruse he career as a soloartist.\nHistory.\nNo Doubt formed in 1986 in Anaheim, California, but with the name \"Apple Core\", and with members Gwen Stefani, her brother Eric Stefani, and their friend John Spence. They played several concerts under that name. During one of the concerts, Tony Kanal was there. He was impressed with the band, and became their bassist. He later began dating Gwen (which lasted for seven years.)\nHowever, Spence committed suicide in December 1987. The rest of the band was shocked, and broke up, but reformed a few weeks later because they thought that's what Spence would have wanted. They soon got Tom Dumont as a new guitarist. He was formerly in a band called Rising with his sister. One year later, the band hired Adrian Young as a drummer. When he joined, he said he had been playing the drums for five years, even though he had only been playing for two months.\nThe band released their first album, \"No Doubt\", in 1992. One single was released from it, \"Trapped in a Box\". \nIn 1995 they released their second album, \"The Beacon Street Collection\". It got better reviews than \"No Doubt\" and two singles were released from it.\nOn October 10, 1995 \"Tragic Kingdom\" was released. It was their first album to chart, and it was very successful. It has sold over sixteen million copies.\nOn April 11, 2000 \"Return of Saturn\" was released on Interscope. Four singles were released from it.\nThe band's fifth album \"Rock Steady\" was released December 11, 2001.\nOn 25 November 2003 \"The Singles 1992-2003\" was released. No Doubt made a new song for it, a cover of \"It's My Life\" by Talk Talk. It was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 2005 Grammy Awards.\n\"Everything in Time (B-sides, Rarities, Remixes)\" was released October 12 2004.\nBetween 2004 and 2008 the band's members did things separate from the band. Singer Gwen Stefani released a solo album, \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby\".\nIn 2012 the band released their first studio album in over ten years, \"Push and Shove\". Two singles were released from the album, \"Settle Down\" and \"Looking Hot\"."}

The members of the band are Rob Thomas (vocals, piano), Kyle Cook (guitar), Brian Yale (bass), Paul Doucette (guitar) and Ryan MacMillian (drums). Matt Beck is a live member, playing several instruments in their shows. Adam Gaynor was formerly with the band. He left it in 2005. Their three studio albums have been popular worldwide, and they have sold more than 29 million copies. They are \"Yourself or Someone Like You\", \"Mad Season\" and \"More Than You Think You Are\". They released recently an album with new material and their biggest hits, called \"Exile on Mainstream\".\nHistory.\nFormation (1995).\nRob Thomas, Brian Yale, and Paul Doucette were part of the band Tabitha's Secret, which was based in Orlando, Florida, with fellow members Jay Stanley and John Goff, before splitting to start a new band (what was to become Matchbox Twenty). After recruiting Adam Gaynor from Criteria Recording Studios in Miami and Kyle Cook from the Atlanta Institute of Music, the band named themselves \"Matchbox 20\" and won a recording contract with Atlantic Records.\n\"Yourself or Someone Like You\" (1996\u20132000).\nMatchbox Twenty released their debut album, \"Yourself or Someone Like You\", in 1996. While their first single, \"Long Day\", was a rock radio-only success, the album soon spawned several Top 40 singles throughout 1997 and 1998, including \"Push\", \"3 A.M.\", \"Real World\", and \"Back 2 Good\". \"Push\" and \"3 A.M.\" did not chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart due to the rule in effect prior to 1998 that required a song to be released as a single in order to appear on the Hot 100. \"Real World\" and \"Back 2 Good\" proved to be the band's first entries into the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, after the rule was terminated. The album eventually sold more than 12 million copies in the U.S. alone, achieving a diamond certification. In 1998, Matchbox Twenty recorded a live version of their single, \"3 A.M.\" for release on the charity album \"Live in the X Lounge\", benefiting United Cerebral Palsy research. The band was sued by New Yorker Frank Torres for using his image without his permission on the cover of \"Yourself or Someone Like You\". Torres had been walking down the street when he was asked by a photographer to pose for a picture.\nBefore recording their second album, Rob Thomas collaborated with Itaal Shur on a song called \"Smooth\" for Carlos Santana's comeback album, \"Supernatural\". Thomas was supposed to act only as a songwriter for \"Smooth\", but Carlos Santana had him sing for it after hearing the song's demo. \"Smooth\" was the album's lead single and became a hit in 1999. Thomas won three Grammy Awards for writing and performing on \"Smooth\": Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Popular Music Collaboration with Vocals.\n\"Mad Season\" (2000\u201302).\nDuring 2000, Matchbox 20 renamed themselves to Matchbox Twenty and released their second album, \"Mad Season\". The album, on the strength of several successful singles, including \"Bent\" (which peaked No.\u00a01 on the Hot 100 chart) and \"If You're Gone\", was certified 4x platinum in the United States. The video for \"Bent\" made fun of singer Thomas' increased fame from \"Smooth\" by showing the other band members assaulting him. The next two singles, \"Mad Season\" and \"Last Beautiful Girl\" were not as successful.\n\"More Than You Think You Are\" (2002\u201303).\nFor their third album, \"More Than You Think You Are\", the band revived more of a rock sound. Thomas shared the songwriting efforts with the other band members on several songs. The album again spawned successful singles \"Disease\" (written with Mick Jagger), \"Unwell\", and \"Bright Lights\". The album was not as successful commercially as the previous two, and received mixed reviews from critics. However, the album had an enormous radio presence for well over a year.\nDuring 2003, the band released \"EP\", consisting of six songs. The EP had never before released live and acoustic versions of previously released songs like \"Push\" and \"If You're Gone\", as well as a new track, \"Suffer Me\".\nIn May 2004, the band released a live DVD, \"Show: A Night in the Life of Matchbox Twenty\", filmed in Atlanta and featuring 20 songs, including all of their previous successful singles.\nFirst hiatus and Gaynor's departure (2004\u201307).\nIn February 2005, rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor officially left the group, which had been on hiatus to allow other members to pursue side projects. Rob Thomas released a solo album, \"\u2026Something to Be\", which debuted at No.\u00a01 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album featured four successful singles: \"Lonely No More\", \"This Is How a Heart Breaks\", \"Ever the Same\", and \"Streetcorner Symphony\".\nIn January 2007, Rob Thomas released a single, \"Little Wonders\", which he wrote for the Disney movie \"Meet the Robinsons\".\n\"Exile on Mainstream\" (2007\u201308).\nThe group reunited and began performing during 2007, with the release of their 'retrospective' album \"Exile on Mainstream\", on October 2, 2007. \"How Far We've Come\" was the first single from the new album, which was followed by the second single, \"These Hard Times\". \"Exile on Mainstream\" included four other new songs and a complete collection of all eleven of their previously released singles. The album was also released in the new MVI (Music Video Interactive) format, which included two video interviews discussing the six new songs and eleven greatest hits, plus extras including a photo gallery, U-MYX (to remix \"How Far We've Come\"), buddy icons and wallpapers. \"How Far We've Come\" was released on the band's MySpace page in July 2007, with the video released on September 6, 2007.\nMatchbox Twenty toured during early 2008 with Alanis Morissette and opener Mutemath. The band began their US tour on January 25, 2008, in Hollywood, FL, and concluded in Las Vegas, NV, on March 18, 2008 before heading to Australia and New Zealand, where the Australian band Thirsty Merc was the supporting act. Following Australia, Matchbox Twenty visited the UK for the first time in five years to play six concerts in Cardiff, Wembley, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Manchester. Matchbox Twenty performed at the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup award ceremony.\nSecond hiatus (2008\u201310).\nWhen the band finished touring later during 2008, Rob Thomas began work on his second solo album, \"Cradlesong\". He stated in an interview to \"Billboard\" that he expected that the other members of the band might begin work on Matchbox Twenty's next album without him. At the concert at Mohegan Sun Casino on December 18, 2009, Rob Thomas said that he was not frequently playing Matchbox Twenty songs at his 2009 tour stops because the band was planning to tour together in 2010.\nSecond return and \"North\" (2011\u2013present).\nAt the Taste of Chicago on July 2, 2010, Thomas said that Matchbox Twenty would be recording in the fall for their fourth studio album. On September 4, 2010, while on VH1's Top 20 Music Video Countdown, Thomas stated that Matchbox Twenty was planning to start working on their next studio album in mid-September and that he was 80% sure that the album would be released sometime in 2011. Rob Thomas posted on Twitter that he was \"heading out next week to start writing the new mb20 record\" on September 13, 2010. It was stated on Matchbox Twenty's web site that the next show they will do together is on January 1, 2011 in Oklahoma. According to Paul Doucette, the new Matchbox Twenty album will likely be completed in the beginning of 2012. He explained, \"That's the same question I was asking. We don't know -- the beginning of next year, we hope. It's a real important record for us. We haven't done anything in a long time. The older we get, the more we realize and appreciate the good fortune we have to do what we do at this level. Realistically, how many more times do we get? So we're going to really make this record the one we want it to be.\"\nMatchbox Twenty played a one-off live show in Temecula, California on July 9, 2011, but no new material was played. During the show Rob Thomas stated the show was a \"love letter to our fans.\"\n\"North\" was released on September 4, 2012. The album's first single, \"She's So Mean,\" was released on June 12, 2012.\nIn 2012, the band embarked on a worldwide tour, the North Tour, to promote the album. The tour continued as the 2013 Summer Tour, when they co-headlined with the Goo Goo Dolls."}

{"id": "74195", "revid": "1071818", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74195", "title": "Tetrapod", "text": "Tetrapods (Greek \"tetrapoda\" = four feet) are vertebrate tetrapodomorph land animals. The basic tetrapod plan is four legs and feet. This kind of locomotion is quadrupedal. Amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals are all tetrapods. Even though snakes do not have limbs, they are tetrapods because they evolved from animals with four limbs.\nThe earliest tetrapods evolved from the Sarcopterygii, or lobe-finned fish, into air-breathing amphibians, perhaps in the Upper Devonian period. This means the transition took place in fish, before the land was the main habitat. This is typical of transitional fossils undergoing mosaic evolution.\nEvolution.\nFishapods.\nClear fossil tetrapod tracks from the mid-Devonian predate previous tetrapod records by 18 million years. These tracks are from the Middle Devonian of Poland, dated to nearly 400 million years ago. The footprints were made in the mud of a tropical lagoon, and no animal of that time could have made the tracks except a tetrapod. The find strongly suggests that the animals were fish, not amphibia, when the transition to limbs occurred. The term fishapod is becoming used. They would have been derived from lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii), but of a genus whose body fossil has not yet been found. The Polish team suggest the fish &gt; tetrapod transition might have taken place as early as the Lower Devonian.\nThe earliest tetrapods lived entirely in water. They could not live on land. Earlier, it was believed that fish had first moved onto land \u2013 either looking for food (like modern mudskippers) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out. It was believed that they later evolved legs, lungs, and other body parts to live better on land.\nNine genera of Devonian tetrapods have been described. These earliest tetrapods were not terrestrial. They lived in swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons, brackish river deltas, and even shallow marine sediments. There is much to suggest that these are the kind of environments in which the tetrapods evolved. Also, because fossils of early tetrapods are found widely in the Old Red Sandstone continent, they must have spread by following the coastal lines. This means they could not have lived only in freshwater.\nStill, they may have spent brief periods out of water and would have used their legs to paw their way through the mud. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are known from the early Carboniferous deposits, some 20 million years later.\nTetrapods adapted to terrestrial environments over time and spent longer periods away from the water. They also spent more of their juvenile stage on land before returning to the water for the rest of their life. It is also possible that the adults started to spend some time on land to bask in the sun, close to the water's edge. The first true tetrapods that were adapted to moving on land were small. Only later did they increase in size.\nRomer's gap.\nBetween the lobe-finned fish tetrapods and the first amphibia and amniotes in the Middle Carboniferous lies a gap of 30 million years, with few satisfactory tetrapod fossils. This, noted in the early 1950s by Alfred Romer, is Romer's gap. Some new fossils were found in the 1990s, such as \"Pederpes\", right in the middle of the Romer Gap. The gap still hides details of the transition from fish to tetrapod, but not so much as before.\nSo far, only two fossil sites from the Tournasian (earliest Carboniferous) are known. One is Horton Bluff Formation at Blue Beach, Nova Scotia. Much of this material has not yet been scientifically described.\nThe only other place a Tournasian tetrapod was found is near Dumbarton in the West of Scotland. The articulated (connected) skeleton of \"Pederpes\" was found there. Now comes news of new finds from this formation in five places in the Scottish Borders. The paper describes five new Tournaisian tetrapods, with information about their habitat. \nThe authors say \nApparently, the split between the amphibians and the amniotes came soon after the extinction event as the tetrapods began to recover. \"This accords with most molecular dates for the split, which place it at an average of 355\u2009 my ago, a date only 4\u2009myr after the end-Devonian\".\nThe cleidoic egg.\nWhereas amphibia lay their eggs in water, all other tetrapods (the amniotes) lay cleidoic eggs. These eggs are like private little ponds, protecting and nourishing the embryo until it grows into a hatchling. This was a key evolutionary 'invention', which allowed the amniotes to invade the land. Once the amniotes were truly land animals, there followed a huge adaptive radiation. This was one of the most significant advances in vertebrate evolution.\nStem tetrapods.\nStem tetrapods are difficult to classify because they lack some or all of the key characteristics of the standard groups.\nDescendants of fishapods which at first lived an amphibious life-style. The amniotes and later amphibia are their descendants. Features: able to support their body on land for long periods; had five fingers and toes (pentadactyl limb) in contrast to their fishapod ancestors. Have not yet developed the characteristic features of the main tetrapod groups.\nThe tetrapod clade.\nThe tetrapod clade separated from fish in the Devonian. The amniotes were the earliest to lay cleidoic eggs. The Synapsids (&gt; mammals) and the Sauropsids (&gt; reptiles) are sister clades, and in particular, reptiles did \"not\" give rise to mammals.\nSimple example cladogram.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Warm-bloodedness evolved somewhere in thesynapsid\u2013mammal transition.\u00a0?\u00a0 Warm-bloodedness must also have evolved at one of these points \u2013 an example of convergent evolution.\nLiving tetrapods.\nThere are three main groups of living (\"crown group\") tetrapods. Each group also includes many extinct groups:\nSnakes and other legless reptiles are tetrapods because they are evolved from ancestors who had four limbs. This is also true for caecilians and aquatic mammals.\nClassification.\nA partial taxonomy of the tetrapods:"}

It was made from the story of the Marvel Comics superhero, Spider-Man. It was the first in the \"Spider-Man\" movie series. It was written by David Koepp and directed by Sam Raimi. Tobey Maguire starred as Peter Parker / Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst played the girl Peter loves, Mary-Jane Watson, and Willem Dafoe played the bad guy, Norman Osborn.\nPlot.\nAt the start of the movie, Peter Parker, a very smart teenager, is accidentally bitten by a spider that had been mutated (changed) in a science study. This allows him to climb up walls, make spider webs come from his wrists, jump high, move fast and become very strong. Peter lives with his aunt and uncle. His Uncle Ben teaches him that \"with great power comes great responsibility.\" He uses these powers to win a wrestling competition. However, he does not get paid what he thought he would get paid. A criminal steals a lot of money from the cashier and runs off. Peter does not try to catch the criminal, as revenge for not getting paid as much as he wanted to be. The criminal then steals Ben's car and Ben dies. From then on, Peter becomes Spider-Man and vows to fight crime, using Ben's words to their fullest.\nMeanwhile, Peter's friend Harry's father is in trouble. Norman is the CEO or head of his own company, but the executive board kicks him off. He tests a new kind of formula and becomes the Green Goblin. Norman also has a device that lets him fly around. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin begin to fight in various places. During a fire at a building, the Green Goblin uses his voice and pretends to be someone trapped. When Spider-Man goes to rescue the person, he finds the Green Goblin. During the fight, Spider-Man's arm is cut. Peter, Norman, Harry, Peter's friend Mary Jane Watson, and Peter's aunt then meet at Peter's apartment for Thanksgiving. Norman notices Peter's cut on his arm and realizes that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\nNorman then starts planning to hurt Peter. He scares Peter's Aunt May so badly that she has to go to the hospital. There, Peter realizes that the Green Goblin knows that he likes Mary Jane Watson, so he calls her up, but the Green Goblin has already taken her. Spider-Man goes out to a bridge in New York. The Green Goblin has Mary Jane in one arm and a group of kids in a bus on the other hand. He wants Spider-Man to fail at doing something \u2013 to choose between the person he loves and innocent civilians. He then drops both at once. Spider-Man grabs Mary Jane first and uses his webbing to save the kids. The Green Goblin is angry and attacks Spider-Man. A bunch of New York people start to throw trash and knock the Green Goblin off balance.\nThe Green Goblin then grabs Peter and they start to fight inside an abandoned building. The fight is very violent and Spider-Man starts to bleed. Finally, after Spider-Man knocks the Green Goblin down, the Green Goblin says that he is Norman Osborn. Spider-Man is very surprised. Norman then distracts Peter and talks to him as he tries to get his flying device to move and to kill Peter. Spider-Man ducks at the last second and the flying device impales Norman, killing him. Dying, Norman asks Peter not to tell Harry that he was the Green Goblin.\nThe last scene is at a cemetery for the funeral of Norman. During the ceremony, Harry tells Peter that he swears that Spider-Man will die because Spider-Man killed his father. Mary Jane implies that she loves Peter, but Peter tells her that he will always be a friend and be there for her, and that is all he can give to her.\nProduction.\nA trailer containing original footage was shown for screenings of the 2001 movie . The trailer shows a group of bank robbers flying in a helicopter and land on a giant web between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.

He wrote a book called \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" which has been translated into more languages than any other book except the Bible. The book is a story about a man who is trying to lead a good life as a Christian. It is allegory. The characters in the story represent good things or bad things. Bunyan lived at a time when there was no religious freedom: everybody had to believe what the Church of England told them. Bunyan did not agree with some of the things the Church of England said. He started to preach about his ideas. He was arrested and put into prison because of his beliefs. He wrote \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" while he was in gaol (prison).\nLife.\nEarly years.\nBunyan\u2019s father was a tinker: a metal worker who mends pots and pans. The Bunyan family had been living in Bedfordshire at least since the 12th century. They had gradually lost more and more of their land and had become quite poor. John Bunyan\u2019s father had inherited a small cottage and 9 acres of land. He could not read or write.\nJohn Bunyan only went to school for two, three or four years. He learned how to be a tinker from his father.\nYouth: religious conversion.\nThere was a lot of fighting in England at the time Bunyan was a child. Many people were against King Charles I so there was a Civil War and the king was executed. For several years England was a republic, ruled by Oliver Cromwell. \nWhen Bunyan was 16 years old, he served in the parliamentary army at Newport Pagnell (1644 - 1647). After that, he started to work as a tinker, and in 1649, he married. His wife had two books, both of which were religious books. Bunyan started to be influenced by religion. He became very frightened because he realized he had done things which were wrong, and he wondered whether God would forgive him, so that he would go to heaven when he died, or whether he would be punished and go to hell. The kind of things he did which at that time were thought to be wrong (sins) were not things which would worry many people nowadays: ringing church bells, dancing, playing games on Sundays and, perhaps the worst of all, swearing. Other wrongs he had done in the past included disrespecting his parents, and very likely causing, or at least unremorsefully (unsorrowfully) helping along the early death of his mother and sister - which he did by refusing to take any of the burden or workload at home. It was only for lack of money that he did not spend his time with prostitutes, though he longed to join the gambling and \"painted women\" who attended fairs and other public events. In his book \"Grace Abounding\" Bunyan describes himself as the \u201cChief of Sinners\u201d. He tells how one day he was walking along when he heard a group of women talking to one another about salvation. This made him think about these things.\nIn those days, people were supposed to worship God in the Church of England. There were, however, groups of people who wanted to worship God in different ways. These people were called \u201cnon-conformists\u201d. In 1653, a sect (religious group) of non-conformists had taken over St John\u2019s Church in Bedford. Their vicar was John Gifford. Bunyan discussed the Bible a lot with Gifford.\nBunyan lived in Elstow, near Bedford, until 1655, when his wife died. He moved to Bedford to be nearer to Gifford\u2019s church . He married again in 1659. In 1660, the Restoration of the Monarchy took place: England had a king once more: Charles II became king. It was bad for religious freedom, because all non-conformist meetings were forbidden. St John\u2019s Church had to become part of the Church of England again. Bunyan refused to go to church. He started to preach to groups of people anywhere they could meet: in barns or in the streets. Because he did not have permission to preach, he was arrested and put in gaol. At first, he was sentenced to 3 months, but because he refused to promise to stop preaching, he spent 12 years in gaol.\nYears in gaol.\nBunyan spent the years 1660-1672 in gaol, and again he was in gaol for a short time in 1677. The gaol was at the top of Silver Street in the centre of Bedford, only 5 minutes walk from his house in St Cuthbert Street, which was then on the edge of the town. The gaol had 6 cells and 2 dungeons. He could probably have been free at any time if he had promised to give up preaching, but he did what he firmly believed to be right. He made some money in gaol by making shoelaces. His eldest daughter Mary, who was blind, brought him soup every day and also gave him books to read. Sometimes, he seems to have been let out of gaol for short periods of time. This was not really allowed, but often, the guards might let a prisoner out if they promised to come back. Bunyan even travelled as far as London once, and he must have gone home sometimes because he had two more children by his second wife during that time.\nIt was during this time in gaol that he wrote his allegorical novel: \"Pilgrim's Progress\". We do not know whether he wrote it all while he was in gaol. The book is in two parts. The first part finishes with the words: \u201cSo I awoke, and behold it was a dream\u201d. When the second part begins he says \u201c..as I slept I dreamt again\u201d. This might mean that he wrote the second part in 1677 when he was in gaol again. This is only a guess, we do not know.\nHis release.\nBunyan was released in January 1672, when Charles II issued the \u201cDeclaration of Religious Indulgence\u201d which meant that people were free to worship God in the way they wanted. The king had done this mainly because he wanted the Catholics to have less power. Non-conformist sects could register and get a license. Bunyan became pastor (priest) of the Bedford church. In March 1675, he was again imprisoned for preaching (because Charles II withdrew the Declaration of Religious Indulgence). This time he seems to have been in the Bedford town gaol on the stone bridge over the river Ouse. After a few months, he was let out. He was a very popular preacher, so he was not arrested again. His book \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" was published in 1678. He also wrote several other books about religion, but \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" was the one that became extremely popular. Because Bunyan did not have a formal education he wrote in a very direct style which ordinary people could understand. A passage from Part Two of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" beginning \"Who would true Valour see\" is sung regularly as a hymn.\nOn his way to London, in 1688, he caught a severe cold from rats and bats, and died a painful death. His grave is in the cemetery at Bunhill Fields in London."}

Originally, smiths made things from metal by using a hammer.\nAs an English suffix, \"-smith\" at the end of a word means a craftsmen. For example, a \"locksmith\" makes locks.\nTypes of smiths.\nTypes of smiths include: \nArtisans and craftpersons.\nThe ancient traditional tool of the smith is a forge or \"smithy\", which is a fire which allows compressed air (through a bellows) to heat the inside of the forge until it is hot enough for metal to become more malleable so that it can be hammered into the shape that is required. Smith or smithy refers to the hammering onto the metal using an anvil to support the work. Anvils come in many sizes and shapes. \nThe term, \"metalsmith\", often refers to artisans and craftpersons who practice their craft in many different metals, including gold, copper and silver. Jewelers often refer to their craft as \"metalsmithing\", and many universities offer degree programs in metalsmithing, jewelry and blacksmithing as part of their fine arts programs.\nA \"tinker\" is a metalsmith who mends kettles, pots and pans. They were often poor, itinerant workers (walking from place to place looking for jobs).\nMachinists.\nMachinists are metalsmiths who produce high-precision parts and tools. The most advanced of these tools, CNC machines, are computer controlled and largely automated."}

It is a story or picture with a hidden meaning. The characters in allegories are symbols which represent particular ideas. The story has a figurative meaning, not just a literal one.\nAllegory is an example of rhetoric, but an allegory does not have to be a story in language. It may be something to look at, such as a painting or sculpture.\nAn allegory is like a long metaphor. People have to use their imagination to understand what it is trying to say. A fable or parable is a short allegory with one basic idea (a moral).\nSometimes people say that stories have meanings which the author, in fact, did not intend. For instance, many people have suggested that \"The Lord of the Rings\" was an allegory for the World Wars, but, in fact, it was written well before the outbreak of World War II, and J.R.R. Tolkien said that it was not an allegory. In this way people sometimes change the author\u2019s ideas. Sometimes they do it for their own political reasons.\nExamples.\nAllegory has been a favourite form in the literature of nearly every nation. It is often used as a way of criticizing things or people where it would not be possible to do so directly.\nIn classical literature Plato and Ovid wrote allegories. Dante Alighieri wrote allegories in \"The Divine Comedy\". In the Middle Ages \"Everyman\" was a morality play. John Bunyan\u2019s \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" tells the story of a man trying to lead a Christian life. Jonathan Swift wrote \"Gulliver's Travels\", which tells about the strange customs of (made-up) faraway countries, but he was really criticizing things about his own country, the United Kingdom. \"Animal Farm\" by George Orwell is another example of an allegory, this time of the Soviet Union during Josef Stalin's era and the Russian Revolution. Some of the characters can be directly linked to figures during that time.\nSongs may also include allegories. \"Waist Deep In The Big Muddy\" tells a story of American soldiers in the 1800s, ordered by their commander to march into the Mississippi River, which they could never cross on foot. In truth, it told the story of soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and being expected to do the white guy's bidding.\nAllegories still continue to be popular today. Pictures, movies and plays can be allegories. William Golding\u2019s novel \"Lord of the Flies\" also has allegorical meaning. \"Star Trek\" used a great deal of allegory, to look at social conditions and moral values in the present, while telling stories based in the future. Alien races were often a reflection of Earth's own races and countries.\nAllegorical artworks include Sandro Botticelli's \"La Primavera (Allegory of Spring)\" and Jan Vermeer's \"The Allegory of Painting\"."}

It is in the borough of Milton Keynes.\nHistory.\nThe town was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Neuport\", which is an Old English word meaning \"New Market Town\". At that time it was fairly new, having been founded by Norman invaders. The suffix \"Pagnell\" came later, when the manor passed into the hands of the Pagnell (Paynel) family.\nAt one time Newport Pagnell was one of the largest towns in the County of Buckinghamshire but today the new town of Milton Keynes has made it much less important. \nTickford Bridge, over the River Ouze, was built in 1810. It is the only iron bridge in Britain that still carries main road traffic. This is the oldest iron bridge in the world that is still in constant use. There is a plaque near the footbridge on the side that gives details of its history and construction. A large set of sluice gates used to control downstream flooding of the River Great Ouse is near the bridge.\nSince 1954, Tickford Street in Newport Pagnell has been the home of the Aston Martin site, where all Aston Martin cars were built, until the recent opening of the new Ford Motor Company luxury division plant for Aston Martin built at Gaydon, Warwickshire.\nThe modern civil parish of Newport Pagnell stops at the M1, but the ecclesiastical parish extends to include Broughton and Caldecote. The parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul."}

These embyros are protected by several membranes, and have a much larger food supply than amphibian eggs.\nThe 'invention' of the cleidoic egg, and its embryonic membranes, is the main reason why the eggs of an amniote do not need to be laid in water.\nThus, as distinct from the amphibians, \"amniotes are truly terrestrial\". Secondarily, many reptiles and mammals returned to water, and mammals bear the young live, as do some reptile groups. This evolutionary flexibility is much less common in amphibians.\nEvolutionary history.\nThe first amniotes, such as \"Casineria\", looked like small lizards. They evolved about 340 million years ago, in the Mississippian or Lower Carboniferous. Their eggs could survive out of the water. This let amniotes move into environments that had less water. The amniotes moved across the Earth. Most vertebrates that live on land are amniotes, as are most of the air-breathing animals of the sea.\nVery early in the evolutionary history of amniotes, they split into two main lines, the synapsids and the sauropsids, both of which persist into the modern era.\nThe oldest known fossil synapsid is \"Protoclepsydrops\" from about 320 million years ago, while the oldest known sauropsid is probably \"Paleothyris\", in the order Captorhinida, from the Middle Pennsylvanian epoch (about 306\u2013312 million years ago).\nEggs.\nOne can assume the ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places, as such modest-sized animals would not have difficulty finding depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the ancient forests, and dry conditions were probably not the main reason why the soft shell emerged.\nIn fish and amphibians there is only one inner membrane, also called an embryonic membrane. In amniotes the inner anatomy of the egg has evolved further and new structures have developed to take care of the gas exchanges between the embryo and the atmosphere, as well as dealing with the waste problems. To grow a thicker and tougher shell required new ways to supply the embryo with oxygen, as diffusion alone was not enough.\nAfter the egg developed these structures, further sophistication allowed amniotes to lay much bigger eggs in much drier habitats. Bigger eggs allowed for bigger offspring, and bigger adults could produce bigger eggs, so amniotes grew bigger than their ancestors. Real growth was not possible, however, until they stopped relying on small invertebrates as their main food source and started to eat plants or other vertebrates, or returned to the water. New habits and heavier bodies meant further evolution for the amniotes, both in behavior and anatomy.\nThree groups.\nThere are three main lines of amniotes, which may be distinguished by the structure of the skull and in particular the number of temporal fenestrae (openings) behind the eye. In anapsids (turtles) there are none, in synapsids (mammals and their extinct relatives) there is one, and in most diapsids (non-anapsid reptiles, including dinosaurs and birds) there are two.\nThe skeletal remains of amniotes have at least two pairs of sacral ribs, a sternum in the pectoral girdle (shoulders area) and an astragalus bone in the ankle.\nClassification.\nA simplified phylogeny of tetrapods goes like this:\nThis is perhaps better than the older taxonomy, which lists recent branches like birds and mammals as classes on mere traditional grounds."}

This class includes mammals and earlier groups related to mammals. Synapsids are one of the two major groups of amniotes. The sister group, which gave rise to the reptiles, is the Sauropsida. Both groups evolved from early amniotes about 345 million years ago during the early or mid Carboniferous period.\nSynapsids include the Pelycosauria (Pennsylvanian to Permian), and the Therapsida (Lower Permian to present).\nThe pelycosaurs were dominant on land in the Permian, and went under at the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event. The therapsids were dominant on land in the Lower Triassic, but by the Upper Triassic the dinosaurs had taken over.\nPrimitive and advanced synapsids.\nThe mammal-like reptiles are traditionally divided into a primitive group and an advanced group, known respectively as pelycosaurs and therapsids. Pelycosaurs are a paraphyletic group of six primitive families of synapsids.120 They were all rather lizard-like with sprawling gait and possibly horny scutes. The therapsids contain the more advanced synapsids, having a more erect pose and possibly hair, at least in some forms. The latter are the ancestors of mammals. Thus both of the two synapsid groups represent evolutionary grades: the pelycosaurs have given rise to the therapsids, who in their turn have given rise to the mammals.\nMammals and reptiles.\nThe therapsids ('beast face') used to be called mammal-like reptiles. This was a mistake, because they were never reptiles. The split between Synapsids and Sauropsids (the group which gave rise to reptiles) took place long before therapsids evolved.\nThere are a number of characteristics which cannot be seen on fossils, but which are of great importance. Mammals are distinguished from reptiles by fundamental differences in the development of the blood system. These differences are such that it would be almost impossible for mammals to be derived from reptiles.\nThis supports the division of amniotes into sauropsida and synapsida.\nSynapsid skull.\nTemporal openings.\nSynapsids evolved a fenestra (hole) behind each eye orbit on the lower part of the skull. It allows better attachment sites for jaw muscles than the original anapsid condition.\nA parallel development took place in the diapsida, who evolved two rather than one opening behind each eye.\nOriginally, the opening in the skull left the inner cranium only covered by the jaw muscles, but in higher therapsids and mammals the sphenoid bone has expanded to close the opening.\nTeeth.\nSynapsids had differentiated teeth. These include the canines, molars, and incisors.\nThe trend towards differentiation is found in some labyrinthodonts and early anapsid reptilians. They have enlarged first teeth on the maxilla, forming a form of proto-canines. This trait was subsequently lost in the sauropsid line, but developed further in the synapsids. Early synapsids could have 2 or even 3 enlarged 'canines', but in the therapsids, the pattern had settled to one canine in each upper jaw half. The lower canines developed later.\nTaxonomy.\nNote: in evolutionary terms, the mammals are entirely within the Synapsida. Their status as a separate class is traditional Linnaean taxonomy: as a clade they are a sub-group of the Therapsida."}
