The chemical composition of diorite is intermediate, between that of mafic gabbro and felsic granite. Diorite is usually grey to dark-grey in color, but it can also be black or bluish-grey, and frequently has a greenish cast. It is distinguished from gabbro based on the composition of the plagioclase species; the plagioclase in diorite is richer in sodium and poorer in calcium. Diorite may contain small amounts of quartz, microcline, and olivine. Zircon, apatite, titanite, magnetite, ilmenite, and sulfides occur as accessory minerals. Minor amounts of muscovite may also be present. Varieties deficient in hornblende and other dark minerals are called \"leucodiorite\". When olivine and more iron-rich augite are present, the rock grades into \"ferrodiorite\", which is transitional to gabbro. The presence of significant quartz makes the rock type \"quartz-diorite\" (&gt;5% quartz) or tonalite (&gt;20% quartz), and if orthoclase (potassium feldspar) is present at greater than 10 percent, the rock type grades into \"monzodiorite\" or granodiorite. A dioritic rock containing feldspathoid mineral/s and no quartz is termed \"foid-bearing diorite\" or \"foid diorite\" according to content.\nDiorite has a phaneritic, often speckled, texture of coarse grain size and is occasionally porphyritic.\n\"Orbicular diorite\" shows alternating concentric growth bands of plagioclase and amphibole surrounding a nucleus, within a diorite porphyry matrix.\nDiorites may be associated with either granite or gabbro intrusions, into which they may subtly merge. Diorite results from the partial melting of a mafic rock above a subduction zone. It is commonly produced in volcanic arcs, and in cordilleran mountain building, such as in the Andes Mountains, as large batholiths. The extrusive volcanic equivalent rock type is andesite.\nOccurrence.\nDiorite is a relatively rare rock; source localities include Leicestershire (one name for microdiorite\u2014markfieldite\u2014exists due to the rock's being found in the village of Markfield) and Aberdeenshire, UK; Guernsey; Sondrio, Italy; Thuringia and Saxony in Germany; Finland; Romania; Northeastern Turkey; central Sweden; the Darrans range of New Zealand; the Andes Mountains.\nAn orbicular variety found in Corsica is called corsite."}

It was released on March 31, 2016. It has almost everything the iPhone 6S has but in the body of an iPhone 5S. It does not have 3D Touch or a barometer. However, just like the iPhone 6S, it has an improved Apple A9 system-on-a-chip, an improved battery, and an improved camera that can record 4K video.\nAlong with the iPhone 6S and the iPhone X, the iPhone SE was discontinued by Apple on September 12, 2018. The iPhone SE currently does not have an upcoming model based on the original iPhone SE. \"Business Insider\" wrote that \"Apple made a big mistake by removing its smallest and most affordable iPhone from its lineup\", suggesting that the company was ignoring customers who are worried about the loss of a smartphone type that is both affordable and small enough to be comfortable to use. \"Quartz\" reported that women and other smartphone users with small hands get sore hands from holding large smartphones. The technology website \"Gizmodo\" was also concerned that Apple discontinued the iPhone SE, hoping that \"there will be a return to smaller phones\", as well as hoping that people will be able to hold a phone \"in a single hand, and be able to use it fully.\" \nHistory.\nEarlier iPhones, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, had much larger screens. However, there are a significant number of customers who would prefer to use a smaller 4-inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S. \nApple stated in the \"Let us loop you in\" event on March 21, 2016 that they sold over 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015. In this event, they proved that many customers wanted smaller phones. Later in the event they presented the iPhone SE, describing it as \"the most powerful 4-inch phone ever.\" \nThe iPhone SE, iPhone 6S, and iPhone 6S Plus were the last iPhones to feature the standard 3.5 mm headphone jack.\nAlong with the iPhone 6S and the iPhone X, the iPhone SE was discontinued by Apple on September 12, 2018.\nSpecifications.\nDesign.\nThe iPhone SE looks almost identical to the iPhone 5 and 5S, except the iPhone SE has got rounded edges and a stainless steel Apple logo on the back. Cases designed to fit the 5 and the 5S will also fit an . The iPhone SE is available in the colors Space Gray, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. \nReviews.\n\"CNET\" was positive about the iPhone SE, considering the iPhone SE to be a \"great choice at the small end, with no compromises\". \"CNET\" also praised Apple for adapting the iPhone 6S generation phones into different sizes to increase variety of phone types; the smaller 4.0-inch SE, 4.7-inch 6S, and 5.5-inch 6S Plus. In a later article, \"CNET\" summarized the iPhone SE to be \u201cthe smaller, more pocketable member of the iPhone family. It was Apple's compact, budget option, and its 4-inch screen and tinier overall size were total throwback stuff. Consumers loved the battery life and that it still had a headphone jack.\u201d\n\"The Verge\" considered the iPhone SE to be \"a much-improved, well-designed, small phone with great battery life\" and a \"great upgrade\" for customers who currently own 4S or 5S models, noting the device's familiar appearance, high performance (even noting that the small screen is the only problem for multitasking and certain apps), and improved battery life. Giving the iPhone SE an 8.7 out of 10, Goode praised many features of the iPhone SE: \"the iPhone SE is not a tiny little engine of innovation. It's today's tech in yesterday's phone body. As with anything, we should be wary of giving too much praise to something that's just doing its job.\"\n\"TechCrunch\" praised the iPhone SE's design. They mentioned that the phone appealed \"not just to the nostalgic and neophobic (fear of new things), but simply people who prefer a smaller phone.\" The employees who work at TechCrunch do not have \"particularly large or small hands, but [they] preferred this highly pocketable, proven design to the new one for a number of reasons\", further praising the iPhone SE as the best iPhone that Apple has ever made."}

It was devastated by Hannibal, in the year 214 BC.\nToday, it is mostly known for its beaches. The best-known sight is the Piscina Mirabilis, a water reservoir, of about 70m by 30m which the Romans constructed to support the fleet.\nThe current landscape around Misenum is characterized by hills and crater lakes. It is the result of the volcanic activity of the Phlegraean Fields."}

It is in the civil parish of Calstock.\nGeography.\nAlbaston is about 1\u00a0mile (2\u00a0kilometres) from the centre of Gunnislake and half-a-mile (0.7\u00a0kilometres) from Gunnislake railway station, the junction of the Tamar Valley Line from Plymouth.\nHistory.\nIn the past, Albaston was closely connected with the nearby mine at Drakewalls. The success of the Drakewalls mine in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century led to the growth of the village of Albaston, including the building of a Methodist chapel and several shops, homes and businesses. A brewery, Edward Bowhay &amp; Brothers, was established by 1877; this brewery had closed by 1930.\nFacilities.\nThe village has a Methodist church, known as Tamar Valley Methodist Church. It was opened in 2001.\nThe Old Post Office House is now rented as a holiday home accommodating nine people.\nNotable residents.\nChristian Pentecostal leader Thomas Ball Barratt was born in Albaston in 1862, the son of a mining engineer. He moved to Norway when his father began working for a mine there and in later life became the founder of the Norwegian Pentecostal movement."}

The claim must be personally given to the new, third party defendant, by the third party plaintiff (the defendant bringing the claim for contribution relief). In contrast, a counter-claim asserts that the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to offset the damages awarded to plaintiff by the proportionate share of any responsibility, liability, or fault assigned to the plaintiff by the jury. Finally, a cross-claim is the same as a counter-claim or contribution claim, except that it is asserted by a defendant against other defendants. Counter-claims and cross claims do not require personal service because no new parties are being added to the claim.\nIn some state court systems, a contribution claim must be made as a new case, and the person making it must pay a fee. In other states, no extra fee is required."}

It lies on the eastern shore of Lake Como. It is about north of Milan and about north-west of Lecco. It has an area of 11.3\u00a0km\u00b2 and has twelve \"frazioni\": Bancola, Casate, Castello, Cisarino, Genico, Giussana, Grumo, La Foppa, Mugiasco, Olcianico, Sornico and Villa. At the end of 2014 the population was 2176 people, in 983 families. Lierna is the most represented village on Lake Como over the centuries in works of art.\nLierna borders the comunes of Esino Lario, Mandello del Lario, Oliveto Lario and Varenna.\nHistory.\nThe first mention of Lierna dates to 854 AD, but Roman remains, including a mosaic floor now in the Palazzo Belgioioso of Lecco, attest to much earlier settlement. The name of the village may be of Roman or of Celtic origin. Between 1035 and 1202 it was a feud of the Monastery of San Dionigi in Milan. Lierna was contested between Milan and Como, and between the Della Torre and Visconti families. It passed into the hands of the Marchesino Stanga in 1499, and in 1533 to the Sfondrati family of Cremona, who held it until 1788. Lierna became a \"comune\" in 1743, when it was separated from that of Mandello.\nIn 1927 the Milanese sculptor Giannino Castiglioni opened a studio at his house in Lierna. He died in Lierna on 27 August 1971. He left some preparatory plaster casts to the comune; a museum to house them is under construction.\nIn 1933 an incomplete fossil of \"Lariosaurus balsami\", a nothosaurid from the Middle Triassic (circa 240 million years ago) of which the first example was discovered at Perledo, some 10\u00a0km north of Lierna, was found in a quarry in the \"frazione\" of Grumo. It is now in the Museo di Storia Naturale in the Palazzo Belgioioso of Lecco."}

{"id": "602627", "revid": "551548", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=602627", "title": "Asiago", "text": "Asiago is a mountain town in the Northern Italian alps and the birthplace of the world-famous Asiago cheese. The town is located on a plateau at an altitude of 3800\u00a0feet (1000\u00a0meters) and has a population of more than 6000 people. Asiago is also known as the site of a major battle during the first World War and is home to a war memorial and observatory. Its current economy is based on farming, dairy production and tourism. Roads connect Asiago to the cities of Verona, Venice and Trento and their international airports.\nGeography.\nThe town of Asiago is located at an altitude of 3280\u00a0feet (1,000\u00a0meters), and it covers an area of 1.8 square miles (2.95\u00a0Km2). Asiago is the largest city on its plateau. The land is flat with low hills, and it\u2019s surrounded by the Brenta and the Astico rivers. The land is covered by forests or it is used as pasture.\nThe temperature varies from 25\u00a0\u00b0F to 71\u00a0\u00b0F (-4C to 21C). The warmer season is between June and September with an average daily high temperature around 64\u00a0\u00b0F(18C). The cold season is from November to March, with an average daily high temperature below 43\u00a0\u00b0F(6C). Most of the snow falls between November and April with an average snow depth between 0.1 and 0.4\u00a0inches.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nHumans were present in the area since Paleolithic times. Inside of local caves, evidence of the presence of first settlers, such as weapons, stone tools and cave painting, have been documented.\nIn the following centuries, the plateau became the settlement for different peoples like Bavarians, Scandinavians and Cimbri. These different cultures have left their signs in the local language and traditions.\nAsiago and the six other towns on the plateau formed an alliance and shared a common government between 1310 and 1807. The alliance was an autonomous state and an ally of the Republic of Venice. After 1807, Asiago became part of the Republic of Venice and then of the Italian kingdom.\nWorld War I.\nDuring World War I (1915-1918), the plateau was the place of many battles between the Austro-Hungarians and Italians.\nThe deadliest battle took place on the 15th of May 1916 and lasted for two weeks. For the first time on the Italian front, the Austro-Hungarian army used toxic gas. The battle caused the deaths of 15,000 Italian and 10,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers. The civilian population of Asiago was evacuated and the town was destroyed as the result of heavy bombing. After the end of the war, some of the original population returned to Asiago and rebuilt the town.\nThe famous American writer Ernest Hemingway spent time in Asiago during the first World War as an ambulance driver. In 1922, he wrote a poem inspired by this experience and called \u201cArsiero, Asiago\u201d.\nEconomy.\nThe traditional economy was based on farming and on the use of other natural resources taken from the forest. More recently this has been replaced by the year-round tourism industry and by small manufacturing and food processing factories.\nAsiago offers many outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing. There are 500\u00a0km of ski slopes and 260\u00a0km of biking trails (the Plateau Grand Tour). Many tourists are also attracted by the opportunity to taste local foods and visit historical sites from the first World War. Since 2003, the number of tourists has been decreasing every year. In 2015, 174,139 tourists visited Asiago.\nAsiago cheese.\nAsiago is the birthplace and the place of production of Asiago cheese. Production dates back to the 11th century. During the first World War the method of production was changed in order to feed the growing number of soldiers present on the plateau. This led to the development of the modern version of Asiago cheese, which is now popular around the world. The town of Asiago is the fifth major site of cheese production in Italy, exporting primarily to Switzerland and the United States. The production and origin of Asiago cheese are established under European union rules and guaranteed by a P.D.O. (protected designation of origin) label.\nPopulation.\nIn 2016, the population of Asiago was 6,426. Following a common trend in Italian mountain communities, the population has decreased in number and has become older in age in the last few decades.\nTransportation.\nAsiago is connected by road to the cities of Vicenza, Trento and Bassano. Regular bus services connect Asiago to near towns and cities. The closest international airports are the ones of Verona and Venice. Asiago is also the site of a small airfield, which is a popular destination for flying in from Northern Italy, Southern Germany and Southern Austria.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe observatory of Asiago is home to the largest optical telescope in Italy, and it is operated by the University of Padua. It was built in 1942, and it\u2019s located at an altitude of 3428\u00a0feet (1.045\u00a0meters).\nThe Asiago War Memorial is a monument containing the bones of about 60,000 Italian and Austrian-Hungarian soldiers who died on the plateau during World War I. It was built in 1936 and opened by Mussolini in 1937. It is still an important national crypt and the place of official national celebrations.\nThe town hall was rebuilt in 1929 after it was destroyed during the first World War. It is made of white and red marble and decorated with Murano glass and mosaic. Its tower houses a 1600\u00a0kg bell that is 139\u00a0cm in diameter.\nForte Interrotto is a fort overlooking the town. It was built in 1887 at an altitude of 4566\u00a0feet and was originally used as military barracks. During the first World War, it became a fortress and was occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces on the 22th of May 1916. Its ruins are now a popular hiking destination."}

In 1972, Din Tai Fung started selling xiaolongbao and soon began to expand. The restaurant is recommended by the New York Times and the Michelin Guide. Din Tai Fung\u2019s branches have spread around the world along with its business philosophy.\nHistory.\nDin Tai Fung was originally a retail cooking oil business founded by Yang Bing-yi in 1958. Din Tai Fun got its name from Heng Tai Fung, the cooking oil company where founder Yang previously worked, and Din Mei oil, the oil supplier of Yang\u2019s business. In 1972, as a result of the unsuccessful cooking oil business, half of the Din Tai Fung oil shop was turned into a restaurant where Yang and his wife started selling steamed dumplings, xiaolongbao. Gradually, Din Tai Fung\u2019s xiaolongbao business made a bigger profit than its cooking oil business, so the founders decided to close the oil business and focus on the restaurant business. Din Tai Fung was then expanded to a 300-seat restaurant. The restaurant is originally located on Xinyi Road in Taipei City and could sell 4,000 pieces of xiaolongbao a day.\nIn 2000 Din Tai Fung was turned into an incorporated company by its CEO, Yang Ji-hua, son of Yang Bing-yi. Din Tai Fung\u2019s management team was formed and a central kitchen was established. Later, Din Tai Fung\u2019s franchise rights were offered to some overseas companies such as The Breadtalk Group and The Moment Group. Now Din Tai Fung is a chain restaurant company that operates branches around the world.\nBusiness Philosophy.\nSince the opening of its first restaurant in Taiwan, Din Tai Fung\u2019s aim has been to keep control of its food and service quality and make sure customers around the world have the same food experience every time they visit. Din Tai Fung requires all of its franchises to follow its business model. The company rejected several franchising requests because of concerns about not meeting its standards in its branches. The restaurant not only standardizes its recipes, but also focuses on training its staff in order to offer the same service in every branch. Customers are able to watch the chefs make xiaolongbao in the kitchen through a glass window, and Din Tai Fung does not advertise.\nCuisine.\nDin Tai Fung serves cuisine that originated in the region of Shanghai, and its most famous dish is a type of steamed dumpling called xiaolongbao. Din Tai Fung has very precise standards for making xiaolongbao. The dough and fillings of the xiaolongbao have to be weighed carefully. They must weigh exactly 21g, with 5g of dough and 16g of filling. Din Tai Fung\u2019s xiaolongbao must have eighteen folds. After doing a lot of testing, the chefs found that the eighteen folds give xiaolongbao the best texture and also the best appearance.\nDin Tai Fung also serves other Shanghai cuisine such as dumplings, buns, fried rice, wontons and noodles.\nBranches.\nDin Tai Fung\u2019s original restaurant in Taiwan was founded in 1972. Since then, Din Tai Fung has established 119 branches in 14 countries. These countries include Taiwan, Japan, the United States, mainland China, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Macau, UAE, and the Philippines.\nReputation.\nIn 1993, Din Tai Fung was listed as one of the top ten restaurants in the world by the New York Times, which made it well-known on the international stage. After opening its first branch in Japan in 1996, Din Tai Fung gained more international recognition. In 2010, Din Taig Fung\u2019s Silvercord branch in Hong Kong received the restaurant\u2019s first Michelin Star, and it was awarded a Michelin Star for the next three years. In 2013, CNN rated Din Tai Fung as the second best franchise in the world for travelers because of its xiaolongbao."}

He began his film career by playing antagonistic and supporting roles before graduating to a lead actor. After starring in numerous commercially successful films throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he has continued to hold a matin\u00e9e idol status in the popular culture of Tamil Nadu. Writing for \"Slate\", Grady Hendrix called him the \"biggest movie star you've probably never heard of.\" Rajinikanth has also worked in other Indian film industries such as Bollywood, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali.\nHe made his cinematic debut with K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama \"Apoorva Raagangal\", in which he played a minor role of an abusive husband. He had his first major role in Balachander's Telugu drama film \"Anthuleni Katha\" (1976), and got his breakthrough in Tamil with \"Moondru Mudichu\" (1976)\u2014also directed by Balachander. His style and mannerisms in the latter earned recognition from the audience. In 1977, he acted in 15 films, playing negative characters in most of them, including \"Avargal\", \"16 Vayathinile\", \"Aadu Puli Attam\" and \"Gaayathri\". He had positive roles in \"Kavikkuyil\", the Kannada film \"Sahodarara Savaal\", and the Telugu film \"Chilakamma Cheppindi\", in which he played the protagonist for the first time in his career. His role as a failed lover in S. P. Muthuraman's \"Bhuvana Oru Kelvikkuri\" (1977) won him critical acclaim. In 1978, he was cast as the main lead in the Tamil film \"Bairavi\". The same year, he received critical acclaim for his roles in \"Mullum Malarum\" and \"Aval Appadithan\"; the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actor. He made his Malayalam cinema debut with I. V. Sasi's fantasy drama \"Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum\" (1979), an adaptation of a story from \"One Thousand and One Nights\". By the end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian languages and established a career in Tamil cinema.\nHe played dual roles in the action thriller \"Billa\" (1980), which was a remake of the Bollywood film \"Don\" (1978). It was his biggest commercial success to that point and gave him the \"action-hero\" image. Balachander's \"Thillu Mullu\" (1981), the Tamil remake of the Bollywood film \"Gol Maal\" (1979), was Rajinikanth's first full-length comedy film. He played triple roles in the 1982 Tamil film \"Moondru Mugam\", which earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards ceremony. The following year, he made his Bollywood debut with Rama Rao Tatineni's \"Andha Kanoon\"; it was among the top-grossing Bollywood films in 1983. Muthuraman's \"Nallavanuku Nallavan\" (1984) won him that year's Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor. In 1985, he portrayed the Hindu saint Raghavendra Swami in his 100th film \"Sri Raghavendrar\", a box-office failure. In the latter half of the 1980s, he starred in several films in Tamil and Hindi, including \"Padikkadavan\" (1985), \"Mr. Bharath\" (1986), \"Bhagwaan Dada\" (1986), \"Velaikaran\" (1987), \"Guru Sishyan\" (1988) and \"Dharmathin Thalaivan\" (1988). During this time, he made his debut in American cinema with a supporting role in the mystery adventure film \"Bloodstone\" (1988), a box-office failure.\nRajinikanth continued to act in Bollywood, often playing supporting roles in films such as \"Hum\", \"Khoon Ka Karz\", and \"Phool Bane Angaray\" (all in 1991). Mani Ratnam's Tamil film \"Thalapathi\" (1991), based on the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\", earned him critical acclaim. Suresh Krissna's \"Annamalai\" (1992), P. Vasu's \"Mannan\" (1992) and \"Uzhaippali\" (1993) are among his box-office successes in Tamil. He made his debut as a screenwriter with \"Valli\" (1993), a commercial failure. The Suresh Krissna-directed \"Baashha\", in which he played a crime boss, was a major commercial success in his career and earned him a \"demigod\" status in Tamil Nadu. Later that year he acted in K. S. Ravikumar's \"Muthu\", which was dubbed into Japanese. In Japan, the film grossed a record US$1.6\u00a0million in 1998 and was largely instrumental in creating a fan-base for Rajinikanth in the country. \"Padayappa\" (1999), his second collaboration with Ravikumar, went on to become the highest-grossing Tamil film to that point. In 2002 Rajinikanth produced, wrote and starred in the fantasy thriller \"Baba\", which fell short of market expectations and incurred heavy losses for its distributors. After a three-year sabbatical, he returned to acting with the comedy horror film \"Chandramukhi\" (2005); it went on to become the highest-grossing Tamil film to that point, and its theatrical run lasted 126 weeks at a theatre in Chennai. Rajinikanth was paid 260\u00a0million for his role in S. Shankar's \"Sivaji\" (2007), which made him the second-highest paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan. He played dual roles, as a scientist and an andro-humanoid robot, in the science fiction film \"Enthiran\" (2010). It was India's most expensive production at the time of its release, and is among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. He played triple roles in the 2014 animated film \"Kochadaiiyaan\", the first in India to be shot with motion capture technology; it was a commercial failure. Two years later, Rajinikanth played a Malaysian Tamil crime boss in Pa. Ranjith's \"Kabali\", which had the biggest weekend opening for an Indian film."}

Vijay went on to play lead roles in his father's directorial ventures such as \"Rasigan\" (1994) and \"Deva\" (1995).

The following year, he performed in three films: \"Friends\", \"Badri\" and \"Shahjahan\". All of which had a 100-day theatrical run. His subsequent films \"Vaseegara\" and \"Pudhiya Geethai\" did not do well at the box office. The success of his masala film \"Thirumalai\" (2003), where he was paired opposite Jyothika, changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero. He appeared next as a kabaddi player opposite Trisha in Dharani's \"Ghilli\" (2004), which went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year. It was also the first Tamil film to earn 500\u00a0million (Indian rupees). His performance as a caring brother in the masala film \"Thirupachi\" (2005) earned him a second Tamil Nadu State Award.

His performances in both films received positive critical feedback, He followed that with A. L. Vijay's \"Thalaivaa\" (2013) and the multi-starrer \"Jilla\" (2014). The latter featured him along with Mohanlal. Both films were successful. He teamed up with Murugadoss again for the action film \"Kaththi\" (2014). The film, which had Vijay playing dual roles as a thief and an idealist, became one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of that year. He featured as a tribal warrior in his next film, \"Puli\" (2015); it was a commercial failure. The following year, he played a police officer in \"Theri\" (2016).

He debuted as a child actor in the 1960 Tamil film \"Kalathur Kannamma\", which won him the President's Gold Medal. Since then he has acted in over 200 films in several languages including: Malayalam, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada and Bengali. After a few projects as a child artist he took a break to continue his education. He later concentrated on dance choreography and worked as an assistant choreographer. During this time, he made uncredited appearances in a few films which he worked on.\nIn 1973, Kamal landed his first adult role as Thiagu in the film by K. Balachander, whom the actor considers his mentor. He continued to act in minor roles in several films such as \"Sollathaan Ninaikkiren\" (1973) and \"Naan Avanillai\" (1974), most of which were directed by Balachander. His breakthrough as an independent lead actor came with the 1974 Malayalam film \"Kanyakumari\". His work in it won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Malayalam). Following that, he starred in a series of films in both languagesTamil and Malayalam. His breakthrough in Tamil cinema came with Balachander's \"Apoorva Raagangal\" (1975); the film earned him a second Filmfare Award, his first in Tamil. Between 1974 and 1978, he won six Filmfare Awards including four consecutive wins for the Best Tamil Actor. Kamal turned producer for \"Raja Paarvai\" (1981), in which he played the lead role of a blind musician. The film was produced under the \"Hasan Brothers\" banner which was later renamed Raaj Kamal Films International.\nKamal debuted in Bollywood with Balachander's \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\" (1981), which was a remake of his 1978 Telugu film \"Maro Charitra\". His role as a school teacher who looks after an amnesic girl in \"Moondram Pirai\" (1982) won him several accolades, including the Best Actor honours at the National Film Awards and Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. His work in Ramesh Sippy's Hindi film \"Saagar\" (1985), a triangular love story, was nominated in both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories at the 33rd Filmfare Awards. Under Raaj Kamal Films International, he produced films such as: \"Vikram\" (1986), \"Apoorva Sagodharargal\" (1989), \"Thevar Magan\" (1992) and \"Hey Ram\" (2000). As a producer he won a Filmfare Award and National Film Award for \"Apoorva Sagodharargal\" and \"Thevar Magan\". Seven films featuring Kamal have been submitted by India to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the most for any actor in India. In 2009, he became one of the few actors in India to have completed 50 years working in cinema. His work \"Vishwaroopam\" (2013), which he also produced and directed, won two awards at the 60th National Film Awards.\nAs actor.\n! scope=\"col\" |Film\n! scope=\"col\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\"|Role\n!

{"id": "602811", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=602811", "title": "Sino-Korean vocabulary", "text": "Sino-Korean vocabulary, or hanja-eo (hangul: \ud55c\uc790\uc5b4, hanja: \u6f22\u5b50\u8a9e) are Chinese loanwords in the Korean language. Like Japanese, Korean is unrelated to the Chinese language. Chinese is a Sino-Tibetan language while Korean is a language isolate (meaning that no known languages are related to it), but Chinese has influenced Korean so much that it made many changes to the Korean language. Chinese loanwords make up around 60% of the language's vocabulary, even though Koreans tend to use native Korean words a lot more in everyday speech. This is similar to how around 50% of English words come from Latin, French, or Greek, but English speakers tend to use native English words a lot more. Also similar to Japanese, Chinese serves as one the three main sources for Korean words, the other two being native Korean words and words from other foreign languages, especially English. When some Chinese loanwords changed meanings in Japanese, their meanings also changed in Korean because Korea was a Japanese colony at the time these words changed. Since Koreans were forced by law to speak Japanese and forbidden to speak Korean, the Chinese loanwords adopted the new Japanese meanings when Koreans were allowed to freely speak their own language again.\nSince the Korean Peninsula split into two different countries, North Korea and South Korea, the different dialects developed very differently from each other.\nSouth Korea.\nToday, South Koreans write using a mix of hangul (the native Korean alphabet) and hanja \u6f22\u5b50 (the Korean version of Chinese characters), although they write using the latter far less than Chinese and Japanese do. Since Chinese words often sound similar to each other even in Chinese, they also became homophones when they came into Korean, but since Korean lacks tones, they sound even more alike in Korean. South Koreans usually write only in hangul, but sometimes when a word has many homophones and the meaning of the word is unclear from context, Koreans sometimes write the word in hanja so that there is no confusion between words. For example, since the Korean word \"sudo\" (hanja: \uc218\ub3c4) has many homophones and can have meanings like \"spiritual discipline\", \"prisoner\", \"city of water, i.e. Venice or Suzhou\", \"paddy rice\", \"drain/rivers/path of surface water\", \"tunnel\", or \"capital city\", so to avoid confusion about what \"sudo\" means, these words can be written by their hanja, which are \u4fee\u9053, \u56da\u5f92, \u6c34\u90fd, \u6c34\u7a3b, \u6c34\u9053, \u96a7\u9053, and \u9996\u90fd. However, Koreans almost never write native Korean words in hanja. For example, native Korean words like \"Hananim\" (hangul: \ud558\ub098\ub2d8, hanja: \u795e, meaning: God), \"mul\" (hangul: \ubb3c, hanja: \u6c34, meaning: water), \"mal\" (hangul: \ub9d0, hanja: \u99ac, meaning: horse), \"nara\" (hangul: \ub098\ub77c, hanja: \u570b, country), and \"saram\" (hangul: \uc0ac\ub78c, hanja: \u4eba, meaning: person) will almost always be written in hangul, even though many of them can be written in hanja. This is different from Japanese, which often writes Chinese characters to represent both native Japanese words and Chinese loanwords.\nNorth Korea.\nIn North Korea, where Korean nationalism became very strong, hanja and many Chinese loanwords were abolished to \"purify\" the Korean language, or to get rid of words from other languages and use native words instead. Nowadays, when North Koreans write in Korean, they only write in hangul.\nKorean names.\nKoreans usually have a one-word family name of Chinese origin and a two-word given name also of Chinese origin. Traditionally, one word in the given name would be the same as all the person's siblings, and the other would be unique to themselves. Examples include Park Geun-hye (hangul: \ubc15\uadfc\ud61c, hanja: \u6734\u69ff\u60e0) and Kim Jong-un (hangul: \uae40\uc815\uc740, hanja: \u91d1\u6b63\u6069). Some Koreans, however, have a two-word family name of Chinese origin, like Namgung (hangul: \ub0a8\uad81, hanja: \u5357\u5bae) and a one-word given name of Chinese origin like in Namkung Do (hangul: \ub0a8\uad81\ub3c4, hanja: \u5357\u5bae\u9053). In other cases, Koreans may have a one-word given name and a one-word family name. An example of this is Go Soo (hangul: \uace0\uc218, hanja: \u9ad8\u6d19). Nowadays, however, it has become more common for Koreans to have their given name be a native Korean word, like Haneul (hanja:\ud55c\uc744, meaning: \"Heaven\"/\"Sky\"), Areum (hanja:\uc544\ub984, meaning: \"Beauty\"), Iseul (hanja:\uc774\uc2ac \"Dew\"), and Seulgi (hanja:\uc2ac\uae30, meaning: \"Wisdom\"). On official documents, Koreans must write their names in hanja and hangul. For native Korean names, Koreans chose hanja that just have the same pronunciation as the word's syllables rather than hanja that have the same meaning."}

When the axiom of choice is added to ZF, the system is called ZFC. It is the system of axioms used in set theory by most mathematicians today.\nAfter Russell's paradox was found in the 1901, mathematicians wanted to find a way to describe set theory that did not have contradictions. Ernst Zermelo proposed a theory of set theory in 1908. In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel proposed a new version based on Zermelo's work.\nAxioms.\nAn axiom is a statement which is accepted without question, and which has no proof. ZF contains eight axioms.\nAxiom of choice.\nThe axiom of choice says that it is possible to take one object out of each of the elements of a set and make a new set. For example, given the set formula_14, the axiom of choice would show that a set such as formula_28 exists. For finite sets, this axiom can be proved from the other axioms, but not for infinite sets."}

The war ended without a clear victory on either side. The Treaty of Mangalore restored the situation to the state before the war broke out. The war involved the Kingdom of Mysore and the British East India Company. The Kingdom of Mysore was a large kingdom, in the South of India. It was an ally of the French. The East India Company was on the side of the English.\nHyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore, committed himself to a French alliance to seek revenge against the British. The British had problems with Mysore because it had an alliance with the French.\nHyder Ali And Tipu Sultan.\nThe army of Hyder was one of the largest armies in India. In 1780, his army swept down the Eastern Ghats (mountains) and burnt the villages. Hyder set about forming a confederacy against the British. This included the French, the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad. Hyder Ali overthrew the government and established his authority over the Mysore state. Hyder Ali tried to made a treaty with the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad, but both of them decided not to take up arms against the British so Hyder Ali ended up fighting the war on his own. Hyder died in 1782 but Tipu Sultan proved to be a worthy successor, He introduced many reforms to overhaul and reorganize the administrative machinery. He also modernized the army.\nThe Treaty.\nThe battle remained indecisive and peace was finally concluded with Tipu on 28 June 1784. The war ended by signing the peace treaty in 1784. The treaty was named as the treaty of Mangalore because the treaty was signed in Mangalore. The Treaty of Mangalore was signed between Tipu Sultan and the British East India Company on 11 March 1784. It was signed in Mangalore and brought an end to the Second Anglo-Mysore War.\nCauses of the war.\nThe British had problems with Mysore because it had an alliance with the French. The Marathas attacked Hyder Ali and the British signed a treaty saying that they would help Hyder, but they never cared to show up. Between 1773 and 1779 Hyder Ali was expanding his kingdom. To counter the British threat, Nana Phadnavis, the Maratha chief minister at Pune formed an alliance with the Marathas, Mysore and the Nizam of Hyderabad."}

Before the fort was built, the place was a center of commercial trade. The fort was built by the Dutch to prevent another rebellion after the local people, led by Guo Huai-yi, went against the Dutch in 1652. The fort was still used as a trade center. The Dutch made the fort with red bricks and mortar, which were a mixture of water, sugar, sticky rice and oyster shells.\nThe Zheng Era (1662~1683).\nIn 1662, Koxinga, the ruler of Zheng dynasty,expelled the Dutch, and the fort was used as his government with the new name Chen-Tien Fu. In 1664, the fort was abandoned as a place of government and was used as a place to store gunpowder.\nThe Qing Era (1683~1895).\nIn 1683, the ruler of Zheng dynasty surrendered to the Qing. In 1721, the fort was damaged when Zhu Yigui led uprising against the government. Also through the following years, the fort was destroyed by several earthquakes only a few walls remained.

The Hai-She Temple was built in honor of God of the Sea.\nThe Japanese Era (1895~1945).\nIn 1895, the Qing lost the First Sino-Japanese War and gave away the territory of Taiwan to Japan. The Japanese began to use the fort as an army hospital. In 1944, the Japanese began to restore the buildings including the walls that the Dutch had built, the Hai-Shen Temple, the Wunchang Pavilion and the Penghu Academy.\nAfter 1945.\nAfter WWII, Japan retreated from Taiwan.

Seismic waves can be caused by underground explosions, volcanic eruptions and man-made explosions that can vibrate the ground. Seismic waves go through the Earth\u2019s layers. The speed of seismic waves depends on the type of materials they meet. When they meet different kind of material, they bounce or go in different directions. Seismic waves can be detected by seismographs.\nCauses.\nSeismic waves are caused by earthquakes, underground explosions, volcanic eruptions and man-made explosions that can vibrate the ground. When earthquakes occur, they release energy in a form of seismic waves. Seismic waves make the ground vibrating to all directions from the starting point of the earthquake.\nTypes.\nSeismic waves are divided into two main types of waves, body waves and surface waves. Body waves go through the Earth, and surface waves go along the Earth\u2019s surface.:40\nBody Waves.\nBody waves travel through the Earth\u2019s interior. Body waves are divided into two types, primary waves and secondary waves.:7\nPrimary Waves (P-waves).\nPrimary waves travel faster than any other waves, so when earthquakes occur primary waves arrive first at the surface. That\u2019s why we call them \u2018primary\u2019.:13\nPrimary waves can go through solids, liquids and gases.:36 Primary waves go 7~8 kilometers per second in solids, but primary waves have different speeds in liquids and gases.\nThe ground moves back and forth in the same direction as the primary waves move. Primary waves repeat squeezing and stretching the ground when they move.:13\nSecondary Waves (S-waves).\nSecondary waves arrive after primary waves. That\u2019s why we call them \u2018secondary\u2019. Secondary waves can go 3~4 kilometers per second. Secondary waves can\u2019t go through air and liquids. They can only go through solids.:43 The ground moves up and down in the right angle to the direction of the secondary waves. Secondary waves temporary change the shape of materials.\nSurface Waves.\nSurface waves travel along the Earth\u2019s surface. They come after the body waves.:43 Surface waves are caused by primary waves and secondary waves when they arrive at the surface.:43 There are two types of surface waves.:43\nRayleigh Waves.\nRayleigh waves were named after John William Strutt Rayleigh. When Raleigh waves travel, the particles move in an oval shape, similar to water waves. The speed of Rayleigh waves depends on the types of solids. Information about Rayleigh waves give us the reason why the ground vibrates. Rayleigh waves are slower than Love waves.:37\nLove Waves.\nLove waves were named after A.E.H. Love.:28 Particles move back and forth at a 90 degree angle to the wave direction.:37 The speed of Love waves depends on the types of solids. We can know the thickness of the Earth\u2019s crust with Love waves. Love waves usually travel faster than the Rayleigh waves.:28\nDetection.\nSeismic waves can be detected and recorded by seismographs.:40-41 Primary waves are recorded faster than secondary waves.:40-41 The period between the arrival time of primary waves and secondary waves is used to find the starting point of the wave.:40-41 We can know about the Earth\u2019s layer through seismic waves."}

He was released on bail (around $66,000) in mid-December, pending trial. Two years later, his case was heard at Branch 28 of Tehran which was presided over by Judge Moghisseh (Summer 2015). He was sentenced to six years in prison and fines for pursuing illegal cinematic activities, launching propaganda against the establishment and hurling insults at sanctities. On appeal, his sentence was changed to three years imprisonment and three years of suspended jail and fines.\nHossein Rajabian was sent to the ward 7 of Evin Prison in Tehran. After spending one third of his total period of imprisonment (that is 11 months), he went on hunger strike to protest against unjust trial, lack of medical facilities, and transfer of his brother to another ward called section 8 of the same prison. During the first hunger strike period, which lasted 14 days, he was transferred to hospital because of pulmonary infection and he could not continue his hunger strike because of the interference of the representative of the prosecutor who was sent as an intermediary. After some time, he sent an open letter to the judicial authorities of Iran and went again on strike which brought him the supports of international artists. After 36 days of hunger strike, he could convince the judicial authorities of Iran to review his case and grant him medical leave for the treatment of his left kidney suffered from infections and blood arising out of hunger strike. he, after a contentious struggle with the judicial officer of the prison was sent to the ward 8 for punishment.\nOfficial reactions of the senior officials of the world.\nAfter imprisonment of Hossein Rajabian, senior officials of the world started to react officially to this sentence. For instance, Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations, issued a special declaration about the human rights in the world. In the ninth page of the annual declaration, he refers to the conditions of Hossein Rajabian in the Iranian prisons, and asks the Iranian authorities to release this filmmaker unconditionally. UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Iran Asma Jahangir, in her annual report called for the unconditional release of Hossein Rajabian and other prisoners in Iran. It can be referred to the protesting speech delivered by , the Canadian Liberal Senator in the senate against the Iranian authorities and in support of Hossein Rajabian. After the imprisonment of Hossein Rajabian, who is a Norwegian an artist and political leader declared her support to him, and asked for unconditional release of him and all artists imprisoned throughout the world. Following that, Philip Luther, the head of Amnesty International published an official video talking about Hossein Rajabian and asked all artists of the world to launch a worldwide campaign to support him. After organizing an international petition by the Amnesty International, Johnny Depp, the American actor, and Peter Gabriel, the well-known musician initiated a campaign with the motto \"Art is not a Crime\" to protest against censorship and support Rajabian and all other imprisoned artists.\nA petition was signed by more than 12,000 people of different human right activists and artists addressing the Iranian authorities to review the judicial case of Rajabian and several other prisoners. Finally, the United Nations Human Rights Committee unanimously passed a resolution against Iranian government for the flagrant violation of human rights as a reaction to the collective hunger strike of Hossein Rajabian and seven other political and ideological prisoners of Evin Prison. Following that, the United States Senate extended the sanctions imposed on Iran for the violation of human rights for another ten years. The citizens of European countries initiated a supporting campaign and a sit-in in front of the Iranian Embassies in different countries while showing his photos. The annual report U.S. Department of State on Human Rights in Iran in 2016, to the situation of prisoner filmmaker Hossein Rajabian.\nMovie release in protest.\nIn protest at his sentence and seizure of his movie materials, Hossein Rajabian released the medium-quality copy of his movie \"\" online."}

He supported simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings as a way to fight the growth of industrial civilization.\nIn the late 1800s, anarchist naturism appeared as the union of anarchist and naturist ideas. The movement was influenced by Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. The movement supported vegetarianism, free love, nudism and an ecological view of the world. Followers viewed nudism as a way of avoiding the artificiality of the industrial modern society. Most of the followers were in Spain, France and Portugal.\nBeliefs.\nAnarcho-primitivists believe that before the widespread use of agriculture, humans lived in egalitarian hunter-gatherer tribes. They believe that after the introduction of agriculture, humans slowly began to become \nobsessed with technology, and divisions of labour began to cause inequality. Primitivists disagree about whether we should return to hunter-gatherer tribes, use permaculture, or both.\nPrimitivists believe, based on anthropological studies, that hunter-gatherer societies are less likely to have war, violence, and disease. Not all anthropologists believe this, however. A notable example would be Jared Diamond, who believes that tribe-based people are more prone to violence than developed states.\nAnarchists are against strong government control, and strive for egalitarian relationships with others. However, Anarcho-primitivists go beyond and apply this to all life, not just human life. Anarcho-primitivists look at the history of human civilization in order to decide how to achieve their goals. They are influenced by the Luddites, and are generally against technology. Anarcho-primitivists appreciate the diversity of life, and believe that humans are damaging it.\nPrimitivists do not believe that a mass society can be free. They believe that the divisions of labour that these industrial societies produce lead to people relying on factories and other people to make their food, clothing, shelter, etc.; thus, forcing them to be a member of the society.\nCriticism.\nA common criticism of the anarcho-primitivist movement is hypocrisy. Critics say that while primitivists reject civilization, they usually live civilized lives and use technology to spread their message. Primitivists like John Zerzan say that using technology is a necessary evil for continuing to promote and discuss important conversations.\nA notable primitivist, Derrick Jensen, rejects the term \"primitivism,\" believing that it is racist way to describe Indigenous Peoples. He now prefers to be called a \"indigenist\" or an \"ally to the indigenous.\"\nAnarchists Wolfi Landstreicher and Jason McQuinn both criticize the movement as romanticizing exaggerations of Indigenous societies. They also claim that primitivists use the appeal to nature fallacy often. In response, primitivist John Zerzan says that the movement is not romanticizing Indigenous Peoples. It is instead promoting the \"mainstream view presented in anthropology and archeology textbooks for the past few decades. It sounds utopian, but it's now the generally accepted paradigm.\""}

Malarvizhi and her best friend Vaishali (Aparna Vinod) lodged a complaint against the college to the Medical Council of India. To save his name, PK(owner of the college) made a deal with the MCI officials to cancel the suspension in exchange for sex with a girl from the college. Vaishali, who was the girl chosen by the officials, was found raped and killed the next morning.

Its name was 'Sporthuis Centrum', which means 'Sport House Centre'. It succeeded and Derksen made 17 more shops in the Netherlands. He then added things used for camping to the range.\nIn 1968, Derksen bought some woodland near Reuver so that his staff and customers could relax in small tents. The park, De Lommerbergen, worked well so the tents were replaced with bungalows. In 1987, Center Parcs opened its first UK resort at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire.

It was near Ollerton and Boughton in Nottinghamshire and named Sherwood Forest. Two years later a second village was added, at Elveden Forest, near Brandon, Suffolk.\nThe third park opened in 1994, on the site of Longleat Safari Park near Warminster, Wiltshire. This village has less lodges than Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest because it is very hilly.\nIn 1997, the Rank Organisation had opened a holiday village near Penrith, Cumbria. They called it Oasis Lakeland Holiday Village. When Center Parcs UK bought it they changed the name to \"Center Parcs Oasis Whinfell Forest\". The middle of the village is under a roof, and there is no country club like at Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest. Center Parcs have changed many Whinfell Forest lodges. They have also added new lodges like the ones at the other parks.\nIn April 2002, the central plaza and sports centre at Elveden Forest was destroyed by a fire. Nobody was badly injured but one man had to be treated because he inhaled smoke. In the summer of 2003, Elveden Forest reopened. Whilst it was closed, the village was rebuilt in a slightly different design. Some lodges were extended and a spa was built.\nThe chief executive, Martin Dalby, said that the company might add a fifth village. In December 2004, Center Parcs said that it had found a place for it near a town called Woburn, Bedfordshire. The estimated project cost ten years before construction was about \u00a3160 million. New lodges, buildings, a pool, a spa and restaurants were built. It was thought that the project would take between three and four years to complete. In September 2007 the company were allowed to build. In 2012 they got \u00a3250 million of investment to build the new resort. It would be called Woburn Forest. It is the smallest Center Parcs UK village and opened in spring 2014.\nIn 2008, Martin Dalby, the chief executive of Center Parcs UK, said that the new village would be the last village the company built in the UK and that if a sixth village was built it would probably be placed in Ireland.\nThe sixth village was announced in September 2015. County Longford Forest will be in Ireland and is going to open in the summer of 2019.\nFacilities.\nPlaces to stay.\nEach village has different lodge types. These can have between one and four bedrooms. Sherwood Forest has just built a lodge with 6 bedrooms. They can hold up to 12 people. Some big lodges have a games room and hot tub. Lodges are usually in small groups and are quite private. Elveden Forest doesn't have any lodges with one bedroom. It has Lakeside Apartments instead, for one to two people.\nIn 2007, Center Parcs began updating all of its lodges. All the beds were replaced. A new kind of 'Woodland Lodge' replaced the old simple lodges to become the least expensive place to stay. The Executive Lodges were also upgraded.\nThings to do.\nGuests can book and take part in a large amount to do at the villages."}

It is now generally considered a language isolate. The Encyclopedia Britannica categorizes it as a Penutian language, and Bertha Dutton once posed the hypothetical that according to the Swadesh list, \"If the Zuni language is a member of the Penutian language family, then it is a distant relative of the Tanoan languages (Tewi).\" The Penutian Hypothesis was advanced by Alfred Kroeber and Roland B. Dixon and later refined by Edward Sapir, and was an attempt to reduce the number of unrelated language families in a culturally diverse area that was centered in California central coast. While this theory was plausible for some of\nthe languages, the problem of verification of this theory was that to find any evidence of any cognates between the California languages and Zuni, one would possibly have to trace the languages' lineage by as much as 3000\u20135000 years or more.\nA bibliography of books and articles concerning the Zuni language lists items dealing with syntax and semantics, as does Zuni\nCurtis D. Cook's article and the work of Stanley Newman. Others, such as Ruth Bunzel's \"Pueblo Pottery\" and Jane M. Young's book on Rock Art, are important in the study of pragmatics and the Zuni World View as it is reflected in the Zuni language. The Zuni worldview may properly be considered as a study in orthology.\nThe form and function of design images and pictographic rock art images and their interpretation according to Zuni mythology\nor cosmology sufficed as a form of communication prior to the appearance of a written language.\n\"The Zuni Enigma\", by Nancy Yaw Davis offers a comparative of cognates between the Zuni language and\nanother language isolate; the Japanese language. While speculative, it demonstrates a likeness between the Zuni and Japanese languages that is more compelling than that of the Penutian Hypothesis. Dell Hymes offers information on California languages where one can form a comparative of certain Zuni words to the languages of California, e.g.Wintu, Maidu, Miwok, and may have relevance to studies of the Pueblo Peoples, the Pecos Classification, and the Hohokam. Also important are the books on and by Frank Hamilton Cushing. He was the first anthropologist to undertake studies by means of the method of Participant observation, and became a member of the Zuni's Priesthood of the Bow during his tenure at the Pueblo from 1879-1884. Of special interest in regard to the Zuni language is his correspondences edited by Jesse Green, and their relevance to the Zuni language as it reflects their world view."}

It is well known for the large role that women play in the movement. The headquarters of the Brahma Kumaris is in Mount Abu, India. It teaches a form of meditation called Raja Yoga Meditation. In 2008, the movement said that it had more than 825,000 members, with over 8,500 centres in 100 countries.\nHistory.\nThe Brahma Kumaris began as a small, caste-specific, spiritual community in Hyderabad, Sindh, India in the 1930s. The community was formally established in 1937, as a trust comprised of young women, but its formation can be traced back to 1932. The precursor to modern-day Sindh was Mohenjo-Daro. One of the world\u2019s most ancient cities, it was the cradle of the Indus Valley. Archeological evidence indicates that region held a progressive society, a well-engineered and designed city. Socially there was equality between women and men, and very low rates of crime.\nBy contrast, in the 1930s in some parts of Sindh many women were in purdah. Even in the contemporary world, some parts of Sindhi society expect women to wear soft shoes so they are not heard, to live behind blinds so they cannot be seen, and to move according to the instructions of a male relative. For some women, even looking at or speaking to a male outside her family is forbidden. These ideas are not native to Sindh but were adopted by Sindh locals upon arrival of Arabian culture. This tension was vibrant during the time of North West India after British colonisation, and just before the partition of India. This was crucial to the development of the Brahma Kumaris.\nThe founder of the Brahma Kumaris was a successful middle-aged jeweler, Lekhraj Koobchand Kripalani, residing in Hyderabad (in pre-Partition India). He was of the Bhaiband caste and born into a family who were devotees of (1479-1531), a Hindu theologian and philosopher. Vallabhacharya taught Shuddha (pure) Advaita (non-dualism), an interpretation of Vedanta that rejected asceticism and monastic life, suggesting that through loving devotion to God any householder could achieve salvation. This understanding influenced the early teachings of the Brahma Kumaris and may be at the heart of its role as a social reform movement."}

Olsen and his neighbour, Patrick J. Madden discovered silver-lead traces on Mr Olsen\u2019s land at Finney\u2019s Hill, Indooroopilly, a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, 10km from the city centre. After some promising excavations all over the property approximately 200 feet above sea level, a mineral lease was granted to them and the first ore recovered from the site was dispatched to Cockle Creek, N.S.W. for smelting.\nThe success of this led to the construction of an underground shaft to commence open-cut mining of the site in 1919. A number of leases were taken out on the property and adjacent land. A year later geophysical prospecting was undertaken, the first record of such a survey being undertaken in Queensland.\nIn 1921, a larger shaft was sunk to recover ore and a small treatment plant was erected in 1924 to facilitate work there. Mining continued with P.J. Madden purchasing the property outright. The existing house on the land, Fernbrook, built by architect, George Addison was demolished.\nBy 1929, the mine ceased operations, due to poor metal prices worldwide and the exhaustion of the higher grade reserve. Total production for the period 1919-1929 had been 227, 343 oz of silver and 1,795 tonnes of lead.\nUniversity of Queensland Experimental Mine.\nOver the next two decades, the mine remained closed. Shafts and tunnels collapsed as timber rotted, and the land was susceptible to flooding from the Brisbane River. The University of Queensland leased the site in 1951, totalling 6 hectares for its Department of Mining. The property was owned by Brisbane City Council, who sold it to the Queensland government. In 1956, the state government provided to mine site to the University granting it permanent and exclusive surface and underground rights. \nThe open-cut and underground workings resumed, offering the University an opportunity to manage it as a working mine and teaching facility. Three shafts exist \u2013 the main shaft sunk to a depth of 290 ft, a ventilation shaft sunk to 150 ft and an inclined shaft sunk 65 degrees horizontal to the mine\u2019s 140 ft level. This was established by students of the Colombo Plan to gain experience.\nThe mine operates today as part of the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre."}

This was because there were many shipwrecks near the area, including the American Rover incident. The lighthouse took twenty years to build. Aboriginal tribes had also attacked the lighthouse because they did not want it on their land. Because of that, the Chinese military had to guard the area. The lighthouse is the only armed lighthouse in Taiwan. During World War II, while under Japanese rule, there were many bombings on the lighthouse during the Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa. The lighthouse was soon rebuilt.\nKenting National Park was created in 1984 by Chiang Ching-kuo. The area had damage from farming and building, so it was created to protect the land.\nIn 2001, a Greek ship, the \"Amorgos\", lost power while sailing to China close to the park. In 2010, the hull of the ship split. It spilt 1100 tonnes of oil which collected around the park's shoreline. It caused major damage to the sea and wildlife. Almost of the shore was affected by the spill. It affected 200 bird species and 2200 plant species in the park. It killed many crabs, fish, and clams.\nGeography.\nKenting is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean in the east, the Taiwan Strait in the west and the Bashi Channel in the south. The park covers almost .

During the Japanese rule, whaling caused disappearances of the whales. There aren't any whales in the area now.\nDuring the fall and the winter, a lot of migrating birds fly to the park to rest and feed. Almost 235 of the species of birds come to the park during this time.\nClimate.\nThe park has a tropical climate. It has warm and hot weather for the whole year. The temperature in January is .

His parents were Keoua and Keku\u2018iapoiwa II. They were cousins. Their grandfather was Keawe\u2018ikekahiali\u2018iokamoku, who had been the boss (\"ali\u2018i nui\") of the big island of Hawaii. When Keawe\u2018ikekahiali\u2018iokamoku died, there was a civil war. Keoua and his brother Kalani\u2018opu\u2018u lost, and Alapa\u2018inui won. Keoua lived with Alapa\u2018inui for a while, but he died when Kamehameha was still a little boy. Kamehameha left and lived with his uncle Kalani\u2018opu\u2018u. \nLeader on Hawaii Island.\nWhen Kamehameha's uncle died in 1782, his cousin Kiwala\u2018o became the new boss of the big island of Hawaii. Kamehameha became the head priest for the Hawaiian god of war Kuka\u2018ilimoku and the leader of the Waipi\u2018o Valley. He and his cousin started to fight because Kamehameha showed more respect to the gods than to his cousin. Some leaders in Kona joined him. They beat Kiwala\u2018o at the Battle of Moku\u2018ohai, and Kamehameha became the leader of Kona, Kohala, and Hamakua on Hawaii Island.\nAt that time, there were people who said that they could see the future. They told a prophecy that Kamehameha would bring Hawaii together and even unite the people of Polynesia as far away as the Maoris in New Zealand. Kamehameha began to plan to unite all the kingdoms of the different islands. He started buying guns and bullets from British and American sailors who came to Hawaii while they hunted whales. Captain Brown began to bring him gunpowder from China and taught him how to it from sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal on Hawaii. Isaac Davis and John Young stayed on Hawaii, married Hawaiian women, and taught Kamehameha's men how to use and fix guns.\nKamehameha took Puna from its leader Keawema\u2018uhili in 1790. Keoua Ku\u2018ahu\u2018ula tried to take over his land while he was busy fighting, but Kamehameha was able to come back with his men in time. Keoua Ku\u2018ahu\u2018ula ran away past the volcano Kilauea and lost many men because of poison gas. The next year, Kamehameha invited him to visit. When Keoua Ku\u2018ahu\u2018ula came, he and his protectors were all killed. Kamehameha was now the boss of the big island of Hawaii.\nWar with other islands.\nKamehameha now had 960 war canoes and about 10,000 men. He took Maui and Molokai at the Battle of Kawela in 1795. \nKamehameha then attacked Oahu, landing his men at Wai\u2018alae and Waikiki. His helper Ka\u2018iana was really helping his enemy Kalanikupule. He helped make special safe places for Kalanikupule's cannon on top of the Pali Mountains. This caused Kamehameha to lose many men until he sent many to climb the other side of the mountains and hit the cannon from behind. 400 Oahu men were forced over the side of the mountains' cliff. Ka\u2018iana was killed in the battle, and Kalanikupule was caught and given as a gift to the war god Kuka\u2018ilimoku.\nKamehameha got Kaumuali\u2018i, the leader of Kauai, to work for him in April 1810 and, in this way, at last became the only leader of all the Hawaiian Islands. Other angry leaders wanted to kill Kaumuali\u2018i with poison at a big dinner but Isaac Davis heard about their plan and told him ahead of time.\nLeader of the Hawaiian Islands.\nKamehameha made Kamakahonu in Kona his home after about 1812. He wanted the Hawaiian Islands to stay together after he died. He made all the islands use the same laws. He used his taxes to increase the islands' trade with Europe and the United States. He thought about bringing in Christianity to the islands, but decided that the Hawaiian gods that he had followed so far were strong in spirit and had brought him his success. He had somewhere between 20 and 30 wives and about 35 children, including 17 sons and 18 daughters. \nDeath.\nKamehameha died on May 8 or 14, 1819. No one is sure where his body was put, because the Hawaiians thought people could use the spiritual power of the dead and the king's close friends Hoapili and Ho\u2018olulu hid his body carefully. His children by his wife Keopuolani followed him as the leaders of Hawaii and are known as the House of Kamehameha."}

Daqing is a prefecture-level city, which means it ranks below a province and above a county. The city is called the \"Oil Capital of China\" because oil was discovered at the Daqing Oil Field in 1959. It is one of China's most well-known places because of this.\nThe population of Daqing was 2,963,458 in 2010. Close to 1,400,000 people lived in the urban parts of town.\nHistory.\nIn 1898, Russia built the Chinese Eastern Railway in the area. There is a station called Sartu in the area that is still in use.\nIn 1959, oil was found in the Daqing Oil Field. It stopped the oil shortage in China. It was the largest oil field in the 1960s to the 1980s. It has 48 oil and gas fields. In 1960, the oil field began production. Over the next 50 years, the oil field produced over 50 million tons of oil. It has produced more than 40% of China's oil exports. It is the second most productive oil and gas field in China.\nIn 1959, a town close to the Daqing Oil Field was created. It was to house workers and to help companies and industries use the resources. In 1960, another city was created nearby, named Anda City. This city controlled the Daqing Oil Field area. The town grew too large eventually and became a special administrative region. In 1979, the city was renamed Daqing, after the oil field.\nIn the 1960s, Mao Zedong said the slogan \"In industry, learn from Daqing\". It meant that Daqing was very important for the Chinese industry. Daqing oil workers set an example for how cities in China should be.\nDaqing has protested the Chinese government sometimes. In 2002, close to 100,000 oil workers from Daqing and Liaoyang gathered to protest how the government handled money and paid them. In 2017, there were plans to build an aluminum plant in Daqing. Thousands of people protested against the plans.\nGeography.\nDaqing is in the Songnen Plain, in a flat area. It has an average elevation of . The city is southeast of Harbin and northwest of Qiqihar.\nEconomy.\nDaqing's economy is mainly based on oil and petroleum. There are lots of major pipelines that transport oil to and from the rest of China and Russia. In 2013, Russia agreed to send oil to China. That oil will be going through the pipeline to Daqing. Close to 60% of the gross domestic product (GDP) was because of petroleum and oil exports. Daqing had a GDP of 298 billion renminbi in 2015.\nDaqing exports over 10 million tonnes of oil each year. Wax, tar, and benzene were also exported to countries including the United States. The main exports are oil and gas, construction materials, food, and furniture.\nTransportation.\nDaqing is a major railway stop in Heilongjiang. It connects two major railways, the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway and the Tongliao-Ranghulu Railway. It also has three major railway stations. Daqing also has an airport, the Daqing Sartu Airport. It opened on 1 September 2009. It has flights to large cities like Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. Daqing is linked to the Chinese highway network through the G45 Daqing-Guangzhou Expressway and the G10 Suifenhe-Manzhouli Expressway."}

These 304 days were followed by an unnamed 50-day winter period. The Roman king Numa Pompilius (c. 715-673 BC) introduced February and January (in that order) between December and March, increasing the length of the year to 354 or 355 days. In 450 BC, February was moved to its current position between January and March.\nIn order to make up for the lack of days in a year, an extra month, Intercalaris or Mercedonius, (allegedly with 22 or 23 days) was introduced in some years. In an 8 year period the length of the years were:\n1: 12 months or 355 days\n2: 13 months or 377 days\n3: 12 months or 355 days\n4: 13 months or 378 days\n5: 12 months or 355 days\n6: 13 months or 377 days\n7: 12 months or 355 days\n8: 13 months or 378 days\nA total of 2930 days corresponding to a year of 366\u00bc days. This year was discovered to be too long, and therefore 7 days were later dropped from the 8th year, yielding 365.375 days per year.\nIt was the duty of the priesthood not to have any mistake of the intercalary month. However, leap years were considered unlucky. Therefore, they were avoided in time of crisis, such as the Second Punic War. In order to fix the problem, Julius Caesar made his famous calendar reform in 45 BC."}

G. Wells. Wells only produced one episode of the American radio drama anthology series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". This episode was produced as the Halloween episode. It was broadcast on Sunday, October 30, 1938. It became famous for allegedly causing mass panic, although the scale of the panic is disputed as the program had relatively few listeners.\nThe first two-thirds of the one-hour broadcast was presented as a series of simulated news bulletins. The first news update interrupted a program of dance music to report that a series of odd explosions had been spotted on Mars, which was followed soon thereafter by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Martians emerged from the object and attacked using a heat ray during the next interruption, which was followed by a rapid series of news reports describing a devastating alien invasion taking place across the United States and the world. The illusion of realism was increased because the \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\" was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes into the broadcast. Popular legend holds that all of the radio audience may have been listening to Edgar Bergen and tuned in to \"The War of the Worlds\" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction that the show was a drama, but research beginning in the 2010s suggests this only happened in rare instances.In the days following the adaptation, widespread outrage was expressed in the media. The program's news-bulletin format was described as deceptive by some newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the perpetrators of the broadcast and calls for regulation by the Federal Communications Commission. The episode secured Welles' fame as a dramatist."}

It is the largest lake in Taiwan. Sun Moon Lake is one of the Eight Views of Taiwan. The lake was named because the east side of the lake looks like a sun, and the west side of the lake looks like a moon.\nThe lake is famous because the scenery looks very beautiful. In the morning and evening, there are clouds and mist with the rising or setting sun. The area around the lake is one of Taiwan's national scenic areas.\nHistory.\nThe land around the lake is home to the Thao tribe. They are an aboriginal people. According to legend, Thao hunters discovered Sun Moon Lake after chasing a deer. The deer led them to the lake. They found that the lake was beautiful and had lots of fish. An island in the middle of the lake is thought of as the worship place for the Thao people.\nThe lake was called Lake Candidius in the past. It was named after the missionary Georgius Candidius. The lake was first called Sun Moon Lake in 1821, in a book called \"Travels to Shueilishe\" by Deng Chuan-an. In the Qing dynasty, Chinese people began moving to the area around Sun Moon Lake. Many people wanted to open restaurants, hotels, and stores there.\nWhen Taiwan was ruled by Japan, they made many changes. The first power plants were built in 1934. It was being built for 15 years and the project began in 1919. The Jiji Line railroad was built to help the construction of the power plants. Lalu Island was renamed \"Jade Island\". The Japanese built a large dam in 1931 that made the lake much bigger. In 1946, the new Chinese government renamed the lake \"Kuanghua Island\". The name stayed that way until the 921 earthquake in 1999 that damaged the island. After the earthquake, the island was renamed Lalu Island. It was renamed because the Taiwanese government wanted to help preserve the Thao culture.\nIn 1967, an Aboriginal Culture Centre was created to help preserve the Thao culture. In 1975, the centre was opened. In 1990, a yacht turned upside down while in the water. It caused 57 people to die. Only 25 people survived. In 2012, a picture of Sun Moon Lake was used in the People's Republic of China passports. It made the Taiwanese government angry because they say that Taiwan and Sun Moon Lake is not part of the People's Republic of China.\nGeography.\nSun Moon Lake is above sea level. It is deep. Many mountains and forests are around the lake.\nThe water of the lake is very clear and crystal-like. There is an island in the middle of the lake that is called Lalu Island. The public is not allowed on the island because it is only allowed for aboriginal uses.\nClimate.\nSun Moon Lake is in a warmer area. The average temperature there is 21\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAttractions.\nThere are many museums and monuments around the lake. The town Ita Thao has many shops and businesses. They are mainly owned by people of the Thao tribe. The Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village is very close to Sun Moon Lake. It opened in 1986 and helps teach about Aboriginal culture. It has beautiful gardens and forests. There is a gondola that people ride over the forests next to the lake.\nPeople can ride bicycles around the lake. There are many bike trails around the lake. There are also many hiking trails around the lake that go up Mount Maolan."}

Her parents were Daniel and Monica. Shortly after her birth, her parents went to Burma with family. So Kuntala Kumari passed her early childhood at Burma with her parents. Then she returned to Khurda with her mother Monica after her father got remarried at Burma. So Kuntala Kumari stayed at Khurda with her mother for a short period. She completed her early school education at Ravenshaw Girl\u2019s School and higher study at Medical School, Cuttack. Kuntala Kumari composed poems during her school days. She came out successfully from the medical school and became popular as a doctor with her sincerity and simplicity. Although a physician by profession, she knew the colonial treatment of the anatomy of an enslaved nation better than her own degree.\nKailash Rao was her literary teacher who guided her literary activities. Kuntala Kumari enrolled herself as a member of \u2018Nava Vidhan\u2019, the \u2018Brahmo Society\u2019. She got wide applause when poems, \u2018Anjali\u2019 came out. She won approbation from almost all the literary figures of Orissa. A leading cultural association of women conferred on her the title \u2018Utkal Bharati\u2019. Gopal Chandra Praharaj and Pallikabi Nanda Kishore Bal loved her and adopted her as their daughter. Kuntala Kumari joined a maternity welfare centre, which was newly opened at Cuttack in 1925. Later she left for Delhi on 1st July 1928. The same year she got married to Krishna Prasad. New phase of life began, yet she did not leave her writings. She had written in English, Kuntala Kumari Sabat : A True Patriotic Litterateur and Reflection of Her Literary Works on Gandhian Movement Dr. Janmejay Choudhury Bengali and Hindi and contributed to a number of nonOriya journals and edited a number of Hindi journals at Delhi. During her stay at Delhi, she presided over the \u2018All India Arya Mahila Sammilani\u2019 at Bareli. During this time also she was invited by the Allahabad University and Benaras Hindu University to deliver lectures. She was the president of the students federation at Aligarh. She was made the chair-person of a reputed social organisation founded by Harbilash Sarada for the introduction of widow marriage and abolition of child marriage. While at Delhi she took steps to encourage, publish and project Oriya literature. At Delhi, Kuntala Kumari was also associated with eminent writers like , Yeasshpal Jee Jain, S.H. Batsayan and a host of Hindi writers. \u2018Hindi Pracharini Sabha\u2019 conferred on her the title of \u2018Bharat Kavinetri.\u2019\nAs a disciple of Gandhi she claimed independence as the birth right of Indian people. She took up the task of awakening the women. She encouraged them to join the National Movement under Gandhian leadership.

She was the voice of modern Orissa. In a real sense she was a visionary and a rebel. She expressed her concern for the suffering mankind and wanted to free mankind from exploitation\nNo doubt, Kuntala Kumari had a lot of patriotic fervour in her. She had derived a special pride in herself by portraying Gandhi, Nehru and the spinning wheel in her lucid poems. This instilled a lot of confidence to visualise a free India through the veil of the darkened British rule. She was imbibed with the true spirit of a colonial poet\u2019s vision to awaken public consciousness like Bankim\u2019s immortal Bengali song. The Oriya youths plunged headlong into the noncooperation movement being addicted to her war songs. It ignited the sparks in them spontaneously, so to say rapidly. Although Kuntala Kumari had a brief span of life time of thirty eight years, her creations outlived her to pioneer the cause of rooting out British misrule in India. She composed beautiful numerous patriotic poems and songs. Her first collection of poems came out in 1922. Then it was followed by \u2018Uchhwas\u2019 \u2013 1924, \u2018Archana\u2019 \u2013 1927, \u2018Sphulinga\u2019 \u2013 1929, \u2018Ahwan\u2019 \u2013 1930, \u2018Prem Chintamani\u2019 \u2013 1930, \u2018Oriyanka Kandana\u2019 \u2013 1937, \u2018Garjat Krishaka\u2019 \u2013 1939.4 Her live for man, nature and nation is reflected in her poems. She had a deep hatred for superstitions and conventions, raised her voice against high and mighty. She always tried to protest against injustice and inequalities. She renounced the heartless religious dogmas and practices. She comprehends the image of glorious past of Orissa. At times it carries the romantic strain of love for liberty, equality and fraternity.\nShe composed the inaugural song of \u2018Utkal Sammilani\u2019, chaired by Acharya P.C. Roy in 1924. the poems in the anthology \u2018Archana\u2019 echoes the voice of poor and lowly, the depressed and the marginalized. Her poetic longing for brave new world is expressed in most of her poems. Some of her poems published in \u2018Sphulinga\u2019, inspired the youth of Orissa and infused dynamism in them. The volume \u2018Ahwan\u2019 captures the spirit of Gandhi\u2019s clarion call to people to join the struggle for freedom. In her poems \u2018Sphulinga\u2019 she wants to inspire his fellowmen to get lessons from the history and to get out of the present set up and dullness. Her poems in Ahwan created tremendous sensation. Her fame as a patriot and poet spread over the country. She had a transterrestrial longing for an ideal world, a golden era ruled by love, justice and beauty. The yearning for liberty is always marked in her poems like \u2018Garjat Krishaka\u2019. She expressed the poetic anguish over a cause of the elitish exploitation on the toiling mass. The entire gamut of Kuntala Kumari\u2019s poetic works oscillate between her love for her land and people and the love for God. The poetic identification with the sufferings of common men presents twofold note at one moment she protests and revolts and at the next, she discovers the mystical design in everything and everywhere. In nature, and all its creation see could she the face of God. Her poetry, in some degree, reveals all the romantic traits : \u201cLove of nature, love of beauty, imagination, love of past and a wearied sadness.\u201d No doubt she has enriched the Oriya literature by her pen. Her commitment to explore the possibilities of a free world with faith in love, beauty, truth, goodness and wisdom. Her noble sentiments and her feelings for the sublime have given her poems a universal appeal. Her writings were regularly published in the \u2018Samaj\u2019 and \u2018Sahakar\u2019 under the title \u2018Delhi letters\u2019. She expresses the socio-political life of pre-independent India and makes a zealous attempts to reform the tradition ridden society. In the novel, \u2018Na-tundi\u2019, She expresses real thing of the land. \u2018Raghu Arakhit\u2019 is one of her most outstanding works. It narrates the social character regarding marriage, where a compensation was given to the bride\u2019s family.\nKuntala Kuamri\u2019s voice was more reflected in her poetry anthologies AHWAN (the call) and Gadajata Krishaka (Feudatory Farmer). The following stanza provides enough stimulus to adorn the spirit of mankind. Oh ! my compatriot !! The man is not born to die of reminiscence or to sink in somewhere It is never a human fate That gets terminated through a happiness living After being condemned to the fretful glooms of failure in a deprived morbid prison of ever \u2013 disciplined humiliating; Thus great Earth is never a decaying caravan or a lady nurturing death. Her poetry was a great leap towards strengthening the debilitation of Oriya race against the mighty Britishers. It is definitely a great voice to heal up the wounded psyche of several Oriyas condemned to a bonded earth under \u2018British Raj\u2019.6 She was a rebel no doubt and simultaneously a visionary. She stirred the conscience of the people through her writings. Her poems kindled a new spirit in the hearts of the people and inspired them to fight relentlessly against the Britishers.\nOne of the session of Utkal Sammilani was held at Balasore on 2nd August 1931 with Kuntala Kumari in chair. Jahnabi Devi was the chairperson of the reception. Nearly twelve hundred people all over Orissa attended. This meeting was also attended by more than a thousand women. In her speech as the chairman of the Reception Committee Jahnabi Devi refuted the universally accepted view of women\u2019s inability to stand on their own.8 In this session a central executive committee, named \u201cAll Orissa Women\u2019s Association\u201d was set up. Here sincere efforts were made to work out a programme for the improvement of condition of women of Orissa. In an essay entitled \u201cKabi O Lekhakara Udeshya\u201d, she raised the status of a poet by declaring that she is not limited to any time and clime. A true creative artist moves high above such human limitations : \u201cThe poet or the writer is nature\u2019s representative. He is not confined to any particular nation or time. He belongs to all the nations, to all time and all humanity.9 Her death on 23rd August 1938 was a great loss for the people of Orissa. Her brief life was a saga of relentless struggle against evil and darkness. She was a talented woman poet from Orissa, second to none in her bold utterances for the cause of Indian freedom. Although she spent major part of her short life outside the state, she had enough inclination to intercede the causes of its Gods and Goddesses, aquatic landscapes, rural surroundings, and the people irrespective of rich and poor alike. Therefore, time and tide has not thrown her into the limbo of oblivion. Her ideas and concern for common man got reflected in her works. Her life and creatives made her a legendary personality in her lifetime itself. She championed the cause of a world-free from evil and injustice. Her passion for justice, equality, liberty and fraternity was astounding. Throughout her life she fought against injustice and exploitation."}

The park is home to two-thirds of the world's great one-horned rhinoceroses. It is a World Heritage Site. It was named a Tiger Reserve by the government of India and an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.\nKaziranga is home to large breeding populations of tigers, elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. One type of swamp deer now only exists in the park.\nHistory.\nThe Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest was created in 1905. Mary Curzon, the wife of the Viceroy of India, wanted the area protected mostly to save the rhinoceros. In 1908, Kaziranga was designated a \"Reserve Forest\". In 1916 it was renamed \"Kaziranga Game Sanctuary\" then changed to \u201cWild Life Sanctuary\u201d in 1950.\nGeography.\nThe park is located in both the Nagaon district and Golaghat district, in the state of Assam in India. It is about 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) long and 13 kilometres (8\u00a0mi) wide.\nThe park is crossed by four main rivers \u2014 Brahmaputra, Diphlu, Mora Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri. There are also many small water bodies.\nThe park is within the Brahmaputra floodplain. This means when the water in the river rises, the park is partially covered in water. Flooding happens every year which results in over half the park being underwater. In 2017, 85% of the park was underwater. At least 107 animals died because of the flooding in 2017. There are elevated areas of the park which provide retreats and shelter for animals during floods. These are called \"chapories\". Many artificial \"chapories\" have been built with the help of the Indian Army to ensure the safety of the animals.\nClimate.\nThe park has three seasons: winter, summer, and monsoon. The winter season is between November and February. It is mild and dry. The small water bodies dry up and short grass covers the bed. The summer season between March and May is hot. The animals can be found near water during these months. The rainy monsoon season lasts from June to September.\nFauna.\nKaziranga National Park is home to 35 major mammals. This includes 15 mammals under the highest protection in India. The One-Horned rhinoceros, Royal Bengal Tiger, Asian elephant, wild water buffalo and swamp deer are collectively known as the 'Big Five' of Kaziranga. In addition there are \ngaur, sloth bears, clouded leopards, wild boar, and several deer species. Small mammals include the rare hispid hare, mongoose, civet, pangolin, and badgers. The park also is home to several primates. These include macaques, lutungs, the Bengal slow loris, and the only ape in India - the hoolock gibbon. Kaziranga's rivers are home to the endangered Ganges dolphin.\nMore than 490 bird species live in Kaziranga which includes 24 globally threatened species. The park is known for its nesting colonies of Spot-billed Pelicans and Adjutants. Waterfowl which breed in or pass through Kaziranga include several rare species of geese (lesser white-fronted goose), and ducks (ferruginous pochard, Baer's pochard). Other rare riverine birds include kingfishers, herons, shanks, and terns. Raptors include the rare eastern imperial eagle, other eagles, and the lesser kestrel.\nTwo of the largest snakes in the world, the reticulated python and the rock python, are common inside the park. It is also home to the king cobra, Indian cobra, Russell's viper, and common krait. Fifteen species of turtle live in Kaziranga. 42 species of fishes are found in the Kaziranga area, including the unusual ocellated pufferfish.\nFlora.\nThere are four main types of plant life in Kaziranga National Park. These are alluvial inundated grasslands, alluvial savanna woodlands, tropical moist mixed deciduous forests, and tropical semi-evergreen forests. Percent coverage by vegetation is: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%."}

There are different kinds of stressors that animals can be exposed to, and there are different kinds of stress responses that animals display as a result. Physiological changes that happen because of stress cause behavioural responses in animals. There are different types of behavioural responses: impairment of response inhibition and lack of motivation, changes in social, sexual, aggression and nurture behaviour in animals. The extent of the impact is dependent upon the type, and duration of the stress, as well as the past experiences of the animal. Behavioural responses to prolonged stress can also be transferred across generations.\nOverview.\nStress responses are any responses that an organism makes or goes through, in response to a stressor that is causing a stress. A stress in accordance to Walter Cannon (1871-1945), is any disturbance that imbalances the internal environment of an organism also known as homeostasis. There are two major types of stressors that cause stress to animals: abiotic stressors and biotic stressors. Abiotic stressors are any ecological, geological, or climatological changes, that causes stress to the animal such as increased temperatures, and natural disasters. Biotic stressors are living things-related complications that causes stress; these include dominance, pollution, infection social pressures and competition.\nThere are different types of stress responses in an animal in response to stressors: Physiological responses, Behavioural responses, Psychological responses, and/or Physical responses (fight or flight). The response depends on the choice the animal partakes in, when it is faced with danger that causes distress. Walter Canon (1871-1945), argues that there are two possible choices that an organism may choose when stress is encountered: fight or flight responses; the choice is based on careful evaluation of the situation that would derive a response.\nBehavioural responses.\nBehavioural responses to stress, are evoked from some underlying complex physiological changes that arise consequently from stress. There are many different types of behavioural responses to stress:\nAccording to a study conducted by Mika and his colleagues, prolonged stress in rats causes response inhibition. It was evident through their experiment that stressed rats had inhibited premature responses (decreased timing of intervals to food), along with decreased intrinsic motivation to initiate a response. They link the decreased motivation to the stress-associated reduction in incentive motivation, as presented by another study conducted by Kleen and his colleagues. Decreased motivation was also seen in a study conducted by Beery and Kaufer, where they explained that stressed rodents are less likely to be motivated to interact with one another.\nA study conducted by Beery and Kaufer, revealed that social behaviours in rodents change in response to stress. They explain that social withdrawal and general reduction in social interaction after an exposure to a stressor are evident in rodents. They argue that this is due to the underlying physiological changes that the rodent goes through in response to stress. For instance, the changes that occur to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, is directly related to the changes in social behaviour. Social avoidance is another consequence of stress that can be seen in rodents. Rodents are more likely to avoid dominant rats and avoid social interactions amongst each other after the exposure to a stressor.\nSexual interests change in many species when exposed to stressors. For instance, stressed male and female rats express inhibited mating behaviour which is evident through the clear increase in the inhibitory hormone RF-amide. Another study suggests that masculine sexual behaviour in male rats is subject to changes in accordance to the type of stressors that the rats were subjected to. Female Zebra Finches mating choice is determined by the stressors that they are exposed to early in life, which remains consistent throughout adulthood. A study about stress effects on female songbird\u2019s response to sexual signal for mating, indicated that the response to this specific signal can be impaired if the female is exposed to developmental stress. Behavioural changes as a result from developmental stress impairs neural responses to sexual signal, which reduces mating:\nStressed animals would choose to avoid a novel situation rather than confront it. Aggressive behaviour is associated with sex hormones, such as testosterone, and specific brain regions and systems such as the medial preoptic nucleus, prefrontal cortex-dependent response inhibition, and anterior hypothalamus. Stress negatively impacts sex hormones, which results in an imbalance and reduction in aggression related hormones and function. Also, chronic stress results in prefrontal cortex-dependent response inhibition. This results in reduction in aggression, thus promoting anti-predator responses.\nProlonged stress alters parental behaviour toward offspring and promotes parental neglect. According to a study performed by Tilgar and associates, predation stress alters parents\u2019 behaviours such as the reduction in provisioning rates, which negatively impacts the offspring\u2019s performance. Oxytocin and vasopressin hormones are generally responsible for affiliative and pair-bonding behaviours in many species. Stress alters the level of both hormones resulting in an abnormal behaviour from parents towards offspring. For instance, levels of oxytocin decrease as a result of prolonged stress, which has been shown to reduce pair bonding behaviour and increase withdrawal behaviour. Also, prolactin is another important hormone that is associated with nurture by parents to offspring, and levels of this hormone can be altered as a result of stress. Reduced levels of prolactin as a result of stress decreases behaviours such as suckling, licking, and brooding.\nTransgenerational behavioural response to stress.\nBehavioural response to stress can be transmitted from parents to offspring. When an offspring observes the expression of behaviour such as fear in response to a stress stimulus, the same response would be elicited in the offspring when the stimulus is presented. Using Rodent model, Debeik and associates illustrated that fear is transferred from mother to infant in response to a certain odour stimulus. They further proved that the neural activity, such as the basal amygdala activity of the offspring\u2019s brain, illustrated fear response. Therefore, parents\u2019 behavioural response to stress can be transgenerational and can be proven via neural activity."}

It is the fourth national park in Taiwan ever created. It is the third-biggest national park in Taiwan. It features the Taroko Gorge.\nThe park is well known because it has beautiful mountains and cliffs.\nHistory.\nThe meaning of \"Taroko\" is magnificent or beautiful in the Truku language.\nThe area in and around the park was created by the Liwu River. The river slowly cut through the rock to create the gorge.\nThe Atayal and the Sedek tribes came to the area over 300 years ago. Researchers found more than 70 villages from the tribes. There was a trail to Taroko called the Northern Road. The Qing Dynasty helped improve it. The Japanese then built a road system along the coast.\nGold mining began in the area in the 17th century. It happened when the Dutch ruled Taiwan, during the Qing Dynasty, and when the Japanese ruled Taiwan. When the Japanese ruled Taiwan, they began mining the gold in the Liwu River. It began in 1918. There were plans to mine more gold in a shorter time, but World War II started and it didn't happen. Soon, when the Kuomintang ruled over Taiwan, they banned gold mining.\nThe park was first created in 1937 when Taiwan was ruled by the Japanese. When they created it, it was called Tsugitaka-Taroko National Park. When the Chinese government came back to Taiwan in 1945, they closed down the national park. In the 1950s, Chiang Kai-shek wanted a road that crossed Taiwan from west to east. In 1960, this road was opened, called the Central Cross-Island Highway.\nIt runs through the Taroko Gorge.\nThe park was created again in 1986. It was important because it showed that the Taiwanese government knew that they were damaging the environment.\nGeography.\nThe park has many rivers, waterfalls, and gorges. It has of cliffs. It also has 27 of the \"100 Peaks of Taiwan\", which includes Mount Nanhu. Mount Nanhu is high and the fifth tallest mountain in Taiwan. The area has a lot of marble and it also has the only jade found in Taiwan.\nThe park is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean in the east, the Dajia River in the north, and the Zhoushui River in the west. The park covers around of land and covers Hualien County, Taichung, and Nantou.\nThe Taroko Gorge is long.\nClimate.\nIn October to April, the temperature is around . In May to September, the temperature is around .\nBiodiversity.\nThere are 152 kinds of birds, 46 kinds of mammals, 35 kinds of reptiles, and 21 kinds of fish in the park. They include the Formosan wild boar and the Formosan monkey.\nAttractions.\nTaroko National Park has many monuments and attractions to help people learn about the Truku people and people that built the Highway. They include the Eternal Spring Shrine (also called the Changchun Shrine), and the Taroko village. In the park, many people come to hike. There are many hiking trails in the park.\nThe Eternal Spring Shrine was built to honour the 226 people who died building the Central Cross-Island Highway. It has two waterfalls coming out from the building. There are many hiking trails that begin there. There is also a cave with statues in it."}

They followed God's instructions and built a large boat, the arc, in time to survive the flood, but Canaan drowned instead.\nCanaan is the son of Noah, son of Lamech, son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel, son of Kenan, son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam father of humans.\nAccording to the Koran, Noah asked Canaan to come with him on the boat, but Canaan decided to climb a mountain instead\u02d0 \"O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers.\" Canaan said, \"I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.\" Noah said, \"There is no protector today from the decree of The Lord our God, except from whom He gives mercy.\" Then the Koran says Canaan drowned.\nSome versions ( Christian/Jews) say Noah's wife, Canaan's mother, went to the mountain with Canaan because she loved him so much. In this version, Canaan is still a boy small enough to be picked up. It says when the water came, Canaan's mother held him above her head so he would live longer before he drowned.\nOther versions of Canaan.\nThe holy books of the Jews, Christians and Muslims also talk about Canaan son of Ham, Noah's grandson.

If you were to put a superconductor in the field of a big magnet and you looked just inside the superconductor, you would see that the magnetic field was much smaller than it was outside. The deeper in you looked, the closer it would be to zero. This is one of the ways that superconductors are not the same as perfect conductors, which do let magnetic fields pass through them.\nThe effect was discovered by Walter Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld in 1933. They saw that because the magnetic field cannot go through the superconductor, the field right outside the superconductor becomes stronger.\nOne example of the Meissner effect is a magnet levitating above a superconducting plate cooled by liquid nitrogen. In order to stop the magnetic field from going into the superconductor, the superconductor acts like a magnet pointing the opposite direction. This repels the real magnet and stops it from coming any closer."}

After Geneva and Lausanne, it is the third-largest city in the French-speaking part of the country. As of December 2016, 38,965 people lived there.\nThe famous architect Le Corbusier, the writer Blaise Cendrars and the car maker Louis Chevrolet were born there.\nIn 2009, La Chaux-de-Fonds and Le Locle, its sister city, have jointly been awarded UNESCO World Heritage status for their exceptional universal value.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1656. The region was first inhabited around 10,000 years ago (Epipaleolithic). A skull and other traces have been found in caves nearby.\nIn the middle of the 14th century, the region was colonized from the southern Val-de-Ruz. La Chaux-de-Fonds is first mentioned in 1350 as \"la Chaz de Fonz\". In 1378 it was mentioned as \"Chault de Font\".\nThe region was under the authority of the lords of Valangin. In the 15th and 16th centuries, a second wave of colonization came from the so-called \"Clos de la Franchise\" (the valleys of Le Locle and La Sagne). Agriculture was the main activity but the village remained small. In 1531 there were only about 35 people living there. The first church was built in 1528. By 1530, La Chaux-de-Fonds, like the rest of the Valangin lands, converted to the new Reformed faith. The Lord of Valanginian, Ren\u00e9 de Challant, fixed the boundaries of the parish in 1550. The church and parish provided a political structure and a small community of Valanginian citizens, free farmers and peasants grew up around the church. By 1615 there were 355 people living in the village. In 1616, the low and middle jurisdiction over La Chaux-de-Fonds moved to Le Locle and La Sagne, while the high court remained in Valanginian. The agriculture, supplemented by mills on the banks of the Doubs, continued to dominate. However, at the end of the 16th century, the city became an important crossroad between Neuch\u00e2tel, Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the Bishopric of Basel.\nThe community grew during the Thirty Years' War, mainly because of its strategic position for trade. Economic activity accelerated in the 18th century with the development of the city's lace and watchmaking industries. Pierre Jacquet-Droz, best known for his automata, was a particularly prominent watchmaker of this era.\nIn 1794, the city was devastated by fire. Charles-Henri Junod created the new city's plan in 1835, and the city is now known for its \"modern,\" grid-like plan, in comparison with most European cities' meandering streets. The central avenue is named the Avenue L\u00e9opold Robert.\nEconomy.\nThe city's economy is based on industry and watch manufacturers.\nWatch companies.\nMany watch companies started in La Chaux de Fonds:\nTwin Town.\nLa Chaux-de-Fonds is twinned with the town of Frameries, Belgium."}

This was a group of African-American students who became the first black students ever to attend classes at Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. They were able to attend the school after a court case, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The court ordered that schools had to integrate black and white students. Elizabeth's attempt to go to school was photographed on the morning of September 4, 1957. She was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Johnny Jenkins (UPI) showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day's startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the print press.\nThe most famous photo of the event was taken by Will Counts of the Arkansas Democrat. His photo was the unanimous selection for a 1958 Pulitzer Prize, but since the story had earned the Arkansas Gazette two other Pulitzer Prizes already, the Prize was awarded to another photographer for a pleasant photograph of a two-year-old boy in Washington, D.C. A different photo taken by Counts of Alex Wilson, a black reporter for the Memphis Tri-State Defender being beaten by the angry mob in Little Rock the same day, was chosen as the \"News Picture of the Year\" for 1957 by the National Press Photographers Association. This image by Counts prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to Little Rock."}

They were on the shores of Lake Como in northern Italy. Pliny had several villas on Lake Como. He wrote to his friend Voconius Romanus that the Comedy villa and the Tragedy villa were his two favorites. In Italy, the villas are called Villa Commedia and Villa Tragedia. In Italian, \"commedia\" means \"comedy\" and \"tragedia\" means \"tragedy\".\nIn his letter to Voconius Romanus Pliny also wrote that the Tragedy villa was on a hill above the lake but that the Comedy villa was right on the water's edge. Their names come from the theatre of ancient Greece and Rome. Pliny said that the villa on the hill was like the actors in tragedies who wore platform boots. He named that villa \"Tragedy\". The villa down by the water was like the actors in comedies who wore flat slippers. He named that villa \"Comedy\". Both villas were destroyed long ago. No one is sure exactly where they stood.\nMost people think that the Tragedy villa was in Bellagio, a small town on Lake Como. People are less sure where the Comedy villa was. The historian Paolo Giovio (1483-1552) thought that by the 16th century the Comedy villa was under the water of Lake Como near the village of Lenno. The geographer Abraham Ortelius (1527\u20131598) also wrote that the Comedy villa was in Lenno. But in 1876 a Roman mosaic floor and many Roman coins were found in Lierna, another small town on Lake Como. Many people there now think that the mosaic floor was part of the Comedy villa. In the early 20th century the French geographer \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus wrote that Lierna was the site of one of Pliny's villas, but he did not say which one.\nIn 1751 John Boyle, 5th Earl of Orrery, published his English translation of Pliny's letters. The letter to Voconius Romanus describing the Comedy and Tragedy villas was illustrated with an imaginary picture of the Comedy villa drawn by . The art historian Pierre de la Ruffini\u00e8re du Prey, has said that the villa in Wale's drawing looks like Alexander Pope's villa on the River Thames in London. Alexander Pope was a friend of John Boyle. Pliny's own description of the Comedy villa in his letter said that its terrace was gently curved like the shore of the lake. He could fish directly from his bedroom window. He said that lying in his bed at the Comedy villa was like lying in a fishing boat on the lake."}

The westernmost distributary of the delta is the Pathein (Bassein) River and the easternmost is the Yangon River. The land in the delta is low but it is not flat. The soil is made of fine silt.\nA large number of people live in the delta region. Because the soil can be as low as 3\u00a0metres above sea level, it is an important area for growing rice.\nOn 2 May 2008, Cyclone Nargis was a major disaster for the delta. The cyclone reportedly killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless.\nAnnual rainfall in the delta region is about 2,500\u00a0mm (100\u00a0in). Most of the rain falls during the monsoons which happen between May and November.\nEcology.\nThere is not a complete list of all the types of fish found along the Irrawaddy River. In 2008, it was estimated that the region is home to 119\u2013195 species of fish found nowhere else in the world.\nOne of the best-known species in the river is the Irrawaddy dolphin. The dolphin is listed as a vulnerable species, meaning it is at risk to become endangered. In 2016 officials report only 62 dolphins are left in Myanmar.\nThere are several different ecoregions along the river.\nNorthern Mountains.\nThe Irrawaddy River begins where the streams of the Nmai and Mali join.

She is known for creating a comic strip called \"Rhymes with Orange\" which is published digitally on her website and in over one hundred newspapers across the country. At the age of 25 she became the youngest cartoonist to ever be nationally syndicated. She won the Silver Reuben for \"Best Newspaper Panel Cartoon\" from the National Cartoonists Society four times, in 2007 and 2009, 2012 and 2014.\nEarly life.\nPrice grew up in Weston, Massachusetts. She studied English at Stanford University. She originally had no intentions of becoming a cartoonist, but after a few years she began submitting strips to The New Yorker but they were never picked up. She was then hired as a freelance copywriter for an ad agency in San Francisco. Whilst there she submitted her comics to the San Francisco Chronicle and they were published in the opinion and book review section. Her success at the Chronicle inspired her to begin submitting her work for syndication. In 1995, Price received a call from King Features Syndicate to request more samples of her work and by June of that year she was syndicated. Price was just 25 years old at the time which makes her the youngest cartoonist to achieve national syndication.\nCareer.\nPrice publishes her panels almost daily to her website named after her strip (\"Rhymes with Orange\"). The title is derived from the belief that no English word rhymes with orange.\nPrice's panels often feature animals such as cats and dogs in lieu of humans and doesn't feature any reoccurring characters.\nHer strips's format is also unique in design. A typical Price comic features one long panel where the illustration and dialogue are found, and to the left is a smaller panel with the title of the strip and often a secondary punchline and smaller illustration. This setup has the reader going from right to left rather than the typical left to right found in most western comics.\nIn addition to her website her work has also appeared in \"Parade Magazine\", \"The Funny Times\", \"People\" and \"Glamour\".\nPrice has released several compilations of her work in books, one of those being \"Hanukkomics\" in which she gathered all of her comics about Jewish culture and holidays.\nHer inspirations for comics include \"Dr. Seuss for the rhymes, Shel Silverstein for the clever word play and black-and-white illustrations, and \"The New Yorker\" cartoonists Roz Chast, Sam Gross and George Booth.\" But her main influence comes from greeting card artist Sandra Boynton. In the eighth grade, Price learned that Boynton, who she had assumed was a male, was in fact a female. This opened up the idea to Price that women could do \"funny drawings\" too.\nPersonal life.\nPrice is an openly gay, Jewish woman who lives in Florence, Massachusetts with her partner, dog, and cat. In her free time Price enjoys playing women's ice hockey."}

He was born in Torremaggiore, a town in Apulia. Later, he moved to Milan. In Milan he studied art at the Accademia di Brera. He had his first exhibition in 1969. His early paintings were in the expressionist style. His later paintings were more abstract. His 1981 painting \"The Death of the Bull\" is held in the Museo de Arte Moderno y Contempor\u00e1neo de Santander y Cantabria.\nUmberto Pettinicchio was trained at the Brera Academy and in 1969 he began to exhibit in his first solo exhibitions, including at the Nuova Sfera, Milan, 1973 (curated by Carlo Munari), in 1977 at the Rome Triptych, in 1974 at Il Castello di Milano, in 1975 (edited by Raffaele De Grada). In 1976 Pettinicchio opened his Milan studio in via Bolzano, where he produced some of his important works with which he achieved international fame.\nIn the 1980s, he was always present at the most important exhibitions (at the Salotto di Como in 1980, at Il Castello di Milano in 1981, at Il Mercante di Milano in 1982), and was also enriched by important Spanish exhibitions (Sargadelos, Barcelona, \u200b\u200b1982 , Piquio, Santander, 1982, at the VIII Madrid Biennial, 1983).\nStyle.\nThe artist Umberto Pettinicchio has often dealt with the human figure in his pictorial research, initially in an expressionist style. Subsequently, his pictorial style becomes more and more abstract until finally reaching the Informal. Only a vaguely perceptible appearance remains of the figure, while, from a formal point of view, everything is distorted in the artist's pictorial gestures. Pettinicchio's gesture breaks the dimensional planes and transforms the human figure into a shapeless matter marked by large black lines. The one carried out by Pettinicchio seems a kind of brutalist operation in the vein of a Jean Dubuffet, but while the French gave much more importance to the subject, our artist solves everything through pictorial writing."}

Ether is type of money which uses the Ethereum system to make sure that every person gets the right amount in every deal.\nEthereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Many people donated money to support the development of the system in what was one of the first initial coin offerings. The system came online on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins. \nIn 2016, Ethereum split into two separate versions: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. \nOverview.\n\"Ether\" is a type of money that is \"decentralized\", which means that there's no company, bank or government that oversees it. Instead, it uses the \"Ethereum\" network of computers spread around the world, which keep track of every payment of ether. As in other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum keeps track of payments by using a blockchain, which is a growing registry of every payment. This blockchain is open for everyone to read, and it is spread across the network so that everyone can check what payments have been made. This also protects against hacking or theft of money from the system, because if the blockchain was to be altered in some computers then it would be noticed that it is not identical with the others.\n\"Ether\" is a form of cryptocurrency, which means that it is \"decentralized\", and also means that people can use it for payments without revealing who they are. Instead, people can use the Ethereum system by \"addresses\" (also called \"keys\") which they can keep secret from others. The Ether coin can be transferred between accounts and used as a payment mechanism. The Ether coin is mined and used as compensation to miners for verifying transactions.\nHistory.\nEthereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of \"Bitcoin Magazine\" in late 2013. His goal was to build decentralized applications. \nEthereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014. During the conference, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Iorio (who financed the project) rented a house in Miami with Buterin to develop a fuller sense of what Ethereum might become. \nIn January 2018, Ethereum was the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin. As of 2021, it maintained that relative position. \nIn 2019, Ethereum Foundation employee Virgil Griffith was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea. \nOn 27 August 2021, the blockchain experienced a brief fork that was the result of clients running different incompatible software versions.

Dean, then Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2), recommended in his annual report to the Defense authority that a day be set aside by an act of the National Legislature to be styled and known as \u201cOld Soldier Army Festival\u201d a day on which units of the Liberian Armed Forces throughout the nation would assemble at their respective headquarters to jointly participate in field ceremonies of parades and other planned military exercises.\nColonel Dean\u2019s recommendation traveled through the necessary chain of command until it successfully reached the official desk of the late Commander-In-Chief, President William V.S. Tubman who, in turn, approved and submitted it to the lawmakers for legislative consideration.\nHow February 11 Was Chosen As Armed Forces Day\nWhen the Liberian legislature met in session to consider colonel Dean\u2019s recommendation for legislative enactment, it was suggested that choosing any month and date to be set aside as Army Festival would be inappropriate.\nInstead, a month and date with some historical events in which a member or members of the Armed Forces had performed some marvelous deeds in the supreme interest of the nation (Liberia) and its people.\nBy so doing, members of the incoming generations of the Armed Forces would continue to celebrate this day under appropriate military exercises in honor and remembrance of the heroic deeds of their comrades in arms. Moreover, this suggestion was embraced with popular support. However, the only event that could quickly come to the minds of the lawmakers was the month and date of the Major Mckay Cadell incidence in 1909.\nMajor Cadell was the first commandant of the Liberian Frontier Force who carried on mutiny action against the Liberian Government during President Arthur Barclay\u2019s administration, that aggression of Cadell was repelled by the first militia regiment headed by Ltc. Isaac Moart and his deputy Major.\nJoseph Dennis in 1909 having reached a unanimous consensus on the month and date of Major Cadell\u2019s event, of February 25 1955, an act of Legislature was passed, declaring May 9 of each year as Armed Forces Day with a proclamation that it should be officially observed throughout Liberia as a National holiday. When the Act was proclaimed on May 9 as the month and date of the Major Cadell\u2019s incidence, historians everywhere disagreed and argued that the incidence occurred on February 9, 1909. This argument in turn created a demand for legislative amendment.\nConsequently, on March 22, 1956, amendment was made, deleting May 9 and inserting February 9 in the Act as Armed Forces Day. Less than a year after the amendment was made, some survivors of the Major Cadell\u2019s incidence declared that it was February 11, 1909.\nOnce more and finally, on January 26, 1957, the appropriate rectification was made in the Act.

Their operation is based on \"locked\" randomness, stemming from tiny imperfections (mistakes) in the manufacturing process of hardware, which result in the production (output) of a bit-string which appears random and can be considered as unique per hardware instance (device).\nEssentially, in each PUF circuit, electric current may move through this circuit in two distinct ways/paths, such as two wires. If it goes mostly through one of these ways/paths, a logical zero is produced, whereas if it goes through the other way/path, a logical one is produced. The prevalent path is chosen according to tiny details (characteristics) of the circuit, such as which wire is thicker or longer. However, the two wires have been designed to be exactly the same, and only differ because of imperfections of the manufacturing process, which cause random tiny mistakes (imperfections), such as one wire being 5 mm, and the other 5.00001 mm. Therefore, and as the choice of the prevalent path is dependent on a large number of tiny details (thickness, length, resistance of the wires, etc.), which are very difficult to determine beforehand, this choice appears as random, and can be considered as chaotic. The tiny production mistakes that affect the path choice cannot be predicted as they happen randomly in the manufacturing process. Nevertheless, after they happen, they stay like that, for example, the small difference in length between two wires will always exist after they have been manufactured, so the aforementioned path choice is \"locked\", although it is \"random\" (chaotic), and will always give the same result.\nSince most contemporary hardware devices consist of millions of circuits, millions of individual choices can be made at the same time, resulting in a string (series) of bits (zeros and ones) of a very large length. Since each choice is independent and \"random\", the probability that two such strings will be the same becomes extremely small due to their very large length. Therefore, a PUF can be used to produce a large bit-string that will be \"unique\" per device and always the same, when measured under exactly the same conditions. Such a bit string can then be used in cryptography as an inherently occurring cryptographic token, such as a key for encryption. As external (environmental) conditions may affect the result of a PUF (its \"random\" unique bit-string output), error correction may be needed to force this result to be the same between different measurements.\nHardware, which by its nature allows for a choice of path for electricity, such as memory cells, can be easily employed in order to implement a PUF in a device, without the need of additional circuitry. Therefore, PUFs can be quite cost-efficient and lightweight."}

It was revealed on September 12, 2017, at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, at the same time as they released the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The iPhone X was released in several countries on November 3, 2017. This iPhone marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, with \"X\" representing the symbol \"ten\" in Roman numerals.\nHardware.\nThe iPhone X has an OLED display which measures 5.8 inches diagonally. Apple calls this a \"Super Retina Display\". It has a contrast ratio (the difference between the brightest a screen can be, and the darkest) of 1,000,000:1.\u00a0It is also very sharp, with a resolution of 2436-by-1125. It is also able to change its color temperature using True Tone. According to Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing, the screens Apple used in the iPhone X were made to avoid the \"oversaturation\" of colors that are displayed on most OLED panels by adjusting color so that it doesn't look too saturated or very intense.\nIt is available in two colors, Silver and Space Grey. It has a glass casing which Apple claims is \"the most durable ever in a smartphone\", and the entire body is made from stainless steel.\nInstead of Touch ID, a fingerprint scanner, it uses Face ID, which can recognize your face, even in total darkness or in direct sunlight. It can't be fooled by photos and simple masks, because unlike other solutions, it uses infrared cameras and dot projectors to scan your face, which Apple calls the \"TrueDepth camera system\". It can also scan through most eyeglasses and sunglasses, and it can still recognize you even if you change your hairstyle or grow a beard. You can use Face ID for unlocking your phone or for Apple Pay.\nThe iPhone X has two cameras on the back. The first one is a wide 12 MP camera. It can record video at 1080p HD or 4K and slow-mo at 720p or 1080p. The second camera is a zoom camera at also 12 MP. Using the second camera, you can zoom optically, so the picture does not lose quality. Together, the two cameras can be used for Portrait mode, which blurs the background and keeps the object or person in focus, and Portrait Lighting, which also does the same thing as Portrait Mode, but you can actually choose how the lighting looks.\nIn the front is a 7 MP camera. Using the TrueDepth cameras, it can also do Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting, but also Animojis, which are animated emojis that copy your facial expressions.\nThere is no home button on the iPhone X. The front and back are made of glass, and it allows for wireless charging with a Qi charger or with Apple's own wireless charging pad, AirPower.\nSoftware.\nBecause the screen, which is very different from iPhones before, apps needed to be updated so that it fills the entire screen. There are changes such as rounded corners, sensor \"notch\" at the top of the screen, and a sign for going to the home screen. Apple published a \"Human Interface Guidelines\" document for explaining and discouraged app makers from attempting to hide the changes.\nSince there is no home button, it uses swipes and gestures instead, like swiping up to go to the home screen."}

It is part of the North East MRT Line.\nHistory.\nWhen the North East Line opened, it was one of the 2 completed MRT stations of North East Line that was not open, the other being Woodleigh which opened on 20 June 2011. This station was originally planned to be opened with 15 other stations on the North East Line. However, a few days before the opening, the operator SBS Transit decided not to open the station as the area around the station was undeveloped and the company claimed that the number of passengers would be too low to cover operating costs.\nThe opening date of the station was 15 January 2006. The station was well maintained like any other station throughout the time before it was opened. To prepare for the station's opening, the programming had to be updated to include Buangkok. Residents had said they would be willing to walk 400 metres to the station every day.\nThe station opened on 15 January 2006. SBS Transit expected around 3,500 passengers to use the station daily, which would be the lowest among all the stations along the line, resulting in the station making a loss. However, the actual numbers was much lower than expected during its first week of operation. Only an average of 1,386 passengers used the station each day. For comparison, Clarke Quay station, which is the second most unused station, already had more than 6,000 passenger trips each day. However, Clarke Quay was located in the Central Business District with considerable development in the area. This was because the station was located over 400 metres from most residents' homes.\nFrom 5 January 2018, cash top ups are not accepted at the passenger service centres at this station.\nArt in Transit.\nThere is an artwork in the station. It was made by Vincent Leow. It is called \"Water, Nature and the Contemporary\" (current)."}

Paul Getty refused to cooperate with the group of kidnappers, from the organized crime Mafia group 'Ndrangheta, who kidnapped his grandson John Paul Getty III in the 1970s.\nKevin Spacey originally portrayed Getty Sr. However, after multiple sexual assault allegations were revealed against Spacey, his scenes were cut and re-shot with Christopher Plummer. Though re-shoots began on November 20, 2017, TriStar Pictures has the movie's United States release scheduled for December 22, 2017, but moved the date to December 25.\nFor their roles, Williams and Plummer are nominated for a Golden Globe Award with Plummer being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor."}

It is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology.\nReinforcement learning is different from supervised learning because the correct inputs and outputs are never shown. Also, reinforcement learning usually learns as it goes (online learning) unlike supervised learning. This means an agent has to choose between exploring and sticking with what it knows best.\nIntroduction.\nA reinforcement learning system is made of a \"policy\" (formula_1), a \"reward function\" (formula_2), a \"value function\" (formula_3), and an optional \"model\" of the environment.\nA \"policy\" tells the agent what to do in a certain situation. It can be a simple table of rules, or a complicated search for the correct action. Policies can even be stochastic, which means instead of rules the policy assigns \"probabilities\" to each action. A policy by itself can make an agent do things, but it can't learn on its own.\nA \"reward function\" defines the goal for an agent. It takes in a state (or a state and the action taken at that state) and gives back a number called the \"reward\", which tells the agent how good it is to be in that state. The agent's job is to get the biggest amount of reward it possibly can in the long run. If an action yields a low reward, the agent will probably take a better action in the future. Biology uses reward signals like pleasure or pain to make sure organisms stay alive to reproduce. Reward signals can also be stochastic, like a slot machine at a casino, where sometimes they pay and sometimes they don't.\nA \"value function\" tells an agent how much reward it will get following a policy formula_1 starting from state formula_5. It represents how \"desirable\" it is to be in a certain state. Since the value function isn't given to the agent directly, it needs to come up with a good guess or estimate based on the reward it's gotten so far. Value function estimation is the most important part of most reinforcement learning algorithms.\nA \"model\" is the agent's mental copy of the environment. It's used to \"plan\" future actions.\nKnowing this, we can talk about the main loop for a reinforcement learning episode. The agent interacts with the environment in \"discrete time steps\". Think of it like the \"tick-tock\" of a clock. With discrete time, things only happen during the \"ticks\" and the \"tocks\", and not in between. At each time formula_6, the agent observes the environment's state formula_7 and picks an action formula_8 based on a policy formula_1. The next time step, the agent receives a reward signal formula_10 and a new observation formula_11. The value function formula_12 is updated using the reward. This continues until a terminal state formula_13 is reached."}

He is famous for being in the highest court in Britain. He judged a lot of legal trials involving boats and the British Navy, he most helped lawyers by writing a book about American law.\nLife.\nJames Marriott was born on 29 October 1730. In June 1746 he was sent to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and graduated in 1751. Although he had wanted a job in the church, he decided to switch to law in 1755, maybe because his stepfather, a very good lawyer, told him to. He spent three years as librarian to the Duke of Newcastle. He joined the College of Advocates and began his legal job in which he wrote two books on law.\nWhile he served the Duke of Newcastle, he began to flatter others with nice words, which gave him the job of Receiver of Land Tax for Suffolk, but did not do much else until King George III was made king in 1760, when he left Newcastle for the new king. In 1767 he was made king's advocate, mostly because there was no one else to do it. In 1767 he served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge for a year and in 1768.\nFor the next ten years he kept trying to get a better job, making Lord Grafton very angry in the process.In 1778 he was knighted and made the Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, responsible for cases involving boats and the Navy. His work as king's advocate was not impressive, because of his lack of good choice-making and bad courtroom behaviors, as well as his aggressive speeches against his own co-workers. In 1781 he was elected to Parliament for Sudbury. Marriott worked for Lord Shelburne, who strongly opposed war.\nThe French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 caused the Navy to be used more and more, which made Marriott judge on more cases than he normally would, even though he was able to make some important decisions. He was also re-elected for his Parliament job in 1796. he had supported someone else, but then changed his mind and ran for election himself. Marriott remained in Parliament until 1802, shortly before he died.\nMarriott quit his job in 1798. He returned to Twinstead Hall and stayed there until he died on 21 March 1803, having rebuilt the local church. The year before he died he wrote his most important book, \"Formulare instrumentarum\", a book about his job with Naval law that caused Naval law in the United States to change. He also made a lot of poems and legal books that were not important. He never married, his one try in 1760 causing both the girl and her father to say \"no.\" Instead he took care of his mother until her death."}

They are sometimes called vault lights or sidewalk prisms. They were much used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when electric lighting was very expensive. Some cities are removing these lights, but others are keeping and restoring them.\nUses.\nPavement lights give sunlight into the basements below it during the day, and the basement gives light to the sidewalk from below during the night. These lights are meant to make basements more useful in cities and places where space is scarce. In places with high rent, these lights may make an area look better, which helps landlords make more money. People with these lights can also save on electricity during the day, because the lights are clear like a window, where sunlight can go through.\nMany years ago, pavement lights were advertised as a way of saving on electricity costs and making places look better. Today's science has proven that they were right.\nPavement lights are also used in floors with glass roofs. They could be put in a floor below another floor with more pavement lights, letting sunlight go through more than one floor. Manhole covers were also made with pavement lights.\nMost old cities have pavement lights, or at least, they have had them in the past. These lights are about 100 years old.

The Pari (or Peri) in Persian mythology are described to be a race of beautiful and benevolent supernatural fairy beings, earlier regarded as malevolent. Risa (given name) can be used as a nickname also."}

It is closely related to the marsupial lion, \"Thylacoleo carnifex\", which lived until 30,000 years ago. \"Wakaleo schouteni\" is estimated to have become extinct about 19 million years ago.. It was the size of a small dog, and would have weighed about 23 kg. Scientists have estimated it is one of the oldest known members of the marsupial lion family.\nThe small marsupial lion has been named after wildlife artist, Peter Schouten. He has worked with paleontologists from the University of New South Wales, studying the fossils at the Riversleigh site in Queensland. They found the fossilized skull, teeth and humerus bone of the marsupial lion. At the time it lived the area would have been rainforest and it would have eaten small birds, possums and lizards."}

It is used as a surname or prefix to identify patriarchal lineage. \nIt is derived from a historical Title role of Persian origin (M\u012brz\u0101), denoting the rank of a royal prince , high nobleman , or a military commander equivalent to a nobleman. It is usually defined in English as Prince of the blood.\nSpecifically, it was used as a title by and today signifies patriarchal lineage to the various Persian Empire , Turkish Ottoman Empire , the Shirvanshahs and Circassians of the Caucasus, Mughals / Moguls or Muslim Rajputs of the Indian Subcontinent.[2] It was also a title bestowed upon members of the highest aristocracies in Tatar states, such as the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan.\nEtymology.\nThe word M\u012brz\u0101 is derived from the Persian term \u2018Am\u012brz\u0101de which literally means \"child of the \u2018Am\u012br\" or \"child of the ruler\".[3] \u2018Am\u012brz\u0101d in turn consists of the Arabic title \u2018Am\u012br (english: Emir), meaning \"commander\" and \"Prince\", and the Persian suffix -z\u0101d, meaning \"birth\" or \"lineage\". Due to vowel harmony in Turkic languages, the alternative pronunciation Mortar (weapon) (plural morzalar; derived from the Persian word) is also used. The word Mirza means royalty in almost every old version of Persian, Arab, Caucasian, Turkish and Indian languages.\nVariant spellings in English include mirzya, miriza, mirize, mirze, morsey, mursay, murse, meirsa, mirzey, mursi, murze, murza, mirza, myrza, meerza .\nRoyal title.\nThe titles themselves were given by the King, Sultan and Emperor (equivalent to the western Fount of honour) to their sons and grandsons, or even distant kins. Noblemen loyal to the kings also received this Title.\nThe title itself is derived from the title Emir. Emir, meaning \"commander\" or \"Prince\", is derived from the Semitic root \"Amr\", meaning \"command\". Originally it simply meant \"commander\" or \"leader\", usually in reference to a group of people. It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word \"Prince.\" The word entered English in 1595, from the French \u00e9mir"}

However, there are also many different looks, such as sports or technology. They can either be made of paper, wood or fabric.\nMany Advent calendars and large cards shaped like a rectangle, with little \"windows\" that can be opened. There are usually 24 windows on a card, one for each day from December 1 to the day before Christmas. Each window has a number, and you open one each day. For example, on December 16, you would open the window with a '16' on it. There are sometimes pictures, poems, or even chocolate behind each window. Other calendars have Bible verses or a prayer behind the windows, which Christians use to celebrate their Advent as part of their religion. Advent calendars can also have puzzles or games behind the windows.\nThere are many different kinds of Advent calendars.
