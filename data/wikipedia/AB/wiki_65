Negative side effects include fatigue, nausea, dizziness, hair loss and dry skin. These effects are said to disappear when the person starts eating.\nClear liquid diet.\nA clear liquid diet is made up of a diet only contains transparent liquid foods that do not contain any solid particles. It is sometimes called a \"surgical liquid diet\" because of its perioperative uses.

It is one of the communities in Bende Local Government Area in Abia State, Nigeria. It is next to Akeze (in Ebony State) in the north, Nkporo in the east, Alayi in the west, and Abiriba and Igbere in the south.\nThe Okpi Stool.\nThe Okpi Stool is an ancient, sacred, foremost or highest traditional institution in Item. The Okpi is the father of Item people. The Okpi is the Paramount Ruler of Item and Clan Head of Item. The Okpi Stool is non-religious and non-political; rather he is the father of all religious and political bodies. Okpi of Item is the head of the executive, legislature and judiciary in Item traditional system of government.\nItem traditional system of government.\nBefore the beginning of colonial government, Item people had a stable traditional government. Okpi was and still is the father of Item and the pinnacle of the whole genealogy. In Item generally as in most neighbouring communities like Abam, Abiriba and Ututu, the Otosi or Ofo Eze is the system of supreme authority of rulership.\nIt would be extremely difficult to describe or explain the influence and importance of the Otosi in the life of Item people. All authorities in the community derive legitimacy from the Otosi or Ofo Eze, hence traditional rulership in Item is hereditary.\nThe kindred\u2019s with royal and priestly responsibilities are those that brought Otosi to Item from Potopo. The Otosi or Ofo Eze remains the most important symbol of authority in Item.\nThe Otosi or Ofo Eze is a very powerful swagger always left in the authority of traditional Ruling and Royal Kindreds. The Otosi was and remains a source of strength succour, bond of unity, as well as political and religious union, hence you hear the slogan \u201cITEM BU ULORANI\u201d [Item is one house]. Little wonder, all important cultural festivals in Item, such as Igwa Nmam, Ita Achicha, Iwa Ama and Iri Ndi are celebrated on same day in Item Clan.\nThe following are the ancestral royal and ruling kindred in Item: Ndi Okorocha Apuanu Item, Umuafiaji Okoko Item, Ekwo Amaokwe Item and Umuovum Ameke Item. In the olden days, these four royal kindred constitute the Abu Ano Item\u00a0 Item King Makers and their heads were the heads of the four original villages in Item.\nThey were assisting the Okpi of Item, who doubled as the chairman of Obu Ano Item in performing the executive, legislative and judicial functions. In these four villages, they are second in command to the traditional village heads, otherwise known as \u201cAGBA EZE\u201d in Apuanu Item, the Agba Eze is Ndu Ihize, in Okoko Item- Umuogbe Okoko Item in Amaokwe Item\u00a0 Amafor Amaokwe Item, in Ameke Item Ndi Elekwa/Ugwuapu/Amaoba.\nAs farmsteads expanded and increased both in population and socio-economic activities, they were given village status. They include Okagwe, Umuakpa, Akanu, Okai and Amaekpu Item. In other to have efficient and effective government in Item, the heads of the five new villages were admitted into the Council of Chief and Elders, still under the chairmanship of Okpi of Item no matter the venue of their meeting.\nThey perform the executive functions in their various villages but were not vested with the sceptre of Otosi or Ofo Eze. Nonetheless, it must be noted that in these five villages only the kith and kin of heads and second in command were the heads, hence it is convenient and appropriate to incorporate them into the supreme council of Obu Ano Item\u00a0 Item King-Makers.\nNo wonder, the colonial government after a careful study opined that Item had a stable traditional government similar to the system in England and congratulated as well as encouraged Item people on their orderly system of government.\nMethod of selection and installation of Okpi of Item.\nWhenever there is a vacancy usually by the demise of the ruling Okpi, the Stool of Okpi Item devolves on the next senior man in Ndi Okorocha Royal Kindred, except where he objects to taking the office for a reason. Immediately after the death of the ruling Okpi and before new one takes office, the son of the deceased Okpi or a minor a regent from his family is appointed by the king-makers to act as Okpi, until the new Okpi is selected and installed in accordance with age-long tradition of Item."}

{"id": "823668", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=823668", "title": "Java Mousedeer", "text": "The Java mouse-deer (\"Tragulus javanicus\") is a leaf-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous ungulate in the family Tragulidae. When it reaches maturity it is about the size of a rabbit, making it the smallest living ungulate. It is found in forests in Java and perhaps Bali, although sightings there have not been verified.\nTaxonomy.\nThe Java mouse-deer's common scientific name is \"Tragulus javanicus\", although other classification names for it exist, including \"Tragulus javanica\", \"Cervus javanicus\", and the heterotypic synonym \"Tragulus fuscatus\". The Java mouse-deer is also known by many common names, including Javan chevrotain, Javan mousdeer, or Java Mousedeer. The taxonomic status of the Java mouse-deer is questionable, but recent craniometric analyses have begun to shed light on the taxonomic discrepancies. Previously, the Java mouse-deer, \"Tragulus javanicus\", was commonly thought to represent the wider class of large chevrotains, but it was found that these, unlike the Java mouse-deer, do not likely reside on Java. Three species groups of \"Tragulus\" have been identified based on craniometric skull analyses and coat coloration patterns. These three species groups are \"Tragulus javanicus\", \"Tragulus napu\", and \"Tragulus versicolor\". Based upon these craniometric analyses, \"Tragulus javanicus\" was then further separated based on the organisms\u2019 known geographic locations: \"Tragulus williamsoni\" (found in northern Thailand and possibly southern China), \"Tragulus kanchil\" (found in Borneo, Sumatra, the Thai\u2013Malay Peninsula, islands within the Greater Sunda region, and continental Southeast Asia), and \"Tragulus javanicus\" (found in Java). Thus, because of its uniqueness to the island of Java, the Java mouse-deer is now considered a distinct species, although this fact has not significantly affected its current classification.\nAppearance and biology.\nMouse-deer possess a triangular-shaped head, arched back, and round body with elevated rear quarters. The thin, short legs which support the mouse-deer are about the diameter of an average pencil. Although Java mouse-deer do not possess antlers or horns like regular deer, male Java mouse-deer have elongated, tusk-like upper canines which protrude downward from the upper jaw along the sides of their mouth. Males use these \u201ctusks\u201d to defend themselves and their mates against rivals. Females can be distinguished from males because they lack these prominent canines, and they are slightly smaller than the males. Java mouse-deer can furthermore be distinguished by their lack of upper incisors. The coat coloration of the Java mouse-deer is reddish-brown with a white underside. Pale white spots or vertical markings are also present on the animal's neck.\nWith an average length of and an average height of , the Java mouse-deer is the smallest extant (living) ungulate or hoofed mammal, as well as the smallest extant even-toed ungulate. The weight of the Java mouse-deer ranges from , with males being heavier than females. It has an average tail length of about . Mouse-deer are thought to be the most primitive ruminants based on their behaviour and the fossil record, thus they are the living link between ruminants and non-ruminants.\nThe Java mouse-deer is endothermic and homoeothermic, and has an average basal metabolic rate of about 4.883 watts. It also has the smallest red blood cells (erythrocytes) of any mammal, and about 12.8% of the cells have pits on them. The pits range in diameter from 68 to 390 nanometres. Red blood cells with pits are unique and have not been reported before either physiologically or pathologically.\nEcology.\nGeographic range.\n\"Tragulus javanicus\" is usually considered to be endemic to Java, Indonesia. There have been unverified reports of sightings on Bali.\nHabitat.\nThe Java mouse-deer prefers habitats of higher elevations and the tropical forest regions of Java, although it does appear at lower elevations between above sea level. During the day, Java mouse-deer can be seen roaming in crown-gap areas with dense undergrowth of creeping bamboo, through which they make tunnels through the thick vegetation which lead to resting places and feeding areas. At night, the Java mouse-deer moves to higher and drier ridge areas. It has been argued that Java mouse-deer are an \u201cedge\u201d species, favoring areas of dense vegetation along riverbanks. Additionally, Java mouse-deer have been found to be more prevalent in logged areas than in the more mature forests, and their densities tended to decrease proportionately as the logged forests matured.\nBehavior.\nDiet.\nJava mouse-deer are primarily herbivores, although in captivity they have been observed to eat insects as well as foliage. Their diet consists primarily of that which they find on the ground in the dense vegetation they inhabit, and they prefer the plants of the faster-growing gap species over the closed forest understory species, likely due to the increased richness of secondary protective compounds which the gap species provide. They are often classified as folivores, eating primarily leaves, shrubs, shoots, buds, and fungi, in addition to fruits which have fallen from trees. The fruits which Java mouse-deer commonly consume range from , while the seeds range from .\nSocial behavior.\nGroups of Java mouse-deer are commonly referred to as \u201cherds,\u201d while females are termed \u201cdoes,\u201d \u201chinds,\u201d or \u201ccows.\u201d Males are referred to as either \u201cbucks,\u201d \u201cstags,\u201d or \u201cbulls,\u201d and their young are commonly called \u201cfawns,\u201d or \u201casses\u201d. \nIt was previously believed that Java mouse-deer were nocturnal, but more recent studies have shown that they are neither truly nocturnal nor diurnal, but instead crepuscular, meaning they prefer to be active during the dim light of dawn and dusk. This behavior has been observed in both wild and captive Java mouse-deer. Although Java mouse-deer form monogamous family groups, they are usually shy, solitary animals. They are also usually silent; the only noise they make is a shrill cry when they are frightened. \nMale Java mouse-deer are territorial, marking their territory and their mates with secretions from an intermandibular scent gland under their chin. This territorial marking usually includes urinating or defecating to mark their area. To protect themselves and their mates or to defend their territory, mouse-deer slash rivals with their sharp, protruding canine \u201ctusks.\u201d It has also been observed that, when threatened, the Java mouse-deer will beat its hooves quickly against the ground, reaching speeds of up to 7 beats per second, creating a \u201cdrum roll\u201d sound. \nThe territories of \"Tragulus javanicus\" males and females have been observed to overlap considerably, yet individuals of the same sex do not share their territories. When giving birth, however, females tend to establish a new home range. Female Java mouse-deer have an estimated home range of , while males inhabit, on average, . Additionally, male Java mouse-deer, in nature, were observed to travel distances of daily on average, while females average daily.\nReproduction.\nJava mouse-deer are capable of breeding at any time during the year, and this has been observed during captivity. However, some sources have observed that the breeding season for the Java mouse-deer in nature occurs from November to December. Additionally, female mouse-deer have the potential to be pregnant throughout most of their adult life, and they are capable of conceiving 85\u2013155 minutes after giving birth. The Java mouse-deer's gestation period usually lasts 4.5 months, or 144 days. Typical litters consist of a single fawn, which resembles a miniature adult, although the tusk-like incisors prevalent in males are not visible in the young mouse-deer. The average mass of a newborn fawn is , and these precocial young are capable of standing within 30 minutes after birth. Fawns are capable of eating solid food within two weeks, yet it takes around 12 weeks to completely wean the fawns. On average, it takes the young, both male and female, 167 days (~5 months) to reach sexual maturity. Mouse-deer have been observed to live up to 14 years in captivity, but their lifespan in nature is still an open question.\nPredators.\nOne of the main predators which the Java mouse-deer face is humans. Through the destruction of their habitat, as well as from hunting and trapping the mouse-deer for food, their pelts, and for pets, humans have considerably reduced the Java mouse-deer population. Mouse-deer are particularly vulnerable to being hunted by humans at night because of their tendency to freeze when illuminated by having a spotlight shone on them. Because of the small size of the Java mouse-deer, dogs are also a common predator for them, as well as crocodiles, big cats, birds of prey, and snakes.\nDiseases.\nAlthough research into the diseases and parasites which affect the Java mouse-deer are still nascent, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV 1), a pestivirus of the family flaviviridae has been detected in Java mouse-deer. Mouse-deer acquire this virus through fetal infection during early pregnancy. Once acquired, individuals with BVDV can gain lifelong immune tolerance.\nConservation status.\nJava mouse-deer is currently categorized as \u201cData Deficient\u201d on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. This data deficiency is due to the inconclusiveness regarding the distinct separation of \"Tragulus\" species, in addition to the lack of information on \"Tragulus javanicus\". Even comparison of past observed numbers of Java mouse-deer with those presently observed does not greatly aid researchers because of the high likelihood of inaccuracy in past observations. Although listed as \u201cData Deficient,\u201d it is highly probable that a decline in the numbers of Java mouse-deer is occurring, and upon further investigation of this issue, the Red List status of \"Tragulus javanicus\" could easily change to \u201cVulnerable\u201d. Some conservation actions which have been implemented include legally protecting the species, which, although it has been in effect since 1931, makes no significant difference since hunting of Java mouse-deer still occurs. Additionally, some areas of Java which the Java mouse-deer frequents have been protected, yet enforcement of these regulations is still needed. One of the greatest conservation efforts needed is simply more information about the species: a more complete definition of its taxonomy, as well as more information on its habitat and behavior.\nIndonesian folklore.\nHistorically, the mouse-deer has featured prominently in Malay and Indonesian folklore, where it is considered a wise creature. This character, Sang Kancil (pronounced \u201cKahn-cheel\u201d), is a diminutive but wise mouse-deer. Sang Kancil is a tiny and cunning hero who, through his intelligence, is able to prevail over his larger tyrants and foes."}

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on February 7, 1997. The episode is about the Simpson family getting a nanny named Shary Bobbins (a parody of Mary Poppins). \nThe episode was written by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. Chuck Sheetz is the director of the episode. It got a Nielsen rating of 8.8. This means that about 8.5 million people saw the episode when it was first broadcast. In 2014, Jean put the episode in his list of the 5 most important episodes of \"The Simpsons\".\nStory.\nMarge Simpson starts to lose some of her hair very quickly. Dr. Hibbert says that she is losing hair because of her stress. The Simpson family wants to hire a nanny to care for their children and help with their house. They have trouble finding a good nanny. A woman with an umbrella comes from the sky on to the ground. The woman is Sharry Bobbins and makes herself known to the family. They think there are no problems with her and hire her. \nShary helps with work around the house. Marge's hair starts to come back. At dinner, Shary says that she does not need to help around with the family anymore. When she leaves the house, she sees Homer strangling Bart, Maggie stopping a fire, and Marge losing hair again. Shary must stay to help with the family again.\nThe family starts to act rude to Shary and does not care for her excitement. Shary starts to feel depressed and cries. Marge says that Shary can not be able to change how the family acts. The family says in a song that they are happy with how they act. Shary thinks that the family is okay and leaves with her umbrella. She is killed when she flies into a jet engine of an airplane. \nProduction.\nAl Jean and Mike Reiss made a deal with Disney to make four episodes of \"The Simpsons\". Jean and Reiss thought of the episode's story years before it was made. They talked about the idea with other writers but no one wanted to make an episode with the story. When they were able to make episodes again, they wrote the dialogue of the episode. Reiss first did not like the episode. He thought that the story was foolish and had too much magic in it. He now thinks that it is one of the best episodes he wrote. When it was made, the episode had more music than any other episode. Jean thought that the songs would make the episode as long as it needed to be. However, it was still shorter than regular episodes. Many parts of the episode were added to make it longer. For example, an \"Itchy &amp; Scratchy\" cartoon was put in the episode. There was going to be a song where Bart, Lisa and Shary go to Patty and Selma and sing about smoking. The song was not put in the episode because producers did not think it was funny. The song was put in the album \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons\". Some animation of the song was shown in the 8th season's DVD as a deleted scene. Eric Stefani made the animation for some of the episode's songs.\nJulie Andrews was first going to be the voice actor of Shary. Maggie Roswell was made the voice actor after producers heard her speak some of the episode's dialogue. Producers wanted Quentin Tarantino to be the voice actor for a character in the \"Itchy &amp; Scratchy\" cartoon. He did not want to because he thought the dialogue was rude. Dan Castellaneta was the voice actor for that character in the episode."}

Scientists have seen it as high as 1600 meters above sea level.\nThe adult male frog is 2.4 to 2.7 cm long and the largest adult female frogs are 3.7 cm long. Frogs that live high up in the hills are larger than frogs that live low and close to the ocean. This frog's head is wider than its body. It has yellow skin and a brown pattern on its back that look like an hourglass. \nMale frogs sing for females after it rains. The rain creates pools of water that are not there during the dry season. The males sit on plants high above the pools and sing so the females will come to them. There are also \"sneaker males\" who sit between the pools and the singing males so the females will meet them first.\nThe females lay 180 to 300 eggs at a time. Most frogs can lay eggs either on land or in water but not both. However, the hourglass tree frog can lay eggs on both. If the pool is in the sun, the female frog will lay her eggs on a piece of plant under the surface of the water so that they don't dry out. If the pool is in the shade, she will lay her eggs near the water so that the tadpoles fall into it after they hatch. For example, she may lay her eggs on a leaf on a branch hanging over the water. If she lays eggs in the water, fish might eat them. If she lays eggs on a leaf, wasps, ants or spiders might eat them.\nThe tadpoles can be 6.72 to 7.47 mm long when they first hatch and they can grow to 2.9 cm. They eat algae and hide in underwater plants.\nThe nematode worm parasite \"Cosmocerca parva\" can infect this frog.\nThis frog does not get very sick from the chytridiomycosis fungal disease the way many other frogs do. Scientists found that the microbiota of hourglass tree frogs, which is all the bacteria and other microorganisms that live on and in the frog's body, is different from the microbiota of other frogs. Scientists think this might protect the hourglass tree frog from chytridiomycosis but they are not sure.\nScientists and students use the hourglass tree frog as a test animal because it is not endangered and because it can lay eggs on land or in water. Humans also keep these frogs as pets."}

This accidentally starts a fire and burns Jerome's house. Jerome goes to Lois and says that he will hurt the guy who burned his house. He does not know that Peter did it. Lois lets Jerome stay in their house. Peter starts to act very jealous. He dresses as a ghost that makes him look like a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This was to make Jerome leave their house.

Ahsan Haque from IGN did not like how the episode was made. Haque thought that the episode's story sounded better as an idea. Ramsey Isler (another IGN reviewer) said that the episode was not funny and the writing was lazy and not original."}

The show follows Florence on her adventures with her other workers, Lyle Block, her annoying manager; Elena Beltran, her helper; Earl Bellamy, the house detective who cannot do his job; Hank Sabatino, the crazy handyman; Betty, the floor supervisor; Dennis, the bellboy; and Mr. Claymore, the hotel owner. \nReception.\n\"Checking In\" was first on CBS on April 9, 1981, and lasted for only four episodes in the Thursday, 8:00\u00a0p.m. EST time. The show had low ratings, and was cancelled, with the final episode airing on April 30, 1981. Gibbs then returned to her regular role on \"The Jeffersons\" and it was said that the St. Frederick Hotel had burned down.\n\"Checking In\" was the first \"All in the Family\" spin-off show that did not do good, which was different from \"The Jeffersons\", \"Maude\" and Maude spin-off \"Good Times\". More tries to do spin-offs after \"Checking In\" were also not good like (\"Gloria\" in the 1982-1983 season and \"704 Hauser\" in 1994)."}

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on November 24, 2002. The episode is about Marge Simpson accidentally getting breast implants. \nAbout 17.4 million people watched the episode when it was first broadcast. The episode was put on a DVD of episodes about romance. The DVD also has the episodes \"Natural Born Kissers\", \"Three Gays of the Condo\", and \"The Way We Weren't\".\nStory.\nHomer and Lisa try building houses for Habitat for Humanity. Two women there think that Homer is a bachelor. Marge drives by Homer and thinks that he is flirting with the two women. She thinks that getting a liposuction will make Homer like her more. However, she is accidentally given breast implants. A doctor says that she has to wait 48 hours to get them off.\nBart and Milhouse watch \"Batman\" with Krusty the Clown as a villain. Krusty puts Batman and Robin on a carousel and makes it go dangerously fast. Bart wants to try it on Milhouse. He puts Milhouse on the carousel at their school. Otto Mann makes the carousel go very fast. The carousel starts to fly and makes the school's flag of the United States fall. Milhouse gets dizzy and vomits on the flag. Bart and Milhouse get in trouble and say that Krusty made them do it. Krusty gets in trouble and has to make his television show safer for children.\nMarge's breast implants makes it more difficult to work. She tries to hide them from her family, but they all see it later. They go to a restaurant and are given better quality food than other people. A person doing trade fairs sees Marge and gives her a job as a model. Marge likes being a model at first, but she starts getting sexually harassed. At an expo, Marge gets sexually harassed while trying to promote shoehorns. Krusty, Bart, and Milhouse go to the expo with an elephant. They make a plan that Krusty will save Milhouse from being hurt by the elephant. However, the elephant tries to eat Bart, Milhouse, and Homer. Chief Wiggum wants to shoot the elephant's mouth. Marge stop him from shooting by showing everyone her breasts. Krusty remembers and says the word used to stop the elephant. Krusty saves Bart and Milhouse and is popular again. Marge later gets her breast implants taken out. \nProduction.\n\"Large Marge\" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham. Jim Reardon is the director of the episode. Adam West and Burt Ward are voice actors for the television show \"Batman\". They are guest stars in the episode as the characters they voice act in the show. Baha Men made a parody of their song \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\" for the episode.\nReception.\nJeff Otto from IGN said that the episode is good, but not as good as other episodes about romance. Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide thought that the episode's story is high concept (art that can be easily made), but that it \"works pretty well\". He liked how Marge's breast implants make the episode humorous. He said the other story with Bart and Krusty makes both stories a \"fun manner\". Victor Valdivia from DVD Verdict thought that this episode and \"The Strong Arms of the Ma\" show that Marge as a character makes it not as good as other episodes of the show."}

As a result, many scriptures and ideas are present both in Judaism and Christianity. Since about the 19th century, the term Judeo-Christian is used, to either describe this common heritage, or to show how Christianity developed from Judaism. The term \"Abrahamic religions\" also includes other religions, for which Abraham was an important person, most notably Islam. \nAt the time of Christ, Judaism was legal within the Roman Empire, and Jews were permitted to worship their religion. Christians were not covered by this arrangement, yet they had in the first century A.D. no Bible: the first book of the New Testament was not written until about 100 AD, though even that date this is not precisely known. It is deduced from its internal content. The other books were written even later. That is why in modern Bibles over half the content is from the Jewish tradition.\nFor this reason the phrase \"Judeo-Christian\" says just that Christianity rose from Judaism, and much of its Bible consists of incidents taken from Jewish mythology or history as represented in the Torah."}

During that time, the forces that had been active before the French Revolution rose to power again. Politically, the times were very hard, and there was a lot of repression. For this reason, most of the arts focused on apolitical life at home. \nIn painting, \"Biedermeier\" focused on landscapes, portraits, and perhaps still lifes, or genre paintings. There are almost no religious or historical paintings. Many painters wanted to copy or to resemble 17th century Dutch painters. Many paintings were realist, almost like a modern-day photograph. Interior portraits were typical for Biedermeier: there the idea was to show a fully furnished room, in all its details.\nIn music, there's no epoch called \"Biedermeier\": the only thing that is perhaps worth mentioning that playing music at home, in the family became important, this is known as house concert.\nIn theatre, the main focus was entertainment, not like the Age of Enlightenment. Also in addition to the national theatres, a number of smaller theatres started to exist. "}

The dialects of the Upper Palatinate and the Bavarian Forest are also called \u201c\"Waidlerische\"\u201d. Linguistically, these are North Bavarian, North Central Bavarian and Central Bavarian dialects, with the North Bavarian elements gradually increasing towards the north. \nSpoken regions.\nNorthern Bavarian is spoken in most of the Upper Palatinate, in the southeastern parts of Upper Franconia and Middle Franconia, in the northernmost part of Upper Bavaria and in the southernmost part of Saxony (Southern Vogtland). In the south-eastern Upper Palatinate and in the northernmost part of Lower Bavaria, mixed forms of Northern and Central Bavarian - linguistically called Northern Central Bavarian - are spoken, with the city of Regensburg being a Central Bavarian linguistic island within this area."}

The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee.

During the season the names Leepi and Mangkhut were used for the first time, after they had replaced the names Xangsane and Durian, which were retired after the 2006 season.\nAfter the season the Typhoon Committee retired the names \"Sonamu\", \"Utor\", \"Fitow\" and \"Haiyan\" from its naming lists, and in February 2015, the names were subsequently replaced with \"Jongdari\", \"Barijat\", \"Mun\" and \"Bailu\" for future seasons.\nPhilippines.\nDuring the season PAGASA used its own naming scheme for the 25 tropical cyclones, that either developed within or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility. The names were taken from a list of names, that had been last used during 2009 and was used again during 2017. The names Fabian, Odette and Paolo were used for the first time during the year after the names Ondoy, and Pepeng were retired. The names Wilma, Yolanda, and Zoraida were also used for the first time (and only in the case of Yolanda).\nAfter the season the names Labuyo, Santi and Yolanda were retired by PAGASA, as they had caused over 300 deaths and over PhP1 billion in damages.

The wars gave Rome rich farmlands in Gaul (roughly France and Belgium up to the Rhine).\nCaesar's sub-commanders included Mark Antony, Titus Labienus, Quintus Tullius Cicero (brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero), Publius Licinius Crassus (brother of Marcus Licinus Crassus, the richest man in Rome), Decimus Brutus Albinus and Servius Sulpicius Galba.\nJulius Caesar described the Gallic Wars in his book \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\". This is the main source, but it makes impossible claims about the number of Gauls killed (over a million), while claiming few Roman casualties. Modern historians believe that Gallic forces were far smaller than Caesar claimed, and that they (the Romans) suffered tens of thousands of casualties. One of the leaders of the Gauls, Vercingetorix, was taken to Rome, and later executed.\nThe main contemporary source for the conflict is Julius Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\". This was thought to be truthful and accurate until the 20th century. Even in 1908, Camille Jullian wrote a comprehensive history of Gaul and took Caesar's account as absolutely true. But after World War\u00a0II, historians began to question if Caesar's claims stood up.\nModern estimates are that at the battle of Alesia, in 52 BC, there were about 70.000 Gauls, and the same number of Roman troops."}

He later teaches Meg how to use it. Joe impounds the tank when he gets hurt by it. Meg gets a job at a superstore so that she can get the money to buy her own car. The superstore makes other shops in the town go bankrupt. \nPeter loses his job at a brewery because the superstore makes better beer. Their town also gets a big heat wave. The superstore takes all of the energy used for the town's air conditioners. Peter wants to protest, but the superstore's air conditioning makes him feel better.

Brian and Stewie use Meg's tank to destroy the superstore. When the superstore gets destroyed, Peter gets his job at the brewery back and their air conditioning works again.\nProduction.\n\"Hell Comes to Quahog\" was written by Kirker Butler. Dan Povenmire is the director of the episode. Many parts of the episode were not shown on television for being too violent or offensive. One of these parts was a disabled child petting Brian too rough. Brian bites the child. Another part shows a man watching the movie \"Madagascar\" while driving a car.

He thought that the jokes were very funny and thought that the 5th season would make \"Family Guy\" as great as how the show started. Brett Love from TV Squad thought that the episode was better than the 5th season's first two episodes (\"Stewie Loves Lois\" and \"Mother Tucker\"). However, Love thought that the episode was too similar to the \"South Park\" episode \"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\". Love did not like how Peter was shown to be \"retarded\" after getting the job at the superstore, saying \"Sometimes it plays really funny, and sometimes it just gets annoying.\""}

Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping,\nLulled by the resonant song of your seas,\nWhen, set in your golden valleys,\nThe bold navigator found you;\nAnd on seeing, enraptured, your beauty,\nAnd feeling your enchantment,\nHe dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem\nof your splendid mantle.\n2. From a country where the sun rises,\nBeyond the blue Atlantic,\nThat man who had dreamt you\nIn search of you he launched to sea.\nWhen you raised your pale forehead,\nIn the lively anxiousness of your hope,\nUnder the gentle dome of your sky,\nAlready floated a strange banner.\n3. It was useless that your beloved Indian\nRushed into the fight with ire,\nBecause, covered with his blood, Lempira,\nIn the deep night he sank;\nAnd of the heroic deed, in memory,\nThe legend alone has kept\nA sepulcher in a forgotten place,\nAnd the severe profile of a mountain peak.\n4. For three centuries your children heard\nThe imperious mandate of the master;\nFor three centuries your useless complaint\nIn the blue atmosphere was lost\nBut one glorious day your ear\nPerceived, powerful and distant,\nThat there, far away, over the Atlantic,\nIndignantly, a lion roared\n5. It was France, the free, the heroic,\nWhich in its dreams of centuries slept,\nAwoke irate to life\nAt the virile protest of Danton:\nIt was France, who sent to the death\nThe head of the consecrated King,\nAnd which built up proudly at its side,\nThe altar of the goddess of Reason.\n6. You also, oh my country!, arose\nFrom your servile deep sleep;\nYou also showed the world\nThe infamous shackle destroyed.\nAnd in your blessed soil, behind the tall\nHair of the wild jungle,\nLike a bird of black feathers,\nThe fleeting colony was lost.\n7. To guard this sacred emblem\nWe shall march, oh fatherland, to our death;\nOur death will be honoured\nIf we die thinking of your love.\nHaving defended your holy flag,\nAnd shrouded in its glorious folds,\nMany, Honduras, shall die for you,\nBut shall fall in honour.\nYour flag is a splendour of sky,\nCrossed with a band of snow;\nAnd there can be seen, in its sacred depths,\nFive pale blue stars.\nIn your emblem, which a rough sea,\nWith its wild waves protects,\nBehind the bare summit of a volcano,\nA star brightly shines."}

This phenomenon is called cocktail party effect. It is named after the fact that a person attending a noisy cocktail party is able to focus their listening to the conversation they are doing, and disregard the other conversations. \nIt has been proposed that one's sensory memory subconsciously parses all stimuli and identifies discrete pieces of information by classifying them by salience. This effect is what allows most people to \"tune into\" a single voice and \"tune out\" all others. This phenomenon is often described in terms of \"selective attention\" or \"selective hearing\". It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance coming from unattended stimuli, for example hearing one's name among a wide range of auditory input.\nAn inability to segregate stimuli in this way is sometimes referred to as the cocktail party problem or cocktail party deafness."}

Nowadays fintech is the basis for all online transactions - money transfers, loans and more. Many technology startups and large organizations that try to improve financial services are considered to be a part of fintech.\nFinTech refers to new applications, processes, products or business models in the field of financial services that are provided through the Internet. Services may be provided by different independent providers at the same time. Usually it includes at least one licensed bank or insurance company. Their interaction is often regulated by special laws and regulations, such as the European Payment Services Directive.\nFinTech companies are special because of the ability to create innovations.\nMeaning and history.\nIt was said by the Professor of the School of Management in Friborg Patrick Schueffel that \"Fintech is a new financial industry that uses technology to improve its financial performance\". It is considered to be the meaning of the term.\nThe word fintech was first published in the 1980s: an article by Peter Knight entitled FinTech was published in the Sunday Times. It meant the bot that made the changes to his email.\nThe companies in the field of fintech began to grow rapidly and changed a lot after the global financial crisis in 2008. Large corporations began to invest in the fintech business, which was like an alternative to the old business models of the financial sector. Traditional banks, on the other hand, had millions of customers who wanted new service standards.\nIn Ukraine, the state promotes the development of fintech in accordance with the Strategy approved by the National Bank of Ukraine in July 2020.\nCurrently more than 100 fintech companies are working in Ukraine and their amount is increasing.\nTypes of financial projects.\nThere are more than 10,000 fintech companies operating in different fields in the world.\nFintech ecosystem.\nIt is a set of tools that a financial institution provides to third-party business structures to create and develop its own innovative services.

{"id": "827019", "revid": "7881341", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827019", "title": "Big Three television networks", "text": "The Big Three television networks are the three biggest television networks in the United States that are still running. These networks are ABC, CBS, and NBC. The Big Three networks ruled over television in the United States until the 1990s. To this day, they are still considered major, long-lasting United States television networks.\nBackgrounds.\nNBC and CBS were both founded as radio networks in the 1920s. Later on, NBC would have two radio networks for the United States. These networks were the Red Network and the Blue Network. They soon began television stations in the 1930s. In 1943, the U.S. government noticed how unfair it was for NBC to have two networks. They forced NBC to sell one of their networks. NBC chose to sell the Blue Network. Later on, the Blue Network became the ABC.\nThe DuMont Television Network launched in 1944. The three networks once controlled a few television stations. After a while, they affiliated with other stations to cover almost the entire United States by the late 1950s. Most of these stations are affiliated somehow with all three major networks and DuMont in markets where only one or two television stations operated in the early years of commercial television. It made some TV shows hard to handle. As more stations signed on, ABC, NBC, and CBS could carry enough programming on one station.\nDuMont did not have a radio network like ABC or CBS. During all this, the Mutual Broadcasting System had considered creating a TV network. They would have Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer make some of the programming. WOR-TV &amp; WOIC were known as \"Mutual Television.\" This is the only evidence of the television network. Mutual then bought a stake in the Overmyer Network in 1967. That network never succeeded.\nNetwork competition.\nEarly years.\nFor most of television history, the Big Three controlled most of television. DuMont stopped airing in 1955. From 1961 to the early 1990s, there were only three networks. Every hit series and every feature movie was aired by one of the Big Three networks.\nThere were attempts to become the fourth network. But they never work out. The cost of starting a network, the difficulty of competing with the Big Three and broadcasting were common in the 1980s. The Big Three had just enough stations to defeat anyone who tried to be just like them. Those networks that could have had the chance to compete would shut down because of legal threats.\nFox.\nAn attempt for a fourth television network for the Big Three would not happen again until Fox was founded in October 1986. Fox became a fourth network in 1994 after a law forcing cable providers to add local stations was approved. The rules allowed Fox to become recognized by most audiences and become the fourth network.\nFox has beaten ABC and NBC in the ratings for its primetime programming. This made Fox become the second most-watched network behind CBS during the 2000s. From 2007 to 2008, Fox was the highest-rated of the big broadcast networks. Fox was even the first non-Big Three network to reach first place. From 2004 to 2012, Fox became known for its 18-49 demographic shows. Because of its success, it has been included with the Big Three. It was used with the term \"Big Four.\"\nAlthough Fox is known as the nation's fourth major network, it is not considered part of the Big Three. One reason being that Fox reduced its weekday programming. It does not have enough national morning and evening news programs. Fox does not feature any daytime programming, enough primetime, late-night talk shows, and Saturday morning children's programming. Fox had a block for children's programs in the 1990s called Fox Kids. Sadly, it was sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2001 as part of Fox Family Channel.\nOutside of prime time, Fox affiliates either make their programming or run syndicated shows. Fox also allows affiliates the option to air the Xploration Station block on Saturday mornings in place of the optional Weekend Marketplace infomercials block.\nFifth and sixth networks.\nOther networks soon launched in an attempt to compete with the Big Three as well as Fox. However, these \"netlets\" were not as successful as Fox. The WB and UPN launched in 1995. Just like Fox, they both added nights of prime time programming a few years later. The WB was the only one that aired any on weekends.\nBoth networks only aired prime time and children's programming. The children's programming was the only form of weekday daytime programming offered by either one. UPN discontinued its children's programming in 2003 after a deal with Disney. After that, UPN aired sports events such as the XFL, as well as \"WWF SmackDown!\".\nAlthough The WB and UPN both had some popular series during their time, they struggled from poor viewership and financial losses. It led their parent companies (Time Warner and CBS Corporation) to shut them down in 2006. They soon joined together in a joint venture called The CW. It originally had a mix of programs from their past networks. But they soon made new shows after the launch.\nFox launched MyNetworkTV at the same time as The CW, with a lineup of English language telenovelas. Later on, it shifted towards unscripted programs and movies. But because of low ratings, it led News Corporation to convert the channel into a syndication service in 2009.\nPBS.\nLike Fox, the PBS is not considered part of the Big Three networks. PBS is a noncommercial service with a different distribution model compared to the major networks. Its stations own the network rather than the network owning some of its stations and affiliating with additional stations owned by other broadcasters. It keeps memberships with more than one educational station.\nMarket share.\nToday, the \"Big Three\" only control a small portion of the television market in the United States. It has suffered as a result of growing competition from other networks. Traditional networks such as Fox, The CW, and MyNetworkTV, Spanish language networks such as Univision and Telemundo, even national cable and satellite channels such as TNT, ESPN, and AMC, and web channels such as Netflix are sharing the space as well."}

At the time, it was agreed that the plays included in the First Folio (1623) were to be gathered together or \"compiled\" by John Heminges and Henry Condell. They were two long-time coworkers of Shakespeare in the King's Men. The play manuscripts may have been proofread and prepared for printing by Edward Knight. He is the \"book-keeper\" or prompter of the company. The task of proofreading and correcting the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the compositors and printers in the print-shop.\nNot a lot is known about the making of the Second (1632), Third (1663\u201364), and Fourth Folios (1685).\nThe 18th century.\nIn the 18th century, some people made the first coordinated efforts to fix the problems that the Folios presented.\nThe 19th century.\nThe early 19th century saw the first Variorum editions of Shakespeare's works. These are editions that organized and combine the efforts of all the editors from the 18th century. The first edition edited by Isaac Reed released in 1803. The second edition released in 1813 changed a few things from the first. The third edition edited by James Boswell released in 1821.\nThese editions set the standards for professionally fixing works such as Shakespeare's works. The text was permanently set in the Cambridge edition. It was also set by the Globe edition (1864). It continued on by the New Cambridge edition in 1921. Now, all editions come mostly from this edition.\nThe Cambridge Shakespeare (1863\u201366), moved away from a single editor following his own instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by William George Clark and John Glover. And the later eight volumes by Clark and William Aldis Wright. Clark and Wright also created the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts. Together, these editions became the standard for a while.\nThe 20th century.\nThe most wonderful edition in the twentieth century was the Oxford Shakespeare. It was edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor. It looks to show the scripts as they were originally written."}

It was under the Screen Antics brand and was said to be \"the world's first story-telling screen saver\".\nA man, Johnny Castaway, is stuck on a very small island with one palm tree. He often fishes, builds sand castles, and jogs. Other things happen less often, such as a mermaid or Lilliputian pirates coming to the island, or a seagull flying down to steal his shorts while he is bathing. Much like the castaways of \"Gilligan's Island\", he is sometimes almost rescued, but is still on the island because of accidents.\nEaster eggs happen on some holidays or events often celebrated in the United States, such as Halloween, Christmas and Independence Day, in which a related thing also appears. For example, the palm tree has a \"Happy New Year\" banner during the last week of the year, and a Jack-o'-lantern is in the sand on Halloween. The time on the computer can be changed to the time of the holiday or event to make it happen at the wrong time.\nJohnny Castaway came on a 3\u00bd-inch floppy disk and required a computer with, at minimum, a 386SX CPU and Windows 3.1. Now it is widely available on the internet, but because it requires 16-bit software components that do not work in modern versions of Windows, it only works on older versions of Microsoft Windows without workarounds, which exist on Windows 64-bit, Mac OS X and Linux.\nShawn Bird designed the characters while he was at Dynamix. The program was developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions, the Jeff Tunnell in the name meaning the founder of Dynamix. Ken Williams said the screensaver was one of Dynamix's products that did not cost much money to create and make, and made them much more money, along with The Incredible Machine and Hoyle Card Games, which Sierra also published.\nReviews.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" said \"Johnny Castaway\" was \"a great launch\" for Screen Antics and \"Fans of Johnny Hart-style comics and sight gag lovers everywhere should love it\"."}

They are usually associated with surveying. They are often mounted on a special kind of tripod.\nThey are usually a telescope on a mount that can move horizontally (left and right) and vertically (up and down). The mount has a scale where the readings are taken, usually in degrees for older models and arc minutes or arc seconds for newer models. The telescope normally has a crosshair to make it easy to align it to the points to be surveyed. The theodolite was the first tool that could do vertical and horizontal measurements in the same device.\nMost modern theodolites are electronic and the readings are read from a digital display.\nA \"transit\" is a kind of theodolite that can do a whole circle vertically and horizontally."}

Gold played on scores of records by other artists, most notably Linda Ronstadt's. He had his own success with the U.S. Top 40 hits \"Lonely Boy\" (1977) and \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" (1978), as well as the UK Top Five hit \"Never Let Her Slip Away\" (1978). In the 1980s, he had further international chart success as half of Wax, a collaboration with 10cc's Graham Gouldman.\nDuring the 1990s, Gold produced, composed, performed on and wrote tracks for films, commercials, and television soundtracks, such as \"Final Frontier\", the theme of the sitcom \"Mad About You\". Some of his older works later experienced newfound popularity: \"Thank You for Being a Friend\" was used as the opening theme for \"The Golden Girls\", and the children's novelty song \"Spooky Scary Skeletons\" (1996) became an Internet meme in the 2010s. In 1997, Gold released a tribute to 1960s psychedelic music, \"Greetings from Planet Love\", issued under the pseudonym \"the Fraternal Order of the All\"."}

Greg Colton is the director of the episode.\nStory.\nMort (the Griffin family's Jewish friend) goes to the Griffin family's house and needs to use bathroom. He thinks that Stewie's time machine is a bathroom and goes inside. The time machine takes Mort somewhere in the past. Mort can not go back to the present because he does not have a return pad (a machine that will take him back to the present). Brian and Stewie get a return pad and go to the past. They learn that Mort is at Warsaw on September 1, 1939, right before Poland is invaded and World War II starts. Mort is in a synagogue with his ancestors.\nBrian and Stewie's return pad does not work. They try to take Mort to England so he is safe from Nazis. German officers find them cross a border and go after them. Brian, Stewie, and Mort get in a motorbike to get away from the officers. They steal a U-boat and make it to England. The return pad does not have uranium to work. Brian says that the only place that has uranium is in a nuclear power plant in Berlin, Nazi Germany. They join the Royal Air Force and get in a dogfight with Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. They make it to the nuclear power plant in Berlin. Stewie makes himself look like Adolf Hitler so he can get uranium. They find the real Hitler, who wants them executed. They get the uranium needed for the return pad and makes it go to the present.\nThey make it in Stewie's room 30 seconds before Mort first went in the time machine. Stewie kills the Mort that was in Germany by putting him in the time machine and destroying it with a raygun. The first Mort does not make it to the bathroom quick enough.\nProduction.\n\"Road to Germany\" was written by Patrick Meighan. Greg Colton is the director of the episode. It is the 4th episode of the \"Road to ...\" series, episodes where Brian and Stewie go to places outside of Quahog. The episodes are a parody of the \"Road to ...\" movies with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. \"Road to Germany\" and other episodes from the 7th season were put on a DVD on June 16, 2009.\nReception.\nAbout 9.07 million people watched the episode when it was first broadcast. Ahsan Haque from IGN said that the episode is \"one of the best episodes of the show in years.\" He talks about how the animation is \"gorgeous\", the story being exciting, and the episode's \"hilarous offensive humor\". Alex Rocha from \"TV Guide\" thought that the episode was \"average\" when in comparison to episodes that were broadcast before it. Francis Rizzo III from DVD Talk said that the episode is \"hugely memorable\" and said the episode's animation is one of the best in \"Family Guy\".\n\"Family Guy\" got a nomination for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2009. It was the first animated television show to be nominated for the award since \"The Flintstones\" in 1961. This episode was one of the three episode that was given for the nomination. The other two were \"Family Gay\" and \"I Dream of Jesus\". Seth MacFarlane (creator of \"Family Guy\") said that those episodes were submitted because they were \"\" shows."}

It may mean a group of living things that are not dependent on other communities. It may mean a small group, such as the living things in a piece of dead wood. Populations of many species make up a community when joined together. A community with its physical and chemical environment makes an ecosystem. Each population can have an effect on other populations in the community in different ways, which are called symbiosis.\nIn consumption, one living thing eats another. Three kinds of consumption are predation, herbivory, and parasitism. In predation, one animal, the predator, kills and eats another animal, the prey. In herbivory, an animal called an herbivore eats a plant, either in part or in whole. In parasitism, a parasite lives on another living thing, the host. The parasite eats small parts of tissue or nutrients from the host, but usually does not kill it.\nIn competition, two living things, from the same or different species, both need the same resources. If one species is better at getting the resources, the population of the other species may die out. Competition may have a negative effect on both species. In mutualism, two species both help each other, so they have a positive effect on each other. In commensalism, one species is helped, but it has no effect on the other species."}

She was one of the most popular Russian women, and who was important both for Turkey and Russia. She was taken by the Tatars and was brought as a gift to the sultan. Then she became part of a harem and became a wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Her real name and place of birth is unknown. Polish and Russian literature state her name was is Alexandra, but in Ukrainian literature she is presented as Anastasia. \nPeople say different things about her personality. Some think she was patriotic and did a lot for her country while others are sure she was mean and selfish.\nOrigin.\nSources say Roxelana is from Ruthenia, which was then part of the Polish Crown and Russia. \nUkrainian nationalist writers say she was born in the town of Rohatyn. \nDuring the reign of Selim I (between the 1510s to 1520), Crimean Tatars took her during one of their Crimean\u2013Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe. In Istanbul, she was chosen as a gift for Suleiman. Later Hurrem became a favorite of Suleiman in the Ottoman imperial harem.\nPersonality.\nHurrem was described as a attractive woman, who was different from everybody else because of her red hair. She also was intelligent and had a pleasant personality. She loved poetry very much. It is considered it was one of the reasons why Suleiman liked her more. He also admired reading poems. \nHurrem was also known for being generous. She built a lot of religious, cultural and resting places for pilgrims travelling to the Islamic city of Mecca. Her greatest charity work was the Great Wall of Jerusalem, a large soup kitchen that fed the poor. \nCritics also state that Hurrem was a selfish, manipulative and angry woman who would kill anyone who stood in her way. Even despite her charity, many people still believe she was not kind. \nPavlo Zahrebelnyi described Hurrem as \"an intelligent, kind, understanding, openhearted, candid, talented, generous, emotional and grateful woman who cares about the soul rather than the body; in short, a perfect woman\". \nChildren.\nShe had 6 children with Suleiman \u2014 5 sons and a daughter, Mihrimah."}

The stadium was originally suppose to host the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final, but this was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. However, UEFA is moved to Portgual. The winners of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2021\u201322 UEFA Champions League group stage, and will also play against the winners of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League in the 2021 UEFA Super Cup. They will also qualify for the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan.\nBayern Munich are holding the current title, but was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Paris Saint-Germain. Paris Saint-Germain was the opponent whom Bayern Munich defeated in the previous final.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participate in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which does not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nDistribution.\nThe following is the access list for this season.\nChanges were made to the default access list since the Champions League title holders, Bayern Munich, and the Europa League title holders, Sevilla, which were guaranteed berths in the Champions League group stage, already qualified for the Champions League group stage via their domestic leagues. However, as a result of schedule delays to both the 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321 European seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020\u201321 European season started before the conclusion of the 2019\u201320 European season. Therefore, the changes to the access list that should be made based on the Champions League and Europa League title holders could not be certain until matches of the earlier qualifying rounds had been played and/or their draws had been made. UEFA used \"adaptive re-balancing\" to change the access list once the berths for the Champions League and Europa League title holders were determined, and rounds which had already been drawn or played by the time the title holders were determined would not be impacted (Regulations Article 3.04). The following changes were made:\nTeams.\nIn early April 2020, UEFA announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the deadline for entering the tournament had been postponed until further notice. UEFA also sent a letter to all member associations that domestic leagues must be completed in full without ending prematurely in order to qualify for European competitions. After meeting with the 55 UEFA associations on 21 April 2020, UEFA strongly recommended them to finish domestic top league and cup competitions, although in some special cases where it is not possible, UEFA would develop guidelines concerning participation in its club competitions in case of a cancelled league or cup. After the UEFA Executive Committee meeting on 23 April 2020, UEFA announced that if a domestic competition is prematurely terminated for legitimate reasons in accordance with conditions related to public health or economic problems, the national associations concerned are required to select their participating teams for the 2020\u201321 UEFA club competitions based on sporting merit in the 2019\u201320 domestic competitions, and UEFA reserves the right to refuse their admission if UEFA deems the termination of the competitions not legitimate, or the selection procedure not objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, or the team is perceived by the public as qualifying unfairly. A suspended domestic competition may also be restarted with a different format from the original one in a manner which would still facilitate qualification on sporting merit. All leagues should communicate to UEFA by 25 May 2020 whether they intend to restart their competitions, but this deadline was later extended. On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced that associations must enter their teams by 3 August 2020.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\nThe second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round are divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).\nNotes\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless otherwise stated). The tournament would originally have started in June 2020, but had been delayed to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The new schedule was announced by the UEFA Executive Committee on 17 June 2020. All qualifying matches, excluding the play-off round, were played as single leg matches, hosted by one of the teams decided by draw (except the preliminary round which was played at neutral venue).\nThe group stage draw was originally to be held at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens, Greece, but UEFA announced on 9 September 2020 that it would be relocated to Nyon, but it was eventually held at nearby Geneva.\nThe original schedule of the competition, as planned before the pandemic, was as follows (all draws held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the following special rules are applicable to the competition:\nOn 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that five substitutions would be permitted from the group stage onward, with a sixth allowed in extra time. However, each team is only given three opportunities to make substitutions during matches, with a fourth opportunity in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. Consequently, a maximum of twelve players can be listed on the substitute bench.\nAll qualifying matches were played behind closed doors. Following the partial return of fans at the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, UEFA announced on 1 October 2020 that matches from the group stage onward could be played at 30% capacity if allowed by the local authorities.\nQualifying rounds.\nFirst qualifying round.\nThe draw for the first qualifying round was held on 9 August 2020, 12:00 CEST. The matches were played on 18 and 19 August 2020. The match between K\u00cd and Slovan Bratislava was cancelled due to Slovan Bratislava players being put into quarantine after one player had tested positive for coronavirus, and K\u00cd were awarded a technical 3\u20130 win.\n&lt;section end=Q1 /&gt;\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe draw for the second qualifying round was held on 10 August 2020, 12:00 CEST. The matches were played on 25 and 26 August 2020.\nFrom the ten losers of Champions Path, two teams, Tirana and Ludogorets Razgrad, determined by a draw held on 31 August 2020 after the Europa League second qualifying round draw,entered the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League play-off round (Champions Path), while the other eight teams entered the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round (Champions Path). The losers of League Path entered the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round (Main Path).\nThird qualifying round.\nThe losers of Champions Path entered the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League play-off round (Champions Path). The losers of League Path entered the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League group stage.\nPlay-off round.\nThe losers of both Champions Path and League Path entered the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League group stage.\nGroup stage.\nA total of 32 teams play in the group stage, from 15 countries: 26 teams which entered in this stage, and the six winners of the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path).\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 1 October 2020, 17:00 CEST, at the RTS Studios in Geneva, Switzerland. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (introduced starting 2015\u201316 season):\nIn each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams enter the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League round of 32. The matchdays are 20\u201321 October, 27\u201328 October, 3\u20134 November, 24\u201325 November, 1\u20132 December and 8\u20139 December 2020.\nThe youth teams of the clubs that qualify for the group stage also participate in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Youth League, along with the youth domestic champions of the top 32 associations, in a single leg knockout tournament.\n\u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, Krasnodar, Midtjylland and Rennes made their debut appearances in the group stage. With \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir's appearance in the group stage, Istanbul became the first city that has been represented in the group stage by four different teams (had been previously represented by Be\u015fikta\u015f, Fenerbah\u00e7e and Galatasaray). This season became the first in the history of the Champions League in which three Russian clubs will play in the group stage.\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.\nSquad of the season.\nThe UEFA technical study group selected the following 23 players as the squad of the tournament."}

General Maurice Challe had the idea for the Challe Plan. It lasted from 6 February 1959 - 6 April 1961.\nOperation.\nIn Plan Challe, the French Army attacked the FLN fighters. The French sent reserve units and conscript units to defend places in which they would not have to be moblie such as to protect roads. That way, regular French army units could perform search and destroy missions in the mountains, where guerrilla fighters were hiding. The army used helicopters to move special mobile units composed of elite troops such as Foreign Legionnaires, paratroopers, marines, special commandos units, and air mobile regulars. The elite forces never exceeded more than 20,000 soldiers.\nPlan Challe was a series of sweeps into places in which the French army knew guerrilla fighters were hiding. By taking regular troops away from defence, Challe broke down large formations into small units, many of which had both French soldiers and Algerian soldiers in them. The groups of soldiers could move quickly so that the guerrillas had to fight them in rough country.\n\"The highly sophisticated operational and tactical scenario was virtually the same. Utilizing primarily air-gathered intelligence and without warning, the elite units and the air force move at tremendous speed onto enemy territory. The strike usually takes place at dawn. First, the target area is bombed out of existence and showered with cluster bombs from fighter jets and bombers. Within few minutes, the paratroopers land in the heart of the insurgent territory with close air support provided by armed helicopters. The elite force engages immediately the insurgents while fighters, bombers, armed helicopters patrolled the battle space and strafe or bomb any insurgents leaving the area. Additional troops are brought in by helicopters to close the immediate net around the insurgents. A larger contingent of regular troops and Commandos de chasse (hunter class troops) are convoyed to several spots around the battle space to ambush and pursue the survivors. The aircraft are relieved when the area is under control by the elite troops and when the regular contingent is in place. The command and control post (Joint Operations Command) is always shared by Air Force and Army commanders. The operation is dismantled at sundown and the elite troops are withdrawn leaving the local (secteur) regular troop to finish the job and keep the area clean. It was devastating to the FLN, in terms of lives and moral.\"\nAftermath.\nPlan Challe was a clear military victory for France. The FLN had only around 5,000 soldiers left because many of them had fled from Algeria to nearby countries like Morocco and Tunisia, where the FLN leadership was based. The fighters that did not flee Algeria were forced into hiding because the French military presence was overwhelming.\nPlan Challe helped France to win the Algerian War militarily and led to Charles de Gaulle on 29 June 1961 announcing on live television that fighting in Algeria was virtually over. The military side of the conflict in Algeria had almost ended, but the political side of the conflict would continue."}

{"id": "828568", "revid": "1102992", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=828568", "title": "Nokia 3310 (2017)", "text": "\"This is about the 2017 Nokia 3310. For the original, see Nokia 3310.\"\nNokia 3310 (2017) is a smartphone that is a remodel of the Nokia 3310. It is also known as the Nokia 3310 (2017 Edition). It was announced on February 26, 2017, in the Mobile World Congress at Barcelona as the Nokia 3310 2017 Edition, debuting as a 2G smartphone. Nokia released the 3G model on October 29, 2017.\nLaunch.\nOn February 14, 2017, it was reported that a newer version of the 3310 would be released at the 2017 Mobile World Congress that is held in Barcelona by HMD Global Oy, a Finnish manufacturer which made Nokia phones. The price was set to be 59 euros. On the 26th, the phone was relaunched at 49 euros.\nThe first release of the phone only came with 2G support, which led to issues, especially as countries like the United States, Australia and Singapore were in the process of phasing out their 2G networks. A new version of the phone with support for 3G networks was later announced by HMD, and released on 29 October 2017.\nFunctions and design.\nThe 3310 has things like an FM radio, the Opera Mini web browser, a voice recorder, and a 2-megapixel camera with flash for photos and video recording. The flash LED is also the phone's flashlight. Some models have Bluetooth 3.0 and a dual-SIM tray. The display has a polarized layer for outdoor use.\nThe original \"Snake\" game has been replaced by Gameloft's \"Snake Xenzia\" with updated modes and graphics. It is also possible to sideload Java-based applications using the .jad and .jar format. Available apps are browsers, games, internet radios, etc.\nThe design of the phone is very similar to the Nokia 3310. It comes in two glossy colors, red and yellow, as well as two matte colors similar to the original Nokia 3310: dark blue and grey.\n3G version.\nThe 3G model has many differences apart from the 3G radio. The internal storage has been increased from 16 megabytes to 128 megabytes, and there are some cosmetic changes, including a new silver keypad. It comes in four new colors: yellow, \"warm\" red, azure and charcoal, all matte. The phone's size has slightly increased to make typing on the keypad easier. The radio has reduced battery talk time, but slightly increased standby time. All 3310 3G versions support Bluetooth 2.1.\nThe 3310 3G also runs a Java-based operating system that HMD calls \"Smart Feature OS\". Its appearance is similar to the Series 30+ as on the 2G version, but has a new customizable interface. However, only sim-slot 1 is 3G compatible, the slot 2 is still only 2G capable.\n4G version.\nA 4G version was released in January 2018 in China in a partnership with China Mobile. It runs AliOS, a fork of Android, and can create Wi-Fi hotspots using the LTE data connection. Internal storage has been increased to 512 megabytes, and 64 gigabyte memory cards are now supported.\nReception.\nHMD announced on 2 July 2017 that the 3310 received great demand and was as a result sold out in many markets. UK retailer Carphone Warehouse said on 10 March that demand was \"astonishing\".\nThe new 3310 received mixed reviews. CNET praised the phone's battery life, price, and durability, but \"Techradar\" and \"The Guardian\" said the device doesn't have many features that modern smartphones users are used to. Most reviewers liked the nostalgia of playing the iconic Snake game.\nSome counterfeit versions of the phone have been produced due to the model's popularity."}

It is offal, which means it is not muscle tissue. The flavor might be strong for some people, so it might be slightly over-seasoned.\nThe liver stores vitamin A and other things. Vitamin A is used by the body to make rhodopsin, a molecule which absorbs light. It is needed for low-level vision and colour vision. Vitamin A also plays a key role in gene transcription. It also plays a key role in the immune system.\nOnce made, vitamin A cannot be broken down by the body, and it is not easily excreted. So it tends to build up in the liver if too much is eaten. Vitamin A is fat-soluble, so getting rid of any excess taken in through diet takes much longer than with water-soluble B vitamins and vitamin C. This allows for toxic levels of vitamin A to build up.\nIt is not good to eat cooked liver too often. Eating lots of liver, especially from carnivorous animals, will give a person too much vitamin A."}

{"id": "829009", "revid": "1068258", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=829009", "title": "Hessian dialects", "text": "Hessian (German: \"Hessisch\") is a group of German dialects, characterized as a Central German dialect according to its share in the High German sound shift and spoken mainly in Hesse, but also in some areas in Franconia, Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia.\nHessian, together with Palatine on the one hand and a mixed area between Hessian, Palatine, South Franconian (\"Badisch\") and East Franconian in the Rhine-Main-Neckar area on the other hand, forms the Rhine Franconian. Lorraine Franconian is also partially counted as part of Rhine Franconian.\nThe absence of the transition from \"p\" &gt; \"(p)f\" (Appel for \"apple\", German: \"Apfel\") marks Rhine Franconian, together with Moselle Franconian and Ripuarian, as a West Central German dialect.\n\"Hessian\" in the sense of the traditional dialect is not to be confused with the modern New Hessian regiolect.\nGeographical distribution and division.\nThe distribution area of Hessian dialects occupies the state of Hesse except for the extreme north and northeast, part of Rhineland-Palatinate (Westerwald, Rhenish Hesse, Taunus), North Rhine-Westphalia (Wittgensteiner Land) and Bavaria (Bavarian Lower Main).\nOne distinguishes\nLinguistic description.\nPhonology.\nLinguistic boundaries are the isoglosses \"ich\" (Hessian) / \"ik\" (Low German) as well as \"machen\" (Hessian) / \"maken\" (Low German) northward to Low Saxon and Westphalian, \"Pund\" (Hessian) / \"Fund\" (Thuringian) eastward to Thuringian, \"Pund\" (Hessian) / \"Pfund\" (East Franconian) as well as \"Appel\" (Hessian) / \"Apfel\" (East Franconian) eastward to East Franconian, \"was\" (Hessian) / \"wat\" (Ripuarian/Moselle Franconian) westward to Moselle Franconian and \"fest\" (Hessian) / \"fescht\" (Palatine) to the Rhine Franconian/Palatine/East Franconian mixed area southward. As can be seen from the bounding isoglosses, Hessian is subject to the High German sound shift with respect to \"t\" &gt; \"s\" and \"k\" &gt; \"ch/h\", but unlike East Central German, it does not show the \"p\" &gt; \"f\" transition.\nThe border to the Low German language area is marked by a here spatially very narrowly limited isoglossic bundle - the Benrath line, which here, unlike west and east, is hardly fanned out. This language boundary (or \"maken-machen\" or \"ik-ich\" line) between Low German and Central German language varieties or Hessian belongs to the dialect continuum, but it is probably one of the most sharply formed transitional areas in the German language area. In contrast, the border to the south is characterized by particularly wide isoglosses and is correspondingly blurred. The transition to Palatine, to East Franconian and to Thuringian is fluent.\nCharacteristic is the lack of distinction between voiced and unvoiced \"s\" or \"sch\" as well as in South and Central Hessian between \"ch\" on the one hand and \"sch\" on the other. All these sounds tend to be pronounced voiced, so that phonetically, for example, there is hardly any difference between \"Kirche\" and \"Kirsche\" or between \"wei\u00dfe\" and \"weise\". This leads also in High German partly to hypercorrection (\"Kirchbaum\" instead of \"Kirschbaum\").\nLexic.\nHessian is characterized by residual occurrences of particularly ancient words whose root words hardly occur in other dialects or languages, such as \"idrecken\", \"itarucken\" for ruminate, \"densen\", \"dinsen\" for \"to pull at something with all one's might\" and ehren \"(\u00e4hren)\" for ackern/plow.\nThe Hessian vocabulary is documented by three multi-volume dictionaries, the \"S\u00fcdhessisches W\u00f6rterbuch\" (completed, 6 volumes), the \"Hessen-Nassauisches Volksw\u00f6rterbuch\" (in progress), and the \"Frankfurter W\u00f6rterbuch\" (completed, 6 volumes).\nFrom the 19th century come A. G. E. Vilmar's \"Idiotikon von Kurhessen\" (Marburg/Leipzig 1868) and Hermann von Pfister's \"Mundartliche und stammheitliche Nachtr\u00e4ge\" \"zu A. F. C. Vilmar's Idiotikon von Hessen\" (Marburg 1886).\nGrammar.\nSouth of the Main, the preterite (past tense) is absent and replaced by the perfect (present perfect); north of the Main, on the other hand, preterite forms are common. In the south, standard German is \"ich kam\", i.e., \"ich bin kumme\", whereas in the north, \"ich k\u00e5m\". A second important, albeit Gemeindeutsch difference to standard German is the replacement of the genitive by prepositional and dative periphrases. Thus, instead of \"Georg's book\" it is \"des Buch vum Schorsch\" or \"em \"Schorsch soi Buch\".\"\nHessian syntax was studied in the 2010s at the Philipps University of Marburg as part of the project \"SyHD: Syntax of Hessian Dialects.\"\nBibliography.\nHessian Dictionaries.\nAll information is in German."}
