It is a major industrial, commercial and cultural center, and remains the most important center of Tatar culture. Kazan lies at the meeting of the Volga (\u0130del) and Kazanka (Qazansu) rivers in central European Russia.\nName.\nThe origin of the name is unclear. The literal translation of Tatar qazan is a boiler or cauldron. Or, it may have come from qaz\u011fan, Tatar for \"dug [ditch]\".\n\"Qazan\" is originally a name for a special cooking pan, a kind of a wok, but heavier. It was believed that the city of Kazan is named after this object because of its geographical similarity with a \"qazan\"-pan; namely the city is in a U - shape lowland.\nAnother, more romantic legend tells a story of a Tatar princess S\u00f6yembik\u00e4, who dropped a golden dish (golden qazan) into the river on which the city is located while washing it.\nNevertheless, Chuvash legends refer to Bulgarian prince \"Khusan\" (Chuvash rendering of Muslim name Hassan) and Chuvashes call this city \u0425\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043d after the name of this prince.\nHistory.\nIn 2021, nine people were killed in a mass shooting."}
{"id": "22588", "revid": "470168", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22588", "title": "Tornado", "text": "A tornado is a tube of violently spinning air that touches the ground. Wind inside the tornado spins fast, but the actual 'circle' of wind around them is huge. This makes tornadoes very dangerous. Tornadoes are especially dangerous to people in cars or mobile homes and about 60 people are killed by tornadoes every year.\nWord origin tornado- 1550s, \"ternado\", navigator's word for violent windy thunderstorm in the tropical Atlantic, probably a mangled borrowing from Spanish \"tronada\" \"thunderstorm,\" from \"tronar\" \"to thunder,\" from Latin \"tonare\" \"to thunder\" (see thunder (n.)). Also in 17c. spelled \"tornatho\", \"tornathe\", \"turnado\"; modern spelling by 1620s. Metathesis of \"-o-\" and \"-r-\" in modern spelling influenced by Spanish \"tornar\" \"to twist, turn,\" from Latin \"tornare\" \"to turn.\" Meaning \"extremely violent whirlwind\" is first found 1620s; specifically \"destructive rotary funnel cloud\" (especially in the U.S. Midwest) from 1849. Related: \"Tornadic\".\nTornadoes destroy things. They can tear houses to pieces and often leave people homeless. Tornadoes can be caused by winds that have been going opposite directions with humidity. They are smaller than hurricane but stronger. Nearly three quarters of the world's tornadoes happen in the United States. However, they can happen anywhere.\nTornadoes mostly happen during strong thunderstorms called super cell storms. They cause a lot of damage to anything in their path. Tornadoes are ranked on the Enhanced Fujita scale, from EF0 to EF5. EF0 for tornados that caused the least damage, and EF5 for the ones that caused the most.\nTornadoes can happen in nearly any part of the world. In the United States, a tornado has happened in all states. The middle part of the United States is nicknamed 'Tornado Alley' for the number of tornadoes there. A tornado can have wind speeds of over 300 miles per hour (480\u00a0km/h). Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180\u00a0km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across and travel a few miles before disappearing. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil; downbursts are frequently confused with tornadoes, though their action is not similar.\nCharacteristics.\nCondensation funnel.\nA tornado does not necessarily need to be visible; however, the extremely low pressure caused by the high wind speeds and rapid rotation usually causes water vapor in the air to condense into a visible \"condensation funnel\". The tornado is the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.\nTornado family.\nA single storm may produce multiple tornadoes and mesocyclones. Tornadoes produced from the same storm are referred to as a \"tornado family\". Sometimes multiple tornadoes from distinct mesocyclones occur at the same time.\nOccasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same very large storm. If there is no break in their activity, this is considered a \"tornado outbreak\", although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a \"tornado outbreak sequence\", occasionally called an \"extended tornado outbreak\".\nSometimes, tornadoes happen in groups. 148 tornadoes struck on the same day in April 1974. Many towns in the midwestern United States and Canada were destroyed. More than 300 people died. They were hit by flying wrecks, buried under houses, and thrown by powerful winds. That day, students in Xenia, Ohio were practicing for a play on the auditorium stage. One girl looked out the window and saw the tornado. The students ran into the hall, covering their heads. A few seconds later, all the school buses flew right onto the stage.\nA man in another town hid under the couch in his living room. He held onto one couch leg. The tornado struck his house, and winds blew around him. When the tornado left, he was outside. There was no house. The couch had disappeared, and he was only holding onto one couch leg.\nDamage scale.\nThe Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by how much damage they cause. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale. The updated scale uses engineered wind estimates and has better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would get the same numerical rating, and was used in the United States since 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not big buildings, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them destroyed and even damage big skyscrapers.\nIn the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. Less than 1% of tornadoes are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger).\nTornado watches/warnings/emergencies.\nA \"tornado watch\" is given when the weather conditions look like a tornado could form. A 'PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation)' watch is given when a likely tornado outbreak is to start, many strong tornadoes will form in the area, or an ongoing tornado outbreak is in the works in the area. A \"tornado warning\" is given if somebody has actually seen a tornado or if a tornado 'signature' (usually the storm has a 'hook' or 'U' echo) has shown up on radar. Tornado emergencies are issued in Special Weather Statements or Tornado Warnings saying that a powerful tornado is about to hit an area with a lot of people in it (especially cities in Tornado Alley), a tornado has been spotted, and the tornado is expected to cause deaths.\nMyths and misconceptions.\nIt is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by a tornado. While there is a big drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.\nAnother common misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are stronger in the small space of an overpass. In the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly hit by tornadoes. At each of the three places there was a death, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.\nThere are areas which people believe to be safe from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, hit valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more likely to be hit than others.\nSafety tips.\nTo keep safe in a tornado, here are some tips you can follow:"}
{"id": "22591", "revid": "1070632", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22591", "title": "Hard disk", "text": "A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk or hard drive, is a data storage device for computers which uses magnetic storage to store data. The capacity of a hard drive is usually measured in gigabytes (GB), however hard disk capacity can also be measured in terabytes when the capacity is over 1000 gigabytes. A gigabyte is one thousand megabytes and a megabyte is one million bytes, which means that a gigabyte is one billion bytes. Some hard drives are so large that their capacity is measured in terabytes, (TB) where one terabyte is a thousand gigabytes (1 TB = 1000 GB).\nDifferent interfaces.\nOver the years there have been many disk interface types, though all used the same rotating platter recording technology. Differences were in how the data was encoded to binary, data integrity, data transfer speeds, cabling requirements, and cost. In 2009, it was common to attach a hard disk using a Serial ATA connection. The connection that came before that was called \"IDE\" and is called Parallel ATA today. In large data centers, Fibre Channel is often used.\nFor servers, the SCSI interface is very popular. There are several types and versions of SCSI interface, like parallel and Serial Attached SCSI, each stepping-up in terms of speed and price. Within servers, several SCSI drives are often used in conjunction with each other, in order to safeguard against data loss or corruption (this is known as RAID - and there are many configurations to choose from).\nComponents.\nAn HDD has a disk motor and an actuator motor that positions the read/write head. Wires from the actuator connect to the read/write head to amplifiers. They are bridged by the head support arm. In modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 \"g\", so a head support arm connects the actuator and the read/write head.\nThe actuator controls the read/write head and acts as a permanent magnet. A metal plate supports a squat neodymium-iron-boron (NIB) magnet. Beneath this plate is the voice coil, which is attached to the actuator hub. Beneath the actuator hub is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the bottom plate of the actuator.\nThe voice coil is shaped like an arrow. It is made up of a magnet with plastic insulation. This magnet interacts with the actuator magnet, causing the disk to move. If the magnetic field were uniform it would cancel out, but the surface magnet is divided between north and south poles in the middle so force is produced instead of canceled out.\nHard Drive Corruption.\nThere are several reasons behind the corruption of internal and external hard drive.\nVirus &amp; Malware Attack:- If a system is attacked by a virus, the important boot files stored in the internal hard disk may be deleted, leading to boot failure. Meanwhile, the crucial data and the complete partition may also be deleted by the virus or malware attack.\nDue to Physical Damage:- It is also called hardware failure, and consists the following types: Overheating of hard drive, Read/write head crash, Cracked or poor-contact data line, Scratch on magnetic platters, Short circuit in the control circuit board and much more. The data lost due to these kinds of reasons can hardly be repaired. A user have no choice but to turn to expert for data recovery from hardware damaged hard drive.\nCorruption of Boot Sector:- The boot sector is the first sector of the hard drive. This is used to load processor control and then move it to the Operating System. When, the boot sector is damaged, you will not be able to enter the system and access any data stored in the internal hard drive.\nDamaged file system:- The file system is used by the Operating System to define the approach for organizing files on the storage device. To be particular, it is like a gateway to access data stored on hard drive partitions. If the file system on the internal hard drive is unluckily damaged somehow, the drive may become inaccessible and the system may fail to start.\nSoftware Clash:- All kinds of applications you installed on your local machine currently may not able to be fully supportive with each other, so software clash occurs now and then to lead to sudden computer shutdown and cause internal hard drive corruption.\nClick of Death.\nWhen a hard disk fails to read the data (for example: if dropped, knocked over, or otherwise being damaged, the hard drive may start to click to indicate that it is damaged, or broken. \nThe clicking sound itself arises from the unexpected movement of the disk's read/write actuator. At startup, and during use, the disk head must move correctly and confirm it is correctly tracking data on the disk. If the head cannot do this, the disk controller may attempt to recover by retrying. This may cause an audible \"click\". In some devices, the process automatically retries, causing a repeated or rhythmic clicking sound, sometimes accompanied by the whirring sound of the drive plate spinning."}

When a magnet goes near a special kind of metal or other magnets, and the poles (sides) touching are opposite, it will pull, or \"attract\" the other metal or magnet closer. Also, if the two poles are the same, the two magnets will push away, or \"repel\", from each other. This is called \"magnetism\". Magnets can make some other metals into magnets when they are rubbed together. \nSoft magnets (or impermanent magnets are often used in electromagnets. These increase (often hundreds or thousands of times) the magnetic field of a wire that carries an electrical current and is wrapped around the magnet. The field also increases with the current. \nPermanent magnets have ferromagnetism. They occur naturally in some rocks, particularly lodestone, but are now commonly manufactured. A magnet's magnetism decreases when it is heated and increases when it is cooled. It has to be heated at around . Like poles (S-pole and S-pole/N-pole and N-pole) will repel each other while unlike poles (N-pole and S-pole) will attract each other.\nMagnets are only attracted to special metals. Iron, cobalt and nickel are magnetic. Metals that have iron in them attract magnets well. Steel is one. Metals like brass, copper, zinc and aluminum are not attracted to magnets. Non-magnetic materials such as wood and glass are not attracted to magnets as they do not have magnetic materials in them. \nNeodymium iron boron magnets and Alnico magnets are two kinds of permanent magnet.\nNatural magnets.\nNatural/permanent magnets are not artificial. They are a kind of rock called lodestone or magnetite. \nA compass uses the Earth's magnetic field, and points to the North magnetic pole. A north side of the magnet is attracted to the south side of another magnet. However, the north side of the compass points to the north pole, this can only mean that the \"north pole\" is really the magnetic south, and the \"South magnetic pole\" is really the magnetic north.\nThe first people to discover naturally magnetic rocks were the Chinese. At first, the Chinese used the stones to carry out fortune-telling and magic tricks. Later on they used these \"lodestones\" to invent the compass."}

He is a character created by nuts [Stan Lee]] and artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 in August 1962. The premise was that he was an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben as an ordinary teenager. He would deal with the normal struggles of being young as well as the struggles of being a costumed crime fighter. His powers were super strength, agility, the ability to cling to almost every surface, the ability to shoot spider-webs using a device that he invented which he calls \"web-shooters,\" and reacting to danger quickly with his \"spider-sense\", enabling him to combat many foes similar to that of a spider.\nSpider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, when teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The series featured Peter Parker, a high school student who frequently suffered the same rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness, that most young readers could easily relate to. Unlike some teen heroes, such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man never had any adult mentors like Captain America and Batman to teach him to be a superhero. He had to learn for himself that \"with great power comes great responsibility\" \u2014 a quote that he would cherish from his late Uncle Ben.\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series such as \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" and \"Sensational Spider-Man\" over the years. Peter Parker has developed from shy high school student to troubled but outgoing college student to married high school teacher. But his most associated adult role is that of being a single freelance photographer. He has also been a member of both the New Avengers, and the Fantastic Four. Spider-Man has had a lot of nicknames over the years such as being referred to as \"Spidey,\" \"web-slinger,\" \"wall-crawler,\" or \"web-head.\" He is also called \"arachnid\" by some villains and calls himself \"Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.\"\nSpider-Man has been one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. Often considered to be Marvel's flagship character and company mascot, he has appeared in many forms of media such as animation and movies and he has been played by actors such as Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Tom Holland, among others. \"Spider-Man\" (2002), \"Spider-Man 2\", \"Spider-Man 3\", \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", ', and '.\nTobey maguire and Andrew Garfield are confirmed in the new movie!!!\nPublication.\nThe first time that Spider-Man (who is also known as) Peter Parker appeared was in the \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 comic book in August 1962. Because of its success, a new comic book series began called \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Others were created including \"Spectacular Spider-Man\", \"Sensational Spider-Man\" and \"Ultimate Spider-Man\".\nAppearance.\nSpider-Man wears a red and blue super suit. This has a webbing design on the red parts of the suit which are the mask, torso, boots and gloves. The leggings and sleeves are blue.\nFictional character biography.\nIn Peter Parker's first appearance, he is introduced as an orphaned science whiz teenager living with his aunt and uncle in the Forest Hills section of New York City. He is a brilliant student but also gets picked on by his peers who accuse him of being a bookworm, and constantly gets bullied by Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson, who calls him \"Puny Parker\" and humiliates him daily. One day, he is bitten by a radioactive spider which then gives him his powers that turn him to Spider-Man.\nAs Spider-Man, he then becomes a successful TV star. The career then goes to his head that one day at a studio he refuses to stop a thief, saying that it is the job of the police, not that of a star. He then returns home to learn that his beloved Uncle Ben, has been murdered and as Spider-Man he angrily sets off to capture the killer. When he does, he is horrified to find that the man is none other than the Burglar he refused to subdue. Learning that with great power comes great responsibility, Spider-Man becomes a vigilante. After his uncle died, Peter and his aunt become desperate for money, so he gets a job as a photographer at the \"Daily Bugle\" selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson, who seems to be jealous of Spider-Man and makes Spider-Man look bad in the paper. As he battles many enemies for his first time, Parker finds it difficult juggling both his personal life and costumed adventures at the same time. In time, he would then graduate from high school, and enroll at Empire State University, where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and his second girlfriend (having been romantically involved with Betty Brant before) Gwen Stacy, Peter also discovers his best friend Harry has a drug problem and that Harry's father is revealed to be one of Spider-Man's nemeses the Green Goblin, Peter then attempts to give up his costumed identity. In the course of his adventures though Spider-Man has made quite a few of friends and contacts within the superhero community, who often come to his aid when he faces problems that he cannot solve on his own.\nHis loved ones are frequently endangered by enemies including a Spider-Man costume which turns out to be an alien symbiote. After noticing the symbiote's true nature Peter then rejects the symbiote after a difficult struggle. In a controversial storyline, Peter becomes convinced that Ben Reilly, the Scarlet Spider who is actually a clone of Peter created by his college professor Miles Warren is the real Peter Parker, and that he, Peter, is actually the clone. Peter gives up the Spider-Man identity to Reilly for a while until Reilly is killed by the returning Green Goblin and revealed to be the clone after all. He for a little bit develops additional spider-like abilities including biological web-shooters, toxic stingers that extend from his forearms, the ability to stick individuals to his back, enhanced Spider-sense and night vision, and increased strength and speed. He even becomes a member of the New Avengers, and reveals his civilian identity to the world, which causes more problems such as Aunt May being shot. Due to his Aunt May almost dying, his marriage to Mary Jane and public unmasking are later erased due to a deal made with the demon Mephisto, resulting in several adjustments to the timeline, such as the resurrection of Harry Osborn and Spider-Man original powers. After months of just Peter knowing Spider-Man's identity he then unmasks himself to the New Avengers and the Fantastic Four.\nSpider-Man in pop culture.\nSpider-Man is one of the most well known superheroes ever created. He is normally considered to Marvel Comics' flagship character. His quote \"With great power comes great responsibility\" is one of the most popular superhero quotes ever used. He has also been adopted in other media such as television and video games and most popularly Sam Raimi's film trilogy which includes \"Spider-Man\", \"Spider-Man 2\", and \"Spider-Man 3\". \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" movies are also popular.\nTelevision.\nSpider-Man has appeared on television numerous times, in both live-action and animated television programs. In animation he has appeared in a 1967 television series named after him, he also appeared in \"Spidey Super Stories\" on \"The Electric Company\", he appeared as an guest star in a \"Spider-Woman\" animated series. There was also a 1981 animated series of him and then an animated series called \"Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends\" soon after. And then in the Marvel Animation Age in 1994 there was another series about him and there was a spin off of it called \"Spider-Man Unlimited\". After the Sam Raimi movies there was an animated series of Spider-Man in MTV called \"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series\" and in 2008 there is an animated series called \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\". It is also said that he will appear in \"The Super Hero Squad Show\". In live action there is \"Amazing Spider-Man\" and an tokatsu series of Spider-Man in Japan."}

The recorder was often used by musicians to sound like bird songs. Purcell, Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi all wrote music for the recorder. By the 1900s very few people played the recorder. They liked the flute and other instruments better than the recorder. These instruments are louder than the recorder and are better for playing difficult music.\nIn the 1900s more people started to learn the recorder again. One reason was that people wanted to play old music on old kinds of instruments. A second reason was that the recorder is a good instrument for children to learn about music.\nHistory.\nWhistles are very old instruments. People have found some whistles that were made in the Iron Age. A recorder is a type of whistle. It has holes for seven fingers and one thumb. It also has one end bigger than the other. The first recorders were made in the 1500s. Some remains of these have been found in Germany, the Netherlands and Greece.\nMany people played the recorder in Europe in the 1500s and 1600s. King Henry VIII of England had 76 recorders. William Shakespeare talks about recorders in his play \"Hamlet\" and John Milton talks about them in his poem \"Paradise Lost\". Recorders from that time are now called Renaissance recorders.\nIn the 1600s, the people who made recorders tried new ways to make them sound better. They also wanted them to play more difficult music. Recorders from this time are called Baroque recorders. They were thinner than Renaissance recorders. They were also made in several parts that fitted together. In the picture at the top of the page, one of the recorders is in three parts.\nFrom the second half of the 1700s, people preferred to play the flute and clarinet instead of the recorder. Flutes are good for playing music which has a large range of notes. Flutes are also better for playing music which needs many chromatic notes.\nModern period.\nIn the 1900s people wanted to play old music with old kinds of instrument. In England, Arnold Dolmetsch was one of the people who was famous for this. Other musicians also began to play the recorder at serious music concerts. Some of these people were Frans Br\u00fcggen, Hans-Martin Linde, Bernard Kranis and David Munrow. In modern times, people have written new music for the recorder. Some of these people are Paul Hindemith, Luciano Berio, John Tavener, Michael Tippett, Benjamin Britten, Leonard Bernstein, Gordon Jacob and Edmund Rubbra.\nThe recorder is sometimes used in popular music. The Beatles played the recorder in their song \"Fool on the Hill\" and the Rolling Stones used a recorder in \"Ruby Tuesday (song)\". \nPlastic recorders were invented in the 20th century. They are cheap and vary greatly in quality (that is often not related to the price) depending on the manufacturer. They are easy instruments to play simple music. Many elementary schools use plastic recorders to teach music to children.\nThe head joint of the recorder is used as a noise, rhythm and effect instrument, and as a toy musical instrument with children. Because the recorder head works like a whistle, it can be used as such. With a bit practice, it is easy to play all kind of rhythms. Effects are made by opening and covering the lower end of the head joint with the hand while blowing. Many players blow harder like \"normal\" recorder playing (like with a pea whistle), to get a very shrill and loud sound. Professor Agnes Dorwarth of the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Freiburg argues this is an attractive way to get children to play with part of the instrument, which can make playing the entire instrument more inviting.\nKinds of recorder.\nRecorders are made in different sizes. The lowest note of most recorders is either C or F. This is the note that is heard when the player covers all the finger holes and the thumb hole. The soprano recorder is the size of recorder which is usually played in schools, also known as a Descant. The lowest note of the soprano recorder is C. Some recorders are smaller than the soprano recorder but are not common. The alto recorder is bigger than the soprano recorder. Its lowest is F. The other main sizes are the tenor recorder (with lowest note C) and the bass (with lowest note F). Instruments larger than the bass are made but are not common. These include the Great Bass, Contrabass, Subgreatbass and Subcontrabass. Recorders higher than a soprano recorder include the Sopranino and Garklein recorders.\nRecorder groups.\nThe recorder is a very social instrument. Many people enjoy playing in small or large groups. Groups often play music that is written for several different sizes of recorder together. Often there is a separate musical part for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass recorders. This covers a wider range of notes, from high sounds to low, than any single instrument could play. Some music is written for a recorder duet (two instruments), trio (three), or quartet (four). These groups are called \"ensembles,\" from the French word for \"together.\" Some people play in recorder orchestras. These sometimes have 50 or 60 players with nine sizes of instrument."}

When there is too much snow on a mountain, some of the snow may fall, causing damage to things in its path. This is called an avalanche. People talk about avalanches because they may be dangerous to skiers and other people doing winter sports.\nLarge avalanches may carry stones, boulders and trees with them. They may bury people under them. If the people are not found rapidly enough by rescue teams they will die of suffocation (not getting enough air) or of hypothermia (freezing cold).\nThe chance of surviving an avalanche is as follows:\nEuropean avalanche risk table.\nIn Europe, the avalanche risk is widely rated on the following scale, which was adopted in April 1993 to replace the earlier non-standard national schemes. Descriptions were last updated in May 2003 to enhance uniformity pdf .\n[1] Stability:\n[2] additional load:\nGradient:\nAvalanche size:\nSurviving avalanches.\nSurviving avalanches is very difficult, as the snow rushes at a very fast rate and can bury anyone alive in seconds. However, the snow in an avalanche acts like a liquid when descending. Thus, the best way is to actually 'swim' a backstroke. This will help as the person will be able to keep his/her face up and breathe, and also not get submerged in the snow at the same time (the force of swimming backwards is in contrast and opposes the force of the snow coming in his/her direction, rather than the snow totally taking over). \nAnother way is to hold on to something immediately after an avalanche occurs. The item should be strong so it itself doesn't get drifted away by an avalanche, like a tree or large and heavy rock. "}

It is one of the Imperial units and U.S. customary units. The shortest way of writing the unit \"foot\" is by the abbreviation \"ft\" (or \"ft.\"), or by a prime symbol (\u00a0\u2032\u00a0).\nOne foot contains 12 inches. This is equal to 30.48\u00a0centimetres. It is called a foot, because it was originally based on the length of a foot.\nHistory.\nThe foot was a common unit of measurement throughout Europe. It often differed in length not only from country to country but from city to city. Because the length of a foot changed between person to person, measurements were not even consistent between two people, often requiring an average. Henry I of England was attributed to passing the law that the foot was to be as long as a person's own foot. This was one of the first times a standard unit of measurement was put into place.\nIn 1959, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom all signed a treaty known as the 'International Yard and Pound Agreement'. This standardised the avoirdupois weight and length of all nations. Those standards are still officially used in both the Imperial system and U.S customary units.\nUsage.\nRoad signs with height restrictions in the United States and the United Kingdom are in feet and inches. They are less commonly seen in Canada and Ireland. In the U.S. and the UK, people usually measure a person's height in feet and inches. If a person is \"five foot eleven\", this means that person is 5 feet and 11 inches, or about 180 centimeters. The height is written \"5\u2032 11\u2033\"\nMany people born before metrication in a number of Commonwealth nations still use feet and inches.

It is the national sport and is the most popular sport in Australia. The main league of Australian rules football is the Australian Football League.\nHistory.\nIn 1858, Tom Wills, a former student of the Rugby school and Cambridge College, created a set of football rules that were like a cross between rugby, soccer and Gaelic football. He made up the game for cricketers to keep in shape during the off-season (winter). Wills had help in making up the game from other people like his cousin H.C.A. Harrison, and W.J. Hammersly and J.B. Thompson.\nWills grew up with Indigenous Australians. He spoke the language of the people who lived near him and played with the children. It has been suggested that Australian Rules Football is based in part on \"Marn Grook\", an Aboriginal game with some similar rules to Australian Rules Football. Because the indigenous people Wills played with as a child would have played \"Marn Grook\", Wills would have been influenced by this game when creating the rules for Australian Rules Football.\nThe Melbourne Football Club was founded on 14 May 1859; the Melbourne Football Club is one of the oldest surviving football clubs in the world. A game of football was played between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar School. It was played over three days on an oval next to the present day Melbourne Cricket Ground, and the two schools have played an annual game ever since. This game became known as Melbourne Rules Football, one of many local varieties of football that existed at that time, another notable one being Sheffield Rules Football. Then following its decision to not join either the association rules (1863) or rugby rules (1871), it became known as Victorian Rules, although it closely resembled the two former rule sets. Then in the 1880s as rugby and association rules began to diverge in a much greater way, Victorian Rules which resembled the 1850s type of football that both rugby and the association had based their rules on remained much the same except for moving to oval fields from rectangular fields and eventually introducing more posts. After the sport became popular in other states, people started calling it \"Australian Rules\".\nThe Victorian Football League ( VFL ) was created in 1896. The next year, the first official games were played. The first clubs were Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda, and South Melbourne. In 1908, Richmond and University joined. University left after the 1914 season. In 1925, Footscray, Hawthorn and North Melbourne joined the VFL.\nYears later other teams joined in: \nIn 1990 the Victorian Football League was changed to the Australian Football League (AFL). Footscray changed its name to the Western Bulldogs in 1997. North Melbourne changed its name to the Kangaroos in 1999, but changed back in 2008.\nAbout.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Australia, with crowd attendances of 50-80,000 people common to normal home and away matches and capacity crowds of 100,000 people at the home of football the MCG during the finals and special matches. The record crowd still remains at 121,696, who watched that most history-making of all Grand Finals in 1970, between Carlton and Collingwood, where Carlton came from a 44-point deficit at half-time to win the game by implementing an entirely new system of play, handballing out of the backline, which changed the game forever, and marked the beginnings of the transition of the game from one of a 'territorial' base to 'possession football'.\nThere are 16 teams in the AFL . Each team has 22 players during game day with team lists of 40-45 players.During the game, each team has 18 players on the field, consisting of 6 forwards, 3 centres, 6 backmen, and 3 followers. The 4 remaining players are reserves three of which can be interchanged with any other player in the team as often as the coach wants. The forth can replace a player but the replaced player can not come back on to the field of play.\nEvery game consists of 4 quarters, being 20 minutes and overtime (stoppage time, time-keepers acting upon central umpire signals to determine how long). After every quarter the teams swap direction. The quarter is started when the umpire blows his whistle and bounces the ball in the middle of the field (similar to a basketball \"tip\")and opposing players try to tap or punch the ball to their team-mates.\nThe idea of the game is to kick more goals than the other team. At each end of the field are 4 poles. Players score points by kicking the ball between the poles. A goal is a kick between the centermost posts. It is worth 6 points. A \"Behind\" (worth 1 point) is a kick that goes between the outer posts. Players can bounce the ball and hit it with their hand (handball it) to other players . If a player catches a ball after the ball has been kicked in the air by another player, then this is a \"mark\" and the player cannot be tackled until he plays on.\nIt is the only \"football\" code where the major score can ONLY be scored with the foot.\nPresent Teams.\nPresent teams"}

His full name was \"Armand Jean du Plessis\". He was later created the Duke of Richelieu and duke of Fronsac.\nIn order to keep the diocese of Lu\u00e7on, Armand Jean needed to become a monk. He joined the Grande Chartreuse, the main monastery of the Carthusian order. This monastery is in the Is\u00e8re d\u00e9partement, near Grenoble. As a comparison, Lu\u00e7on is near La Roche-sur-Yon.\nHe was consecrated as a bishop in 1607. For this he obtained a dispensation of the pope; at age 21, he was too young to become a bishop. He later entered politics and became a Secretary of State in 1616. Richelieu soon rose in both the Church and the state. He became a cardinal in 1622. He became King Louis XIII's chief minister in 1624. He remained in office until his death in 1642; then Jules Cardinal Mazarin became chief minister.\nThe Cardinal de Richelieu was often known by the title of the King's \"Chief Minister\". As a result, he is sometimes said to be the world's first Prime Minister. He sought to consolidate royal power and crush domestic factions. By restraining the power of the nobility, he transformed France into a strongly centralized state. His chief foreign policy objective was to check the power of the Austro-Spanish Habsburg dynasty; although a Roman Catholic cardinal, he did not hesitate to make alliances with Protestant rulers. With these alliances, he tried to achieve this goal. His tenure was marked by the Thirty Years' War that engulfed Europe.\nAs an advocate for Samuel de Champlain and of the keeping of Quebec, he founded the Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s and saw the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye return Quebec to French rule under de Champlain, after the settlement had been captured by the Kirkes in 1629. This in part allowed the colony to eventually develop into the heartland of French-speaking culture in North America.\nRichelieu was also famous for his patronage of the arts; most notably, he founded the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, the learned society responsible for matters of the French language. Richelieu is also known by the sobriquet \"l'\u00c9minence rouge\" (\"the Red Eminence\"), from the red shade of a cardinal's vestments and the style \"eminence\" as a cardinal."}

Even though many have assimilated to Arab society, they have their own heritage that spans 3,000 years.\nTraditional genealogy.\nIn Islamic and Jewish tradition, Arabs are a Semitic people who trace their ancestry from Ishmael, a son of the ancient patriarch Abraham and Hagar. Medieval Arab genealogists separate the Arabs into two groups: the \"original Arabs\" of South Arabia, descending from Qahtan (identified with the biblical Joktan) and the \"Arabized Arabs\" (musta`ribah) of North Arabia, descending from Adnan who is descended from Ishmael.\nReligion.\nMost Arabs today follow the religion of Islam, whose greatest prophet is Muhammad. Christianity makes up the largest religious minority - most of the Christians that do consider themselves Arabs belong to the Greek Orthodox Church with smaller numbers of Roman Catholics.\nWhile Coptic and Maronite Catholic Christians are native Arabic-speakers, many reject the Arab pan-ethnicity, but are still considered Arab by outsider sources.\nThere are some small communities practicing Judaism and polytheism (the worship of many gods). Yazidis are sometimes counted as Arabs."}

A roller coaster is usually a small train. It has a number of carriages that travel on a track. This track has hills that go up and valleys that go down. Sometimes it has other features that will turn the train upside-down. The track can be made from wood or steel. Some roller coasters are made for children, so they do not travel very fast. Other roller coasters are made very tall and they travel very fast. Riders are generally held in place with a bar, a belt, or something similar.\nScientifically, a roller coaster works because of gravity, a force that pulls things down to the ground. Most roller coaster trains are pulled to the top of a hill on a chain. The train will slide down the track, which has a number of hills and valleys. As it slides downhill it goes faster, and it slows down when climbing.\nHistory.\nIn the United States, LaMarcus Adna Thompson patented the first roller coaster on January 20, 1865. He named his ride the \"Switchback Railway,\" and workers pulled the carriage to the top of the track. The first modern steel roller coaster was the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland. It opened in 1959.\nTypes of roller coasters.\nRoller coaster rails are made of wood or steel.\nSteel roller coasters can be separated into many more types. On a Wing Coaster riders sit on either side of a roller coaster track and nothing is above or below the riders.\nOn a flying roller coaster riders lie face down so they feel like they are flying. Cars hang below the track.\nOn a Floorless Coaster riders sit with no floor underneath them, so their feet can swing freely just above the track. \nSome roller coasters spin riders.\nBoth steel and wooden roller coasters can turn riders upside down. This is called an inversion. \nSon of Beast was the only wooden roller coaster to have an inversion. However the loop was removed after an incident and after another incident, the ride was torn down. In 2013, Hades 360 and Outlaw Run have inversions. The Smiler has the world record for the most inversions."}

The victims are usually people the serial killer does not know, and the killer commits his crimes to get a certain kind of excitement or other feeling. They usually have no practical motive such as robbery or revenge.\n\"Serial killer\" first became a commonly used phrase for this kind of killer in the 1970s. This was the result of the crimes of people like Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy. Jack the Ripper is thought by many to be one of the first serial killers that many people knew about, even though his victims were killed long before the phrase was invented.\nA serial killer's crimes are nearly always alike in some way. The killer may only attack a certain type of person, for instance women of a certain age or appearance (young or old, blonde or dark-haired). He may always use the same kind of weapon to kill his victims, or may treat them in a certain manner, such as tying them up with the same kind of rope or adhesive tape. Some serial killers have had very strange habits which leave evidence of their work at each crime; for instance Albert de Salvo, the Boston Strangler, would tie the cord with which he had strangled a woman around her neck in a special bow. To law enforcement officers a serial killer's habits are known as his signature, and they are always valuable leads in detecting who he is and capturing him.\nSome of the worst serial killers have been doctors. Harold Shipman, a British general practitioner, is thought to have killed up to 250 of his patients. John Bodkin Adams, also British, is thought to have killed 163 patients.

The most common reason is to clear the land to make farms and ranches. They also cut trees for firewood and lumber and to make room for cities. Deforestation destroys the habitat of many animals, leading to their death. The loss is more severe in so called primary forests, which are forests that have yet been untouched by humans. Deforestation also releases sequestered carbon. \nRestoring trees in deforested places is called reforesting.\nCauses of deforestation.\nLand has other uses besides growing trees. The biggest uses of land that was once forested are for farming and ranching. Some land is also used for roads and buildings, especially in urban areas. As the population grows, people need to remove more trees. They also use the wood from the trees as lumber to make buildings and other things, or they burn the trees as firewood.\nForests have the following functions:\nForests are often planted to protect against natural disasters. When forests are lost, very often the soil they protected is also lost. This loss of soil is called erosion. \nTrees are also important for carbon sequestration. When the trees burn or rot, the carbon in them returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, deforestation causes global warming. Tropical deforestation is responsible for about 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn 2020, a team of scientists studied worldwide deforestation efforts and found they were not working. They said the idea of everyone working toward the same goal had to change because different groups of people had different reasons for cutting down forests."}

The tank is a large metal cylinder made of steel or aluminum.\nThe word scuba is an acronym from Underwater Breathing Apparatus.\nHistory.\nIn the 1600s, a diving bell would be lowered that had trapped air in it. A diving bell is like a large heavy upside-down bucket that holds air inside when lowered into the water. A diver would breathe that air and swim in an and out of the bell to work until the air became bad. Later fresh air was pumped to the diving bell through a hose, so the diver could stay longer.\nThe first diving suits used a heavy copper diving helmet with windows and a hose from an air pump. The helmet was clamped to a waterptoof diving suit. Divers would wear heavy weghts and walk on the seafloor as it was not safe to swim. The air hose would send air to the helmet from a pump on land or on a boat above the diver. The air would pass trough the helmet and out into the water through a valve, and the diver would breathe from the air in the helmet. This wasted a lot of air, but there was no way to only supply air when the diver needed it. This is called a free-flow system.\nJacques Cousteau was a Frenchman who developed several important parts of the scuba system and made it useful. One part was a better regulator that only sent air when the diver breathed in. This let the divers go farther on one tank. It was made with a mouthpiece on a rubber hose, so a heavy helmet was not needed. It was light enough to use with fins and easily swim. He also took many underwater movies and showed people what was under the water and why it needed to be protected.\nThere have been improvements to scuba equipment since Cousteau to make it safer and easier to use.\nCertification.\nDivers face dangers that can hurt or kill them if they don't know what to do. They can use up all their air, or get decompression sickness or nitrogen narcosis. A person must be trained to use the equipment and dive safely. When they show that they can dive safely they get a certification card. The biggest organization for certifying divers is PADI - Professional Association of Diving Instructors - but there are many others, depending on the country. Some tourist places have a short course without certification and then the instructor will lead the diver in a shallow dive, all in one day.\nBecause of special dangers, there are advanced classes for things like diving in or around underwater shipwrecks, cave diving, and deep diving (more than 60 feet or 18 meters)."}

It does not have the muscular/elastic tissue of other blood vessels. It has a single celled wall to help substances be transported through organisms.\nCapillaries are small, and smaller than any other blood vessels. They are about 5-10 \u03bcms big, which connect arteries and venules, and enable the moving of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, as well as many other nutrients and waste chemicals between blood and surrounding tissues.\nAnatomy.\nBlood moves from the heart to arteries, which branch and narrow into smaller arteries, and then branch more into capillaries. After oxygen has been moved to the tissue, capillaries join and widen to become small veins and then widen more to become veins, which return blood to the heart.\nThe \"capillary bed\" is the network of capillaries supplying an organ. The more metabolically active the cells, the more capillaries it will require to supply nutrients and carry away waste products. \nSpecial arteries connect between arterioles and venules and are important in bypassing the flow of blood through the capillaries. True capillaries come from mainly from metarterioles and provide movement between cells and the circulation. The width of 8 \u03bcm forces the red blood cells to partly fold into bullet-like shapes in order to bypass them in single file.\nPrecapillary muscles are rings of smooth muscles at the start of true capillaries that handle blood flow into true capillaries and control blood flow through a body part or area.\nPhysiology.\nThe capillary wall is a one-layer tissue so thin that gas and other items such as oxygen, water, proteins and fats can pass through them driven by pressure differences. Waste items such as carbon dioxide and urea can move back into the blood to be carried away for removal from the body. \nThe capillary bed usually moves no more than 25% of the amount of blood it could contain, although this amount can be increased through auto regulation by making the smooth muscle relax in the arterioles that lead to the capillary bed as well as metarterioles making themselves smaller.\nThe capillaries do not have this smooth muscle in their own wall, and so any change in their width is passive. Any signaling molecules they release (such as endothelin for constriction and nitric oxide for dilation) act on the smooth muscle cells in the walls of nearby, larger vessels, e.g. arterioles.\nCapillary's ability to move items can be increased by the release of certain cytokines, such as in an the body defending itself from germs."}

Most of them are marine. They have huge numbers in-shore, that is, in shallow water. They are the largest marine phylum, with about 85,000 living species, 23% of all named marine organisms. They also occur in freshwater and on land.\nMollusks are extremely varied: they have great diversity. That may be why there is no word in English for the phylum as a whole. \"In an evolutionary sense, mollusks are plastic material\". They have much more variety than their ancient rivals, the brachiopods.\nMost molluscs have shells, but some groups do not: octopods, slugs, and the gastropods known as sea slugs.\nDiversity.\nMany mollusks also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat.\nThe phylum is usually divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebrates: they have good brains and complex behaviours. Either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. The scientific study of mollusks is called malacology.\nMain features.\nThe three most universal features defining modern mollusks are:\nOther than these things, mollusks have so much variety that many textbooks use a \"hypothetical ancestral mollusk\" to summarize them (see below). This has a single, \"limpet-like\" shell on top, which is made of proteins and chitin reinforced with calcium carbonate. It is secreted by a mantle covering the whole upper surface. The underside of the animal consists of a single muscular \"foot\".\nThe mollusk's feeding system starts with a rasping \"tongue\", the radula. The complex digestive system uses mucus and microscopic, muscle-powered \"hairs\" called cilia. The generalized mollusk has two paired nerve cords, or three in bivalves. The brain, in species that have one, circles the oesophagus. Most mollusks have eyes, and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan reproductive system relies on external fertilization, but more complex variations occur. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults.\nA striking feature of molluscs is the use of the same organ for multiple functions. For example, the heart and nephridia (\"kidneys\") are important parts of the reproductive system, as well as the circulatory and excretory systems. In bivalves, the gills both \"breathe\" and produce a water current in the mantle cavity: this is important for excretion and reproduction. In reproduction, molluscs may change gender to accommodate the other breeding partner.\nGood evidence exists for the appearance of gastropods, cephalopods and bivalves in the Cambrian period, 541 to 485.4 million years ago (mya). Before that, the evolutionary history of molluscs' emergence from the ancestral Lophotrochozoa is still unclear.\nMollusk species can also represent hazards or pests for human activities. The bite of the blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of \"Octopus apollyon\" causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill: their venom have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200\u00a0million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.\nA \"generalized mollusk\".\nBecause mollusks have so many different shapes, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an \"archi-mollusc\", \"hypothetical generalized mollusc\", or \"hypothetical ancestral mollusc\" (\"HAM\") to illustrate the most common features in the phylum. The picture is rather similar to modern monoplacophorans: some think it may resemble very early mollusks.\nThe generalized mollusk is bilaterally symmetrical and has a single, \"limpet-like\" shell on top. The shell is secreted by a mantle covering the upper surface. The underside consists of a single muscular \"foot\". The visceral mass, or visceropallium, is the soft, nonmuscular metabolic region of the mollusc. It contains the body organs.\nTaxonomy.\nClasses of molluscs:\nHelcionelloida.\nIt has become clear that the fossil taxon Helcionelloida does \"not\" belong to the class Gastropoda. It is now a separate class in the Mollusca. Parkhaev (2006, 2007) created the class Helcionelloida, whose members were previously treated as \"Paleozoic mollusks of uncertain systematic position\" by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi."}

It is a simple animal with many cells, but no mouth, muscles, heart or brain. It is sessile: it cannot move from place to place the way most animals can. A sponge is an animal that grows in one spot like most plants do. Nevertheless, sponges are quite successful.\nThe basic body plan is a jelly-like layer sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. Their bodies are full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them. Most of them feed on bacteria and other microorganisms. A few of them eat tiny crustaceans.\nThere are more than 10,000 species of sponge. Most sponges live in the ocean. A few live in fresh water. All sponges take in water through pores (little holes) in their bodies. The water goes out through a big tube in the center. Most sponges filter (take out) little bits of food from the water going through their bodies. Animals that get food this way are called filter feeders.\nSponges are the oldest animals with fossil evidence (from ~635 million years ago).\nWhat makes them different.\nSponges are simple animals. A few things make them different from other animals. \nDifferent kinds of sponges.\nThere are four classes of sponges. The difference between these kinds is in how their skeleton is made.\nLife functions.\nMovement.\nSponges are sessile, they live in one place, where they are \"fixed\" to the ground. A few sponges can change their position, they can move at speeds of between 1\u00a0mm and 4\u00a0mm a day. They do this like amoebae. A few species can contract their whole bodies. Many can close their openings/holes.\nCarnivorous sponges.\nA few species live in waters where there is very little food available. They have therefore changed, and became predators. They eat small crustaceans and other small animals. Most of these sponges belong to the family Cladorhizidae, but a few members of the Guitarridae and Esperiopsidae are also carnivores. In most cases little is known about how they actually capture prey. Some species are thought to use either sticky threads or hooked spicules. Most carnivorous sponges live in deep waters, up to , and the development of deep-ocean exploration techniques is expected to lead to the discovery of several more. However one species has been found in Mediterranean caves at depths of 17-23m alongside the more usual filter feeding sponges. The cave-dwelling predators capture crustaceans under long by entangling them with fine threads, digest them by enveloping them with further threads over the course of a few days, and then return to their normal shape; there is no evidence that they use venom.\nMost known carnivorous sponges have completely lost the water flow system and choanocytes. However the genus \"Chondrocladia\" uses a highly modified water flow system to inflate balloon-like structures that are used for capturing prey.\nReproduction in Sponges.\nAsexual reproduction.\nSponges usually reproduce when little pieces break off. If such a piece has the right types of cells it can grow to become a new sponge. A few sponges can also use budding. With budding a small sponge grows on the parent; when it is done growing, it simply \"falls off\". When the conditions are bad, some sponges can also grow lumps of unspecialised cells. These will not develop until the conditions improve again. They can then either make a new sponge, or they can use the skeleton of the parent sponge (that died).\nSexual reproduction.\nMost sponges reproduce sexually. They can make sperm cells that are released into the water. These are either captured by another sponge, and are then transported to the egg cells of the parent. This is known as \"viviparous\". Both cells are joined to form larvae, which can swim off to find a good place to settle.\nThe other way, known as \"oviparous\" is that both sperm cells and egg cells are released into the water. These then combine outside the sponges.\nUse as tools.\nBy dolphins.\nA report in 1997 described how bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay used sponges as tools: A dolphin may attach a marine sponge to its rostrum (snoutlike projection). It is thought the sponge is used to protect the rostrum when the dolphin is looking for food in the sandy sea bottom but scientists have not confirmed this. The behaviour, known as \"sponging\", has only been seen in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behaviour to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related. This suggests that it is a fairly recent innovation. Dolphins also use sponges as an exfoliator, rubbing their skin against the sponge attached to the rock to get rid of their old/dry skin.\nBy people.\nThe calcium carbonate or silica spicules of most sponges make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, \"Hippospongia\" and \"Spongia\", have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until synthetic sponges were invented, they were also used as cleaning tools, for painting, and as contraceptives. In the 20th century, overfishing is a problem. This has caused the animals, as well as the industry behind it to be close to extinction.\nMany objects with sponge-like textures are now made of substances that do not come from poriferans. Synthetic \"sponges\" include personal and household cleaning tools; breast implants; contraceptive sponges.\nThe luffa \"sponge\", also spelled \"loofah\", which is commonly sold for use in the kitchen or the bath, is not derived from an animal but from the fibrous \"skeleton\" of a gourd (Cucurbitaceae)."}

{"id": "22811", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22811", "title": "Braille", "text": "The Braille system is a way of writing things. It is named after Louis Braille, the French man who invented it. The system is used by blind people to read and write. The Braille system uses a set of raised bumps or dots that can be felt with a finger. Each set of dots is a character in an alphabet, and the numbers and some punctuation.\nBefore Braille.\nLouis Braille was not the first person to think about how to let the blind read and write. In the 17th century the Italian Jesuit Francesco Lana thought about different systems of writing for the blind. He invented a system of dashes that could be felt.\nValentin Ha\u00fcy was one of the first French who was interested in the problems the blind had when they wanted to communicate. Ha\u00fcy was born in Picardie in 1745, and studied languages at the university in Paris. First he studied deaf people who could not speak, then blind people. In his opinion the biggest problem of the blind was that they could not read. He then invented a system which allowed them to read and write sentences and to do mathematics. Later he started a school for blind children. His writing system used two columns which had between one and six positions each. Vowels had a dot in the left column, for example.\nCharles Barbier used a similar system, because Napoleon wanted a code that soldiers could use to exchange messages silently and without light at night. Barbier called it night writing. Night writing uses two columns of six dots. It uses phonemes (separate sounds), not letters. Barbier's system was too hard for soldiers to learn, and the military did not use it. From the year 1821, he started to test his system in the school Ha\u00fcy had founded. There it became very successful. Even though the system was difficult to learn, it did help the blind to read better than earlier systems. Barbier had understood that it was better to use a system that used dots over one that used lines.\nBarbier met Braille when he visited the National Institute of the Blind. Braille saw the biggest problem of the code: The human finger cannot feel the whole symbol at one time. This makes it impossible to move rapidly from one symbol to the next. Braille's change was to use a 6 dot cell \u2014 the braille system \u2014 which completely changed how the blind would read and write.\nThe Braille alphabet.\nBraille can be seen as the world's first binary way of character encoding. The system as originally invented by Braille has two parts\nBraille is used with different languages today. In each language, the letters are \"encoded\" differently, depending on the alphabet. The list of codes is known as braille code, or code page. There are also different braille codes in use for special purposes, like writing shorthand, mathematics or music.\nTo make it possible to read faster, certain transcriptions of Braille use shortened words, or contractions. This is known as \"Grade 2 Braille\".\nThe Braille cell.\nBraille uses cells of six raised dots, in two columns of three dots. The dot positions on the left are numbered one, to three, the ones on the right four to six, as shown in the picture.\nEach symbol is coded with certain dots present, and others absent. The dots are approximately 0.02\u00a0inches (0.5\u00a0mm) high; inside the cell, the dots are about 0.1\u00a0inches (2.5\u00a0mm) apart. The space between the dots of two cells is about 0.15\u00a0inches (3.75\u00a0mm) horizontally and 0.2\u00a0inches (5\u00a0mm) vertically. A standard braille page is 11\u00a0inches by 11\u00a0inches and typically has between forty and forty-two braille cells per line and twenty-five lines.\nEncoding.\nAs first made by Louis Braille, the first group of characters, using just the top 4 dots of the braille cell, represents letters \"a\" through \"j\" (this group of ten characters is called a \"decade\"). Dot 3 (bottom left) is added to each of the \"a\" through \"j\" symbols to give letters \"k\" through \"t\". Both of the bottom dots (dots 3 and 6) are added to the first decade to give letters \"u\", \"v\", \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\". The letter \"w\" is left out of this group because French did not use the letter \"w\" when Louis Braille made his alphabet. The fifth decade is the same as the first decade, but shifted down by a row (dots 1 and 4 are blank).\nEnglish braille has codes for the letters and some punctuation, and some double letter signs and word signs directly, but capitalization and numbers need a prefix symbol. In practice, braille produced in the United Kingdom does not use capital letters.\nThere are braille codes for representing shorthand (produced on a machine which embosses a paper tape) and for representing mathematics (Nemeth Braille) and musical notation (braille music).\nWriting braille.\nBraille can be made using a \"slate\" and a \"stylus\" in which each dot is created from the back of the page, writing in mirror image, by hand, or it may be produced on a special braille typewriter or \"Perkins Brailler\", or produced by a braille embosser attached to a computer. It may also be made using a refreshable braille display.\nExtensions.\nThe six bit braille code is very limited, it only allows 64 different possible combinations. This means that many things need more than one braille character to be coded. One example for this is how numbers are coded in English braille: First there is a symbol that says the next symbol is a number, and then there is the symbol for the number. The symbol for \"number\" is usually given only once; every symbol that follows is treated as a number, until there is a space.\nBraille has been extended to an 8 dot code, particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays. In 8 dot braille the added dots are added at the bottom of the cell, giving a cell 4 dots high by 2 dots wide. The additional dots are called 7 (for the lower-left dot) and 8 (for the lower-right dot). 8-dot braille has the advantages that capital and lower cases of the letters are directly coded in the cell, a capital letter does not need two cells. All the printable ASCII characters can be represented in a single cell, and all 256 possible combinations of 8 bits are encoded by the Unicode standard. Braille with six dots is frequently stored as braille ASCII.\nBraille transcription.\nGrade 1 braille.\nIt is possible to transcribe braille by replacing each letter with the braille code for the letter. This is usually known as \"Grade 1 Braille\". Grade 1 braille is mostly used by beginners.\nThe basic problem of Grade 1 braille is that braille \"letters\" are much larger than printed ones. The standard page is 11\"x11\" (28\u00a0cm by 28\u00a0cm) in size and only has room for twenty-five lines of forty characters. This means a book would need to be very thick compared to a standard printed book.\nGrade 2 braille.\nFor this reason almost all English braille books use a transcription known as \"Grade 2 braille\". Grade 2 braille uses contractions, which allows to save space and increase reading speed. Grade 2 braille was developed by linguists (people who study languages), who also looked at customs, styles and practices. Transcribing a text into Grade 2 braille is difficult, and the people doing the transcription need to have a special education.\nIn English, there are 23 words which are replaced with a single letter. That way, the word \"but\" is contracted (shortened) to the single letter \"b,\" \"can\" to \"c\", \"do\" to \"d\", and so on. Even this simple rule has exceptions and special cases, which must be thought of. As an example, only the verb \"to do\" is replaced by \"d\", the noun \"do\" (which stands for a note in music) is a different word, and is written in full.\nSometimes, part of words are contracted, and a character can mean different things in different parts of a word. There are many rules for this process. For example, the character with dots 2-3-5 (the letter \"f\" lowered in the braille cell) stands for \"ff\" when used in the middle of a word. At the beginning of a word, this same character stands for the word \"to\" although the character is written in braille with no space following it. At the end of a word, the same character represents an exclamation point.\nThe contraction rules cannot be used when it would make a problem with a prefix or suffix on the word. Also, some rules are flexible and may depend on the situation. So when the rules permit the same word to be written in more than one way, preference is given to \"the contraction that is closer to the correct pronunciation.\"\nGrade 3 braille.\n\"Grade 3 Braille\" is a system that includes many additional contractions. It is almost like a shorthand. It is rarely used for books, but people use it to be able to write and read fast, for themselves. It can be used for taking notes.\nGrade 4 braille.\nOnly very few people can use grade 4 braille. It uses many rules to shorten grade 3 even further. It allows a blind person to use shorthand to follow spoken conversation. Very often, systems of seven or eight dots are used.\nBraille on banknotes.\nThe current Canadian paper money has raised dots on the bills that shows its value. This helps blind people who might otherwise be cheated. This 'tactile feature' does not use standard braille but, instead, a system developed by working with blind and visually impaired Canadians after they found that not all people who needed it could read braille.\nWriting systems other than Braille.\nBraille may not be the main way blind people read and write. In Britain (for example), of the two million visually impaired people, \"only about 15-20 thousand use Braille\". In the U.S.A. according to the 2015 \"Annual Report\" from the American Printing House for the Blind, there were 61,739 legally blind students registered in the U.S. Of these, only \"8.6% (5,333) were registered as braille readers\", 31% (19,109) as visual readers, 9.4% (5,795) as auditory readers, 17% (10,470) as pre-readers, and 34% (21,032) as non-readers. \nCurrently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are Braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know Braille, only 33% are employed.\nYounger people are turning to electronic text on computers which can be read aloud by software programs. This is a good communication method they can use with their friends. Inevitably, software will go on advancing, as it does in all its functions. Also, there are audio sources for literature: some are available for use without computer links. Much thought is going into all these issues. \nA term which is useful to know is \"accessible publishing\": Accessible publishing means books and other texts are available in formats designed to aid or replace the reading process. Examples are: varieties of larger fonts, specialised fonts for certain kinds of reading disabilities, Braille, e-books, and automated Audiobooks and digital talking books. This means that Braille is only one way for sighting-impaired people to go; also that there are many more partially sighted people than registered blind people. The partially sighted obviously have more choices.\nBraille for other scripts.\nThere are many extensions of Braille for additional letters with diacritics, such as \"\u00e7, \u00f4, \u00e9\".\nWhen braille is adapted to languages which do not use the Latin alphabet, the blocks are generally assigned to the new alphabet according to how it is transliterated into the Latin alphabet, not the alphabetic order of the national script. This is the case with Russian (Cyrillic alphabet), Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chinese. In Greek, for example, \"gamma\" is written as Latin \"g\", even though it is the third letter of that alphabet (like the Latin \"c\"). Hebrew \"beth\", the second letter of the alphabet and cognate with the Latin letter \"b\", is instead written \"v\", as it is commonly pronounced. Esperanto letters with circumflexes, \"\u0109\", \"\u011d\", \"\u0125\", \"\u0135\" and \"\u015d\", are written as those letters without circumflexes with a filled sixth dot.\nMore differences are in Chinese braille. In Mandarin Braille, which is based on Zhuyin rather than the Latin Pinyin alphabet, the Latin braille values are used for the first consonants and the simple vowels. There are additional blocks for the tones, diphthongs, and any following vowel + consonant combinations. Cantonese Braille is also based on Latin braille for many of the initial consonants and simple vowels, but the blocks also have different values depending on whether they are in a leading syllable or following syllable position. For instance, the block for Latin \"k\" represents old-style Cantonese \"k\" (\"g\" in Yale and other modern Romanizations) when initial, but \"aak\" when final, while Latin \"j\" represents Cantonese initial \"j\" but final \"oei\".\nHowever, at least two adaptations of Braille have completely reassigned the Latin sound values of the blocks. These are:\nIn Japanese Braille, alphabetic signs for a consonant and vowel are combined into a single syllable block; in Korean Braille, the consonants have different leading and following syllable forms. These changes made Braille much more compatible with Japanese kana and Korean hangul, but meant that the Latin sound values could not be kept.\nReading Braille.\nTrained readers of Braille can read about 100 words per minute; trained readers who do not have sight problems can get to around 250 to 300 words per minute."}

He has been described as one of the greatest thinkers ever whose ideas have changed the way people think.\nLife.\nHe was born in London, the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, and the nephew of Queen Elizabeth's advisor, William Cecil. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first job was as a lawyer. He later became a Member of Parliament and in 1586 he took a leading part in having Mary Queen of Scots executed. He became a friend of Robert Deveraux, the Earl of Essex, in 1591, and received many valuable gifts from him. After Essex led a rebellion against the Queen, Bacon was one of the people who led the investigation which led to Essex's execution in 1601.\nBacon was often in trouble for spending too much, and in 1601 he was arrested for debt. When King James became king in 1603, Bacon's position improved. He was knighted in 1603. He was one of the people who argued for the joining of England and Scotland together as one country, which happened after his lifetime, in the 1700s. Bacon married Alice Barnham in 1606, and the next year he was made the Solicitor General. He continued to be given better paying positions including Attorney General, Lord Keeper, and Lord Chancellor.\nHe was made Baron Verulam in 1618, and Viscount St Albans in 1621. Because he did not have children both titles ended when he died.\nHe used his positions to make more money for himself, and in 1621 the Parliament found that he was corrupt. He was fined \u00a340,000 and removed from all his jobs. King James overturned the fine, but he was kept as a prisoner in the Tower of London for a while.\nStudies.\nHe became best known as a leading thinker in new ways of looking at the world. His writings started and made famous a way of thinking about science. This way of thinking is now called the \"Baconian method\". It is based on looking at the world by making experiments. After watching the results the scientist comes up with an idea to explain what has happened. This idea or hypothesis is then further tested by more experiments. This way of thinking about science is called inductive methodology. In Bacon's time these methods were linked with magic including hermeticism and alchemy. Alchemy was the study of fire, earth, water and air. Alchemists tried to make gold from lead."}

A case of serious vascular injury from tear gas shells has also been reported from Iran, with high rates of associated nerve injury (44%) and amputation (17%), as well as instances of head injuries in young people. Directly exposing skin to tear gas may lead to chemical burns and allergic reactions of the skin.\nIn the short term, the medical consequences are usually limited to skin inflammation. delayed complications are also possible: people with respiratory conditions such as asthma are likely to need medical attention and may sometimes require hospitalization or even ventilation support. Skin exposure to CS may cause chemical burns or induce allergic contact dermatitis.

It was also the capital city until 2006. The city is by a river called Hlaingthayar, and is close to the sea. Yangon has more than 4 million people living there.\nHistory.\nYangon was founded as Dagon in the 6th century AD by the Mons, who ruled Lower Burma at that time. Dagon was a small fishing village centered about the Shwedagon Pagoda. In 1755, King Alaungpaya conquered Dagon and renamed it \"Yangon\". The British captured Yangon during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824\u201326) but returned it to Burma after the war. The city was destroyed by a fire in 1841.\nThe British took Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, and then changed Yangon into the most important city of British Burma. The British constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land. It was bound to the east by the Pazundaung Creek and to the south and west by the Yangon River. Yangon became the capital of all British Burma after the British had captured Upper Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885. By the 1890s Yangon's increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential suburbs to the north of Royal Lake (Kandawgyi) and Inya Lake. The British also established hospitals including Rangoon General Hospital and colleges including Rangoon University.\nColonial Yangon, with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture, was known as \"the garden city of the East.\" By the early 20th century, Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London.\nBefore World War II, about 55% of Yangon's population of 500,000 was Indian or South Asian, and only about a third was Bamar (Burman). Karens, the Chinese, the Anglo-Burmese and others made up the rest.\nAfter World War I, Yangon became the center of Burmese independence movement. The leftist Rangoon University students led the way. Three nationwide strikes against the British Empire in 1920, 1936 and 1938 began in Yangon. Yangon was under Japan's occupation (1942\u201345), and was heavily damaged during World War II. Yangon became the capital of Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 when the country regained independence from the British Empire."}

He is best known for the Pulitzer Prizes, which were started after his death by his will.\nHe is also known, long with William Randolph Hearst, for starting yellow journalism as a way to sell more papers by printing sensationalism in articles.\nEarly days: \"The Post-Dispatch\".\nJoseph Pulitzer was born in Mak\u00f3, in present-day Hungary. Originally, he wanted to do a military career, but was turned down by the Austrian army. They said his health was bad and that he did not see very well. He went to live in the United States in 1864 to serve the Union in the American Civil War. After the war he settled in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1868 he began working there for a German-language daily newspaper, the \"Westliche Post\". He joined the Republican Party and was elected to the Missouri State Assembly in 1869. In 1872, Pulitzer bought the \"Post\" for $3,000. Then, in 1878, he bought the \"St. Louis Dispatch\" for $2,700 and merged the two papers, which became the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", which remains St. Louis' daily newspaper. It was at the Post-Dispatch that Pulitzer developed his role as a champion of the common man with expos\u00e9s and a hard-hitting populist approach.\n\"The New York World\".\nBy 1883, Pulitzer had made a lot of money. In that year, he bought the \"New York World\". That newspaper had been losing $40,000 a year. He paid $346,000 to Jay Gould, the owner. Pulitzer changed its focus to human-interest stories, scandal, and sensationalism. In 1885, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, but resigned after a few months' service. He did not like politics. In 1887, he recruited the famous investigative journalist Nellie Bly. In 1895 the \"World\" introduced the popular Yellow Kid comic by Richard F. Outcault. This was the first newspaper comic printed with color. Under Pulitzer's leadership, circulation grew from 15,000 to 600,000, making \"The New York World\" the largest newspaper in the nation.\nHealth problems.\nThe editor of the rival \"New York Sun\" attacked Pulitzer in print. He called him \"The Jew who gave up his religion\". This was in 1890. This was intended to turn away Pulitzer's Jewish readership. Pulitzer's already failing health deteriorated rapidly, and he left the newsroom. He continued to actively manage the paper from his vacation retreat in Bar Harbor, Maine and his New York mansion.\nIn 1895, William Randolph Hearst purchased the rival \"New York Journal\", which led to a circulation war. This competition with Hearst, particularly the coverage before and during the Spanish-American War, linked Pulitzer's name with \"yellow journalism\".\nAfter the \"World\" exposed a fraudulent payment of $40 million by the United States to the French Panama Canal Company in 1909, Pulitzer was indicted for libeling Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan. The courts dismissed the indictments, in a victory for freedom of the press.\nTries to set up a school for journalism.\nIn 1892, Pulitzer offered Columbia University's president, Seth Low, money to set up the world's first school of journalism. The university initially turned down the money, evidently unimpressed by Pulitzer's unscrupulous character. In 1902, Columbia's new president Nicholas Murray Butler was more receptive to the plan for a school and prizes, but it would not be until after Pulitzer's death that this dream would be fulfilled. Pulitzer left the university $2 million in his will, which led to the creation in 1912 of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, but by then the first school of journalism had been created at the University of Missouri. Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism remains one of the most prestigious in the world.\nJoseph Pulitzer died aboard his yacht in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina in 1911. He is interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. In 1917, the first Pulitzer Prizes were awarded, in accordance with Pulitzer's wishes.\nIn 1989, Pulitzer was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame."}

They are a highly successful group of mainly terrestrial invertebrates: spiders, scorpions, harvestmen, ticks, and mites, and a number of smaller groups.\nIn 2019, a molecular phylogeny study put horseshoe crabs in the Arachnida.\nDefinition.\nArachnids are . The requirements for this class is to have two body regions; a cephalothorax and an abdomen; 4 pairs of legs; and 2 pairs of mouthpart appendages, the chelicerae and the pedipalps.\nAnatomy.\nAll adult arachnids have four pairs of legs, and arachnids may be easily distinguished from insects by this fact, since insects have three pairs of legs. However, arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages that have become adapted for feeding, defense, and sensory perception. The first pair, the chelicerae, serve in feeding and defense. The next pair of appendages, the pedipalps have been adapted for feeding, locomotion, and/or reproductive functions.\nLike all arthropods, arachnids have an exoskeleton. They also have an internal structure of cartilage-like tissue, to which certain muscle groups are attached.\nArachnids have no antennae or wings. Their body is organized into two parts: the cephalothorax, and the abdomen.\nPhysiology.\nThere are some adaptations for life on land. They have internal respiratory surfaces. These may be trachea (tubes), or a modification of gills into a 'book lung'. This is an internal series of lamellae used for gas exchange with the air.\nDiet and Digestive System.\nArachnids are mostly carnivorous, feeding on the pre-digested bodies of insects and other small animals. Only the harvestmen and some mites eat solid food particles. Predigestion avoids exposure to internal parasites. Several groups secrete venom from specialized glands to kill prey or enemies. Several mites are external parasites, and some of them are carriers of disease (vectors).\nArachnids pour digestive juices produced in their stomachs over their prey after killing it with their pedipalps and chelicerae. The digestive juices rapidly turn the prey into a broth of nutrients which the arachnid sucks into a pre-buccal cavity located immediately in front of the mouth. Behind the mouth is a muscular, pharynx, which acts as a pump, sucking the food through the mouth and on into the oesophagus and stomach. In some arachnids, the oesophagus also acts as an additional pump.\nMyth.\nThe word \"Arachnida\" comes from the Greek for 'spider'. In legend, a girl called Arachne was turned into a spider by the goddess Athena. Arachne said she'd win a weaving contest against the goddess. Athena won, but Arachne became angry, and started to weave an insult to the gods. Then Athena turned her into a spider for her disrespect.\nOrders.\nThe subdivisions of the arachnids are usually treated as orders. Historically, mites and ticks were treated as a single order, Acari. However, molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that the two groups do not form a single clade; morphological similarities are probably due to convergence. They are now usually treated as two separate taxa \u2013 Acariformes, mites, and Parasitiformes, ticks \u2013 which may be ranked as orders or superorders. The arachnid subdivisions are listed below alphabetically; numbers of species are approximate.\nIt is estimated that 98,000 arachnid species have been described, and that there may be up to 600,000 in total."}

Observe:\n1. formula_1\nIf \"B\" = 0, then \"C\" = 0. This is true. But:\n2. formula_2\nWhich is the same as:\n3. formula_3\nThe problem is that formula_4 could be any number. It would work if formula_4 were 1 or if it were 1,000,000,000. 0/0 is said to be of \"indeterminate form\" for this reason, because it has no single value. Numbers of the form A/0, on the other hand, where formula_4 is not 0, are said to be \"undefined\", or \"undeterminated.\" This is because any attempt to define them will result in a value of infinity, which is itself undefined. Usually when two numbers are equal to the same thing, they are equal to each other. That is not true when the thing they are both equal to is 0/0. This means that the normal rules of maths do not work when the number is divided by zero.\nIncorrect proofs based on division by zero.\nIt is possible to disguise a special case of division by zero in an algebraic argument. This can lead to invalid proofs, such as 1=2, as in the following:\nWith the following assumptions:\nThe following must be true:\nDividing by zero gives:\nSimplify:\nThe fallacy is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with 0/0 = 1.\nMost people would probably recognize the above \"proof\" as incorrect, but the same argument can be presented in a way that makes it harder to spot the error. For example, if 1 is written as \"x\", then 0 can be hidden behind \"x\"-\"x\" and 2 behind \"x\"+\"x\". The above-mentioned proof can then be displayed as follows:\ntherefore:\nDividing by \"x\" - \"x\" gives:\nand dividing by \"x\" gives:\nThe \"proof\" above is incorrect because it divides by zero when it divides by \"x\"-\"x\", because any number minus itself is zero.\nCalculus.\nIn calculus, the above \"indeterminate forms\" also come as a result of direct substitution while evaluating limits. \nDivision by zero in computers.\nIf a computer program tries to divide an integer by zero, the operating system will usually detect this and stop the program. Usually it will print an \"error message,\" or give the programmer advice on how to improve the program. Division by zero is a common bug in computer programming. Dividing floating point numbers (decimals) by zero will usually result in either infinity or a special NaN (not a number) value, depending on what is being divided by zero.\nDivision by zero in geometry.\nIn geometry formula_15 This infinity (projective infinity) is neither a positive or a negative number, the same way that zero is neither a positive or negative number"}

He transformed Russia from an isolated kingdom into a transcontinental superpower. \nHe became czar of Russia in 1682, after his sister Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia lost a war. In 1697 he visited Western Europe and decided Russia must have access to the sea. He built the city and seaport of St. Petersburg which became the capital of Russia in 1711. He changed Russia's society, by making new laws so it would be modern like the European countries of the new Age of Enlightenment. Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov was a close friend of the emperor but was later disgraced due to embezzlement of national funds.\nWars.\nThese are the wars that Russia fought in when Peter the Great was in charge:\nThe Great Turkish War: In this war Russia fought against the Ottoman Empire and won. Russia got some fortresses in the town of Azov from the Ottoman Empire.\nGreat Northern War: Russia was fighting Sweden during the Great Northern War. In 1700 Saxony, Denmark and Russia attacked Sweden. Sweden invaded Russia in 1709 which was not a good idea. The Russian Army retreated so the Swedish Army had to chase them. When a very cold winter came, half of the Swedish soldiers died in the cold. Eventually the Swedish army caught up to the Russian army and they had a battle, called the battle of Poltava. Russia won the battle but most of the Swedish soldiers, including their king, Charles XII of Sweden escaped and went to the Ottoman Empire. Peter didn't like this so he declared war on the Ottoman Empire but he lost and had to give the town of Azov back to the Ottomans.\nAfter that Russia invaded Sweden and conquered Estonia, Livonia, and Finland. By 1719 Russia had conquered all of Sweden. Even though Sweden had clearly lost, they did not give up until 1721. In 1721 Sweden signed the Treaty of Nystad where they agreed to give Estonia, Livonia and Ingria to Russia. \nBecause Russia was a major power after the war, Peter the Great changed its name from the Tsardom of Russia to the Russian Empire. \nRusso-Persian War: At the start of the war Persia was already in chaos and was about to collapse. Peter the Great took advantage of this and invaded Persia. The war went from 1722 to 1723. In the end, Russia won and gained lots of land from Persia but had lost a lot of men from fighting. After Peter died, his heirs struggled for power and all the lands that Russia had conquered were given back to Persia.\nReferences.\nNotes"}

{"id": "22971", "revid": "6895692", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22971", "title": "Musical note", "text": "In music, a note is a small bit of sound, similar to a syllable in spoken language. For example: in the first two lines of the song \"Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are\" there are 14 notes: one for each syllable.\nConfusingly, the word \"note\" can also mean the pitch of a note (how high or low it is). For example: the whole of the song \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" can be played using six different notes: C, D, E, F, G and A.\nThe word \"note\" can also mean the written symbol of the note.\nNearly all music is made up of notes. Music without notes might be sound effects.\nMusic.\nIn some Western countries, like United Kingdom, Germany and the USA, the notes (in the sense of the pitches) are given a letter of the alphabet according to their pitch. From lowest sounding to highest sounding: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. This pattern repeats, so that after G will come A. This A is an octave higher than the first A.\nBecause there are 12 notes needed in Western music, these 7 notes can have modifiers (\"symbols or words that change them\"). The two main modifiers are sharps, which raise the pitch a half-step, and flats, which lower the pitch a half-step. The symbol for a sharp is \u266f (like the hash symbol (American: number symbol): #). The symbol for a flat is \u266d (like a lower-case italic \"b\"). To un-flat or un-sharp a note, the natural symbol, \u266e, is written before the note. When writing in words (like this page), the symbols are written after the note name, for example: \"B\u266d\" means B flat and \"F\u266f\" represents F sharp. However, when writing in music notation, the flat, sharp or natural signs are written BEFORE the note. A way to remember this is to say: if the sign came after the note, it would be too late, and you would have already played it, so it must go before so that you know what is coming.\nSharps and flats can also be written in key signatures. A key signature is written at the beginning of the piece, and repeated at the beginning of each line. It gives the sharps or flats which are going to be regular in the piece.\nTwo other modifiers are double sharps, which raise the note a whole step, and double flats, which lower the note a whole step. These are much less common that the simple sharp or flat, but can still be seen in some types of music. The symbol for a double sharp is \u00d7 and the symbol for a double flat is \u266d\u266d. For example, E\u266d\u266d is another name for D. This is called an enharmonic equivalent. Another enharmonic equivalent is C and B\u266f.\nOther note names.\nIn some languages, such as the Romance languages (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian), notes are named Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si (\"or Ti\") instead of C, D, E, F, G, A, B. This notation is called solfege in the United States. These notes are the focus for a song in \"The Sound of Music\".\nDrum Kits do not have notes, they have places on the manuscript where each line means each Drum,\neach symbol means each Cymbak on the Kit - how Many Times to hit it in what speed and beats\nin a bar there are usually shown as 4/4 and you count 1 2 3 4 each bar."}

The pandemic spread to remote Pacific Islands and the Arctic. It killed 50 million to 100\u00a0million people\u2014 three\u00a0to five percent of the world's population at the time. This means it was one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history.\nTo maintain morale, wartime censors reduced reports of illness and mortality in Germany, Britain (United Kingdom), France, and the United States; but papers could report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII). This situation created the false impression of Spain being especially hard-hit. It also resulted in the nickname Spanish flu.\nOften, influenza outbreaks kill young people, or the elderly, or those patients that are already weakened. This was not the case for the 1918 pandemic, which killed mainly healthy young adults. Modern research, using virus taken from the bodies of frozen victims, has concluded that the virus kills through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). The strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body. But, the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults caused fewer deaths among those groups.\nThere is not enough historical and epidemiological data to show where the pandemic started. The pandemic may be a cause of the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s. Another flu pandemic had happened in the 21st century that turns out to be new strain of H1N1.

It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott and Alfred Molina. Ford portrays Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting archaeologist, vying with Nazi forces in 1936, to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant, a relic said to make an army invincible. Teaming up with his tough, former lover Marion Ravenwood (Allen), Jones races to stop rival archaeologist Dr. Ren\u00e9 Belloq (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.\nLucas conceived \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the movie's goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977 space opera \"\". Development on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" resumed that year when Lucas shared the idea with Spielberg; he joined the project several months later. While the pair had ideas for significant scenes in the movie, they hired Kasdan to fill in the gaps between them. Principal photography began in June 1980 on a $20 million budget. Filming took place on sets at Elstree Studios, England, and on location in La Rochelle, France, Tunisia, Hawaii and California.\nThough pre-release polling showed little audience interest in the movie, especially compared to the superhero film \"Superman II\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" became the highest-grossing movie of 1981, earning approximately $330.5 million worldwide. It played in some theaters for over a year because of its popularity. It was a critical success, receiving praise for its modern take on older serial movies, and its non-stop action and adventure. The cast were all praised, particularly Ford, Allen and Freeman. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" received numerous award nominations and among others, winning five Academy Awards, seven Saturn Awards and one BAFTA Award.\nIn the years since its release, the movie has grown in esteem, and many now consider it to be among the greatest movies of all time, one of the greatest movies of the 1980s, and one of the greatest action-adventure movies ever made. It had a significant impact on popular culture; the movie's success spawned a host of imitators across several media and inspired a variety of filmmakers. It continues to influence modern media. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is the first movie in what would become the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise, that includes three film sequels\u2014\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", and \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\"\u2014a television series, video games, comic books, novels, theme park attractions, toys, board games, collectibles and an amateur remake.

His guide, Sapito, betrays him and tries to take the idol for himself, but is killed in a trap. After Jones comes out from the temple, he finds his rival Belloq and a dozen of the native people holding spears. Jones gives up the idol and runs to his airplane.\nWhile he is teaching at Marshall College, the U.S. Army tells him the Nazis are trying to find the Ark of the Covenant. Jones wants to find it first, so he goes to a bar in Nepal. His old teacher, Abner Ravenwood, was trying to find the Ark and has the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, a piece that is needed to find the Ark. His daughter, Marion, now runs Abner's bar and she punches him in the face because they had a romance and he ran away. She, however, comes along with him after the Nazi Toht and his friends try to get the piece themselves.\nJones and Ravenwood fly to Cairo and recruit a man named Sallah to help him out. They start digging in the area where they think it is. The Nazis capture Ravenwood and makes Jones thinks that she is dead. Sallah and Jones do some calculations and realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong area because their staff is too long. Jones finds the right place and starts digging, finding it in a place called the Well of Souls. However, Belloq comes back, raises the Ark, and throws Ravenwood in there. They escape.\nAfter a battle, Jones gets the Ark back. Sallah puts it on a ship which sails across the Mediterranean Sea, but the Nazis on a U-boat intercept the ship and search it. Jones escapes. He then takes a big weapon called Panzerschreck and threatens to blow up the Ark as it is being loaded onto a Greek island north of Crete. Belloq calls Jones' bluff, and Jones lowers his weapon. He and Marion are then tied up as Belloq and the Nazis test the power of the Ark by opening it. The spirits inside kill everyone. Jones and Marion close their eyes and escape the spirits' anger.\nAt the end of the movie, the Army puts the Ark inside a warehouse. They tell Jones that they are studying it, but Jones does not believe them. Marion tries to comfort him by saying that she will buy him a drink."}

{"id": "23044", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23044", "title": "Ash Ketchum", "text": "Ash Ketchum (\u30b5\u30c8\u30b7 \"Satoshi\" in Japanese) is the main character of the Pok\u00e9mon anime. His first Pok\u00e9mon was Pikachu, which he has kept since the beginning of the series.\nConcept and creation.\nNamed after his and \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series creator Satoshi Tajiri, Satoshi was designed by Ken Sugimori and Atsuko Nishida, and was meant to represent Tajiri as a child. He has a character similar to him in the games, known as Red, who first appeared as the player-controlled protagonist (main character) in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Blue\". He is a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pok\u00e9mon, and use the creatures' special abilities to fight other Pok\u00e9mon, or use them for new ways to explore the game's world, such as instant travel between two areas. An animated version of the games later followed, with Satoshi voiced by Rica Matsumoto and was redesigned by Sayuri Ichishi.\nWhen they were changing the show so it was easier for North Americans to understand, the character's name was changed in the anime to \"Ash Ketchum\", the first name taken from one of the possible names players could choose for the character in the games, and the last name tying into 4Kids early catchphrase for the series, \"Gotta catch 'em all!\"\nTajiri said in an interview that, between Japanese and American reactions to the series, Japanese customers focused on Pikachu, while Americans bought more items featuring Ash and Pikachu together. He said that he felt the character represented (showed) what the franchise meant, the human nature, was necessary. Ash was given a rival, Shigeru. In an interview, Tajiri said the difference between the character's relationship in the games and anime; while in the games, trainers Red and Blue were enemies, in the anime, Shigeru represented Satoshi's mentor. When asked if in either case Satoshi would beat his rival, Tajiri replied \"No! Never!\" However, Ash has outdone Gary as a trainer in the anime, and Gary has since become a Pok\u00e9mon researcher like his grandfather, Professor Oak.\nAsh's character design was first managed by Sayuri Ichishi, replaced by Toshiya Yamada during the \"Diamond and Pearl\" story line.\nVoice acting.\nVeronica Taylor did the voice of Ash in seasons one through eight of the English version of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" anime. After the script was translated from Japanese, the lines were changed to fit the movements of the character's mouth (called \"lip flap\"). All the voices were recorded separately so Taylor was the only one there when she said her lines, which took about six to eight hours. Taylor was often the first person to record so she had to imagine how the previous line will be said. \"Luckily, I work with a great director who helps with the interpretation of the line, matching of the lip flap, and consistency of the voice.\" Taylor enjoyed playing Ash because of his \"low, husky (scratchy, deep) voice\" also well as \"energy and excitement\".\nTaylor said that Ash and the other characters \"loosened up\" after the first ten episodes of the anime; she believed the writers were more relaxed and felt the pressure of making sure everything was done correctly. Taylor commented: \"I enjoy playing [Ash] now much more than I did in the very beginning because I can have fun with him more, and we kind of know him and can work out how he really would react. We have the classic Ash responses and things like that.\" Sarah Natochenny replaced Taylor in season nine when Pok\u00e9mon International took over the dubbing rights (replacing and re-recording voices). In Japan, Rica Matsumoto is the voice of Ash.\nAppearances.\nIn video games.\nRed, the silent protagonist of \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\" and its remakes, \"Pok\u00e9mon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\", has many names, one of which is \"Red\". Some others are \"Ash\" (later used for anime character Ash Ketchum) and \"Jack\". In the game, Red is a young (most people think about 10 years old) boy from Pallet Town. His adventure begins one day when Professor Oak calls the two of them to his lab and gives them each a chance to choose their Pok\u00e9mon. After getting their Pok\u00e9mon, Blue challenges Red to a battle. Later, Professor Oak calls both Red and Blue and gives them both a Pok\u00e9dex each, and sends them on a journey to achieve his dream of capturing every type of Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn addition to the anime, Ash has appeared in video games and manga. The only video games that Ash has appeared in to date is \"Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League\", where he tries to become a Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle Master, and Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, where you play as Ash, starting with a Pikachu.\nIn the anime.\nIn the beginning, ten-year-old Ash is starting out as a beginner Pok\u00e9mon trainer in Pallet Town, his hometown. After getting Pikachu as a starter Pok\u00e9mon from Professor Oak, Ash left Pallet Town to start his journey. Since he left, Ash has traveled the world of Pok\u00e9mon, competed in many challenges, and caught many Pok\u00e9mon. He currently travels with Goh around the world in Pokemon Journeys.\nAsh has improved a lot as a trainer as the series went by. However, he is still excited and strong-willed. During the first season of the series, Ash trained to catch more Pok\u00e9mon than his childhood rival (person who you compete against), Gary Oak, although Gary was always shown to be the stronger trainer. He soon began to focus more on each of his Pok\u00e9mon's abilities. Ash's primary enemy is a group of antagonists named Team Rocket. Ever since the second episode, \"Pok\u00e9mon Emergency!\", two Team Rocket agents named Jessie and James, along with a talking Meowth, have tried to steal Ash's partner, Pikachu, as well as many others, but have always failed. While they fight a lot, they sometimes work together against a common enemy, like in \"\", where they help Ash in finding the three treasures in order to save the world.\nIn printed adaptations.\nThe descriptions of Ash in the manga \"The Electric Tale of Pikachu\", \"Pocket Monster Zensho\", and \"Ash &amp; Pikachu\", are much like in the anime. There are key differences in the manga, though. In \"The Electric Tale of Pikachu\", it is based on Ash's journey up until the end of the Orange Islands travel. Ash is usually seen traveling by himself during this manga, although he is sometimes joined by Misty and Brock in Indigo. Misty is the only one to join Ash in the Orange Islands. At the end of the series, The \"Ash &amp; Pikachu\" manga is similar, although it has the episodes from the anime like \"The Fortune Hunters\" and \"A Goldenrod Opportunity\" combined, but with a few changes. In \"Pocket Monsters Zensho\", Satoshi (as Ash is known in Japanese) starts with Charmander instead of Pikachu. The manga ends at the Indigo Plateau, where Satoshi beats the Elite Four. Manga author Toshihiro Ono said that Ash was one of his favorite characters to draw for the series, saying \"I want to go on a trip with Misty just like him! (And forget about job, rent, etc.)\".\nIn the \"Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\" manga, Red is a Pok\u00e9mon trainer and the main character of the first stories. Red starts off in Pallet Town, eager to be a trainer, and gets a Bulbasaur (who later evolves all the way into a Venusaur) and a Pok\u00e9dex from Professor Oak. He also has a Poliwhirl which he has known since childhood that evolves into a Poliwrath, and uses these two Pok\u00e9mon on his adventure. He later captures a troublesome Pikachu, and, after working to gain it's trust, it becomes one of Red's top three Pok\u00e9mon. Antagonists include his rival, Oak\u2019s grandson Blue, who was given Charmander; Green, another Pok\u00e9mon trainer from Pallet Town, who stole a Squirtle from Professor Oak; and Team Rocket, a group whose goal was to take over the world through Pok\u00e9mon.\nCritical reception.\nThe book \"The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture\" thought of Ash as an example of customer identification, with the character doing things players of the games had to in order to go further through them. It also made clear the character's growth as the anime series went by."}

Their home land is part of Eastern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, North Western Ontario, as well as the Northwest Territories. The M\u00e9tis Homeland also includes parts of the northern United States (specifically Montana, North Dakota, and northwest Minnesota). \nThe M\u00e9tis Nation are descendants the marriages of mainly of Cree and Ojibwe Indigenous peoples with French, Scottish or English settlers. Their history starts in the 18th century in the Western Canada. Historically, many western M\u00e9tis spoke a mixed language called Michif. \"Michif\" is the M\u00e9tis pronunciation of \"M\u00e9tis\". The M\u00e9tis today mostly speak English, with French as a strong second language, as well as many native language. The use of Michif is growing again thanks to the work of the provincial M\u00e9tis councils.\nThe word m\"\u00e9tis\" is a French word derived from \"m\u00e9tisser\", and is slightly related to the Spanish word \"mestizo\".\nM\u00e9tis culture.\nM\u00e9tis culture is a unique culture with similarities from First Nations, French Canadian, English, and Orkney/Scottish cultures. The M\u00e9tis are known for their love of fiddle playing, but traditional instruments also included the concertina, the harmonica, and the hand drum. This love for the fiddle has gone together with a kind of dancing called jigging. Traditionally, dancing included such moves as the Waltz Quadrille, the Square dance, Drops of Brandy, the Duck, La Double Gigue and the Red River Jig.\nM\u00e9tis people were famous for their horsemanship and breeding of horses. The RCMP Musical Ride horses dance the Quadrille as begun by the M\u00e9tis and their horses.\nAs the M\u00e9tis culture grew, a new language called Michif was spoken. This language was a general result of the combining of French nouns and Cree verbs. \nThe clothing worn by M\u00e9tis in the 19th century included the sash or \"ceinture flech\u00e9e\". It is traditionally about three metres in length and is made by weaving yarn together with one's fingers. The sash is worn around the waist, tied in the middle, with the fringed ends hanging. Vests with M\u00e9tis beadwork are also popular. The Red River Coat came from the Metis culture.\nThe M\u00e9tis were important in Canada's past, as fur traders who came from the east coast, voyageurs (coureur de bois), frontiersmen, pioneers, and interpreters between the First Nations peoples and the European colonists.\nProminent M\u00e9tis.\nThe most famous M\u00e9tis was Louis Riel, who led two rebellions which John A. Macdonald hated, the Red River Rebellion in 1869 in the area now known as Manitoba, and the North-West Rebellion in 1885 in the area now known as Saskatchewan. Some say these were not really rebellions. For example, in 1869 Riel was the leader of a government recognized by Canada as controlling territory that did not belong to Canada; Canada worked on the Manitoba Act with this government. After these \"rebellions\", land claimers and other non-M\u00e9tis took away the M\u00e9tis' land by taking advantage of a government program for buying it, with the government letting this happen. The province of Alberta gave some land to M\u00e9tis in 1938 to fix what it thought was not fair, but Saskatchewan and Manitoba have not done the same.\nTwo other famous M\u00e9tis leaders were Cuthbert Grant and Gabriel Dumont.\nActor August Schellenberg is of M\u00e9tis descent.\nBorn in 1940, in northern Saskatchewan, Metis writer and filmmaker Maria Campbell brought attention to the struggles of modern-day Metis and Aboriginal people with her book, \"Halfbreed\" (1973), and the play, \"Jessica\" (1982). She has shown the sound and song of traditional stories through her work in dialect, \"Stories of the Road Allowance People\" (1996).\nOn May 7, 2004, M\u00e9tis Todd Ducharme became a judge of the Ontario Supreme Court of Justice.\nOther well known Canadians of M\u00e9tis descent are Sharon Bruneau, a Canadian female bodybuilder and fitness model, and Kevin O'Toole, 1996 North American Lightheavyweight bodybuilding champion.\nBritish Columbia New Democratic Party Leader Carole James is of partly M\u00e9tis ancestry.\nNHL star defenceman Sheldon Souray is of M\u00e9tis ancestry.\nArchitect Douglas Cardinal is of M\u00e9tis and Blackfoot ancestry.\nNovelist Sandra Birdsell is the daughter of a M\u00e9tis man and a Russian Mennonite woman and wrote her award-winning novel \"Children of the Day\" partly on her parents' experience in Manitoba in the 1920s-50s."}

Java code looks like C, C++, or C#, but code written in those languages will not work in Java in most cases without being changed.\nJava runs on many different operating systems, including Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system (while Java continues to be used on Android, even by its maker Google, they no longer prefer Java; now is their preferred language, that can also be used with all Java code). This makes Java platform independent. It does this by making the Java compiler turn code into Java bytecode instead of machine code. This means that when the program is executed, the Java Virtual Machine interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code.\nJava concepts.\nJava was developed to achieve five main goals. These are:\nJava platform.\nThe \"Java platform\" refers to a group of software products from Sun Microsystems. The platform is used to develop and run Java programs. The platform includes the execution engine (called a Java Virtual Machine) that allows Java programs to do the same thing on different computer systems.\nThis capability of being able to develop software on one platform and running it on other platforms is called \"cross-platform capability\".\nProgramming example.\nAn example of a \"Hello World\" Java program:\n// This is a simple program in Java. It shows \"Hello World!\" on the screen. \npublic class HelloWorld {\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n System.out.println(\"Hello World!\"); \nTypes of Java programs.\nThere are many types of Java programs which run differently:\nBenefits.\nJava is commonly used to teach students how to program as a first language, but is still also used by professionals.\nCriticism.\nJava has also been criticized. Some of the criticisms are:"}

It describes a part of the Earth's existence lasting hundreds of millions to billions of years.\nA geologic eon is part of Earth's existence, made up of a number of eras of different lengths. A geologic era is made up of two or more shorter times called geologic periods. A geologic period is, in turn made up of yet shorter times called epochs. \nGeologists have given names to all of the eons, eras, periods and epochs that they have found by looking at rocks. The names given to each eon describe something about that time, or the rocks that were made at that time.\nFor example, we are now in the Phanerozoic eon, which comes from the Greek words for \"life that we can see\", that is, there were animals and plants big enough to see without a lens. This era started about 545 million years ago."}

It was written about five thousand years ago as part of the Mahabharata. It has teachings said to be given by Lord Sri Krishna who is the Supreme God. In the book (Bhagvat Gita), Krishna is talking to Arjuna, an Archer, before the kurukshetra war begins. Krishna tells Arjuna that he must perform his duty (called dharma) and go to fight. Arjuna hesitates because he is fighting his family, but in the end he listens to Krishna. He will not be led into the underworld for ever for his sins because he will not be reincarnated through Moksha.\nIt is considered to be the manual on which a human should follow his life according to Sanatana Dharma."}

The Upanishads are part of a large collection of sacred books of Hindu people, called the Vedas. They are placed at the end of the Vedas and they primarily deal with knowledge or wisdom. Because they deal with knowledge portion of the Vedas, they are called Jnana-Kanda (Jnana means knowledge). Also because they come at the end portion of the Vedas they are often called texts of \"Vedanta\" (\"veda\": of vedas, \"anta\": at the end). Upanishads form the foundation of the philosophy of Hindu religion. \nMany scholars believe that originally Upanishads are rebellion against Vedas and it has added to Vedas by its unique spiritual quest.\nUpanishad means \"sit down with\" master to learn about the Atman(soul).\nThe Upanishads do not belong to a specific period of Sanskrit literature. The oldest, such as the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad, may be as old as 8th century BC, while the youngest, depending on the specific Upanishad, may date to the medieval or early modern period. More than 300 text about Upanishad have been found but we have 108 Upanishad in written.\nGeeta which is the most religious book of Hindu's is also a Greatest Upanishad."}
{"id": "23103", "revid": "7233613", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23103", "title": "Concert", "text": "A concert (as in a \"concert tour\") is a performance in which a musician or many musicians play music together to a group of listeners (called an audience). In the case of a concert of classical music there may be an orchestra. There is often an important visual element to the performance, such as with a rock concert. However, if acting out a story is an important part of the performance, then this is called \"theatre\" or \"opera\" but some concerts have dramatic, theatrical music, with lights and special effects. Informal names for a concert include \"show\" or sometimes, \"gig\" for musicians who play in lots of different concerts, with different groups. A \"concert tour\" is a set of concerts where the performers travel to different cities or towns.\nThe performers at a concert are usually raised above the level of the audience on a stage. Concerts may be held in concert halls which are built for the purpose, or they may be held in any other suitable large building such as a school hall, a nightclub, a barn or a large house or castle. Some concerts are given to very large audiences in the open air. They may take place in a field or in a stadium. The music for these \u201copen-airs\u201d is usually amplified by loudspeakers so that large audiences can hear it.\nA concert given by just one performer (or perhaps two) is usually called a recital.\nA group of concerts in one place or in one area that takes place for several days may be called a \"festival\". Examples are: The Proms, the Edinburgh Festival, the Glastonbury Festival etc.\nBefore the days of recording, a concert would have been the only opportunity most people would have of hearing concerts given by groups.\nUsually people who go to a concert have to pay an admission charge. The money that is made from the ticket sales will usually go to paying the performing artistes, producers, and organisers. However, there are also benefit concerts where either the proceeds (all the ticket money) or profits (the money earned) will go to charity. Tickets for concerts can often be bought at the box-office of the concert hall or bought online. Sometimes concerts are free.\nTypes of concert.\nThe nature of a concert will vary by musical genre and the individual performers. Concerts by a small jazz combo or small bluegrass band may have the same order of program, mood, and volume, but vary in music and dress. In a similar way, a particular musician, band, or genre of music might attract concert attendees with similar dress, hairstyle, and behavior. For example, the hippies of the 60s often toted long hair (sometimes in dread lock form), sandals and inexpensive clothing made of natural fibers. The regular attendees to a concert venue might also have a recognizable style, comprising that venue's \"scene\".\nTheatrical.\nSome performers or groups put on very elaborate and expensive affairs, with parts of the show being similar to a theater performance. In order to create a memorable and exciting atmosphere and increase the spectacle, artists will have additional entertainment devices within their concerts. These tend to include: elaborate stage lighting; an image-magnification (IMAG) system and/or pre-recorded video; inflatables, artwork or other set pieces; various special effects, such as theatrical smoke and fog and pyrotechnics; and unusual costumes or wardrobe. Some singers, especially in genres of popular music, augment the sound of their concerts with pre-recorded accompaniment, back-up dancers, and even broadcast vocal tracks of the singer's own voice. Activities which may take place during these concerts include dancing, sing-alongs, and moshing. Some performers well known for including these elements in their performances include: Pink Floyd, Jean Michel Jarre, Sarah Brightman and KISS.\nFestivals.\nConcerts involving a greater number of artists, especially those that last for days, are known as festivals. Unlike other concerts, which typically remain in a single genre of music or work of a particular artist, festivals often cover a broad scope of music and arts. Due to their size, festivals are almost always held outdoors. A few examples of the hundreds of festivals include: Bayreuth Festival, Big Day Out, Coachella, Falls Festival, Glastonbury Festival, Mostly Mozart Festival, Newport Jazz Festival, Oxegen, Parachute Music Festival, Rock In Rio, Rockwave Festival, Salzburg Festival, Summer Sonic Festival, Tanglewood Music Festival, Woodstock Music and Art Festival, the Warped Tour, or the Umbria Jazz Festival.\nConcert tour.\nA concert tour is a series of concerts by an artist or group of artists in different cities or locations. Often, concert tours are named, to differentiate different tours by the same artist and associate a specific tour with a particular album or product (for example: Michael Jackson's Bad Tour). Especially in the popular music world, such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years. They are seen by thousands or millions of people, and bring in millions of dollars (or the equivalent) in ticket revenues. \nDifferent segments of longer concert tours are known as \"legs\". The different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways, dependent on the artist and type of tour, but the most common means of separating legs are dates (especially if there is a long break at some point), countries and/or continents, or different opening acts. In the largest concert tours, it is becoming more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment, local to each geographical region. Concert tours are often managed on the local level by concert promoters or by performing arts presenters.\nRevenue.\nWhile admission to some concerts is free, charging for tickets is very common. Historically, concerts were the main source of revenue for musicians. Revenue from ticket sales typically goes to the performing artists, producers, venue and organizers. In the case of benefit concerts, a portion of profits will often go towards a charitable organization.\nAdditional revenue is also often raised through in-concert advertising, from free local concerts for local sponsorships to sponsorships from corporations during major tours, such as 2009's \"Vans' Warped Tour Presented by AT&amp;T\". Both Vans and AT&amp;T would have paid significant amounts to have their company names included at the forefront in all marketing material for the Warped Tour.\nConcessions and merchandise are also often sold during and after concerts, often by the venue in the case of the former, and by the performing band or artist in the case of the latter.\nThe highest grossing concert tour of all time is The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour which earned approximately $558 million in between 2005 and 2007. The highest earning tour by a solo artist is the Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour by pop artist Madonna, which earned $408 million in 2008 and 2009."}
{"id": "23106", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23106", "title": "Palm tree", "text": "Palm tree is a common name of perennial lianas, shrubs, and trees. They are the only members of the family Arecaceae, which is the only family in the order Arecales. They grow in hot climates.\nWell known palm trees are:\nThere are about 2600 species of palm trees, most of them living in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate climates.\nPalms are one of the best known and most widely planted tree families. They have held an important role for humans throughout much of history. Many common products and foods come from palms. They are often used in parks and gardens that are in areas that do not have heavy frosts.\nIn the past palms were symbols of victory, peace, and fertility. Today palms are a popular symbol for the tropics and for vacations.\nRange.\nMost palm trees grow in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They occur from about 44\u00b0 northern latitude to about 44\u00b0 southern latitude. The dwarf palm (\"Chamaerops humilis\") occurs in southern France, the Nikau (\"Rhopalostylis sapida\") is a species of palm growing in New Zealand. The hardiest palm in the world is known as the needle palm (Rhapidophyllum Hystrix) and is able to handle temperatures below -18\u00b0C (0\u00b0F). \nShapes and flowers.\nMost palms are a straight, unbranched stem, but sometimes a branching stem, or even a creeping vine, such as the rattan. They have large evergreen leaves that are either 'fan-leaved' (palmate) or 'feather-leaved' (pinnate) and arranged in a spiral at the top of the trunk. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side when it is grown. The flowers grow on an inflorescence, a special branch just for carrying the great number of tiny flowers. The flowers are generally small and white, and are star-shaped. The sepals and petals usually number three each. The fruit is usually a single seed surrounded by flesh. The familiar coconut is the seed of a large fruit. Some kinds may contain two or more seeds in each fruit.\nWhere palms live.\nMore than two-thirds of palms live in tropical forests, where some species grow tall enough to form part of the canopy and other shorter palms form part of the understory. Some kinds form pure stands in areas with poor drainage or regular flooding. Other palms live on tropical mountains above 1000 meters, Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually where there is water, and in desert oases. A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils, while others are similarly adapted to very acidic soils.\nUnusual palms.\nThe Coco de mer has the largest seeds of any plant, 30-50 centimeters in diameter and weighing 15-30 kilograms each. Raffia palms, with leaves up to 25 meters long and 3 meters wide, have the largest leaves of any plant. The \"Corypha\" palms have the largest inflorescence (flowering part) of any plant, up to 7.5 meters tall and containing millions of small flowers. The wax palm, Colombia's national tree, is the tallest palm in the world, reaching heights of 70 meters.\nPalm fossils.\nPalms first appear in the fossil record around 80 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period. Some descendants from that period are still to be seen today, such as the nipa palm or mangrove palm.\nPalms in danger.\nLike many other plants, some palms are in danger of dying out because of human activity. The greatest dangers are from Increasingly large cities, mining, and turning forests into farmland. The harvesting of the heart of a palm for food also poses a threat, because it comes from the inner core of the tree, and harvesting it kills the tree. The use of rattan palms in furniture has caused a big fall in the number of rattan palms, as they are collected from the wild instead of being farmed. The sale of wild seeds to growers and collectors is another threat.\nAt least a hundred kinds are in danger, and nine kinds are said to have recently died out.\nIt is very hard to save palm seeds because they are killed by cooling them, which is the normal way of keeping rare seeds for the future. Also, planting rare kinds in parks can never truly recreate the wild areas they come from, and the plants may not do well in these parks.\nThe Palm Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) started in 1984, supported by the WWF. The group gathered a lot of information from different parts of the world. An action plan to save rare palms was made by this group in 1996.\nPest species.\nPests that attack species of palm trees include:\nPalm farming and use.\nDate palms in history.\nHuman use of palms is as old as, or even older than, civilization itself, starting with the growing of date palms by Mesopotamians and other Middle Eastern peoples 5000 years or more ago. The Date Palm had a great effect on the history of the Middle East. Historian W.H. Barreveld wrote:\nThe early importance of palms in the Middle East is shown in scripture. They are mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible, and more than 22 times in the Qur'an.\nPalms used for food and drink.\nApart from the well-known coconut and date, there are other kinds of food from palms. Palm oil, Sago, heart of palm and palm wine are all eaten or drunk in different parts of the world. Palm oil is used in everything, from cosmetics to food ingredients.\nUse in war.\nSouth Carolina is nicknamed the Palmetto State, after the sabal palmetto, logs from which were used to build the fort at Fort Moultrie. During the American Revolutionary War their spongy wood helped stop the British cannonballs.\nOther uses of palms.\nCoir is a coarse, water-resistant fibre from the outer shell of coconuts. It is used in doormats, brushes, mattresses, and ropes. 'Dragon's blood' is a resin used in dyes, varnishes and incense, can come from the fruit of the rattan. The \"Washingtonia robusta\" trees line Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, California.\nToday, palms are popular in parks and gardens in countries outside the tropics. two of the most cold-tolerant species are the Chusan palm, from eastern Asia, and the needle palm from the United States.\nThe palm as a symbol.\nThe palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory in Roman times. The Romans rewarded champions of the games and celebrated success in war with palm branches.\nJews also had a tradition of carrying palm branches during festive times.\nThe motto of the University of Southern California is \"Palmam qui meruit ferat\", which means in Latin, \"Let him bear the palm who has deserved it\".\nPalms appear on the flags and seals of several places where they are native, including those of Haiti, Guam, Florida, South Carolina, and Samoa.\nIn religion.\nThe palm has many meanings in both ancient and modern Middle Eastern religions.\nChristianity.\nEarly Christians used the palm branch to symbolize the victory of the faithful over enemies of the soul, as in the Palm Sunday festival celebrating the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem.\nIn Christian art, martyrs were usually shown holding palms representing the victory of spirit over flesh, and it was widely believed that a picture of a palm on a tomb meant that a martyr was buried there. Origen calls the palm \"the symbol of victory in that war waged by the spirit against the flesh. In this sense it was especially applicable to martyrs, the victors par excellence over the spiritual foes of mankind; hence the frequent occurrence in the Acts of the martyrs of such expressions as \"he received the palm of martyrdom\".\nIn other faiths.\nIn Judaism, the palm represents peace and plenty. The palm may also symbolize the Tree of Life in Kabbalah.\nThe Prophet Muhammad is said to have built his home out of palm, and the palm represents rest and hospitality in many cultures of the Middle East.\nPalm stems represented long life to the Ancient Egyptians, and the god Huh was often shown holding a palm stem in one or both hands.\nThe sacred tree of the Assyrians was a palm that represents the god Ishtar connecting heaven, the crown of the tree, and earth, the base of the trunk. The Mesopotamian goddess Inanna, who had a part in the sacred marriage ritual, was thought of as the one who made the dates abundant.\nThe palm tree was a sacred sign of Apollo in Ancient Greece because he had been born under one.\nModern times.\nThe palm, especially the coconut, remains a symbol of tropical island paradise.\nThe palm tree also represents Oasis.\nAt the birth of a child in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria , a coconut palm was planted to count the age of the child.\nCultural significance.\nRabindranath Tagore has written a long famous poem about a special genus of palm tree."}

She is married to Zeus. She is one of the Twelve Olympians. Hera is also a goddess of the sky and starry heavens. The Ancient Greeks said that Hera is one of the most beautiful goddess, nearly as pretty as Aphrodite. However, her jealous and vengeful nature make her less so.\nHer own special signs are the peacock, the pomegranate, and the cow. Her other important items are the crown and veil. \nHera's parents are Kronos and Rhea. Her brothers and sisters are Zeus (who she also married), Hestia, Demeter, Hades, and Poseidon. Hera has two daughter and two sons, Hebe, Eileithyia, Ares and Hephaestus. Her step-children include Athena, Dionysus, Persephone, and the twins, Apollo and Artemis. \nHera is the queen of all the Greek gods and goddesses. She is often thought of as being wise and serious. Hera is also called 'The Queen of Heaven' because she rules over Mount Olympus where all of the gods and goddesses live. Long before her marriage to Zeus, she ruled over the heavens and the Earth. She is responsible for every living thing, including the seasons and the weather. Some legends and ancient myth told that, Hera (Juno) is also the goddess of empire, queens and kingdoms. The name Hera means 'beautiful lady'.\nMyths about Hera's jealousy.\nDionysus.\nDionysus is a son of Zeus by a human woman. Hera tried to kill him when he was a baby with the Titans. The Titans were going to make Dionysis come to him by showing him toys, and then eat him. Zeus scared the Titans away with his thunderbolts, but the Titans had already eaten everything but Dionysus's heart. Zeus used the heart to make Dionysus again. He did this by putting the heart in the womb of Semele. Dionysus was then born for a second time.\nEcho.\nEcho is a nymph in Greek mythology. She once had the job of distracting Hera from Zeus having relationships with other women. She did this by leading Hera away and flattering her. When Hera found out she was very angry with Echo. She put a curse on her that meant that she could only speak the words of other people after she had heard them. It is due to this story that we get the meaning behind the word \"echo\".\nIo.\nIo is a mistress of Zeus. Hera almost caught Io and Zeus together, but Zeus hid Io by turning her into a cow. Hera was not fooled and said that Zeus had to give her the cow as a present. Once Io belonged to Hera she was looked after by Argus. It was Argus's job to make sure that Io and Zeus were never together. Zeus ordered Hermes to kill Argus so that Io would be free. Hermes did this by killing Argus after he had been lulled to sleep. Hera then sent a gadfly to sting Io as she walked about on the earth.\nLamia.\nLamia is a queen of Libya who Zeus was in love with. Hera was jealous of Lamia and turned her into a monster. When she was a monster, Lamia then killed her children. Another version of this story is that Hera killed Lamia's children and was then so sad that she turned into a monster. Hera also put a curse on Lamia. The curse was that Lamia could not close her eyes. Hera chose this curse because she wanted Lamia to always think about the picture of her dead children. Zeus then gave Lamia the gift of being able to take her eyes out, so that she could rest. She could then put them back in again afterwards.\nLeto.\nWhen Hera found out that Leto was pregnant with twins by Zeus she was angry. She banished Leto from Olympus, she also banned her from giving birth on any mainland or island that was known. Leto found a floating island, called Delos. It was neither a mainland or a \"real\" island, so Leto was allowed to give birth there. Artemis was born first, who then helped Leto to give birth to Apollo. After Artemis and Apollo was born, Hera was furious. So she sent the snake-monster, Python to hunt Leto and her twins. When Apollo reached to his adulthood, he slayed Python in Delphi and decreed that the humans will built a temple there in honour of his victory against Python. Few years later, Hera sent a giant named Tityos to rape Leto, but he was killed by Apollo and Artemis. Delos was later held down with four pillars so that it would not float around anymore. It is said to be surrounded by swans and later became a sacred place to Apollo.\nHeracles.\nHeracles is the stepson and enemy of Hera. Hera discovered that her husband, Zeus had an affair with a mortal women named Alcmene and she became extremely jealous at the mortal woman. Hera used all the power she had to prevent Alcmene from giving birth to Heracles. When Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Hera requested that Zeus swore an oath and declare upon all the other Gods that the descendant of Perseus will be born on that day and the child will rule eveything around him. Then Hera descended from Olympus to Argos and cause the wife of Sthenelus, son of Perseus to gave birth to Eurystheus after only seven months while Hera tried to prevent Alcmene into giving birth to Heracles by sending her daughter Eileithyia and witches. This cause the fullfilment of Zeus' oath in that it was Eurystheus instead of Heracles. Hera continues her wrath on Heracles while he was still an infant. She send two poisonous snakes to Heracles to kill him in his cradle. Heracles throttled the snake with his bare hands and the nurse saw him playing with the dead snake as if they were a child's toy. Hera continues to torture her stepson throughout his life."}

One common \"plane mirror\" is a piece of special flat glass that a person can look into to see a reflection of themselves or what is behind them.\nSometimes, a flat piece of metal or the surface of water can act like a mirror.\nThe reason you are able to see yourself in a mirror is because light comes in and gets reflected, and that's how you are able to see your reflection. \nMirrors can have magnification properties, making images appear smaller or larger than their actual size. They can also be concave (curved inward) or convex (curved outward), making the reflected angle and view to be smaller or larger, respectively.

The show follows an animated blue-spotted dog named Blue as she plays a game with the host and the viewers.\n\"Blue's Clues\" became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was critical to Nickelodeon's growth. It has been called \"one of the most successful, critically acclaimed, and ground-breaking preschool television series of all time\".\nHistory.\n\"Blue's Clues\" was developed during difficult period for children's television. In 1990, Congress had passed the Children's Television Act. This required networks and TV stations to devote a portion of their programming to children's shows. The legislation set no guidelines or criteria for educational programs and had no provisions for enforcement. According to author Diane Tracy, \"The state of children's television was pretty dismal.\nSince the late 1960s, PBS was one of the few sources for children's educational television programming in the U.S., and most other U.S. children's TV shows were violent and created for the purpose of selling toys. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled in 1997 that the commercial broadcast networks had to air educational children's programs for a minimum of three hours per week. The cable network Nickelodeon, which had been airing programs for six- to twelve-year-olds, was not legally bound by this legislation but complied with it anyway many years before the laws and regulations were passed.\nBased on research.\nThe show's producers and creators presented material in a narrative format instead of the more traditional magazine format. They used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way.\nThey used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been done in the thirty years since the start of \"Sesame Street\" in the U.S. This revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. \"Blue's Clues\" was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers. It looks like a storybook with primary colors and simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures.\nIts home-based setting is familiar to American children, but has a look unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of \"Blue's Clues\", which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.\nMalcolm Gladwell noted that Sesame Street appealed to both children and adults, but Blue's Clues was solely aimed at preschool children. They like stories, repetition and joining in the answers. \"Every\" episode of Blue was tested on preschool children, and the research noted how much of the time children watched the screen. The order of clues was tested. All aspects of the program could be changed if the testing suggested it would work better some other way.\nSuccess.\nBy 2002, \"Blue's Clues\" had received several awards for excellence in children's programming, educational software, and licensing, and had been nominated for nine Emmy Awards. It has been syndicated in 120 countries and translated into 15 languages. Regional versions of the show featuring local hosts have been produced in other countries. It was one of the first preschool shows to incorporate American Sign Language into its content. The show's extensive use of research in its development and production process inspired several research studies that have provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool.\nReboot.\nIn 2017, a reboot of Blue's Clues was announced. It premiered on November 11, 2019."}

This company is named after its founder, Henry Ford.\nThese brands are also made by Ford:\nHistory.\nIn 1896, Henry Ford had an idea to make a Quadricycle, the first \"horseless carriage\" he built. This four-wheeled vehicle was very different from cars we drive now. It was very different even from vehicles Ford produced just a few years later. Even so, this was the start of Ford's career as a businessman. Until the Quadricycle, Ford's work had been experimental and theoretical. For example, in the 1890s, Ford built a gas engine on his kitchen table \u2014 just an engine with nothing to power. Enough people liked the Quadricycle, and much could be done with the it, so it led to the beginning of Ford's business.\nFord Motor Company started on June 16, 1903, when Henry Ford and 11 business helpers signed papers to form the company. Their first Ford production car, the Model A, was sold in Detroit, Michigan a few months later. (This Model A should not be confused with their more famous Model A, which came out in 1927). With $280,000 (around 165 000 pounds), the early businessmen made what was to become one of the world's largest companies. Few companies changed the history and development of industry and society in the 20th century as much as Ford Motor Company.\nMass production on the line.\nFord Motor Company's most important contribution to automotive manufacturing was the (moving) assembly line. First implemented at the Highland Park plant (in Michigan, US) in 1913, this new method let each workers to stay in one place, to do the same job repeatedly as the vehicles went by on the assembly line. The line proved to be very efficient; it helped the company make more cars, and make them cheaper than other car companies could do at the time. Before using the assembly line, Ford made 12,000 Model T's in a year. With the assembly line, Ford could make 12,000 Model T's in just two days. Ford had discovered how to make more cars that more people could afford to buy. He even paid his workers higher salaries than other car companies and still made money.\nEarly growth.\nHenry Ford insisted that the company's future lay in the production of affordable cars for a mass market. In 1903, the company began using the first 19 letters of the alphabet to name new cars. In 1908, the Model T was born, and it was sold for 19 years. By selling 15 million Model T's, Ford Motor Company became a giant company which spanned the globe. They built plants in the Soviet Union, Japan and other places. Ford started making farm tractors, trucks and school buses. In 1925, Ford Motor Company bought the Lincoln Motor Company. It uses that name to build luxury cars. In the 1930s, the name \"Mercury\" was given to its mid-priced cars. Ford Motor Company was growing.\nBritish Models.\nThe 1920s\nThe 1930s\n1932 Ford Model B Coup\nThe 1950s\nThe 1960s\nThe 1970s\nThe 1980s\nThe 1990s \nThe 2000s\nAmerican Models.\nCurrent"}

{"id": "23190", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23190", "title": "John Constable", "text": "John Constable (East Bergholt, Suffolk 11 June 1776 \u2013 London, 31 March 1837) was an English painter and artist.\nHis family had plenty of money because his father owned a business running corn mills. Constable's father wanted his son to take over the business after him, but Constable started painting at an early age, and convinced his father to let him follow art as a career.\nHe married Maria Bicknell in 1816, and they had seven children. She died in 1829 of tuberculosis.\nHis paintings are treasures of British art, but in his lifetime his work was appreciated more in France. Constable's most famous painting, \"The Hay Wain\" (now in the National Gallery in London), was first shown at the Paris Salon in 1824. He had to wait until he was 52 years old before the Royal Academy voted that he should be a member.\nConstable was influenced by the French painter Claude Lorrain. His most famous paintings are landscapes showing the countryside around Dedham and Flatford, where his father's mills were.\nHis art.\nConstable's idea was to use nature itself, rather than imagination. He told Leslie, \"When I sit down to make a sketch from nature, the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture\".p51\nAlthough Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the market of patrons and R.A. exhibitions, on-the-spot studies were essential. He never just followed a formula. \"The world is wide\", he wrote, \"no two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world; and the genuine productions of art, like those of nature, are all distinct from each other\".p64\nConstable painted many full-scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes in order to test the composition in advance of finished pictures. These large sketches, with their free and vigorous brushwork, were revolutionary at the time. The sketches for and convey a vigour missing from his finished oil paintings of the same subjects. Compare the composition of this preliminary study with the finished painting: . Possibly more than any other aspect of Constable's work, the oil sketches reveal him to be an avant-garde painter, one who showed that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction.\nConstable's watercolours were also remarkably free for their time. The almost mystical \"Stonehenge\", 1835, with its double rainbow, is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolours ever painted. When he exhibited it in 1836, Constable appended a text to the title: \"The mysterious monument of Stonehenge, standing remote on a bare and boundless heath, as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present, carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period\".p89\nIn addition to the full-scale oil sketches, Constable completed numerous studies of landscapes and clouds, to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions. , for example, prompted a critic to write: \"the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it, that almost imparts the wish for an umbrella\".p9\nThe sketches were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air. To convey the effects of light and movement, Constable used broken brushstrokes, often in small touches, which he worked over lighter passages. This gave an impression of sparkling light over the landscape. One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is \"Seascape Study with Rain Cloud\", painted in around 1824 at Brighton, which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes an exploding shower at sea.p128 Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects, for example in \"Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows\", 1831, and in \"\", 1833.\nTo the sky studies he added notes, often on the back of the sketches, of the prevailing weather conditions, direction of light, and time of day, believing that the sky was \"the key note, the standard of scale, and the chief organ of sentiment\" in a landscape painting.p110 In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the meteorologist Luke Howard on the classification of clouds.p68 \"I have done a good deal of skying\", Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821.p56\nConstable once wrote in a letter to Leslie, \"My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge, and in every lane, and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up\".p129 He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be. Constable's art inspired not only contemporaries like G\u00e9ricault and Delacroix, but the Barbizon School, and the French impressionists of the late nineteenth century."}

{"id": "23220", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23220", "title": "McGurk effect", "text": "The McGurk effect shows how hearing and vision are used for speech perception. Named after the man who found it, Harry McGurk (23 February 1936 \u2013 17 April 1998), it says that people hear speech with their ears, and use other senses to help interpret what they hear. The McGurk effect happens when watching a video of a person saying /ga/ with a sound-recording saying /ba/. When this is done, a third sound is heard: /da/.\nThe McGurk effect is robust: that is, it still works even if a person know about it. This is different from some optical illusions, which do not work anymore once a person can see it.\nOverview.\nThe McGurk effect describes a phenomenon that shows how speech perception is not dependent only on auditory information. Visual information in the form of reading the lips is also taken into account and combined with the auditory information that is heard to produce the final stimuli perceived. This can get particularly interesting when the auditory information of one sound, paired with the spoken lips of another sound, ultimately combine to form the perception of a third different sound.\nExplanation.\nWhen humans perceive speech, they not only take in auditory information but also visual information as well in the form of reading lips, facial expression, and other body bodily cues. Usually, these two sources of information are consistent with each other so the brain simply combines them to form one unified perceived stimuli. When the McGurk effect is tested and the incoming information from the ears and eyes differ, the brian tries to make sense of the contradictory stimuli which ultimately results in a fusion of both. In humans, information received from the eyes dominates other sensory modalities, including audition, so for instance when 'ba' is heard and 'ga' is seen, the resulting stimuli is heard is 'da'. The resulting stimuli is what happens when the brain tries to make sense of the two different sets of information.\nSimilar work by others.\nInterestingly enough, around the same time that Harry McGurk and John Macdonald discovered what is now known as the McGurk effect, another British researcher also stumbled upon this phenomenon. Barbara Dodd discovered a similar effect with audio-visual speech interpretation but instead it was with the visual cue of 'hole' and the audio cue of 'tough' which ultimately generated the audio perception of 'towel'. These discoveries in audio-visual speech perception ultimately changed the way scientists and researchers view the interaction of different senses in the brain.\nInfants.\nInfants also show signs similar to the McGurk effect. Obviously you cannot ask the infant what they hear since they cannot verbally communicate yet but by measuring certain variables such as their attention to audiovisual stimuli, effects similar to the McGurk effect can be seen. Very soon after infants are born, sometimes even within minutes of birth, they are able to imitate adult facial movements; an important first step in audiovisual speech perception. Next comes the ability to recognize lip movements and speech sounds a couple of weeks after birth. Evidence of the McGurk effect is not visible though until about 4 months of age, with a much stronger presence at around 5 months after birth. To test this effect on infants, infants are first habituated to a stimuli. Once the stimuli gets changed, the infant exhibits an effect similar to the McGurk effect. As infants grow older and continue to develop, the McGurk effect also becomes more prominent as visual cues start to override purely auditory information in audiovisual speech perception.\nEffect in other languages and cultures.\nAlthough the McGurk effect has been primarily studied in English because of its origins in English speaking countries, research has now spread to others countries with different languages as well. In particular, the comparison between English and Japanese has been prominent. Research has shown that the McGurk effect is much more prominent in English listeners compared to Japanese listeners. One strong hypothesis for this is the difference between cultures and how each culture behaves and interacts. Japanese culture is notable for being politeness and avoiding direct eye or face contact when interacting.\nThis phenomenon has also been studied in French Canadian children and adults with similar findings. When compared to adults though, children tend to show less susceptibility to the McGurk effect since their primary sense of speech perception is dominated by auditory information. This is evident in children scoring lower on lip reading tasks when compared to adults. Nevertheless, the McGurk effect was present in certain contexts but the effects were much more variable than when the tests were run on adults.\nBroader impact on society.\nAlthough the McGurk effect's importance may seem isolated to just psychological researchers and scientists, this phenomenon has been expanded to everyday audio and visual speech perception as well. Two researchers by the name of Wareham and Wright conducted a study in 2005 that may suggest that the McGurk effect can influence how everyday speech is perceived. This is especially important in witness testimony where the observations and accounts of the witness are usually expected to be accurate and correct. With this information, witness testimonies now must be interpreted with the notion that the witness may be unaware of their own inaccurate perception."}

Turner", "text": "Joseph Mallord William Turner (Covent Garden, London, 23 April 1775 \u2013 Chelsea, London, 19 December 1851) was an English painter and artist. He was one of the greatest artists of landscape painting, with a great mastery of light and colour.\nHis father was a maker of wigs. His mother was ill with mental problems, and the young Turner was sent to live with his uncle in Brentford, where he first started to paint.\nTurner became a student at the Royal Academy of Art school in London when he was 14 years old. He was accepted into the Academy a year later. He had a watercolour painting in 1790 in the Academy's important art show. He had only been studying for a year. In 1802, at the age of only 28, he was elected a member of the Royal Academy, and later became its Professor of Perspective. \nIn 1802, Turner travelled around Europe, visiting France and Switzerland. He also went to the Louvre in Paris. During his life, he often travelled across Europe, visiting Venice in Italy several times. As his personal style developed, he began to produce paintings that were generalised or exaggerated in form and colour, rather than realistic or detailed. These caused much argument as to their artistic value, but nowadays are his best loved works. On his death, he left 300 oils and 20,000 watercolours to the British nation. Some of his watercolours are the most abstract or generalised of his paintings.\nTurner never married, although he had two children with his mistress Sarah Danby. For much of his life, he lived with his father, who helped him in his studio until he died in 1829.\nIn his early career, Turner was influenced by the painters Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, who painted \"historical\" landscapes.\nTurner became interested in natural catastrophes, and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea. His paintings revolve around the light of the sun, shown in infinite variety. His work showed some of the ideas of the impressionists decades before they arrived on the scene. Monet, in particular, studied Turner's methods. \nHis most famous paintings include \"The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up\". Often called just \"The Fighting Temeraire\", this is a picture of a famous warship that was used in the Battle of Trafalgar. Other pictures include \"Rain, Steam and Speed\", which shows a steam train crossing a bridge, and \"Snowstorm\" which shows a steamship in a snowstorm trying to get into a harbour. In order to get the right feeling into this painting, he had himself tied to a ship's mast during a storm, so that he could see what it was like. Some of his most famous paintings show the roughness of nature, with bleak landscapes and violent storms.\nBut also there is beauty and a sense of calmness in pictures such as Crossing the Brook, a stunning scenic view of the Tamar Valley and River from New Bridge near Gunnislake in Cornwall, painted in 1815, a view which can still be admired today. \nAs he grew older, Turner's behaviour became a bit odd, and he became depressed quite often. He died in Chelsea on 19 September 1851, and was buried next to the painter Joshua Reynolds in St Paul's Cathedral.\nEven while Turner was alive, some people thought he was a genius. Some people complained that the pictures he painted when he was older were not realistic, and some even joked that they could have been painted with a mop. However, most think that his way of painting shows complete mastery."}

His father wanted him to help run the family's grocery business. However, Monet wanted to be an artist. When he was young he met the painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin who taught him to use oil paints, and encouraged him to paint out of doors.\nMonet joined the French Army in Algeria for two years from 1860-1862. When he became ill he left the army to study art at university. He did not like the way art was taught, and joined the painter Charles Gleyre in his studio. He met other artists here, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley. They shared their ideas about painting.\nIn 1866 Monet had a child with Camille Doncieux, who had been his model. They married in 1870 and had two children, Michel and Joseph. In 1870 he moved to England to escape the Franco-Prussian War, and in 1871 he moved to Argenteuil near Paris where he painted some of his most famous pictures. In 1873 he painted \"Impression, Sunrise\", showing the sea at Le Havre. When this picture was shown in 1874 one critic took its title and called the group of artists \"Impressionists\". He intended to make fun of the artists, but the name has stuck and this is what people today call this style of painting.\nIn 1879 Camille died of tuberculosis. Alice Hosched\u00e9 decided to help Monet by taking care of his children as well as her own. In 1883 they moved to a house in Giverny where Monet planted a large garden. Monet married Alice in 1892.\nMonet found that his garden inspired him to paint pictures of it, particularly the water lilies. Alice died in 1911, and his son Jean was killed in World War I in 1914.\nMonet used broad brush strokes to build up his pictures, and painted quite quickly to try and get the idea of the light he could see into his paintings. If you go very close to one of his pictures it is hard to see what it shows, but if you stand back everything becomes clear.\nHis later paintings include series, in which he paints the same subject in different lights. For example, he painted a series of pictures of haystacks in a field, and another series of pictures of the west front of Rouen Cathedral. There are many paintings of the lilies in his garden at Giverny."}

Exodus in Hebrew is called \"Shmowt\", which means 'names.' \nExodus means 'going out' in Latin. It is about how the Hebrew people were led out of Egypt by God. Moses, their leader, hears God's words and then tells the Israelites. Exodus ends with God's laws and his instructions on how to build a holy container called the Ark of the Covenant. \nSummary.\nAfter the Hebrews went to Egypt to get food, the old Pharaoh died, and a new Pharaoh came to power and made each Hebrew a slave. The Pharaoh made the Hebrews work very hard and told his soldiers to throw their babies into the Nile River. One baby, Moses, was put in a reed basket set adrift on the Nile. He was later rescued by an Egyptian princess, grew up in Pharaoh's palace, and later killed an Egyptian slaveowner. Moses escaped from Egypt and lived away from his people in Midian. He lived with Jethro, his father-in-law.\nOne day, while Moses was tending his flocks, God appeared in a burning bush to Moses and instructed him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. As Moses had no confidence in doing this, God gives him his brother Aaron to help him. Aaron was good at speaking and helped Moses speak to the Pharaoh.\nWhen he returned to Egypt, Moses asked the Pharaoh to let the Israelites go, but the Pharaoh refused. Through God's power, Moses causes ten plagues to come on Egypt.\nThe last plague was the death of all the firstborns in Egypt. Only the Israelites' firstborns were spared, as they had the blood of a young lamb on their door, so God did not let the Angel of Death enter their houses (12:23). The Pharaoh finally decided to let the Israelites go. \nWhile the Israelites were crossing the Red Sea, the Pharaoh changed his mind and decided to pursue them with his troops. The Israelites passed safely as Moses parted the Sea with his staff by God's power. Once the Hebrews all passed the sea closed, leaving all the Pharaoh's troops to drown.\nLater, at Mount Sinai, Moses received the law and the Ten Commandments from God. But the Israelites sinned against God by worshiping an idol (a golden calf). Moses broke the first two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments in anger. God later gave him another two. He also told Moses how to build the Ark of the Covenant.\nTen Times the Israelites rebeled and tested the L-D during Exodus despite his revealation to them; according to rabbanic literature it was because \"..They were still laboring under the slave mentality of the Egyptian bondage.\"\nMedia.\nThe book has been filmed several times, as \"The Ten Commandments\" and \"The Prince of Egypt\"."}

At that time, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. The station was situated 110 kilometres north of Kyiv.\nThis event was one of the worst accidents in the history of nuclear power. It was rated level 7, the most severe level, on the International Nuclear Event Scale. The only other accident with a level 7 rating is Fukushima. Because the RBMK reactors used at the plant had no containment building to keep the radiation in, radioactive fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the eastern United States. Large areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were badly contaminated. About 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus. About 360,000 people needed to be moved to other places, where they could live after the accident. In addition, many people suffered from acute radiation poisoning and long-term illnesses such as thyroid cancer.\nOn the day of the accident, there was a planned power reduction. By the beginning of the day shift, the power level had reached 50%. Following this, randomly, one of the regional power stations went offline. It was then requested that the further power reduction would be postponed. That request was made at the afternoon of April 25 and further power down was allowed after 22:00.\nA turbine generator run down test was scheduled to take place before the routine shutdown. At 00:05 on April 26, the power was at around 23%. 30 minutes later the power fell to a near-zero level, probably due to change of regulator. At 01:00 the power stabilized at around 6% and the test would be run at that level. A turbine was switched off and its oscillations were measured. Shift foreman A.F. Akimov reported to deputy-chief engineer A.S. Dyatlov (who supervised the power down) that the oscillations were measured and a final briefing was given. Everyone went to their instruments and at 01:23:04 the turbine generator run down test began. Everything went completely normal. The reactor showed tendency to accelerate as the cooling pumps connected to the turbine generator were slowing, and due to the property called positive void coefficient of reactivity - as number of so-called \u2018voids\u2019 (e.g. steam bubbles) increases due to increased boiling or loss of coolant, so does the reactivity. But the operators successfully kept the reactor in control and it did not accelerate. At 01:23:40 SIUR (senior reactor chief control engineer) L.F. Toptunov pressed the emergency protection button as planned for the shutdown, at the end of the test. The power was at 7% when the button was pressed. But instead of shutting down, the reactor suffered a power surge. This was due to the reactor being unstable at low power and the shutdown system having severe design flaws. At 01:23:43 the power jumped to 17% and due to the power increase, the automatic control rods suffered damage, and they jammed. Fuel channels ruptured and at 01:23:47 the reactor exploded.\nThe explosion was so powerful that it blew the 1000 ton steel lid off the reactor. Due to this explosion, large amounts of radioactive materials and fuel were released. This caused the neutron moderator, made of graphite, to start to burn. The fire caused more radioactive fallout to be released, which was carried by the smoke of the fire into the environment.\nAfter the accident, Reactor 4 was covered by a \"sarcophagus\" made from steel and concrete to stop the escape of more radiation from the lost corium as well as radioactive dust. The sarcophagus was covered in 2016 with the New Safe Confinement structure.\nThe accident raised concerns about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry. The Soviet Union slowed the process of making its nuclear industry bigger for some time. The Soviet government also had to become less secretive as a result of the accident. Since 1991, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus have become separate countries. Those countries have continued to pay the high costs for decontamination (removing the radiation) and health care because of the accident. Exposure to radiation leads to a higher risk of getting cancer.\nIt is difficult to accurately tally the number of deaths caused by the events at Chernobyl. A 2005 IAEA report tells of 56 direct deaths; of those, 47 were accident workers and 9 were children who died of thyroid cancer. The report thinks that up to 4,000 people may die from long term diseases related to the accident. However, other estimates range from 4,000 to 27,000 by the Union of Concerned Scientists or Greenpeace who estimate that between 93,000 - 200,000 people died as a result of the disaster.\nThe other three reactors at Chernobyl continued to operate after the disaster because there were not enough other power plants in Ukraine to meet energy demands. Reactor 2 was decommissioned (permanently turned off and stopped being used) in 1991 after a fire in its turbine hall. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in 1996, and reactor 3 was decommissioned in 2000. In 2018, a 3800 panel, 1 megawatt solar plant was opened next to the former nuclear plant."}

It lies in Kyiv Oblast, near the border with Belarus. It was home to Chernobyl nuclear power plant workers. The city was abandoned in 1986 after the Chernobyl accident, the worst nuclear reactor accident in history. Before being abandoned, about 48,000 people lived in the city. The city was founded in the 1970s, when the nuclear power plant opened.\nThe site today is practically a museum showing the late Soviet era. With entirely abandoned buildings, including abandoned apartment buildings (four of which were yet to be used), swimming pools and hospitals, everything inside remains, from records to papers to children's toys and clothing. Pripyat and the surrounding area will not be safe for people to live there for several centuries. Scientists think that the most dangerous radioactive elements will take up to nine hundred years to decay sufficiently to render the area safe.\nThe city is entirely accessible and is relatively safe on the road, although it is unsafe to go around the city without a radiation dosimeter that measures exposure. The doors of all the buildings are open to reduce the risk to visitors, although many have accumulated too much radioactive material to be safe to visit."}

It is built around the reactor to keep the radiation from getting out, if something happens to the reactor. The containment building is the last barrier to the radiation getting into the environment. Containment systems for nuclear power reactors are distinguished by size, shape, materials used, and suppression systems. The kind of containment used is determined by the type of reactor, generation of the reactor, and the specific plant needs.\nThe Chernobyl accident was very bad partly because the Soviet RBMK reactors used at the Chernobyl power plant had no containment buildings. The explosion, however, was so powerful that it is unlikely a containment building would have completely prevented the release of radiation.\nLayers of nuclear defense.\nThe diagram shows the order of defense layers for a nuclear reactor. The first layer of defense is the inert, ceramic quality of the uranium oxide itself. The second layer is the air tight zirconium alloy of the fuel rod. The third layer is the reactor pressure vessel made of steel more than a dozen centimeters thick. The fourth layer is the pressure resistant, air tight \"containment building\". The fifth layer is the exclusion zone around the reactor."}

A long time ago, it came from the coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, from Syria and the maritime (next to the sea) parts of Asia Minor and northern Iran at the south end of the Caspian Sea. It has been farmed for a very long time. The Ancient Greeks were farming it. They spread the trees to the western part of the Mediterranean. \nOlive trees like soil with lots of chalk in it. They grow best on limestone slopes and crags in coastal climate. \nOverview.\nThe Wild Olive is a small tree or shrub that grows up to 8\u201315 m tall with thorny branches. The leaves are opposite, 4\u201310 cm long and 1\u20133\u00a0cm wide. The leaves have a dark greyish-green color above and are pale with whitish scales below. The small white flowers, with calyx and corolla divided into four parts, two stamens and bifid stigma, are mostly on the last year's wood, in racemes coming up from the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a small drupe 1\u20132\u00a0cm long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars.\nUses.\nToday, olive trees are grown for the following reasons:\nThe numbers behind.\nIn total, about 17.3 million tons of olives are produced every year. 60% of all olive trees are in the European Union. The top producers are:\nCultural significance.\nVery probably, the first olive trees were grown in Syria. From there they spread rapidly. In Ancient Greece, the tree was considered to be holy. Some city states (polis) like Athens punished people for cutting down olive trees.\nThe branches in the flag of the United Nations are those of an olive tree.\nIn Christianity, the olive tree can be a sign of peace, because according to the Bible, a dove brought an olive branch to Noah to show that the flood was over.\nThe olive tree is the National tree of Palestine."}

It is common between two people in a non-formal (informal) setting, but can also be used in a formal setting. There are also many other ways of saying \"hello\", for example a wave of the hand, a salute or a bow (both very formal), a handshake (a little formal) or a high five (very informal). Saying \"hello\" is a sign of politeness, especially when it is said in a friendly way. \"Hello\" was first used in writing in about 1833.\nMany people say \"Hello\" when they answer a phone call.\nOther greetings like \"hello\" include; Hi, Hallo, Hiya, Howdy, Hey, Howya, 'Sup, Yo, 'Yello, Herro, Greetings, Good day, What's poppin', G'day mate, Top of the mornin' to you, Ay up, what's up mate and many more.\nPeople then often say \"goodbye\" when they leave each other. \"Goodbye\" is a shortened version of the religious farewell expression \"God be with ye\", which indicates the user's religious belief, usually in a single god. Similar expressions exist in other languages such as: adieu, adieus, adieux, adios. These terms also possess religious undertones as they are derived from the Latin word \"deus\", meaning \"god\". This of course does not always mean they are religious."}

Another way to spell its name is Tyva. It is in south Siberia. It is grouped and governed as part of Siberian Federal District. The Siberian Federal District contains nine other federal subjects too. Tuva also shares an international border with Mongolia.\nHistory.\nDuring the Chinese Qing Dynasty, Tuva was part of the province of Mongolia. From 1921 to 1944, Tuva was a separate country called Tannu-Tuva. In 1944, it joined the Soviet Union. In 1991, it continued to be part of Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nGeography and climate.\nKyzyl is the capital city of Tuva. The name means \"red\" in Tuvan. Tuvans say that Kyzyl is the exact center of Asia. And there is a monument to the Center of Asia in the capital. But others think that Kyzyl is not the exact center of Asia. Nevertheless, Tuva is in Central Asia. And Tuvan culture is similar to the culture of their neighbors in other Central Asian countries.\nTuva is in a mountain basin between the Sayan Mountains and the Tannu-Ola Mountains. In the east, Tuva has forests. In the west, the land is drier.\nThe average temperature in January is \u221232\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221225.6\u00a0\u00b0F). The average temperature in July is +18\u00a0\u00b0C (64.4\u00a0\u00b0F).\nDemographics.\nTuva's population at the end of the Soviet Union stayed about the same for some time, according to data. It is currently increasing again. A little bit more than half of the population live in cities and towns. Most of the people that live in cities and towns live in Kyzyl. Ethnic Tuvans make up the most of the population. Most ethnic Tuvans practice a religion that is mixed with Tibetan Buddhism and Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature.\nLanguage.\nTuvans speak their own language, which is called Tuvan. It is a Turkic language. And it is related to Turkish. Before Tuva joined the Soviet Union, the Tuvan language used the Roman alphabet, which is the same alphabet that English uses. Since Tuva joined the Soviet Union, they have used the Cyrillic alphabet, which is the same alphabet that Russian uses. Because Tuva is part of Russia, Tuvans also learn to speak Russian.\nCulture.\nBefore they joined the Soviet Union, Tuvans were nomadic people. They traveled on horses. Therefore, horses were very important in Tuvan culture. Tuvan art often shows horses. And many Tuvan songs are about horses. Tuvans lived in yurts (round, felt covered houses that are easy to take apart and carry). Even today, a few Tuvans are nomads. Ethnically they are Mongols. \nTuvans are famous for their throat singing. Throat singing is a very old art. And it is very special because a throat singer can sing two or more notes at the same time. Throat singers imitate the sounds of nature. They can sound like a bird or like the howling wind. One style of throat singing has a rhythm like a horse trotting. For many centuries only men were allowed to be throat singers. But now women are throat singers too. Singing more than one note at the same time is sometimes called overtone singing.\nTannu-Tuva was also famous for its colorful and unusual postage stamps. Some were triangles. Many showed interesting pictures of life in Tuva."}

The city is an independent municipality not part of any provinces, and its population as of 2008 is just over 1 million. Located in the north central part of the country, the city is at an elevation of about 1310 m in a valley on the Tuul River. The city is the country's center for culture, industry and finance, and since it is more than 13 times bigger than the second largest city in Mongolia, Erdenet, it is the country's primate city. Ulaanbaatar is connected by highway to all the major towns in Mongolia and by rail to the Trans-Siberian Railway and Chinese railroad network. The city was founded in 1639 as a Buddhist monastery center and, in the 20th century, grew into a major manufacturing center.\nNames.\nUlaanbaatar has had many names in its history. From 1639\u20131706, it was known as \u00d6rg\u00f6\u00f6 (Mongolian: \u04e8\u0440\u0433\u04e9\u04e9, \"residence\"), and from 1706\u20131911 as Ikh Kh\u00fcree (Mongolian: \u0418\u0445 = \"great\", \u0425\u04af\u0440\u044d\u044d = \"camp\"), Da Kh\u00fcree or simply Kh\u00fcree. Upon independence in 1911,the city's name changed to Niislel Kh\u00fcree (Mongolian: \u041d\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043b\u044d\u043b = \"capital\", \u0425\u04af\u0440\u044d\u044d = \"camp\"). When the city became the capital of the new Mongolian People's Republic in 1924, its name was changed to Ulaanbaatar, literally \"red hero\", in honour of Mongolia's national hero Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar, that liberated Mongolia from Ungern von Sternberg's troops and Chinese occupation with the Soviet Red Army. In Europe and North America, Ulaanbaatar was generally known as Urga (from \"\u00d6rg\u00f6\u00f6\") or sometimes \"Kuren\" (from \"Kh\u00fcree\") or \"Kulun\" (from \u5eab\u502b, the Chinese transcription of \"Kh\u00fcree\") before 1924.\nGeography.\nUlaanbaatar is at about 1350 meters (4430\u00a0ft) above sea level. For this high elevation, and for the high latitude, and location hundreds of kilometres from any coast, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest national capital in the world, with a subarctic climate.\nHistory.\nMost important events:\n- 1639: The city was Founded.\n- 1778: the city settled for good at its current location, near the confluence of the Selbe and Tuul rivers and beneath Bogd Khan Uul, back then also on the caravan route from Beijing to Kyakhta.\n- 1911: Mongolian leaders in Ikh Kh\u00fcree for Naadam met in secret and resolved upon independence from China for their country.

Now the biggest cinema is Urguu and Tengis cinema. Main shopping district is 3rd and 4th distirict.\n- 2008, Ulaanbaatar was the scene of riots after the opposition Mongolian Democratic Party protested its defeat by the MPRP in parliamentary elections.\nAdministration and subdivisions.\nUlaanbaatar is divided into nine districts (D\u00fc\u00fcregs): Baganuur, Bagakhangai, Bayangol, Bayanz\u00fcrkh, Chingeltei, Khan Uul, Nalaikh, Songino Khairkhan, and S\u00fckhbaatar. Each district is subdivided into Khoroos. The capital is governed by a city council (the Citizen's Representatives Hural) with forty members, elected every four years. The city council appoints the mayor. Ulaanbaatar is governed as an independent first-level subdivision of Mongolia, separate from T\u00f6v Aimag, the province that surrounds Ulaanbaatar.\nEducation.\nUlaanbaatar has several major universities:\nAnd a big library, The National Library of Mongolia.\nImportant places.\nMost important places in Ulaanbaatar:\n\"Choijin Lama Monastery\" and \"Gandantegchinlen Khiid Monastery\" are two of the very few in Mongolia to escape the destruction of Mongolian monasteries under Khorloogiin Choibalsan.\nUlaanbaatar has several museums dedicated to Mongolian history and culture.\nSymbols.\nThe official symbol of Ulaanbaatar is the , a mythical bird in both Buddhist and Hindu mythology called Khan Garuda or \"Khangar'd\" by Mongols.\nFlag.\nThe city\u2019s flag is sky blue with the arms in the center."}

Her story is told in the New Testament of the Bible. \nMary in the Bible.\nChristian beliefs about Mary are based on the Bible. The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke say that Mary was a young woman who was engaged to be married to a man called Joseph. The Gospel of Luke says that the angel Gabriel came to Mary to tell her that she would give birth to a son. The angel told Mary that she should call her son Jesus. The angel also said that Jesus would save people from their sins.\nMary asked the angel how she could be pregnant, since she was a virgin. The angel told her that God had made her pregnant through a miracle.\nIn the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin\u2019s name was Mary. And coming to her, he said, \u201cHail, favored one! The Lord is with you.\u201d But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. Then the angel said to her, \u201cDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,\u00a0and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\u201d But Mary said to the angel, \u201cHow can this be, since I have no relations with a man?\u201d And the angel said to her in reply, \u201cThe holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived\u00a0a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren; for nothing will be impossible for God.\u201d Mary said, \u201cBehold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.\u201d Then the angel departed from her.According to the law that Israelites follow, Joseph had the right to divorce Mary publicly, but he did not. In a dream Joseph was told that Mary was conceived by the Holy Spirit. \nAt this time, the Roman Emperor, Caesar Augustus, made a law that everyone in the Roman Empire had to pay a tax. Everyone had to go back to the town that their family came from, to have their name put on the tax lists. Joseph came from Bethlehem, which was called The City of David. So Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem. There, she gave birth to the baby, Jesus. She gave birth in an animal shed, because Mary and Joseph could not find a room to stay in.\nThirty-three years later, Jesus was killed by crucifixion. Many of Jesus' apostles were scared of the Roman soldiers and ran away. However, Mary stood by the cross and was with Jesus when he died. As he was dying, he told the young disciple John to care for Mary as if she was his own mother, and the words were \"Woman, this is your son. This is your mother\". On the third day after Jesus' death, Mary went to Jesus' tomb with other women. They saw that the stone was rolled away from the tomb, and his body was gone. An angel told the women that Jesus had risen and was alive (see: Book of John, in end pages).\nMary continued to meet with the early church after the Ascension of Jesus. (Acts 1:14)\nGiving honor to Mary.\nMary is given honor in the Christian faith. She is especially honored as \"the Mother of God\" in the Roman Catholic Church. She is also honored as \"Theotokos\" (roughly translated as \"the one who gave birth to God\") in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Christianity, Jesus is thought to be both fully God and fully man. \nChristians do not worship Mary, because they believe that only God should be worshipped. However, some Christians - mainly Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians- venerate her, which means they pray to her and respect her acceptance of God's will by willingly giving birth to Jesus.\nMary is also given honor by Muslim(s) because the Qur'an says that she was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus. Muslims honor Jesus as a great prophet. \nMary is often called \"the Blessed Virgin Mary\" by Roman Catholics. There are many feast days which honor the Virgin Mary. For example, the \"Nativity of the Blessed Virgin\" on 8 September remembers her birth. Catholics also celebrate the Immaculate Conception, and Mary as Queen of Heaven on August 22.\nChristian art often shows the Virgin Mary. Many paintings show Mary with the baby Jesus. These paintings are known as Madonna and Child pictures. \nMany people who pray through Mary use a prayer called the Hail Mary. The first part of the prayer honors Mary: \"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\" The second part of the prayer asks for Mary's help: \"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our deaths. Amen.\"\nProtestants believe Roman Catholics and Orthodox give Mary too much honor"}

Secret areas will usually have something that helps the player win the level, like extra health or ammo. The player always has two weapons: the axe and the shotgun. More weapons can be found in the levels, including the nailgun, super nailgun, super shotgun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and the thunderbolt.\nThe levels are grouped together into different episodes, and each episode has a different setting. Most levels look very Gothic or medieval, but others look more futuristic, like science fiction. There are 6 or 7 levels in each episode, but every episode also has one secret level. There is also one level that is not inside of an episode, which is the final boss level. There are four episodes in the game, and they can be finished in any order the player wants. The player can't get to the final boss without beating all four episodes, though.\nThe game has four difficulty settings: easy, medium, hard, and nightmare. Nightmare difficulty can only be found in a secret area which is on the episode selection level. This secret area can be found in the episode 4 selection room."}

The goal in Zen is to attain \"satori\". This Japanese word translates as \"enlightenment\". The practice also includes using riddles, called Koans. Koans are also designed to help the practitioner not just engage in rational thought. The traditional Japanese place to learn Zen is a Zen monastery. \nJapanese Zen scholars such as D.T. Suzuki became well known in the West. Suzuki spent over fifty years teaching Zen to the world with a series of books in English. In the 1960s in California, Aldous Huxley, Alan Watts, and others promoted the philosophy. From there it spread to many parts of the western world. Zen is now well established outside of Japan and China. Many Zen centers exist in the US and Europe.\nZen is now associated with some design styles, like Minimalism. The Japanese gardens found at Zen monasteries in Japan are an example of this style. They are called Zen rock gardens. They are not directly part of the teachings of Zen."}

Scots is very different from the Scottish Gaelic language, which is a Celtic language.\nThere have been disagreements about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots. Focused broad Scots is at one end of a scale, with Scottish Standard English at the other. Scots is generally regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English, and has its own distinct variants such as Doric.\nHistory.\nNorthumbrian Old English was established in what is now southeastern Scotland as far as the River Forth by the seventh century. The region was part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Early Scots began to diverge from Northumbrian English in the twelfth and thirteenth century. There was immigration of Scandinavian-influenced Middle English-speakers from the North and Midlands of England.\nLater influences on the development of Scots were from Romance languages via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman and later Parisian French from the Auld Alliance and Dutch and Middle Low German influences by trade and immigration from the Low Countries. Scots also includes loanwords from contact with Gaelic.\nFrom the 13th century, Early Scots spread further into Scotland through the burghs established by King David I. The growth in prestige of Early Scots in the 14th century and the decline of French in Scotland made Scots the prestige dialect in most of eastern Scotland.\nFrom 1610 to the 1690s, during the Plantation of Ulster, many Scots-speaking Lowlanders, about 200,000, settled there. In the core areas of Scots settlement, there were five or six times as many Scots as English settlers. Southern Modern English was adopted as the literary language after 1700, and \"Modern Scots\" is sometimes used to describe the spoken language after 1700."}

It is often shortened to analysis. It looks at functions, sequences and series. These have useful properties and characteristics that can be used in engineering. Mathematical analysis provides a rigorous logical foundation to calculus, which studies continuous functions, differentiation and integration. Mathematical analysis is a short version of its old name \"infinitesimal analysis\", with some of its key subfields including real analysis, complex analysis, differentiation equation and functional analysis.\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Isaac Newton developed most of the basis of mathematical analysis. \nParts of mathematical analysis.\nLimits.\nA foundational concept in mathematical analysis is the concept of limit. Limits are used to see what happens very close to things. Limits can also be used to see what happens when things get very big. For example, formula_1 is never zero, but as \"n\" gets bigger, formula_1 gets closer and closer to zero. The limit of formula_1 as \"n\" gets bigger is zero. This is described by \"The limit of formula_1 as \"n\" goes to infinity is zero\", and written as formula_5.\nThe counterpart would be formula_6. When the formula_7 gets bigger, the limit goes to infinity. It is written as formula_8.\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra can be proven from some basic results in complex analysis. It says that every polynomial formula_9 with real or complex coefficients has a complex root (where a root is a number \"x\" satisfying the equation formula_10, and some of these roots may be the same).\nDifferential calculus.\nThe function formula_11 is a line. The formula_12 shows the slope of the function and the formula_13 shows the position of the function on the ordinate. With two points on the line, it is possible to calculate the slope formula_12 with:\nformula_15.\nA function of the form formula_16, which is not linear, cannot be calculated like above. It is only possible to calculate the slope by using tangents and secants. The secant passes through two points and when the two points get closer, it turns into a tangent.\nThe new formula is formula_17.\nThis is called difference quotient. The formula_18 gets now closer to formula_19. This can be expressed with the following formula:\nformula_20.\nThe result is called derivative or slope of f at the point formula_21.\nIntegration.\nThe integration is about the calculation of areas.\nThe symbol formula_22\nis read as \"the integral of \"f\" with respect to \"x\" from \"a\" to \"b\"\", and refers to the area between the x-axis, the graph of function \"f\", and the lines \"x\"=\"a\" and \"x\"=\"b\". The formula_23 is the point where the area should start, and the formula_24 where the area should ends."}

They do a lot of damage to the places where they pass, by eating the crops.\nThese are species which breed rapidly under suitable conditions. The migratory locust is the best-known example. They become gregarious and migratory when their populations become dense enough. They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adults. Both the bands and the swarms are nomadic and rapidly strip fields and greatly damage crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming practically all green material wherever the swarm settles.\nThe origin and apparent extinction of certain species of locust\u2014some of which grew to in length\u2014are unclear.\nLocusts are edible insects, and are considered a delicacy in some countries.

Species which change colour and behaviour at high population densities are called locusts.\nGrasshoppers prefer to eat grasses, leaves and cereal crops, but many grasshoppers are omnivorous. Many grasshoppers eat from several host plants in one day, while others stay on one host plant. One of the 8000 species of grasshopper eats only a single species of plant.\nAs food.\nGrasshoppers make good food for some. As an example, in southern Mexico, \"chapulines\" (grasshoppers of the genus \"Sphenarium\") are often eaten. They are high in protein, minerals and vitamins. \nThey are usually collected at dusk, using lamps or electric lighting, in sweep nets. Sometimes they are placed in water for 24 hours, after which they can be boiled or eaten raw, sun-dried, fried, flavoured with spices, such as garlic, onions, chilli, drenched in lime, and used in soup or as a filling for various dishes. They are abundant in Central and Southern Mexican food and street markets."}

The infinitive is the un-conjugated form of the verb, literally the \"to do\" something form such as \"to\" walk, \"to\" play, \"to\" eat. In English one does not say \"I like eat\" one must say \"I like \"to\" eat\". In both English and French (\"J'aime \"manger\"\") the infinitive form of the verb would be used in this case.\nThe pattern here is that the \"er\" is removed from the verb and replaced with a different ending depending on the subject(who's doing the eating).

She was good at what she did, and she claimed that her skill was greater than that of Athena. Athena was the young Greek goddess of weaving (amongst other things). \nAthena appeared to the girl as an old woman, and warned her not to offend the gods. Arachne did not take the advice, she wanted a weaving contest to prove her skill. \nAthena revealed herself, and let the contest begin. Athena wove her scene where she won over Poseidon, the god of the sea. Arachne wove scenes about Zeus being unfaithful, with different women: Leda, Europa, and Danae.\nAthena saw Arachne's work was without error, but she did not like the subject of Arachne's weaving. Athena lost her temper, and destroyed what Arachne had created. She also hit Arachne on the head. Arachne then realized what she had done. She ran away and hanged herself.

If they cannot avoid that thing, they will suffer from very strong anxiety which can damage their social relationships, their ability to work, and other areas of their everyday life.\nThere are two basic types of phobias: specific phobias and social phobias.

STDs can spread through oral sex or anal sex, or when two people's genitals touch. Today, STDs are usually called sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In the past, they were called venereal diseases (VD).\nSTDs can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Examples of the most common STDs are listed on this page.\nTypes of STDs.\nSTDs caused by viruses.\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\nHIV causes the immune system - the system in the body that is supposed to fight off infection - to not work as well as it should. This makes people with HIV more likely to get infections and some other diseases, like some cancers. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV).\nThere are about 40 different kinds of HPV that can be spread through sex and affect the anus and genitals. Examples of diseases that HPV can cause include:\nHepatitis viruses.\nHepatitis is an infection of the liver. There are three common types of hepatitis: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\nHepatitis A causes a short-term liver infection. It can be spread by having sex, though this is not the most common way to get hepatitis A.\nHepatitis B and hepatitis C cause much more serious, long-lasting liver problems. Both can cause very bad liver disease, like cirrhosis, and death. They are more likely than hepatitis A to be spread by having sex.\nHerpex simplex virus.\nThe herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes genital herpes. Genital herpes can cause painful blisters on the genitals and anus. Herpes can also cause sores on the mouth.\nThere is no cure for herpes.\nSTDs caused by bacteria.\nChlamydia.\nChlamydia is one of the common STDs in the world. In humans, it is the most common STD caused by bacteria. In the United States alone, about 2.8 million more people get chlamydia infection every year.\nIf chlamydia is not treated, it can cause serious problems, like diseases of the genitals and eyes. It can even cause blindness. Chlamydia can also cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system if it is not treated.\nGonorrhea.\nGonorrhea can infect the genitals, rectum, mouth, throat, and eyes. In bad cases, it can spread through the blood to infect the body's joints. In the worst cases, it can spread through the blood and infect the heart (causing endocarditis, an infection of the heart's valves) or the spinal cord (causing meningitis).\nSyphilis.\nSyphilis can cause many serious problems if it is not treated. It makes a person much more likely to get HIV, because it causes sores on the genitals that make it easier for HIV (and other STDs) to get spread. After a few years, if people with syphilis do not get treated, they can have serious problems with the organs in their body. Eventually - without treatment - syphilis infects the brain and causes death.\nSTDs caused by parasites.\nTrichomoniasis.\nTrichomoniasis is the most common STD in the world that is not caused by a virus. It can cause inflammation swelling of the vagina (vaginitis, urethra (urethritis), or penis. It can also cause more serious problems. If it is not treated, it can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. It can also cause prostate cancer, and makes a woman more likely to give birth to a premature baby.\nPrevention.\nThe only way for a person to be sure they will not get an STI is for that person not to have sex. This includes sex of any kind.\nThere are some things that a person can do to make it less likely to get an STI:"}

The rest disappear into the dry soil. \nThe Atacama is a desert not because mountains make a rain shadow, but because the ocean does. The water on the west part of Chile is quite cold, because it came from Antarctica. Moisture cannot stay in the cold air above the cold water, so mainly fog reaches the land, but very little rain. The people of Chile have learned how to get water from the fog to help them live. They \"harvest\" the clouds by putting up plastic sheets with pans underneath. The fog collects on the plastic and drips into the pans, giving the people water for crops and drinking. In parts of this desert it has not rained for over 400 years. Even though the Atacama is the driest place in the world that does not mean it is the hottest. The Atacama Desert is actually a really cold place with temperatures ranging from 0 to 30 degrees.\nThree countries fought the War of the Pacific in the 1880s for control of the desert. They both wanted its Sodium nitrate mines. Chile won.\nThe oldest known artificially prepared mummies come from this desert. They are called the Chinchorro mummies."}

Ebert's reviews appear in newspapers such as the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" from April 3, 1967 until his death.\nEbert was born on June 18, 1942 in Urbana, Illinois to a Catholic family.\nEbert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped make nationally-televised movie reviewing popular. They co-hosted the PBS show \"Sneak Previews\". It was followed by \"At the Movies\" which made both of them popular across the country. The two fought and made jokes while talking about movies. They created and trademarked the phrase \"Two Thumbs Up,\" used when both hosts thought the same movie was very good. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper.\nEbert lived with thyroid cancer since its diagnosis in 2002. He continued to publish his reviews both online and in print until April 2, 2013. Just two days later, on April 4, 2013, Ebert died from the disease in Chicago, Illinois. He was 70 years old.\nEarly life.\nEbert was born Roger Joseph Ebert on June 18, 1942 in Urbana, Illinois. His parents were Annabel (n\u00e9e Stumm) and Walter H. Ebert. His ancestry was German, Dutch, and Irish. He was raised Roman Catholic, attending St. Mary's elementary school and serving as an altarboy in Urbana. Ebert studied at Urbana High School, at the University of Chicago, and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Ebert was raised in Chicago, Illinois.\nCareer.\nEbert began his professional critic career in 1967, writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". That same year, Ebert's first book, a history of the University of Illinois titled \"Illini Century: One Hundred Years of Campus Life\", was published by the University's press.\nIn 1969, his review of \"Night of the Living Dead\" was published in \"Reader's Digest\".\nWorking with Russ Meyer.\nEbert co-wrote the screenplay for the 1970 Russ Meyer movie \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" and likes to joke about being responsible for the movie, which was poorly received on its release but is now regarded as a cult classic. Ebert and Meyer also made \"Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens\", \"Up!\", and others, and were involved in the ill-fated Sex Pistols movie \"Who Killed Bambi?\" In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of \"Who Killed Bambi?\" aka \"Anarchy in the UK\" on his blog.\nFrom the 1970s, Ebert worked for the University of Chicago as a guest lecturer, teaching a night class on movies. His fall 2005 class was on the works of the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder.\nWorking with Gene Siskel.\nIn 1975, Ebert and Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" began co-hosting a weekly movie review television show, \"Sneak Previews\", which was locally produced by the Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW. The show was picked up by PBS in 1978 for national distribution. In 1982, the critics moved to a television program named \"At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert\", and in 1986 they left to create \"Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; The Movies\" with Buena Vista Television (part of the Walt Disney Company).\nThe duo was known for their \"thumbs up/thumbs down\" review summaries. When Siskel died in 1999, the producers retitled the show \"Roger Ebert &amp; the Movies\" with rotating co-hosts. In September 2000, fellow \"Chicago Sun-Times\" columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed \"At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper\".\nTelevision show.\nEbert was the co-host of the television show \"Ebert and Roeper\" (originally \"Siskel and Ebert\"), where he and another critic, originally Gene Siskel (1946-1999) and after Siskel's death, Richard Roeper, appear in and talk about new movies.\nHis name stayed in the title, but Ebert did not appear on the show after mid-2006, because of problems after surgery for thyroid cancer which left him unable to speak.\nEbert ended his association with the show in July 2008, but in February 2009 he said that he and Roeper would continue their work on a new show. Ebert was on a show called, \"Ebert Presents at the Movies\", premiered on January 21, 2011, with Ebert appearing in a brief segment called \"Roger's Office\".\nOn September 13, 2013, it was announced that fellow co-star critic Richard Roeper was to replace Ebert as the main movie critic for the Chicago Sun-Times.\nMovie taste.\nEbert said that his favorite movie was \"Citizen Kane\", joking, \"That's the official answer\", although he liked to keep saying it as \"the most important\" movie. He kept saying that his real favorite movie was \"La Dolce Vita\". His favorite actor was Robert Mitchum, and his favorite actress was Ingrid Bergman. He expressed his general dislikes for \"top ten\" lists, and all movie lists in general, but contributed a top ten list to the 2012 Sight and Sound Critics' poll. Listed alphabetically, those movies were \"\"; \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\"; \"Apocalypse Now\"; \"Citizen Kane\"; \"La Dolce Vita\"; \"The General\"; \"Raging Bull\"; \"Tokyo Story\"; \"The Tree of Life\"; and \"Vertigo\".\nEbert compiled \"best of the year\" movie lists beginning in the 1960s, thereby helping provide an overview of his critical preferences. His top choices were:\nEbert revisited and sometimes revised his opinions. After ranking \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" third on his 1982 list, it was the only movie from that year to appear on his later \"Best Films of the 1980s\" list (where it also ranked third). He made similar revaluations of 1981's \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", and 1985's \"Ran\". \"The Three Colors trilogy\" (', ', and \"\"), and \"Pulp Fiction\" originally ranked second and third on Ebert's 1994 list; both were included on his \"Best Films of the 1990s\" list, but their order had reversed.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1975 Ebert became the first movie critic to win a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. In 2005, Ebert became the first movie critic to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ebert's home town of Champaign, Illinois are trying to raise money for a statue in Ebert's honor.\nIn July 2014, a documentary about Ebert's life, \"Life Itself\", was released to very positive reviews.\nPersonal life.\nEbert was married to Chaz Hammelsmith from July 18, 1992 until his death in 2013. They had no children. Ebert lived with Chaz in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois. He was a supporter for the Democratic Party. Ebert was an agnostic. On April 25, 2011, he accomplished one of his long-time goals: winning one of the weekly caption contests in \"The New Yorker\" after more than 100 tries. Ebert's personal net worth was U.S. $9 million.\nCancer.\nIn early 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. In February, surgeons at Northwestern Memorial Hospital successfully removed the cancer with clean margins. He later underwent surgery in 2003 for cancer in his salivary gland, and in December of that year, underwent a four-week follow-up course of radiation to his salivary glands, which altered his voice slightly. Ebert continued to be a dedicated critic of film, not missing a single opening while undergoing treatment. The cancer would eventually lead Ebert to be left in a wheelchair and unable to speak after having the total of three surgeries. Later on, experts created a translator that allowed Ebert to speak whatever he typed. He called his machine \"Sir Olivier,\" because he thought its voice sounded like actor Laurence Olivier.\nFalls.\nOn April 18, 2008, it was announced that Ebert had fractured his hip in a fall, a result of the weakening of his body following the unsuccessful tissue transplants, and had undergone surgery to repair it. In December 2012, Ebert was hospitalized with a fractured hip, which his wife Chaz jokingly blamed on \"tricky disco dance moves\".\nDeath.\nOn April 4, 2013, Ebert died of cancer at age 70 at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago according to the Chicago Sun-Times. His wife Chaz said that \"We were getting ready to go home today for hospice care, when he [Ebert] looked at us, smiled, and passed away.\" He battled cancer for 11 years. The closing sentence on his final blog post, two days before his death, said, \"So on this day of reflection I say again, thank you for going on this journey with me. I'll see you at the movies.\"\nFuneral.\nHundreds attended including Pat Quinn, Rahm Emanuel, and Richard Roeper in the April 8, 2013 funeral Mass held at Chicago's Holy Name Cathedral, where Ebert was celebrated as a film critic, newspaperman, advocate for social justice, husband and father. In his eulogy, the Rev. John F. Costello sought to dispel the notion that Ebert was an either non-believer, or agnostic, by invoking the movie \"The Hours\" and its observations on lives cut short; and saying that Ebert, raised Catholic, wrestled with \"the mystery of faith\" not as someone who rejected God but, rather, as someone forever seeking further understanding. Father Michael Pfleger concluded the service with: \"the balconies of heaven are filled with angels singing `thumbs up.'\" Ebert was later buried at the Graceland Cemetery in Chicago's north side.\nA 2-hour-and-45-minute public tribute, entitled \"Roger Ebert: A Celebration of Life\", was held at 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 11, 2013 at the Chicago Theatre. It featured in-person remembrances, video testimonials, video and film clips, gospel choirs, and was, according to the \"Chicago Tribune\"'s Mark Caro, \"a laughter- and sorrow-filled send-off from the entertainment and media worlds.\"\nReactions.\nEbert's death prompted wide reaction from celebrities both in and out of the entertainment industry. President Barack Obama wrote, \"Roger was the movies\u00a0... [he could capture] the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical\u00a0... The movies won't be the same without Roger\". Robert Redford called Ebert \"one of the great champions of freedom of artistic expression\" and said \"His personal passion for cinema was boundless, and that is sure to be his legacy for generations to come.\" Oprah Winfrey called Ebert's death the \"end of an era\", as did Steven Spielberg, who also said that Ebert's \"reviews went far deeper than simply thumbs up or thumbs down. He wrote with passion through a real knowledge of film and film history, and in doing so, helped many movies find their audiences... [he] put television criticism on the map\"."}

{"id": "23558", "revid": "7538800", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23558", "title": "Russian Revolution", "text": "The Russian Revolution was a series of revolutions in the Russian Empire during 1917. The events destroyed the Tsarist autocracy, and helped to create the Soviet Union. \nThe first revolution was on 8 March 1917, but in Russia it was recorded as 28 February 1917. This happened because Russia still used the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar, which is what we use for measuring dates today. After the February Revolution, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to step down and was replaced with a socialist provisional government. This government was meant to rule for a short time until the country became stable again. \nThe second revolution, the October Revolution, was in October of the Julian calendar. Communist Bolsheviks replaced the provisional government, and created the Soviet Union. The royal family was put under house arrest, but later shot and killed. The term \"Red October\" is used to describe the events of this month.\nBackground Of The Revolution.\nDuring the 1890s, improvements in Russian industry put more jobs in cities. This made the cities larger as people moved there. The workers in the cities, with increasing levels of education, began to develop an interest in politics and the creation of political parties in order to try and change their lives for the better. The conditions that they lived and worked in were horrible. Poor people from other parts of the Russian Empire, like Poland and Ukraine, also created their own parties to try and stop the Russians oppressing them.\nThis added to the people's anger, and after the Tsar's guards fired at a peaceful protest of workers, a rebellion began. It did not really change anything, but it meant that Nicholas promised to create an elected Parliament, or Duma.\nThe Duma was elected for the first time in March 1906. However, there were both left-wing and right-wing opponents to it, including socialists and people who were very loyal to the Tsar. There were also arguments over whether or not to take power from the Tsar and give it to more ordinary people. Nicholas eventually stopped the Duma three times, and because that meant they could not say anything against Nicholas, people became angry.\nIn 1914, Russia joined World War I. At first, people thought this was a good decision, and the country was united by patriotism. But there were huge problems with supplies, and by 1915 many soldiers were being sent to fight without any guns. Communication was bad, and Army officers argued a lot. That meant that they did not make plans well. The soldiers became unhappy, and over 3,000,000 Russians died. St. Petersburg was also renamed to Petrograd by the tsar in 1914 because he thought St. Petersburg sounds too German, especially for a capital.\nIn 1915, the Tsar took personal control of the Russian Army, and moved to the Army headquarters. This was a mistake. Not only did he not improve the situation, he began to be blamed for it. The fact that he was not near the government also meant that his wife Queen Alexandra was left in charge. Whenever the Duma tried to warn her that the people were angry, she would say they were lying, so she would ignore them. She even ignored a report by the secret police, the Okhrana, which said that a revolution might happen if things did not get better for ordinary people.\nThe February Revolution.\nThe first revolution began with a series of strikes in early February 1917. People in food queues in Petrograd, began a demonstration. They were joined by thousands of women, who left the fabrics factories where they worked. The strike spread through the capital. By February 25, most of St. Petersburg's factories had to close.\nOn the evening of February 25, Nicholas II sent the chief of the army in Petrograd a telegram. It told him to use his soldiers to stop the strikes. The army chief did that, but the soldiers joined the workers instead of stopping them. The police also joined them. The government's power collapsed.\nOn March 15, Nicholas abdicated. The control of Russia was given to a socialist provisional (temporary) government.\nConditions from February to October.\nAfter the February Revolution, the Provisional Government was challenged by a large group of workers in St. Petersburg - the Petrograd Soviet. The Government leader, Alexander Kerensky, tried to improve things by allowing freedom of speech and letting political prisoners go, but people were becoming more unhappy. There was not enough food. Wages went down. The national debt grew to 10 million rubles.\nVladimir Lenin arrived in Petrograd in April 1917. He was a Communist while the provisional government was Socialist. He had been exiled to Switzerland by the Tsar, but the Provisional Government had allowed him to come back. He began to lead a Communist group called the Bolsheviks.\nIn July, the Bolsheviks spent four days demonstrating against the Government. The military attacked them. Lenin was forced to escape to Finland until August, when the Bolsheviks were asked to help defend the government against a takeover by the army. The result of this was that their reputation improved. The government gave them weapons.\nThe Provisional Government's reputation kept getting worse as time went on. The Bolsheviks' reputation got better because they refused to work with them until both sides could compromise.\nOctober Revolution.\nOn October 10, the Bolshevik's Central Committee voted to start a revolution. One began in Estonia on October 23. Another started in St. Petersburg two days later. This time the revolution was mostly peaceful. The Bolsheviks' Red Army took over many government buildings without a fight - only two people were killed. It ended with the takeover of the Tsar's old Winter Palace on the morning of October 26, when the Provisional Government was arrested.\nThe Soviets took power and formed a Congress (a new Government) which began on October 25. Some members who were not Bolsheviks walked out during its first few meetings, but this made little difference to its decisions. The people who left were taunted by Leon Trotsky on their way out. He told them to go \"where you belong... the dustbin of history!\" All parties who opposed the Bolsheviks were eventually broken up, and their leaders were arrested.\nThe Congress began to get rid of private property. This meant that all land and money was to be owned by the people, and control of factories was given to their workers.\nThe Aftermath.\nSeveral countries that had been in the Russian Empire before the Revolution, such as Estonia and the Ukraine, had been asking for independence since February. As the new government formed they declared independence, and were allowed it.\nIn Russia, the revolution was severely challenged by countries that were not Communist and by the invading White Armies. In July 1918, countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and France sent more than 15 armies to fight the Bolsheviks. The ex-Tsar and his family were shot to stop them from being freed by the White Armies. In order to win the war, Lenin began a plan to divert food and supplies to the Communist Army. The plan worked. The Bolsheviks won the war, but the lack of food meant that between 3 and 10 million people died of hunger.\nThe Third Russian Revolution was an anarchist revolution against the Bolsheviks and the White Army. It lasted from 1918 to 1922.\nSome European countries recognized the Soviet Union as a proper country in the early 1920s. The United States refused to until 1933."}

Usually, they are made of white bread. Baguettes usually have a hard crust on the outside but soft white bread on the inside.\nFrench traditions say that bread may only contain the following four things: flour, water, yeast and salt. Anything containing more than those things must not be called bread.\nA baguette is about 5-6 cm wide, 3 to 4 cm high, and about 65 cm long. Such a baguette usually weighs about 250 grams. It is common to dip the bread into olive oil when it is eaten. \nHistory.\nThe baguette is thought as to have come from France, but it actually came from Vienna. In the middle of the nineteenth century, steam ovens had just been brought into use. This allowed loaves to be made with a crispy crust and the white centre, similar to today's baguettes. \nLater, in 1920, a law was passed that did not let bakers work before 4am. This made it impossible to make a larger loaf in time for their customers' breakfasts. The longer, thinner baguette helped solve this problem because it could be prepared and baked much faster. However, since the French had been making long thin loaves for a long time, what exactly was invented in 1920? It seems to be just the use of the word \"baguette\" for those thin loaves.\nDescription.\nOutside France, the baguette is also called a 'French stick'. It is a loaf of bread, up to a metre long but only about four to five centimetres in diameter. The baguette is a symbol of France.\nBaguettes are eaten as a sandwich cut in half lengthwise. They are also eaten for breakfast (usually with jam or chocolate spread).\nA loaf the same length as a baguette but thicker (about 8-10 centimetres diameter) is known as 'pain'. A thin version of the baguette is called 'ficelle'. \nEven in France there is a difference between a traditional baguette and a 'supermarket' baguette.\nBaguette has the same texture as the Greek bread Tsoureki."}

The mercury barometer, the earliest barometer, was created by an Italian mathematician named Evangelista Torricelli in 1643. \nThey are used for measuring altitude, or height above the ground, such as the height of a mountain, and they were often used to measure altitude aboard a hot air balloon. Barometers are also used in modern aviation. Miners sometimes use them to determine the depth of a mine. The most used purpose of the barometer was measuring air pressure.

The paper was sold to Russia, the UK, and France. The company merged with the Finnish Rubber Company which wanted to use its hydroelectricity plant. After World War Two, Nokia bought a large part of the Finnish Cable Works. In 1967 the three companies joined to form the Nokia Group.\nThey began making electronic products, and for a few years early in the 21st century were the world's biggest maker of mobile phones. Some of its phones, such as the Nokia 1100 and 1110, have sold over 250 million units around the world, and a few others, like the Nokia 3210 and Nokia 3310, sold more than 100 million units.\nTimeline.\nIn 2011, Nokia and Microsoft began a partnership which created Nokia Lumia, a series of smartphones that use the Windows Phone operating system and was meant to replace Symbian as the OS on Nokia's smartphones. Not many of these phones were sold and because of this, Nokia was losing money. Finally, in 2013, Microsoft bought out Nokia's mobile phone business, which became a division of Microsoft called Microsoft Mobile. Microsoft continued to make feature phones with the Nokia brand, but began using the Microsoft brand for its Lumia smartphones. Nokia's other phones, including the Nokia X which used Android, were discontinued, or no longer made.\nNokia also bought the mapping company Navteq in 2011, and changed its name to HERE. Its apps were first available only on Windows Phone as part of the company's deal with Microsoft, but they later became available for Android and iOS. HERE was sold to Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler in 2015.\nAlso in 2011, Nokia started a music streaming service called MixRadio. It became part of Microsoft Mobile in 2014, was sold to a Japanese company in 2015, and was eventually shut down in 2016.\nIn 2013, Nokia bought out the share of its telecommunications division that was held by Siemens of Germany, and this division is now known as Nokia Networks. The French company Alcatel-Lucent was bought by Nokia and merged into Nokia Networks early in 2016, which also included taking over the famous Bell Labs.\nMicrosoft Mobile sold its feature phone business to HMD Global in 2016, which is licensing the Nokia brand for its own phones. They include the Android-based Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 6, and a new version of the popular Nokia 3310 made in 2000."}

Learning institutions can vary widely in what they expect from members of their faculty. Most expect faculty members to set up their own laboratories. They hire their own lab employees and obtain their own funding, often from more than one source. Academic researchers often compete for grants to fund research at their own university. The more money researchers can attract, the higher the prestige of that university.\nScientific research.\nThe scientific method is the usual way of doing this kind of research.

Vaccines for the seasonal flu virus is a common example.\nThe body system is normally tolerant of its own molecules, which don't trigger an attack. Autoimmune diseases are caused when this safeguard fails.\nThe first time that a new antigen comes into contact with the body the response of the immune system will be a complete immune response. During this first response, the antigen will cause antibodies to be made. \nThe next time the same antigen contacts the body, a full-scale immune response is not needed as the body already has a specific antibody available instantly for that antigen. \nVaccinations usually contain dead bacteria or antigen so the antibodies can recognise it later and make antibodies faster."}

It tells how much information there is in an event. In general, the more certain or deterministic the event is, the less information it will contain. More clearly stated, information is an increase in uncertainty or entropy. The concept of information entropy was created by mathematician Claude Shannon.\nInformation and its relationship to entropy can be modeled by:R = H(x) - Hy(x)\"The conditional entropy Hy(x) will, for convenience, be called the equivocation. It measures the average ambiguity of the received signal.\"\nThe \"average ambiguity\" or Hy(x) meaning uncertainty or entropy. H(x) represents information. R is the received signal.\nIt has applications in many areas, including lossless data compression, statistical inference, cryptography, and sometimes in other disciplines as biology, physics or machine learning.\nThe information gain is a measure of the probability with which a certain result is expected to happen. In the context of a coin flip, with a 50-50 probability, the entropy is the highest value of 1. It does not involve information gain because it does not incline towards a specific result more than the other. If there is a 100-0 probability that a result will occur, the entropy is 0.\nExample.\nLet's look at an example. If someone is told something they already know, the information they get is very small. It will be pointless for them to be told something they already know. This information would have very low entropy.\nIf they were told about something they knew little about, they would get much new information. This information would be very valuable to them. They would learn something. This information would have high entropy."}

As well, many utility companies such as telephone companies and electric companies place cones on the road when utility workers are working on or near the road. Cones are also used by driving schools to set up tests of turning and parking skills.\nThey have many other uses including bike training, fun and for personal use like reserving parking spaces.\nFeatures.\nTraffic cones are easily movable and about 60\u00a0cm (24 inches) tall. Traffic cones come in many different colors, with orange, yellow and red being the most common colors. Many types of traffic cones have reflective strips or stripes of reflective paint, so that the cones are easier to see at night.\nHistory.\nTraffic cones were invented in 1914 by Charles P. Rudabaker. The first cones were made of concrete. In the 2000s, most cones are made of brightly-colored plastic."}

Her books are very famous all over the world, and she sold more than 4 billion books around the world. Only William Shakespeare has sold more books. Also, her books are written in more languages than any other writer's books. People can read them in 103 different languages. Her stories are about murders and finding out who did them. It is hard to find that person. There is a detective who tries to catch the bad person. People like reading her books because they can try to find the answer, too. Reading these books is like playing a game. The most well-known characters in her books are Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot. Miss Marple is an old English lady, and she talks to everyone. People do not think she is smart, but she always finds the bad person. She uses logic to find out who is guilty of the murder. Hercule Poirot is a strange man, a private detective from Belgium who lives in London. He likes to find out who did the murder by thinking about all the evidence. The stories of Poirot and Miss Marple were made into many TV shows and movies.\nChristie also wrote plays. One of them is called \"The Mousetrap\", and it started over 60 years ago. It remains the world's longest-running play.\nChristie was born in Torquay in Devon, England. She did not go to school. She had lessons from her mother at home. Her mother thought children should not learn to read until they were eight years old. But Christie learned how to read by herself when she was four. She read many books, so she learned to become a good writer. She later became a very good pianist and singer, too. She was married twice; she had a daughter called Rosalind Hicks. She worked in a hospital and in a pharmacy during World War I. She also wrote romance novels and plays. They were very successful too. In 1971, she was honoured by the Queen with the title Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\nChristie died on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her Winterbrook House in the north of Cholsey parish, adjoining Wallingford in Oxfordshire (formerly part of Berkshire). She is buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey.\nThe \"Guinness Book of World Records\" ranks Christie as the best-selling novelist ever. Her novels have sold about 4 billion copies. Her works are the world's most-widely published books after those of William Shakespeare and the Bible. Her books have been translated into at least 103 languages. Christie's best-selling novel is \"And Then There Were None\". It has sold 100 million copies. It is the world's best-selling mystery novel."}

On March 6, 1957, after ten years of campaigning for Ghanaian independence, Nkrumah was elected President and Ghana gained independence from British rule.\nEarly life and activism.\nNkrumah was born Francis Nwia-Kofi Ngonloma in Nkroful, a town in Gold Coast (the British colony that was to become Ghana) to Kofi Ngonloma, a goldsmith, and Elizabeth Nyaniba, a salesperson, who he saw as a great inspiration.\nEducation.\nHe attended Elementary School at Half Assini where his father worked as a goldsmith. A German priest called George Fischer influenced his education. He went to a school for teachers in Accra, then became a teacher himself. In 1935 he went to Lincoln University in the United States. He learned more about Communism. His education continued at the University of Pennsylvania, from 1939 to 1943. In 1945 he went to London and organized an international conference for African freedom. At that time he changed his name to \"Kwame\".\nPresident of Ghana.\nNkrumah returned to the Gold Coast and founded the Convention People's Party. He was elected Prime Minister. When Ghana became independent from England, Nkrumah was its first president. He created the flag of Ghana. He required all children to attend school. More women attended school and took jobs.

{"id": "23635", "revid": "487619", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23635", "title": "Great Barrier Reef", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef. It is near the coast of Queensland, Australia. It is made up of nearly 2900 coral reefs and over 600 islands. It is 327,800\u00a0km2 big and 2600\u00a0km long. It has been listed an important World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest structure made by living things. It can be seen from outer space. The Reefs are threatened.\nThe biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef today is coral bleaching caused by high sea water temperatures as a result of global warming. During 2016, the worst die-off ever recorded occurred, due to seas warming around the Great Barrier Reef. Two-thirds of a 700-km (435 miles) stretch of coral in nine months were killed.\nGeology.\nThe Reef Research Centre has found the remains of coral that are half a million years old. Corals have been growing in the region for as long as 25 million years. The corals have not always formed coral reefs.\nIt is difficult to work out the age of the Great Barrier Reef. This is because of the way a reef can grow and shrink as the sea level changes. A coral reef can grow in diameter, that is how wide they are, from 1 to 2 cm per year. They can also grow upwards from 1 to 15\u00a0cm per year. Coral can not grow if the water is too deep (150 metres or more) because it needs light from the sun. They cannot grow out of the water (above sea level).\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and Australian Institute of Marine Science say the current, living reef started growing about 20,000 years ago. It started to grow on an older reef. This makes the beginning of the reef duringay. The land that forms the bottom of the Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain. The plain had some large hills. Some of these hills were parts of older reefs.\nFrom 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years the sea level began to rise. As it rose, the corals could grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain. 13,000 years ago the sea level was 60 metres lower than the present day. Corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain. These became continental islands. As the sea level rose higher, most of these continental islands were covered by water. The corals could then grow over the hills. This formed the present cays and reefs. Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen much in the last 6,000 years. The CRC Reef Research Centre has worked out that the present, living reef is 6,000 to 8,000 years old.\nThe remains of a very old barrier reef has been found in the Kimberley area. This is in the northern part of Western Australia.\nThe Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 different areas. These are called bioregions. Each bioregion has its own special plants and animals. There are 30 reef bioregions, and 40 are non-reef bioregions. In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef, there are ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs. These kinds of reef do not exist in the rest of the Great Barrier Reef system.\nEcology.\nThe Great Barrier Reef has 1,500 species of fish, and many other animals, algae, and corals. This includes many vulnerable or endangered species. Some of these exist only on this reef system.\nMammals.\nThirty species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises have been seen in the Great Barrier Reef. This includes the dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and the humpback whale. Most of the population of the dugongs live there.\nTurtles and Dugongs.\nSix species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed. These are the green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, flatback turtle, and the olive ridley. There are two different groups of green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef. One group lives in the northern part of the reef and the other in the south. Fifteen species of seagrass attract the dugongs and turtles. They also provide a food and shelter for fish. The most common kinds of seagrasses are \"Halophila\" and \"Halodule\".\nOther sea animals.\nSaltwater Crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef. No crocodile nests have been found on the reef. The salt water crocodiles on the reef travel long distances. There are not many living around the reef. Around 125 species of shark, stingray, skates or chimaera live on the reef. About 5,000 species of mollusc live on the reef. These include the giant clam, nudibranchs and cone snails. Forty-nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been found. Seven species of frogs live on the islands. Also, the Moray eel lives on the bottom, preying on fish.\nBirds.\n215 species of birds come to the reef or nest or roost on the islands. This includes 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds. These include the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern. Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef. About 1.7 million birds use the sites to breed.\nPlants.\nThe islands of the Great Barrier Reef have 2,195 known plant species. Three of these do not live anywhere else. The northern islands have 300-350 plants which are woody. The southern islands have 200 plants which are herbaceous. The Whitsunday region has the most plant species placing at 1,141. The plant species are mostly spread by fish\nSea snakes.\nSeventeen types of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef. They take about 4 years to become old enough to breed. They usually live on the sea floor. They live in warm waters up to deep. They are more common in the southern part of the reef.\nFish, ascidians and bryozoans.\nMore than 1,500 species of fish live on the reef. These include the clownfish, red bass, red-throat emperor, and several types of snapper and coral trout. There are at least 330 species of sea squirts (ascidians) on the reef. These vary in size from 1\u00a0mm-10\u00a0cm in diameter. Between 300 and 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef system. These are small water animals that look like moss, or\nbranches\nCorals.\nFour hundred species of corals, both hard corals and soft corals live on the reef. Most of these spawn, releasing thousands of eggs, in huge events. This spawning is controlled by the rising sea temperatures. This happens in spring, summer and some parts of autumn, as part of the moons lunar cycle, and the day/night diurnal cycle. Reefs in the inner Great Barrier Reef spawn during the week after the full moon in October. Outer reefs spawn in November and December. The common soft corals on the Great Barrier Reef belong to 36 different types. Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef. This includes thirteen types of \"Halimeda\". These deposit chalky (calcareous) mounds up to 100 metres wide. They have mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover.\nClimate change.\nA new report, the Reef Outlook Report, says that climate change will cause huge damage to the reef. The report was written by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Warmer and more acidic water around the coral reef will slow down calcification, which is how the coral grows and becomes strong. The corals will become bleached (lose their colours) and many species that live on and around the reef will be in danger. The Australian government has already spent AU$325 million to improve the health of the reef in the last two years.\nOther dangers.\nThe Reef Outlook Report also warned of other dangers to the reef. These included poor quality water running into the sea from the mainland. This water is polluted with farm insecticides and rubbish from nearby towns. The increasing amount of development on the coast is destroying natural marine and coastal habitats. There is also some damage from fishing."}

It was signed by President James Monroe and passed in 1820. The agreement was between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups in the United States Congress, mostly about the regulation of slavery in the western territories. It admitted Missouri as a slave state to please the South and it also admitted Maine as a free state to please the North. It kept the balance of power in the United States Senate between the free states and slave states. The plan also called for slavery to be banned from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36 degrees 30' north (also known as the Missouri Compromise Line), except inside the borders of the proposed state of Missouri.\nBefore the agreement, the House of Representatives had refused to accept this compromise and a conference committee was appointed. The United States Senate refused to concur in the amendment, and the whole measure was lost.\nDuring the following session (1819-1820), the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, created on January 26, 1820 by John W. Taylor of New York, allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state. In December, the question had been complicated by the admission in of Alabama, a slave state, making the number of slave and free states the same. Also, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3, 1820) to admit Maine as a free state.\nThe Senate decided to connect the two measures. It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment allowing the people of Missouri to make a state constitution. Before the bill returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois, excluding slavery from the Missouri Territory north of the parallel 36\u00b030' north (the southern boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri."}

It is a relative of the pheasant.\nThere are two species of peafowl: the Asiatic peafowl (\"Pavo\") or the Congo peafowl (\"Afropavo congensis\"). The Congo peafowl is the only member of the pheasant family that originated outside Asia.\nThe male peafowl can have up to 150 brightly colored feathers on its tail coverts.\nFor centuries peafowl have been admired for their beauty and hunted for their meat. Recently peacocks have become more popular in parks and gardens.Peacocks are large, colorful pheasants (typically blue and green) known for their iridescent tails. Distinctive Tail Feathers.\nMale peafowl.\nAppearance.\nThe male peafowls (called peacocks) have long, colorful feathers. Female peafowls (called peahens) have shorter, brown feathers. Male peafowl were initially called poococks, but this name was replaced as it was offensive to the LGBT community.\nHabits.\nEating habits.\nThey like to eat any kind of green shoots (flowers, veggies, grass etc.) as well as wheat, cracked corn or wild game feed. They can handle freezing temperatures as long as they have a dry perch that is out of the wind and weather. Dry dog and cat chows make excellent winter feed for peafowl, who are omnivores, eating insects, small snakes, lizards, grain, as well as many varieties of greens. They are particularly fond of petunias and similar pot plants, leaving nothing but a small green circle where the stem once emerged from the soil. The birds will learn to come to a specific place at specific times of day to be fed, and a regular light feeding during summer adapts them to coming to the feeding place in winter.\nOrigin.\nThe peafowl is native to southeast Asia, including India and Pakistan. They were brought to Europe long ago, and can acclimatize to colder areas.\nMating.\nThe very long, elegant and colorful plumage of the male birds, peacocks, is grown over the winter months so that they are ready for the early spring mating season, during which each male establishes a territory. The male calls to the females to come and admire his dance.\nHe displays a rustling of tail quills which hold up the fanned back plumes (= tail feathers) as he stamps and turns. The summoning call is loud, repeated, happens sometimes at night, and sounds, to some people, like a woman screaming. Often it is tri-syllabic, mi-fa-sol. Once the mating season is over, the tail feathers are naturally shed.\nThe peacock's display is a classic example of sexual selection.\nFemale peafowl.\nThe female birds, peahens, are soft brown and gray with white chests and bellies and some light green on the neck, the colors blending so well with weeds and grasses that when the female is nesting on the ground, she is almost invisible.\nMothering.\nThe hen teaches her chicks what to eat by putting her beak down at a chosen bug, grain, seed, or leaf and making a throaty \"grock\" sound. The chick put its beak against the mother's, follows the beak to the tip, and eats whatever it points at. The chicks can learn what to eat from a hen of another species, but, unlike baby chickens, peachicks need to be shown what to eat. Chicks hatched in a hatchery can starve to death if there is no hen to teach them what to eat.\nIn addition to the \"eat this\" sound, the female has a particular call for a missing chick, a \"where are you,\" \"hoo-hah\" call, two toned, high then low, mi-do, mi-do. When a chick is missing, this call can go on for hours.\nReproduction.\nShe lays from two to six eggs in the spring time and, once all are laid, sits on the eggs for about thirty days to hatch them, leaving the nest once or twice a day to feed and drink. Often the female will utter a shrieked \"trouble\" call, a quickly repeated \"cuk, cuk, cuk, cuk\" when she leaves the nest, to attract predators away from it.\nChicks.\nOnce the chicks are hatched, the mother leads them away from the broken eggs, as the smell of the eggs attracts predators. They are able to flutter a little within hours, and in a few days can fly up into sheltering trees by going first to lower branches and working their way higher, preferring high, protected branches. The chicks roost on either side of the peahen, and she extends her wings to cover them during the night, thus protecting them from rain, hail, and visits from owls. They begin to grow their \"crowns\" when they are only a few weeks old and it takes about a year for them to reach full size, though it may take three years to reach breeding age. Both males and females are hatched with the same plumage; nine to twelve months after hatching, the males' necks begin to turn peacock blue, and their splendid plumage takes about four years to reach full size."}

It is usually short (small in height), but long from front to back and with short legs. \u201cDachshund\u201d is a German word that is used in English, and it means \u201cbadger dog.\u201d (In German, dachshunds are called \"Dackel\" or \"Teckel\".)\nThe breed was developed to use its sense of smell to find, chase, and hunt badgers and other animals that live in holes. A dachshund has a long, narrow body, so it is sometimes called a \"wiener dog\", \"hot dog\", or \"sausage dog\". Some owners believe that using such terms is disrespectful, and may take offense.\nAppearance (looks).\nToday, dachshunds have crooked legs, loose skin, and a barrel-like chest. Over time, breeders selected dogs so that those features would appear in puppies. That way, dachshunds could do a better job of burrowing into tight spaces. Another feature is a long tail.\nThe coat or fur of a dachshund comes in three kinds \u2013 smooth or short-haired, long-haired, and wire-haired. The wire-haired dachshund usually is shorter front to back than the other two.\nSize.\nA fully-grown dachshund weighs between 16 and 28\u00a0lb. (7 to 12.7\u00a0kg), while the miniature dachshund may weigh less than 11\u00a0lb. (5\u00a0kg). The writer H. L. Mencken said that \u201cA dachshund is a half-dog high and a dog-and-a-half long.\u201d\nCoat and color.\nDachshund fur comes in many colours. The colors that are most common are red (a brown color that looks a little reddish) and black-and-tan (black body with brown parts). There are solid black and solid chocolate-brown dachshunds. Many people think those dachshunds are handsome, but the colors are not standard or official \u2013 that is, you cannot enter those dogs in some dog shows.\nTemperament (mood or emotions).\nDachshunds are playful, fun dogs. People know that dachshunds like to chase small animals and birds, and when they chase those animals they do it ferociously (without fear and very intensely). Many dachshunds are strong-headed or stubborn, and that means they can be hard to train. However; if trained in proper way and at an early age, these dogs can be a good family dogs. These dogs should be trained for socialization and obedience. Dachshunds are often very loyal to their owners (devoted to their owners, or very interested in their owners). In fact, they can be much more loyal than other kinds of dogs. But wire-haired dachshunds often do not show that kind of loyalty to their owners.\nPeople know that dachshunds have deep and tender eyes, and that dachshunds have many facial expressions (dachshunds can communicate just with the look on their faces).\nHealth.\nDachshunds often have spinal problems, that is, their backbone can become injured. That is because of the dog\u2019s very long spinal column and short rib cage. The problems are usually hereditary (genetic), that is, they are passed down from parent dogs to puppies.\nA dachshund that is obese (fat) can have a higher risk of getting injured. That is because the extra weight puts more strain on the backbone (vertebrae).\nTo prevent injury, dachshunds should not climb stairs or jump unless they really have to. It is also important to hold the dog the right way \u2013 by holding up the front and the rear parts of the body at all times.\nHistory.\nSome people have wondered if dachshunds go back to ancient Egypt. People have found drawings and engravings from ancient Egypt that show hunting dogs with short legs. But the dachshund of today was bred in Europe, and it has parts of German, French, and English hounds and terriers.\nKings and queens all over Europe have had dachshunds. Queen Victoria especially liked dachshunds."}

It is at least 2,500 years old and it comes from China. Taoism is now said to be a philosophy. Tao (or Dao, ) is the name of the force or the \"Way\" that Taoists believe makes everything in the world. Taoists think that words cannot be used to correctly describe Tao. The very first line of the \"D\u00e0o D\u00e9 J\u012bng\" (), the most important text in Taoism, says \"the Way that can be explained in words is not the true Way.\" There are many other sacred writings by the teachers of Taoism.\nInstead of spending a lot of time trying to explain what the Tao is, Taoists focus on living a simple and balanced life in harmony with nature. This is one of the most important principles in Taoism. Taoists also believe that conflict is not good and that if you have a problem with something, it is better to find a way around it.\nHistory.\nTaoism first showed up in writing in China about 2500 years ago. People do not always write about their religions at first, so this religion may be much older. Some important people of the history of Taoism are:\nBeliefs and practices.\nPeople who follow this religion believe that doing something with words, thoughts, symbolic actions, etc. can make things in the real world change. That idea is hard to understand. Here is an example: There is an old story that says China was once covered by a flood. The world was saved from the flood by \u79b9 Y\u01d4, who had only one leg that worked. Y\u01d4 went to different parts of China in a special order, and he dug ditches to let the flood water go into the ocean. When something very bad happens in the world, a Daoist priest can go to the Daoist temple and act out what Y\u01d4 did, and just doing that will make the world get fixed.\nDaoist priests do many other things. For instance, they can use fire and noise to scare demons away. They can do things to cure sickness. They can perform funerals and help keep the new ghosts safe from harm.\nIn Taoism it is assumed that opposites rely on each other to exist. For example, big and small. Or, Light and dark."}

Many people in different countries live in poverty, especially in developing areas of West and Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and some parts of Asia. \nThere are different ways to measure poverty. The World Bank says that \"extreme poverty\" is when someone has less than US$1 a day to live on (that dollar is an ideal one). It has been changed to rule out certain effects such as inflation, meaning that prices of things rise higher than what a person is paid, and other price level differences. \"Moderate poverty\" is when people have to live on less than $2 a day. In the year 2001, 1.1 billion people were seen as \"extremely poor\", and 2.7 billion were seen as \"moderately poor\". \nIn the developed world this does not apply. There, many people are seen as the \"working poor\". They have a job, but do not earn enough money for basic things such as food and a home. In most developed countries, people without jobs receive money from the government, but this is often less than they need for a comfortable life. \nThere are different ways to tell if a country is rich or poor. The Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and Human Development Index, or HDI, are two of those measures. Gross Domestic Product is the money made from trade from inside the country. \nHDI, meaning the Human Development Index is a different matter. It is determined by life expectancy and adult literacy rates. Places in Africa like Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Mali are the poorest, with Sierra Leone having the lowest HDI ranking in the world.\nPoverty is a hurdle in the way of a country's progress. One way of helping lower poverty is by educating poor people so that they can start contributing to a nation's economic development. Education teaches the poor about their rights and may show them the path to become an important part of the growth and expansion of the country. Vienna Declaration also tells this fact. \nOne of the most important things that is needed to make a country richer is for the Government to want to help poor people do better. Without this, it is hard for people to become better off.\n\u201cThe poor are starving and their hunger keeps them in poverty.\u201d a quote from Nathan Jones"}

At its height, it was the largest empire in history, and the world's most powerful superpower for more than a century. \nSlavery was used by European powers in the Americas, Britain included. Millions of black people were captured from Africa and forced to work in colonies of European empires. However, England was the first of the European powers to ban slavery, and used the Royal Navy to reinforce its ban. \nBy 1922, more than 458 million people lived in the British Empire, which was more than one fifth of the world's population at that time. The empire was larger than , almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area.p15 Since it was so large, the British Empire has left a large legal, linguistic and cultural heritage. Like the Spanish Empire before it, the British Empire was often said to be \"the empire on which the sun never sets\" because it was so large that the sun was always shining somewhere in the empire. The Empire controlled land on every inhabited continent.\nEngland, France, and the Netherlands began to make colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia.p2 England fought and won some wars in the 17th and 18th centuries against the Netherlands and France. After these wars, England (and then, after the union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain) became the main colonial power in North America and India.\nWhen Britain gave Hong Kong back to China on 1 July 1997, it marked the effective end of the British Empire. Britain still has some overseas territories.\nNew empire.\nWhen the Thirteen Colonies became independent in the American War of Independence, the British Empire lost some of its oldest and most important colonies. But it kept colonies in what are now Canada and Florida, as well as the Caribbean. It still had colonies and businesses in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific too. After defeating Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain became the world's only superpower for more than a century. The empire became even larger.\nThe empire continued to expand during the 19th century. The empire would force the Chinese to give them the island of Hong Kong following the Opium Wars during the middle of the 19th century. During the Scramble for Africa, Britain gained much of Africa, especially in the south.\nBy the start of the 20th century, the economies of Germany and the United States had begun catching up to Britain, especially in their industrialisation. Britain allowed Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to be \"self-governing dominions\" by the time of the First World War. They could create their own laws in most matters, and became independent countries in 1931.\nThe First World War weakened Europe. Though the British Empire had been the most powerful economy before the war, it was quickly surpassed by the United States as the greatest industrial power after the war. In the Second World War, Japan took the colonies of Britain and other European countries in South-East Asia. The allies eventually defeated Japan and took back their colonies, but Britain's prestige in Asia was damaged. This caused the empire to decline more quickly.\nThe British Raj included the whole of the Indian subcontinent. The independence of the two states of India and Pakistan in 1947 was the first and most important step in decolonisation. In the following decade, Britain also gave independence to most of the territories of the British Empire. While doing this, the colonial government hid and destroyed many documents about the empire that they thought might get them in trouble. After the UK transferred Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the British Empire was essentially over. However, Britain still controls some overseas territories. After they were given independence, many countries which used to be British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations. have the same head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, and are Commonwealth realms.\nAbolition of slavery.\nThe Slavery Abolition Act abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834. In the territories administered by the East India Company and Ceylon, slavery was ended in 1844. \nParliamentary reform in 1832 saw the influence of the East India Company decline. Under the 1833 Act, slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of four to six years of \"apprenticeship\". Facing further opposition from abolitionists, the apprenticeship system was abolished in 1838. \nThe British government compensated slave-owners."}

It carries people to places within a city. Because a single tram can carry many people at the same time, riding on a tram instead of driving a car is a good way to help prevent pollution and stop the roads getting too busy.\nThe word \"tram\" is used mainly outside North America, while within North America these vehicles are called \"streetcars\" or \"trolleys\" as they run mainly on streets.\nMore modern and larger trams manufactured since the 1970s, such as the one in the second picture from Warsaw, are called light rail vehicles. These vehicles are bigger because they are very often made of two or more parts, with a bendy section in the middle which works like a human joint. In railway jargon, these types of vehicles are called \"articulated\". These may sometimes have their own right-of-way instead of traveling on the street and their stops are usually farther apart than the stops of trams so that they can travel faster. \nOn Market Street in San Francisco, vintage streetcars from the 1910s through the 1940s, called \"historic streetcars\" (the \"F Market\" line), that travel on the street are a popular tourist attraction. Another city whose trams are highly used by tourists is Hong Kong, because here the trams have two floors which is very rare in the world.\nThe largest tram networks in the world are in: Melbourne, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, Berlin, Moscow and Vienna. \nHistory.\nTrams first came into use in the 1890s, when they replaced horsecars--streetcars drawn by horses.\nIn the 1910s to 1930s, in many metropolitan areas in North America, there were special bigger and longer streetcars that traveled long distances to distant suburbs on what were called \"interurban\" lines. These streetcar lines sometimes had \"dedicated tracks\" with their own right-of-way (land surrounding the tracks) and made fewer local stops. \nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, in the United States, there was a conspiracy by Standard Oil, General Motors, and Firestone Rubber. They formed a company called National City Lines to buy streetcar systems, tear up the tracks, and replace them with buses in almost all the cities in North America. They did this so they could make bigger profits by selling more oil, buses, cars and rubber tires. Because of this, it was necessary to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds in the 1980s and 1990s to reconstruct the streetcar systems as light rail systems using light rail vehicles. This conspiracy is somewhat referred to in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit."}

He is widely considered the greatest ragtime composer of all time.\nEarly life.\nJoplin was African-American and born in the U.S. state of Texas sometime between June 1867 and January 1868 and grew up in Texarkana, Texas. His relatives were railroad workers. His father wanted him to find work that would pay. His mother said he should learn music. Even though he was from Texas, most of his pieces were written when he was in Missouri and New York City.\nMusical career.\nJoplin is most well known for writing piano pieces called rags. His music became popular again in the 1970s, with the album \"Scott Joplin: Piano Rags\", performed by Joshua Rifkin, from Nonesuch Records. He may be most commonly known now by the Marvin Hamlisch adaptation of his composition \"The Entertainer\" (1902) which was used in the 1973 movie \"The Sting\" starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. His best-known song while he was alive was \"Maple Leaf Rag\" (1899). Other rags he wrote were \"The Ragtime Dance\" (1906) and \"Magnetic Rag\" (1914). Scott Joplin wrote more than 40 piano rags, but he also wrote two operas; \"A Guest of Honor\" and \"Treemonisha\". \"A Guest of Honor\" was performed in Joplin's lifetime, but since then the music has been lost. \"Treemonisha\" was never performed while Joplin was alive, but it has been performed since then. Joplin also wrote a symphony, but the music has been lost.\nDeath.\nJoplin died of syphilis in New York City on April 1, 1917.\nBibliography.\n\u2022 Gildo De Stefano, \"Ragtime, jazz &amp; dintorni\".

Nationalists think that the best way to make this happen and avoid control or oppression by others is for each group to have their own nation. Some nationalists think this is the best way to save small and weak groups threatened by the mixing of ethnic groups. The other definition of nationalism is the 'identification with one's own nation and support for its interests, especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations. Nationalism may refer to a state of the mind in respect of socio political phenomenon arising from it's consciousness shared by people (national) of a particular country or territory.\nThe opposite of nationalism is Internationalism and anti-nationalism.\nIn left-right politics.\nMany early socialists were also nationalists. The earliest forms of nationalism had lots of socialist features. In this period, political thinkers who thought that ethnic groups should not be oppressed by other ethnic groups thought also that 'normal folk', the backbone of society, like workers and peasants, should not be oppressed by higher social classes like rich people. They also thought that it is wrong for somebody to live in great welfare that is made of the hard work of others, or the oppression of others. The ideology is that the social classes should work together and have a common goal that aims for the good of everyone. These goals can be called \"national interest\". \nNational interest is ideal and not always easy to find. There are different ways to reach national interest, for example politics.\nNationalists started to support normal people, especially peasants, who were seen as uncorrupted, gallant, and fair, unlike high classes. For example, normal folks often had more original and local ethnic culture than the high classes, whose culture was seen more rootless. National Romanticism was based much on the ideal of uncorrupt folk.\nSocialism.\nSocialism and nationalism grew together. But they have also been placed in opposition in some theories. The most known opposition between these ideologies was with the Soviet Union. The Soviet propaganda made nationalism an insult word that was linked with opposed ideologies like capitalism, liberalism, imperialism or fascism. Still, even in the Soviet Union and other communist or socialist countries, there was nationalism in great measure (even if it was not called with that name). \nThe most capitalist countries like United States were patriotic rather than nationalist. The Nordic countries, which were among the most pure nation-states (countries that follow nationalist principle), were not very capitalist or rightist; they were built on the social democratic idea, which is left. Only after Nordic countries became more multicultural did their politics become more rightist.\nToday nationalism does not have a common stand on those fields of politics that are outside of its basic goals, like left-right politics. However nationalism can be a part of bigger political ideology or agenda that can be leftist or rightist or something outside that classification.\nNationalism is still usually connected to goals that resist strong hierarchy between social class different people in society. Nationalist people are usually more or less against the strongest forms of capitalism, which they think gives too much power to rich people and big companies.\nNationalism and imperialism.\nNationalism had an important role in ending the colonial rule. Nationalism spread to colonies and made their people desire independence. Nationalism also made the people in metropolitan states (countries that colonized others) accept more the desire of other people to rule themselves. However nationalists think that the end of colonization of Africa was not done well. They think that there would not be so many conflicts in Africa if African nations had built in a nationalist way (so that every ethnic group is its own nation). \nAfter the imperialists left their African colonies, the new nations were built with borders that were not the same as the ethnic borders. New nations became nations with many ethnic groups, which do not want to or cannot live peacefully in the same society with the others."}

It is often difficult to decide when a drought started and sometimes when it ends too. Its effects often build up slowly over a long period of time and may last from months to years after rain resumes.\nMany people die every year in famines due to drought in subsistence farming areas.

There are different types of formats of a movie theatre.\nThe first movie theatre was opened to the public on April 23, 1896, in Koster and Bial's Music Hall on 34th Street in New York City. The oldest movie theatre in the world, which is still in action today is the \"Kino Pionier\" (opened 1907) in Szczecin, Poland. Movie theatres make money from not only movie tickets but from concessions which sell food and drinks (popcorn, candy, soft drinks, etc.). In recent years with the increase of movie rental costs, theatres have become more and more creative about how they make money. New theatres being built include restaurants, party rooms, conference rooms, arcades and more."}

Because they were born in the United States, they can speak English perfectly. They are the only child of the 1970s Enka singer Keiko Fuji. Their first Japanese album, \"First Love\", was very popular. It sold more copies than any other Japanese singer ever. They are also known in the west for singing the theme songs for \"Kingdom Hearts\" and \"Kingdom Hearts II\": \"Simple and Clean\" and \"Sanctuary\".\nEarly Life.\nWhen Hikaru was little, they did not want to become a singer. They saw how busy their parents' lives were, and did not want that for themselves. When they were 10 years-old, their parents asked them if they wanted to write songs. They did not want to, but tried doing it. They wrote a song called \"I'll Be Stronger\". During this time, Hikaru went to school in New York. Their classmates were not able to say their name right (Hee-ka-roo) so they shortened it to 'Hikki'. 'Hikki' became Hikaru's nickname. Their fans in Japan call them that. The name is not promoted very much in the United States because it sounds too much like 'hickey'.\nEarly career.\nIn 1996, Hikaru started to record an album, when they were only 13 years old. It was in English. The album was in the R&amp;B style. It was written all by themselves. The album was going to be released on the EMI's record company, but since the company fell apart, it was never sold in the United States. A man called Akira Miyake from Japan heard the album, and wanted to release it there. Hikaru agreed, and the album was released in Japan in 1998.\nRise to fame.\nThe album sold okay, but it was not until later when Hikaru started to sing Japanese songs that they became famous. Their music still sounded very R&amp;B, but at this point, it sounded more like pop. Their first single, \"Automatic / Time Will Tell\", reached #2 on the single charts in Japan. A while later, after another single, they released their first Japanese album, \"First Love\". This sold a very large amount (over 9 million copies) and became the most sold album by a Japanese singer.\nHikaru went on to release two more albums: \"Distance\" (2001), and \"Deep River\" (2002). In each album, their style changed slightly. Each album was less R&amp;B, and more pop. In 2004, they released an album made up of all her old single songs. They then released an album in English called \"Exodus\". \"Exodus\" was released under the record label Island Def-Jam. It was sold in Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom. They sang, wrote, and made the music for the whole album themselves (except for when they got hip-hop producer Timbaland to help them). The album sold many copies in Japan, but it did not sell that well in the United States. However, many famous people and music critics thought that the album was good (for example, Elton John thought it was interesting).\nHikaru has started to make new Japanese music again, but continued on making all the music themselves. Usually, a singer/songwriter will only write the music and the lyrics, but Hikaru decided they wanted to arrange their songs all by themselves as well. They released their new album, \"Ultra Blue\", in mid-2006. Soon after, they went on a tour all across Japan. This is the second time they have ever done this (despite having sung for eight years)."}

Many European countries started colonies in Africa during this time. This is an example of New Imperialism. Liberia, Ethiopia and Darwiish State were not conquered at this time.\nThe last half of the 19th century saw a change in the way countries controlled their colonies. They changed from economic control through mass settlement, to political and military control of the colony's resources, especially in the 1870s. This was seen in the fight for the areas that were controlled by European nations.\nSome famous people who helped European countries find more land in Africa included the explorers David Livingston, Henry Morton Stanley, and Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, and the French politician Jules Ferry.\nThe Berlin Conference (1884 - 1885) tried to end disputes between the United Kingdom, France's Third Republic, the German Empire, and other European countries. They agreed that \"effective occupation\" would be the rule for colonial claims. Laws were made for using direct rule on a colony, backed up by military power."}

Red algae, Green algae and Brown algae are commonly considered to be seaweed. Seaweed gets its energy from photosynthesis just as plants do.\nEcology.\nTwo specific environmental requirements are important in seaweed ecology. These are the presence of seawater (or at least brackish water) and the presence of enough light for photosynthesis. \nAnother common requirement is a place to attach to. As a result, seaweeds are commonly found near the shore. Within that area, they are found more often on rocky shores than on sand or shingle. Seaweeds occupy a wide range of ecological niches. The highest elevation is only wetted by the tops of sea spray, the lowest is several meters deep. In some areas, seaweeds near the shore can extend several miles out to sea. The limit to how much they grow in such cases is based on how much sunlight there is. The deepest living seaweeds are the various kelps.\nA number of species such as \"Sargassum\" have adapted to a fully planktonic niche and are free-floating, depending on gas-filled sacs to stay afloat.\nOthers have adapted to live in tidal rock pools. In this niche seaweeds must withstand rapidly changing temperature and salinity (amount of salt) and even occasional drying.\nUses.\nSeaweed has different uses. Sometimes it is farmed or foraged from the wild.\nFood.\nPeople living on the coast often eat seaweed, especially those in East Asia, such as Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is also used in Belize, Peru, the Canadian Maritimes, Scandinavia, Ireland, Wales, Philippines, and Scotland.\nTiwi, Albay residents discovered a new pancit or noodles made from seaweed. These have health benefits. Seaweed is rich in calcium and magnesium and seaweed noodles can be cooked into pancit canton, pancit luglug, spaghetti or carbonara.\nIn Asia, Zicai (\u7d2b\u83dc) (in China), gim (in Korea) and nori (in Japan) are sheets of dried \"Porphyra\" used in soups or to wrap sushi. \"Chondrus crispus\" (commonly known as Irish moss or carrageenan moss) is another red alga used in producing various food additives, along with Kappaphycus and various gigartinoid seaweeds. \"Porphyra\" is a red alga used in Wales to make laver. Laverbread, made from oats and the laver, is a popular dish there. Affectionately called \"Dulce\" in northern Belize, seaweeds are mixed with milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla to make a common beverage.\nSeaweeds are also harvested or cultivated for the extraction of alginate, agar and carrageenan, gelatinous substances collectively known as hydrocolloids or phycocolloids. Hydrocolloids have attained commercial significance as food additives. The food industry exploits their gelling, water-retention, emulsifying and other physical properties. Agar is used in foods such as confectionery, meat and poultry products, desserts and beverages and moulded foods. Carrageenan is used in salad dressings and sauces, dietetic foods, and as a preservative in meat and fish products, dairy items and baked goods.\nMedicine.\nSeaweed is a source of iodine, necessary for thyroid function and to prevent goitre.\nSeaweed extract is used in some diet pills. Other seaweed pills exploit the same effect as gastric banding, expanding in the stomach to make the body feel more full.\nOther uses.\nSeaweed is currently under consideration as a potential source of bioethanol. Seaweed is an ingredient in some toothpaste, cosmetics and paints."}

{"id": "23778", "revid": "590442", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23778", "title": "Fairy tale", "text": "A fairy tale is an English language expression for a kind of short story. It has the same meaning as the French expression ' or ', the German word ', the Italian ', the Polish ', the Russian ' or the Swedish \"\". These stories are not all directly about fairies, but they are different from legends and traditions (which usually say that the stories are true) and directly moral stories. There are usually fairies, goblins, elves, trolls, giants or gnomes in fairy tales, and usually magic.\nFairy tales can also mean unusual happiness (for example, the expression \"fairy tale ending\", meaning a happy ending, even though not all fairy tales have a happy ending). Also, \"fairy tale\" can simply mean any unbelievable story.\nWhere demons and witches are seen as real, fairy tales can sometimes be similar to legends, where the story is claimed to be historically true. However, differently from legends and epics, they usually do not specifically mention religion and actual places, people, and events. They also do not say exactly when it happened. Instead, they say that the story happened \"once upon a time\".\nFairy tales are found in oral form (passed on from mouth to mouth) and in literary form (written down). Fairy tales' histories are hard to find. This is because only written fairy tales can be passed on for a long time. Still, literary works show that there have been fairy tales for thousands of years. Many fairy tales today have are based on very old stories that have appeared, though in different ways, in many different cultures around the world. Fairy tales, and works based on from fairy tales, are still written today.\nAt first, fairy tales were for both adults and children, but now children are mostly connected with fairy tales. Examples of traditional old fairy tales are \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and \"The Three Little Pigs\". There can also be new fairy tales written by an author, like \"The Little Mermaid\" or \"Pinocchio\". New fairy tales were for example written by Hans Christian Andersen, James Thurber and Oscar Wilde.\nMeaning.\nPeople do not agree what a fairy tale exactly is. Some argue that a story with fairies or other magical beings in the story would make it a fairy tale. However, others have suggested that the expression began when the French expression \"conte de f\u00e9es\" was being translated (it was first used by Madame D'Aulnoy in 1697). Vladimir Propp criticized the difference between \"fairy tales\" and \"animal tales\" in his book \"Morphology of the Folktale\". He said that many stories had both fantastic qualities and animals. He suggested that fairy tales could be recognized by their story, but this has been criticized, because the same stories can be found in stories that are not fairy tales.\nIn fact, people such as Stith Thompson point out that there are often more talking animals and magic in fairy tales than fairies. However, just because there is a talking animal in a story does not mean that the story is a fairy tale.\nSteven Swann Jones said that fairy tales were different from other sorts of folktales because of magic. Davidson and Chaudri say that \"transformation (changing)\" is the most important part of a fairy tale.\nSome like to use the German expression \"M\u00e4rchen\" or \"wonder tale\" instead of \"fairy tale\". For example, in his 1977 edition of \"The Folktale\", Thompson said that fairy tales were \"a tale of some length involving a succession of motifs or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without definite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the marvelous. In this never-never land, humble heroes kill adversaries (enemies), succeed to kingdoms and marry princesses.\" The characters and motifs of fairy tales are simple: princesses and girls taking care of geese; youngest sons and brave princes; ogres, giants, dragons, and trolls; wicked stepmothers and false heroes; fairy godmothers and other magic helpers, often talking horses, or foxes, or birds; rules, and people breaking rules. \nHistory.\nFairy tales were passed down by speaking of it from person to person before writing was developed. Stories were told or acted out dramatically. Because of this, the history of fairy tales is not very clear. The oldest written fairy tales we know are from ancient Egypt, around 1300 BC. There are sometimes fairy tales in written literature in different cultures, such as \"The Golden Ass\", which includes \"Cupid and Psyche\" (Roman, 100\u2013200 AD). They show that fairy tales were told from very long ago."}

{"id": "23805", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23805", "title": "Octopus", "text": "Octopus is a genus of cephalopod mollusc in the order Octopoda. The genus is quite typical of most octopods. They have two, large eyes and eight limbs with suckers. They have a hard beak, with the mouth at the center point of the arms.\nOctopods have no internal or external skeleton, allowing them to squeeze through tight places. Many stay in cracks between rocks or corals when they are not hunting. They are intelligent predators with a taste for crabs.\nOctopods inhabit many regions of the ocean, especially coral reefs. For defense against predators, they hide, flee quickly, expel ink, or use colour-changing camouflage. They live rather short lives.\nAn octopus trails its eight arms behind it as it swims. All octopods are venomous, but only the small blue-ringed octopus is known to be deadly to humans.\nThere are about 300 octopod species, of which more than 100 are in the genus \"Octopus\". Octopods make up over one-third of the total number of living cephalopods. The term 'octopus' may be used to refer to those in the genus \"Octopus\". The term 'octopod' is correct for members of the order Octopoda in general.\nAnatomy.\nUnlike most other cephalopods, most octopods have only soft body with no internal skeleton. They have no protective outer shell like the nautilus, which is another type of cephalopod.\nA beak, similar in shape to a parrot's beak, is their only hard part.\nBecause of this, it is very easy for an octopus to squeeze through very narrow openings between rocks, for example squeezing through a hole as big as its eye.\nEyes.\nOctopod eyes are complex. In fact, they do not have a blind spot. A \"blind spot\" is a special place in the eyes that is not able to sense light. So, when we look somewhere, part of what is there is not actually perceived (the brain 'fills in' so we do not notice). However, an octopus does not have this problem.\nThe lens in octopod are movable. It moves back and forth to focus. This is the way a camera focuses. When a camera focuses on an object to take a picture, the lens moves back and forth until the image that the camera sees is in the right focus.\nColours.\nSome octopuses can use their chromatophores for more than camouflage. If they are not blending in with their surroundings, they can signal their feelings using colour. When they are relaxed, for example, they are a dull, grayish brown or orange-tinged colour. When they become angry, they can become red. If they feel scared, they may turn white.\nBehaviour.\nIntelligence.\nOctopods are highly intelligent, probably more so than any other invertebrate. The exact extent of their intelligence and learning capability is much debated among biologists. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown that they do have both short and long-term memory. Their short lifespans limit the amount they can learn.\nSome octopods, such as the mimic octopus, can move their arms in ways which copy the movements of other sea creatures.\nIn laboratory experiments, octopuses can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They have been seen in what some have described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquaria and sometimes into others in search of food.\nThe largest of the 300+ species of octopods, the giant octopus \"Enteroctopus\", is large indeed. Mature males average about 50 pounds and females about 33 pounds. Their arm spans are about eight feet. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to get in and eat crabs.\nIn the UK, cephalopods such as octopuses are regarded as \"honorary vertebrates\" under the \"Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986\". This gives them protection not normally given to invertebrates.\nOctopods are the only invertebrate which have been definitely shown to use tools. At least four specimens of the veined octopus (\"Amphioctopus marginatus\") have been seen picking up discarded coconut shells, and then reassembling them to use as shelter.\nOctopods are active and intelligent predators, with good eyesight and brains. They eat mostly crabs and some fish.\nDefences.\nOctopods have a variety of defences. They use active camouflage and mimicry, controlled by their nervous system. Most can eject black ink clouds to help escape, and some can shed an arm in extreme danger. It wriggles, and attracts the attacker.\nReproduction and death.\nWhen octopods reproduce, males use a specialized arm to put packets of sperm into the female's mantle cavity. Males die within a few months of mating. In some species, the female octopus can keep the sperm alive inside her for weeks until her eggs are mature.\nAfter they have been fertilized, the female lays about 200,000 eggs (this figure dramatically varies between species). The female cares for the eggs, guarding them against predators, and gently blows currents of water over them so they get enough oxygen. The female does not hunt during the one-month period spent taking care of the unhatched eggs, and may ingest some of her own arms for sustenance.\nAt around the time the eggs hatch, the mother leaves the lair and is too weak to defend herself from predators like cod, often succumbing to their attacks. The young larval octopuses spend a period of time drifting in clouds of plankton, where they feed until they are ready to descend to the ocean bottom, where the cycle repeats.\nAll octopods for which we have data have a relatively short life expectancy. Some species live for as little as six months. Larger species, such as the North Pacific giant octopus, may live for up to five years under suitable circumstances.\n\"Reproduction is a cause of death\": males can only live for a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. They neglect to eat during the (roughly) one-month period spent taking care of their unhatched eggs, but apparently they do not die of starvation. A biological explanation of these short lifespans (or rapid ageing) is not agreed at present.\nDeep-sea octopod broods eggs.\nOff the coast of California, marine biologists have watched the same female octopod guarding her eggs for over four years. Their development took a long time because the water 1.4 kilometres down was very cold. They knew it was the same octopod because it had a characteristic scar. The research was done using a remote diving vehicle with cameras, lights and robotic arms."}

Unlike the Western Roman Empire, the most important language was Greek, not Latin, and Greek culture and identity dominated.\nName.\nThe Byzantine Empire was known to its inhabitants as:\nStart of the Empire 330\u2013476 AD.\nIn 324, the Roman Emperor Constantine I moved the capital of the Roman Empire to the city of \"Byzantium\", and he renamed the city Constantinople. 150 years later, after the city of Rome was slowly taken over by Germanic people during the Migration period, Constantinople was the only remaining capital of the Empire. This Eastern empire had a smaller territory than the original Roman Empire.\nProblems in The Empire 476\u2013717 AD.\nWars in the West.\nThe Byzantine Empire tried to take back Rome and Italy from the Germans. Between 530\u2013555 AD, the Byzantines won many battles and took back Rome.\nThese gains did not last however. More Germans came and eventually Italy and Rome was lost again. Worse was to come when Avar and Slavic peoples came to take modern Bulgaria and Greece from the Byzantines. Gradually, after the 560s the invaders won much of the Balkans. These invaders were later followed by the Bulgarians. The Avars and Bulgarians were both Turkic peoples at first. They ruled over Slavic people called \"Sklavinai\" and slowly absorbed Slavic language and customs.\nWars in the East.\nAfter western Rome was captured by Germanic people, the Empire continued to control modern Egypt, Greece, Palestine, Syria and Turkey. However, another Empire, known as the Persian or Sassanid Empire, tried to take these lands for itself. Between 224\u2013628 AD, the Romans and the Persians fought many battles, with many men killed in the fighting. Eventually, the Persians were defeated in modern-day Iraq, near the ancient city of Nineveh in 627 AD, allowing the Byzantines to keep their lands.\nAfter this, another enemy appeared: the Arabs. The Byzantines were economically damaged by the battles with the Persians. They could not withstand the Arabs. Palestine, Syria and Egypt were lost between 635 and 645. However, the Byzantines defended Asia Minor (modern Turkey) and the Arab advance stopped.\nRecovery of the Empire: 717\u20131025 AD.\nIn 718 AD, the Arabs were defeated outside Constantinople, ending the Arab threat in the east, but leaving the Byzantine Empire severely weakened. In the west, the Byzantines launched a number of attacks against the Bulgarians. Some of these were successful, others were not and led to the deaths of many emperors. Over time, the Byzantine Empire would became weaker as it loss land to outside invaders.\nRecovery in the west.\nBetween 1007\u20131014, the ambitious Byzantine Emperor Basil II attacked Bulgaria many times and eventually won a great victory. Later, he fully recaptured Greece, adding it back to the Byzantine Empire. He then went on to conquer Bulgaria, which was completed in 1018.\nRecovery in the east.\nIn the east, the Arabs once again became a threat to the Empire. However, Basil II's attacks won many more victories. Much of Syria was restored to the Empire and Turkey and Armenia were secured. After 1025, the Arabs were no longer a threat to the Byzantine Empire.\nDecline of the Empire 1025\u20131453.\nStart of Decline (1025\u20131071).\nAfter the Byzantine Emperor Basil II died, many unskilled Emperors came to the throne. They wasted the money of the Empire and reduced its army. This meant that it could not defend itself well against enemies if they would attack. Later, the Byzantines relied on mercenaries, soldiers who fought for money and not for their country, so they were less loyal and reliable and more expensive. Because they had mercenaries, military generals were able to rise to power and grab it from the elaborate bureaucracy, a system of administration where tasks are divided by departments.\nRise of the Turks (1071\u20131091).\nA large number of people known as the Turks rode on horseback from central Asia and attacked the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Empire took all of Turkey from the Byzantines by 1091. However, the Byzantines received help from people in Europe. This help is known as the First Crusade. Many knights and soldiers left to help the Byzantines but also to secure Jerusalem for Christians, which at the time was in Muslim hands.\nThe Byzantines survive (1091\u20131185).\nThe Byzantine Empire survived and with the help of the Europeans took back half of Turkey from the Turks, with the other half remaining under the Turks. The Byzantines survived because three good Emperors ruled one after the other, allowing the Byzantines to grow strong again.\nThe Byzantines become weak again (1185-1261).\nAfter the three good Emperors, the remaining Emperors ruled badly and again wasted a lot of money and soldiers.\nIn the west, the Europeans betrayed the Byzantines and attacked their capital, Constantinople. The Byzantines lost their capital in 1204 and they did not take it back until 1261. The Byzantines were then divided into many smaller Greek states that were fighting with each other for the throne of the Empire.\nThe Turks take the Byzantines (1261\u20131453).\nAfter the Byzantines took back Constantinople, they were too busy fighting the Europeans who had betrayed them and could not find enough soldiers or money to fight the new Ottoman Empire of the Turks. All of Anatolia was lost by 1331. In 1369, the Turks crossed over from Turkey and into Greece, taking over much of Greece between 1354\u20131450. \nThe Byzantines lost so much land, money and soldiers that they became very weak and begged for help from the Europeans. Some soldiers and ships came from Italy and the Pope to assist the Byzantines when the Turks attacked Constantinople in April 1453. They were very outnumbered though, and the walls of Constantinople were badly damaged by cannons used by the Turks. At the end of May 1453, the Turks captured Constantinople by entering through one of the gates along the walls and the Empire came to an end. The city was plundered for three days. At the end, the population which had not been able to escape, was deported to Edirne, Bursa and other Ottoman cities, leaving the city deserted except for the Jews of Balat and the Genoese of Pera. After that, Constantinople became Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, which it would be until the 1900s, when the capital was moved to Ankara, a city in the Asian part of Turkey.\nLegacy.\nThe Byzantine Empire had many achievements:"}

{"id": "23826", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23826", "title": "Guqin", "text": "The (; ; Wade\u2013Giles: ku-ch'in; literally \"ancient stringed-instrument\") is the modern name for a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family. It has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favored by educated people as an instrument of great beauty and refinement. It is uncommonly spelt as Gu Qin (and sometimes GuQin or Gu-qin) in English.\nTraditionally the instrument was called simply qin \u300c\u7434\u300d, but by the 20th century the term had come to be used on many other musical instruments as well (for example, the \"yangqin\" \u300c\u63da\u7434\u300d hammered dulcimer, the \"huqin\" \u300c\u80e1\u7434\u300d family of bowed string instruments, and the Western piano (; literally \"steel stringed-instrument\")), so the prefix \"gu-\" \u300c\u53e4\u300d (meaning \"ancient\") was added for clarification. It can also be called qixianqin \u300c\u4e03\u7d43\u7434\u300d (\"seven-stringed instrument\"). The guqin is not to be confused with the \"guzheng\", another Chinese long zither also without frets, but with moveable bridges under each string. Because Robert Hans van Gulik's famous book about the qin is called \"The Lore of the Chinese Lute\", the qin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute. Other incorrect classifications (mainly from music CDs) include \"harp\" or \"table-harp\". Other Western nicknames for the guqin include \"Chinese guitar\" and \"Chinaman's harp\".\nThe qin is a very quiet instrument, with a range of about four octaves, and its open strings are tuned in the bass register (its lowest pitch is about two octaves below middle C, or the lowest note on the cello). Sounds are produced by plucking open strings, stopped strings, and harmonics. Stopped sounds are special for the variety of slides and ornaments used, and the use of glissando (sliding tones) gives it a sound similar to a pizzicato cello or fretless bass guitar. Extended sections in music scores consisting entirely of harmonics are common, this made possible because the 91 indicated harmonic positions allow great flexibility; early tablature shows that even more harmonic positions were used in the past. By tradition the qin originally had five strings, but ancient qin-like instruments with 10 or more strings have been found. The modern form has been standardized from about two thousand years.\nHistory.\nLegend has it that the qin, has a history of about 5,000 years; that the legendary people of China's pre-history; Fuxi, Shennong and Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor), was involved in its creation. It is mentioned in Chinese writings dating back nearly 3,000 years, and related instruments have been found in tombs from about 2,500 years ago. Chinese tradition says the qin originally had five strings, but then two were added about 1,000 BCE, making seven.\nBased on the detailed description in the poetic essay \"Qin Fu\" \u3010\u7434\u8ce6\u3011 by Xi Kang / Ji Kang (223\u2013262), the form of the qin that is recognizable today was most likely set around the late Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD). The earliest surviving qin in this modern form, preserved in both Japan and China, have been dated to the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Many are still playable, the most famous perhaps being the one named \"Jiuxiao Huanpei\" \u300a\u4e5d\u9704\u74b0\u4f69\u300b, said to have been made by the famous late Tang dynasty qin maker Lei Wei (\u96f7\u5a01). It is kept in the Forbidden City Museum in Beijing.\nAccording to Robert Temple, the qin played an important part in the gaining the first understanding of music timbre for the Chinese. He said that \"the Chinese understanding of the nature of sound as vibration was much increased by studying the production of timbre on the strings of the \"ch'in\".\" This understanding of timbre, overtones and higher harmonics eventually led the Chinese to discover equal temperament in music.\nIn 1977, a recording of \"Liu Shui\" (Flowing Water, as performed by Guan Pinghu, one of the best qin players of the 20th century) was chosen to be included in the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated LP recording containing music from around the world, which was sent into outer space by NASA on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecrafts. It is the longest music track included on the disc. In 2003, guqin music was proclaimed one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\nSchools, societies and players.\nHistorical schools and societies.\nBecause of the difference in geography in China, many qin schools known as \"qin pai\" (\u7434\u6d3e) developed over the centuries. Such schools generally formed around areas where qin activity was greatest.\nThe main schools are: \nMost qin schools and groups are based in China. During the 20th century some societies began in other countries. Qin study was initially confined to China in ancient times. Today countries like Japan also have their own qin small traditions. The Tokyo Qin Society was recently founded. Japan has published a \"qinpu\" (qin tablature collection) in the past, known as \"Toukou Kinpu\" or \"Donggao Qinpu\" \u3010\u6771\u81ef\u7434\u8b5c\u3011.\nPlayers.\nThere have been many players throughout the ages. The instrument was a favourite of the scholars, so many artists played it. Some famous players are also associated with some melodies, like Confucius and Qu Yuan.\nHistorical:\nClassical books such as \"Qin Shi\", \"Qinshi Bu\" and \"Qinshi Xu\" have biographies of hundreds of more players.\nPlaying technique.\nThe beauty of qin melodies comes not only from the melodies themselves, but from the variation a player can apply to the individual tones and their combinations. The rich tones of the qin can be categorised as three distinctively different \"sounds.\" The first is \"san yin\" \u3014\u6563\u97f3\u3015, which means \"scattered sounds.\" This meant simply pluck the required string to sound an open note. The second is \"fan yin\" \u3014\u6cdb\u97f3\u3015, or \"floating sounds.\" These are harmonics, and the player simply lightly touches the string with one or more fingers of the left hand at a position indicated by the white \"hui\" dots, pluck and then lift, creating a crisp and clear sound ringing sound. The third is \"an yin\" \u3014\u6309\u97f3 / \u6848\u97f3 / \u5be6\u97f3 / \u8d70\u97f3\u3015, or \"stopped sounds.\" This forms the majority of most qin pieces and requires the player to press on a string with a finger or thumb of the left hand until it touches with the surface board, then pluck. Afterwards, the hand can slide up and down, thereby changing the pitch.\nWhen plucking the strings, it is not required to attach fake-nails on one's fingers. One will often leave their fingernails long, and cut them into an rounded shape. The length is subjective and will depend on the player's preference, but it is usually around 3-4mm from the finger tip. If it is too short, then the finger tip will deaden the sound as it touches the string after the nail has plucked it. If it is too long then the fingers can make playing difficult. Generally, the nails of the right hand are kept long, whilst the nails of the left are cut short, so as to be able to press on the strings without difficulty.\nThere are eight basic right hand finger techniques: \"pi\" \u3008\u5288\u3009 (thumb pluck outwards), \"tuo\" \u3008\u6258\u3009 (thumb pluck inwards), \"mo\" \u3008\u62b9\u3009 (index in), \"tiao\" \u3008\u6311\u3009 (index out), \"gou\" \u3008\u52fe\u3009 (middle in), \"ti\" \u3008\u5254\u3009 (middle out), \"da\" \u3008\u6253\u3009 (ring in), and \"zhai\" \u3008\u6458\u3009 (ring out); the little finger is not used. Out of these basic eight, their combinations create many more. \"Cuo\" \u3008\u64ae\u3009 is to pluck two strings at the same time, \"lun\" \u3008\u8f2a\u3009 is to pluck a string with the ring, middle and index finger out in quick succession, the \"suo\" \u3008\u9396\u3009 technique involves plucking a string several times in a fixed rhythm, \"bo\" \u3008\u64a5\u3009 cups the fingers and strums two strings at the same time, and \"gun fu\" \u3008\u6efe\u62c2\u3009 is to create a sequence of sounds by running up and down the strings continuously with the index and middle fingers. These are just a few.\nLeft hand techniques start from the simple pressing down on the string (mostly with the thumb between the flesh and nail, and the ring finger), sliding up or down to the next note (\"shang\" \u3008\u4e0a\u3009 and \"xia\" \u3008\u4e0b\u3009), to vibrati by swaying the hand (\"yin\" \u3008\u541f\u3009 and \"nao\" \u3008\u7331\u3009, there are as many as 15 plus different forms of vibrato), plucking the string with the thumb whilst the ring finger stops the string at the lower position (\"qiaqi\" \u3008\u6390\u8d77 / \u642f\u8d77\u3009), hammering on a string using the thumb (\"yan\" \u3008\u63a9 / \u7f68\u3009), to more difficult techniques such as pressing on several strings at the same time.\nTechniques executed by both hands together are more difficult to achieve, for example, \"qia cuo san sheng\" \u3008\u6390\u64ae\u4e09\u8072\u3009 (a combination of hammering on and off then plucking two strings, then repeating), to more exciting forms, like pressing of all seven strings with the left, then strumming all the strings with the right, then the left hand quickly moves up the qin, creating a rolling sound like a bucket of water being thrown in a deep pool of water (this technique is used in the Shu style of \"Liu Shui\" to copy the sound of water).\nIn order to master the qin, there are in excess of 50 different techniques that must be mastered. Even the most commonly used (such as \"tiao\") are difficult to get right without proper instruction from a teacher.\nTablature and notation.\nWritten qin music did not directly tell what notes were played like many outer musical instruments; instead, it was written in a tablature detailing tuning, finger positions, and plucking technique, thus made up of a step by step method and description of how to play a piece. Some tablatures do indicate notes using the \"gongche\" notation system, or indicate rhythm using dots.\nThe earliest example of the modern shorthand tablature survives from around the 12th century CE. An earlier form of music notation from the Tang era survives in just one manuscript, dated to the 7th century CE, called \"Jieshi Diao: You Lan\" \u300a\u78a3\u77f3\u8abf\u5e7d\u862d\u300b (Solitary Orchid, in Stone Tablet Mode). It is written in a longhand form called \"wenzi pu\" \u3014\u6587\u5b57\u8b5c\u3015 (literally \"written notation\"), which gives all the details using ordinary written Chinese characters. Later in the Tang dynasty, Cao Rou (\u66f9\u67d4) and others simplified the notation, using only the important elements of the characters (like string number, plucking technique, \"hui\" number and which finger to stop the string) and combined them into one character notation. This meant that instead of having two lines of written text to describe a few notes, a single character could represent one note, or sometimes as many as nine. This notation form was called \"jianzi pu\" \u3014\u6e1b\u5b57\u8b5c\u3015 (literally \"reduced notation\") and it was a great step forward for recording qin scores. It was so successful that from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) onwards, a lot of qinpu \u3014\u7434\u8b5c\u3015 (qin tablature collections) appeared, the most famous and useful being \"Shenqi Mipu\" (The Mysterious and Marvellous Tablature) compiled by Zhu Quan (\u6731\u52f8), the 17th son of the founder of the Ming dynasty. In the 1960s, Zha Fuxi discovered more than 130 qinpu that contain well over 3360 pieces of written music. Many qinpu compiled before the Ming dynasty are now lost, and many pieces have remained unplayed for hundreds of years.\nExisting qinpu generally come from private collections or in public libraries throughout China, etc. Those that are available for public purchase are photographic copies printed and bound in the traditional Chinese bookbinding process. More modern qinpu tend to be bound in the normal Western way on modern paper. The format uses qin notation with staff notation and/or \"jianpu\" notation.\nRepertoire.\nQin pieces are usually around three to eight minutes in length, with the longest being \"Guangling San\" \u300a\u5ee3\u9675\u6563\u300b, which is 22 minutes long. Other famous pieces include \"Liu Shui\" \u300a\u6d41\u6c34\u300b (Flowing Water), \"Yangguan San Die\" \u300a\u967d\u95dc\u4e09\u758a\u300b (Three Refrains on the Yang Pass Theme), \"Meihua San Nong\" \u300a\u6885\u82b1\u4e09\u5f04\u300b (Three Variations on the Plum Blossom Theme), \"Xiao Xiang Shui Yun\" \u300a\u701f\u6e58\u6c34\u96f2\u300b (Mist and Clouds over the Xiao and Xiang Rivers), and \"Pingsha Luo Yan\" \u300a\u5e73\u6c99\u843d\u96c1\u300b (Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank). The average player can generally play around ten pieces from memory which they will aim to play very well, learning new pieces as and when they feel like it. Players mainly learn popular well studied versions, often using a recording as a reference. In addition to learning to play established or ancient pieces very well, highly skilled qin players may also compose or improvise, although the player must be very good and extremely familiar with the instrument to be successful at it.\nDapu \u3014\u6253\u8b5c\u3015 is the conversion of old tablature into a playable form. This can be used to create new music as well as to reconstruct the ancient melodies. Since qin tablature does not indicate note value, tempo or rhythm, the player must work it out for him/herself. Normally, qin players will learn the rhythm of a piece through a teacher. They sit facing one another, with the student copying the master. The tablature will only be looked at if the teacher is not sure of how to play a certain part. Because of this, traditional qinpu do not indicate them. If one did not have a teacher, then one had to work out the rhythm by themselves. But it would be a mistake to say that qin music has no rhythm or melody. By the 20th century, there had been attempts to try to replace the shorthand notation, but so far, it has been unsuccessful; since the 20th century, qin music is generally printed with staff notation above the qin tablature. Because qin tablature is so useful, logical, easy, and the fastest way (once the performer knows how to read the notation) of learning a piece, it is invaluable to the qin player and cannot totally be replaced. There are two views of how to best use dapu: one is to use it to create new music, and the other is to use it to reconstruct the way the original music was played.\nConstruction.\nAccording to tradition, the qin originally had five strings, representing the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth. Later, in the Zhou dynasty, Zhou Wen Wang \u5468\u6587\u738b added a sixth string to mourn his son, Bo Yihou \u4f2f\u9091\u8003. His successor, Zhou Wu Wang \u5468\u6b66\u738b, added a seventh string to motivate his troops into battle with the Shang. The thirteen \"hui\" \u300e\u5fbd\u300f on the surface represent the 13 months of the year (the extra 13th is the 'leap month' in the lunar calendar). The surface board is round to represent Heaven and the bottom board flat to represent earth. The entire length of the qin (in Chinese measurements) is 3 feet, 6.5\u00a0inches, representing the 365 days of the year (though this is just a standard since qins can be shorter or longer depending on the period's measurement standard or the maker's preference). Each part of the qin has meaning, some more obvious, like \"dragon pool\" \u300e\u9f8d\u6c60\u300f and \"phoenix pond\" \u300e\u9cf3\u6cbc\u300f.\nThe sound chamber of the qin is constructed with two boards of wood, typically of differing wood types. The slightly rounded top board (soundboard) is usually made of \"tong\" wood \u300e\u6850\u300f, the Chinese parasol tree, or Chinese paulownia. The bottom board is made of \"zi mu\" \u300e\u6893\u6728\u300f catalpa (\"Catalpa ovata\") or, more recently, \"nan mu\" \u300e\u6960\u6728\u300f camphor wood (\"Machilus nanmu\"). The wood must be well aged, that is, the sap and moisture must be removed (of the top board wood). If sap remains then the sound will not be clear and, as the moisture evaporates, the wood will warp and crack. Some makers use old or ancient wood to construct qins because most of the sap and moisture has been removed naturally by time (old \"shan mu\" \u300e\u6749\u6728\u300f, Chinese Cunninghamia or Japanese Cryptomeria, is often used for creating modern qins). Some go to lengths to obtain extremely ancient wood, such as that from Han dynasty tomb structures or coffins. Although such wood is very dry, it is not necessarily the best since it may be infected with wood worm or be of a bad quality or type. Many modern qins made out of new \"tong\" wood (such as those made by Zeng Chengwei) can be better than the quality of antique qins.\nThere are two sound holes in the bottom board, as the playing techniques of the qin employ the entire surface of the top board which is curved / humped. The inside of the top board is hollowed out to a degree. Inside the qin, there are 'nayin' \u300e\u7d0d\u97f3\u300f sound absorbers, and a 'tian chu' \u300e\u5929\u67f1\u300f and 'di chu' \u300e\u5730\u67f1\u300f soundposts that connect the bottom board to the top. The boards are joined using bamboo nails. Lacquer \u300e\u6f06\u300f from the Chinese lacquer tree (\"Rhus vernicifera\") is then applied to the surfaces of the qin, mixed with various types of powder, the most common being \"lujiao shuang\" \u300e\u9e7f\u89d2\u971c\u300f, the remains of deer antler after the glue has been eremoved. Often, ceramic powder is used instead of deer antler powder, but the quality is not as good. After the lacquer has dried (a qin will need several layers), the surface will be polished using oil stones. At the head end of the instrument is the \"yue shan\" \u300e\u5cb3\u5c71\u300f or bridge, and at the other end is the \"long yin\" \u300e\u9f8d\u9f66\u300f (dragon's gums) or nut. There are 13 circular mother-of-pearl inlays which mark the harmonic positions, as well as a reference point to note position, called \"hui\" \u300e\u5fbd\u300f (\"insignia\").\nStrings.\nUntil the Cultural Revolution, the guqin's strings were always made of various thicknesses of twisted silk \u300e\u7d72\u300f, but since then most players use modern nylon-flatwound steel strings \u300e\u92fc\u7d72\u300f. This was partly due to the scarcity of high quality silk strings and partly due to the newer strings' greater durability and louder tone.\nSilk strings are made by gathering a prescribed number of strands of silk thread, then twisting them tightly together. The twisted cord of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid of natural glue that binds the strands together. The strings are taken out and left to dry, before being cut into the appropriate length. The top thicker strings (i.e. strings one to four) are further wrapped in a thin silk thread, coiled around the core to make it smoother.\nRecently in China, production of very good quality silk strings has resumed and more players are beginning to use them. Although most contemporary players use nylon-wrapped metal strings, some argue that nylon-wrapped metal strings cannot replace silk strings for their refinement of tone. Furthermore, it is the case that nylon-wrapped metal strings can cause damage to the wood of old qins. Many traditionalists feel that the sound of the fingers of the left hand sliding on the strings to be a distinctive feature of qin music. The modern nylon-wrapped metal strings were very smooth in the past, but are now slightly modified in order to capture these sliding sounds.\nTuning.\nTo string a qin, one traditionally had to tie a butterfly knot (\"shengtou jie\" \u300e\u8805\u982d\u7d50\u300f) at one end of the string, and slip the string through the twisted cord (\"rongkou\" \u300e\u7d68\u5245\u300f) which goes into holes at the head of the qin and then out the bottom through the tuning pegs (\"zhen\" \u300e\u8eeb\u300f). The string is dragged over the bridge (\"yueshan\" \u300e\u5cb3\u5c71\u300f), across the surface board, over the nut (\"longyin\" \u300e\u9f8d\u9f66\u300f dragon gums) to the back of the qin, where the end is wrapped around two legs (\"fengzu\" \u300e\u9cf3\u8db3\u300f \"phoenix feet\" or \"yanzu\" \u300e\u96c1\u8db3\u300f \"geese feet\"). Afterwards, the strings are fine tuned using the tuning pegs. The most common tuning, \"zheng diao\" \u3008\u6b63\u8abf\u3009, is pentatonic: 1245612 in the traditional Chinese number system or \"jianpu\" \u3014\u7c21\u8b5c\u3015. Today this is generally interpreted to mean C D F G A c d, but this should be considered do re fa so la do re, since historically the qin was not tuned to absolute pitch. In fact the same tuning can also be considered as 5612356 when the third string is played as do. Thus, except when accompanied by other instruments, only the pitch relations between the seven strings needs to be accurate. Other tunings are achieved by adjusting the tension of the strings using the tuning pegs at the head end. Thus \"manjiao diao\" \u3008\u6162\u89d2\u8abf\u3009 (slackened third string) gives 1235612 and \"ruibin diao\" \u3008\u8564\u8cd4\u8abf\u3009 (raised fifth string) gives 1245712, which is transposed to 2356123.\nPlaying context.\nThe guqin is nearly always used a solo single instrument, as its quietness of tone means that it cannot be heard over the sounds of most other instruments or an ensemble. It can, however, be played together with a \"xiao\" (end-blown bamboo flute), with other qin, or played while singing. In old times, the \"se\" (a long zither with movable bridges and 25 strings, similar to the Japanese koto) was frequently used in duets with the qin.\nIn order for an instrument to accompany the qin, its sound must be mellow and not overwhelm the qin. Thus, the \"xiao\" generally used for this purpose is one pitched in the key of F, known as \"qin xiao\", which is narrower than an ordinary \"xiao\". If one sings to qin songs (which is rare nowadays) then one should not sing in an operatic or folk style as is common in China, but rather in a very low pitched and deep way; and the range in which one should sing should not exceed one and a half octaves. The style of singing is similar to that used to recite Tang poetry. To enjoy qin songs, one must learn to become accustomed to the strange style some players may sing their songs to.\nTraditionally, the qin was played in a quiet studio or room by oneself, or with a few friends; or played outdoors in places of outstanding natural beauty. Nowadays, many qin players perform at concerts in large concert halls, almost always, out of necessity, using electronic pickups or microphones to amplify the sound. Many qin players attend yaji (\u300e\u96c5\u96c6\u300f literally \"elegant gatherings\"), at which a number of qin players, music lovers, or anyone with an interest in Chinese culture can come along to discuss and play the qin.\nReferences.\nChinese books on qin:\nEnglish books on qin:\nOther websites.\nQin society sites\nGeneral Qin sites\nOther specialist Qin sites\nSites with music samples"}

In this world, mutants can be either heroes or villains. A mutant is someone who has different DNA than its parents. These mutations often lead to superpowers. They may also cause physical changes such as wings, blue skin, or a tail.\nMutants were created in the Marvel Universe in the 1960s with the comic book \"The X-Men\". It was a way for them to tell stories that dealt with racism. Racism, hatred and fear of mutants are an important part of their history . Two main teams of mutants have been around since the 1960s: The X-Men (heroes) and the Brotherhood of Mutants (villains).\nOverview.\nSometimes a human is born with a certain kind of DNA change. This \"X-GENE\" is passed to their children. This genetic change may not create any noticeable difference. It could pass for generations without anyone knowing about it.\nMutants may be born to human or mutant parents, though the odds of a mutant birth are much better for the latter. Likewise, it is rare but possible for mutant parents to have human children, termed \"baseline\" by characters within the Marvel Universe. Some baseline humans are genetically predisposed towards having mutant descendants such as the Guthrie family (see Cannonball, Husk, and Icarus). Mutant children born to mutant parent(s) will not necessarily have the same power(s) as their parent(s), nor will they necessarily have the same power(s) as any mutant siblings they may have; however, examples of children with the same power(s) as their parents and/or siblings are not uncommon.\nThere is, however, a chance that mutants may not even be able to reproduce a child at all. The Hayes (Runaways), telepathic mutant doctors, were unsure their mutant heritage could even produce a child; it did, however, take them several years to finally have a child: Molly Hayes.\nClassification.\nMarvel's mutants are classified by their level of power.\nNote: Only Alpha and Omega have actually been used as classification within comics. The other ranks were created by fans. \nMutants as a metaphor for racism.\nThe X-Men were created in the 1960s during a time of civil unrest in the United States. The characters allowed the writer to write stories that showed racism and bigotry without singling out a specific minority.\nBy classifying Mutants as they did, they also created different aspects of racism. Some mutants are easily recognized by how they look (similar to African-Americans). Some have a few physical characteristics that can make them get noticed (Similar to Jews). Other mutants blend in so well that it nearly impossible to tell they are a mutant unless they use their powers (similar to how people in the LGBT community were thought of in society).\nIn the Marvel universe normal people often hate and fear mutants. This is because they think mutants may make normal humans extinct. They fear what they do not understand. They are jealous of them having superpowers. Bigotry and xenophobia are also reasons for hatred of mutants. In the Marvel universe, anti-mutant feeling has led to the separation of mutants from society. It has led to mob violence and government sponsored attempts to fight mutants.\nThe X-Men books have been written as typical superhero comic books. They have epic adventures and battles with super villains. Yet, the idea of mutants as a metaphor for real world minorities who face oppression is shown throughout the series. Some examples:"}

It allows people and animals to remove urine from the body. People and animals control urination using the urethral sphincter.\nThe urethra is part of the urinary system in mammals. Because humans are mammals, they have urethras. In male mammals, the urethra is also a part of the reproductive system, because males use it as a tube for sperm during sex.\nHuman anatomy.\nIn human anatomy, men have longer urethras than women. This means that women have bladder infections more often, because their bladders are closer to the outside. Because the male urethra is longer and is not straight, inserting a catheter (tube to help urination) is more difficult in men.\nIn women, the urethra is 3-4 cm (1.5 in) long. Its opening to the outside of the body is part of the vulva (the area between a woman's legs). The female urethra is between the clitoris and the opening to the vagina. Men's urethra goes through their penis, but in women it is not in the clitoris.\nIn men, the urethra is about 20 cm (8 in) long and its opening to the outside of the body is at the end of the penis.\nThe male urethra has three sections:"}

He left the band and the drummer from the band, \"Friik\", John Dolmayan, joined the band.\nEarly days.\nSerj, Daron, and Shavo, went to the same school, Alex Pilibos School for Armenian Americans in Los Angeles, when they were young. \nIn 1995, they made their first demo tape, and had the songs: \"Suite-Pee\", \"Sugar\", \"Dam\", and \"P.L.U.C.K.(Politically Lying Unholy Cowardly Killers)\". In 1996, another demo tape was released with the songs: Soil, and two songs that were not on the first album, \"Honey\" and \"Temper\".

Germany, Austria and Hungary did not participate in writing the treaty. Germany had the choice of signing it or facing its occupation by Allied troops. \nGermany had to reduce its armed forces from 6 million to 100,000 men and to get rid of its submarines and military aircraft and most of its artillery. It was allowed to keep only navy battleships. \nGermany also had to give back the French territories that it had occupied. It also had to give up large territories to Poland and other neighbours and all of its colonies. It also had to pay huge reparations for the damage that had been done to Allied countries, especially France, during the war by German troops. The sum would be very large but was not yet fixed. Many gold marks had to be paid only as the first part of the German debt. \nThe treaty set up the League of Nations, which was intended to make decisions and to keep the peace after the treaty had been signed. The League solved some international disputes without war but could not stop World War II.\nThe treaty can be seen as a one-sided peace, which was dictated to Germany. The British economist John Maynard Keynes thought that it was a great mistake to force such harsh measures on the German people, but his advice was ignored.\nGermany set up the democratic Weimar Republic, but it suffered an economic collapse that went with huge inflation of its currency, the Reichsmark.\nAdolf Hitler became the German chancellor and got rid of the treaty. His actions would eventually lead to World War II.\nTerms.\nGermany had to give back Alsace-Lorraine. France was still embarrassed that Germany had been taken during the Franco-Prussian War. The French also made Germany take its troops out of the Rhineland, the long stretch of land on Germany's border with France with the Rhine River, which was important since Germany had many factories and businesses there. If German troops returned the Rhineland, the treaty allowed the French were to invade Germany.\nGermany also had to give parts to Poland, a country made out of Russian and Austrian parts and the Polish and Lithuanian people who lived in them. Poland had been a big kingdom a few hundred years earlier, but Austria, Prussia and Russia, during the Partitions of Poland, taken parts of the kingdom and ended its existence.\nBelgium was allowed to have Moresnet and Eupen and Malmedy. That is the main reason that Belgium has a German-speaking community.\nThe treaty also split up many large empires on the losing side. US President Woodrow Wilson thought that was a very good idea because many people in Europe wanted to be free from the big empires. but that also created problems such as having many little countries next to a much bigger Germany.\nIn the separate Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye the same year, Austria-Hungary was split into many countries. One was Austria, which was meant to be the homeland of the Austrians, who spoke German and had ruled Austria-Hungary. Its capital was Vienna. One of the problems of the Treaty of Versailles was that most Austrians like Adolf Hitler thought that Austria should become part of Germany. That later led to the German invasion of Austria.\nHungary was also created. Like Poland, it was a country that had been strong centuries earlier. Another new country, Czechoslovakia, was created to be the homeland of the Czechs and Slovaks. The Czech part had been called Bohemia and Moravia before the war. Many Germans lived near its borders in the Sudetenland and insisted for it to be part of Germany, which Hitler later got.\nBosnia, Slovenia, Croatia (parts of Austria-Hungary), northern Macedonia (part of Bulgaria), Serbia, and Montenegro were made into one country, called Yugoslavia, meaning \"Southern Slavic\". The new country was made to be a Southern Slavic homeland but had many religious, linguistic and national differences.\nNew countries by the Baltic Sea (Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania) were also created in other treaties after World War I. The Russian Revolution had started during the war, and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was killed and a communist state formed. A civil war raged in Russia between the anticommunist Whites and the communist Reds. Russia had lost control of its western territory (Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Poland). Later, during World War II, the Soviet Union took over Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and half of Poland.\nAnother treaty, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, gave parts the defeated Ottoman Empire to the various winners. However, the Greek and Turkish Armies soon started another war.\nLong-term problems.\nThe German Empire became the Weimar Republic. A big problem for Germany was to pay back a huge amount of money (\u00a36000 million) for the all of the damage done to the Allied countries, mostly France, during World War I. That made Germany one of the poorest countries in Europe for almost 20 years and caused political fighting in Germany. Two important parties, the Communist Party, which wanted a communist revolution like in Russia, and the Nazis, who thought that Germany should become the most powerful country in Europe, fought for many years.\nHowever, both parties strongly opposed the treaty as one that had been forced by the Allies and had been unfair. After all, Germans had to live in new countries even if they wanted to be part of Germany, but new countries were set up under the excuse of respecting the will the local populations. The treaty was, for that reason and many others, hated in Germany.\nAs Germany owed a huge amount of money to the Allies, it started to get loans by the Americans such as under the Dawes Plan. During the Great Depression in 1932, the United States wanted all its money back. Germany refused to pay and printed more and more money to pay its debts. That led to hyperinflation and the Reichsmark was worthless. Some Germans even wanted to fight another war to get rid of it.\nAlso, the League of Nations, which had been created by the treaty, usually had too little power to stop wars from happening. Japan took Manchuria, but the League did not stop that from happening. Italy invaded Ethiopia, the Ethiopian emperor begged the League to help him, but it did not do much. Germany, Japan and Italy left the League, became the Axis powers, invaded many peaceful countries, and caused World War II. The United States and for some time the Soviet Union did not even join the League even though US President Woodrow Wilson had pushed for his idea to go into the treaty. The League was never taken seriously although it had been created partly to check that the treaty was being followed. \nThe treaty failed to keep peace in the end and helped Nazi Germany, led by Hitler, to win the support of many Germans to get rid of the \"chains of Versailles\", which led to World War II.\nGermany and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Rapollo in 1922 in which both governments agreed to ignore previous treaties such as Versailles, co-operate \"in a spirit of mutual goodwill\" and help each other with their economic needs. \nGermany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and World War II started that day.\nReferences.\nLangley, Andrew, \"Living through World War II\", Chicago, IL: Heinemann Library, 2012."}

{"id": "23965", "revid": "103847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23965", "title": "Colonialism", "text": "Colonialism occurs when a country or a nation takes control of other lands, regions, or territories outside of its borders (boundaries of the country) by turning those other lands, regions, or territories into a colony. Usually, it is a more powerful, richer country that takes control of a smaller, less powerful region or territory. Sometimes the words \"colonialism\" and \"imperialism\" are used to mean the same thing. Colonialism is one of the main results of imperialism.\nIn the 1700s and 1800s, many of the richer, more powerful European countries (such as Britain, France, Spain, and the Netherlands) established colonies in the continents of Africa, South America, Asia, and the Caribbean.\nSome countries use colonialism to get more land for their people to live in. They helped settlers move to the new area. The local people living in the land or territories were usually moved away by using force and violence from armies. To protect these settlers from the local residents who were pushed aside, colonial nations often set up a military fort or colonial police system. \nOther countries use colonialism to get more land so that they can use the land for farming or to extract (take out) resources such as trees (wood), coal, or metals, or to create a local government or military fort.\nOther countries use colonialism so that they can get workers from the poorer country to work in factories or farms (either in the richer country, or in the poorer country). In the past, powerful countries that were colonizing poorer countries or regions often forced the people from the poorer countries to work as slaves.\nHistory.\nThe Phoenicians started many trade colonies around the Mediterranean. Carthage was the largest and most famous colony, and also made other colonies including Cartagena in Spain. \nLater, the Ancient Greeks expanded their territories with colonies. Ancient Greece was many city-states. Each city was independent with a government in place. Those cities also fought wars against each other and traded goods. To get more influence, or to secure a trade route, the city would send settlers to a new place. These people would then make a new city called a colony. Sometimes a new city had to pay some form of taxes to the mother city in exchange for protection, for example. The colonies, however, ruled themselves. The mother city did not send them a governor. Syracuse is the most famous of these Greek colonies. \nIf the Greek settlers found a local tribe living in the new territory, they would fight to force them to leave. The local tribe was usually made into slaves. The new colony would exploit the land it found, by growing crops or by raising cattle.\nAncient Rome invented the word \"colonia\" from the word \"colonus\" meaning \"farmer\". \"Colonia\" at that time meant a new town to which some Romans moved, including farmers. Many of the settlers were veterans. In later centuries the word \"colony\" less often meant settlers, and more often meant rule by foreigners.\nTypes of colonialism.\nThere are several different types of colonialism. Some countries that expanded their territory made settler colonies. Some countries that started out as settler colonies include the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Latin America. In all of these countries, people from European countries moved to the best parts of the new place, and forced the indigenous peoples (such as Indians, Maori, etc.) to move. When the local people or tribes had to move, it caused a lot of problems. Many of these indigenous peoples were also enslaved, killed through genocide or died in pandemics because they had no immunity against infectious diseases brought by the settlers.\nWith the plantation colony, the powerful, rich country use the poorer country's land to grow crops. Typically, slaves work on the farms. Examples of plantation colonies include Barbados, Saint-Domingue and Jamaica. \nIn some regions which were colonized, the settlers married the local people and had children with them. An example is Mexico, where a new people called the mestizos came from the marriages of the settlers and the local tribes. In other regions which were colonized, the settlers and the local people lived in separate areas, without living together or marrying. An example of this situation is French Algeria (when France colonized the African country of Algeria) or Southern Rhodesia. \nAnother type of colonialism is when a powerful country sets up (establishes) dependencies. With a dependency, the colonizing country does not send over thousands of settlers to the new territory. Instead, the colonizing country sets up administrators (a governing organization) that controls the existing local (native) populations or tribes. Examples include the British Raj, (geraldine) in which the British government controlled India; the Dutch East Indies, in which the Netherlands controlled parts of the East Indies; and the Japanese colonial empire, in which Japan controlled Asian territories.\nAnother type of colony is the trading post colony. Rich and powerful countries set up trading post colonies so that there would be a territory where trading, selling, and business could be conducted. The rich and powerful countries usually set up military forts or police forces to enforce the rules and laws of the colonizing country. Examples of trading colonies include Macau, Malacca, Deshima and Singapore.\nMassive colonization took place in Ancient India too. But the history of colonization is attributed to Greece only. In Ancient India Colonization began not with political conquest but with cultural conquest. Hinduism, and after centuries Buddhism became the main source of colonization. It was a colonization that began with cultural expansion leading to economic colonization. Indians were in the role of masters for a few centuries and in the role of slaves for centuries."}

He was nicknamed \"El Diez\", \"Pelusa\", \"El Diego\" and \"El Pibe de Oro\" (The Golden Boy). He is widely regarded as one of the best footballers ever because of his skill moves and ability to score goals, so this is why many people compare him to Brazilian legend Pel\u00e9. They were both winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th century award. \nMaradona made 91 appearances and scored 34 goals with Argentina. He played at four world cups. His greatest and most important achievement was winning the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico.\nClub Career.\nMaradona made his professional debut with Argentina on 20 October 1976 wearing the number 16 shirt, a week before his 16th birthday. He scored his first goal in November 1976 two weeks after turning 16. In 1981, he transferred to Boca Juniors, and won the league title with them that same year. His performances at the 1982 FIFA World Cup attracted the interest of FC Barcelona, and they signed him shortly after the tournament. \nIn the 1984 Copa Del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao, Maradona was involved in a fight with several other Bilbao players. During the game, Bilbao player Andoni Goikoetxea made a rough tackle on Maradona, and Bilbao fans insulted Maradona and his family. This made him very angry. Barca lost 1-0, and when he was insulted by Miguel Sola at the end of the match, Maradona lost control and became furious. He headbutted Sola, kneed Bilbao's goalie in the head, elbowed another one in the face, and kicked and punched other players as well. This ended up being his last game with the Catalan club.\nMaradona signed for Napoli in the summer of 1984 for around \u20ac8 million. At his presentation, he was greeted by 75,000 fans at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples. He led the club to its first Serie A title in 1987. That same year, he won the Coppa Italia. For the 1987-88 season, Maradona was top scorer of the league, with 15 goals. Napoli also finished second in the league to A.C. Milan. In the 1989 UEFA Cup Final against VfB Stuttgart, Maradona played an important role in Napoli's victory. He scored and assisted Careca's goal in the 2-1 victory during the first leg. In the second leg, he assisted Ciro Ferrara's goal in a 3-3 draw (5-4 on aggregate). The following year, Napoli won the Supercoppa Italiana with a 5-1 demolishing of Juventus. \nIn March 1991, Maradona failed a drug test for cocaine. He was given a 15-month ban and a fine, so he missed the rest of the 1990-91 season and the entire 1991-92 season. After being allowed to return to football in June 1992, he didn't want to return to Napoli, and he asked for a transfer. He eventually signed for Spanish club Sevilla. He stayed there for one year. He moved back to the Argentine League with Newell's Old Boys in 1993, and stayed there for one season. Maradona ended his career by making a return to Boca Juniors in 1995. He stayed there for two years until retiring on 25 October 1997. He played his last match against Boca's rival River Plate, and Boca won 2-1.\nInternational Career.\nMaradona played his first match for the Argentina national team on 27 February 1977 against Hungary, as a 16 year old. \nMaradona is most famously known for his performance against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter final, where he scored two legendary goals. The first one was controversially scored with his hand. It started with a poor clearance from an English defender that sent the ball into the penalty box. As goalkeeper Peter Shilton came off his line to challenge the ball, Maradona jumped and punched it in past Shilton, while also adding a movement as if he hit the ball with his head that fooled the referees. He later called it the \"Hand of God\", and said that he used his hand because he knew he was not going to reach the ball. The second one was voted the best goal scored in World Cup history in 2002 and many people call it the \"Goal of the Century\", where he received the ball behind the half-field line and dribbled five England players before juking out goalkeeper Shilton and passing the ball with his left foot into the open net from 6 yards out. The match ended 2-1 in favor of Argentina. \nArgentina won the World Cup after defeating West Germany in the final, and Maradona was named as the tournament's best player. The British named him \"athlete of the decade.\"\nPersonal life.\nHealth problems.\nMaradona was addicted to cocaine from the mid-1980s until 2004. During his time at Napoli, he failed a drug test in 1991 and had his conversations wiretapped by police. He was also accused of working with the Italian mafia. In 2000 he suffered a heart attack caused by cocaine overdose. In 2004, he was placed in intensive care with high blood pressure, respiratory failure, and a lung infection. \nAfter Maradona retired, he suffered from obesity. At one point, he weighed 280 lbs (130 kg). In March 2005, Maradona had a Gastric bypass surgery in Cartagena, Colombia and was placed on a liquid diet for three months to try to reduce his obesity. \nDeath.\nOn 2 November 2020, Maradona was hospitalized in La Plata because of mental health reasons. A day later, he had emergency brain surgery to treat a subdural hematoma. He was released on 12 November after successful surgery. \nOn 25 November 2020, Maradona died of a heart attack at his home in Tigre, Buenos Aires, Argentina at the age of 60.\nClub career statistics.\nNotes\nInternational career statistics.\n!Total||91||34"}

It was made in 1931 by George Beauchamp. It is a string instrument usually played with a pick and sometimes with the fingers. It uses things called \"electric pickups\" which are wire-wound magnets that change the vibration of the strings into electric current. This electric current is then sent to an amplifier (amp for short) that changes it to sound. This electric current can also be changed to produce effects. The main parts of an electric guitar are the neck, the pickups, the tuners, the bridge, the input, the body, the frets, the pick guard, the volume knobs and the tone knobs. There may also be other parts that can change other sounds. A normal electric guitar has one neck with 6 strings on it, although there are 12 string guitars and guitars with more than one neck. \nGuitars are made and sold in many parts of the world by many companies. They can be hand made or factory made. Some companies that make electric guitars are Fender, Gibson, and Ibanez. \nReading guitar tablature.\nMany guitarists today share their music through a system called tablature (commonly known as 'tab'). Tablature is a way of reading notes for a guitar. It is much simpler than musical notes, but most tabs do not support rhythm. Many tabs can be found online or in books and magazines.\nTo read guitar tab, generally there is a staff like this:\n high E ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n B ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n G ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n D ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n A ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n low E ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEach line represents a string. Tab is always read as if the player were holding the guitar on their lap, strings facing up. Each number then represents what fret the finger is placed on.\nE -----------------0------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB -----------------0------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nG --1-------------1-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nD ----2-----------2-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA ------2---------2-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nE -----------------0------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe above diagram would be to play an open E chord, picking each string individually, and then strumming the chord. If the notes are stacked directly above each other, it means to strum the chord.\nSome guitar music is written in both musical note format and tablature. The musical notes are written out, with the corresponding tablature under each line of notes."}

They speak Kurdish and the Kurdish homeland is Kurdistan, a region in the Middle East. Kurdish is an Indo-European language, and Kurds are an Indo-European people, like the peoples of western and north-western Iran. \nKurds are one of the largest and most important ethnic groups in the Middle East. There are between about 35 million and about 40 million Kurds. Most of the Kurdish population lives in Kurdistan. Kurdistan is the area where Kurds live. Today, it is a border country with lands in the east and southeast of Turkey, in the north-west of Iran, in the north of Iraq, and in the north-east of Syria. (Lands in Armenia and Azerbaijan also have small Kurdish populations.) After most of these borders came into existence after World War I, many Kurds went out of Kurdistan. They migrated to the large cities in the Middle East and to Western Europe. Since the Middle Ages, there have also been Kurdish communities in Cairo, Beirut, Damascus, and Aleppo. Since the Early Modern Period, there have also been Kurdish communities in Khorasan (north-eastern Iran and Afghanistan).\nMany Kurds speak the Kurdish language. The two largest Kurdish dialects are Kurmanji Kurdish and Sorani Kurdish. The Kurds of Turkish Kurdistan and of Syrian Kurdistan speak Kurmanji. About half of Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan speak Kurmanji, but other Kurds there speak Sorani. Some other Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan speak the Gorani Kurdish dialect, and others in Turkish Kurdistan speak Zazaki Kurdish.\nUntil the 20th century, most Kurds were nomadic people. The Kurds' economy had a close connection with pastoralism and animal husbandry. In the 21st century, nomadism is not common among Kurds. Most Kurds now live in cities. In the economy of the 21st century, farming is the most important work in Kurdistan. Industrialization means that fewer Kurds work as farmers, and this has caused urbanization of the Kurdish population. In the past, Kurds were part of the Silk Road economic system. Trade routes form connections between different countries through Kurdistan. \nThe Kurds share their lands with other ethnic groups. Some of the Kurds' neighbours are Turks, Arabs, Persians, Jews, Armenians, and Assyrians. In the past, some Arabic and Turkic people became Kurds by cultural assimilation. In the nationalist period, the governments of the states that control Kurdistan tried to assimilate the Kurds into Turkish, Iranian, and Arabic culture. These states (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria) also moved Turks, Persians, and Arabs into Kurdistan. The governments of these states have used genocide, ethnocide, linguicide, and ethnic cleansing against Kurds. The Soviet Union also forced Kurds from the Caucasus to migrate to Central Asia. When the Soviet Union ended, the First Nagorno-Karabakh War between Armenia and Azerbaijan affected most of the Kurds in the Caucasus. \nMost Kurds are Muslims. Most are part of Sunni Islam. Most Kurds are part of the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence, but some Kurds are part of the Hanafi school. Sufism is also common among Kurds. There are also Kurds who are part of Shia Islam and Kurds who are part of Alevism. There are also Kurdish Jews and Yazidis.\nName.\nThe name of the Kurds is very old. The first proof of the name is from writing in Middle Persian (Pahlavi), the language of the Sasanian Empire. The name became most common after the Muslim conquests during the 7th century CE.\nIn the Islamic world of the early Middle Ages, the word had a loose meaning. The meaning was variable, and people gave many tribes and nomadic peoples the word Kurd. Peoples living in the mountains between Anatolia and the Iranian plateau often had the name \"Kurd\". In the Persian language and the Arabic language, writers during the 10th century gave the name to different ethnic groups. Some scholars make an argument that the meaning of the name was not an ethnonym at that time, because many different groups of nomads and pastoralists had the name \"Kurds\" during the Middle Ages. However, other scholars make the argument that the name was not the name of lifestyle or economic system (like nomadism or pastoralism) but the name of a population. This population shared a common character in linguistics, shared an area to live in, and shared a mythology. Whether the people and groups who had the name \"Kurds\" thought that they were a common community before the 12th century is unknown.\nHistory.\nLate Antiquity.\nThe history of the Kurds starts with the late Sasanian Empire and the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia. Arab armies first fought against the Kurds in the late 630s. At that time, the Arabs overcame the tribes of Kurds in the mountains near Mosul. Arab armies took control of Mesopotamia in 637. Kurdish tribes helped the Sasanian armies fight against the Arabs in 639 and 644, but the Arabs had more success. Utba bin Farqad led the Arab armies that took control of the Shahrizor (a plain now in Sulaymaniyah Governorate, Iraqi Kurdistan) and the lands around Hulwan (a town now in Kermanshah Province, Iranian Kurdistan).\nThen the Kurds came under the control of the Rashidun Caliphate and converted to Islam. The Arab Muslim armies came to Kurdistan after they took control of Ctesiphon (the capital of the Sasanian Empire) in 636. This was in the time of Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. The Muslim armies attacked and overcame the cities Masibezan (near Ilam) and Hulwan (now Sarpol-e Zahab). When the armies of the Sasanian Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate met at Nahavand, they fought the Battle of Nahavand. In the battle, the Rashidun Caliphate's army overcame the army of the Sasanian Empire. The Arab armies also took control of Mosul, Shahrizor, and Urmia by force. Some places surrendered, like Mandali.\nMost Kurds converted to Islam between the 7th and 9th centuries CE. The exact process of their religious conversion is unknown, but Kurds probably wanted to free themselves from the jizya, a tax on people who were not Muslims. Most became part of Sunni Islam, and most were Shafi'ites. The Kurds fought against the government at some times, but fought with the government's army at other times. Kurdish tribes made rebellions against the Rashidun Caliphate in 645 and in 659. In 666 there were two rebellions (in Ahvaz and in Fars). During the Umayyad Caliphate, Kurds made rebellions in 685, 702, and 708. Kurdish tribes fought for Marwan II (who controlled the Umayyad Caliphate) against the rebellion in 746.\nWhen the Kurds became Muslims, they became part of the community of the Islamic world. Kurds were then able to became a part of the political and military power of the region. When the some of largest towns in the area became part of the Rashidun Caliphate (Mosul, Erbil, Shahrizor, Seymere, Borujerd, Hamadan, Dinavar, Nahavand, Siravand, and Karaj of Abu Dulaf), they became important places of education and religion during early Islam.\nMiddle Ages.\nDuring the Abbasid Caliphate, there were many rebellions by Kurds. During rebellions in 840, 846, and 866, Kurds took control of Mosul. Some Kurds were part of the Zanj Rebellion (869\u2013883) and some were part of Ya'qub ibn al-Layth as-Saffar's rebellion. The Abbasid Caliphate became weak in the 9th century, and Kurdish lords were sometimes able to take control of government in the mountains.\nThere were a number of Kurdish dynasties that controlled a number of emirates in the Kurdish region. The Shaddadids controlled lands in Armenia and Azerbaijan from 951 to 1174. The Rawwidids controlled lands in Azerbaijan between 955 and 1071. The Hasanwayhids controlled parts of western Iran between 959 and 1095. The Marwanids controlled the lands around Diyarbak\u0131r (a city now in Turkish Kurdistan) and Lake Van between 990 and 1096.\nIn the 11th century, the Seljuk dynasty and the Zengid dynasty fought wars with the Kurdish emirates. The Seljuk dynasty took control of Iran, Iraq, and Anatolia. The Zengid dynasty controlled the lands around Mosul for the Seljuks. The success of their armies ended the independence of the Kurds' emirates. When the Seljuks took control of Dvin (now in Armenia) from the Shaddadid dynasty, Shadhi ibn Marwan and his two sons Najm ad-Din Ayyub and Asad ad-Din Shirkuh worked for the Shaddadids. They went away from the city and came to Iraq. Najm ad-Din Ayyub and Asad ad-Din Shirkuh became important soldiers in the armies of Nur ad-Din Zengi, who controlled Syria and Mosul. Najm ad-Din Ayyub became governor of Baalbek and Damascus. Asad ad-Din Shirkuh became governor of Homs.\nIn 1163, Shirkuh led an invasion of the Fatimid Caliphate, which controlled Egypt. After this first attack, Shirkuh's Zengid army went out of Egypt in 1164, but they attacked again in 1167. This invasion had success, but after two years Shirkuh died. The son of Najm ad-Din Ayyub then took control of his uncle Shirkuh's army in Egypt. This son was Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (\"Saladin\"). Working for Nur ad-Din Zengi, Saladin then used the Zengid army for the destruction of the Fatimid Caliphate. Doing this, Saladin ended the control of Shia Islam in Egypt and took control of Egypt himself when Nur ad-Din died in 1174.\nSaladin's Ayyubid dynasty controlled many lands. Libya, the Hejaz, Yemen, Sudan, Egypt, and Syria were all under Saladin's control. Saladin also took control of many castles, and he took control of Jerusalem after the Battle of Hattin in 1187. (Jerusalem had been part of the Roman Catholic Kingdom of Jerusalem from the time of the First Crusade. Saladin took back Jerusalem for the Muslims.) Saladin died in 1193. The Ayyubid dynasty ended in 1250, when the Mamluks took control of Egypt and the Mongols attacked the Ayyubids in Syria. With the end of the Ayyubids' government in Egypt and Syria, Kurdish power there ended. (Some of the Ayyubid dynasty continued to control Hasankeyf into the 16th century.) Kurds continued to live in many lands that the Ayyubids had controlled. From this time, many Kurds lived in the Kurdish quarter of Damascus. (They spoke Kurdish there into the 20th century.)\nSafi ad-Din Ardabili (1252\u20131334), a Kurdish mystic, started the Safavid order. The Safavids were Sufis, and at first they were Sunni Muslims. (Safi ad-Din Ardabili was the first of the Safavid dynasty, a family that later came to be the rulers of Iran.)\nKurdish emirates and tribes continued to have military power. Both the Mongols' Ilkhanate in Iran and the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt tried to use Kurds as allies, because many Kurds lived in the mountains on the border between the Mongol Ilkhanate and the Mamluk Sultanate. The Ilkhanate government gave authority to some Kurdish rulers among the tribes. The Sultanate gave authority to an officer with the title \"Generalissimo of the Kurds\" (). Kurdistan became part of the Timurid Empire in the time of Timur, but after Timur died in 1404, the Timurid dynasty started to lose control of the country. The Qara Qoyunlu took control of the Kurdish emirates around Bitlis, Siirt, and Hasankeyf before 1450. By that time, the Kurds around Diyarbak\u0131r were controlled by the Aq Qoyunlu. In 1460 the Aq Qoyunlu attacked and took control of Siirt and Hasankeyf. Then they took control of Cizre (the emirate of Bohtan), Bitlis, and Hakkari.\nKurds were common in the hills near Gaziantep and Kilis. Near Antakya, the hills of the Jabal al-Akrad and the Kurd Dagh both had Kurdish populations. Qusayr, by the Jabal al-Akrad was the same. By the 11th century, Kurds had migrated to Jabal al-Ansariyya (\"the Alawite mountains\") and parts of Greater Lebanon (the lands of modern Lebanon). Most of these Kurds joined the Arabs in these lands and became \"Arabized\", but others became warlords in the time of the Ottoman Empire. Kurds that came from Diyarbak\u0131r in the early 16th century were the ancestors of the Druze Ma'an dynasty. They controlled Mount Lebanon in the 17th century. Some Arab families of the area have Kurdish ancestors.\nEarly Modern Period.\nAt the end of the 15th century, the Safavids overcame the Aq Qoyunlu and started the Safavid Empire. The leader of the Safavid order became shah as Shah Ismail I in 1501. He controlled the lands from Kurdistan to Afghanistan. By the 15th century, the Safavid order had become Shia Muslims, and they had military power with help from Turkmen tribes. Shah Ismail made the Twelvers' Shia Islam the state religion. Many of the Kurds, who were mostly Sunni Muslims, became enemies of the Safavid government. Although some Kurdish emirs joined the Shiites, Shah Ismail took away the authority of many Kurdish emirs. The shah gave the lands of these emirs to the Qizilbash, men who supported the shah's religious ideas.\nThe rulers of the Ottoman Empire were also Sunni Muslims, and they became the enemies of the Safavid Empire. At that time, the Ottoman Empire gave better treatment to Sunni Muslim Kurds than did the Safavid Empire. Kurdistan was part of the Safavid Empire. The Ottoman sultan, Selim I, started an invasion of Kurdistan. The armies of Sultan Selim overcame the armies of Shah Ismail at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. The Ottoman Empire took control of the western part of Kurdistan. The majority of Kurdistan became part of the Ottoman Empire, but the eastern part continued to be a part of the Safavid Empire.\nThe Ottoman government gave Idris Bitlisi authority to get help from the Kurdish emirs. The Kurdish emirs sent their soldiers to help the Ottomans. In the first half of the 16th century, many important Kurdish soldiers fought against the Safavids' allies in Kurdistan. The Ottoman government made variable allowances for the autonomy of Kurdish emirs and tribes in their own lands. There was also an Ottoman governor in each province. The emirs of Bitlis, Hakkari, and the emirate of Bohtan (Cizre) did not have to pay tax to the Ottoman government. Other tribes did pay tax, but the Ottoman government gave their \"Kurdish counties\" () as fiefs () to Kurdish tribes' own leaders, who inherited their position. For the Ottoman Empire at this time, the Kurds were useful as allies on the border with the Safavid Empire. The Ottomans had success in getting Kurdish allies, and the Safavids gave the Kurds better treatment in order to get the same result. Some parts of Iranian Kurdistan became parts of the provinces of the Safavid Empire, but others had Kurdish governors who inherited their positions. The Ardalan clan of Sanandaj and the Mukriyani tribes of west Azerbaijan both had Kurdish governors of this kind. The sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, took away the authority of the Kurdish emir of Bitlis, so he and his clan went to the Safavid Empire, where the shah gave them good treatment and gave the emir's grandson education at the royal court. The Safavid government gave the emir's grandson, Sharaf Khan Bidlisi, authority for the Kurds at the royal court, and gave him a title: \"the high emir of the Kurds\" (). However, Sharaf Khan Bidlisi later returned to his grandfather's emirate in Bitlis, defecting from the Safavid Empire to the Ottoman Empire.\nSome Safavid shahs forced Kurdish tribes to migrate to Khorasan to the east of the Safavids' lands. There they set up Kurdish emirates which defended the border against attacks from the Turkmen and Uzbek tribes. The government moved many Kurds there in the 16th century, in order to make the Kurds fight against the Uzbek people who were then attacking Iran. Abbas the Great, the shah, moved tens of thousands of Kurds from Iranian Kurdistan to the borders of Afghanistan and the land that is now Turkmenistan. Shah Abbas's government did this between 1598 and 1610. The Safavid government continued to threaten the Ottoman government's control in Kurdistan.\nIt was most common for the Ottomans to use the Turkoman people to control the population, but they also used Kurds. Ali Janbulad was a Kurdish warlord from Kilis. He fought in the Ottoman armies, and controlled the Ottoman army in Palestine. The Ottomans tried to settle the nomadic people and tried to make them become farmers. The Kurds, however, started to have firearms in the 1580s and 1590s. Kurdish lords became more powerful and started to control the trade routes between Mosul, Baghdad, Aleppo, and Adana. Kurdish lords controlled the mountain lands between the inland cities of Syria (Aleppo, Damascus, Hama and Homs) and the ports of the Mediterranean Sea (Payas, Iskenderun, Antioch, Latakia, Tripoli). Kurdish traders carried the imports and exports, and Kurdish tribes sometimes attacked the trade routes. Kurdish soldiers attacked the river trade route of the Tigris, and the Yazidis on the way between Mosul and Aleppo always gave resistance to the Ottoman government. The mountain roads were sometimes impossible to pass through for months or years because of the Kurdish lords. Travellers would bribe the Kurds, and take hostages. The Ottoman government did not have success in trying to control the roads with the army and with fortifications. The Ottoman government sometimes gave Kurdish warlords government authority, so that they might do as the government wanted. After 1600, the power of the Ottoman governors in Aleppo and Mosul was weak, so each governor had an army. The cavalry in these armies were mostly Kurds from the area of Kilis. However, when governors went away after their term of office, their armies' veterans became unemployed and many became bandits in rural areas. Banditry from Kurds and Bedouins was so common in the early 18th century that the population of farmers around Homs and Hama became smaller and there was not enough food in Damascus as a result.\nThe Safavid Empire started to become weak at the end of the 17th century. The authority of the government became weak, and some Kurdish tribes were able to take power for themselves. Attacks from Afghans started in 1709. At the time of these attacks, Kurdish tribes were able to take control of some lands from the Safavid government. In 1719, Kurds took control of Hamadan and the tribes were able to move almost to Isfahan. The Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire both took control of lands in the north and west of Iran. The Russian Empire's armies took control of Derbent and Baku in the years 1722 and 1723. They were also able to move to Rasht. The Safavid dynasty's downfall was in 1735. Nader Shah, the first \"shah\" of the Afsharid dynasty, went to try to stop a rebellion among the Kurds in 1747. (He was assassinated on his way.)\nFrom the 1790s, Ardalan rulers (\"wali\"s) were an important part of the political support for the Qajar dynasty. The Qajar dynasty started to come to power in Iran in the 1790s. The Qajar rulers took hostages from the tribes to keep the Kurdish rulers' loyalty. The Qajar Empire continued to lose lands to the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Both of these empires wanted to control Kurdistan and Azerbaijan. The Qajar Empire lost most of the land to the north of the Aras () river before 1800. \nDuring the 18th century, the Kurdish emirate of Baban came into power in the Shahrizor area. Its capital city was Sulaymaniyah. In 1821, the emir of Baban defected from the Ottoman Empire to the Qajar Empire. The emir started to help Abbas Mirza, the crown prince of Iran and the Qajar governor of Azerbaijan. The emir's defection caused a war to start between the Ottomans and the Qajars (the 1821\u20131823 Ottoman\u2013Persian War).\nDuring the early modern period, the importance of the Baban emirate in the later 18th century was one of the reasons for the growth of the Sorani Kurdish dialect. From Amadiya's emirate came poetry in the Kurmanji Kurdish dialect. The rulers of the Ardalan emirate were patrons of poetry in the Gorani Kurdish dialect. \nWorking with the Kurds in Anatolia, Kurds in Syria came to control most of the trade in livestock and in the galls of oak trees across the region. (The oak galls traded at Aleppo and were exports to Europe for making into ink. The livestock they sold for meat.) In the cities of the region, Kurdish lords and landlords became powerful leaders with authority over the Kurdish people who lived in and came to the city.\nIn the past, people feared the Kurds. In the Middle Ages, people thought of the Kurds as being bandits. In the 18th century, people in Aleppo and Mosul would say that Kurds were as dangerous as rats and locusts. People in Aleppo would also say the Kurds were like the Bedouin (a group of nomadic people). They would say: \"Four were born to do mischief: rats, locusts, Bedouin and Kurds\". Because of this, and because many Kurds were in military units, Kurds often lived outside the defensive walls of big cities like Aleppo and Damascus. Many of the veterans of Ottoman governors' private armies who became bandits were Arabs and Turkomans as well as Kurds, but Kurds were the group most connected with the problem. People in northern Syria and Mesopotamia thought of themselves as different from the Kurds, who did not have a good reputation. These differences were in existence into the 21st century.\n19th century.\nIn the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire and the Qajar Empire both started reforms. The reforms' purpose was to modernize each empire, because both had started to have less power than the Great Powers of the Western world. The reforms meant that the governments took away the autonomy of the Kurdish rulers and the existence of the Kurdish emirates ended. Muslims, including Kurds, feared the successes of the Western powers, and feared the power that Christian empires had. The Tanzimat reforms were part of a new, secular nationalism, in the Ottoman Empire, and this made many traditional Muslim Kurds unhappy. Nationalism among the Ottoman Empire's Christian Armenian people also caused unhappiness to grow among the Kurds. The power of Sufism grew among the Kurds. As a result of the reforms, a social class of Kurdish intellectuals and professionals came into existence with the development of Western education. Many of this new class were descendants of the families that had been the rulers of emirates. Many of these Kurds joined the new institutions of the Ottoman state, including the army. For these Kurds, there was some cultural assimilation with the other people who formed the empire's government social class. Among these Kurds too was also the start of Kurdish political nationalism.\nIn the Qajar Empire, this reform process was not as fast as it was in the Ottoman Empire. The Qajar Empire got help from Europe to make military reforms in the Qajar army. In 1812, the Qajar Empire tried to take back lands from the Russian Empire when the armies of Napoleon's First French Empire were attacking Russia. The British Empire helped the Qajar Empire with its reforms in the early the 19th century because the Russian Empire's growth was a threat to the British Empire's control of India. In 1828 (after the Russo-Persian War), the Russian Empire took control of all the lands and all the Kurdish tribes to the north of the Aras river. This was the agreement of the Treaty of Turkmenchay. The influence of the Russian Empire was growing in the north of Kurdistan, and the influence of the British Empire was growing in the south of Kurdistan. Many of the Kurdish rulers on the border between the Ottoman Empire and the Qajar Empire chose to work with the Ottoman Empire. This was because the most of the Kurds in the north of Kurdistan were part of Sunni Islam, like the Ottoman dynasty's sultan (and caliph) in Constantinople. (Other Kurds in the south of Kurdistan were part of Shia Islam, like the shah in Tehran.) The Kurdish rulers thought that the Ottoman government would not be as able to tax or conscript their tribes, because the Qajar government in Tehran was nearer than the Ottoman government in Constantinople. Both governments helped rebels who had fought against the other government. For the governments of both empires, controlling the Kurdish lands on the border with their armies was not possible.\nThe provinces and government of the Ottoman Empire started to have a different organization because of the reforms that Sultan Mahmud II started. His government named new governors for the provinces, and took away the authority of the Kurdish emirs and governors. There was a lot of fighting against this and the Ottoman army started to attack the Kurdish emirs. In the Qajar Empire, the existence of the Kurdish emirates in Khorasan ended in the first half of the 19th century. The Ardalan clan continued to control Sanandaj until the 1860s. At that time, the Qajar government ended the clan's inherited position as governor.\nDuring the 19th century, farmers started to grow new crops that had greater profits. Farmers started to grow \"Nicotiana tabacum\" (tobacco), and farming became more common. At the middle of the 19th century, about a third of the population of Iranian Kurdistan were nomadic people. Many of the crops from Iranian Kurdistan (grains, fruits, and nuts) went out of the Qajar Empire as exports along the trade route between Tabriz and the Black Sea at Trabzon. Carriage of the exports from Kurdistan to the sea was by draught animals. The peasant farmers grew the crops, and the nomads of the tribes supplied the domestic animals for the crops' transport. (The peasant farmers also had to pay taxes and extortion to the tribes.) In 1870, 40% of Iran's international trade went through Iranian Kurdistan on the Tabriz\u2013Trabzon trade route. However, from that time the trade route became less important. The Russian Empire completed a new railway from Baku (on the Caspian Sea) to Tbilisi and then to Poti (on the Black Sea). The British and French empires completed the Suez Canal in 1869, and because of this, many exports started to go to the Persian Gulf at Bushehr or through Baghdad at Basra. These two new trade routes meant that Kurds did not profit from the exports and the Kurdish tribes became more weak. \nBedir Khan Bey was the emir of Cizre (the emirate of Bohtan). Bedir Khan Bey, the emir of Hakkari, and the emir of M\u00fbk\u00fbs all took part in a rebellion against the Ottoman government. Bedir Khan Bey started the rebellion in 1842, but in 1846 the Ottomans took him prisoner and he went into exile. In 1849, the government took away the authority of Hakkari's emir, Nurullah Bey. The Ottoman government also took away the power of the Baban emirate, and they took control of Sulaymaniyah themselves. In the towns and cities, the Ottoman and Qajar governments of Kurdistan started new schools, newspapers, law courts, and government councils. In the countryside however, where most Kurds lived, modernization brought new taxes and conscription into the army. Sufi religious leaders \u2013 sheikhs \u2013 started to have more power in Kurdistan. Some Kurdish sheikhs helped the Ottoman army fight the army of the Russian Empire during the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). However, Kurdish sheikhs also worked against the government. One sheikh who had fought for the Ottoman side in the war, Sheikh Ubeydullah, started a rebellion against the Ottoman government.\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War, the government in both parts of Kurdistan (Ottoman Kurdistan and Iranian Kurdistan) lost control of the land. After the war there was a famine. There was also a rumour that the Ottoman Empire was going to recognize a new state for the Armenians. Armenians were the largest minority in parts of Kurdistan. At that time, Sheikh Ubeydullah started his rebellion. He hoped to start new Kurdish state whose lands would be both Ottoman Kurdistan and Iranian Kurdistan. The rebellion ended without having this success. The Shi'ite Qajar government punished the Sunni Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan when they took control again. In Ottoman Kurdistan, Sultan Abdul Hamid II started to get support from Muslims by using Islamism, going against the secularization of the modernization reforms. The sultan's government tried to get friends among the Kurdish tribes. In 1891, the sultan started a new Ottoman military unit in the cavalry: the \"Hamidiye.\" Many Kurdish men from the tribes started to work for the government in the \"Hamidiye\". Abdul Hamid II gave the \"Hamidiye\" his own name.\nThe Ottoman government gave the \"Hamidiye\" and the Kurdish tribes' rulers power because the government feared the growth of Armenian nationalism. The \"Hamidiye\" became famous across the world when they took part in pogroms, attacking the Armenian people in the east of Anatolia between 1894 and 1896. The government gave many tribes' rulers good treatment. Sheikh Said Berzinci became the ruler of Sulaymaniyah, and had a good relationship with the Ottoman government in Mosul. Said Berzinci became the most important of the government's friends in the Mosul Vilayet. Milli Ibrahim Pasha was ruler from the tribes; he was an important military officer in the \"Hamidiye\" and a friend of the sultan. The power, tyranny, and violence of the \"Hamidiye\" and some of the Kurdish tribes' rulers made some other Kurds unhappy. Many of the Kurdish professionals and intellectuals were part of the constitutionalist political groups. They were against the Islamism of Sultan Abdul Hamid and the autocracy of his government.\nTwo Kurds, Abdullah Cevdet and \u0130shak S\u00fckuti were part of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) from its start. The CUP was the most important organization in the Ottoman Empire to want a revolution. The first Kurdish newspaper was \"Kurdistan\" which started in 1898. The writings in the newspaper supported constitutionalism and the CUP, and the CUP gave money and other help to the newspaper's publishers. However, writings in the newspaper also spoke of Kurdish culture and Kurdish politics for the Kurdish intelligentsia. The publishers of \"Kurdistan\" were two sons of the old emir of Cizre, Bedir Khan Bey. His sons were Mikdad Midhat Bedir Khan and Abdurrahman Bedir Khan, and both had worked in the Ottoman government. Their newspaper made the argument that constitutionalism was the answer to the Kurds' problems.\nIn Iranian Kurdistan, chiefs and men from the tribes started to become farmers and landlords. By 1900, most of the men of the tribes had become peasants on lands a landlord owned. Some of the tribes' chiefs went to live in cities: some worked with the local government. In the second half of the 19th century, the Tabriz\u2013Trabzon trade route through Iranian Kurdistan became less important because of the Suez Canal and the new railways in the Russian Empire. In 1900, the Tabriz\u2013Trabzon trade route was responsible for only 10% of Iran's international trade.\n20th century.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century's first decade, the political power of constitutionalism in Qajar Iran and Ottoman Turkey became very strong. In Ottoman Kurdistan, some Kurds took part in tax resistance revolts that did not have success. In Iran, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah made a constitution in December 1906 after there were many protests in the country during 1905. However, Mohammad Ali Shah became Iran's ruler when Mozaffar ad-Din Shah died, and the new shah ended the constitution and the new parliament in 1908. The Russian Empire and the British Empire helped Mohammad Ali Shah take power. By that time, the Qajar government's power was weak, and it had lost control in Iranian Kurdistan. Many Kurdish rebels came there from Ottoman Kurdistan, where the control of the government was more complete. In June 1908, a constitutionalist rebellion in the Ottoman military started. There were connections between this rebellion and the CUP. The rebellion forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to set up a parliament and a constitutionalist government. The end of Abdul Hamid's autocracy was important for many Kurds living in the capital city, Constantinople. Many of them supported the CUP and the new constitution. A number of Kurdish organizations then started in Constantinople. The Society for Kurdish Mutual-Aid and Progress (SKMP) was in existence from September 1908 until 1909. The Society for the Propagation of Kurdish Education (SPKE) was in existence from 1910 to 1911. The Kurdish Students' Hope Society, however, was in existence from 1912 until the start of World War I.\nIn Constantinople, the political Kurds supported the Ottoman Empire and the constitutional government. In Ottoman Kurdistan, other Kurds were not as happy with the revolution. The CUP wanted to take away the power of the \"Hamidiye\". The government planned to end the existence of the \"Hamidiye\" itself. Many rulers from the tribes feared that they would lose their power. Many Kurds from the tribes joined local Kurdish organizations in 1908 and 1909. Although these \"clubs\" were part of the constitutionalist SKMP organization, they started to work against the constitutional government. The club at Bitlis started a rebellion against the CUP. After that, the government forced the clubs' existence to end. The existence of the \"Hamidiye\" continued, although the government took away more of its power. The government also planned to give lands to Armenian farmers, whose lands Kurdish tribes took in the past. Many Kurds started to think that constitutionalism was helping the Armenians but not helping the Kurds. Many Muslim Kurds thought the CUP was irreligious, and thought the empire was becoming weak. Italy overcame the Ottomans in the Italo-Turkish War (1911\u20131912). The Balkan League (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro) overcame the Ottomans in the First Balkan War (1912\u20131913). In these wars, the Ottoman Empire lost many lands in Africa and Europe.\nStarting in 1911, Abd\u00fcrrezzak Bedir Khan (another descendant of Bedir Khan Bey) was moving through Kurdistan and the Ottoman\u2013Qajar border. He set up a network of important men from the tribes, which worked for an independent Kurdistan. Abd\u00fcrrezzak Bedir Khan hoped to get help for this plan from the Russian Empire. Simko Shikak, Sheikh Taha of Nehri, and Sheikh Abd\u00fcsselam Barzani all joined Abd\u00fcrrezzak Bedir Khan in having this plan. They did not start a rebellion, but they were an important danger to the government. However, the position of the Kurds in Ottoman Kurdistan and in Iranian Kurdistan changed with the start of World War I.\nDuring World War I, Kurdistan became a battlefield. The armies of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire fought in Ottoman Kurdistan and in Iranian Kurdistan. After the Battle of Sarikamish (January 1915), the Russian army took control of many Ottoman lands. Kurds fought in the Ottoman army across the empire. Many Kurds fought as conscripts in the Ottoman army against the Russian armies. Others fought in the Ottoman army in Mesopotamia. When the Ottoman Empire asked for their help, other Kurds in the tribes of Iranian Kurdistan fought against the Russian Empire there. Kurdish tribes fought for the Ottomans in the Battle of Dilman (April 1915). Other Kurds helped the Russian armies. Abd\u00fcrrezzak Bedir Khan was one of those who helped the Russians. The Russian Empire made Abd\u00fcrrezzak Bedir Khan governor of Erzurum when the Russians took military control of that city. Many people in the Kurdish population were persecuted by the Russian army and by Armenian partisans fighting with the Russians. Other Kurds were persecuted by the CUP Ottoman government. The government wanted to Turkify the Kurds, and in 1916, the CUP wanted the Kurdish refugees from the war to separate from one another to make Turkification more easy. Many Kurds themselves took part in the Armenian Genocide, a genocide planned by the government. Armenians were the largest minority in parts of Kurdistan before the Armenian Genocide.\nAfter the Russian Revolutions in 1917, the Ottomans again took control over some lands Russians controlled. The Ottomans executed Abd\u00fcrrezzak Bedir Khan. However, in Mesopotamia the British Empire took control of Baghdad. The British military was on its way to Mosul when the Ottoman government surrendered, and made an armistice (the Armistice of Mudros) with the Allies of World War I in October 1918. Simko Shikak took control of lands in Iranian Kurdistan near Lake Urmia. (Simko Shikak kept control of these lands until 1920.) In December 1918, Kurds in Constantinople started the Society for the Betterment of Kurdistan (SBK). The power in this organization was in two parts: a Kurdish nationalist political faction and another faction which supported the Ottoman Empire's existence. The son of Sheikh Ubeydullah, Sheikh Abd\u00fclkadir, was the leader of the Ottoman faction of the SBK. Bedir Khan Beg's son, Emin Ali Bedir Khan, was the leader of the SBK's nationalist faction.\nIn the north of Ottoman Kurdistan, in Anatolia, the power of Mustafa Kemal (Atat\u00fcrk) was growing. Mustafa Kemal's Kemalist (Turkish nationalist) armies fought against the First Republic of Armenia. In this fight, the help of Kurds was important for the Kemalists' success. The Kemalists got help from the Kurds by saying that the Armenians wanted their land, and by saying that the Great Powers (the Allies of World War I) wanted Kurdistan to become part of the new Armenian state. In August 1919 Kurdish leaders were at the Erzurum Congress, and in September 1919 they were at the Sivas Congress.\nAt the Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920), the SBK's representative was \u015eerif Pasha. With the representatives of the Armenians, \u015eerif Pasha made an agreement about the lands of a new Kurdish state and the lands of a new Armenian state. A possible Kurdish state in Ottoman Kurdistan was one of the agreements in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres (August 1920). However, other Kurds did not support the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. They were unhappy that lands of a Muslim empire were going to have a Christian government when they became parts of Armenia. Some Kurdish leaders sent telegrams to Paris to say that they were not in agreement with the Treaty of S\u00e8vres.\nIn both the south and the north of Ottoman Kurdistan, new powers were in development. In the north, the Kemalists were taking control. In the south, the British Empire was in control. The son of Said Berzinci, Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji was the leader of the Kurdish nationalists in Sulaymaniyah. The British Empire overcame the rebellion of Mahmud Barzanji, and the south of Kurdistan became part (Iraqi Kurdistan) of the new Kingdom of Iraq. In 1921, the Kemalists overcame a Kurdish rebellion (the Ko\u00e7giri rebellion) in the area of Ko\u00e7giri (near Sivas). By 1923, the Kemalist government was in control of all Anatolia. After the Kemalist armies overcame the Kingdom of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922), the Allies ended their Occupation of Constantinople in 1923. Then the Kemalists took control of the capital city. The new government in Constantinople ended the existence of many Kurdish organizations. Many Kurds went into exile.\nAs a result of the Kemalists' military success, the Treaty of Lausanne (July 1923) took the place of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. The Treaty of Lausanne did not set up an independent Kurdistan or give autonomy to the Kurds. The Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway became the border between the new Turkish Republic and the French Empire. The Kurdish lands between Aleppo and Antep became part (Syrian Kurdistan) of the French Empire. The parts of Kurdistan to the north of the railway became part (Turkish Kurdistan) of the new Turkish state. The Kemalist government ended the Ottoman caliphate March 1924. The division of the Ottoman Empire's Kurds and of Ottoman Kurdistan was complete when the League of Nations gave Mosul and its Kurdish lands to the Kingdom of Iraq in 1926. The division of Kurdistan and the Kurdish population into four (Turkish Kurdistan, Iranian Kurdistan, Iraqi Kurdistan and Syrian Kurdistan) continues to exist. \nReligion.\nIn Classical Antiquity, the most important deities of the Kurds' lands were Ahura Mazda and Mithra. The most common religion was Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism was probably the state religion of the Achaemenid Empire. There are connections between the writings of Zoroastrianism and the Vedas, the Hindu writings of ancient India.\nIn Late Antiquity before the 7th century, Kurds had many different religious beliefs. There were Christians and Zoroastrians. There were also Kurdish Jews. Some sects among the Kurdish Christians and Jews had religious beliefs from Zoroastrianism and Mithraism in their religion. There may have been Kurds among the Companions of the Prophet (the people who knew Muhammad).\nThe Muslim conquests by Arab armies in the 7th century meant that most Kurds became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries. Most Kurds converted to Islam between the 7th and 9th centuries CE. Kurds who were not Muslim had to pay the jizya, a tax. Most of these were part of the Shafi'ite system of Islamic jurisprudence. However, although most Kurds are Muslims and part of Sunni Islam, there are also Kurds of many other religions and sects.\nThere are Kurdish Jews in Iraqi Kurdistan and in Israel."}

Sets are collections of objects. We refer to these objects as \"elements\" or \"members\" of the set. To write a set, one wraps the numbers in {curly brackets}, and separates them with commas. For example. the set holds 1, 2, and 3. Sets are also often referred to using capital roman letters such as formula_1, formula_2, formula_3.\nThere are three methods one can use to describe a set: Description method, Roster method (tabular form) and Rule method (set builder form).\nHistory.\nSet theory was created around 1874 by Georg Cantor. It had to be made better because collections of objects can cause problems if we work with them without explaining them better. Russell's paradox was one of the problems. Think about the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. If it were inside itself, then the rule which defines it would mean that it is \"not\" inside itself. But, if it were not inside itself, then the rule which defines it would mean that it \"is\" inside itself. This was a serious problem, and it meant that the old set theory was broken.\nIt was improved by people including Zermelo and Bertrand Russell.\nTheory.\nSet theory begins by giving some examples of things that are sets. Then it gives rules in which you can make other sets from the already known sets. Collections of objects that are not sets are called (proper) classes. It is possible to do mathematics using only sets, rather than classes, so that the problems that classes cause in mathematics do not occur.\nA binary relation between two sets is the subset relation, also called \"set inclusion\". If all the members of set are also members of set , then is a \"subset\" of , marking . For example, is a subset of , but is not. From this example, it is clear that a set is a subset of itself. In cases where one wishes to not to have this, the term \"proper subset\" is meant not to have this possibility.\nThe self-considering objects in set theory was considered too, with some example numbers being 1={1}, 2={1, 2}, 3={1, 2, 3} and so on."}

It is made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The Boeing 747 has more than one aisle, which means it is a wide-body aircraft. It is often called the \"Jumbo Jet\" or \"Queen of the Skies\". The Boeing 747 is one of the easiest planes in the world to recognise. It was the first wide-body aircraft ever made. The first type of 747 was two and a half times the size of the Boeing 707. The Boeing 747 made its first flight for an airline in 1970. The 747 could carry more people than any other aircraft for 37 years, until the Airbus A380 was made.\nThe 747 is a double deck plane. It can carry people, cargo and many other things. Boeing designed the 747's upper deck to be a first class lounge or just extra seats. They also designed the upper deck so that the aircraft could be changed into a cargo plane easily. This was done by removing seats and putting in a cargo door at the front of the plane. Boeing did this because they thought that supersonic airliners would become much more popular than the 747 and other subsonic airliners. However, they thought that subsonic cargo planes would always be popular. It was thought that the 747 would become unpopular after 400 were sold. However, 1,000 planes had been made by 1993, so it stayed popular. By September 2012, 1,448 aircraft had been built. 81 747-8s were still waiting to be built.\nThe 747-400 is one of the fastest airliners being used today. It usually flies at Mach 0.85\u20130.855 (up to ). It can fly for 7,260\u00a0nautical miles (8,350\u00a0mi or 13,450\u00a0km). The newest version of the 747, the 747\u20138, is now being made.\nThe 747 will be replaced by the Boeing Y3 (part of the Boeing Yellowstone Project) eventually.\nDevelopment.\nBackground.\nIn 1963, the United States Air Force began to look for a very big plane to transport things. At that time, they were using the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. However, the Air Force thought that a much bigger plane which could carry more cargo was needed. The Air Force called the big plane the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS). It needed to be able to carry of cargo and travel at Mach 0.75 (). It also had to be able to fly for while carrying of cargo. The cargo bay had to be wide, high and long. There had to be doors for the bay at the front and the back of the plane.\nThe Air Force also wanted the plane to have only four engines. This meant that new engines had to be made. On May 18, 1964, Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed and Martin Marietta designed a plane. General Electric, Curtiss-Wright and Pratt &amp; Whitney designed the engines. The Air Force liked Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed's designs. They also liked General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney's engine designs.\nIn 1965, Lockheed's plane and General Electric's engines were used for the C-5 Galaxy. At that time, it was the biggest military cargo plane in the world.\nAirliner.\nThe idea for the 747 was thought of in the 1960s. Jets like the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 had made it easy to travel long distances. Juan Trippe from Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), asked Boeing to build a plane which was more than two times bigger than the Boeing 707. At this time, airports were very busy. Trippe thought that a big plane could help make them quieter.\nIn 1965, Joe Sutter was told to design this new plane. It was called the 747. Sutter asked Pan Am and other airlines what they would like from the plane. At the time, it was thought that supersonic aircraft would replace the 747. Because of this, Boeing made the 747 so that it could easily be turned into a cargo plane if the passenger version became less popular.\nIn April 1966, Pan Am bought 25 747-100 planes. The order cost US$525\u00a0million. Since Pan Am was the launch customer, Pan Am had a big say in the design and making of the 747. No other airline before then or since then has been able to have so much influence over a plane.\nDesigning.\nThe design that Boeing made for the Air Force in 1963 was not used for the 747. However, Boeing made some new things for the Air Force which were used in the 747. The first design had two full decks. However, in 1966, this was changed to only one deck. The cockpit was put above the deck, which made a \"bulge\". There was a small space behind the cockpit which people could sit in. At first, it was a \"lounge\" area with no seats.\nPlanes as big as the 747 needed high-bypass turbofan engines. High-bypass turbofans can produce twice the power of turbojets, and also use a lot less fuel. General Electric made the first of these engines. However, it was making the engines for the C-5 Galaxy. It did not make engines for airliners until later. Pratt &amp; Whitney was also working on this type of engine. In 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt &amp; Whitney designed a new engine, the JT9D, for the 747.\nBoeing used some special devices to make the plane make more lift. This was done so that the 747 could take off from shorter runways. The 747 has a lot of flaps on the wing. The flaps make the wings bigger by 21 percent. They also make 90 percent more lift when they are used.\nBoeing tried to give the 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969. This meant that Boeing only had 28 months to design the aircraft. The people who worked on the 747 had the nickname \"The Incredibles\".\nFactory.\nBoeing did not have a factory big enough to make the new plane. Boeing thought about putting their factory in 50 different cities. They eventually decided to build their factory in Seattle, near Everett, Washington. Boeing bought the factory in June 1966.\nDesigning the 747 was very difficult. Building its factory was also not easy. Boeing's president, William M. Allen, asked Malcolm T. Stamper to be in charge of the building of the Everett factory. He was also asked to begin building the 747. The factory is the biggest building ever built (by volume). It has been made bigger many times so that Boeing can build even bigger planes.\nDevelopment and testing.\nBefore the first 747 was put together, parts and systems were being tested. In one important test, 560 volunteers evacuated a replica of a 747 cabin using the emergency chutes. The first evacuation took two and a half minutes. However, the FAA says that the maximum time for an evacuation is 90 seconds. Many of the volunteers were hurt. More evacuations happened, and they eventually reached the 90 seconds. However, they also caused a lot of injuries. Evacuating from the top deck of the plane was difficult. Instead of using the usual slides, the volunteers had to leave the plane using a harness. The plane's taxiing also had to be tested. Boeing made \"Waddell's Wagon\" (named after a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) to train the pilots. \"Waddell's Wagon\" was a replica of a 747 cockpit which was put on the roof of a truck. This helped pilots to learn how to taxi the plane.\nOn September 30, 1968, the first 747 was finished. People from the 26 airlines that had ordered the 747 were also there. The 747 first flew on February 9, 1969. Its pilots were Jack Waddell and Brien Wygle. There was a small problem with the flaps, but the 747 handled well.\nThe testing was delayed because of some problems with the JT9D engines. For example, the engines stalled if the throttles were moved too quickly. This meant that 747s could not be delivered for many more months. 20 planes were stuck at the factory while they were waiting on engines. On December 13, 1969 the test plane was being taken to have some changes made to it. The pilot, Ralph C. Cokely landed too early and did not reach the runway. One of the landing gears was ripped off, and two of the engines were damaged. However, Boeing took the 747 to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969. There, the public saw the 747 for the first time.\nDesigning the 747 and building the new factory cost a lot of money. This meant that Boeing had to borrow a lot of money from a bank. Just before the first aircraft was finished, Boeing had to keep asking for more money. If Boeing was not given this money, the company could have collapsed. Boeing was in over $2 billion in debt. Allen said, \"It was really too large a project for us.\" However, the 747 program was a success. Boeing was the only company to make very big planes for many years.\nUse by airlines.\nThe very first time a 747 was used by an airline was on January 22, 1970. Pan Am used it to fly from New York to London. The flight was supposed to happen on the evening of January 21. However, the engines on the aircraft overheated. Pan Am had to find another plane, which took six hours.\nThe 747 did quite well when it first began to be used. Some people thought that airports would not be able to handle such a big plane. However, they could. There were some problems, but they were quite small and they were fixed quickly. After Pan Am began to use the plane, other airlines began to use their 747s. Boeing thought that a lot of 747s would be sold because airlines wanted a plane which could fly for a long time, not because it was so big.\nThe recession of 1969-1970 was very bad for Boeing. For over a year after September 1970, it only sold two 747s. None were sold to an American airline for over three years. Some airlines did not have enough passengers to fly the 747. Therefore, they replaced them with the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. American Airlines eventually only used its 747s to carry cargo. In 1983, AA gave its 747s to Pan Am. Pan Am gave American Airlines some smaller planes. Delta Air Lines also stopped using its 747s after many years. Delta would later merge with Northwest Airlines, which operates 747s.\nFlights which landed in smaller cities became quite usual in the 1980s. This was bad for the 747. However, many airlines still used the 747 to fly across the Pacific.\nUpgrades made to the 747.\nThe first type of 747 was called the 747\u2013100. After this, Boeing made the , which has a higher MTOW (maximum takeoff weight), and the (Short Range). The -100SR could carry more passengers. A higher MTOW means that the plane can carry more fuel and fly further. In 1971, Boeing made the . It had better engines and a higher MTOW. Airliner and cargo versions of the were made. The 747SP (special performance) was also made. It began being used in 1976.\nIn 1980, Boeing made the 747\u2013300. The first 747-300 was made in 1983. Its upper deck was longer, it flew faster and it could hold more passengers. The \u2212300 was first called the 747SUD for \"stretched upper deck\". Then it was called the 747-200 SUD, then the 747EUD, and finally it was called the 747\u2013300.\nIn 1985, Boeing began to design the 747-400. This type has a glass cockpit. This meant that only two people were needed in the cockpit. It also had new engines and a new cabin. The workers who made the 747-400 were not very experienced and Boeing wanted them to work for longer than they needed to. This meant that there were some problems with the first 747-400s. The \u2212400 began being used by airlines in 1989.\nIn 1991, 1,087 passengers were taken to Israel on a 747. This was a part of Operation Solomon. The Antonov An-225 cargo transport is the world's biggest plane. The Hughes H-4 Hercules has the biggest wingspan, but it only flew once.\nMore developments.\nSince the 747-400 was made, many more types of 747 have been suggested. Boeing said that they would make the 747-500X and in 1996. These new planes would have cost more than US$5\u00a0billion to design and make. Airlines did not like it enough, so Boeing decided not to make the planes. In 2000, Boeing said it would make a 747X to rival the Airbus A3XX. However, airlines did not like the 747X enough, so it was cancelled. A year later, Boeing began concentrating on the Sonic Cruiser. The Sonic Cruiser was stopped, so Boeing then focused on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Some of the ideas that Boeing had for the 747X were used on the 747-400ER.\nIn 2004, Boeing said that it might work on the 747 Advanced. Boeing decided to go ahead with this. The 747 Advanced used some things from the 787 to make the 747's design more modern. The 747 was the world's biggest passenger plane until the Airbus A380 was finished in 2007.\nOn November 14, 2005, Boeing said it had changed the name of the 747 Advanced to the Boeing 747-8. The last 747-400s were made in 2009. On February 8, 2010, the 747-8 Freighter made its first flight. Cargolux got the first 747\u20138 in 2011. Eventually, the 747 will be replaced by \"Y3\".\nDesign.\nThe Boeing 747 is a big, wide-body airliner. It has four engines on the wings, and the wings are swept at 37.5 degrees, so the 747 can fly very fast. The sweep also means that the 747 does not need any special hangars.\nSince the cockpit is above the main deck, it makes a \"hump\", and because it is so high, the plane can have a cargo door installed at the front.\nThe 747-100 can fly for 5,300\u00a0nautical miles (6,100\u00a0mi, 9,800\u00a0km), and the 747-8i can fly for 8,000\u00a0nmi (9,200\u00a0mi, 14,815\u00a0km).\nThe 747 has special flaps, which allow the 747 to fly slowly and land on normal runways. A 747 can carry a fifth engine on the wing, but it cannot be used.\nTypes of Boeing 747.\nThe 747-100 was the very first type of 747, which was made in 1966. The 747\u2013200, the next version, was made in 1968. The 747-300 was made in 1980 and the 747-400 was made in 1985. The newest version, the 747\u20138, was announced in 2005. These types also have smaller sub-types. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) names these planes by combining the model number of the plane with its type number. For example, the 747-100 is \"B741\" and the 747-400 is \"B744\".\n747-100.\nThe first 747-100s had six windows on the upper deck. Later, airlines began to use the upper deck to hold more people instead of using it as a lounge. Boeing then made an upper deck with ten windows. Some \u2212100s had the new ten-window upper deck installed after the plane was made (retrofitted). The \u2212100 had Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-3A engines. Boeing did not make a freighter version of the 747\u2013100, but some airlines have turned some 747-100s into freighters. 167 747-100s were made.\n747-100SR.\nAfter Japanese airlines requested an aircraft to fly routes between major cities in Japan, Boeing produced the -100SR. This model flies shorter distances, but is able to carry more passengers. The first -100SR started flying with Japan Air Lines (JAL) on October 7, 1973. The -100SR had four General Electric CF6-45A2 or Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A engines. A total of 7 -100SR were produced.\nLater, Boeing designed a type of -100SR with the ability of taking off with greater weight. This was the -100BSR. It was first delivered to All Nippon Airways (ANA) on December 21, 1978. 20 -100BSR were delivered to JAL and ANA.\nIn 1986, 2 -100BSR with stretched upper deck (SUD) from the -300 series were delivered to JAL. It was the last -100SR/BSR ever built. The last delivery was to JAL, in September 1986. There were a total of 29 -100SR/BSR made.\n747SP.\nThe 747SP (SP means special performance) is designed as Pan Am and Iran Air both wanted a wide-body plane that can fly long distances; from New York to the Middle East (for Pan Am) and Tehran to New York (for Iran Air). The first 747SP was produced on May 19, 1975. Its first flight was on July 4. On this flight, it flew at a top speed of Mach 0.92 (). It started flying people on April 25, 1976, after being delivered on March 5. Now, it is not often used.\nA total of 45 747SP were made and used by airlines like Qantas, China Airlines, Air China, and South African Airways.\n747-200.\nAfter the -100 were made, Boeing started making -200. The -200 has a longer range, but still carries the same number of people. This is because airlines said the -100 could not fly long distances. The -200 is made in passenger type (-200B), freighter type (-200F), Combi type (A plane that carries both cargo and people; -200M) and convertible type (a plane that can be easily changed to carry cargo; -200C).\nThe first -200B was finished on September 10, 1970 before its first flight on October 11 and finally, it started being used by KLM. Boeing then started making the other types of -200. The -200F first flight was on November 30, 1971, 7 days after it was finished. It was then delivered to Lufthansa.\nThe -200C first flew on March 23, 1973 before being delivered to World Airways in May the same year. Finally, the -200M had its first flight on November 11, 1974 before being delivered to Air Canada.\nThere was a total of 393 -200 series ever made,which includes 225 -200B, 78 -200M, 73 -200F, 13 -200C and 4 military.\n747-300.\nThe 747-300 is a stretched upper deck version of the 747\u2013200. It was designed to fit more passengers on the upper deck. The 747-300 also has updated General Electric CF6-80C2 engines. Otherwise, there are not many differences between the 747-200 and 747\u2013300. The 747-300 has a length of 231 feet 10 inches and a wingspan of 195 feet 8 inches.\n747-400.\nThe 747-400 was the next-generation Boeing 747 introduced in 1989. It is the best-selling variant of the Boeing 747. It includes improvements over the 747-300 including new engines, and new winglets, which improve fuel efficiency. Its length is the same as the 747-300 but the wingspan has been increased to 211 feet 5 inches. The 747-400 retains the same longer upper deck as the 747-300 (excluding frieghter versions), and came in six variants: the 747\u2013400, 747-400F, 747-400M, 747-400D, 747-400ER, and the 747-400ERF.\n747-8.\nThe most recent variant of the Boeing 747 was announced in 2005 and released on 2011. It includes a longer stretched upper deck, a new Boeing Sky Interior, an updated flight deck, new wings based on ones from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and new GEnx turbofan engines. It totals 250 feet in length, making it the longest commercial passenger jet ever built. The 747-8 comes in two variants: 747-8I and 747-8F (freighter)."}

It may happen that the pebbles later get cemented into another rock, such as a puddingstone. In this way, they make up a sedimentary rock for the second time.\nTechnical description.\nFlint is a cryptocrystalline (means you can't see the crystals) form of the mineral quartz. It is a variety of chert. It occurs as a line of knobbly masses in chalk and some limestones. Inside the nodule, flint is usually translucent, and can be various colours. A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour, typically white and rough in texture.\nUses.\nFlintstones often have a rough lumpy surface but when they are broken, they look like dark glass. It has been one of the most useful types of stone to humankind.\nFlint was used by hominins for over three million years. Stone tools found at Lake Turkana in Kenya, are dated as 3.3 million years old. This predates the genus \"Homo\" by half a million years. The oldest known \"Homo\" fossil is 2.8 million years old compared to the 3.3 million year old stone tools.\nWhen flintstones are broken, they have a sharp edge which could be used as a knife, or a scraper. When flint and an iron-containing material such as pyrite or steel are hit together, they can make a spark. For many centuries, flint was one of the main ways for people in many countries to make fire. People would carry a little box called a \"tinder box\" which had some tinder along with flint and pyrite or steel. The tinder was used to catch the spark and start a fire. Tinder could be sawdust, cloth, grass or bark. Flints were later used to make a spark to fire a gun. A gun that used flint was called a \"flintlock\" gun.\nFlintstones are used in some countries for building. In England the flintstones used for building were often \"knapped\" which means they were broken to show the inside, like the stones used for the tower of Long Melford Church (below). This gave a better finish to the building that the dull knobbly stones would have made."}

There is a huge sculpture being carved of him in South Dakota, United States. \nWhen Crazy Horse was first born he was given the name 'Curly'. When he was young, he had a vision when he was not supposed to and his family did not know where he was. His father found him and was very unhappy at what young Curly had done.\nAs Crazy Horse grew into a man, he was given his father's name Crazy Horse. His father then changed his own name to Worm. \nCrazy Horse had good medicine, so he was never killed when he went into battle. He led his people to the Little Bighorn river in northern Montana to join forces with other Sioux bands like the Hunkpapa and Miniconjou, and with other tribes like the Cheyennes and Arapahos. There they fought General George Armstrong Custer, killing and defeating him and his many horsemen.\nEventually Crazy Horse made a tough decision to lead his people, the Oglalas, to a reservation because they were starving. Game was scarce and the bison (buffalo) were nearly gone. He had no choice but to leave the Black Hills. When he arrived at Fort Robinson, he was forced to give up his weapons and horses. This made him very unhappy. One day, even though he was granted time to go on a hunt, he was lied to and, trying to get away, he was stabbed in his liver and died later that night, thus ending the Great Sioux War.\n\"Once I moved about like the wind. Now I surrender to you and that is all\"\nQuote by Geronimo, Chief of the Apaches .\nThe Sioux Royal Family, the House of Thasunke Witko, are descendants of Crazy Horse. A queen, Queen Wakiyan, was elected Queen of the Kingdom of Lakota (in Sioux, \"Oglala Oyanke\") and of the Oglala Sioux, and tried to improve the economy at the Pine Ridge Reservation with creativity and imagination, and to bring the Sioux forward into modern times;however, a conspiracy of jealous chieftains who were both male chauvinists opposed to having a female leader and also a corrupt group of men jealous of their own power and who prefer to preside over the poverty of the Sioux People, ruthlessly trumped up false allegations in order to depose this good queen.\nAccording to Frederick Hoxie's 'Encyclopedia of North American Indians' Crazy Horse was the third in his male line of descent to bear the name of Crazy Horse, which in Oglala is Tasunke Witko. Tasunke Witko III was the son of Rattling Blanket Woman and Tasunke Witko II. He married three times: 1st to Black Buffalo Woman, 2nd to Black Shawl, and 3rd to Nellie Larrabee (Laravie). Only his second wife, Black Shawl, bore him any children: a daughter named They Are Afraid of Her, who died aged three."}

The most common type of trumpet is a B\u266d trumpet, meaning that if the player plays a C, it will sound like a B\u266d in concert pitch. The trumpet is played by blowing into the mouthpiece and making a \"buzzing\" sound. There are three keys called valves that the player can press to change the pitch.\nHistory.\nThe trumpet has been around for about 3000 years. An early example of a brass instrument like a trumpet is called a shofar, which is still used in religious ceremonies. Eventually people started making trumpet-like instruments with wood (for example, the cornetto), and later, with brass. Modern bugles are similar to early metal trumpets.\nMany years ago, when the use of instrumental music was growing, trumpets became very important. Trumpets were long and without valves. This meant a player had to control the pitch of the sound with only his mouth, which was very difficult. Everyone respected trumpet players because trumpets were just so difficult to play.\nThe chromatic trumpet was developed in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, good valves made it easier to play notes on the trumpet. Still, trumpet is a difficult instrument to master.\nMusic for trumpet.\nClassical music is written for solo trumpet, and trumpets are included in orchestras. Trumpets play an important part in Jazz music, and other various popular genres. Sometimes, they also play short parts to emphasize sections in rock songs.\nTrumpet players.\nSome famous classical trumpet players are Adolph Herseth, Sergei Nakariakov and Maurice Andre.\nSome famous jazz trumpet players are Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Arturo Sandoval, Wynton Marsalis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Maynard Ferguson."}

They are broadly defined as having a wavelength between 1 millimeter and 1 meter, or narrowly between 3 mm and 300 mm. Microwaves have many uses including radar, radio astronomy, and to heat food in a microwave oven. Unlike longer radio waves, they do not bend around land obstacles but go in line of sight. Still, they are much used for communication because they can have a high bandwidth. Almost all spacecraft communicate by microwave radio.\nWhen something moves, it almost always has a wave pattern to its movement - this can be seen in water most easily, in ripples and ocean waves. A very common type of wave in the universe is electromagnetic waves. Light is an example of an electromagnetic wave, and so is a microwave, for example the cosmic microwave background radiation. We can only see electromagnetic radiation in the visible light spectrum (which is why it's called the visible light spectrum), so microwaves are invisible.\nMicrowaves were among the first radio waves discovered, in the late 19th century, by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz.\nMicrowave Ovens.\nMicrowave ovens work because microwaves make polar molecules (molecules that act like tiny magnets) all face the same direction - to visualize it, imagine that the microwave oven is telling all of the molecules to face left, then right. Heat is just the movement of molecules, so when the molecules do a great amount of moving, they are hot. \nLike other heat sources, microwave radiation can cause burns. They can go through skin and muscles. If vital organs are burned, the burns can kill. This is why a microwave oven does not work with the door open. "}
{"id": "24198", "revid": "1025711", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24198", "title": "Microwave oven", "text": "A microwave oven (commonly called a microwave) is a machine that cooks food using microwaves, a type of radio wave. The idea was invented when a scientist who was experimenting with radio waves saw his chocolate bar, which was in his pocket, had melted. He then knew that radio waves could cook food and invented the microwave oven. \nHistory.\nIn 1945, the heating effect of a high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Hired by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a chocolate bar he had in his pocket. First, Spencer deliberately cooked popcorn with a microwave oven. And the second time, he cooked an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters.\nTo prove his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.\nHow it works.\nThe microwave oven uses a magnetron, which is a type of vacuum tube. This is similar to a radio transmitter. It makes very short radio waves which go into the food to a depth of about 2.5cm (one inch). This makes water molecules twist about 2.5 billion times a second. This heats up the molecules around it. As they heat up the heat goes to the inside of the food. This process is called conduction. This also happens in a normal oven, but microwave energy goes deeper so that the food cooks much faster. In an ordinary oven the energy stays mostly near the surface, so it takes more time.\nApart from this, the oven has a wave guide, turntable, and a timer switch. When we place the food inside the chamber and turn the timer switch on, it sends a command to the magnetron to send microwaves, as well as to the turn table to start turning. The microwaves of microwave ovens can heat foods containing polar molecules, such as water, as polar molecules are prone to the vibration effect caused by the microwaves. To heat the food evenly the microwave's turntable spins the food around. \nMetals tend to spark in microwaves, rather than heating. The reason why is that metals like to give away electrons, so when the microwaves \"push\" at their magnet-like electrons, instead of turning, they just give the electrons away. A bunch of electrons running off of metal is called electricity, and we see it in the form of sparks."}

It has an atomic number of 28 and an atomic mass of about 58.69amu. It has 28 protons. It is a transition metal. \nProperties.\nPhysical properties.\nNickel is a silver-white metal. It is easily polished (made shiny). It is magnetic. It is not magnetic when heated above . It is not soft like many other metals. It can be stretched into wires easily. It is not radioactive.\nChemical properties.\nNickel is not a reactive metal. It dissolves slowly in acids. It does not rust like iron. It makes a thin coating of nickel(II) oxide which stops more corrosion. Aluminium does a similar thing. \nChemical compounds.\nNickel is found in two oxidation states: +2, nickel(II); and +3, nickel(III). Nickel(II) is more common. Nickel in its +2 oxidation state is green. Nickel(II) chloride is a common +2 oxidation state compound. Nickel(II) oxide is normally dark green, but sometimes it is gray. This is because some of the nickel is in the +3 oxidation state (nickel(III). Nickel(III) compounds are oxidizing agents. They also are grayish. Nickel compounds can be green, blue, gray, or black.\nNickel(II) compounds are not highly reactive. They are normally green or blue. They are toxic and irritate skin. Some of them are carcinogens.\nNickel(III) compounds are black or gray.\nIsotopes.\nThe isotopes of nickel range in atomic weight from 48Ni to 78Ni. Nickel that is found in nature is made up of five stable isotopes; 58Ni, 60Ni, 61Ni, 62Ni and 64Ni.\nAt least 26 radioisotopes of nickel have been found. The most stable radioisotope is 59Ni which has a half-life of 76,000 years. Nickel also has one meta state.\nHistory.\nNickel was found when an ore that looked like copper did not make copper metal. Later it was found that the ore actually had a new metal, called nickel. Nickel was isolated as a metal and classified as a chemical element by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt in 1751. At first, the copper colored nickel ore was the only source. Later, it was made as a byproduct of cobalt blue making.\nOccurrence.\nNickel is normally found in minerals, and not as a metal in the ground. Sometimes meteorites have nickel and iron metal in them. The most common nickel mineral is pentlandite. Most of the nickel on Earth is thought to be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. There are sulfidic and lateritic nickel ores. Philippines mines the most nickel. Other major mining countries are Russia, Canada and Australia. \nPreparation.\nNickel is found in both laterite and sulfide ores. They are heated to melt them and concentrate them. They are also separated by oils. Nickel is made from its sulfide by heating it in air. This oxidizes the sulfide to sulfur dioxide, leaving liquid nickel behind. This nickel is not yet pure and not ready for use. \nPure nickel with a nickel content greater than 99% is made in an electrolytic process. In this process, the nickel is dissolved in bath of sulfuric acid. When the pure nickel sticks to cathodes hanging into the bath, the impurities remain in the sulfuric acid or at the bottom of the bath. These impurities are very interesting, as they can contain precious metals. \nUses.\nSixty-eight percent of all nickel produced is used to make stainless steel. Nickel is also used in nichrome, a name for a nickel-chromium alloy, and other alloys. Nickel is used in magnets. Nickel is used in special expensive alloys called superalloys.\nNickel sulphate is used in rechargeable batteries. A lithium ion battery contains up to 15% of nickel while the lithium content is less than 1%. A nickel cadmium battery also uses nickel. Nickel compounds are also used to electroplate nickel on items. Nickel and some of its compounds are also used as a catalyst. Nickel is used in stainless steel. It is also used in some nonferrous alloys. It is used in electroplating.\nNickel is used to make many products like stainless steel, alnico magnet, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules and plating on plumbing fixtures. It is used as a green tint in glass.\nNickel foam is used in gas diffusion electrodes for alkaline fuel cells.\nNickel and its alloys are used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten carbide.\n63Ni is used in krytron devices as a beta particle emitter to make ionization by the keep-alive electrode more reliable. Raney nickel is used for hydrogenation of unsaturated oils to make margarine.\nConcentrations in Surface Sea water.\nNickel concentrations vary over the surface layer of the worlds\u2019 oceans. Nickel concentrations correlate with nutrient concentrations because it can be up taken by photosynthesizing organisms, such as diatoms. Nickel is then remineralized at depth from biogenic material. However, there is regional variability. In general, dissolved Nickel concentrations are rarely below 1.5-2.0 nmol/kg of seawater, usually in nutrient-deplete areas since it follows a similar profile. For example, there are generally lower concentrations in the northern hemisphere of the Atlantic Ocean, with the lowest Nickel concentration being 1.7 nanomol (nmol)/ kg of seawater. This could be related to greater Nickel uptake by nitrogen fixers and a high influence of aeolian iron concentrations. Photosynthesizing organisms\u2019 uptake the Nickel with an uptake in iron because iron stimulates nutrient in photosynthesizing organisms. Furthermore, in nutrient-rich eastern boundary currents, Nickel concentrations average 3.5 nmol/kg of seawater. North Atlantic surface waters (Equator to 40\u2070) from 0-100 meters range from 2.06 to 2.52 nmol/kg of seawater. In the North Atlantic, Nickel concentrations increase in concentration with depth from 0-500m range at 3.13 to 3.61 nmol/kg of sea water.\nIn the Southern Ocean, Nickel concentrations from 0-500m range from 5.67 nmol/kg of seawater to 6.51 nmol/kg of seawater. Southern oceans tend to have greater concentrations mainly due to the absence of a thermocline, which encourages intense mixing through storms and internal wave action. In the northeast Pacific Ocean from 0-500m, Nickel concentrations range from 5.54 nmol/kg of seawater to 6.63 nmol/kg of seawater, as there is a region of productivity there. In the non-upwelling, open-ocean of the North Pacific, concentrations of Nickel are between 1.0 and 2.0 (nmol) per kilogram of seawater (kg). Meanwhile, in equatorial upwelling surface zones of the Eastern Pacific, concentrations of Nickel average 3.0 nmol/kg of seawater. Upwelling brings nutrients to the surface waters, including various Nickel ion species. \nSafety.\nNickel can irritate skin. That is why jewelry that releases nickel ions is bad for some people. Some nickel salts are carcinogens. Nickel is not as toxic as other metals such as mercury but it is still toxic."}

It borders the largest city in Canada, Toronto. In fact, it is a part of the Greater Toronto Area. Toronto Pearson International Airport is located in Mississauga.\nHistory.\nOn August 2, 1805, Toronto Township was formed when officials from York (what is now the City of Toronto) purchased 84,000\u00a0acres (340\u00a0km\u00b2) of land from the Mississaugas. In January 2010, the Mississaugas and the federal government settled a land claim. The aboriginal people received $145,000,000 from that.\nAfter the land was surveyed, much of it was given in the form of land grants to United Empire Loyalists. They emigrated from the Thirteen Colonies during and after the American Revolution, as well as loyalists from New Brunswick. A group of settlers from New York City arrived in the 1830s. In 1820, the government purchased additional land from the Mississaugas. Additional settlements were established, including: Barbertown, Britannia, Burnhamthorpe, Derry West, Elmbank, Malton, Meadowvale Village, Mount Charles, and Streetsville. European-Canadian growth led to the eventual displacement of the Mississaugas. In 1847, the government relocated them to a reserve in the Grand River Valley, near present-day Hagersville.\nIn 1873, the Toronto Township Council was formed to oversee the events of the various villages that were unincorporated at that time. The Council's responsibilities included road maintenance, and a police force. Most of present-day Mississauga was agricultural land: including fruit orchards, through much of the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Exceptions included small villages, some gristmills and brickworks served by railway lines, \nIn the 1920s, cottages were constructed along the shores of Lake Ontario for people who lived in the city. 17 years later in 1937, 1,410.8\u00a0acres of land was sold to build the Malton Airport (later known as the Pearson Airport). It became Canada's busiest airport which also put the end to the community of Elmank.\nThe township settlements of Lakeview, Cooksville, Lorne Park, Clarkson, Erindale, Sheridan, Dixie, Meadowvale Village, and Malton were combined in 1968 to form the Town of Mississauga. At the time, both Port Credit and Streetsville were left out and remained separate. The town name was chosen by voting. In 1974, Port Credit and Streetsville became part of Mississauga. In that same year, the Square One Shopping Centre opened.\nOn November 10, 1979, a freight train left its tracks on the Canadian Pacific rail line while carrying explosive and poisonous chemicals just north of the intersection of Mavis Road and Dundas Street. One of the tank cars carrying propane exploded. Since other tank cars were carrying chlorine, the decision was made to evacuate nearby residents. With the possibility of a deadly cloud of chlorine gas spreading through Mississauga, 218,000 people were evacuated. Residents were allowed to return home, once the area was safe. It was one of the largest evacuations in North American history.\nGeography.\nMississauga covers of land, with of shoreline on Lake Ontario.\nStatistics.\nMississauga is a quickly growing and multicultural city. Statistics Canada estimates that Mississauga now has 704,000 people, an increase of 150,000 from the previous decade and the population has almost doubled in the past twenty years.\nLaw and Government.\nThe city of Mississauga has only had four mayors in its past and it was created in 1974. This is because in Mississauga usually mayors serve for a very long time. For example, Hazel McCallion, 99, has been mayor from 1978. The current mayor is who assumed office in the December of 2014.\nMississauga is split into 11 wards (parts) each of them having their own councillor.\nAlso, Mississauga is the largest city in Canada where there are more women in the council than men. \nMississauga has six legislative (government) ridings that are the same for the Canadian government and the Ontario government. The Canadian government has people in charge of those ridings called M.P.'s (Member of Parliament) and the Ontario government has M.P.P.'s (Member of Provincial Parliament) in charge of them."}

The word \"coyote\" comes from the N\u00e1huatl (Aztec) word c\u00f3yotl.\nAppearance.\nCoyotes are smaller than wolves. The color of the coyote's fur is a grayish brown to yellowish gray on the upper parts, while the throat and underside are a more white color. The forelegs, sides of the head, muzzle and feet are reddish brown. The ears of the coyote are long and pointed.\nHabitat.\nCoyotes are very adaptable and can live in almost all habitats live only in North America and some areas of Central America. They live in prairies, but also in cities swamps Chaparrals grasslands forest and mountains. The coyote is found throughout North America from California up to as far as Alaska. They normally live in dens about 6 feet wide and four feet tall.\nLife.\nThe coyote is an omnivore and eats fruits, grasses, vegetables, rabbits, mice, shrews and voles. They also eat insects, worms, rats, fish, birds, deer, snakes, and lizards. In the city, coyotes find food easily. They dig up plants in gardens and eat food out of garbage cans.\nSometimes, they join small packs (groups), but normally hunt alone. Coyotes live in dens. They dig a tunnel under the ground and then dig out a larger area at the end of the tunnel where they sleep and have their babies or pups. They can have six pups at a time. Often a coyote den will have two entrances, with one that is hidden. Sometimes they dig more than one den, so they can move if an enemy finds the den.\nCoyotes have a few enemies. Wolves, bears and cougars are the only enemies to coyotes, but there are not many wolves left in North America compared to the number of coyotes. The biggest enemy of the coyote is people. They do not usually attack people, but sometimes eat small pets such as cats.\nMythology.\nThe coyote is a character of many myths from Native American peoples. The coyote is often portrayed as a joker, and stories are told to explain things he does. The Pima regard him as the offspring of the moon. Coyote is always male with an overwhelming reference to his large penis which requires a pack to carry it in. He is a lustful creature with desire for Changing Bear Maiden and by attempting to have sex with women by becoming a baby. Coyote also has incestuous relations with his mother-in-law and daughter. He is credited for removing the teeth of \"vagina dentata\" or by moving the genitals to the correct location on the body in order to make sex pleasurable. Coyote has an appetite for menstrual blood and relates to Lakota girls' puberty rite.\nCoyote is often responsible for the finality of death and introduces work and suffering. The Apache believe he created Europeans. The Zuni believe he created pubic hair. The Pomo say he stole the sun and made the world dark. \nCoyote is curious and goes along with the crowd. He is a trickster, culture hero, and a feared shape-shifter. "}

It is a rodent from a subfamily called the Arvicolinae. They live in woodlands and grasslands.\nThere are about 155 species of voles. There are species in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The closest relatives of voles are the lemmings and muskrats, which are in the same subfamily.\nAdult voles, depending on the species, are 7.5 to 17.5 centimetres (three to seven inches) long. They eat seeds, grass or other plants, and insects.\nMany animals hunt voles, for example owls, hawks, coyotes, foxes, weasels, cats and snakes.\nThe average life of the smaller vole species is three to six months. These voles rarely live longer than 12 months. Larger species, such as the European water vole \"Arvicola\", live longer. They usually die during their second winter. As many as 88% of voles die during the first month of life."}

It was found by Christiaan Huygens on 25 March 1655. Titan is a unique moon because it is the solar system\u2019s only moon to have an atmosphere.\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest in the Solar System. Titan is larger than the planet Mercury. Its equatorial diameter (wideness at the equator) is 5,150\u00a0km. It orbits 1,221,865\u00a0km away from Saturn. \nTitan is the only moon known to have an atmosphere and it more thicker than Earth\u2019s. But humans could not breathe it as it is very cold, and also poisonous. The air is made of nitrogen and methane. Titan is the only place in the Solar System, except Earth, that has lakes and much liquid on its surface. But the liquid is methane, not water.\nDiscovery.\nTitan was discovered on 25 March 1655 by Christiaan Huygens, an astronomer from the Netherlands. Earlier, in 1610, Galileo Galilei had discovered four of Jupiter's moons. This inspired Huygens: he also wanted to discover new moons. Because Huygens had also improved the telescopes of the time, making them a lot better, he thought he might be able to discover a new moon.\nChristiaan and his brother, Constantijn, started to build their own telescopes in 1650. Using the first telescope he ever built, Christiaan Huygens was able to see Titan. At first he called it \"Luna Saturni\", which means \"Saturn's moon\" (he did not know there was more than one). Through the years, lots of other moons have been discovered and today the moon is known as \"Titan\" or as \"Saturn VI\". The name \"Titan\", and all the names of Saturn's other moons, are from the Greek legends.\nStructure.\nTitan is the only moon in the Solar System that has a thick atmosphere (the gases that surround a planet or moon). After the spacecraft Voyager I visited the moon on 12 November 1979, it showed that Titan's surface (the ground level) is hidden under an atmosphere that is 900\u00a0km thick. Before this, everyone thought that Titan was the biggest moon in the Solar System. Now we know that it is the second biggest, after Ganymede, one of Jupiter's moons.\nEven though it is smaller, Titan is close in size to Ganymede. It is also close in size to the slightly smaller Callisto, another of Jupiter's moons. Not only is Titan a big moon, it is even bigger than the planet Mercury, but it only has half as much mass (it is much lighter). Because Titan does not have a lot of mass, scientist think that Titan is made of matter that is not very heavy, specifically frozen water and ammonia. Some scientists think that there is a lot of liquid water and ammonia underneath the surface, enough to fill an entire ocean. These scientists think that there might be a form of life inside this ocean.\nAt its centre, Titan has a rocky core that is about 3400\u00a0km thick. This core is made up of silicates and metals. The gravity (the force that keeps everything attached to the ground) is a lot weaker than here on earth. If you could jump 1m high on the Earth, you would be able to jump 7m high on Titan.\nMovement.\nIt takes Titan 15 days and 22 hours to orbit (travel) around Saturn. This is almost the same time it takes Saturn to rotate or spin around its own axis - one full spin. This is known as \"synchronous rotation\", which means that the same side of Titan is always pointed to Saturn.\nThe path in which Titan moves, its orbit, is very close to a circle, but not quite. We use the word \"eccentricity\" to describe the path that a moon or planet travels in. An image with an eccentricity of 0 (zero) has a path that is a perfect circle. If the eccentricity is more than 0, the path is less round (see image below). Titan's eccentricity is 0.028, very close to zero.\nCassini-Huygens mission.\nOn July 1, 2004, the Cassini-Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe and started to move towards Titan. It landed on Titan's surface on January 14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it confirmed that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini probe continued to gain data of Titan and a number of the icy moons. It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its geysers. Cassini also proved in July, 2006 that Titan contained hydrocarbon lakes, located near its north pole. In March, 2007, it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the Caspian Sea near its north pole. The lake of liquid methane has been named Kraken Mare. In 2009, Nasa showed a photograph showing the sunlight reflecting off the surface of the lake. This was the first ever picture of liquid on another world.\nIn 2012 researchers at NASA discovered that Titan is giving off a faint glow of light. This is believed to be caused by complex chemical reactions occurring in Titan's atmosphere. This kind of light is called an airglow."}

It began as a Phoenician colony. Carthage at the height of its power was the foremost power in the Mediterranean Sea, controlling parts of Spain, Sicily, North Africa, Sardinia, and the Balearic islands. \nThe Roman Republic destroyed Carthage in the Punic Wars of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. In later centuries Rome started a colony in the same place and it became an important city of Africa Province. Eventually the Vandals conquered the city and used it to attack Rome. \nThe Punic Wars.\nCarthage was a rival for Mediterranean Sea power for the Roman Republic, who wanted to take over the whole western Mediterranean Sea. Carthage was a large obstacle to that. So, in 264 BC, the Romans responded to a plea for help by some rebels in Messina, and landed an army in Sicily. This started the First Punic War. The Romans then invaded the Carthaginian holdings in Sicily, and the Carthaginian generals could not stop them. Even at sea, the Romans were able to copy the Carthaginian bireme ships and win several major victories on the sea, though the Carthaginians had long fought at sea and the Romans were new to this. \nFinally, a general named Hamilcar Barca took up the Carthaginian defense in place of the decidedly older, less energetic Hanno. Hamilcar immediately realized the futility of meeting the superior Roman army in open battle, so he decided to use hit-and-run raids to wear down the Romans. This tactic was slightly more effective against the slow, heavily armored roman troops. Eventually, however the Romans were able to take Lilybaeum, the Carthaginian's main stronghold in Sicily. This ended Carthage's power in Sicily and ended the First Punic War. \nIn the Second Punic War, Hannibal Barca led the Carthaginian army through Spain, southern Gaul, and across the Alps, into Italy in 218 BC. There he clashed with the Roman Republic in 3 major battles: the battle of the River Trebia, the battle of lake Trasmine, and The battle of Cannae. Hannibal defeated the Romans in stunning victories in each of these battles. He failed, however, to take Rome, and eventually had to retreat back to Carthage, where he was defeated by Scipio Africanis in the battle of Zama. The Romans destroyed Carthage in 146 BC, in the third Punic war. The Carthaginians who survived, numbering about 50,000, were sold into slavery."}

(\"2014 estimate\"), is the capital of the Kingdom of Morocco. It is also the capital of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra region.\nThe city is on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg. On the other side of the river is Rabat's bedroom community. Together the two cities with Temara have a population of 1.8 million. Silting problems have lowered the city's role as a port. However, Rabat and Sal\u00e9 still maintain somewhat important textile, food processing and construction industries. Some are from sweatshop labor by major businesses.\nIn addition, tourism and being home to all foreign embassies in Morocco help to make Rabat the second most important city in the country after the larger and economically more significant Casablanca.\nHistory.\nBC to 17th century.\nRabat's history began with a settlement, known as Chellah on the banks of the Oued Bou Regreg in the third century BC. In 40 AD, Romans took over Chellah and changed it to the Roman settlement of Sala Colonia. Rome held the colony until 250 AD. They gave it up to local rulers. In 1146, the berber Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min turned Rabat's ribat into a full scale fortress. It was used as a starting point for attacks on Spain. In 1170, due to its military importance, Rabat acquired the title \"Ribatu l-Fath\", meaning \"stronghold of victory,\" from which it gets its current name.\nYaqub al-Mansur (known as Moulay Yacoub in Morocco), another Almohad Caliph, moved the capital of his empire to Rabat. He built Rabat's city walls, the Kasbah of the Udayas and began construction on what would have been the world's largest mosque. However, Yaqub died and construction stopped. The ruins of the unfinished mosque, along with the Hassan Tower, still stand today.\nYaqub's death a period of decline at first. The Almohad empire lost control of its land in Spain and much of its African territory. Eventually this led to its total collapse. In the 13th century, much of Rabat's economic power shifted to Fez. In 1515 a Moorish explorer, El Wassan, reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 houses remained with people living in them. An increase of Moriscos, who had been removed from Spain, in the early 17th century helped boost Rabat's growth.\nCorsair republics.\nRabat and neighboring Sal\u00e9 united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627. The republic was run by Barbary pirates who used the two cities as base ports for starting attacks on shipping. The pirates did not have to fight with any central authority until the Alaouite Dynasty united Morocco in 1666. They attempted to establish control over the pirates, but failed. European and Muslims authorities continued to attempt to control the pirates over many years. The Republic of Bou Regreg did not collapse until 1818. Even after the republic's collapse, pirates continued to use the port of Rabat. This led to the attack of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack.\n20th century.\nFrench invasion.\nThe French invaded Morocco in 1912 and established a protectorate. The French administrator of Morocco, General Hubert Lyautey, decided to move the country's capital from Fez to Rabat. Among other factors, citizens had made Fez an unstable place because of their desire to rebel. Sultan Moulay Youssef followed the decision of the French and moved his home to Rabat. In 1913, Gen. Lyautey hired Henri Prost who designed the Ville Nouvelle (Rabat's modern quarter) as an administrative sector. When Morocco became independent in 1956, Mohammed V, the then King of Morocco, chose to have the capital remain at Rabat.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter World War II, the United States created a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base. By the early 1950s, Rabat Sal\u00e9 Air Base was a U.S. Air Force based hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division. These divisions oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-47 Stratojet aircraft in the country. With the destabilization of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the U.S. Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco. He insisted on such action after Americans became involved in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959. They were fully out of Morocco by 1963. SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B-52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B-47s. It also had completed USAF bases in Spain in 1959.\nWith the USAF leaving Rabat-Sal\u00e9 in the 1960s, the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base N\u00ba 1, a status it continues to hold.\nCulture.\nThe biggest place for theatre is the Theatre Mohamed V in the centre of the town. The city also has a few official galleries and an archeological museum. Many organisations are active in cultural and social issues. Orient-Occident Foundation and ONA Foundation are the biggest of these. An independent art scene is active in the city. L'appartement 22, which is the first independent space for visual arts created by Abdellah Karroum, opened in 2002.\nRabat was selected as a filming location for the war film \"Black Hawk Down\" (2001).\nInternational relations.\n2020 Summer Olympics.\nRabat will bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.\nTwin towns - Sister cities.\nRabat is twinned with:\nClimate.\nRabat features a Mediterranean climate. Along the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat has a mild, temperate climate. It moves from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or colder in winter) Daytime temperatures generally always rise about +9/10 C\u00b0 (+15/18\u00a0F\u00b0) every day. The winter highs usually reach only in December-January (\"see weather-table below\")."}

It has a population of more than 79,000 people (100,000 if the people living in Kempston are included). It is formed of multiple districts, such as Putnoe, Goldington, Brickhill and Woodside. Many people also live in the smaller villages surrounding Bedford, such as Sandy, Willington, Cople and Cardington. It has many outstanding schools, both State and Public. It is one of only two places nationally that has a three-tier school system, although it is currently undergoing the transition to two-tier. There are academies, Bedford Free School, community and an SEN schools. It is also a place with a large diversity of nationalities, such as Italians and Polish, stemming from the Brick works that used to stand in ...\nHistory.\nThe town of Bedford is about 1000 years old. There was a castle there, but it was destroyed in 1224. A small hill with a tower now stands in the place of the castle. It overlooks the river Great Ouse which flows through the town. Every four years a River Festival is held there, with stalls, a fair and dragon boat races. Bedford was a market town from the early Middle Ages. It was given its borough charter in 1166 by Henry II.\nEducation.\nDuring the last century many people moved to Bedford because there were good schools there. There are four public schools which are governed by the Harpur Trust: Bedford Boys School, Bedford Girls School, Bedford Modern and Pilgrims Pre-Preparatory School. There are also some smaller private schools. \nBedford also has various local authority schools. Bedford Borough operates a three-tier education system in some of the area, arranged into lower, middle and upper schools, as recommended in the Plowden Report of 1967. Many students study at the University of Bedfordshire, which is based in Bedford and Luton. Bedford College offers further education. Also, Stella Mann College is a private college which offers a range of further education courses for the performing arts.\nHundreds of school children can take part in Bedfordshire Youth Music courses during the holidays, have music lessons in school and participate in the orchestra. There is also a Bedfordshire Youth Theatre that runs activities for all age groups.\nFeatures and events.\nThe town of Bedford has scenic routes to walk along the banks of the River Great Ouse. The banks of the river by the town centre are called The Embankment. There are nice gardens there and two bridges for pedestrians, one of which is called The Butterfly Bridge. The newer of these bridges is known as the \u201cButterfly Bridge\u201d because it is shaped like a butterfly.\nEvery two years, an event called Bedford River Festival is held near the river in Bedford during early July. The event lasts for two days. About 250,000 people go there to enjoy all the events, the sports, food, funfairs and live music.\nThe big church in the centre of the town is called St Paul\u2019s Church. It stands in St Paul\u2019s Square. It has a tall spire which can be seen from a long way away. There was a church there in 1066. The present church was started in the early 13th century and gradually more parts were added. The tower and spire were completely rebuilt in the 1860s. John Bunyan and John Wesley both preached in the church. There is a stained glass window dedicated to Sir William Harpur who gave his money to charity in the 16th century allowing almshouses and schools to be built in Bedford.\nThere are museums in Bedford. The Cecil Higgins Art Gallery is in the Victorian home of the Higgins family who used to be brewers. A modern building next to it has paintings, ceramics, glass and lace. The Bedford Museum is next door and has things from Bedford\u2019s history. Just round the corner is the John Bunyan museum showing things about Bedford\u2019s most famous writer.\nHospitals and services.\nBedford Hospital is split between two sites in the town. It serves people from the whole of Mid Bedford. Many discussions are still taking place about the future of the hospital and how it should be organized.\nThere are many shops in the town centre, as well as out-of-town shopping areas. The Aspects Leisure Centre has cinemas and other amusements. It is near the opposite end of the Embankment from the town centre.\nMusic and Drama.\nThere is a lot of opportunity to hear music in Bedford. Many local musicians play in the Bedfordshire Symphony Orchestra and the Bedford Sinfonia. They give their concerts in the Corn Exchange in St Paul\u2019s Square, where one can also hear concerts given by the famous professional Philharmonia Orchestra who give a series of concerts during the year. There are several amateur choirs including the large Bedford Choral Society and the chamber choirs Cantamus and Concord Singers. The Bedford Music Club organizes chamber concerts on Thursdays during the year, and there are many other musical events including lunch hour concerts at St Paul\u2019s Church. In August the 'Proms In The Park' takes place in Bedford Park. It is given by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and attracts thousands of people who take rugs and food and sit on the grass to listen to the music.\nAlthough Bedford has no large theatre there are many amateur groups such as the Bedford Dramatic Club, Swan Theatre Company, Bedford Marianettes who perform in several places such as the Bowen West Theatre and Civic Theatre. There are also several local bands.\nSport.\nAs Bedford has a river there is a lot of opportunity for rowing. Bedford has two rugby union teams called Bedford Blues and Bedford Athletic. Bedford Blues are now in the second tier of English rugby, although they have previously been in the top division. Bedford has an athletic stadium, home to many famous sports personalities and trains youth.\nTransport.\nBedford\u2019s main railway station is in Midland Road. Capital Connect run trains from Bedford to Brighton passing through London, and Midland Main Line have trains that go from London, passing through Bedford on their way to Leeds. There are also trains to Bletchley in Milton Keynes, and the Marston Vale Line which also stops at Bedford St Johns railway station.\nThere is a lot of traffic in Bedford as several roads spread out from the centre of the town in all directions. The M1 is 8 miles to the west, and the Al is about the same distance to the east. Bedford now has a by-pass between Milton Keynes and the Black Cat Round About near St. Neots. \nBuses from Bedford travel to Northampton, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Oxford and other towns in the region. Most of these services depart from the main bus station in the town. This bus station is currently undergoing renevation as part of a scheme to upgrade facilities in the town centre, including free car parking for two hours on Saturday.\nDemographics.\nThere are many Italian people living in Bedford. Many of them came from the 1950s onwards to work at the brickworks of the London Brick Company. There are many Italian bars and restaurants and social clubs as well as a church and a vice-consulate. Many of the people who came in the 1950s now have grandchildren growing up in Bedford, and many of them have married people from other cultures. More recently many people have immigrated from other parts of the world such as South Asia and Eastern Europe (particularly in the last few years), Greece, Cyprus, the Middle East and Africa. Many languages are spoken in Bedford including Italian, Punjabi, Turkish, Polish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese. There is a big, new Sikh temple in the district known as Queen\u2019s Park.\nTwinned towns.\nBedford is twinned with:\nRelationship with nearby towns and villages.\nThe town of Kempston has now grown to be part of Bedford. The villages in the Borough of Bedford with populations of more than 2,000 are Biddenham, Bromham, Clapham, Elstow, Oakley, Sharnbrook, Shortstown, Wilstead, and Wootton. There are also many smaller villages in the borough. The villages in the borough are popular with commuters to Bedford, and also with people who commute to Milton Keynes, which is a bigger employment centre than Bedford, and to London.\nFamous Bedfordians.\nThe most famous person from Bedford was John Bunyan, the author of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\". He was born in Harrowden, near Elstow which is just outside Bedford. Later he lived in St Cuthbert Street, which is the next street east parallel to the High Street, but was still just at the edge of Bedford at that time. Bunyan Meeting is a church on the site where Bunyan, at the end of his life, was allowed to have a barn to preach. It is joined to the Bunyan Museum. There is a statue of Bunyan on the corner of the High Street by Bedford School. \nOther famous Bedfordians include Sir William Harpur, the philanthropist, John Howard, the prison reformer, Charles Wells, founder of Charles Wells Brewery, a company which is still in the town, Ronnie Barker the comedian, Media Personality and former 'Countdown' Co-host Carol Vorderman and John Le Mesurier, actor and comedian. People who went to school in Bedford include the politician Paddy Ashdown, the cricketer Alastair Cook, the playwright Christopher Fry and the athlete Paula Radcliffe.Also cricketer Monty Panesar and comedian Al Murray."}

{"id": "24288", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24288", "title": "Ejaculation", "text": "Ejaculation is when a male person (or other male mammal) shoots out liquid from his erect penis after it has been aroused or stimulated (excited sexually). It happens when he has an orgasm. This article is about ejaculation in human beings.\nWhen a man is stimulated, his penis becomes erect. When he has an orgasm, semen comes out from the end of his penis. Semen contains sperm and other substances. How long a man can be stimulated before ejaculating, how long the ejaculation lasts, the strength of the ejaculation, and the amount of semen that comes out, all vary from one man to another. When a man ejaculates, he has a very good feeling in his penis and his groin area (the part of his body where his torso joins the top of his legs). A man can ejaculate after he masturbates, is touched by someone else sexually, and sometimes, even if he is not touched (for example, if he looks at pictures and videos on the internet that cause sexual arousal, or thinks about sex). Ejaculation can also happen without control when a man is sleeping, which is called a wet dream.\nUrine can sometimes also come out with the ejaculatory fluid during sex.\nBoys usually do not ejaculate until they reach puberty but sometimes it can happen before.\nSlang terms for ejaculation are \"blowing a load\" or \"blowing a wad\", and \"busting a nut\". \"creaming\", \"cumming\", \"jizzing\", \"jazzing\", \"spurting\", \"squirting\" and \"skeeting\". Ejaculation takes place when the man has an orgasm (the height of sexual excitement), usually after his genitals have been physically stimulated in some way. However, ejaculation can also happen if a man has not been touched, for instance if he becomes aroused or stimulated (made sexually excited) by looking at sexy pictures, watching sexy videos, or thinking about sex. When a man ejaculates while sleeping, it is called nocturnal emission.\nHow it happens.\nBefore a man can ejaculate, his penis needs to be stimulated. The penis is usually soft, quite short and hangs down. When a man is stimulated, for example by seeing another naked person, masturbating or being touched by someone else sexually, the inside of his penis fills with blood. This causes it to become longer, thicker, harder and to stand upright, and is called an erection. Men can be stimulated for different amounts of time before they ejaculate.\nEjaculation takes place in two stages.\nAfter a man has ejaculated, his penis usually becomes soft and shorter again. He may also have an enjoyable and relaxing feeling in his groin area. It takes some time before he can have another erection and ejaculation. This time is called the refractory period. The average refractory period is about half an hour. Younger men normally have a shorter refractory period than older men. Men who are 18 years old have a refractory period of about 15\u00a0minutes, while men in their 70s have one of about 20\u00a0hours. Some men's penises remain hard after one ejaculation, and they are able to have another ejaculation after some time without losing their erection. Most young and middle-aged men can probably have about two to three ejaculations in a few hours, but it has been said that some men are able to have up to nine ejaculations a day.\nWhen a man ejaculates before he wants to, this is called premature ejaculation. If a man cannot ejaculate after having been aroused for a long time, even though he wants to, this is called delayed ejaculation or anorgasmia. A man who is unable to ejaculate at all is said to have anejaculation. Some men are able to have an orgasm without ejaculating. This is called a dry orgasm.\nApart from giving a man pleasure, ejaculation may help a man stay healthy. A study carried out in Australia seemed to show that men who ejaculate often have less chance of getting prostate cancer.\nSemen.\nSemen is known informally as \"cum\", \"jism\" or \"jizz\". Men ejaculate different amounts of semen. Normally, an ejaculation makes between 1.5 and 5 millilitres (up to one teaspoonful) of semen. More semen tends to come out if a man has not ejaculated for many days, or if he has been stimulated for a long time. Older men produce less semen. If a man ejaculates an unusually small amount of semen, this is a medical condition called hypospermia.\nSemen is usually a white or yellowish fluid. It starts off being slightly thick and sticky, then after a while it becomes more watery. Semen contains many chemicals. These include citric acid, fructose (a type of sugar), enzymes that speed up chemical reactions in the body, lipids (substances that fat is made of), and slippery fluids that help the semen to move through the urethra.\nThe number of sperm in an ejaculation of semen depends on many things. There may be more sperm if:\nIf there are an unusually low number of sperm in an ejaculation, this is called oligospermia. If there are no sperm at all, this is called azoospermia. A man with oligospermia or azoospermia is usually infertile, and cannot or finds it very hard to make a woman pregnant by having sex with her.\nIf a man has a sexually transmitted infection or STI (an infection that is passed from one person to another by sex), the germs that cause the disease can appear in his semen. If the person that the man has sex with touches the semen, he or she can become infected by the germs and pick up the disease. AIDS, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, herpes and syphillis are examples of STIs. One of the ways for a man to lower the chance of passing on an STI to his sexual partner is to wear a condom on his penis when having sex.\nFertilization.\nWhen a man has sexual intercourse with a woman, he places his penis within her vagina and moves his penis back and forth, typically in a thrusting motion, while the woman moves her hips. The vagina is warm and somewhat moist, and it places pressure on the man's penis. These sensations, combined with the friction caused by the in-and-out movements, stimulates the penis, which causes the man to have an orgasm and to ejaculate. If the woman is using birth control this will usually not cause her to become pregnant. Otherwise, the sperm in the semen can travel into the woman's uterus and Fallopian tubes. If there happens to be an ovum or egg cell in a Fallopian tube, a sperm may fuse with the ovum. This is called fertilization, and makes the woman pregnant.\nHowever, before a man ejaculates, a clear, colourless, sticky fluid called pre-ejaculate (also known as pre-ejaculate fluid or informally as pre-cum) can come out of his penis. Pre-ejaculate is produced by the bulbourethral or Cowper's glands. Some tests have shown that pre-ejaculate does not contain any sperm. However, some sperm may have been left behind in the urethra from an earlier ejaculation and the pre-ejaculate may carry this sperm out of the penis. That is why a woman can become pregnant even if the man pulls his penis out of her vagina before he ejaculates. Also, if a man ejaculates near the woman's vagina and semen falls on her body, sperm can accidentally enter the vagina and cause a pregnancy. To avoid the woman becoming pregnant when she does not want to, the man and the woman can use methods of contraception or birth control. For example, the man can wear a condom on his penis, or the woman can take birth control pills.\nFirst ejaculation.\nYoung boys cannot ejaculate. A boy's first ejaculation usually happens about one year after he begins puberty, which is when his body starts changing into a man's body. Most boys go through puberty in their teens. The first time a boy ejaculates usually happens when he is asleep. This is called a nocturnal emission (which means \"an emission happening at night\") or a wet dream. It happens without the boy's control, often when he is having a dream about sex. Scientists believe that wet dreams are the body's way of removing too much semen. When a boy begins masturbating, wet dreams usually stop happening.\nWhen a boy starts to ejaculate, he usually produces only a small amount of semen. The semen is different from what an adult man produces. It is usually clear and stays sticky. It either has no sperm in it, or sperm that do not move properly or do not move at all. A boy's semen only becomes like an adult man's semen about two years after his first ejaculation."}

{"id": "24297", "revid": "1264", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24297", "title": "Human evolution", "text": "Human evolution is about the origin of human beings. All humans belong to the same species, which has spread from its birthplace in Africa to almost all parts of the world. Its origin in Africa is proved by the fossils which have been found there.\nThe term 'human' in this context means the genus \"Homo\". However, studies of human evolution usually include other hominids, such as the Australopithecines, from which the genus \"Homo\" had diverged (split) by about 2.3 to 2.4 million years ago in Africa. The first \"Homo sapiens\", the ancestors of today's humans, evolved around 200,000 years ago.\nIt was known for centuries that man and the apes were related. At heart, their anatomy is similar, despite many superficial differences. This was the reason why Buffon and Linnaeus, in the 18th century, put them together in one family. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution says that such basic structural similarity comes from the common origin of the group. The apes and man are close relatives, and are primates: the order of mammals which includes monkeys, apes, lemurs and tarsiers.\nThe great apes live in tropical rainforests. It is thought that human evolution started when a group of apes (now called the australopithecines) began to live more in the savannah. A savannah is more open, with trees, shrubs and grass. This group started walking on two legs. They began to use their hands to carry things. Life in the open was different, and there was a big advantage in having better brains. Their brains grew larger, and they began to make simple tools. This process began at least 5 million years ago. We have fossils of two or three different groups of walking apes, and one was the ancestor of humans.\nThe biological name for \"human\" or \"man\" is \"Homo\". The modern human species is called \"Homo sapiens\". \"Sapiens\" means \"thought\". \"Homo sapiens\" means \"the thinking man\".\nPaleoanthropology looks at ancient human fossils, tools, and other signs of early human life. It began in the 19th century with the discovery of a skull of \"Neanderthal man\" in 1856.\nHumans are similar to great apes.\nBy 1859, zoologists had known for a long time that humans are, in their anatomy, similar to the great apes. There are also differences: humans can speak, for example. But the similarities are more basic than the differences. Humans also have features with a much older history, from early in the life of vertebrates.\nThe idea that species are caused by evolution had been proposed before Darwin, but his book gave much evidence, and many were persuaded by it. The book was \"On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection\", published in November 1859. In this book, Darwin wrote about the idea of evolution in general, rather than the evolution of humans. \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history\", was all Darwin wrote on the subject. Nevertheless, the implication of the theory was clear to readers at the time.\nSeveral people discussed the evolution of humans. Among them were Thomas Huxley and Charles Lyell. Huxley convincingly showed many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes in his 1863 book \"Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature\". When Darwin published his own book on the subject, \"The Descent of Man, and selection in relation to sex\", the idea of human evolution was already well-known. The theory was controversial. Even some of Darwin's supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not like the idea that human beings have evolved their impressive mental capacities and moral sensibilities through natural selection.\nSince the 18th century, scientists thought the great apes to be closely related to human beings. In the 19th century, they speculated that the closest living relatives of humans were either chimpanzees or gorillas. Both live in central Africa in tropical rainforests. In fact, chimpanzees are closest to us. Biologists believed that humans share a \"common ancestor\" with other African great apes and that fossils of these ancestors would be found in Africa, which they have been. It is now accepted by virtually all biologists that humans are not only similar to the great apes, but actually are great apes.\nThe issue was confirmed by late 20th century studies on the sequences of proteins and genes in apes and man. These studies showed that man shares about 95 to 98% of these structures with chimpanzees. This is a much closer relationship than with any other type of animal, and fully supports the ideas put forward in the 19th century by Darwin and Huxley.\nDistinguishing features.\nPrimates have diversified in habitats such as trees and bushes. They have many features which are adaptations to their environment. Here are some of those traits:\nNot all primates have these anatomical traits, nor is every trait unique to primates. Primates are frequently highly social, live in groups with 'flexible dominance hierarchies'.\nOther similarities.\nClosely related animals almost always have closely related parasites. This usually comes about because parasites evolve with their hosts, and when host populations split, their parasites split also. It is also possible for parasites to get from one species to another. Two of the most serious parasitic infections of humans in Africa have originated in apes. Each may have been transferred to humans by a single cross-species event.\nThere are several species of mosquito, and several species of the malarial parasite \"Plasmodium\". The most serious type, \"P. falciparum\", which kills many millions of people each year, originated in gorillas. It is now virtually certain that chimpanzees are the source of HIV-1, the major cause of AIDS. This information is got by the sequence analysis of ape and human viruses.\nThe relevance of this to evolution is that our physiology is so close to the apes that their parasites were able to transfer to humans with great success. Humans have much less resistance to these parasites, which are ancient in origin, but comparatively new to our species.\nImmediate ancestors of the genus \"Homo\".\nIt was not until the 1920s that hominid fossils were discovered in Africa. In 1924, Raymond Dart described \"Australopithecus africanus\". The specimen was called the Taung Child, an australopithecine infant discovered in a cave deposit being mined for concrete at Taung, South Africa. The remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and a cast of the inside of the individual's skull. Although the brain was small (410\u00a0cm\u00b3), its shape was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the specimen had short canine teeth, and the position of the foramen magnum was evidence of bipedal locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung baby was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans.\nIt took another 20 years before Dart's claims were taken seriously. This was after other similar skeletons had been found. The most common view of the time was that a large brain evolved \"before\" bipedality, the ability to walk on two feet more or less upright. It was thought that intelligence similar to that of modern humans was necessary for bipedalism. This turned out to be wrong: bipedality came first.\nThe australopithecines are now thought to be immediate ancestors of the genus \"Homo\", the group to which modern humans belong. Both australopithecines and \"Homo sapiens\" are part of the tribe Hominini, but recent data has brought into doubt the position of \"A. africanus\" as a direct ancestor of modern humans; it may well have been a cousin. The australopithecines were originally classified as either gracile or robust. The robust variety of \"Australopithecus\" has since been reclassified as \"Paranthropus\", although it is still regarded as a subgenus of \"Australopithecus\" by some authors.\nIn the 1930s, when the robust specimens were first described, the \"Paranthropus\" genus was used. During the 1960s, the robust variety was moved into \"Australopithecus\". The recent trend has been back to the original classification as a separate genus.\nThe genus \"Homo\".\nIt was Carolus Linnaeus who chose the name \"Homo\". Today, there is only one species in the genus: \"Homo sapiens\". There were other species, but they became extinct.\nThe figure shows where some of them lived and at what time. Some of the other species might have been ancestors of \"H. sapiens\". Many were likely our \"cousins\", they developed away from our ancestral line.\nAnthropologists are still investigating the exact line of descent. A consensus on which should count as separate species and which as subspecies has not been reached yet. In some cases this is because there are very few fossils, in other cases it is due to the slight differences used to classify species in the \"Homo\" genus.\nThe evolution of the genus \"Homo\" took place mostly in the Pleistocene. The whole genus is characterised by its use of stone tools, initially crude, and becoming ever more sophisticated. So much so that in archaeology and anthropology the Pleistocene is usually referred to as the Palaeolithic, or the Stone Age.\n\"Homo habilis\".\n\"Homo habilils\" was likely the first species of Homo. It developed from the Australopithecus, about 2.5 million years ago. It lived until about 1.4 million years ago. It had smaller molars (back teeth) and larger brains than the Australopithecines.\nTowards \"Homo erectus\".\nThere are two proposed species that lived from 1.9 to 1.6 million years ago. Their relation has not been clarified. One of them is called \"Homo rudolfensis\". It is known from a single incomplete skull from Kenya. Scientists have suggested that this was just another habilis, but this has not been confirmed. The other is currently called \"Homo georgicus\". It is from Georgia and may be an intermediate form between \"H. habilis\" and \"H. erectus\", or a sub-species of \"H. erectus\".\n\"Homo ergaster\" and \"Homo erectus\".\n\"Homo erectus\" was first discovered on the island of Java in Indonesia, in 1891. The discoverer, Eugene Dubois originally called it \"Pithecanthropus erectus\" based on its morphology that he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes. Homo erectus lived from about 1.8 million to 70,000 years ago. The earlier specimens (from 1.8 to 1.2 million years ago) are sometimes seen as a different species, or a subspecies. called \"Homo ergaster\", or \"Homo erectus ergaster'.\nIn the early Pleistocene, 1.5\u20131 mya, in Africa, Asia, and Europe, presumably, some populations of \"Homo habilis\" evolved larger brains and made more elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species, \"H. erectus\". In addition \"H. erectus\" was the first human ancestor to walk truly upright. This was made possible by the evolution of locking knees and a different location of the foramen magnum (the hole in the skull where the spine enters). They may have used fire to cook their meat.\nA famous example of \"Homo erectus\" is Peking Man; others were found in Asia (notably in Indonesia), Africa, and Europe. Many paleoanthropologists are now using the term \"Homo ergaster\" for the non-Asian forms of this group. They reserve \"H. erectus\" only for those fossils found in the Asian region that meet certain requirements (as to skeleton and skull) which differ slightly from ergaster.\nNeanderthal man.\n\"Homo neaderthalensis\" (usually called Neanderthal man) lived from about 250,000 to about 30,000 years ago. Also, less usual, as \"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis\": there is still some discussion if it was a separate species \"Homo neanderthalensis\", or a subspecies of \"H. sapiens\". While the debate remains unsettled, evidence from mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal DNA sequencing indicates that little or no gene flow occurred between \"H. neanderthalensis\" and \"H. sapiens\", and, therefore, the two were separate species. In 1997, Dr. Mark Stoneking, then an associate professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University, stated: \nMore investigation of a second source of Neanderthal DNA supported these findings.\nDenisovan man.\nA genetic analysis of a piece of finger bone found in Siberia has produced a surprise result. It dates to about 40,000 years ago, at a time when Neanderthals and modern man were living in the area. German researchers found its mitochondrial DNA did not match either that of our species or that of Neanderthals. If this result is correct, the bone belongs to a previously unknown species. The degree of difference in the DNA suggests this species split off from our family tree about a million years ago, well before the split between our species and Neanderthals.\n\"Homo floresiensis\".\n\"Homo floresiensis\", which lived about 100,000\u201312,000 years ago has been nicknamed \"hobbit\" for its small size. Its size may be a result of island dwarfism, the tendency for large mammals to evolve smaller forms on islands. \"H. floresiensis\" is intriguing both for its size and its age. It is a concrete example of a recent species of the genus \"Homo\" that shows derived traits not shared with modern humans. In other words, \"H. floresiensis\" share a common ancestor with modern humans, but split from the modern human lineage and followed a different evolutionary path. The main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age. Found in 2003 it has been dated to approximately 18,000 years old. The living woman was estimated to be one meter in height, with a brain volume of just 380\u00a0cm3 This is small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the \"H. sapiens\" average of 1400\u00a0cm3.\nThere is an ongoing debate over whether \"H. floresiensis\" is indeed a separate species. Some scientists believe that \"H. floresiensis\" was a modern \"H. sapiens\" suffering from pathological dwarfism. Modern humans who live on Flores, the island where the skeleton was found, are pygmies. This fact is consistent with either theory. One line of attack on \"H. floresiensis\" is that it was found with tools only associated with \"H. sapiens\".\nStone artifacts have been found on Flores which can be dated to a million years ago. These artifacts are \"proxies\"; which means there were no skeletons of humans, but only a species of \"Homo\" could have made them. The artifacts are flakes and other implements, 48 in all, some of which show signs of being worked to produce a cutting edge. This means that humans were present on Flores by that date, but it does not tell us which species that was.\n\"Homo sapiens\".\n\"Homo sapiens\" has lived from about 250,000 years ago to the present. Between 400,000 years ago and the second warm period in the Middle Pleistocene, around 250,000 years ago, its skull grew and more sophisticated technologies based on stone tools developed. One possibility is that a transition between \"H. erectus\" to \"H. sapiens\" occurred. The evidence of Java Man suggests there was an initial migration of \"H. erectus\" out of Africa. Then, much later, a further development of \"H. sapiens\" from \"H. erectus\" in Africa. Then a subsequent migration within and out of Africa eventually replaced the earlier \"H. erectus\".\nOut of Africa.\nStudies of the human genome, especially the Y-chromosome DNA and mitochondrial DNA, have supported a recent African origin. Evidence from autosomal DNA also supports the recent African origin. The details of this great saga are not fully established yet, but by about 90,000 years ago they had moved into Eurasia and the Middle East. This was the area where Neanderthals, \"Homo neanderthalensis\", had been living for a long time (at least 500,000 years in western Europe).\nBy about 42 to 44,000 years ago \"Homo sapiens\" had reached western Europe, including Britain. In Europe and western Asia, \"Homo sapiens\" replaced the Neanderthals by about 35,000 years ago. The details of how this happened are not known.\nAt roughly the same time \"Homo sapiens\" arrived in Australia (However a recent archaeological dig in Kakadu, Northern Territory, may suggest \"Homo sapiens\" arrived in Australia 65,000 years ago). Their arrival in the Americas was much later, about 15,000 years ago. All these earlier groups of modern man were hunter-gatherers.\nCurrent research has established that human beings are genetically rather homogenous (similar). The DNA of individuals is more alike than usual for most species. This may have resulted from their relatively recent evolution or from the Toba catastrophe. Distinctive genetic have arisen as a result of small groups of people moving into new environmental circumstances. These adapted traits are a very small component of the \"Homo sapiens\" genome and include such outward 'racial' characteristics as skin color and nose shape, and internal characteristics such as the ability to breathe more efficiently at high altitudes.\n\"H. sapiens idaltu\", from Ethiopia, about 160,000 years ago, is a proposed subspecies. It is the oldest known anatomically modern human.\nSpecies list.\nThis list is in chronological order by genus."}

Roman civilization was the most important civilization in the Mediterranean region, Europe, and the Near East from the late 3rd century BC. Roman civilization was in existence all through Classical Antiquity, Late Antiquity, and the Middle Ages, but \"ancient Rome\" means the ancient history of Roman civilization before the Middle Ages. Traditionally, the fall of the western Roman Empire during the 5th century AD is named the start of the Middle Ages in western Europe.\nIn Classical Antiquity, the Roman Empire controlled a very large area of land, which stretched from Great Britain to the Arabian Peninsula. Ancient Rome has been very important to the history of Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, where the Romans controlled many lands. Ancient Rome's culture took many ideas from other civilizations, especially Ancient Greece and the Greek kingdoms of the Hellenistic period. Ancient Romans' ideas have been very influential for later civilizations. The Romans' Latin language became the most common language in the western Mediterranean and western Europe, and is the ancestor of Romance languages. The Roman emperors were responsible for making Christianity the Romans' state religion, and the Romans spread Christianity across the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity. Roman Christianity replaced Roman religion and other traditional religions. The Romans made many improvements to engineering, architecture, irrigation, and transport.\nHistory.\nRome began as a small farming community in the 8th century BC. The city of Rome was founded, according to legend, on 21 April 753 BC. It became a city and a state and had the , which Roman mythology said came from their first king, Romulus. Rome was first a kingdom, but its last king, Tarquinius Superbus, was sent away in a revolution started by Lucius Junius Brutus. The Roman state became a republic. The city-state grew to control the Italian Peninsula during the Hellenistic period, and fought the Punic Wars with the Carthaginian Republic. After overcoming the Carthaginians, the Roman Republic became the most powerful state in the western Mediterranean.\nThe Romans became the most powerful state in the eastern Mediterranean after wars with Macedonia, and the Mithridatic Wars with Kingdom of Pontus. The Hellenistic period and the Roman Republic ended when, after Julius Caesar was assassinated, the Romans fought a long civil war. At the end of these wars, Augustus overcame his Roman enemies and the Ptolemaic dynasty, who controlled the kingdom of Egypt. Augustus became the first Roman emperor and Roman civilization controlled all the lands around the Mediterranean Sea.\nIn 293\u00a0AD, Diocletian split the government of the empire into two parts, east and west. From Diocletian's time there was usually more than one emperor at a time, each controlling a part of the empire. In the 5th century AD, the lands of the western Roman Empire split up into different kingdoms. After Romulus Augustulus there were no more emperors in the western empire, and the government of the western Roman Empire ended in 476\u00a0AD. In Western Europe, this is the end of Antiquity and the start of the Early Middle Ages. The Romans lost control of Rome and most of the Italian Peninsula. After that, the Roman Empire in the Middle Ages is sometimes named the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire. Historians use this name because the Romans' capital city was Constantinople (also called Byzantium), and its emperors controlled the eastern half of the Mediterranean Basin. The Roman Empire was in existence until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, when it was defeated by the Ottoman Empire.\nCulture.\nRoman culture spread to Western Europe and the area around the Mediterranean Sea. Its history still has a big influence on the world today. For example, Roman ideas about laws, government, art, literature, and language are important to European culture. The Roman language, Latin, slowly evolved, becoming modern French, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, and many other languages. Latin also indirectly influenced many other languages such as English.\nReligion.\nGraeco-Roman polytheism.\nThe most common religion of ancient Rome in its first centuries was Graeco-Roman polytheism. The traditional religion of the city of Rome was polytheist (with many gods). The most important gods were the Capitoline triad: three gods worshipped on the Capitoline Hill. The three were Jupiter (the father and king of the gods), Juno (the queen of the gods), and Minerva (the goddess of wisdom). The goddess Minerva was born without a mother from the body of Jupiter. Roman mythology said that among the Romans' ancestors were Venus (goddess of love) and Mars (a god of war and the son of Jupiter and Juno). The gods Apollo and Bacchus were taken by the Romans from Greek mythology, and many of the Romans' religious practices were the same as those of the ancient Greeks. The Romans also worshipped the goddesses Cybele and Isis, whose cults they took from Hellenistic Anatolia and Egypt.\nRoman worship often took the form of sacrifices. Romans tried to please the gods by giving food or other gifts to the gods and to other deities, including the souls of dead people. With sacrifices like this, the Romans hoped to avoid bad luck and bring good luck, such as fertility and a successful harvest, or victory in war. The Romans built temples to house the images of their gods. These images were usually statues, and the Romans would offer sacrifices by burning food or frankincense. Precious objects would be given to the gods in rituals and stored in the temples. The Romans believed this pleased the gods. The Romans also did ritual purification, to avoid bad luck and to avoid offending the gods and spirits.\nJudaeo-Christian monotheism.\nJudaism was common in the ancient Roman world, and there was a Jewish diaspora in many cities, like Rome, from the Hellenistic period. Christianity started in the eastern Roman Empire, in Hellenistic Judaea. In Classical Antiquity, the Roman government did not like Christianity. Sometimes, Roman governors or emperors ordered the persecution of Christians. Under the emperor Diocletian, the persecution of Christians became the strongest. Christianity became an officially supported religion in the Roman Empire under Constantine I. With the signing of the Edict of Milan by Licinius and Constantine in 313, it became the most powerful religion, and the Christian Church began the persecution of Christians with whom the official (\"orthodox\" and \"catholic\") disagreed. Then, in 391\u00a0AD, an edict of Theodosius I made Christianity Rome's official religion. The state church of the Roman Empire became the state religion in the empire. (The state church later split into the modern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.)\nPeople practising traditional, non-Christian religions were common in Late Antiquity. The Christians called these people \"pagans\". There was persecution of Graeco-Roman polytheism by the Roman emperors. Starting in the 5th century, non-Christian religions' property was taken away, and many Roman temples were made into churches.\nThe Eastern Empire.\nThe Byzantines were threatened by the rise of Islam, whose followers took over the territories of Syria, Armenia and Egypt and soon threatened to take over Constantinople. In the next century, the Arabs also captured southern Italy and Sicily.\nThe Byzantines survived during the 8th century and, beginning in the 9th century, took back parts of the conquered lands. In 1000\u00a0AD, the Eastern Empire was at its largest point, and culture and trade flourished. However, the expansion was suddenly stopped in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert. This finally made the empire start becoming weaker. After centuries of fighting and Turkic invasions, Emperor Alexius I Comnenus called for help from the West in 1095.\nThe West responded with the Crusades, eventually resulting in the Fourth Crusade which conquered Constantinople in 1204. Several Roman states took pieces of the now smaller empire. After the recapture of Constantinople by the Romans, the empire was little more than a Greek-speaking state confined to the coast of the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara. The empire came to an end when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.\nArchaeology.\nRemains of Roman work and architecture have been found in the furthest corners of the late Empire."}
{"id": "24300", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24300", "title": "Globalization", "text": "Globalization is the connection of different parts of the world resulting in the expansion of international cultural, economic, and political activities. It is the movement and integration of goods and people among different countries. There are advantages and disadvantages to globalization, all of which have economic, social, political, and cultural impacts. Globalization describes mainly trade practices, extending also to the communication patterns and cultural system that underlie these practices.\nDefinition.\nIt is a term which may be used broadly to mean doing things as distant people do them, or more narrowly to mean complying to global standards in economy, politics, culture, education, environment or other matters. It describes the way countries and people of the world interact and integrate. Many things have become globalized as people come into contact.\nEconomic globalization is how countries are coming together as one big global economy, This is all making international trade easier. In the late 20th century, many people agreed to lower tariffs, or taxes on goods that are imported from other countries. Telegraphy and bull other communication technologies have helped people to buy and sell products from around the world, thus bringing globalization. Herman E. Daly has said that there is an important difference between internationalization and globalization. Internationalization is about nations working together for the same goals. These are things like treaties, alliances, and other international agreements. Globalization is about international trade that are \nbeing less blocked by national borders.\nPolitical globalization is how institutions and countries can influence the whole world. The United Nations are an example of globalization because most countries of the world are members of its General Assembly. This international organization can make countries follow rules and apply economic sanctions to a country that doesn't. This means the countries in the U.N will punish them by not talking or trading with them, so they don't benefit from globalization.\nCultural globalization is how culture is becoming homogeneous, which means that people from all over the world act in similar way. For example, many people around the world write with the Latin alphabet, wear T-shirts and jeans and watch Hollywood movies and other media.\nCriticism.\nSome people, like Noam Chomsky, do not like globalization because they feel it only helps rich people get richer by making poor people poorer. Offshore outsourcing, such as a company hiring workers in a developing country, is often a part of globalization. This sometimes means that some people in a developed country lose their jobs. Joseph Stiglitz said that international groups like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have made it harder for poorer nations to get richer. Globalization also means that problems from other countries will affect your country. For example, the Great Depression of the 1930s started in the United States but affected the entire world.\nMany countries also dislike it when international organizations such as the United Nations tell them what to do. However they obey to avoid sanctions. Many people also criticize the fact that globalization means that fewer people are deciding what brands, like Coca-Cola and McDonald's, taking over smaller, local shops and businesses. They criticize the fact that powerful countries have bigger influence on world culture than others. For example, the United States is the biggest cultural exporter, which means that countries around the world are becoming like the United States. However, this hurts local cultures. Jean Baudrillard believes that globalization hurts local cultures and is the cause of most terrorism. He also believes that most supporters of globalization just want to stay in power.\nGregory Meyjes interprets globalization as a largely hegemonic, unequal process of socio-cultural imposition. Questioning the various processes (economic, political, cultural) by which\u00a0globalization\u00a0or\u00a0globalisation has favored rapid Anglo-cultural dominance over a more gradual, egalitarian evolution towards an inclusive world civilization, Meyjes argues for cultural policies that support \"ecological\" relations between local ethnocultural traditions, by protecting cultural specificity in the short term and allow as many cultural groups as possible to organically contribute to the whole. At the global level, Meyjes therefore proposes the term universalization or\u00a0universalisation to denote a process of (largely) non-imposed socio-cultural exchange between state-level and sub-state-level groups and \"nations\" \u2013 i.e. a transnational process that informs the gradual emergence of a universal civilization.\nSupport.\nOthers, like Thomas Friedman, believe that globalization can bring people together and make everyone richer without getting rid of local cultures. People who support globalization also believe that it makes war less likely because it is bad for business. Francis Fukuyama also argued that globalization would eventually lead to a system of world governance which would cause wars to end.\nMany believe that globalization helps out poorer nations by bringing them business. A report by the World Bank said that poverty in India and Indonesia was cut in half because of globalization. The report also said that people in poorer nations are living longer and better because they were making more money."}

It is traditional music that people learn by listening to other people playing it and then copying them. We say that the tradition is \u201corally transmitted\u201d or \u201chanded down orally\u201d, meaning that the music is not written down but taught by speaking (\u201coral\u201d means \u201cbelonging to the mouth\u201d). Every country has its own traditional music. Folk song is part of folk music. A folksinger is a person who sings folk songs.\nThere are three categories of Folk Music -\nIn the 1960s a new type of music was started by Bob Dylan who mixed traditional folk song with rock and roll. This music is sometimes called \u201cfolk rock\u201d . \nFolk music is music for everybody to play and listen to. In this way it is different from classical music which is mainly developed by professional musicians for a smaller group of people. Folk music is part of a popular culture, although the term \u201cpopular music\u201d or \u201cpop music\u201d today refers to a kind of music which people can hear through television, radio and other means of recording.\nIn many parts of the world nearly all music is folk music. The term \u201cfolk music\u201d is usually used for European and American music which is part of an oral tradition. Folk music as an oral tradition, is much less important than before, in part because of new technology (radio, television etc, and recordings of music ). Folk tunes are now often written down, and they have influenced other kinds of music, so that the differences between various types of music are harder to see.\nThe traditional origins.\nIn older times folk music was part of \u201ccommunal recreation\u201d. This means that small communities such as villages or families would relax by playing and singing music together. People would often make up a new song or new piece of music, or make changes to music that they already knew. In this way music was always changing. People would get musical ideas from other groups nearby. This is why folk music from neighbouring countries often sound similar.\nBallads were a popular kind of folk music. These were folk songs which told a story (they were \u201cnarrative\u201d). Sometimes they had a refrain after each verse so that everybody could join in. Ballads told stories of love, myths or folklore. This is how stories were handed down from one generation to another.\nInstrumental folk music was used for dancing. Some of the instruments may have been very simple, such as a pair of sticks, rattle or a simple drum. Other instruments may include fiddle (the folk word for \u201cviolin\u201d), bagpipes, harp, zither, or various wind instruments, depending on the time of history and the country.\nSome singing was polyphonic, i.e. there were two or more parts (voices). Very often two voices would sing in parallel (going up and down together). In countries such as Russia persons sings in three or four parts, e.g. in the tradition of \u201cpodgolosnaya\u201d (\u201cunderneath the voice\u201d). In countries such as Britain this polyphonic tradition did not exist. Folk songs there were sung by one singer, unaccompanied.\nFolk music used different scales. These are called modes. The Ionian mode (like our major scale) was the most common in Western Europe. In some parts of Eastern Europe modes with several semitones were used, but for the most part, half steps were avoided. This results is the tunes being described as tetratonic (four notes per octave) or pentatonic (five notes per octave).\nFolk music also includes simple children\u2019s songs and lullabies.\nFolk music was sung by people as they worked. In the early days of European immigration in America the pioneers sang as they travelled, cowboys sang as they worked, slaves sang in the cottonfields.\nInfluence on classical music.\nIn the 18th century folk music started to have an influence on classical music (or \u201cart music\u201d). People from the higher classes started to be interested in folk music because they were conscious of being part of a tradition. Composers such as Mozart and Schubert wrote folk dances for orchestras or small groups of instruments.\nFolk music was used by many composers in the Romantic period. Gustav Mahler used folk song in a lot of his music. In the early twentieth century some composers travelled around collecting folk music which was being played or sung by people in the country. They often used some of these ideas in their music. Bartok did this in Hungary as well as in Bulgaria and in the United States, and people such as Cecil Sharp and the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams collected folk music in England. In the United States the influence of jazz on classical music is all part of the story of folk music."}

{"id": "24322", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24322", "title": "Babylonia", "text": "Babylonia was a city state in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, over 3000 years ago. Its capital city was Babylon, which meant \"The Gate of the Gods\". They built an empire out of the lands of the former Akkadian empire.\nMesopotamia is the region of the two rivers, Euphrates and Tigris. At that time the region also included the city states of Assyria to the north, and Elam to the south-east. It is part of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. It was there people first lived together in a civilization, with farming, cities and writing. \nOld Babylonia.\nThe Babylonians had a written language that they used for trade and communication. They got it from the Sumerians, who invented it. The Babylonians used the same cuneiform system of pressing triangular shapes into soft clay. They wrote in two different languages: Sumerian for religious purposes and Akkadian language for official purposes.\nLaws.\nHammurabi was a king of Babylon who fought wars and made Babylonia into an empire by putting Assyria under a vassal (puppet) king. He created the earliest written set of laws, called the \"Code of Hammurabi\". It has 280 judgments and can be seen today in the Louvre, a museum in Paris. Whereas the earlier Sumerian punishments had not been harsh, Babylonian law was quite severe. The death penalty was given for theft, murder, and other crimes.\nBuildings.\nThe houses in Babylon had open roofs, so that on hot nights, the family could sleep there. The living rooms, dining rooms, and the kitchens were, of course, downstairs. Lamps burned with olive oil, and every house had a chapel for burial and worship ceremonies. Since Mesopotamia had only clay for use in building, the strong wooden supports for the houses were imported from Lebanon. Eventually, people began baking their bricks and improved the strength of their buildings.\nSack of Babylon.\nLater, Babylon was sacked by the Hittite king Musilis I, which led to the so-called 'Dark Ages' of the Bronze Age, where there is little evidence in writing. The date of the sacking of Babylon is debated by archaeologists, who have proposed no fewer than four chronologies. Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are:\nThe difficulty is to line up the Mesopotamian dates with the Ancient Egyptian dates.\nLater dynasties.\nAfter the Hittite destruction, Babylon was ruled by Kassites for 576 years. Next it was ruled by Elam, and then regained its independence for about three centuries. They were then conquered by the Neo-Assyrians. A century later they again became free, to form the Neo-Babylonian or Chaldean Empire. This constant conquest and re-conquest is partly due to geography. There are no natural boundaries except the rivers, and it is easy to get at the cities from north or south.\nThe king Nebuchadnezzar II reigned for 43 years. He conquered Phoenicia in 585 BC.\nCyrus the Great.\nThe Babylonian empire was finally brought to an end by Cyrus the Great of Persia. \nIt was in 549 BC that Cyrus put an end to the empire of the Medes. Three years later Cyrus had become king of the Achaemenid Empire (Persia), and was engaged in a campaign in northern Mesopotamia. \nIn 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia. A battle was fought at Opis in the month of June, where the Babylonians were defeated; and immediately afterwards Sippara surrendered to the invader. Two days after the capture of Sippara, \"the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting\". Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of \"Marchesvan\" (October), Gobryas having acted for him in his absence. Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon.\nCyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of their god Bel-Marduk. The invasion of Babylonia by Cyrus was doubtless helped by the presence of foreign forced exiles like the Jews, who had been planted in the midst of the country.\nOne of the first acts of Cyrus was to allow these exiles to return to their own homes, carrying with them the images of their god and their sacred vessels. The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation, whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne. The feeling was still strong that none had a right to rule over western Asia until he had been consecrated to the office by Bel and his priests; and accordingly, Cyrus henceforth assumed the imperial title of \"King of Babylon.\"\nFood.\nLike the Sumerians, the Babylonians ate vegetables, fruits, meat, and fish. They also ate bread and enjoyed toasting and eating the pesky but crunchy locusts which destroyed their precious crops.\nArt and science.\nThe Babylonians loved art. Beautiful vessels ornamented with sparkling gold were buried with the kings. In those days books dealt with floods which were thought to be caused by sin, or about the journey of Abraham. \nScience, too, improved well: they invented the first calendar, the 60-minute hour, and the advance multiplication table.\nLife was rich, full, and usually peaceful. People rarely thought about war or how to protect the city. As a result, Babylon was conquered in 730 BC by the Assyrians and Kassites. This great civilization then ended."}

{"id": "24328", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24328", "title": "Karma", "text": "Karma is a word meaning the result of a person's actions as well as the actions themselves. It is a term about the cycle of cause and effect. According to the theory of Karma, what happens to a person, happens because they caused it with their actions. It is an important part of many religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. In Shinto (a religion often syncretised with Buddhism), Karma is interpreted as \"Musubi\" (\u3080\u3059\u3073), a view of karma is recognized in Shinto as a means of enriching, empowering and life affirming.\nIn terms of spiritual development, Karma is about all that a person has done, is doing and will do. Karma is logically about punishment or reward. It makes a person responsible for their own life, and how they treat other people.\nThe \"Theory of Karma\" is a major belief in Hinduism, Ayyavazhi, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism. All living creatures are responsible for their karma - their actions and the effects of their actions.\nDefinition.\n Karma is often misconstrued as the universal principle of cause and effect. Our actions, both good and bad, come back to us in the future, helping us to learn from life\u2019s lessons and become better people. In religions that include reincarnation, karma extends through one's present life and all past and future lives as well.\nKarma is basically energy. One person throws out energy through thoughts, words and actions, and it comes back, in time, through other people. Karma is the best teacher, forcing people to face the consequences of their own actions and thus improve and refine their behavior, or suffer if they do not. Even harsh karma, when faced in wisdom, can be the greatest spark for spiritual growth. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and unemotional response.\nSupporting any action, with the claim, \"I am doing it,\" is karma. Claiming doership of any action, binds karma. To support the action with the belief 'I am the doer' is called binding the karma. It is this support of the belief of 'doership' that binds karma. If you know that you are not the doer and are aware of who the true doer is, 'I am not the doer' and 'who is the doer' then the action will not have any support and the karma will be shed.\nExamples of karma.\nThe process of action and reaction on all levels\u2014physical, mental and spiritual\u2014is karma. One must pay attention to thoughts, because thought can make karmas\u2014good, bad and mixed.\n\u201cI say kind words to you, and you feel peaceful and happy. I say harsh words to you, and you become ruffled and upset. The kindness and the harshness will return to me, through others, at a later time. Finally, what I give is what I get back.\u201d\n\u201cAn architect thinks creative, productive thoughts while drawing plans for a new building. But were he to think destructive, unproductive thoughts, he would soon not be able to accomplish any kind of positive task even if he desired to do so.\u201d\nKarma in Hinduism.\nHindus look at time as a circle, as things cycle around again. Karma is a very just law which, like gravity, treats everyone the same. The law of karma puts man at the center of responsibility for everything he does and everything that is done to him. Understanding the way karma works, Hindus try to live a virtuous life. This is called dharma.\nThere are three types of karma in Hinduism:\nThe role of divine forces.\nKarma is considered one of the natural laws of the mind, just as gravity is a law of matter. Just as God created gravity to bring order to the physical world, He created karma as a divine system of justice that is self-governing and infinitely fair. It automatically creates the appropriate future experience in response to the current action.\nSeveral different views exist in Hinduism regarding the role of divine beings. In Hinduism, many see the deities or devas as playing some kind of role. Other Hindus, such as the Mimamsakas, reject such notions and see karma as acting independently, considering the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma.\nSome interpretations of the Bhagavad Gita suggest an intermediate view, that karma is a law of cause and effect yet God can mitigate karma for His devotees. It is said in Bhagavad Gita that only the karma that is done with a sense of doership and with attachment to the karma could cause good or bad reactions. Karma that is done with an attitude of duty and without attachment to the results will not create any effect and will move one closer to God.\nAnother view holds that a Satguru, acting on God's behalf, can mitigate or work out some of the karma of the disciple."}

It is relatively easy to make and is used by irregular paramilitary forces and by rioters. It is also used for arson.\nIt was used for the first time in the Spanish Civil War between July 1936 and April 1939, but it became known as \"Molotov cocktails\" only during the Second World War.\nMechanism.\nA Molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with a flammable liquid. The liquid will typically be gasoline, alcohol, methanol or ethanol. The mouth of the bottle is closed with a cork or other type of tight sealing made of rubber, glass, or plastic, and a cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth. The weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately before using it, lighting the rag, and throwing the bottle at the target. The bottle breaks when it lands, spilling the flammable liquid over the target, which is then ignited by the burning rag.\nMany substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon. These include:\nMolotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle. Napalm was originally made by combining flammable naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid. The latter two are the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails. When gasoline is used as the main ingredient, motor oil is commonly added to help the gasoline cling to the target.\nOrigin of name.\nThe name \"Molotov cocktail\" is derived from Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, a Soviet politician. He was the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, or the Foreign Minister, of the Soviet Union.\nDuring the early part of World War II, when Finland refused to surrender some land to the Soviet Union, the Soviets invaded it. The poorly equipped and heavily-outnumbered Finnish Army faced Red Army tanks in what came to be known as the Winter War. The army borrowed an improvised incendiary device from the 1936\u201339 Spanish Civil War. In that conflict, the Spanish Nationalists under the orders of General Francisco Franco had used the weapon against Soviet T-26 tanks. Those tanks helped the Spanish Republicans in a failed 1936 Soviet assault near Toledo, 30\u00a0km from Madrid.\nWhen Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs but rather delivering food to the starving Finns, the Finns started to call the air bombs satirically \"Molotov bread baskets\". Soon they responded by saluting the advancing tanks with \"Molotov cocktails.\" At first the term was used to describe only the burning mixture itself, but the term was soon applied to the combination of both the bottle and its contents. This Finnish use of the hand- or sling-thrown explosive against Soviet tanks was repeated in the subsequent Continuation War. Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Finnish military, bundled with matches to light them.\nThese weapons saw widespread use by all sides in World War II. They were very effective against light tanks, and very bad for enemy morale. The following is a first-hand description of their effects, written during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943:\nDuring the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, members of the Israeli Kibbutz Degania managed to stop a Syrian tank assault by using Molotov cocktails. They were frequently used against Soviet tanks with great efficiency in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.\nThe weapon has been used against tanks effectively because of the conformation of parts of tanks, particularly around the undersides and fuel tank \"entrances\". A Molotov cocktail could blow up the fuel tank, destroying the machine, particularly for older (before 1940) tank models. Molotov cocktails are much more effective against gasoline engines than diesel engines' tanks. This is because diesel has a high flashpoint of 64\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 making it more difficult to ignite compared to petrol. Some Soviet tanks actually had an entry to the gas tank on the side of the vehicle, which could be opened by combatants in close quarters, letting out the highly flammable liquid and making destruction of the tank even easier. These tactics are effective only inside a small space, where tanks cannot easily maneuver. In such conditions quick-moving enemies, armed with incendiary bombs, have a huge advantage.\nPetrol bombs were widely used throughout the Troubles in Northern Ireland in riot situations, directed towards the RUC or the British Army. As well as occasional situations where they continue to be used against the PSNI and army, they are frequently used in sectarian attacks on homes and businesses by both communities. Fireworks and homemade grenades, known as blast bombs now commonly accompany petrol bomb attacks on the security forces.\nLegal concerns.\nAs such things can cause a lot of damage, and actually kill people, it is illegal in most countries to make or possess them. When they are used against property, this usually counts as \"arson\". When they are used against people, the charges range from manslaughter to murder.\nGiven the recent terrorism laws, such things could also fall under anti-terror legislation.\nRecent use.\nMolotov cocktails were put to use recently during the riotous 2005 civil unrest in France. Another situation with popularity for them is the Palestinian Intifada.\nIn Sydney, during the Cronulla Riots, rioters carrying Molotov cocktails were apprehended when they carried open bottles in a bus. The resulting smell of petrol alerted the driver, who in turn alerted the police.\nDuring the Columbine High School massacre, the two gunmen built and threw several Molotov cocktails; however, none of them exploded. It is presumed that this was due to bottles being overfilled."}

People sometimes get confused and think that \"inflammable\" means \"not flammable\" because the prefix \"in\" is often used to mean \"not\". For example, something that is inhuman is not human.

Air and mucus (the liquid found in the nose) are forced out quickly. Sneezing often happens after breathing dust or other small things that irritate the membranes in the nose. The function of sneezing is to clean the space in the nose by removing the mucus and irritating things. Sneezing is mostly involuntary, which means that it happens without trying. \nA sneeze consists of a deep inward breath that fills the lungs, a closing or partial closing of the throat, and a sudden increase in pressure in the lungs that forces air out. This increase in pressure is a result of muscles near the lungs that contract (tighten and shorten). Sneezing never happens during sleep because reflex signals do not pass to the part of the brain that causes muscles to move. When people sneeze, their eyes close. The speed of the air from sneezing is about 150 kilometers per hour or more. \nMany animals sneeze, including human beings, cats, dogs, chickens and iguanas.\nWhen a person sneezes, many small drops of saliva and mucus blow out from the nose and mouth. These tiny drops often contain viruses and bacteria. Some of these are germs, which can make other people sick. To keep this from happening as much, is important to block the sneezed air with something like cloth or tissue to catch the drops. It also helps to move away from other people, go outside, or face away.\nA common thing to say to people when they sneeze is \"Bless you!\", or sometimes in the United States sometimes \"Gesundheit!\" (from German, meaning \"Good health\"). There is a story that the blessing started with Pope Gregory VII (540\u2013604\u00a0AD). He said a blessing might stop people from getting the bubonic plague which was killing people in Rome at the time. There is a myth that when you sneeze your heart and all internal organs stop functioning.\nThe sound of a sneeze is written \"achoo!\" in English. Other languages write it differently. For example, in Swedish it is \"atjoo!\", in French it is \"atchoum!\" and in German it is \"Hatschi!\". \nSome involuntary ways that people move air in or out of the lungs are: to sneeze, laugh, cough, hiccup, or yawn.

Pumas are mainly tan-color, and can be up to 9 feet long, although average length is 6 \u2013 8 feet. They can weigh from 29 kilograms to 90 kilograms. (The males are larger.) Most pumas live up to 21 years. Although pumas are very large and some are larger than humans, the puma is classified as a small cat. That means that, in scientific terms, the puma is more closely related to the domestic cat than they are to lions. Unlike the big cats in the genus \"Panthera\", the puma cannot roar. Instead, it can growl, hiss, screech, and purr. Since pumas are, in the biological sense, small cats, they are capable of purring continuously. The big cats can only purr while breathing out. \nPumas are carnivores because they eat only meat. Pumas are apex predators. They hunt deer, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, rabbits and skunks. They can also eat mice, beavers, coyotes, bobcats, birds, porcupines, cattle, goats, fish and bear cubs. They hunt at night. Cougars can see better at night than people can. They can hear well too. Pumas stalk their prey, which means they walk slowly and quietly, they hide and then when close, they jump or run fast to catch their prey by surprise. They live and hunt alone. Female cougars take care of their babies until they are old enough to take care for themselves. Baby cougars are called cubs or kittens.\nPumas live in the mountains and forests far from people. However, encounters with humans happen sometimes. 26 people have been killed by cougars in North America in the last 30 years. However, many more cougars have been killed by humans. Cougars used to be found all in eastern North America, but they were hunted to extinction there by the beginning of the 1900s. Also, recent sightings of cougars have been reported from Michigan, New Brunswick, southern Indiana, Kentucky, and Vermont. For now, the only confirmed, population of cougars east of the Mississippi River is in Florida, where a subspecies of the cougar called the Florida Panther lives.\nSchool Mascots.\nSchools that have a cougar as their mascot include:"}

{"id": "24403", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24403", "title": "Pipe organ", "text": "The pipe organ is a keyboard instrument in which the sound is made by air blowing through pipes. A person who plays the organ is called an organist. The organist plays the instrument using both the hands and the feet. The hands play the keyboards (called manuals), while the feet play pedals which also make notes.\nOrgans have been made for many centuries. They are usually found in places for Christian worship such as churches and cathedrals, although they may also be found in places like town halls and concert halls or even large private houses. Very small organs can be called \u201cchamber organs\u201d. Organs in large churches, cathedrals or halls are very large instruments indeed, and are built especially for the building they are in. They are called \u201cpipe organs\u201d to distinguish them from modern \u201celectronic organs\u201d.\nNo two organs are ever quite the same, and they vary greatly from one country to another and one historical period to another. The information here is about organs from Europe, Great Britain and America.\nHow an organ works.\nA description of the organ.\nIn a pipe organ, the musical notes are made by blowing air through pipes. Every organ must have pipes, something to blow the air and a way of controlling which pipes are played.\nThe pipes are made of metal or wood. They are lined up in rows in the \"organ case\" which can be as big as a room. The metal pipes are round tubes. They can be made of different types of metal, but the most common type is an alloy (or mixture of metals) of tin and lead called \"spotted metal\" because it has round shiny spots on it. This alloy makes pipes sound good as the harder tin provides clarity and definition while the softer lead produces tonal warmth. Very small pipes can sometimes be made of silver, like flutes. Some organs also have some pipes made of brass that sound like trumpets. Most organs have a lot of wooden pipes. The wooden pipes have four flat sides and make a sound different from that of the \"spotted metal\" pipes. They are not usually seen; they are neatly lined up behind the large metal pipes at the front of the organ which are sometimes painted with colours and patterns. All the pipes have to be made with an end that tapers at the bottom where the air blows in.\nEach pipe can play only one note which depends on its size. The small pipes play high notes and the large pipes play low notes. Each pipe has its own special sound which depends on the material it is made from (whether it is wood or brass or spotted metal) and on the shape of the pipe. The pipes are arranged in \"ranks\" so that all the pipes of the same shape and material can be controlled to play a tune together, without all the others.\nTo blow air through the organ, there are boxes called \"wind chests\". When the organist is playing, he/she can see a little gauge that tells whether there is enough air. The wind chests can be kept full in two ways. The old-fashioned way is to have an enormous set of \"bellows\" which are pumped up and down by a person using a large handle. This sucks in air and fills the wind chest. Pumping the bellows of a large pipe organ is heavy work. For this reason, most organs nowadays have an electric motor and a large fan which fills the wind chest.\nThe organist uses keyboards like those on a piano to play the organ. A small organ may have just one keyboard, but many organs have two keyboards and a very big one may even have five. Organists do not call them keyboards; they call them \"manuals\". An organist will talk about \"a four-manual organ\" (which means it is a large one). The manuals are arranged on the organ \"console\", and the organist sits on a bench in front of the console to play. Apart from the manuals there are two other important parts of the console. There are a set of long wooden pedals which the organist can play with his/her feet. Each pedal plays a different note.\nOn either side of the manuals there are rows of \"stops\" which look like knobs. The stops can be pulled out or pushed in. When a stop is pulled out, it turns on some sets of pipes. The organist can choose whether to play loud pipes or soft pipes, flute-sounding pipes or brassy pipes, sweet pipes or harsh-sounding pipes. As the organist plays, he/she does not just have to think about the right notes. He/she also has to think about the sort of \"voice\" that the organ should play in. He/she can play different ranks of pipes together by pulling out several stops. Some pipes, usually the biggest decorated pipes at the very front of the organ, are used only for the grandest music. By tradition, these pipes are the symbol of the \"Voice of God\".\nWhen the organist presses the keys of the organ, the sound comes from the air blowing through the pipes. This is because a valve (an opening with a one-way door) opens up to let the air into the pipe, and closes again when the organist stops pressing that key. This can happen in several ways. Traditional organs have what is called a \"tracker action\". The trackers are thin wooden rods and wires which move backwards and forwards, opening and shutting all the valves. They are worked by levers under the keyboard. A tracker action organ has to have the console right near the organ, usually under the big front pipes.\nA more modern development was to have a \"tubular pneumatic\" action, in which the console could be away from the organ, but connected to it by tubes through which air could be pushed to open the valves. In the most modern pipe organs, the manual is connected to the organ pipes by electric wires. The power to open and shut the valves is controlled by electro-magnetic switches. The console does not have to be close to the organ. This makes it possible for the organist to sit in a position where he/she has good contact with the people in the church, or with other musicians.\nThe technical details.\nThe manuals.\nA very small organ may only have one manual (keyboard). Most organs have at least two. In English and American Organs the lower manual is the main one and is called the \"Great\". The upper manual is called the \"Swell\" because it operates pipes which are inside a \u201cswell box\u201d which has that can be opened or closed. This makes the music get louder or quieter (crescendo or diminuendo). The organist operates the swell box with a pedal which (rocks to and fro). It is in the centre just above the pedal board. On old English organs the swell box is operated by a lever at the side. This is quite difficult to use. Most of these have now been replaced by central swell boxes.\nIf there is a third manual, it is called the \"Choir\" in English-speaking countries. Originally the English called them \u201cchair organs\u201d because they were a separate instrument. The organist had to turn round and face the other way to play it. It is thought that the word \"chair\" gradually changed to \"choir\" because it was often used to accompany the choir. In German organs the third manual was called the \u201cPositiv\u201d. The name \u201cR\u00fcckpositiv\u201d (\u201cback positive\u201d) was used because the pipes were behind the organist\u2019s back as he/she sat facing the main organ. These started to become popular again with organ builders in the 1950s when it was felt that the Romantic organ was not suitable for old music, and some organ builders started using Baroque principles again so that the music of composers such as Bach could sound like it used to. The Choir manual is nearest to the player, the Great is in the middle and the Swell is farthest away. The Choir or Positiv often contains soft stops which are suitable for accompanying the choir. On French organs from the late 19th century onwards, the three manuals are arranged differently: the Great (\u201cGrande Orgue\u201d) is nearest to the player, the \u201cPositif\u201d is the middle manual and is like a smaller version of the Great, and the Swell (\u201cRecit\u201d) is the top manual. This makes it easy for the organist to build up the music, getting louder gradually, by starting at the top and gradually coming down.\nThe fourth manual is called the \"Solo\" because the stops on this manual are used to play out the tune as a solo. This manual is even farther away from the player than the Swell. Large cathedral organs usually have four manuals. The Solo will probably have a very loud stop indeed called the \u201cTuba\u201d or \u201cTuba Mirabilis\u201d.\nIf there is a fifth manual it may be called the \"Echo\" because it has very quiet stops that echo. Alternatively, especially on American organs, it might be a \"Bombarde\". The Bombarde usually contains loud, bold reed stops, including stops called 'Bombarde'. For instance: a State Trumpet or Pontifical Trumpet might be placed on this manual which can be heard above all the other stops playing. The Bombarde is borrowed from French Organs where it is a standard stop on nearly all the manuals and pedals. Having a Bombarde Manual is something of a luxury for an organist. It can be found, for example, on the organ of Westminster Abbey.\nIt is extremely unusual to have more than five manuals, but in America there are a few very large organs. The Wanamaker organ at Macy's store in Philadelphia has six manuals. The world\u2019s largest organ is in the Atlantic City Convention Hall. It has seven manuals and over 33,000 pipes. However, the largest organ in the world does not work since it would be too expensive to run it.\nUsing the manuals.\nHaving two or three manuals makes it possible to have quick changes of sound during a piece. The player can also play on two manuals at once: one with the left hand and one with the right. This is particularly useful to make a tune louder than the accompaniment (on a piano this can be done by pressing harder). The manuals can also be coupled together, for example, pulling out the \u201cSwell to Great\u201d stop will make all the sounds from the Swell come out on the Great as well. On an organ with mechanical action the keys of the Swell will be seen \u201cplaying by themselves\u201d like a pianola, but on some older organs it can be hard work for the organist\u2019s fingers when the manuals are coupled as it makes the action very heavy.\nThe pedals.\nThe notes on the pedals are arranged like the notes on a keyboard, but are obviously much bigger. The player needs to learn to play by 'feel', otherwise he will have to spend all his time looking at his feet. He plays each note, either with the toe or the heel and either on the inside of the foot or the outside. The American and British Standard organ contains 30 notes giving a range of nearly 2 \u00bd octaves (C to F, or sometimes C to G: 32 notes). They are not quite in a straight line but fan out a little to make it easier to play (it is called a \", pedalboard\"). In German and French organs and organs built before 1920, the pedalboard will be straight without any fan curvature to it. Many organists find that this makes it more difficult to play. Organists need a good pair of shoes: ones which have good narrow heels and preferably pointed toes. The soles need to be fairly slippery, but not too much, so that the player can slide the foot from one pedal to another. Organists usually like to keep a pair of shoes which are worn only for playing the organ so that the soles do not have grit or dirt from the street.\nThe stops.\nThe stops on an organ console give different sounds, like the instruments of an orchestra, and have names which tell the organist what kind of sound they will produce. The stops are usually to the left and right of the organist and they are pulled out (\u201cdrawstops\u201d or \u201cpulls\u201d because they are \u201cdrawn\u201d i.e. pulled). Some organs have \u201ctab stops\u201d or \u201crocker stops\u201d which are in front of the player and can be rocked forwards and backwards for on/off.\nThe stops of an organ can be divided into families.\nThe \"chorus\" stops are the foundation stops, the basic ones which are good for building up the big, solid sound. A \"diapason\" or \"principal\" is a chorus stop.\nThe \"flute\" stops sound like flutes in an orchestra. They are gentler than the diapasons and sound good for very quick and light music.\nThe \"reeds\" are stops like the \"oboe\", \"clarinet\", \"trumpet\", \"fagotto\", \"trombone\". Each pipe has a reed inside. Their sound is very strong and nasal (like speaking through the nose).\nThe \"strings\" are quiet stops which sound like string instruments. These are stops like the \"violone\" and \"gamba\".\nThere is another way of grouping the stops. Each stop will have a number underneath the name. The number may be 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 or even 2 2/3 or 1 3/5. If the number is 8 this is called an \u201ceight foot stop\u201d. This is the normal pitch: the note will sound as it is written, e.g. when playing Middle C the sound will be Middle C. A 4\u00a0foot stop will sound an octave higher than written, a 2\u00a0foot stop will be two octaves higher. A 16\u00a0foot stop will sound an octave lower than an 8\u00a0foot stop. 8\u00a0foot is therefore the normal pitch, and the others are added to it to make a larger, brighter sound. 16\u00a0foot stops are normal in pedal parts.\nMutation stops are stops in which a note does not sound a whole number of octaves above the normal pitch. Examples are the Tierce 1 3/5 (which sounds 2 octaves and a third above) and the Nazard or Twelfth 2 2/3 (one octave and a fifth).\nUsing the stops.\nAn organist needs to learn which combinations of stops sound good together and how to balance them well. Each organ is different and has its own character.\nThe combination of stops that an organist chooses for a particular piece of music is called the \u201cregistration\u201d. The list of all the stops that a particular organ has is called the \u201cspecification\u201d. The specification of an organ shows the names of the stops for each of the manuals and for the pedals, as well as the list of couplers.\nOrgans also have buttons called \u201cpistons\u201d which help to change the registration in the middle of a piece. There are \u201ctoe pistons\u201d operated by the feet, and \u201cthumb pistons\u201d which are placed just below each manual so that they can be pushed by the thumb while the fingers keep playing. Large organs often have \u201cgeneral pistons\u201d which change any combination of stops across the organ. These are often be computerised so that players can set them up differently depending on the music they are going to play. If several players regularly use the instrument they can each have their own personal settings for the pistons which they can lock so that no one else can change them.\nThe pipes.\nEach stop controls a row of pipes, called a \u201crank\u201d. Each rank makes a different sound (one row for the \u201cdiapason\u201d sound, another row for the \u201cflute\u201d, another for the \u201ctrumpet\u201d and so on). The stops control the air flow through the ranks. Some stops may control more than one rank. For instance, a Mixture stop of three ranks will have 182 pipes (3 ranks of 61 pipes each) and in some organs the Celeste is a 2 rank stop. The celeste pipes are tuned slightly sharper than the rest of the organ so that, when played together with another quiet stop such as the Salicional, there will be a pleasant throbbing beat because two pipes are slightly out of tune with one another. Organ Pipes are normally made of metal or wood. High quality metal organ pipes usually contain 75 percent tin or more, and the rest is lead. The Pipes are placed on windchests inside an \"organ case\" in a special room called an Organ chamber. A windchest is a box-like device which contains pallets that are opened and closed to admit air to a pipe so that it sounds. The pallets are operated by pull wires and rollers in the case of a tracker instrument but may also be operated by pneumatics or direct electric action using magnets.\nThere is always air being pumped into the windchest when the organ is switched on. In the days before electricity someone (an organ blower) had to pump the air into the windchest using bellows. This was hard work. Large organs would have needed more than one organ blower to do this job.\nThe history of the pipe organ.\nNo other instrument has developed in such a wide variety of ways as the organ. If Bach, who lived in the early 18th century, had gone from his home in Germany to France, he would have found it impossible to play his music properly on French organs. If Couperin, who lived at the same time, had gone from his home in France to Germany, he would not have been able to play his music on the organs that Bach was using. Neither of them could possibly have played on an organ in England at the time. For one thing, English organs in the 18th century still had no pedals. This means that organists need to know a lot about what organs were like in other countries in other centuries in order to know what registrations to use when playing music by composers of the past.\nThe earliest organs.\nThe earliest organs were water organs invented in Ancient Greece. The Romans used them in circuses and gladiator combats because they were loud. They were still popular in some countries a few hundred years ago, for example, in pleasure gardens.\nThe organ in the Middle Ages.\nIn the Middle Ages large organs were built in the huge Gothic cathedrals in Britain. These instruments did not have different stops: all the ranks sounded at once. They were played by a slider mechanism. Only in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries did they start to use a keyboard. The so-called \"Mixture Organ\" (or \"Blockwerk\") still sounded several pitches at once. Very small organs called \"portatives\" (because they could be carried) were used in . \"Positives\" were a bit bigger and were used to accompany singing in the church. The \"Regal\" was like a portative but it had reeds and no pipes. It could be put on a table. The world's oldest organ is generally agreed to be the one built at Sion, Switzerland in the 15th century. the organ.\nThe organ in the Renaissance (about 1450-1600).\nBy about 1450, the organs that were being built in Germany and the Netherlands had two or three manuals and pedals. There were stops so that the player could choose which ranks he wanted to sound. The collection of pieces called the \"Buxheimer Orgelbuch\" (about 1470), is one of the first collections we have of organ music. French organs, too, were developing. In England, organs were quite small. Composers like John Bull, William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons wrote music for chamber organs. In the Netherlands Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck was a very famous organist and teacher.\nThe organ in the Baroque period (about 1600-1750).\nThe Baroque period was a great period for organ music in Germany. Organs there were built on the \"Werkprinzip\" (literally: \"work principle\") which meant that each keyboard with its pipes was built separately, like two or three different organs, although they were played from the same console. Organs like these were built by the famous Arp Schnitger (1648-1719). Many famous German composers wrote organ music, especially Johann Pachelbel (1653-1709) in South Germany and (Dietrich Buxtehude) (1637-1707) in North Germany. The great composer Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) learnt from these composers and wrote some of the most famous organ music of all times. The great organ builder Gottfried Silbermann (1683-1753) lived during this time and built organs with a very beautiful tone. Instead of a keyboard called a Choir (or Chair Organ) he built an \"Oberwerk\" which was above the \"Hauptwerk\" (Great).\nFrench organ builders at this time were very interested in colour (meaning: different sounds). Many stops had names like Cornet, Tierce and Prestant. When all the stops of the Principal chorus played together it was called the \"Plein jeux\". This was like the medieval Blockwerk. All the reed chorus together was called \"Grand jeux\". This would have sounded very loud and was used for dialogues and fugues. Composers included Nicolas de Grigny (1672-1703), Louis Marchand (1669-1732), Louis Nicolas Cl\u00e9rambault (1676-1749), Louis Claude Daquin (1694-1772) and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin (1683-1733).\nIn England there was not much interest in developing the organ. It was used for accompanying the choir. There were no pedals. Pieces for organ were called voluntaries. Henry Purcell wrote a few organ pieces.\nThe organ in the Classical period: about 1750-1840.\nOrgan composition reached a great peak in the work of J.S.Bach, but then people started to lose interest. Not many developments took place in organ-building during the Classical music period. Although Mozart played the organ and called it the \u201cKing of Instruments\u201d he did not often write music for it. Among the organ builders at this time were Joseph and Claude-Ignace Callinet who built the organ at Notre-Dame's (St. Etienne, Loire) in 1837.\nThe organ in the Romantic period.\nThe organ in 19th century Germany started to be used for imitating the sound of an orchestra. People also started to be interested in playing the music of J.S. Bach. Many Classical organs were re-built and sometimes they lost their original character. Organs in different countries started to sound the same.\nGradually, composers started writing for the organ again. Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847) wrote some excellent sonatas and preludes and fugues which were inspired by Bach\u2019s music and made other composers want to write organ music. Robert Schumann (1810-1856) and Franz Liszt (1811-1886) wrote for the organ and later in the century Max Reger (1873-1916) and Sigfrid Karg-Elert (1877-1933).\nIn France, the organ builder Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll (1811-1899) was a real genius. His organs had lots of new ideas including the Barker lever (which made it easier to play on coupled manuals) and placing families of stops on to separate chests. Organists could change their registrations quickly, pushing in or pulling out the stops that they needed. Composers included C\u00e9sar Franck (1822-1890), Charles-Marie Widor (1845-1937) and Louis Vierne (1870-1937). The last two wrote long works in several movements which they called Symphonies because they were full of colourful sounds like those in a symphony orchestra. There were usually three manuals called \"Grand\", \"Positif\" and \"R\u00e9cit\" placed in that order (with Grand nearest to the player). The Grand had warm foundation stops and big reeds (it was like combining the classical plein jeux and grand jeux). The Positif had string stops as well as a solo reed, and the R\u00e9cit had lighter reeds.\nIn England, Samuel Wesley (1766-1837) wrote some important organ music inspired by J.S. Bach, and his son Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810-1876) was influenced by Continental Romantic composers such as Mendelssohn. In 1851, the organ builder Henry Willis built a large organ for Crystal Palace Exhibition. It had three manuals and a pedal board. This set the standard in English organ building for the future.\nThe organ in the Twentieth century.\nDuring the 20th century organ builders became more and more interested in returning to some of the ideas of the Baroque and Classical periods. Many organs now have electric action, but a good mechanical action has the advantage that the player feels more close to the instrument that he is playing. Some large 20th century organs are able to play many kinds of organ music. Other 20th century organs were built as copies of Baroque or Classical instruments, but this means these instruments are mainly suitable for Baroque or Classical music, and are not well suited for music of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nIn the 19th century, many organs in England and America were placed in corners of churches where they could not be heard very well. In the 20th century, organ builders thought more about the best position for the organ, so that the sound would fill the main part of the church, the nave.\nAmong the most famous 20th century organ composers are Marcel Dupr\u00e9 (1886-1971), Jehan Alain (1911-1940) and Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992) in France, Paul Hindemith (1895-1963) in Germany, and Edward Elgar (1857-1934) and Herbert Howells (1892-1983) in England. The Czech composer Petr Eben (1929-2007) was one of the most important organ composers at the end of the 20th century, writing in an individual style.\nThe organ as an accompanying instrument.\nAs well as the obvious use of the organ for accompanying church choirs and singing the organ has often been used to accompany instruments. In the Baroque period small organs were used to accompany solo instruments or small groups of instruments or orchestras. This kind of accompaniment was called continuo. Occasionally composers have written organ concertos in which the organ is the solo instrument and the orchestra accompanies. Handel wrote several of these. In modern times Francis Poulenc wrote an organ concerto. There is an important organ solo in Symphony no 3 by Saint-Sa\u00ebns. Other orchestral works sometimes have organ parts. Organists have often made organ \u201ctranscriptions\u201d, i.e. arranged music written for other instruments so that it can be played on the organ."}

His father was Charles I, who was executed after losing a war with Parliament.\nEarly life.\nPrince Charles was the king's eldest son. As a little boy, he was made Prince of Wales as a sign that he would one day be king.\nBy the time he grew into a young man, his father was already at war with Parliament in the English Civil War.\nPrince Charles did not take much part in the fighting. His mother, Henrietta Maria, was French, and she took her children to France when the war broke out, to keep them safe. \nPrince Charles was only eighteen when he heard that his father was dead. \nThis made him King, and he started calling himself King Charles II immediately. However, Parliament was still in control of Britain and would not let him take his throne because after Charles I's execution, Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector of Britain from 1653-1658.\nThe King's escape.\nIn 1651, Charles II returned to Britain and fought Parliament at the Battle of Worcester. \nHe was defeated, but is supposed to have escaped by hiding in an oak tree. \nLater, he was forced to disguise himself as a servant. A young lady called Jane Lane helped him to escape, and he sailed to the Netherlands to re-join his supporters. He kept his own royal court there until 1660.\nThe Restoration.\nWhile Charles was in Holland, Britain was being ruled by Oliver Cromwell, an extraordinary man who had no title, but many followers. He was chosen as leader of the country by Parliament. When Cromwell died in 1658, his son Richard was chosen to be the next leader. \nRichard Cromwell was not the man his father had been. Charles II was asked to come back and rule Britain. In 1660, Charles II was brought back to Britain and took his throne. This was the English Restoration. \nMany of his enemies were punished for having executed his father and fought against him, but Richard Cromwell was allowed to go and live quietly away from London. \nCharles was popular and was called \"The Merry Monarch\" because he changed many laws that Cromwell had made and allowed people more freedom to enjoy themselves. \nHe liked to go to the theatre, play cards, and enjoy sports such as horse racing. \nSome people thought that a king should be more serious and not spend so much time and money on fun.\nThere were also some people who did not like King Charles II because of his religious beliefs. He had been brought up by his mother, who was Roman Catholic, while most people in the country were Protestant. \nHe married a princess from Portugal, Catherine of Braganza. They did not have any children, but Charles refused to divorce Catherine. Before he was married, he had several girlfriends and lovers, and even after he was married, he went on having lovers, who were called mistresses. \nThe most famous was an actress called Nell Gwyn. Several of Charles's lovers had babies. However, none of these children were allowed to follow Charles as king because they were bastards, meaning that they had been born to parents who were not married to each other.\nThe most popular of Charles II's children was James Scott. Charles gave him the title Duke of Monmouth. James's mother had been Charles's girlfriend when he was living in Holland, and some people said that they had been secretly married. If this had been true, then James would have been allowed to be king when Charles died. There were many who wanted this to happen, because they did not like the thought of Charles's younger brother being the next king. This brother, who was also called James, was a Roman Catholic and was not popular.\nCharles II died quite suddenly of an illness, and his son James, Duke of Monmouth, started a rebellion in the hope of becoming the next king. He was defeated by the royal army, which supported Charles's brother James. The Duke of Monmouth was executed by having his head chopped off, and Charles's brother became the next ruler, King James II.\nChildren.\nBy Marguerite or Margaret de Carteret\nBy Lucy Walter (c.1630\u20131658)\nBy Elizabeth Killigrew (1622\u20131680), daughter of Sir Robert Killigrew, married Francis Boyle, 1st Viscount Shannon in 1660\nBy Catherine Pegge\nBy Barbara Villiers Palmer (1641\u20131709), wife of Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine created Duchess of Cleveland in her own right\nbecame 2nd Duke of Cleveland (1709)\nlater Duke of Marlborough, who was another of Cleveland's many lovers, and was never acknowledged by Charles as his own daughter.\nBy Nell Gwyn (1650\u20131687)\nBy Louise Ren\u00e9e de Penancoet de K\u00e9rouaille (1649\u20131734), created Duchess of Portsmouth in her own right (1673)\nDuke of Lennox (1675) in Scotland.

They are also for urination (peeing), to remove waste products from the body. While all animals have sex organs, this article is about the sex organs of human beings.\nThe genitals are the main parts of the human body that make men and women different. Some parts of the genitals are outside the body, while other parts are inside. In a man, his external genitals are the penis and the scrotum (a bag that contains the testicles). Inside his body the testicles produce sperm and a substance called testosterone which makes a person grow into a man and to feel like a man. Other glands produce a fluid called semen. The part of a woman's genitals that is outside her body is called the vulva. Inside her body are the vagina, which holds the penis during sexual intercourse; the uterus (womb), in which a baby grows when the woman is pregnant; the ovaries, which produce ova (egg cells) and a substance called estrogen which makes a person grow into a woman and to feel like a woman; and the Fallopian tubes, which connect the ovaries to the uterus.\nMany human societies are prudish about genitals. This prudery has resulted in public indecency laws which makes it a crime for genitals to be left uncovered in public except in special places called nudist colonies.\nSummary.\nIf a man and a woman want to reproduce sexually, they have to engage in sexual intercourse. This involves placing the man's erect penis into the woman's vagina. The vagina rubs and puts pressure on the penis, which makes the man have an orgasm. During his orgasm the man ejaculates, and his semen flows into the woman. If a sperm in the semen reaches the woman's Fallopian tubes and fuses with an ovum, this causes the woman to become pregnant. A man and woman can also have sexual intercourse for pleasure, without wishing to have a baby. Men and women, and gay couples (two women or two men) can also use their sex organs in other ways for pleasure.\nDescription.\nThe sex organs are the parts of the body that allow sexual reproduction (the making of young) to take place. They are also for urination (peeing), to remove waste products from the body. All animals have some kind of sex organs. This article is about the sex organs of human beings. In humans, the sex organs are in the lower abdomen, at the part of the body where the legs join the torso.\nThe scientific name for the sex organs is \"genitalia\" or \"genitals\". They are also commonly called the reproductive organs. The genitals include both organs that can be seen on the outside of the body (the primary genitalia or external genitalia), as well as internal organs (the secondary genitalia or internal genitalia). Sometimes, however, the words \"genitalia\" or \"genitals\" are used to refer only to the external sex organs. The sex organs are informally referred to as the private parts or privates.\nMales and females have different sex organs. In fact, the genitals are the main parts of the human body that make men and women different.\nMen.\nA man's genitals are made up of many parts. The parts that can be seen on the outside of a man's body are his penis, which is shaped like a banana or a sausage; and his scrotum, which is a bag that hangs beneath the penis and contains the two testicles. A man's penis may be circumcised.\nInside a man's body, the testicles make tiny cells called sperm, which are needed for sexual reproduction. The testicles also make a hormone called testosterone. This is a chemical that makes a person grow into a man and feel like a man. The testicles are glands, which are special parts of the body that make chemicals. Other glands that make up the genitals are the prostate, seminal vesicles and bulbourethral glands (also called the Cowper's glands). Together, these glands make a white, sticky fluid called semen that sperm float in. Finally, a man's body contains ducts (tubes) such as the two vasa deferentia or ducta deferentia, which carry sperm out of the testicles; and the urethra, which carries semen through the penis and out of the body. The urethra also carries urine away from the bladder.\nIn reproduction the job of the penis is to carry sperm from the testicles into a woman's body so that a sperm can join together with the woman's ovum (egg cell) to form a new cell that will grow into a baby. The process of fusion of a sperm and an ovum is called fertilization. \nA man's penis is usually soft, quite short and hangs down. When a man becomes aroused (sexually excited), the inside of his penis fills with blood. This causes the penis to become bigger, thicker and harder and to stand upright, and is called having an erection. When a man has an erection, he is able to have sexual intercourse by putting his penis into a woman's vagina. During an erection, a valve stops urine from entering the urethra so that only semen flows along it. This is why it is very difficult for a man to urinate when he is having an erection.\nYoung boys can have erections, but their bodies do not start producing sperm until they have reached puberty. This usually happens when they are in their teens.\nWomen.\nThe part of a woman's genitals that is on the outside of her body is called the vulva. The main parts of the vulva are two sets of fleshy \"lips\" called the labia. The outer labia can be seen at the front of the woman's body. On an adult woman, they are generally covered with some hair. Between the outer labia are the inner labia which do not have hair and are very sensitive. At the front of the inner labia is the outside part of the clitoris which is covered by the clitoral hood. During sexual intercourse, the clitoris gives feelings of pleasure to the woman.\nMost of a woman's genitals are tucked inside her body. Behind the labia is a tube called the vagina, which cannot be seen on the outside of the body. (People often incorrectly use the word \"vagina\" to refer to the vulva.) When a man and a woman have sexual intercourse, the man's penis is placed into the woman's vagina. When a woman menstruates (has her menstrual period), blood and other fluid from the uterus pass out from her body through the vagina. If a woman uses a tampon (a specially-made wad of material) to absorb this fluid, she puts it into her vagina. The vagina is also called the birth canal, because when a pregnant woman has a baby, it passes through the vagina.\nLike a man, a woman has a tube called the urethra connecting the bladder to the vulva through which urine is removed from the body. The opening of the urethra is between the clitoris and the opening to the vagina.\nIn many women, the opening of the vagina is partly or completely blocked by a thin tissue called the hymen. Some women are born without a hymen. The hymen usually breaks when a woman has sexual intercourse for the first time, that may cause or not some bleeding depending particularly on each woman. In some cultures, a broken hymen is taken as a sign that a girl has had sex. However, a broken hymen is not a clear sign of sexual intercourse because other activities such as exercise can also cause the hymen to break. In some women, the hymen may remain unbroken even after sex.\nAt the top of the vagina is the cervix which is a ring of muscle separating the vagina from the uterus or womb. The cervix allows menstrual fluid to flow from the uterus into the vagina, and during sexual intercourse it allows semen from a man's penis to flow from the vagina into the uterus. The uterus is a very muscular and stretchy organ in which babies grow during pregnancy. When a woman is not pregnant, each month the lining of the uterus grows thicker, then breaks down, causing her to menstruate. Connected to the top of the uterus are two Fallopian tubes, on the left and right. These tubes join the uterus to the two ovaries. The ovaries produce ova, or egg cells, that are needed for reproduction. Each month, an ovum travels from one of the ovaries into a Fallopian tube. If, after the woman has had sexual intercourse with a man, the ovum fuses with a sperm and implants in the wall of the uterus, the woman will become pregnant. The ovaries also produce the female hormone estrogen which causes a person to grow into a woman and to feel like a woman.\nYoung girls do not start producing ova and menstruating until they have reached puberty. Like boys, this usually happens in their teens. Once a woman starts menstruating, she is capable of becoming pregnant.\nReproduction, sexual intercourse and masturbation.\nThe sex organs or genitals are used for sexual reproduction and for sexual intercourse. For sexual reproduction to happen, a man and a woman need to have sexual intercourse with each other. A man's penis becomes erect when he is aroused, for example when he sees a naked woman or is touched by her. When a woman is aroused, her clitoris and vulva also swell, and the inside of her vagina produces mucus, a substance that makes it slippery. To reproduce, the man places his penis inside the woman's vagina and moves it in and out (a movement called thrusting), while the woman moves her hips back and forth, or in a circular motion. The friction caused by this movement, together with the warmth and pressure of the vagina, causes the man to have pleasurable feelings in the penis. As intercourse continues, these feelings grow stronger and stronger until the man reaches a sexual climax called an orgasm. At this point, the man's penis spasms and then contracts strongly again and again to push semen through the urethra. The semen then ejaculates or shoots out from the end of the penis into the woman's vagina. The woman may also have an orgasm, which causes the vagina to tense up and relax repeatedly. Scientists are not sure why women have orgasms. Some believe that the orgasm helps the sperm in the man's semen to swim up the vagina into the cervix, so that it is more likely that a sperm cell will fuse with an egg cell. Others think that the female orgasm causes the vagina to grip the penis more tightly, which makes sex more exciting for the man and causes him to ejaculate more quickly or to produce more semen; or that it encourages a woman to have sex more often as it feels good. Both of these events would make pregnancy more likely to happen. After the man has ejaculated, the blood flows out of his penis and it becomes smaller and soft again.\nSometimes, a man and a woman may have sexual intercourse because it gives them pleasure, without wishing for the woman to become pregnant. They may try to stop fertilization from happening by using methods of contraception or birth control. Common methods of birth control include the man wearing a condom on his penis, and the woman taking birth control pills that stop her ovaries from releasing egg cells.\nApart from the man putting his penis into the woman's vagina, the sex organs can be used in other ways in sexual intercourse. The man and woman can rub each other's sex organs with their hands. They can use sex toys such as dildos or vibrators. They can also engage in oral sex. When a person uses his or her mouth, lips and tongue to touch a woman's clitoris and vulva, this is called cunnilingus. When a person uses his or her mouth, lips, and/or tongue to touch a man's penis, this is called fellatio. A man or a woman (using an strap-on dildo or harness) can also put the sexual organ into a person's anus, this is called anal sex.\nPeople who are gay or homosexual also use their genitals to have sexual intercourse with each other. Two women can rub each other's sex organs, put sex toys into them, or perform oral sex on each other. Two men can also rub each other's sex organs, or perform oral or anal sex on each other.\nWhen a man strokes his own penis or a woman rubs her clitoris and vulva in order to feel good or to reach orgasm, this is called masturbation.\nUrination.\nThe sex organs are also used for urination, which is one of the ways in which the body removes waste products. Both men and women have a bladder, which is an organ that stores urine. In a man, a thin tube called the urethra passes from his bladder right through his penis. In a woman, the urethra opens into the vulva. When a person urinates, urine flows from the bladder through the urethra and out of the body."}

Miniature and toy poodles are two sizes. The original poodle is the Standard poodle. Miniature and toy poodles are not related to Standard poodles. They don't share DNA. If the owner does praise it, it will start liking the owner even more, and doing things for the owner. Many people that own them show them at dog shows. Poodles were once used as hunting and sporting dogs, but now they are mostly pets. Poodles only have one coat, other dogs are known to have double coats. Poodles do not shed their fur as some dogs do, so they are good pets for people who are allergic to dogs. The hair of a poodle grows much quicker than that of a full-grown dog. One exciting aspect of the poodle hair is that it is capable of changing color. From research conducted, it is safe to say that the hair growth of a poodle is flanked by half an inch to one inch in 30 days. Just like every other dog hair, poodles also have issues with their hair. The biggest problem associated with poodle hair is that it has a habit of becoming thin and falling off its body. However, this happens mostly in female poodles whenever they are experiencing hormonal flow or heat.\nColors.\nPoodles are also popular because they come in many different colors and sizes. Their coats are most often white or black; but can be apricot, dark gray, called \"blue\"; and other colors. There are also some rare colors, such as chocolate brown, and brindle. In Japan, apricot color is the most liked.\nSizes.\nPoodles are bred in many different sizes. The four main sizes from largest to smallest are Standard, Miniature, Medium and Toy. There are also other sizes, like the very small Teacup, that are not official. This means that these other sizes cannot be part of professional dog shows.\nMilitary working dogs.\nPoodles have been used as working dogs in the military for several centuries. During World War II, it was thought that this breed of dog could become helpers during the war. So, poodles went through training by the United States Army for special tasks. In 1942, the poodle was one of 32 breeds officially ranked as war dogs by the Army.\nCuts.\nIt is the poodles main style to left hair of the chest and ankles in order to protect heart and joints from cold waters and cut others in order to reduce the resistance of the water. Now, poodles hair styles have more variations. In Japan, the \"teddy bear cut\" is most popular. This style lets the whole body have roundness like a teddy bear."}

Irish is a Celtic language. This means that Irish is similar to Scottish Gaelic, Breton, Cornish, Manx and Welsh.

One group is called the p-Celtic languages and the other is called the q-Celtic languages. Irish and Scottish Gaelic are q-Celtic languages and Welsh is a p-Celtic language. Irish has no \"yes\" or \"no\" words.\nThere were great poets who wrote in Irish. Their poems became the songs of the people. People told stories about the heroes of old times. Many of the poems were about them. \nQueen Elizabeth I of England tried to learn Irish and Christopher Nugent, 9th Baron of Delvin, gave her an Irish primer. She also asked her bishops to translate the Bible into Irish, an unsuccessful attempt to split the Catholic people from their clergy.\nUntil the 19th century, most people in Ireland spoke Irish but that changed after 1801 when Ireland joined the United Kingdom. Ireland\u2019s state schools then became part of the British system and had to teach or even allow only English. The Roman Catholic Church also began to discourage Irish as did Nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell, although an Irish-speaker himself, saying that most job opportunities were in the English-speaking United States and wider British Empire.\nToday, Irish is the first official language of the Republic of Ireland but in practice English still has a dominant position in government. It is not spoken by most Irish people outside the Gaeltacht in day-to-day life, although many speak it when among friends or family.

The program was named after the Greek god Apollo. The goal was to send a human to explore the Moon and bring him home to earth safely. It was started by US President John F. Kennedy in 1961. He said:\nOne reason the program started was that the Soviet Union was the first country to send a person into outer space. Since this was during the Cold War, many in the US thought that the US needed to stay ahead of the USSR in space exploration.\nThe Apollo spacecraft was made up of a Command and Service Module, and a Lunar Module. The Command Module was a space capsule. The Lunar Module was a lander. These spacecraft docked on the way to the Moon. Mercury and Gemini spaceships were very small and cramped, but the Apollo capsule was much bigger. Astronauts could move around and not have to stay in their seats. The Lunar Lander was also big on the inside. The only part of the Apollo spacecraft to come back to Earth was the capsule, the Lunar Module would crash on the moon.\nThe Apollo program ended in 1975. After that, NASA began to work on the Space Shuttle program, the International Space Station, and many unmanned space exploration projects.\nThere was a movie made about the problems that happened on the Apollo 13 mission.\nMissions.\nIn September\u00a01967, Owen Maynard of the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas proposed a series of Apollo missions that would lead to landing a person on the Moon. There were seven types of mission, each testing a specific set of parts and tasks. Each step would need to be completed successfully before the next mission type could begin. These were:\nThe first manned Lunar Module, LM-3, was not ready for the December 1968 launch date of Apollo 8. The mission flew as a lunar orbital mission, using just the CSM. The E mission was canceled.\nThe first landing would be followed by more advanced lunar missions:\nApollo flights.\nThe Apollo flights were carried into space by the Saturn I and V rockets."}

{"id": "24512", "revid": "7873413", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24512", "title": "NASA", "text": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government that deals with space exploration and aeronautics, the operating and designing of planes. NASA has had many successful missions, for example the ISS, and Apollo 11, which put the first man on the Moon in 1969. NASA was started on July 29, 1958. NASA's motto is: \"For the Benefit of All\". The current Administrator of NASA is Bill Nelson since April 2021.\nFounding and the Sputnik crisis.\nNASA was preceded by the \"HouseNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics\" (NACA). NACA was a US federal agency founded on March 3, 1915 to undertake, promote, and institutionalize aeronautical research. On October 1, 1958 the agency was dissolved, and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA was founded to compete with the Soviet Union in the space race. In the 1950s and 1960s there was a space race between the US and the Soviet Union - now called Russia. The Soviets started first launching Sputnik 1, the first object made by people to go into orbit, in October 1957. The Americans were worried by this. It caused a crisis known as the Sputnik Crisis as the Americans feared the Russians might start building weapons in space. This all happened at a time called the Cold War when the USA and the Soviet Union were always very close to war.\nSpace flight programs.\nProject Mercury (1958\u20131963).\nOriginally NASA was very small with only four laboratories and around eighty people working there. German engineers and scientists led by Wernher von Braun helped them build rockets. They had helped build the V-2 missile in Germany during World War II and the Redstone missile for the US Army afterwards. Their Army missile laboratory was transferred to NASA.\nIn 1960 they set up the Mercury project. The Mercury Project space missions were designed by NASA, mostly to test if humans could survive in space. After they proved it was possible for people to live in space they moved on.\nOn May 15th 1961 astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space. Less than a year later, John Glenn became the first American to orbit or circle the Earth. He did so in a spacecraft called Friendship 7. Once the Mercury Project proved that humans could live in space, the Gemini Project was started. Less than a year after it began, the Apollo Program also began.\nProject Gemini (1961\u20131966).\nAfter the success of Mercury, NASA realized it had to start planning for its missions to the Moon. The Gemini spacecraft was built for two men. It was still small and cramped similar to the Mercury capsule, but allowed for more freedom of movement. Project Gemini proved that two spacecraft could rendezvous (meet and dock) in space. Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon, was also on the first Gemini flight to dock with another spacecraft in outer space. The Gemini spacecraft did not dock with another spacecraft with people in it. Instead, it docked with a rocket called \"Agena target vehicle\". The last few Gemini missions were science experiments and spacewalks designed to prepare for the Apollo Program, which would land human beings on the Moon.\nApollo program (1961\u20131972).\nThe Apollo program was started by President John F Kennedy in the 1960s. The program was made of 16 missions designed to send a man to the Moon and return him safely back to Earth. The first Apollo mission, Apollo 1, ended in disaster when a fire in the command module killed all the astronauts on board. The Apollo 8 and 10 missions went to the moon. They tested equipment and took photos but did not land.\nThe project's main success came in 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon as part of Apollo 11. The mission was a big success for NASA and over six million people watched it worldwide. After Apollo 11, six more Apollo flights went to the moon. Five of them landed. The one that did not land, Apollo 13, had to abort its mission when an oxygen tank exploded in the spaceship. Apollo 17 was the last mission to land on the Moon.\nSkylab (1965\u20131979).\nAfter Congress stopped the Moon landings, NASA needed a new direction. Using a leftover Saturn V rocket, the giant rocket that sent men to the Moon, they created a space station that orbited above the Earth. This space station was called Skylab. Skylab was very big on the inside, even bigger than a small house. Skylab was visited by Apollo spacecrafts. There were three missions to Skylab. Each of them carried important experiments. The last crewed mission, Skylab 4, spent 84\u00a0days, 1\u00a0hour, 15\u00a0minutes, 30\u00a0seconds, longer than any space mission had spent until 1977. Skylab broke up in the atmosphere in 1979.\nApollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project (1972\u20131975).\nDuring the Space Race, the Soviets had designed their own spacecraft to fly to the Moon. Their spacecraft was called Soyuz. The Soviets never landed on the Moon, they had too many problems. Instead, they started creating small space stations. The Soyuz spacecraft is what they used to go to these space stations. US and Soviet Union were part of the Cold War. In order to make peace between Soviet Union and US, they decided they would dock an Apollo spacecraft to a Soyuz spacecraft in space. After docking, the crews performed experiments and learned about each other's cultures. Apollo\u2013Soyuz was the last flight of the Apollo spacecraft. It has never been used since, and as of 2020, there are no plans for it to be used again.\nSpace Shuttle program (1972\u20132011).\nIn the 1980s and 1990s NASA began to concentrate on building Space Shuttles. Four Shuttles were built in 1985. The first to launch was the Space Shuttle Columbia in April 12, 1981. At this time the public began to lose interest in the space program and NASA faced budget cuts. They had planned for the Space Shuttles to cost less as they could be used more than once. But eventually it turned out the Space Shuttles were more expensive as building them in the first place cost more money than normal. There were further problems for NASA after the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated in flight in 1986, killing all seven of its astronauts. The incident is known as the Challenger Disaster.\nThe Challenger Disaster forced NASA to think about the way they worked. The entire Space Shuttle fleet was suspended for a year. After that, NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Its most famous photo was the Hubble Deep Field.\nIn 2011, NASA shut down the Space Shuttle program. They were more expensive to use than other launch vehicles.\nInternational Space Station (1993\u2013present).\nIn the early 1980s, NASA planned Space Station Freedom as a counterpart to the Soviet Salyut and Mir space stations. It never left the drawing board and, with the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War, it was cancelled. The end of the Space Race prompted the U.S. administration officials to start negotiations with international partners Europe, Russia, Japan and Canada in the early 1990s in order to build the International Space Station. This project was first announced in 1993 and was called Space Station Alpha. It was planned to combine the proposed space stations of all participating space agencies: NASA's Space Station Freedom, Russia's Mir-2 (the successor to the Mir Space Station, the core of which is now Zvezda) and ESA's Columbus that was planned to be a stand-alone spacelab.\nCuriosity rover (2011\u2013present).\n\"Curiosity\" is a car-sized rover. It was made to explore the crater Gale on Mars. \"Curiosity\" was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011, at 15:02\u00a0UTC and landed on Aeolis Palus inside Gale on Mars on August 6, 2012, 05:17\u00a0UTC. The Bradbury Landing site was less than from where the rover landed after a journey. The goals of the rover include an investigation of the Martian climate and geology.\nNASA's future.\nNASA is continuing operations include missions to the planets Mars, Saturn and Pluto. Missions to Jupiter are also planned for the near future. The New Horizons spacecraft flew past Jupiter in February 2007, studying some of the planet's moons. On July 14, 2015 the craft flew by Pluto, took high resolution pictures of the planet's surface and analysed the chemical properties of its atmosphere.\nNASA announced in 2004 that they plan to have a permanent Moon base by 2020. A senior NASA administrator also stated in 2007 that NASA aims \"to put a man on Mars by 2037\".\nHowever, in early 2010, President Barack Obama cancelled the Constellation project that was aiming to have humans return to the moon's surface by 2020. He said the project was \"behind schedule and lacking in innovation\". At the same time he cut back the amount of money NASA will be getting from the government in 2011.\nWhen President Barack Obama did this, he also worked with NASA to create the Space Launch System. This, with commercial launch vehicles (launch vehicles that are not owned by NASA), will take humans to the Moon and Mars.\nNASA Missions.\nNASA has launched over 500 missions in its 50-year history. Over 150 missions had humans on board. Such \"manned\" missions are the most expensive and make the most news but the majority of launches are for space exploration, science, and other purposes that do not need people. NASA spacecraft such as Cassini-Huygens and the Voyager program have visited every planet in the Solar System. Four NASA spacecraft have left the Solar System, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11. As of 2013 Voyager 1 is around 18,800,000,000 (18.8 billion) kilometers away from Earth."}

People who believe in Advaita believe that their soul is not different from Brahman. The most famous Hindu philosopher who taught about Advaita Vedanta was Adi Shankara who lived in India more than a thousand years ago. \nHistory.\nAdi Shankara learned the sacred texts of Hinduism, like Vedas and Upanishads under his teacher Govinda Bhagavadpada and later wrote extensive commentaries of Hindu sacred texts called Upanishads. In these commentaries, he proposed the theory of Advaita, saying that the Upanishad actually teach that the individual soul (called Atman) is not different from Ultimate Reality (called Brahman). He also taught that there is only one essential principle called Brahman and everything else is a kind of expression of that one Brahman. Because of this theory of one being, his teachings became popular as the \"Advaita\" (\"a\" = not, \"dvaita\" = two, means no-two or non-dual). The way he said this to people was \"Atman is Brahman.\"\nAdi Shankara was smart and knew that people would wonder how he could say such an odd thing. He realized that many people would ask him, \"If a person's soul is really one with Ultimate all along, then what makes a person feel so separate from Ultimate?\" His answer to this was that we are ignorant of our real self being Ultimate because we see through a kind of filter\u2014like looking through a dirty piece of glass\u2014and he called this filter we look through, \"maya\", which means \"illusion\" in Sanskrit. \nShankara said that our ignorance makes us feel very separate from Ultimate, and even from everything around us. Shankara suggested that the best way people can find the truth is for them to try to clear their thinking of all ignorant thoughts, be very good, and think very hard about who they really are. He said that if a person did all these things he would realize that Brahman was himself all along.\nThis is a very similar idea to other religions at their esoteric core. For instance within Islam there is an idea of annihilation within the divine, and (Unity of Existence)"}

It was built between 447 BC and 432 BC during the reign of Pericles. It is considered one of ancient Greece's greatest architecture accomplishments. \nThe building was constructed using limestone foundations and 22,000 tons of marble. The building was designed by the architects Ictinus and Callicrates. It has 46 Doric columns which support the roof, with 8 across the front and back, and 17 on each side. \nIn 1687 a gunpowder explosion damaged the building. Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin took some of the sculptures, now called the Elgin Marbles, from the Parthenon in 1759. They have been on display in the British Museum since 1816."}

They are carnivorous of small and medium-sized prey. To hunt, they can run at speeds of 16 km/h (10 mph). This not fast, but they have great endurance, so can run for a long time. Jackals are \"opportunistic omnivores\", which will take on larger animals if they need to. They are predators of small to medium-sized animals and proficient scavengers.\nJackals are monogamous (each male lives with only one female). A pair defends its territory from other pairs: they mark the territory with urine and feces. The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults who live with their parents until they have their own territory. Sometimes, jackals join small packs, for example to hunt a big animal, but normally they hunt alone or as a pair.\nJackals are not a clade. They have several times developed from canid ancestors. However, they are closely related. It could be put this way: jackals are dogs which have a certain similar appearance and behaviour. They all have 78 chromosomes.\nThere are three species of jackals:\nA canid from Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Ethiopian wolf (\"Canis simensis\"), is sometimes called Simien jackal, but it is really a wolf. The Ethiopian wolf is one of the rarest and most endangered of all canids."}

Animals that belong to Felidae are called \"felids\".\nThe family is of quite recent origin: the first fossils are from the Oligocene, 25 million years ago (mya). There are 41 living species, including the domestic cat, and they are monophyletic: all descended from the same ancestor.\nCharacteristics.\nFelids tend to have lithe and flexible bodies with muscular limbs. In most species, the tail is a third or a half the length of the body, with some exceptions (the bobcat and margay). The limbs are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. The paws have three soft toe pads and retractible claws (usually). The tongue of felids is covered with horny papillae, which rasp meat from prey and aid in grooming.\nClassification.\nThe Felidae has three subfamilies:\nMore examples of felines are the big cats \u2013 the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, clouded leopard, puma, and cheetah - and other wild cats, for example the lynx, caracal, and bobcat. All felines, also the small pet cat, are predators that can hunt many animals.\nEvolution.\nThe felids evolved in Asia and spread across continents by crossing land bridges. DNA sequence analysis shows that ancient cats evolved into eight main lines. There were at least 10 migrations (in both directions) from continent to continent via the Bering land bridge and Isthmus of Panama. The \"Panthera\" genus is the oldest and the \"Felis\" genus is the youngest. 60 percent of the modern species of cats developed within the last million years.\nThe felids' closest relatives are the linsangs, and at one remove the group of civets, hyenas, mongooses, and Madagascar carnivores, with whom they share the Suborder Feliformia. All felid species share a genetic anomaly that prevents them from tasting sweetness.\nGenetic classification.\nGenetic research has provided a basis for a more concise classification for the living members of the cat family based on genotypical groupings. Specifically, eight genetic lineages have been identified:\nThe last four lineages (5, 6, 7, 8) are more related to each other than to any of the first four (1, 2, 3, 4), and so form a clade within the Felinae subfamily of family Felidae."}

He was also a well-known dissident and human rights activist. Sakharov was an advocate of nuclear disarmament and civil liberties and reforms in the Soviet Union.\nLife.\nSakharov was a very clever scientist. He graduated from college during World War II but was kept out of the Red Army to do scientific research for the government. Sakharov helped the Soviets develop the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s. But he also made many peaceful uses of nuclear power.\nThe bomb he had helped make started Sakharov to be a dissident. He argued with Nikita Khrushchev against unneeded nuclear tests. He was afraid that these tests put people's lives and healths in danger without need. He began asking, too, for more freedom of speech. The government removed him from his secret work and his special job as a scientist. Sakharov began to see what unhappy lives most Soviet citizens led.\nPersecution only made him speak out more. He asked for more freedom of religion and defended others who had spoken out and been put into jail. The secret police began to watch him and to make files of information against him. After Sakharov criticized activities of the USSR's Arab allies, Arab terrorists came to his apartment and held him, his wife, and his stepson hostage for an hour. \"Do you want to kill us?\" cried Sakharov's wife. \"We can do worse things than kill you,\" they replied. After the terrorists left without doing anything, Sakharov tried to tell the police about it. The police did not really care.\nThe only thing that protected Sakharov was many people knew about him outside the Soviet Union. The Communists were afraid that if something happened to him, it would give the world a bad image of the USSR. But when Sakharov criticized the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, they became very angry and took him to the city of Gorky. There he was watched by the police outside his apartment. He tried to go on a hunger strike, not eating anything. The Soviet Union was afraid he might die, so they force-fed him (forcing him to eat).\nSakharov kept on asking for \"glasnost\" (openness). In 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, who agreed with Sakharov and thought there should be \"glasnost\", let the dissident scientist return home.

It continued expanding under the emperor Claudius (43). The reforms introduced by Augustus during his long reign stabilized the empire. Later in the century the Julio-Claudian Dynasty, which had been founded by Augustus came to an end with the death of Nero in 68. There followed the famous Year of Four Emperors, a brief period of civil war and instability, which was finally brought to an end by Vespasian, 9th Roman emperor, and founder of the Flavian Dynasty.\nChina continued to be dominated by the Han Dynasty, despite a 14-year interruption by the Xin dynasty under Wang Mang. Han rule was restored in 23. Wang Mang's rule represents the watershed between the Western/Former Han and the Eastern/Later Han. The capital was also moved from Chang'an to Luoyang.\nInventions, discoveries, introductions.\nChristianity.\nAccording to the New Testament, during the reign of Tiberius, Jesus, a Jewish religious leader from Galilee, was crucified in Jerusalem on the charge of blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God. But \"God raised him from the dead\" three days later, see Resurrection of Jesus. Over the next few decades his followers, following the Great Commission, including the apostle Paul, carried his message throughout the Greek-speaking regions of Asia Minor, eventually introducing it to Rome itself. Roman rulers began to persecute the new sect almost immediately (the emperor Nero accused the Christians of starting the fires that destroyed much of Rome in 64 AD), and would continue to do so for centuries, sometimes vigorously, and other times passively. Christian tradition records that all of Christ's apostles except John the Evangelist suffered martyrdom.\nIn the 4th century, Christianity was eventually taken up by the emperor Constantine. One of his successors Julian the Apostate renounced it for paganism and again persecuted the Church. However, by the end of the 4th century, Emperor Theodosius I proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire.\nDecades and years.\nNote: years before or after the 1st century are in \"italics\"."}

The four species are in Eurasia, Spain, Canada and America, and do not overlap much.\nAppearance.\n\"Lynx\" have short tails, and usually some hair on the ears. They have large paws (feet) padded for walking on snow, and long whiskers on the face. The color of the body is from light brown to grey and is sometimes marked with dark brown spots, especially on the legs. They weigh about 5\u00a0kg or about 11 pounds (approximately the size of a large domestic cat) and can weigh up to about 30\u00a0kg (66 pounds). They are between 70 and 150 cm long, with a relative short tail - 5-25 cm. They live for about 20 years.\n\"Lynx\" are similar to a regular house cat, but larger. They have a powerful body on short, furry legs attached to hefty feet, and a bobbed, black-tipped tail. The fur is spotted and yellowish-brown to grey. It has a collar of fur around the face, giving a triangular shape. They also have long black ear tufts.\nHabitat.\n\"Lynx\" live in the high altitude forests with many shrubs, reeds and grass. They hunt only on the ground, but can climb trees and swim.\nThey can be found in the some places in northern Scandinavia, in North America and also in the Himalayas. Since the 1990s people try to move part of the population of the Eurasian lynx to Germany. They can also be found in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest (northeastern Poland), and southern Spain.\nThe Colorado Division of Wildlife tried to move other wild \"Lynx\" populations from Canada back to the United States.\nBehaviour.\n\"Lynx\" are usually solitary, although a small group may travel and hunt together occasionally. Mating takes place in the late winter and once a year the female gives birth to between two and four kittens. The young stay with the mother for one more winter, a total of around nine months, before moving out to live on their own as young adults.\n\"Lynx\" make their dens in crevices or under ledges. They feed on a wide range of animals from white-tailed deer, reindeer, roe deer, small red deer, and chamois, to smaller, more usual prey: snowshoe hares, fish, foxes, sheep, squirrels, mice, turkeys and other birds, and goats. They also eat ptarmigans,voles, and grouse.\nConservation.\nThe Iberian lynx is the most endangered feline in the world. There are only two populations (together, 300 animals), in the southern Spain.\nHunting lynxes is illegal in many countries."}

The famous game designer,\u00a0Shigeru Miyamoto, made him. Luigi is the younger but\u00a0taller\u00a0fraternal twin\u00a0brother\u00a0of the Nintendo mascot, Mario. He is in many games all over the\u00a0\"Mario\"\u00a0series, almost always as an\u00a0assistant\u00a0to his brother Mario.\nThe first game Luigi was in was\u00a0\"Mario Bros. (Game and Watch)\" (1983) as a character seen working in a factory. He later appeared playable in the 1983 arcade game \"Mario Bros\" and was played by the second character. It was also done in\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros.\",\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 3\",\u00a0\"Super Mario World\", and other games. The first game where he was present as the first character was\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\". In the Mario series, he is usually not the main character. However, he has his own games where is the main character, like Luigi's Mansion and Mario is Missing!. He also appears in many spin-offs, such as Mario Kart, Mario Party and the Super Smash Bros. series. Luigi has also been in every show of the three\u00a0DiC\u00a0TV series based on the Nintendo Entertainment System\u00a0and\u00a0Super Nintendo Entertainment System\u00a0games.\nAt first he was made as a\u00a0palette swap\u00a0of Mario with a green color instead of red. Later in the series, he became his own character with his own personality and abilities. As his part in the\u00a0\"Mario\"\u00a0series progressed, Luigi became taller and thinner than his brother.\nNintendo called 2013 \"The Year of Luigi\" to mark the thirty years of the existence of the character. Similarly, games being released in 2013 bring attention to Luigi, such as ,\u00a0\"\",\u00a0\"Dr. Luigi\", and the level pack\u00a0\"New Super Luigi U\"\u00a0for\u00a0\"New Super Mario Bros. U\". In\u00a0\"Super Mario 3D World\" a Luigi version of\u00a0\"Mario Bros.\"\u00a0called\u00a0\"Luigi Bros.\" can be unlocked.\nConcept and creation.\nThe events leading to the creation of Luigi began in 1982, during the making of \"Donkey Kong\". The Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (who used to be \"Jumpman\") hoping that he would be able to present the character in many different pars in future games. Miyamoto had been given ideas by the game\u00a0\"Joust\"\u00a0to create a game where two players can play at the same time. This was the cause of his development of the game\u00a0\"Mario Bros.\"\u00a0in 1983, with Luigi as the brother of Mario and the second playable character. The name Luigi is said to have been inspired by a pizza business near the head office of Nintendo of America in\u00a0Redmond, Washington, called \"Mario &amp; Luigi's\". Miyamoto noticed that the word\u00a0\"ruiji\"\u00a0means \"similar\" in the Japanese language, and that Luigi was designed to have the same size, shape and gameplay of Mario.\nAt first in\u00a0\"Donkey Kong\", Mario was a carpenter. In\u00a0\"Mario Bros.\", Mario and Luigi\u00a0were designed as\u00a0Italian\u00a0plumbers by Miyamoto, on the suggestion of a partner. Software limits at the time\u2014almost the same as those that gave\u00a0Mario\u00a0his special look in\u00a0\"Donkey Kong\"\u2014meant the first appearance of Luigi was limited to a simple\u00a0palette swap\u00a0of Mario designed to be the second player. The characters were in every way the same, other than their colors.\u00a0The green color for Luigi would last as one of his physical characteristics in future releases.\nAfter the success of\u00a0\"Mario Bros.\", Luigi was presented to a wider market in 1985 with the release of the console game\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. \"Once again his part was limited to a palette swap of Mario, acting as the second-player in almost the same way as\u00a0\"Mario Bros. \"The Japan-only form of\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00a0in 1986 (released in the west as\u00a0\" \"in the future) marked the start of the development of Luigi becoming a separate character. As with his last appearances, Luigi was still a palette swap of Mario. However, his moves were not the same. Luigi could now jump high up and a great distance more than his brother, at the cost of motion reaction and exactness.\nWhile this form of\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00a0was released in Japan, it was thought to be too hard for the American public at the time. In 1988, as a result, an alternative release was developed to be good enough as\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00a0for western players (and in the future released in Japan as\u00a0\"Super Mario USA\"). This would play a key part in forming the current look of Luigi. The game was a conversion of\u00a0', with the art changed to be characters and places from the\u00a0\"Mario\"\u00a0series. In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who could jump the highest, was good enough for the model for Luigi. This caused his taller, thinner look, combined with his Mario-design outfit and green color. There were appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario before - for example, in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game\u00a0'\u00a0and before that, in a very limited 1986 anime\u00a0\"\" (though in the anime he had a yellow shirt and blue overalls). Licensed art for\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 3\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Super Mario World \"presents Luigi with this new look. Nintendo of Japan would not change his art differences to his look within the game until the 1992 game\u00a0\"Super Mario Kart\". The appearance of Luigi from the\u00a0\"Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic\" version of\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\"\u00a0has been used ever since, even for games made again in which he was a palette swap to start with.\nVoice.\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's has changed over the years. In \"Mario Kart 64\", which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters had two different voices in relation to the region of the game. North American and European forms present a deep voice for Luigi, by Charles Martinet, who also voices Mario, Wario, Waluigi, and Toadsworth. The Japanese form uses a high, falsetto voice, by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All forms of \"Mario Party\" present the high-pitched clips of Bardakoff from \"Mario Kart 64\". Luigi kept this higher voice in \"Mario Party 2\". In \"Mario Golf\", \"Mario Tennis\", and \"Mario Party 3\" his voice returned to normal. Since then, in all games but ' and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", Luigi has always had a medium-pitched voice. In ', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese \"Mario Kart 64\". In \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", Luigi's voice is based on Mario's voice (with clips taken from \"Super Mario 64\"), with a higher pitch. In \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", he has his own voice clips instead of voice clips taken from Mario.\nPlayable appearances.\nPlayable only in two-player:\nPlayable in one-player or two-player:"}
{"id": "24700", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24700", "title": "RAID", "text": "RAID is an acronym that stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks or Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID is a term used in computing. With RAID, several hard disks are made into one logical disk. There are different ways this can be done. Each of the methods that puts the hard disks together has some benefits and drawbacks over using the drives as single disks, independent of each other. The main reasons why RAID is used are:\nIt is not possible to achieve all of these goals at the same time, so choices need to be made.\nThere are also some bad things:\nMost of the work on RAID is based on a paper written in 1988.\nCompanies have used RAID systems to store their data since the technology was made. There are different ways in which RAID systems can be made. Since its discovery, the cost of building a RAID system has come down a lot. For this reason, even some computers and appliances that are used at home have some RAID functions. Such systems can be used to store music or movies, for example.\nIntroduction.\nDifference between physical Disks and logical disks.\nA hard disk is a part of a computer. Normal hard disks use magnetism to store information. When hard disks are used, they are available to the operating system. In Microsoft Windows, each hard disk will get a drive letter (starting with C:, A: or B: are reserved for floppy drives). Unix and Linux-like operating systems have a single-rooted directory tree. This means that people who use the computers sometimes do not know where the information is stored.(To be fair, a lot of Windows users don't know where their data is stored as well.)\nIn computing, the hard disks (which are hardware, and can be touched) are sometimes called \"physical drives\" or \"physical disks\". What the operating system shows the user is sometimes called \"logical disk\". A physical drive can be split into different sections, called disk partitions. Usually, each disk partition contains one file system. The operating system will show each partition like a logical disk.\nTherefore, to the user, both the setup with many physical disks and the setup with many logical disks will look the same. The user cannot decide if a \"logical disk\" is the same as a physical disk, or if it simply is a part of the disk. Storage Area Networks (SANs) completely change this view. All that is visible of a SAN is a number of logical disks.\nReading and writing data.\nIn the computer, data is organised in the form of bits and bytes. In most systems, 8 bits make up a byte. Computer memory uses electricity to store the data, hard disks use magnetism. Therefore, when data is \"written\" on a disk, the electric signal is converted into a magnetic one. When data is read from disk, the conversion is done in the other direction: An electrical signal is made from the polarity of a magnetic field.\nWhat is RAID?\nA RAID array joins two or more hard disks so that they make a logical disk. There are different reasons why this is done. The most common ones are:\nRAID is done by using special hardware or software on the computer. The joined hard disks will then look like one hard disk to the user. Most RAID levels increase the redundancy. This means that they store the data more often, or they store information on how to reconstruct the data. This allows for a number of disks to fail without the data being lost. When the failed disk is replaced, the data it should contain will be copied or rebuilt from the other disks of the system. This can take a long time. The time it takes depends on different factors, like the size of the array.\nWhy use RAID?\nOne of the reasons why many companies are using RAID is that the data in the array can simply be used. Those using the data need not be aware they are using RAID at all. When a failure occurred and the array is recovering, access to the data will be slower. Accessing the data during this time will also slow down the recovery process, but this is still much faster than not being able to work with the data at all.\nDepending on the RAID level however, disks may not fail while the new disk is being prepared for use. A disk failing at that time will result in losing all the data in the array.\nThe different ways to join disks are called \"RAID levels\". A bigger number for the level is not necessarily better. Different RAID levels have different purposes. Some RAID levels need special disks and special controllers.\nHistory.\nIn 1978, a man called Norman Ken Ouchi, who worked at IBM, made a suggestion describing the plans for what would later become RAID 5. The plans also described something similar to RAID 1, as well as the protection of a part of RAID 4.\nWorkers at the University of Berkeley helped to plan out research in 1987. They were trying to make it possible for RAID technology to recognize two hard drives instead of one. They found that when RAID technology had two hard drives, it had much better storage than with only one hard drive. However, it crashed much more often.\nIn 1988, the different types of RAID (1 to 5), were written about by David Patterson, Garth Gibson and Randy Katz in their article, called \"A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)\". This article was the first to call the new technology RAID and the name became official.\nBasic concepts used by RAID systems.\nRAID uses a few basic ideas, which were described in the article \"RAID: High-Performance, Reliable Secondary Storage\" by Peter Chen and others, published in 1994.\nCaching.\nCaching is a technology that also has its uses in RAID systems. There are different kinds of caches that are used in RAID systems:\nIn modern systems, a write request is shown as done when the data has been written to the cache. This does not mean that the data has been written to the disk. Requests from the cache are not necessarily handled in the same order that they were written to the cache. This makes it possible that, if the system fails, sometimes some data has not been written to the disk involved. For this reason, many systems have a cache that is backed by a battery.\nMirroring: More than one copy of the data.\nWhen talking about a mirror, this is a very simple idea. Instead of the data being in only one place, there are several copies of the data. These copies usually are on different hard disks (or disk partitions). If there are two copies, one of them can fail without the data being affected (as it still is on the other copy). Mirroring can also give a boost when reading data. It will always be taken from the fastest disk that responds. Writing data is slower though, because all disks need to be updated.\nStriping: Part of the data is on another disk.\nWith striping, the data is split into different parts. These parts then end up on different disks (or disk partitions). This means that writing data is faster, as it can be done in parallel. This does not mean that there will not be faults, as each block of data is only found on one disk.\nError correction and faults.\nIt is possible to calculate different kinds of checksums. Some methods of calculating checksums allow finding a mistake. Most RAID levels that use redundancy can do this. Some methods are more difficult to do, but they allow to not only detect the error, but to fix it.\nHot spares: using more disks than needed.\nMany of the ways to have RAID support something is called a \"hot spare\". A hot spare is an empty disk that is not used in normal operation. When a disk fails, data can directly be copied onto the hot spare disk. That way, the failed disk needs to be replaced by a new empty drive to become the hot spare.\nStripe size and chunk size: spreading the data over several disks.\nRAID works by spreading the data over several disks. Two of the terms often used in this context are \"stripe size\" and \"chunk size\".\nThe \"chunk size\" is the smallest data block that is written to a single disk of the array. The \"stripe size\" is the size of a block of data that will be spread over all disks. That way, with four disks, and a stripe size of 64 kilobytes (kB), 16 kB will be written to each disk. The chunk size in this example is therefore 16 kB. Making the stripe size bigger will mean a faster data transfer rate, but also a bigger maximum latency. In this case, this is the time needed to get a block of data.\nPutting disk together: JBOD, concatenation or spanning.\nMany controllers (and also software) can put disks together in the following way: Take the first disk, till it ends, then they take the second, and so on. In that way, several smaller disks look like a larger one. This is not really RAID, as there is no redundancy. Also, spanning can combine disks where RAID 0 cannot do anything. Generally, this is called \"just a bunch of disks\" (JBOD).\nThis is like a distant relative of RAID because the logical drive is made of different physical drives. Concatenation is sometimes used to turn several small drives into one larger useful drive. This can not be done with RAID 0. For example, JBOD could combine 3 GB, 15 GB, 5.5 GB, and 12 GB drives into a logical drive at 35.5 GB, which is often more useful than the drives alone.\nIn the diagram to the right, data are concatenated from the end of disk 0 (block A63) to the beginning of disk 1 (block A64); end of disk 1 (block A91) to the beginning of disk 2 (block A92).\nIf RAID 0 were used, then disk 0 and disk 2 would be truncated to 28 blocks, the size of the smallest disk in the array (disk 1) for a total size of 84 blocks.\nSome RAID controllers use JBOD to talk about working on drives without RAID features. Each drive shows up separately in the operating system. This JBOD is not the same as concatenation.\nMany Linux systems use the terms \"linear mode\" or \"append mode\". The Mac OS X 10.4 implementation \u2014 called a \"Concatenated Disk Set\" \u2014 does not leave the user with any usable data on the remaining drives if one drive fails in a concatenated disk set, although the disks otherwise operate as described above.\nConcatenation is one of the uses of the Logical Volume Manager in Linux. It can be used to create virtual drives.\nDrive Clone.\nMost modern hard disks have a standard called Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T). SMART allows to monitor certain things on a hard disk drive. Certain controllers allow to replace a single hard disk even before it fails, for example because S.M.A.R.T or another disk test reports too many correctable errors. To do this, the controller will copy all the data onto a hot spare drive. After this, the disk can be replaced by another (which will simply become the new hot spare).\nDifferent setups.\nThe setup of the disks and how they use the techniques above affects the performance and reliability of the system. When more disks are used, one of the disks is more likely to fail. Because of this, mechanisms have to be built to be able to find and fix errors. This makes the whole system more reliable, as it is able to survive and repair the failure.\nBasics: simple RAID levels.\nRAID levels in common use.\nRAID 0 \"striping\".\nRAID 0 is not really RAID because it is not redundant. With RAID 0, disks are simply put together to make a large disk. This is called \"striping\". When one disk fails, the whole array fails. Therefore, RAID 0 is rarely used for important data, but reading and writing data from the disk can be faster with striping because each disk reads part of the file at the same time.\nWith RAID 0, disk blocks that come after one another are usually placed on different disks. For this reason, all disks used by a RAID 0 should be the same size.\nRAID 0 is often used for Swapspace on Linux or Unix-like operating systems.\nRAID 1 \"mirroring\".\nWith RAID 1, two disks are put together. Both hold the same data, one is \"mirroring\" the other. This is easy, fast configuration whether implemented with a hardware controller or by software.\nRAID 5 \"striping with distributed parity\".\nRAID Level 5 is what is probably used most of the time. At least three hard disks are needed to build a RAID 5 storage array. Each block of data will be stored in three different places. Two of these places will store the block as it is, the third will store a checksum. This checksum is a special case of a Reed-Solomon code that only uses bitwise addition. Usually, it is calculated using the XOR method. Since this method is symmetric, one lost data block can be rebuilt from the other data block and the checksum. For each block, a different disk will hold the parity block which holds the checksum. This is done to increase redundancy. Any disk can fail. Overall, there will be one disk holding the checksums, so the total usable capacity will be that of all disks except for one. The size of the resulting logical disk will be the size of all disks together, except for one disk which holds parity information.\nOf course this is slower than RAID level 1, since on every write, all disks need to be read to calculate and update the parity information. The read performance of RAID 5 is almost as good as RAID 0 for the same number of disks. Except for the parity blocks, the distribution of data over the drives follows the same pattern as RAID 0. The reason RAID 5 is slightly slower is that the disks must skip over the parity blocks.\nA RAID 5 with a failed disk will continue to work. It is in \"degraded mode\". A degraded RAID 5 can be very slow. For this reason an additional disk is often added. This is called \"hot spare\" disk. If a disk fails, the data can be directly rebuilt onto the extra disk. RAID 5 can also be done in software quite easily.\nMainly because of performance problems of failed RAID 5 arrays, some database experts have formed a group called BAARF\u2014the \"Battle Against Any Raid Five\".\nIf the system fails while there are active writes, the parity of a stripe may become inconsistent with the data. If this is not repaired before a disk or block fails, data loss may occur. An incorrect parity will be used to reconstruct the missing block in that stripe. This problem is sometimes known as the \"write hole\". Battery-backed caches and similar techniques are commonly used to reduce the chance for this to occur.\nRAID levels used less.\nRAID 2.\nThis was used with very large computers. Special expensive disks and a special controller are needed to use RAID Level 2. The data is distributed at the bit-level (all other levels use byte-level actions). Special calculations are done. Data is split up into static sequences of bits. 8 data bits and 2 parity bits are put together. Then a Hamming code is calculated. The fragments of the Hamming code are then distributed over the different disks.\nRAID 2 is the only RAID level that can \"repair\" errors, the other RAID levels can only detect them. When they find that the information needed does not make sense, they will simply rebuild it. This is done with calculations, using information on the other disks. If that information is missing or wrong, they cannot do much. Because it uses Hamming codes, RAID 2 can find out which piece of the information is wrong, and correct only that piece.\nRAID 2 needs at least 10 disks to work. Because of its complexity and its need for very expensive and special hardware, RAID 2 is no longer used very much.\nRAID 3 \"striping with dedicated parity\".\nRaid Level 3 is much like RAID Level 0. An additional disk is added to store parity information. This is done by bitwise addition of the value of a block on the other disks. The parity information is stored on a separate (dedicated) disk. This is not good, because if the parity disk crashes, the parity information is lost.\nRAID Level 3 is usually done with at least 3 disks. A two-disk setup is identical to a RAID Level 0.\nRAID 4 \"striping with dedicated parity\".\nThis is very similar to RAID 3, except that the parity information is calculated over larger blocks, and not single bytes. This is like RAID 5. At least three disks are needed for a RAID 4 array.\nRAID 6.\nRAID level 6 was not an original RAID level. It adds an additional parity block to a RAID 5 array. It needs at least four disks (two disks for the capacity, two disks for redundancy). RAID 5 can be seen as a special case of a Reed-Solomon code. RAID 5 is a special case, though, it only needs addition in the Galois field \"GF(2)\". This is easy to do with XORs. RAID 6 extends these calculations. It is no longer a special case, and all of the calculations need to be done. With RAID 6, an extra checksum (called polynomial) is used, usually of \"GF (28)\". With this approach it is possible to protect against any number of failed disks. RAID 6 is for the case of using two checksums to protect against the loss of two disks.\nLike with RAID 5, parity and data are on different disks for each block. The two parity blocks are also located on different disks.\nThere are different ways to do RAID 6. They are different in their write performance, and in how much calculations are needed. Being able to do faster writes usually means more calculations are needed.\nRAID 6 is slower than RAID 5, but it allows the RAID to continue with any two disks failed. RAID 6 is becoming popular because it allows an array to be rebuilt after a single-drive failure even if one of the remaining disks has one or more bad sectors.\nNon-standard RAID levels.\nDouble parity / Diagonal parity.\nRAID 6 uses two parity blocks. These are calculated in a special way over a polynomial. \"Double parity\" RAID (also called \"diagonal parity\" RAID) uses a different polynomial for each of these parity blocks. Recently, the industry association that defined RAID said that double parity RAID is a different form of RAID 6.\nRAID-DP.\nRAID-DP is another way of having double parity.\nRAID 1.5.\nRAID 1.5 (not to be confused with RAID 15, which is different) is a proprietary RAID implementation. Like RAID 1, it only uses two disks, but it does both striping and mirroring (similar to RAID 10). Most things are done in hardware.\nRAID 5E, RAID 5EE and RAID 6E.\nRAID 5E, RAID 5EE and RAID 6E (with the added \"E\" for \"Enhanced\") generally refer to different types of RAID 5 or RAID 6 with a hot spare. With these implementations, the hot spare drive is not a physical drive. Rather, it exists in the form of free space on the disks. This increases performance, but it means that a hot spare cannot be shared between different arrays. The scheme was introduced by IBM ServeRAID around 2001.\nRAID 7.\nThis is a proprietary implementation. It adds caching to a RAID 3 or RAID 4 array.\nIntel Matrix RAID.\nSome Intel main boards have RAID chip that have this feature. It uses two or three disks, and then partitions them equally to form a combination of RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5 or RAID 1+0 levels.\nLinux MD RAID driver.\nThis is the name for the driver that allows to do software RAID with Linux. In addition to the normal RAID levels 0-6, it also has a RAID 10 implementation. Since Kernel 2.6.9, RAID 10 is a single level. The implementation has some non-standard features.\nRAID Z.\nSun has implemented a file system called ZFS. This file system is optimised for handling large amounts of data. It includes a Logical Volume Manager. It also includes a feature called RAID-Z. It avoids the problem called \"RAID 5 write hole\" because it has a copy-on-write policy: It does not overwrite the data directly, but writes new data in a new location on the disk. When the write was successful, the old data is deleted. It avoids the need for read-modify-write operations for small writes, because it only writes full-stripes. Small blocks are mirrored instead of parity protected, which is possible because the file system knows the way the storage is organised. It can therefore allocate extra space if necessary. There is also \"RAID-Z2\" which uses two forms of parity to achieve results similar to RAID 6: the ability to survive up to two drive failures without losing data.\nJoining RAID levels.\nWith RAID different disks can be put together to get a logical disk.The user will only see the logical disk. Each one of the RAID levels mentioned above has good and bad points. But RAID can also work with logical disks. That way one of the RAID levels above can be used with a set of logical disks. Many people note it by writing the numbers together. Sometimes, they write a '+' or an '&amp;' in between. Common combinations (using two levels) are the following:\nWith six disks of 300 GB each, a total capacity of 1.8TB, it is possible to make a RAID 5, with 1.5 TB usable space. In that array, one disk can fail without data loss. With RAID 50, the space is reduced to 1.2 TB, but one disk of each RAID 5 can fail, plus there is a noticeable increase in performance. RAID 51 reduces the usable size to 900 GB, but allows any three drives to fail.\nMaking a RAID.\nThere are different ways to make a RAID. It can either be done with software, or with hardware.\nSoftware RAID.\nA RAID can be made with software in two different ways. In the case of Software RAID, the disks are connected like normal hard disks. It is the computer that makes the RAID work. This means that for each access the CPU also needs to do the calculations for the RAID. The calculations for RAID 0 or RAID 1 are simple. However, the calculations for RAID 5, RAID 6, or one of the combined RAID levels can be a lot of work. In a software RAID, automatically booting from an array that failed may be a difficult thing to do. Finally, the way RAID is done in software depends on the operating system used; it is generally not possible to re-build a Software RAID array with a different operating system. Operating systems usually use hard disk partitions rather than whole hard disks to make RAID arrays.\nHardware RAID.\nA RAID can also be made with hardware. In this case, a special disk controller is used; this controller card hides the fact that it is doing RAID from the operating system and the user. The calculations of checksum information, and other RAID-related calculations are done on a special microchip in that controller. This makes the RAID independent of the operating system. The operating system will not see the RAID, it will see a single disk. Different manufacturers do RAID in different ways. This means that a RAID built with one hardware RAID controller cannot be rebuilt by another RAID controller of a different manufacturer. Hardware RAID controllers are often expensive to buy.\nHardware-assisted RAID.\nThis is a mix between hardware RAID and software RAID. Hardware-assisted RAID uses a special controller chip (like hardware RAID), but this chip can not do many operations. It is only active when the system is started; as soon as the operating system is fully loaded, this configuration is like software RAID. Some motherboards have RAID functions for the disks attached; most often, these RAID functions are done as \"hardware-assisted RAID\". This means that special software is needed to be able to use these RAID functions and to be able to recover from a failed disk.\nDifferent terms related to hardware failures.\nThere are different terms that are used when talking about hardware failures:\nFailure rate.\nThe failure rate is how often a system fails. The \"mean time to failure\" (MTTF) or \"mean time between failures\" (MTBF) of a RAID system is the same as that of its components. A RAID system cannot protect against failures of its individual hard drives, after all. The more complicated types of RAID (anything beyond \"striping\" or \"concatenation\") can help keep the data intact even if an individual hard drive fails, though.\nMean time to data loss.\nThe \"mean time to data loss\" (MTTDL) gives the average time before a loss of data happens in a given array. Mean time to data loss of a given RAID may be higher or lower than that of its hard disks. This depends on the type of RAID used.\nMean time to recovery.\nArrays that have redundancy can recover from some failures. The \"mean time to recovery\" shows how long it takes until a failed array is back to its normal state. This adds both the time to replace a failed disk mechanism as well as time to re-build the array (i.e. to replicate data for redundancy).\nUnrecoverable bit error rate.\nThe \"unrecoverable bit error rate\" (UBE) tells how long a disk drive will be unable to recover data after using cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes and multiple retries.\nProblems with RAID.\nThere are also certain problems with the ideas or the technology behind RAID:\nAdding disks at a later time.\nCertain RAID levels allow to extend the array by simply adding hard disks, at a later time. Information such as parity blocks is often scattered on several disks. Adding a disk to the array means that a reorganisation becomes necessary. Such a reorganisation is like a re-build of the array, it can take a long time. When this is done, the additional space may not be available yet, because both the file system on the array, and the operating system need to be told about it. Some file systems do not support to be grown after they have been created. In such a case, all the data needs to be backed up, the array needs be re-created with the new layout, and the data needs to be restored onto it.\nAnother option to add storage is to create a new array, and to let a logical volume manager handle the situation. This allows to grow almost any RAID system, even RAID1 (which by itself is limited to two disks).\nLinked failures.\nThe error correction mechanism in RAID assumes that failures of drives are independent. It is possible to calculate how often a piece of equipment can fail and to arrange the array to make data loss very improbable.\nIn practice, however, the drives were often bought together. They have roughly the same age, and have been used similarly (called \"wear\"). Many drives fail because of mechanical problems. The older a drive is, the more worn are its mechanical parts. Mechanical parts that are old are more likely to fail than those that are younger. This means that drive failures are no longer statistically independent. In practice, there is a chance that a second disk will also fail before the first has been recovered. This means that data loss can occur at significant rates, in practice.\nAtomicity.\nAnother problem that also occurs with RAID systems is that applications expect what is called \"Atomicity\": Either all of the data is written, or none is. Writing the data is known as a \"transaction\".\nIn RAID arrays, the new data is usually written in the place where the old data was. This has become known as \"update in-place\". Jim Gray, a database researcher wrote a paper in 1981 where he described this problem.\nVery few storage systems allow \"atomic write semantics\". When an object is written to disk, a RAID storage device will usually be writing all copies of the object in parallel. Very often, there is only one processor responsible for writing the data. In such a case, the writes of data to the different drives will overlap. This is known as \"overlapped write\" or \"staggered write\". An error that occurs during the process of writing may therefore leave the redundant copies in different states. What is worse, it may leave the copies in neither the old nor the new state. Logging relies on the original data being either in the old or the new state, though. This permits backing out the logical change, but few storage systems provide an atomic write semantic on a RAID disk.\nUsing a battery-backed write cache can solve this problem, but only in a power failure scenario.\nTransactional support is not present in all hardware RAID controllers. Therefore, many operating systems include it to protect against data loss during an interrupted write. Novell Netware, starting with version 3.x, included a transaction tracking system. Microsoft introduced transaction tracking via the journaling feature in NTFS. NetApp WAFL file system solves it by never updating the data in place, as does ZFS.\nUnrecoverable data.\nSome sectors on a hard disk may have become unreadable because of a mistake. Some RAID implementations can deal with this situation by moving the data elsewhere and marking the sector on the disk as bad. This happens at about 1 bit in 1015 in enterprise-class disk drives, and 1 bit in 1014 in ordinary disk drives. Disk capacities are steadily increasing. This may mean that sometimes, a RAID cannot be rebuilt, because such an error is found when the array is rebuilt after a disk failure. Certain technologies such as RAID 6 try to address this issue, but they suffer from a very high write penalty, in other words writing data becomes very slow.\nWrite cache reliability.\nThe disk system can acknowledge the write operation as soon as the data is in the cache. It does not need to wait until the data has been physically written. However, any power outage can then mean a significant data loss of any data queued in such a cache.\nWith hardware RAID, a battery can be used to protect this cache. This often solves the problem. When the power fails, the controller can finish writing the cache when the power is back. This solution can still fail, though: the battery may have worn out, the power may have been off for too long, the disks could be moved to another controller, the controller itself could fail. Certain systems can do periodic battery checks, but these use the battery itself, and leave it in a state where it is not fully charged.\nEquipment compatibility.\nThe disk formats on different RAID controllers are not necessarily compatible. Therefore, it may not be possible to read a RAID array on different hardware. Consequently, a non-disk hardware failure may require using identical hardware, or a backup, to recover the data.\nWhat RAID can and cannot do.\nThis guide was taken from a thread in a RAID-related forum. This was done to help point out the advantages and disadvantages of choosing RAID. It is directed at people who want to choose RAID for either increases in performance or redundancy. It contains links to other threads in its forum containing user-generated anecdotal reviews of their RAID experiences.\nExample.\nThe RAID levels used most often are RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5. Suppose there is a 3 disk setup, with 3 identical disks of 1 TB each, and the probability of failure of a drive for a given timespan is 1%."}

He was, by tradition, a slave of African descent who lived from about 620 BC to 560 BC in Ancient Greece. \nAesop's Fables are still taught as moral lessons and used as subjects for entertainment, especially children's plays and cartoons. Aesop is \"said\" to have written thousands of fables, but none has been verified. This means we do not know whether he wrote any, or perhaps just collected them. His most famous one was perhaps \"The Lion and the Mouse\".\nNo writings by him survive. Tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages. This is a storytelling tradition that continues to the present day. Many of the tales have animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics.\nThe tradition is that he was at one point freed from slavery and that he eventually died at the hands of Delphians. In fact, the doubt about his life has led some to deny his existence altogether.\nHis most famous fable is a parable of the tortoise and the hare. In this story, a rabbit challenges a tortoise to a race. The rabbit is sure of its victory and as a result, depending on the version of the story, in some way completes the race slower than the turtle. Often, the hare takes a nap or takes too many breaks. The persistent tortoise, despite being slower, wins because it persevered.\nAesop's Fables.\nAesop's Fables or \"Aesopica\" refers to a collection of fables credited to Aesop. Aesop's Fables has also become a blanket term for collections of brief fables, usually involving personified animals.\nThe fables remain a popular choice for moral education of children today. Many stories included in Aesop's Fables, such as \"The Fox and the Grapes\" (from which the idiom \"sour grapes\" was derived), \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" (see Zeno's paradoxes) and \"The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf\" (also known as \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\"), are well-known throughout the world."}

The sense of smell is how a human or animal notices a smell (or odour or odor) by using the nose. Many animals have better noses than people. Some animals can detect small particles in the air or sometimes water that people cannot. \nPeople have special cells in the nose that can detect some chemicals. These are special nerve cells attached to the olfactory epithelium. All vertebrates have these cells. The smell is first processed by the olfactory system. The information is given to the olfactory bulb in the front of the forebrain. \nIn insects, smells are sensed by sensillum on the antennae and first processed by the antennal lobe.\nOlfactory reception cells.\nThe olfactory reception (OR) cells are neurons (nerve cells). Many tiny hair-like cilia stick out of these cells into the mucus covering the surface of the epithelium. The surface of these cilia is covered with olfactory receptors, a kind of protein. \nThere are about 1000 different genes which code for the ORs, though only about a third are functional. The rest are pseudogenes. The OR genes are the largest gene family. An odor molecule dissolves into the mucus of the olfactory epithelium and then binds to an OR. Various odor molecules bind to various ORs. The basis of the sense of smell is that different groups of scent molecules bind to different receptor cells and so fire different groups of neurons. Inside the olfactory region of the brain, the firing of neurons produces the perceived smell. \nWhen the OR is activated, changes start in the cells. Positive ions come in and negative ions go out of the cells. This causes the neuron to fire an impulse (generate an action potential)."}

It originated in the village of Camembert in Normandy. Since 1983, the name \"Camembert de Normandie\" has been protected as Appellation d'Origine control\u00e9e (AOC).\nProduction.\nCamembert is made from unpasteurized cow's milk, and is ripened by the moulds \"Penicillium candida\" and \"Penicillium camemberti\" for at least three weeks. It is produced in small rounds, about 250 grams in weight, which are wrapped in paper and boxed in thin wooden boxes.\nCharacteristics.\nWhen fresh, it is quite crumbly and relatively hard, but it characteristically ripens and becomes more runny and strongly flavoured as it ages.\nCamembert can be used in many dishes, but it is popularly eaten uncooked on bread or with wine or meat, to enjoy the subtle flavour and texture which do not survive heating.\nHistory.\nCamembert was reputedly invented in 1791 by Marie Harel, a farmer from Normandy. However, the origin of the cheese we know today as camembert is more likely to rest with the beginnings of the industrialisation of the cheese-making process at the end of the 19th century. In 1890, an engineer, M. Ridel invented the wooden box which was used to carry the cheese and helped to send it for longer distances, in particular to America where it became very popular. These boxes are still used today.\nBefore fungi were properly understood, the colour of Camembert rind was a matter of chance, most commonly blue-grey, with brown spots. From the early 20th century onwards the rind has been more commonly pure white, but it was not until the mid-1970s that pure white became standard.\nThe cheese was famously issued to French troops in the First World War, becoming firmly fixed in the French popular culture as a result. It has many other roles in French culture, literature and history. It is now internationally known, and many local varieties are made around the world.\nThe cheese is said to have inspired Salvador Dal\u00ed to create his famous painting, \"The Persistence of Memory\". Its \"melting\" watches were inspired by the sight of a melting wheel of over-ripe Camembert.\nThe Camembert de Normandie was granted a protected designation of origin in 1992 after the original AOC in 1983.\nReferences.\n\"Camembert: A National Myth\" by Pierre Boisard claims that Camembert was one of the first globalised, homogenised and standardised foods."}

Shiva is causeless auspiciousness. An embodiment of ultimate space of enlightenment. He assumed human form to guide humans in the past and thus is known as Adhiguru (first guru). \nHis space of enlightenment is what all spiritual seekers aspire for. All enlightened masters live in this space of Shiva. Shiva is known as the destroyer god because he removes all evil from the world. His wife is the goddess Parvati or Devi Durga. \nAccording to Hindu legend, he has a blue neck because he swallowed a poison in order to save the universe. He has three eyes, the third eye is on his forehead. Shiva is one-third of the Hindu trimurti including Brahma and Vishnu. Lord Shiva lives in the Mount Kailash with his two sons Kartikeya and Ganesha who is known as the Remover of Obstacles. There is a statue of Shiva in Bangalore which is a great tourist attraction.\nEtymology and other names.\nMain article: Shiva Sahasranama\nAn ancient sculpture of Shiva at the Elephanta Caves, Maharashtra\nIn the earliest of the vedic texts, the word \"Shiva\" means Auspicious, Sacred. It does not relate to any deity, but refers to the quality of being sacred and auspicious.\nIn later vedic texts, Shiva becomes a deity. Shiva is also called as \"Brahman\", the supreme universal consciousness. The word \"shivo'ham\" translates as \"I am Shiva\", conveying that one's consciousness is where the lord resides, uniting it with the supreme \"transcendence\". In Tamil, he was called by different names other than Sivan. Nataraja (Dancing form of Shiva), Rudra (Enraged form of Shiva), and Dhakshinamoorthy (Yoga form of Shiva). Nataraja is the only form of Shiva worshipped in a human figure format. Elsewhere he is worshipped in Lingam figure. Pancha Bootha temples are located in south India. Pancha Bhoota Stalam refers to five temples dedicated to Shiva. Tamil literature is enriched by Shiva devotees called 63 Nayanmars (Nayanars).\nA sculpture of Shiva with Moustache at Archaeological Museum, Goa\nThe Sanskrit word \"\u015biva\" (Devanagari: \u0936\u093f\u0935, also transliterated as \"shiva\") means, states Monier Monier-Williams, \"auspicious, propitious, gracious, benign, kind, benevolent, friendly\". The roots of \"\u015biva\" in folk etymology are \"\u015b\u012b\" which means \"in whom all things lie, pervasiveness\" and \"va\" which means \"embodiment of grace\".\nThe word Shiva is used as an adjective in the Rig Veda (approximately 1700\u20131100 BC), as an epithet for several Rigvedic deities, including Rudra. The term Shiva also connotes \"liberation, final emancipation\" and \"the auspicious one\", this adjective sense of usage is addressed to many deities in Vedic layers of literature. The term evolved from the Vedic \"Rudra-Shiva\" to the noun \"Shiva\" in the Epics and the Puranas, as an auspicious deity who is the \"creator, reproducer and dissolver\".\nSharva, sharabha presents another etymology with the Sanskrit root \"\"\u015barv\"-\", which means \"to injure\" or \"to kill\", interprets the name to connote \"one who can kill the forces of darkness\".\nThe Sanskrit word '\u015baiva' means \"relating to the god Shiva\", and this term is the Sanskrit name both for one of the principal sects of Hinduism and for a member of that sect. It is used as an adjective to characterize certain beliefs and practices, such as Shaivism.\nThe \"Vishnu sahasranama\" interprets \"Shiva\" to have multiple meanings: \"The Pure One\", and \"the One who is not affected by three Gu\u1e47as of Prak\u1e5bti (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas)\".\nShiva is known by many names such as Viswanatha (lord of the universe), Mahadeva, Mahandeo, Mahasu, Mahesha, Maheshvara, Shankara, Shambhu, Rudra, Hara, Trilochana, Devendra (chief of the gods), Neelakanta, Subhankara, Trilokinatha (lord of the three realms), and Ghrneshwar (lord of compassion). The highest reverence for Shiva in Shaivism is reflected in his epithets 'Mah\u0101deva' (\"Great god\"; 'mah\u0101' \"Great\" and \"deva\" \"god\"), 'Mahe\u015bvara' (\"Great Lord\"; 'mah\u0101' \"great\" and '\u012b\u015bvara' \"lord\"), and 'Parame\u015bvara' (\"Supreme Lord\").\nSahasranama are medieval Indian texts that list a thousand names derived from aspects and epithets of a deity. There are at least eight different versions of the \"Shiva Sahasranama\", devotional hymns (\"stotras\") listing many names of Shiva. The version appearing in Book 13 (\"Anu\u015b\u0101sanaparvan\") of the \"Mahabharata\" provides one such list. Shiva also has \"Dasha-Sahasranamas\" (10,000 names) that are found in the \"Mahanyasa\". The \"Shri Rudram Chamakam\", also known as the \"\u015aatarudriya\", is a devotional hymn to Shiva hailing him by many names.\nHistorical development and literature.\nSee also: History of Shaivism\nThe Shiva-related tradition is a major part of Hinduism, found all over the Indian subcontinent, such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia, such as Bali, Indonesia. Scholars have interpreted early prehistoric paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters, carbon dated to be from pre-10,000 BCE period, as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi. Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trishul, have been described as Nataraja by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the mesolithic.\nIndus Valley origins.\nMain article: Pashupati seal\nSeal discovered during excavation of the Indus Valley archaeological site in the Indus Valley has drawn attention as a possible representation of a \"yogi\" or \"proto-Shiva\" figure.\nOf several Indus valley seals that show animals, one seal that has attracted attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly ithyphallic, seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position, surrounded by animals. This figure was named by early excavators of Mohenjo-daro as \"Pashupati\" (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit 'pa\u015bupati'), an epithet of the later Hindu deities Shiva and Rudra.\nSir John Marshall and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined. Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns. Scholars such as Gavin Flood, John Keay and Doris Meth Srinivasan have expressed doubts about this suggestion.\nGavin Flood states that it is not clear from the seal that the figure has three faces, is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure. He characterizes these views as \"speculative\", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva iconographic themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a bull. John Keay writes that \"he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati\", but a couple of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra. Writing in 1997, Srinivasan interprets what John Marshall interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.\nThe interpretation of the seal continues to be disputed. McEvilley, for example, states that it is not possible to \"account for this posture outside the yogic account\". Asko Parpola states that other archaeological finds such as the early Elamite seals dated to 3000-2750 BCE show similar figures and these have been interpreted as \"seated bull\" and not a yogi, and the bovine interpretation is likely more accurate. Gregory L. Possehl in 2002, associated it with the water buffalo, and concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would \"go too far\".\nVedic origins.\nThe Vedic literature refers to a minor atmospheric deity, with fearsome powers called Rudra. The Rigveda, for example, has 3 out of 1,028 hymns dedicated to Rudra, and he finds occasional mention in other hymns of the same text. The term Shiva also appears in the Rigveda, but simply as an epithet, that means \"kind, auspicious\", one of the adjectives used to describe many different Vedic deities. While fierce ruthless natural phenomenon and storm-related Rudra is feared in the hymns of the Rigveda, the beneficial rains he brings are welcomed as Shiva aspect of him. This healing, nurturing, life-enabling aspect emerges in the Vedas as Rudra-Shiva, and in post-Vedic literature ultimately as Shiva who combines the destructive and constructive powers, the terrific and the gentle, as the ultimate recycler and rejuvenator of all existence.\nThe similarities between the iconography and theologies of Shiva with Greek and European deities have led to proposals for an Indo-European link for Shiva, or lateral exchanges with ancient central Asian cultures. His contrasting aspects such as being terrifying or blissful depending on the situation, are similar to those of the Greek god Dionysus, as are their iconic associations with bull, snakes, anger, bravery, dancing and carefree life. The ancient Greek texts of the time of Alexander the Great call Shiva as \"Indian Dionysus\", or alternatively call Dionysus as \"god of the Orient\". Similarly, the use of phallic symbol as an icon for Shiva is also found for Irish, Nordic, Greek (Dionysus) and Roman deities, as was the idea of this aniconic column linking heaven and earth among early Indo-Aryans, states Roger Woodward. Others contest such proposals, and suggest Shiva to have emerged from indigenous pre-Aryan tribal origins.\nRudra.\nThree-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century AD\nShiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra, and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, the god of the roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.\nThe oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the Rig Veda, which is dated to between 1700 and 1100 BC based on linguistic and philological evidence. A god named Rudra is mentioned in the Rig Veda. The name Rudra is still used as a name for Shiva. In RV 2.33, he is described as the \"Father of the Rudras\", a group of storm gods.\nThe hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (Rudra), another that is kind and tranquil (Shiva). The Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (\"vahana\") of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.\nAgni.\nRudra and Agni have a close relationship. The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra's gradual development into the later character as Rudra-Shiva. The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the \"Nirukta\", an important early text on etymology, which says, \"Agni is also called Rudra.\" The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:The fire myth of \"Rudra-\u015aiva\" plays on the whole gamut of fire, valuing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumination.In the \"\u015aatarudr\u012bya\", some epithets of Rudra, such as \"Sasipa\u00f1jara\" (\"Of golden red hue as of flame\") and \"Tiva\u1e63\u012bmati\" (\"Flaming bright\"), suggest a fusing of the two deities. Agni is said to be a bull, and Lord Shiva possesses a bull as his vehicle, Nandi. The horns of Agni, who is sometimes characterized as a bull, are mentioned. In medieval sculpture, both Agni and the form of Shiva known as Bhairava have flaming hair as a special feature.\nIndra.\nVima Kadphises with ithyphallic Shiva.\nCoin of the Kushan Empire (1st-century BCE to 2nd-century CE). The right image has been interpreted as Shiva with trident and bull.\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the Puranic Shiva is a continuation of the Vedic Indra. Doniger gives several reasons for her hypothesis. Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the transgression of established mores, the Aum sound, the Supreme Self. In the Rig Veda the term '\u015biva' is used to refer to Indra. (2.20.3, 6.45.17, and 8.93.3.) Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull. In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the Maruts, but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra.\nThe Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion. The earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva's trident and phallic symbolism in this art suggests it was likely Shiva. Numismatics research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient Kushan Empire that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva. The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.\nThe texts and artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, although not identical generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly in their respective mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras in a manner similar to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests that there may be a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.\nLater literature.\nRudra's evolution from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" (400\u2013200 BC), according to Gavin Flood. Prior to it, the Upanishadic literature is monistic, and the \"Shvetashvatara\" text presents the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva is identified as the creator of the cosmos and liberator of souls from the birth-rebirth cycle. The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Shaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali's \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya\" (2nd-century BC) and in the \"Mahabharata\". Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.\nSelf-realization and Shaiva Upanishads\nHe who sees himself in all beings,\nAnd all beings in him,\nattains the highest Brahman,\nnot by any other means.\nThe Shaiva Upanishads are a group of 14 minor Upanishads of Hinduism variously dated from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the 17th century. These extol Shiva as the metaphysical unchanging reality Brahman and the Atman (soul, self), and include sections about rites and symbolisms related to Shiva.\nA few texts such as \"Atharvashiras Upanishad\" mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. The \"Kaivalya Upanishad\" similarly, states Paul Deussen \u2013 a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who \"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart.\nThe Shaiva Puranas, particularly the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the various aspects of Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (\"Tirtha\") associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider soul within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, \"dvaita\"), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, \"advaita\"), and that Shiva is the soul, the perfection and truth within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty-four monism Agama texts.\nShiva-related literature developed extensively across India in the 1st millennium CE and through the 13th century, particularly in Kashmir and Tamil Shaiva traditions. The monist Shiva literature posit absolute oneness, that is Shiva is within every man and woman, Shiva is within every living being, Shiva is present everywhere in the world including all non-living being, and there is no spiritual difference between life, matter, man and Shiva. The various dualistic and monist Shiva-related ideas were welcomed in medieval southeast Asia, inspiring numerous Shiva-related temples, artwork and texts in Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, with syncretic integration of local pre-existing theologies.\nAssimilation of traditions.\nSee also: Roots of Hinduism\nThe figure of Shiva as we know him today may be an amalgamation of various older deities into a single figure. How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not understood, a challenge to trace and has attracted much speculation. According to Vijay Nath, for example:Vishnu and Siva [...] began to absorb countless local cults and deities within their folds. The latter were either taken to represent the multiple facets of the same god or else were supposed to denote different forms and appellations by which the god came to be known and worshipped. [...] Siva became identified with countless local cults by the sheer suffixing of \"Isa\" or \"Isvara\" to the name of the local deity, e.g., Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara.\"An example of assimilation took place in Maharashtra, where a regional deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes. The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri. Khandoba has been assimilated as a form of Shiva himself, in which case he is worshipped in the form of a lingam. Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with Surya and Karttikeya.\nPosition within Hinduism.\nLingodbhava is a Shaiva sectarian icon where Shiva is depicted rising from the Lingam (an infinite fiery pillar) that narrates how Shiva is the foremost of the Trimurti; Brahma and Vishnu are depicted bowing to Lingodbhava Shiva in the centre.\nShaivism.\nMain articles: Shaivism and History of Shaivism\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition. Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere. Shiva is the primal soul, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions.\nThe Shaivism theology is broadly grouped into two: the popular theology influenced by Shiva-Rudra in the Vedas, Epics and the Puranas; and the esoteric theology influenced by the Shiva and Shakti-related Tantra texts. The Vedic-Brahmanic Shiva theology includes both monist (\"Advaita\") and devotional traditions (\"Dvaita\") such as Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta and Lingayatism with temples featuring items such as linga, Shiva-Parvati iconography, bull Nandi within the premises, relief artwork showing mythologies and aspects of Shiva.\nThe Tantric Shiva tradition ignored the mythologies and Puranas related to Shiva, and depending on the sub-school developed a variety of practices. For example, historical records suggest the tantric Kapalikas (literally, the 'skull-men') co-existed with and shared many Vajrayana Buddhist rituals, engaged in esoteric practices that revered Shiva and Shakti wearing skulls, begged with empty skulls, used meat, alcohol, and sexuality as a part of ritual. In contrast, the esoteric tradition within Kashmir Shaivism has featured the \"Krama\" and \"Trika\" sub-traditions. The Krama sub-tradition focussed on esoteric rituals around Shiva-Kali pair. The Trika sub-tradition developed a theology of triads involving Shiva, combined it with an ascetic lifestyle focusing on personal Shiva in the pursuit of monistic self liberation.\nVaishnavism.\nThe Vaishnava (Vishnu-oriented) literature acknowledges and discusses Shiva. Like Shaiva literature that presents Shiva as supreme, the Vaishnava literature presents Vishnu as supreme. However, both traditions are pluralistic and revere both Shiva and Vishnu (along with Devi), their texts do not show exclusivism, and Vaishnava texts such as the \"Bhagavata Purana\" while praising Krishna as the Ultimate Reality, also present Shiva and Shakti as a personalized form an equivalent to the same Ultimate Reality. The texts of Shaivism tradition similarly praise Vishnu. The Skanda Purana, for example, states:Vishnu is no one but Shiva, and he who is called Shiva is but identical with Vishnu.\n\u2014\u2009Mythologies of both traditions include legends about who is superior, about Shiva paying homage to Vishnu, and Vishnu paying homage to Shiva. However, in texts and artwork of either tradition, the mutual salutes are symbolism for complementarity. The Mahabharata declares the unchanging Ultimate Reality (Brahman) to be identical to Shiva and to Vishnu, that Vishnu is the highest manifestation of Shiva, and Shiva is the highest manifestation of Vishnu.\nShaktism.\nArdhanarishvara sculpture, Khajuraho, depicting Shiva with goddess Parvati as his equal half. In the Ardhanarisvara concept, the icon is presented as half-man and half woman.\nThe goddess-oriented Shakti tradition of Hinduism is based on the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner. This partner is Shiva.\nThe earliest evidence of the tradition of reverence for the feminine with Rudra-Shiva context, is found in the Hindu scripture \"Rigveda\", in a hymn called the Devi Sukta:3. I am ruler, assembler of goods, observer foremost among those deserving the sacrifice.\nMe have the gods distributed in many places\u2014so that I have many stations and cause many things to enter (me).\n4. Through me he eats food\u2014whoever sees, whoever breathes, whoever hears what is spoken.\nWithout thinking about it, they live on me. Listen, o you who are listened to: it\u2019s a trustworthy thing I tell you.\n5. Just I myself say this, savored by gods and men:\n\"Whom I love, just him I make formidable, him a formulator, him a seer,\nhim of good wisdom\".\n6. I stretch the bow for Rudra, for his arrow to smash the hater of the\nsacred formulation.\nI make combat for the people. I have entered Heaven and Earth.\n7. I give birth to Father (Heaven) on his (own) head [Agni]; my womb is in the waters, in the sea.\nThence I spread forth across all worlds, and yonder heaven with its height I touch.\n8. I, just like the wind, blow forth, grasping at all worlds,\nbeyond heaven, beyond this earth here\u2014of such size in my greatness\nhave I come into being.\n\u2014\u2009The \"Devi Upanishad\" in its explanation of the theology of Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva such as in its verse 19. Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the \"Devi Mahatmya\", a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to be as important as the \"Bhagavad Gita\". The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half-man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.\nSmarta Tradition.\nMain article: Panchayatana puja\nOleograph by Raja Ravi Varma depicting a Shiva-centric Panchayatana. A bearded Shiva sits in the centre with his wife Parvati and their infant son Ganesha; surrounded by (clockwise from left upper corner) Ganesha, Devi, Vishnu, and Surya. Shiva's mount is the bull Nandi below Shiva.\nIn the Smarta tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is a part of its Panchayatana puja. This practice consists of the use of icons or anicons of five deities considered equivalent, set in a quincunx pattern. Shiva is one of the five deities, others being Vishnu, Devi (such as Parvati), Surya and Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee's preference (Ishta Devata).\nPhilosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualize aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, recognize the Absolute symbolized by the icons, on the path to realizing the nondual identity of one's Atman (soul, self) and the Brahman. Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometers from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.\nYoga.\nAdiyogi Shiva statue, recognized by the \"Guinness World Records\" as the \"Largest Bust Sculpture\u201d in the world; the statue is for inspiring and promoting yoga, and is named \"Adiyogi\", which means \"the first yogi\", because Shiva is known as the originator of yoga.\nShiva is considered the Great Yogi who is totally absorbed in himself \u2013 the transcendental reality. He is the Lord of Yogis, and the teacher of Yoga to sages. As Shiva Dakshinamurthi, states Stella Kramrisch, he is the supreme guru who \"teaches in silence the oneness of one's innermost self (\"atman\") with the ultimate reality (\"brahman\").\"\nThe theory and practice of Yoga, in different styles, has been a part of all major traditions of Hinduism, and Shiva has been the patron or spokesperson in numerous Hindu Yoga texts. These contain the philosophy and techniques for Yoga. These ideas are estimated to be from or after the late centuries of the 1st millennium CE, and have survived as Yoga texts such as the \"Isvara Gita\" (literally, 'Shiva's song'), which Andrew Nicholson \u2013 a professor of Hinduism and Indian Intellectual History \u2013 states have had \"a profound and lasting influence on the development of Hinduism\".\nOther famed Shiva-related texts influenced Hatha Yoga, integrated monistic (\"Advaita Vedanta\") ideas with Yoga philosophy and inspired the theoretical development of Indian classical dance. These include the \"Shiva Sutras\", the \"Shiva Samhita\", and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism such as the 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta writes in his notes on the relevance of ideas related to Shiva and Yoga, by stating that \"people, occupied as they are with their own affairs, normally do nothing for others\", and Shiva and Yoga spirituality helps one look beyond, understand interconnectedness, and thus benefit both the individual and the world towards a more blissful state of existence.\nTrimurti.\nMain article: Trimurti\nAn art depiction of the Trimurti, with Shiva depicted on the right, at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu.\nThe Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer. These three deities have been called \"the Hindu triad\" or the \"Great Trinity\". However, the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism feature many triads of gods and goddesses, some of which do not include Shiva.\nAttributes.\nShiva with Parvati. Shiva is depicted three-eyed, the Ganges flowing through his matted hair, wearing ornaments of serpents and a skull garland, covered in ashes, and seated on a tiger skin\nA seated Shiva holds an axe and deer in his hands.\nForms and depictions.\nAccording to Gavin Flood, \"Shiva is a god of ambiguity and paradox,\" whose attributes include opposing themes. The ambivalent nature of this deity is apparent in some of his names and the stories told about him.\nDestroyer and Benefactor.\nShiva is represented in his many aspects. Left: Bhairava icon of the fierce form of Shiva, from 17th/18th century Nepal; Right: Shiva as a meditating yogi in Rishikesh.\nIn Yajurveda, two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrifying (Sanskrit: 'rudra') and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: '\u015biva') forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that \"all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-\u015aiva sect of later ages are to be found here\". In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as \"the standard of invincibility, might, and terror\", as well as a figure of honor, delight, and brilliance.\nThe duality of Shiva's fearful and auspicious attributes appears in contrasted names. The name Rudra reflects Shiva's fearsome aspects. According to traditional etymologies, the Sanskrit name \"Rudra\" is derived from the root \"rud-\", which means \"to cry, howl\". Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form \"raudra\", which means \"wild, of \"rudra\" nature\", and translates the name \"Rudra\" as \"the wild one\" or \"the fierce god\". R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as \"terrible\". Hara is an important name that occurs three times in the Anushasanaparvan version of the \"Shiva sahasranama\", where it is translated in different ways each time it occurs, following a commentorial tradition of not repeating an interpretation. Sharma translates the three as \"one who captivates\", \"one who consolidates\", and \"one who destroys\". Kramrisch translates it as \"the ravisher\". Another of Shiva's fearsome forms is as \"K\u0101la\" \"time\" and \"Mah\u0101k\u0101la\" \"great time\", which ultimately destroys all things. The name \"K\u0101la\" appears in the \"Shiva Sahasranama\", where it is translated by Ram Karan Sharma as \"(the Supreme Lord of) Time\". Bhairava \"terrible\" or \"frightful\" is a fierce form associated with annihilation. In contrast, the name \"\u015aa\u1e47kara\", \"beneficent\" or \"conferring happiness\" reflects his benign form. This name was adopted by the great Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara (c. 788\u2013820), who is also known as Shankaracharya. The name \"\u015aambhu\" (Sanskrit: \u0936\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0941 swam-on its own; bhu-burn/shine) \"self-shining/ shining on its own\", also reflects this benign aspect.\nAscetic and householder.\nShiva is depicted both as an ascetic yogi, and as a householder with goddess Parvati.\nShiva is depicted as both an ascetic yogi and as a householder (grihasta), roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society. When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating. His epithet Mah\u0101yogi (\"the great Yogi: 'Mah\u0101' = \"great\", \"Yogi\" = \"one who practices Yoga\") refers to his association with yoga. While Vedic religion was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the Epic period that the concepts of tapas, yoga, and asceticism became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts.\nAs a family man and householder, he has a wife, Parvati and two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. His epithet \"Um\u0101pati\" (\"The husband of \"Um\u0101\"\") refers to this idea, and Sharma notes that two other variants of this name that mean the same thing, \"Um\u0101k\u0101nta\" and \"Um\u0101dhava\", also appear in the \"sahasranama\". \"Um\u0101\" in epic literature is known by many names, including the benign \"P\u0101rvat\u012b\". She is identified with Devi, the Divine Mother; Shakti (divine energy) as well as goddesses like Tripura Sundari, Durga, Kali, Kamakshi and Minakshi. The consorts of Shiva are the source of his creative energy. They represent the dynamic extension of Shiva onto this universe. His son Ganesha is worshipped throughout India and Nepal as the Remover of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings and Lord of Obstacles. Kartikeya is worshipped in South India (especially in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka) by the names Subrahmanya, Subrahmanyan, Shanmughan, Swaminathan and Murugan, and in Northern India by the names Skanda, Kumara, or Karttikeya.\nSome regional deities are also identified as Shiva's children. As one story goes, Shiva is enticed by the beauty and charm of Mohini, Vishnu's female avatar, and procreates with her. As a result of this union, Shasta \u2013 identified with regional deities Ayyappan and Aiyanar \u2013 is born. In outskirts of Ernakulam in Kerala, a deity named Vishnumaya is stated to be offspring of Shiva and invoked in local exorcism rites, but this deity is not traceable in Hindu pantheon and is possibly a local tradition with \"vaguely Chinese\" style rituals, states Saletore. In some traditions, Shiva has daughters like the serpent-goddess Manasa and Ashokasundari. According to Doniger, two regional stories depict demons Andhaka and Jalandhara as the children of Shiva who war with him, and are later destroyed by Shiva.\nIconographic forms.\nChola dynasty statue depicting Shiva dancing as Nataraja (Los Angeles County Museum of Art).\nThe depiction of Shiva as Nataraja (Sanskrit: 'na\u1e6dar\u0101ja', \"Lord of Dance\") is popular. The names Nartaka (\"dancer\") and Nityanarta (\"eternal dancer\") appear in the Shiva Sahasranama. His association with dance and also with music is prominent in the Puranic period. In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: 'n\u1e5btyam\u016brti') are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular. The two most common forms of the dance are the Tandava, which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world. When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Shiva does it by the Tandava, and Lasya, which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati. \"Lasya\" is regarded as the female counterpart of \"Tandava\". The \"Tandava\"-\"Lasya\" dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world.\nDakshinamurthy \"(\"Dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101m\u016brti\")\" literally describes a form ('m\u016brti') of Shiva facing south ('dak\u1e63i\u1e47a'). This form represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom and giving exposition on the \"shastras\". This iconographic form for depicting Shiva in Indian art is mostly from Tamil Nadu. Elements of this motif can include Shiva seated upon a deer-throne and surrounded by sages who are receiving his instruction.\nAn iconographic representation of Shiva called Ardhanarishvara ('Ardhan\u0101r\u012b\u015bvara') shows him with one half of the body as male and the other half as female. According to Ellen Goldberg, the traditional Sanskrit name for this form is best translated as \"the lord who is half woman\", not as \"half-man, half-woman\".\nShiva is often depicted as an archer in the act of destroying the triple fortresses, \"Tripura\", of the Asuras. Shiva's name Tripurantaka ('Tripur\u0101ntaka'), \"ender of Tripura\", refers to this important story.\nShiva Lingam with tripundra.\nLingam.\nMain article: Lingam\nApart from anthropomorphic images of Shiva, he is also represented in aniconic form of a lingam. These are depicted in various designs. One common form is the shape of a vertical rounded column in the centre of a lipped, disk-shaped object, the \"yoni\", symbolism for the goddess Shakti. In Shiva temples, the \"linga\" is typically present in its sanctum sanctorum and is the focus of votary offerings such as milk, water, flower petals, fruit, fresh leaves, and rice. According to Monier Williams and Yudit Greenberg, \"linga\" literally means 'mark, sign or emblem', and also refers to a \"mark or sign from which the existence of something else can be reliably inferred\". It implies the regenerative divine energy innate in nature, symbolized by Shiva. Some scholars, such as Wendy Doniger, view \"linga\" merely as an erotic phallic symbol, although this interpretation is criticized by others, including Swami Vivekananda, Sivananda Saraswati, and S. N. Balagangadhara. According to Moriz Winternitz, the \"linga\" in the Shiva tradition is \"only a symbol of the productive and creative principle of nature as embodied in Shiva\", and it has no historical trace in any obscene phallic cult.\nThe worship of the lingam originated from the famous hymn in the \"Atharva-Veda Samhit\u00e2\" sung in praise of the \"Yupa-Stambha\", the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless \"Stambha\" or \"Skambha\", and it is shown that the said \"Skambha\" is put in place of the eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the \"Soma\" plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the \"Yupa-Skambha\" gave place in time to the \"Shiva-Linga\". In the text \"Linga Purana\", the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.\nThe oldest known archaeological \"linga\" as an icon of Shiva is the Gudimallam lingam from 3rd-century BCE. In Shaivism pilgrimage tradition, twelve major temples of Shiva are called Jyotirlinga, which means \"linga of light\", and these are located across India.\nFive mantras.\nThe 10th century five headed Shiva, Sadashiva, Cambodia.\nFive is a sacred number for Shiva. One of his most important mantras has five syllables (\"nama\u1e25 \u015biv\u0101ya\").\nShiva's body is said to consist of five mantras, called the \"pa\u00f1cabrahmans\". As forms of God, each of these have their own names and distinct iconography:\nThese are represented as the five faces of Shiva and are associated in various texts with the five elements, the five senses, the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action. Doctrinal differences and, possibly, errors in transmission, have resulted in some differences between texts in details of how these five forms are linked with various attributes. The overall meaning of these associations is summarized by Stella Kramrisch:Through these transcendent categories, \u015aiva, the ultimate reality, becomes the efficient and material cause of all that exists.According to the \"Pa\u00f1cabrahma Upanishad\":One should know all things of the phenomenal world as of a fivefold character, for the reason that the eternal verity of \"\u015aiva\" is of the character of the fivefold Brahman. (\"Pa\u00f1cabrahma Upanishad\" 31)\nAvatars.\nPuranic scriptures contain occasional references to \"ansh\" \u2013 literally 'portion, or avatars of Shiva', but the idea of Shiva avatars is not universally accepted in Saivism. The Linga Purana mentions twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars, however such mention is unusual and the avatars of Shiva is relatively rare in Shaivism compared to the well emphasized concept of Vishnu avatars in Vaishnavism. Some Vaishnava literature reverentially link Shiva to characters in its mythologies. For example, in the \"Hanuman Chalisa\", Hanuman is identified as the eleventh avatar of Shiva. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" and the \"Vishnu Purana\" claim sage Durvasa to be a portion of Shiva. Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva.\nFestivals.\nMain article: Maha Shivaratri\nMaha Sivaratri festival is observed in the night, usually in lighted temples or special \"prabha\" (above).\nThere is a \"Shivaratri\" in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day, but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks \"Maha Shivaratri\" which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\".\nMaha Shivaratri is a major Hindu festival, but one that is solemn and theologically marks a remembrance of \"overcoming darkness and ignorance\" in life and the world, and meditation about the polarities of existence, of Shiva and a devotion to humankind. It is observed by reciting Shiva-related poems, chanting prayers, remembering Shiva, fasting, doing Yoga and meditating on ethics and virtues such as self-restraint, honesty, noninjury to others, forgiveness, introspection, self-repentance and the discovery of Shiva. The ardent devotees keep awake all night. Others visit one of the Shiva temples or go on pilgrimage to Jyotirlingam shrines. Those who visit temples, offer milk, fruits, flowers, fresh leaves and sweets to the lingam. Some communities organize special dance events, to mark Shiva as the lord of dance, with individual and group performances. According to Jones and Ryan, Maha Sivaratri is an ancient Hindu festival which probably originated around the 5th-century.\nAnother major festival involving Shiva worship is Kartik Purnima, commemorating Shiva's victory on the demons Tripurasura. Across India, various Shiva temples are illuminated throughout the night. Shiva icons are carried in procession in some places.\nThiruvathira is a festival observed in Kerala dedicated to Shiva. It is believed that on this day, Parvathi met Lord Shiva after her long penance and Lord Shiva took her as his wife. On this day Hindu women performs the Thiruvathirakali accompanied by Thiruvathira paattu (folk songs about Parvati and her longing and penance for Lord Shiva's affection).\nRegional festivals dedicated to Shiva include the Chittirai festival in Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of Minakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Minakshi in marriage to Shiva.\nSome Shaktism-related festivals revere Shiva along with the goddess considered primary and Supreme. These include festivals dedicated to Annapurna such as \"Annakuta\" and those related to Durga. In Himalayan regions such as Nepal, as well as in northern, central and western India, the festival of Teej is celebrated by girls and women in the monsoon season, in honor of goddess Parvati, with group singing, dancing and by offering prayers in Parvati-Shiva temples.\nThe ascetic, Vedic and Tantric sub-traditions related to Shiva, such as those that became ascetic warriors during the Islamic rule period of India, celebrate the Kumbha Mela festival. This festival cycles every 12 years, in four pilgrimage sites within India, with the event moving to the next site after a gap of three years. The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna. In the Hindu tradition, the Shiva-linked ascetic warriors (\"Nagas\") get the honor of starting the event by entering the \"Sangam\" first for bathing and prayers.\nBeyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism.\nShiva has been adopted and merged with Buddhist deities. Left: Daikokuten is a Shiva-\u014ckuninushi fusion deity in Japan; Right: Acala is a fierce Shiva adaptation.\nThe statue of Shiva engaging in the Nataraja dance at the campus of European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.\nIn Shaivism of Indonesia, the popular name for Shiva has been \"Batara Guru\", which is derived from Sanskrit \"Bhattaraka\" which means \"noble lord\". He is conceptualized as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Batara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him. Batara Guru's wife in southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualized with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others. Shiva has been called Sadasiva, Paramasiva, Mahadeva in benevolent forms, and Kala, Bhairava, Mahakala in his fierce forms. The Indonesian Hindu texts present the same philosophical diversity of Shaivism traditions found on the subcontinent. However, among the texts that have survived into the contemporary era, the more common are of those of Shaiva Siddhanta (locally also called Siwa Siddhanta, Sridanta).\nIn the pre-Islamic period on the island of Java, Shaivism and Buddhism were considered very close and allied religions, though not identical religions. The medieval era Indonesian literature equates Buddha with Siwa (Shiva) and Janardana (Vishnu). This tradition continues in predominantly Hindu Bali Indonesia in the modern era, where Buddha is considered the younger brother of Shiva.\nThe worship of Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the Hephthalite Empire, and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread (\"Yajnopavita\"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh. Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls. It is also noted that Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.\nDaikokuten, one of the Seven Lucky Gods in Japan, is considered to be evolved from Shiva. The god enjoys an exalted position as a household deity in Japan and is worshipped as the god of wealth and fortune. The name is the Japanese equivalent of Mah\u0101k\u0101la, the Buddhist name for Shiva. Shiva is also mentioned in Buddhist Tantra. Shiva as \"Upaya\" and Shakti as \"Prajna\". In cosmologies of Buddhist tantra, Shiva is depicted as passive, with Shakti being his active counterpart. In Mahayana Buddhist cosmology, Shiva resides in Akani\u1e63\u1e6dha, highest of \u015auddh\u0101v\u0101sa (Pure Abodes) where An\u0101g\u0101mi (\"Non-returners\") who are already on the path to Arhat-hood and who will attain enlightenment are born in.\nThe Japuji Sahib of the Guru Granth Sahib says, \"The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi.\" In the same chapter, it also says, \"Shiva speaks, and the Siddhas listen.\" In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh has mentioned two avtars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avtar and Parasnath Avtar.\nIn contemporary culture.\nSagar Shiv Mandir in Mauritius\nIn contemporary culture, Shiva is depicted in films, books, tattoos and art. He has been referred to as \"the god of cool things\" and a \"bonafide rock hero\".\nPopular films include the Gujarati language movie \"Har Har Mahadev\", the Kannada movie \"Gange Gowri\" and well-known books include Amish Tripathi's \"Shiva Trilogy\", which has sold over a million copies. On television, \"Devon Ke Dev...Mahadev\", a television serial about Lord Shiva on the Life OK channel was among the most watched shows at its peak popularity. A 90's television series of DD National titled Om Namah Shivay was also based on legends of Lord Shiva.\nIn the \"Final Fantasy\" videogame series, Shiva is often depicted as a benevolent ancient being of Ice Element who frequently aids the heroes against mighty foes (via summoning). Shiva is also a character in the video game \"Dark Souls\", with the name Shiva of the East.\nIn Shuumatsu no Valkyrie (Record of Ragnarok), Shiva is the representative of the gods in the 5th round of Ragnarok.\nOther websites.\nAarti of Shiva BhaktiSansar.in Viewed on 2020-08-01."}

There are many different reasons some people have piercings, such as religious or other cultural purposes. Many people, especially in North America and Europe, choose to be pierced for ornamental, or sexual pleasure.\nHistory.\nIn early records, it was not common to discuss the use of piercings or their meanings. However, body adornment and modification are estimated have been around for more than 5000 years, found in mummies like \u00d6tzi the Iceman, Europe's oldest natural mummy estimated to be about 5,300 years old. Piercing of the ears, nose, and tongue have a long history in many ancient cultures, and lip piercing and stretching were more common in African tribes, especially for cultural identification.\nPiercings in the 20th &amp; 21st century.\nBody piercings of any kind were not popular in Western cultures in the beginning of the 20th century. After World War II, the gay subculture used piercings as a fashion statement. Other subcultures, such as \"hippie\" and the punk movement also began to use piercings as a form of expression in the 1960s and 1970s. Genital piercing is becoming more common. Sometimes people get genital piercings to create interest or attract attention. Some types of genital piercing are supposed to increase sexual pleasure."}

{"id": "24914", "revid": "858753", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24914", "title": "Supernova", "text": "A supernova is the explosion of a giant star. It usually happens when its nuclear fusion cannot hold the core against its own gravity. The core collapses, and explodes. \nThe biggest stars that make supernovae are hypergiants and smaller ones are supergiants. They are massive: because of gravity, they use up their energy very quickly. Normally they only live for a few million years. \nDuring the explosion, the total energy radiated by supernovae may briefly outshine the entire output of a galaxy. They emit energy equal to that of the whole lifetime of a solar-like star. The explosion blows off its stellar material away from the star, at velocities up to 30,000 km/s or 10% of the speed of light. This drives a shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium. This sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust, which we see as a supernova remnant. After exploding, what is left becomes a black hole or a neutron star. \nMost stars are small and do not explode. They become colder and smaller, and they become white dwarf stars.\nSupernova explosions happen rarely. The last time people saw a supernova in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, was in the year 1604. We can see supernovas in other galaxies too. Every year we see 300 supernovas in other galaxies, because there are so many galaxies. Sometimes they are brighter than the whole rest of the galaxy.\nTypes.\nSupernovas are usually sorted into Type I and Type II supernovas.\nType I supernovas have absorption lines that show they do not have hydrogen in them. Type Ia supernovas are very bright for a short amount of time. Then they get less bright very quickly. Type Ia supernovas happen when a white dwarf star is orbiting a big star. Sometimes, the white dwarf star sucks matter off of the big star. When the white dwarf gets to be about 1.4 times the mass of the sun, it collapses. This makes lots of energy and light, which is why supernovas are very bright. Type 1a have mostly the same brightness. This allows them to be used as a secondary standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies.\nType II supernovas have absorption lines that show they do have hydrogen in them. A star must have at least 8 times, and no more than 40\u201350 times, the mass of the Sun to undergo this type of explosion.\nIn a star like the Sun, nuclear fusion turns hydrogen into helium. In very large stars, helium gets turned into oxygen, and so on. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no more fusion can take place. But, the collapse of the core is so rapid (about 23% of the speed of light) that a huge shock wave is produced. The extremely high temperature and pressure lasts long enough for a brief moment when the elements heavier than iron are produced. Depending on initial size of the star, the remnants of the core form a neutron star or a black hole.\nSupernovas and life.\nWithout supernovas there would be no life on Earth. This is because many of the chemical elements were made in supernova explosions. These are called \"heavy elements\". Heavy elements are needed to make living things. The supernova is the only natural way heavy elements can be made. Other elements were made by fusion in stars. Heavy elements need very high temperature and pressure to form. In a macho supernova explosion the temperature and pressure are so high that heavy elements can be made. Scientists call this \"supernova nucleosynthesis\".\nIt could be dangerous if a supernova explosion happened very close to the Earth. The explosion is very big and many kinds of dangerous radiation are formed. But we do not have to be afraid. Only very big stars can explode as supernovas. There are no stars big enough near the Earth and if there was it would take millions of years for it to happen.\nImportant supernovas.\nSN 1572 was seen by Tycho Brahe. This supernova helped astronomers learn that things in space could change. SN 1604 was seen by Johannes Kepler. It was the last supernova close enough to be seen from Earth's northern hemisphere without a telescope. SN 1987A is the only supernova so close that scientists could find neutrinos from it. SN 1987A was also bright enough to see without a telescope. People in the southern hemisphere saw it.\nEffects on Earth.\nThe Earth does have traces of past supernovae. Traces of radioactive iron-60, a strong indicator of supernova debris, is buried in the sea floor right across the globe. \nThe \"local bubble\" is a ballooning region of hot gas, 600 light-years across. It surrounds the Solar System and dominates our stellar neighbourhood. It was formed by over a dozen supernovae blowing up in a nearby moving clump of stars. This happened between 2.3 million and 1.5 million years ago. This roughly corresponds with the start of the Pleistocene ice ages. The connection may be accidental."}

People usually dance to disco music at bars called disco clubs. The word \"disco\" is also used to refer to the style of dancing that people do to disco music, or to the style of clothes that people wear to go disco dancing. Disco music was an up-tempo form of music which included elements of soul, funk and Latin music. It had a strong beat meant for dancing, a steady four-on-the-floor rhythm, and a big bass line, and orchestral instrumentation often included string sections. Disco is dance music too.\nDisco was at its most popular in the United States and Europe in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Disco was brought into the mainstream by the hit movie \"Saturday Night Fever,\" which was released in 1977. This movie, which starred John Travolta, showed people doing disco dancing. Many radio stations played disco in the late 1970s. By the early 1980s, disco had started to fall out of popularity, and other genres, such as dance, Hi-NRG and post-disco grew in popularity. Nevertheless, disco still exerts an influence on modern day dance music, and still has occasional moments of popularity. Additionally, a different form of disco arose in Europe, known as Euro disco, which obtained some popularity.\nDisco music.\nDisco music blends R&amp;B with funk, soul and dance music. Disco music usually consists of a singer, electric guitars, synthesizer keyboards, electric bass guitar, and a drummer or electronic drum machine. Disco music is often very simple music, with a strong beat and a strong \"bass line\". Disco music often has many electronic effects.\nDisco dancing.\nDisco dancing is often sexually suggestive. When people go disco dancing, they usually wear tight trousers, leather shoes or boots, and glittery clothes. Women going disco dancing often wore tight clothes that revealed body parts such as their thighs or the upper part of their chest. Men going disco dancing often opened up the buttons of their shirts to show the upper part of their chest.\nDisco clubs.\nDisco music is played at disco clubs. In the late 1970s, there were famous disco clubs such as Studio 54 in New York City. Disco clubs have a large dance floor and a large pa system. A Disk Jockey (or \"DJ\") plays records of disco music through powerful amplifiers with a number of high wattage speakers. Disco music was usually played very loud, with lots of low bass frequencies. Disco clubs usually had coloured lights that flashed with the music called scanners, and mirror balls with hundreds of small mirrors, that reflect light onto the dancers and all corners of the room.\nDisco culture.\nMost people who went disco dancing at disco clubs drank alcohol such as champagne and rum. Many people consumed illegal drugs such as cocaine or marijuana, so that they would become intoxicated. People who went disco dancing often had sex with people that they would meet at the disco club."}
