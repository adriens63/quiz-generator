The reason of the change was that the team was followed almost exclusively by Italian colonists and their descendants, so the management tried to get followers from the native Somalis erasing the Italian word \"calcio\" (that means 'football' in Italian).\nThe main rival of the AS Mogadiscio (the team of the Italians of the capital) was in the 1950s the Lavori Publici FC (or \"Genio Oficina\"), that was the team of the Italian of all Somalia and that had many native Somalis as fans.\nFinally, in the 1957-58 Championship, the AS Mogadiscio was named \"Champion of Somalia\", with the following results:\nIn the 1959-1960 Championship the AS Mogadishu disputed its last contest, being third.\nIn 1961 the team was declared \"closed\", mainly for economic reasons since it almost did not have followers (because of the almost total disappearance of the Italians of Mogadishu &amp; Somalia, who moved away -mainly to Italy))."}

Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), was a United States Supreme Court court case. It was between William Marbury and James Madison.\nBackground.\nIn the 1800 United States Presidential election, Thomas Jefferson won over John Adams. Days before Adams had to leave office, he wanted to give a number of people jobs (so that Jefferson could not give these jobs away). The United States Senate approved of his picks (nominations) and John Marshall, who was then Adams' Secretary of State and was to be the Chief Justice of the United States, had a number of these notices sent out. One that did not make it before midnight was to William Marbury.\nWhen Jefferson took office, he ordered \"his\" Secretary of State, James Madison, to cancel the ones that had not been delivered. So then Marbury sued Madison because Marbury wanted his job as Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia.\nDecision.\nJohn Marshall ruled on this case as the Chief Justice. He first answered that Marbury had a right to his job because it had been signed and approved. The actual delivery was a custom, not a requirement. He then ruled that a writ of mandamus (a type of court order) was the correct way for Marbury to rule. Finally, he noted that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed the Supreme Court to make this kind of ruling.\nThe next question was \"who\" could decide this issue. Marshall ruled that the Supreme Court could decide it because the Judiciary Act of 1789 said that they could. However, Marshall said that a section of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. That section allowed the Supreme Court to make a writ but the \"United States Constitution\" did not. Therefore, that section was unconstitutional and the Supreme Court could not make a writ for Marbury.\nMarshall looking over the Constitution and the statute is judicial review, a statement that the Supreme Court had an independent power to determine whether something was constitutional or not."}

{"id": "664152", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=664152", "title": "Exonym and endonym", "text": "An exonym is a name of a person, a people group, language, or place used by people of other places and languages. An endonym is a name that people of a certain place and language call themselves. For example, the endonym of Germany is \"Deutschland\", because that is what Germans call their country, and Germans call themselves and their language \"Deutsch\". On the other hand, Germany and German are its exonym because English speakers, who are not German, use those names to describe it.\nThis is actually very common across languages for several reasons. One reason is because the sounds for an endonym may not exist in certain languages. It would be difficult for speakers of other languages to say them, so speakers of other languages make an exonym. For example, words in Japanese cannot end in any consonant that is not an \"n\" sound, and for that reason, \"Deutsch\" is \"Doitsu\" in Japanese. Japanese also adds Japanese morphemes so that there is no confusion between the country, the people, and the language. The German people are \"Doitsujin\", in which \"-jin\" means people, and the name of the German language is \"Doitsugo\", in which \"-go\" means language. While the country, people, and language of Laos can all be called \"Lao\" in English, they are called \"Raosu\", \"Rasoujin\", and \"Raosugo\" in Japanese in that same order.\nAnother reason why a country might call another country a different name is because people from a certain country might have different ideas about those people or associate them with certain things. For example, even though Greeks call their country \"Hellas\", their country is known around the world as Greece because the Roman Empire named the region after \"Magna\" \"Graecia\", which were coastal areas in southern Italy that were colonized by Greeks in the early days of Rome. Germany has a very large number of exonyms, being called \"Allemagne\" in French, \"Niemcy\" in Polish, and \"Saksa\" in Finnish. This is because Germany has interacted with many other European countries and the Germans were a collection of tribes speaking similar languages until they unified into a country in the late 19th century. Even though the Dutch call themselves \"Nederlanders\" in their own language, English speakers call them Dutch (a cognate of the German word \"Deutsch\") because the words German and Dutch used to be interchangeable until Germany unified in the 1800s. From then on, German was used to describe people from Germany, while Dutch was used to describe people from the Netherlands.\nEven though in Mandarin Chinese China is called \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\", meaning the \"Middle Kingdom\" or the \"Central States\", most other countries calls it China. It is believed that the word China cam from the word \"Q\u00edn\", in which the Qin dynasty unified China. However, there are a few exceptions. In Japanese, it is called \"Ch\u016bgoku\", which has the same meaning as the Chinese name, except it uses the Japanese pronunciation for the Chinese characters for the name \u4e2d\u570b / \u4e2d\u56fd. In Korean, it is called \"Jungguk\" for the same reason. In Russian, China is called \"Kitay\".\nA third reason why a country might call another place a different name is because a language can borrow a name from another language. Even though Japan is called \"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\" in Japanese, the word passed on to Europe through many different languages, all of which were very different from Japanese. Marco Polo heard about Kublai Khan sending soldiers to Cipangu, which in Chinese characters is \u65e5\u672c, which means \"Sun's Origin\". When the Portuguese arrived in Japan in the mid-16th century, who were the first Europeans to directly trade with Japan, they called the country \"Jap\u00e3o\" based on an old Malay word, which was borrowed from a southern Chinese dialect. Thus, most other countries call the country Japan. A few exceptions are Chinese, which call it \"R\u00ecb\u011bn\" based on the Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese characters, and Korean, which call it \"Ilbon\" based on the Korean pronunciation of the Chinese characters. Also, while many countries call European cities by their endonym, including \"Roma\", \"Praha\", \"K\u00f6ln\", and \"Napoli\", the English names of many European cities are noticeably different, which are called Rome, Prague, Cologne, and Naples in the same order. These names were borrowed from French. Since French was the official language of England from the Norman invasion to King Henry V, many of the cities names came into English through French."}

{"id": "664258", "revid": "7890056", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=664258", "title": "Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel", "text": "Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (31 October 1875 \u2014 15 December 1950) was a lawyer and influential political leader in the Indian independence movement. After independence, he played an important role in the integration of over 500 princely states into the Indian Union. He was deeply influenced by Gandhi\u2019s ideology and principles, having worked very closely with the leader. Despite being the choice of the people, on the request of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel stepped down from the candidacy of Congress President, which ultimately turned out to be the election to choose the first Prime Minister of independent India. He was the first Home Minister of Independent India and his uncompromising efforts towards consolidation of the country earned him the title \"Iron Man of India\".\nChildhood.\nVallabhbhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875 in Nadiad village of modern day Gujarat to Zaverbai and Ladbai. He belongs to rich class agriculturist Patidar (leva patidar patel) community and Vallabhbhai\u2019s father had served in the army of the Queen of Jhansi, and his mother was a very spiritual woman.\nStarting his academic career in a Gujarati medium school, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel later shifted to an English medium school. In 1897, Vallabhbhai passed his high school and started preparing for law examination. He went to pursue a degree in law and travelled to England in 1910. He completed his law degree in 1913 from Inns of Court and came back to India to start his law practice in Godhra, Gujarat. For his legal proficiency, Vallabhbhai was offered many lucrative posts by the British Government but he rejected all. He was a staunch opponent of the British government and its laws and therefore decided not to work for the British.\nIn 1891, he married Zaverbai and the couple had two children. His daughter, Maniben Patel (1903-1990), was an activist while his son, Dahyabhai Patel (1905-1973) was a member of the parliament of India. \nPatel shifted his practice to Ahmedabad. He became a member of the Gujarat Club where he attended a lecture by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi\u2019s words deeply affected Vallabhbhai and he soon adopted Gandhi\u2019s principles to become a staunch follower of the charismatic leader. That is how deeply Gandhi\u2019s words had affected him. He didn\u2019t know that he would change India and start a successful career.\nRole in the Indian National Movement.\nIn 1917, Sardar Vallabhbhai was elected as the Secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, the Gujarat wing of the Indian National Congress. In 1918, he led a massive \"No Tax Campaign\" that urged the farmers not to pay taxes after the British insisted on tax after the floods in Kaira. The peaceful movement forced the British authorities to return the land taken away from the farmers. His effort to bring together the farmers of his area brought him the title of 'Sardar'. He actively supported the non-cooperation Movement launched by Gandhi. Patel toured the nation with him, recruited 300,000 members and helped collect over Rs.1.5 million.\nIn 1928, the farmers of Bardoli again faced a problem of \"tax-hike\". After prolonged summons, when the farmers refused to pay the extra tax, the government seized their lands in retaliation. The agitation took on for more than six months. After several rounds of negotiations by Patel, the lands were returned to farmers after a deal was struck between the government and farmers\u2019 representatives.\nIn 1930, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was among the leaders who were imprisoned for participating in the famous Salt Satyagraha movement initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. His inspiring speeches during the \"Salt Movement\" transformed the outlook of numerous people, who later played a major role in making the movement successful. He led the Satyagraha movement across Gujarat when Gandhi was under imprisonment, upon request from the congress members. \nSardar Patel was freed in 1931, following an agreement signed between Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India. The treaty was popularly known as the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. The same year, Patel was elected as the President of Indian National Congress in its Karachi session where the party deliberated its future path. Congress committed itself towards the defense of fundamental and human rights. It was in this session that the dream of a secular nation was conceived. \nDuring the legislative elections of 1934, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel campaigned for the Indian National Congress. Though he did not contest, Sardar Patel helped his fellow party mates during the election.\nIn the 1942 Quit India Movement, Patel continued his unwavering support to Gandhi when several contemporary leaders criticized the latter\u2019s decision. He continued travelling throughout the country propagating the agenda of the movement in a series of heart-felt speeches. He was arrested again in 1942 and was imprisoned in the Ahmednagar fort till 1945 along with other Congress leaders.\nSardar Patel\u2019s journey often saw a number of confrontations with other important leaders of the congress. He voiced his annoyance at Jawaharlal Nehru openly when the latter adopted socialism in 1936. Patel was also wary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and considered him to be \"keen on more power within the party\u201d.\nSardar Patel &amp; the Partition of India.\nThe separatist movement lead by Muslim League leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah led to a series of violent Hindu-Muslim riots across the country just before the independence. In Sardar Patel\u2019s opinion, the open communal conflicts incited by the riots had the potential to establish a weak Government at the centre post-independence which will be disastrous for consolidating a democratic nation. Patel went on to work on a solution with V.P. Menon, a civil servant during December 1946 and accepted his suggestion of creating a separate dominion based on religious inclination of states. He represented India in the Partition Council.\nContributions to Post-independence India.\nAfter India achieved independence, Patel became the first Home Minister and also the Deputy Prime Minister. Patel played a very crucial role in post-independence India by successfully integrating around 565 princely states under the Indian Dominion. The British Government had presented these rulers with two alternatives - they could join India or Pakistan; or they could stay independent. This clause magnified the difficulty of process to mammoth proportions. Congress entrusted this intimidating task to Sardar Patel who started lobbying for integration on August 6, 1947. He was successful in integrating all of them barring Jammu and Kashmir, Junagarh and Hyderabad. He eventually dealt with the situation with his sharp political acumen and secured their accession. The India that we see today was a result of the efforts put in by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.\nPatel was a leading member of the Constituent Assembly of India and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was appointed on his recommendation. He was the key force in establishing the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service. He took personal interest in initiating a restoration endeavor of the Somnath Temple in Saurashtra, Gujarat. Patel dealt ruthlessly with the Pakistan\u2019s efforts to invade Kashmir in September 1947. He oversaw immediate expansion of the army and marked improvement of other infrastructural aspects. He often disagreed with Nehru\u2019s policies, especially about his dealings with Pakistan regarding the refugee issues. He organized multiple refugee camps in Punjab and Delhi, and later in West Bengal.\nInfluence of Gandhi.\nGandhi had profound effect on Patel\u2019s politics and thoughts. He pledged unwavering support to the Mahatma and stood by his principles allowed by night at museum and art is the most beautiful woman and through his life. While leaders including Chakravarthy Rajagopalachari and Maulana Azad criticized Mahatma Gandhi's idea that the civil disobedience movement would compel the British to leave the nation, Patel extended his support to Gandhi. Despite the unwillingness of the Congress High Command, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel strongly forced the All India Congress Committee to ratify the civil disobedience movement and launch it without delaying further. Upon Gandhi\u2019s request he gave up his candidacy for the post of the Prime Minister of India. He suffered a major heart attack after Gandhiji\u2019s death. \u00a0Although he recovered, he attributed it to having lamented silently for the loss of his mentor.\nDeath of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel's health started declining in 1950. He relized that he was not going to live much longer. On November 2, 1950, his health became even worse and he had to stay in bed. He died on December 15, 1950 after he had a heart attack. "}

Most of the deaths from this season occurred from Maria, and caused a human crisis in Puerto Rico. In early October, Hurricane Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico while also becoming the fourth hurricane of the year to make landfall in the contiguous United States.

It is long. It is made up of three bridges, one tunnel, and four artificial islands. It is the longest sea crossing on Earth. The bridges cross the Lingdingyang and Jiuzhouyang sea channels. They also connect Hong Kong, Zhuhai, and Macau.\nThe bridge is supposed to last for 120 years. The cost of the bridge was about 126.9 billion yuan ($18.77 billion USD). At first, the cost of the bridge was supposed to be 51.1 billion yuan ($7.56 billion USD). The governments of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, as well as some banks, helped pay for the bridge. The bridge was supposed to open in late 2016, but the bridge only finished being built on 6 February 2018. The bridge officially opened on 24 October 2018.\nPlanning.\nGordon Wu, who was the founder of Hopewell Holdings thought of a bridge and tunnel that would connect China, Hong Kong, and Macau. This was in 1983. He said that he got the idea from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel. After that, in 1988, he showed the ideas to the government in Guangzhou and Beijing. In his idea, the bridge would start more north than the design that was actually built. He wanted the bridge to begin at Black Point near Tuen Mun, Hong Kong. It would then cross the Pearl River passing through Neilingding Island and Qi'ao Island. In his idea, the bridge would end at Tangjia and there would be a road from Zhuhai to Macau. The talks between the government and Wu stopped after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. This is because it made foreign investors concerned.\nThe government of Zhuhai liked this idea and they promoted it. Their name for the bridge was the Lingdingyang Bridge. In the 1990s, Zhuhai built a bridge that connected mainland China and Qi'ao Island. This bridge was supposed to be the first part of the system even though the Chinese and Hong Kong governments did not approve the plan yet. The Chinese government supported the bridge in 1997. The Hong Kong government did not say whether they supported it or not. This is because they were studying traffic between Hong Kong and China and were concerned about the effect this would have on the environment.\nTo begin the project and making sure things were going to go smoothly, the Advance Work Coordination Group of HZMB was created in 2003. People that worked for the governments of Zhuhai, Macau, and Hong Kong worked on planning the bridge, how the border patrol would work, and how the bridge would be paid for.\nIn 2009, the governments of China, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau agreed to pay for 22% of the bridge. The rest of the money, 78%, was paid for by a lot of banks, like the Bank of China.\nConstruction.\nThe construction of the bridge began on 15 December 2009 in China. Li Keqiang held a starting ceremony. Construction began in Hong Kong in 2011. The construction started later because people challenged the building of the bridge.\nThe last bridge tower and part of the tunnel was set up on 12 July 2016. The entire tunnel and bridge was finished in the middle of 2017. The entire project was finished in February 2018.\nParts of the bridge.\nThe entire bridge has three sections. One of them was the Main Bridge, which is and in the middle of the Pearl River. Another was the Hong Kong Link Road, which was and close to Hong Kong. The third section was the Zhuhai Link Road, which was and close to Zhuhai.\nMain Bridge.\nThe Main Bridge is the biggest part of the HZMB project. It was built by the managing people from mainland China.\nProblems.\nNumber of dolphins.\nMany environmentalists said that the bridge will hurt the Chinese white dolphins that live in the Pearl River Delta. They said the construction of the bridge will hurt the dolphins' habitat. These dolphins are endangered animals. In the ten years before the bridge opened, the number of these dolphins dropped over 80%."}

It is celebrated for 5 days. It is celebrated mainly in Nepal and the Indian states of Assam and Sikkim. It is also celebrated in Darjeeling district of West Bengal. It is the festival of lights. In this festival \"diyas\" are lit inside and outside the houses to make it bright at night. It is known as \"Swanti\" among the Newars and as \"Diwali\" among Madhesis. Set in the Vikram Samvat calendar, the festival begins with Kaag Tihar in Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha. It ends with Bhai Tika in Dwitiya of Kartik Sukla Paksha every year.\nTihar is the second biggest festival in Nepal after Dashain. In this festival animals like crows, dogs, cows, and oxen are also worshipped. People make \"Rangolis\" on the floor of living rooms or courtyards. They use materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or flower Petals to make these Rangolis. Rangolis are made for welcoming Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism mainly Goddess Lakshmi.\nKaag Tihar (Day 1).\nKaag Tihar (Crow Festival) is the first day of Tihar. In this day the crow is worshipped. Hindus regard crows as the messengers of Yamraja, the god of death. People worship it to bring good luck in their houses.\nKukur Tihar (Day 2).\nThe second day is called Kukur Tihar (Dog Festival). In this day, people offer garlands, tika and delicious food to dogs. Dogs are important animals in Hindu mythology. It is believed that Bhairava, an incarnation of Lord Shiva, had a dog as a vahana (vehicle). It is also believed that Yama, the god of death, had two guard dogs \u2013 each with four eyes. The dogs are said to watch over the gates of Naraka, the Hindu concept of Hell. Due to this belief, this day is also known as Naraka Chaturdashi.\nGai Tihar and Laxmi Puja (Day 3).\nThe morning of the third day is Gai Tihar (worship of the cow). In Hinduism, cow is the symbol of prosperity and wealth. In ancient times cows were very useful. Their milk, dung, even urine was used for purpose like purification. So, on this day people worship cow by garlanding and feeding them with the best grass. They clean and decorate the houses. Doorways and windows are decorated by garlands made of Saya Patri (marigolds) and makhamali (\"Gomphrena globosa\") flowers.\nIn the evening Laxmi, the goddess of wealth is worshipped. She is worshipped by lighting oil lamps (Diyo) or candles on doorways and windows. It is believed that in this day she visits her followers and gives them blessings. At night the girls enjoy playing \"Bhailo\" by singing and dancing. They visit many houses with musical instruments. They collect money as a tip from houses and share the money amongst themselves.\nFrom the third day onward Tihar is celebrated with \"Deusi\" and \"Bhailo\" with light and fireworks. Boys sing Deusi and the girls sing Bhailo. In return, the home owners give them money, fruit and \"selroti\" (a Nepali roundel made of rice flour and sugar). Social workers, politician, and young people also visit local homes. They sing these songs and collect money for social activities.\nLaxmi Prasad Devkota, who is regarded as the greatest poet of Nepali language, was born on this day. He was named after the Laxmi Puja.\nGovardhan Puja (Day 4).\nThere are 3 different kinds of pujas on the fourth day. Mainly ox is worshipped in this day by giving different foods. It is observed as Goru Tihar or Goru Puja (worship of the oxen). People who follow Vaishnavism perform Govardhan Puja. Govardhan Puja is worship towards Govardhan mountain. Cow dung is taken as representative of the mountain and is worshiped. Another type of puja is Mha Puja (worship of self). It is done by the people of Newar community during the night. This day is seen as the beginning of the new Nepal Sambat calendar year.\nBhai Tika (Day 5).\nThe fifth and last day of Tihar is called \"Bhai Tika\". On this day sisters apply \"tilaka\" or \"tika\" on the foreheads of their brothers. This is done to ensure the long life of their bothers and thank them for the protection they provide. It is believed that, Yamaraj, the God of Death, visited his sister Goddess Yamuna's house. He stayed there for five days so Tihar is also called \"Yamapanchak\". He was pleased with the Hospitality so he asked her to make a wish. Yamuna wished that the love and faith of the brothers and sisters who meet every year on the same day remain strong and the brothers have a long life and fame. Yamaraj granted the wish.\nIn Bhai Tika, brothers sit on the floor while their sisters perform their \"puja\". During the \"puja\" sisters circle brothers by dropping oil on the floor from a copper pitcher. They also applying oil to their brother's hair. After that, they apply seven-color \"tikas\" on the brother's forehead. Similarly, brothers also give \"tikas\" to their sisters. They also exchange gifts. This ritual is practiced for both younger and elder brothers. Those without a sister or brother join relatives or friends for \"tika\". This festival makes the relationship between brothers and sisters stronger.\nAlong with the seven-coloured \"tika\", sisters provide brothers with Sagun, sweets, \"Makhamali\" \"(Gomphrena globosa)\" garland. They also provide a sacred cotton thread of Tantric importance. The thread is similar to Janai and is meant to protect their bodies."}

Soon as the war in Kosovo has ended in 1999 she established the KRCT the same year, just in order to treat survivor victims of torture where she was actively involved in providing medical and psycho-social assistance for the first post-war returnees.\nMs. Rushiti began its work in March 1999, when half of Kosovo\u2019s population fled Kosovo, and mainly where deported to Albania; many of them had suffered from the effects of severe mental and somatic torture and other violations of human rights and other constituted rights enjoying by people\nShe continued in supporting victims of post-war trauma since that time and advocating strongly in promoting and advancing their rights, social inclusion, combating stigmatization, and get recognized by law for this sensitive social group.\nIn its 20 years of work and activity, the primary importance has been dedicated \"to the survivals of wartime sexual violence in Kosovo\". After almost two decades of work and uncompromising engagement of Mrs. Rushiti, survivors of sexual violence have been recognized as a civilian victim of war as a legal status. Exactly, in 2017, its advocacy brought an important government decision to fund personal retirement for survivors of wartime sexual violence in Kosovo.\nSince 2007, within the Human Rights and Advocacy Sector, she has been very active in lobbying, promoting and protecting human rights for persons deprived of their liberty. In this regard, thanks to the contribution and influence of Mrs. Rushiti, the overall treatment situation and the legal framework for persons deprived of their liberty has been promoted and improved.\nFeride Rushiti, as a result of her bold and unremitting commitment in the field of Rehabilitation, Human Rights, Research and Documentation, Advocacy and Lobbying, and Economic Reintegration, in 2018, the US Department of State has awarded the Award International for Courageous Women.\nLife.\nFeride Rushiti is an ethnic Albanian from Gjilan in eastern Kosovo.\nRushiti graduated from the Faculty of Medicine in Tirana in 1997.

She worked with the UN\u2019s children\u2019s agency and with Doctors Without Borders.\nDuring the 1990s, more than half of the population of Kosovo moved out of the country, mostly to Albania, because of the 1998-1999 war and because of many human rights violations. Rushiti formed a group of 45 health professionals from Kosovo to provide medical and psychological support to the refugees. After the war, the refugees returned to Kosovo. This was a new beginning for protection of human rights, especially from torture and other forms of human degradation. In October 1999, Rushiti started the Kosovo Center for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (KRCT), to provide rehabilitation, health care, and psycho-social help for the survivors of torture and violence.\nIn 2014, the parliament passed a law to recognize rape survivors as war victims, so they could receive pensions. In 2018, after more than ten years of advocacy by women's activists, including Feride Rushiti of The Kosovo Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims, they started receiving money. Survivors can receive $280 a month (about 228 Euros)."}

It is not an efficient method of sorting data compared to more advanced algorithms such as quicksort and heapsort. However, it is very simple to build and is usually taught to beginners in computer science.\nSelection sort has a time complexity of O(n2).\nAlgorithm.\nWhen given a list of unsorted data, the algorithm will divide the list into two parts: one part that has all the sorted data and another part that has all the remaining unsorted data. When the algorithm first starts, there is no data in the first part as no data has been sorted yet and all the unsorted data is in the second part. The algorithm then starts to find the smallest item in the unsorted data and swap it with the left-most element of the list. The part with the sorted data is then the left-most element and the part with the unsorted data is the remaining unsorted elements. The algorithm repeats itself, by finding the smallest element within the list of unsorted data and swapping it with the left-most element, eventually getting a sorted data.\nHere is an example of selection sort working on six elements:\nImplementation.\nThe implementation of this algorithm requires using two nested loops. The outer loop is to work on every element in the list starting from the left-most element whereas the inner loop is to find for the smallest element within the unsorted part of the list before the smallest element is swapped with the left-most element.\nA possible way of writing this algorithm in Java is shown below.\npublic static void selectionSort(int[] array) {\n for (int start = 0; start &lt; array.length - 1; start++) {\n int minimumId = start;\n // Find the index of the smallest number\n for (int i = start + 1; i &lt; array.length; i++) {\n if (array[i] &lt; array[minimumId]) {\n minimumId = i;\n // Swap the smallest number with the left-most element\n int temp = array[start];\n array[start] = array[minimumId];\n array[minimumId] = temp;"}

It is one of the 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is in the Siberian area of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Buryatia also shares an international border with Mongolia.\nHistory.\nIn the past, the Buryats were linked and related to the Mongols. It is because of the close distance and trade with each other. They also share a similar culture. Because of this the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols many times. The Xiongnu Empire (209 BC-93 CE), Kublai Khan's Mongol Empire (1206-1368) and the Northern Yuan Empire (1368-1691), were examples when the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols. Other Mongol tribes also lived in Buryatia during that time too. The Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the area of the present-day Buryatia during the 17th century. They came because they were looking for furs and gold. Later during the 1920s, the area was affected by the violence of the Russian Civil War. In 1923, the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed at the end of the civil war to put in place a proper rule. The area changed size and name many times while it was in the Soviet Union. The Buryat ASSR started controlling itself in 1990. This was when the Soviet Union collapsed and Buryatia took on the name Republic of Buryatia in 1992. However, it continued to be a republic in Russia.\nGeography.\nBuryatia is in the south central part of Siberia. Because of this it has a subarctic climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The landscape is mostly mountainous. Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake, is also in Buryatia. There are many animals and birds in the area. These animals and birds may appear depending on the season. The area is also rich in minerals like gold, tungsten, uranium, zinc and more.\nDemographics.\nBuryatia's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time, according to data. It is currently increasing again. A little bit more than half of the population live in cities and towns. Most of the people that live in cities and towns live in the capital, Ulan-Ude. Ethnic Buryats are about one third of the population. Russians mostly make up the other two-thirds of the population. Most ethnic Buryats practice a religion that is mixed with Buddhism and Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature. On the other hand, ethnic Russians mostly practice Orthodox Christianity. Russian is taught and used commonly in Buryatia. But the Buryat language is still taught in some schools and is used mostly at home.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Buryatia mostly relies on farming. This includes the growing of crops and rearing of animals. The mining of minerals contributes to the economy of Buryatia. The building of military equipment and machines also contribute to the economy of Buryatia. Lake Baikal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tourism to Lake Baikal and Buddhist sites are also more areas that have helped the economy.\nPolitics.\nThe Head of Buryatia is the leader of the republic. The Head is chosen by public vote every five years. The People's Khural, is the republic's parliament. The People's Khural lawmakers are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of these lawmakers are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia. The republic was part of the Siberia Federal District before it was transferred to the current Far East Federal District.\nTransportation.\nBuryatia lies along the important Trans-Siberian railway and Trans-Siberian Highway. This railway and road link Moscow with Asia. They also connect Buryatia with the rest of Russia. The republic has several airports, including Baikal International Airport. Flights from these airports link Buryatia to cities further away."}

It is an algorithm that is more efficient than linear search, which will go through every item in the list of items to find a particular item. However, the given list of items must be sorted first before a binary search algorithm can be used.\nThe binary search algorithm works by repeatedly splitting the sorted list into two and working on the part of the list that may contain the item that you are looking for until the final list contains only one item.\nAlgorithm.\nFirst, the algorithm must be given a sorted list and the item to look for, called the target value. The algorithm then compares the middle item of the sorted list with the target value. If the middle item is the same as the target value, then the position of that middle item in the sorted list is returned by the algorithm. If the middle item is larger than the target value, then the algorithm will repeat the previous step, but this time only working on the lower half of the sorted list (where all the items are smaller than the middle item). The same is done if the middle item is smaller than the target value, but the algorithm will repeat the previous step on the upper half of the sorted list (where all the items are larger than the middle item).\nThe position for the middle item is found using the following formula (round down to the nearest whole number):\nformula_1\nAs the algorithm will divide the sorted list into two parts, each iteration thus makes the size of the search smaller by half, which makes it very efficient when searching in a large list of items.\nHere is an example of searching for the number 84 in a list of 9 numbers. The following is a table showing the 9 numbers in increasing order and their list positions:\nThe following is a table showing each step of the binary search algorithm. The middle item in the sorted list is in bold.\nIn this case, position 7 is returned by the algorithm after 3 steps. If the item is not inside the sorted list of items, the binary search algorithm will keep trying until the position of the smallest item is larger than the position of the biggest item before it will return as an unsuccessful search.\nImplementation.\nThe implementation of this algorithm requires using a while loop, which will check if the position of the smallest item is larger than the position of the biggest item. Inside the loop, the algorithm will then check if the middle item is equal to, smaller than or bigger than the target value.\nA possible way of writing this algorithm in Java is shown below.\npublic static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {\n int smallest = 0;\n int biggest = array.length - 1;\n // Make sure that we still have items in the list to search in\n while (smallest &lt;= biggest) {\n int middle = (smallest + biggest) / 2;\n if (array[middle] == target) {\n return middle;\n } else if (array[middle] &gt; target) {\n biggest = middle - 1;\n } else {\n smallest = middle + 1;\n // Return a negative number when we cannot find the target in the array\n return -1;"}

It covers the area of . The area is covered by open grassland, forests, riverbeds and tropical wetlands. It is at an altitude of . It was established in 1976 as \"Royal Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve\". A small part of the reserve is in the northern side of the East-West Highway. It is there to create a path for seasonal Migration of wildlife into the Sivalik Hills. The Syali River forms the eastern boundary of this national park. The international border with India makes the national park\u2019s southern and western boundary.\nThe Indian Tiger Reserve Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary is in the southern part of this reserve. It is a protected area of . It represents the \"Tiger Conservation Unit (TCU) Sukla Phanta-Kishanpur\". It covers a block of alluvial grasslands and subtropical moist deciduous forests.\nThe protected area is part of the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion. It is one of the best-conserved examples of floodplain grassland. It is included in the Terai Arc Landscape.\nHistory.\nThe area was a hunting ground for Nepal's ruling class. It was declared a Royal Hunting Reserve in 1969. In 1973, the area was changed into \"Royal Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve\". At first it had an area of . The area was made bigger to its present size in the late 1980s. A buffer zone of was added in May 2004. In 2017, the status of the protected area was changed to a national park.\nThe name \"Suklaphanta\" comes from one of the grasslands found inside the protected area.\nThe main grassland called \"Sukla Phanta\" is the largest patch of continuous grassland in Nepal. It covers an area of about .\nThe jungles of the Shuklaphanta National Park were once the area of an ancient kingdom. Ruins of that kingdom can still be seen in some places. Near Rani Tal, a lake in the park, a brick girdle is still there. The girdle measures in Circumference. It is considered by locals to be the remains of the fort of Tharu king Singpal.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the region is subtropical monsoonal. The mean annual rainfall in this area is . The rainfall occurs from June to September and is highest in August. The winter months of December and January are fairly cold. The daytime temperatures during this time of year is . Sometimes frost can also be seen. From February onwards temperatures rise up to in March. The temperature reaches upto by end of April. When the first pre-monsoon rains reach the area in May, humidity increases.\nPlants.\nAround 700 species of plants are there in the park. They include 553 vascular plants, 18 pteridophytes, 410 dicots and 125 monocots.\nGrassland covers almost half the reserve's vegetation. The main grass species are \"Imperata cylindrica\" and \"Heteropogon contortus\". khagra reed (\"Phragmites karka\") and \"Saccharum spontaneum\". They grow in the marshes around the seven small lakes. The main forest type is sal. Khair and sissoo grow by the side of rivers. The grassland being covered by trees is a major threat to the long-term existence of the main plants. Trees cover any grasses growing under them, mainly those that need more sunlight. Tree seeds are spread all over the grasslands. They mostly germinate near existing trees. Also, trees help in the growth of shade-loving grasses and prevent the growth of sun-loving species. This process of succession usually converts grassland into woodland over time.\nAnimals.\nThe open grasslands and wetlands covers large area around the lakes. This area is home to different kinds of animals. In the rivers, lakes and ponds 28 fish species and 12 reptile and amphibian species were recorded. recorded. These include mahseer and rohu, mugger crocodile, Indian rock python, monitor lizard, Indian cobra, common krait and Oriental ratsnake.\nMammals.\nCurrent checklists include 46 mammal species. Among them 18 are protected under CITES such as the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, sloth bear, swamp deer, elephant and hispid hare. Great one-horned rhinoceros were moved from Chitwan National Park.\nThe gathering of swamp deer in the park's grasslands is the largest in the world. The population of hispid hare may be of international significance. As of 2013, there were 2170 swamp deer in the reserve.\nIn spring 2016, a rusty-spotted cat was photographed by a camera-trap for the first time in the protected area.\nBirds.\nA total of 423 bird species has been recorded. The park supports the highest population of Bengal floricans in Nepal. It is the western limit of swamp francolin, Jerdon's bushchat, rufous-rumped grassbird, chestnut-capped babbler and Jerdon's babbler. For yellow-eyed babbler it is the north-western limit and it is the eastern limit of Finn's weaver. It is also the most important regular wintering site of Hodgson's bushchat. Forest birds include spot-bellied eagle owl, dusky eagle owl, rufous-bellied eagle and Oriental pied hornbill. The forests are also important for great slaty woodpecker and white-naped woodpecker. The white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture, lesser adjutant, grey-headed fish eagle, darter and rufous-rumped grassbird are breeding residents. Sarus crane, painted stork and bristled grassbird are summer visitors. Greater racquet-tailed drongo, white-capped water redstart, rusty-tailed flycatcher and rufous-gorgeted flycatcher are winter visitors but they are not common.\nDuring a Survey carried out in January 2005, a total of 19 Hodgson's bushchats were recorded. A year later in 2006 only 8 males were recorded."}

{"id": "666025", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666025", "title": "Balikbayan box", "text": " A balikbayan box (literally \"repatriate box\") is a corrugated box filled with items given by Filipinos overseas to their family back home. \nMost of the time the box is sent to its destination by people who work as \"freight forwarders\" who know a lot about shipping balikbayan boxes by sea, the boxes can be brought by Filipinos returning to the Philippines on air flights.\nHistory.\nThe balikbayan box was invented sometime in the 1980s, in the United States because there were a lot of overseas Filipino workers in the country. The first freight forwarder to give balikbayan box services was Rico Nunga who founded REN International in Los Angeles, California in 1981.\nIn 1982, Ramon Ungco, a Filipino living in New York City, founded Port Jersey Shipping International. Many people think these two companies are the \u201cpioneers\u201d of door-to-door delivery of balikbayan boxes, which back then they had to pay import duties when the boxes got into the Philippines.\n On 30 June 1987, the President of the Philippines Corazon Aquino at that time, started Executive Order No. 206. This order changed Section 105 (f) and added a new subsection (f-1) to Republic Act No. 1937, which some people also know as the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, which became law on 22 July 1957 by former president Carlos P. Garcia. \nThe now-changed Section 105 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines gives duty- and tax-free privileges to balikbayan boxes taken to the Philippines by overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in recognition of the large impact of their contribution and sacrifices outside of the Philippines as well as bringing a lot of foreign exchange annually that helped the national recovery effort at that time. \nThis let tax-free entry of personal goods in the country from Filipinos overseas. People then started sending balikbayan boxes through friends and their co-workers who were going back to the Philippines.\nAfter the September 11 attacks in the US and the passage of the Patriot Act by the US Congress, the United States Department of Homeland Security's Out-Bound Exam Team started searching balikbayan boxes.\nIt was so long and strict, the boxes arrived up to three weeks late at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement inspection facility. \nThis made it take longer to get a box through, from 21 days to 30 plus days. The inspections also had balikbayan boxes opened, and people were angry about pilferage and mishandling. The Philippines Bureau of Customs also did 100% inspections which caused the deliveries to arrive really late. \nThe inspections had to happen because of some individuals who use balikbayan boxes to get commercial items through without paying taxes or smuggle contraband. Since balikbayan box shipping is consolidated, even one illegal item will affect all 400 or so items inside the container. The inspection was made better using high performance X-ray machines.\nIn 2012, these delays were made even worse since the City Of Manila decided to stop trucks from driving along the route to and from the Port of Manila, causing long delays in releasing and transporting not only balikbayan boxes but all cargoes, domestic and international. \nMost balikbayan box companies, which are based in Para\u00f1aque City close to the airport, couldn\u2019t operate because of the truck ban until it was settled.\n The industry was scrutinized by the Philippine Senate in 2015 after lots of complaints were brought to the attention of the public through social media after the Philippine Customs Commissioner Albert Lina said that the inspectors would open the balikbayan boxes for inspection and would include more taxes.\n This caused the passage of the Customs Modernization Act, which had been waiting to be passed for years, and also had the Balikbayan Box Law added into the act, increasing the tax-exemption ceiling from PHP 500 (US$9) to PHP 150,000 (US$2,938). This included items being brought home by Filipino tourists from trips abroad, \"pasalubong\" or gifts, and returning resident shipments.\nTo protect consumers, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), using its Philippine Shipper's Bureau, does regular accreditation of international freight forwarders and tells consumers not to use the services of unaccredited and incredibly cheap shipping companies.\n The Door to Door Consolidated Association of the Philippines, says there are 400,000 balikbayan boxes that get into the Philippines every month.\nDescription.\nBalikbayan boxes may have things the sender thinks the recipient wants, regardless of whether the things can be bought in the Philippines, such as non-perishable food, toiletries, household items, electronics, toys, designer clothing, or things hard to find in the Philippines for cheap prices. A balikbayan box meant for airplanes is designed to follow to airline luggage restrictions and many Filipino stores sell them. Some boxes are sold with a cloth cover and side handles. Others are secured with lots of tape or rope, and so, the shippers don\u2019t confuse it with an ordinary moving box that is lightly wrapped. The balikbayan boxes come in three standard sizes which are: \nShipped boxes are taken straight away to the recipient, usually the family of the overseas Filipino.\nCultural significance.\nPart of the attraction of the balikbayan box is because it is important to the economy, which allows cheaper bulk shipment of items versus sending them one at a time or in smaller boxes through postal services. The bad thing though is it takes longer to reach it\u2019s destination by container ship, which most of the time needs several weeks, along with there being no certain delivery date. The balikbayan box is a modern version of the general Philippine practice of \"pasalubong\", where travellers within or outside the country are culturally expected to bring home gifts to family, friends and colleagues. The balikbayan box gives connections between family inside the Philippines and those who are abroad, and give goods to the family within the Philippines."}

However, she was acquitted by the Supreme Court in 2018.\nCase background and Court verdict.\nIn June 2009, while harvesting berries from a field, Asia was seen drinking water from a communal cup by some village women of that area. It was considered offensive by the women due to her religion, and the cup was labelled \"contaminated\". This resulted in an argument between them, and the women accused her of blasphemy.\nIn 2010, a judge in Sheikhupura sentenced Asia to death, which was upheld by the Lahore High Court. Petitions were sent for her release, including one sent by Pope Francis.\nNoreen's husband appealed to the high court. Salman Taseer, the Governor of Punjab, supported Noreen throughout and requested President Asif Ali Zardari to pardon her.\nDue to this support, Taseer was killed by his guard Mumtaz Qadri.\nSeveral appeals were made during this period and the High Court upheld the decision. In October 2014, Lahore High Court rejected her appeal.\nIn November 2014, her lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court.\nOn 31 October 2018, the Supreme Court panel chaired by Justice Saqib Nisar, acquitted Asia Bibi. Although the majority supported the decision, it resulted in protests by the Islamic parties, mainly Tehreek-e-Labaik."}

For example, after the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland joined together in 1701, they formed the United Kingdom. When Ireland joined in 1801, the unified country became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nA second reason is a country splitting apart to form new ones. For example, after Czechoslovakia split in 1992, it became two new countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Also, after Ireland gained independence from Britain, the region of Northern Ireland stayed in the UK. Therefore, the country's name changed from United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to what it is today, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nA third reason could be a new government replacing or overthrowing the old one. After the Communist Party took overthrew the Russian Empire's emperor, the Tsar, and changed the country's name to the Soviet Union, the city of Saint Petersburg also changed to Leningrad. This was because the Communist Party wanted to honor its leader, Vladimir Lenin, and symbolize the Soviet Union's turning away from Russia's system of absolute monarchy, the Tsardom, that ruled before they did, since Saint Petersburg was named after Peter the Great, who was the Tsar that founded the city. When the city of New Amsterdam, founded by Dutch colonists in North America, was lost to the British Empire, it was renamed New York City after the Duke of York.\nA fourth reason could be changing a place's name to replace a name given by former colonizers with the name given by native people, and many more. For example, after India gained independence from Britain, they changed the name of the city Bombay to Mumbai.\nA fifth reason could be the change of standard spelling rules in the local language. When Pinyin was made the official romanization, or writing Mandarin Chinese using the Roman alphabet, in mainland China after the Chinese Communist Party took over, the spellings of many Chinese place names changed, including Peking becoming Beijing and Nanking becoming Nanjing. Even though the pronunciations of Chinese place names in Mandarin Chinese were not any different before the changing of spelling, the older spellings did not accurately show their pronunciation. Therefore, the pronunciation of Chinese place names in other languages, or their exonyms, were based on their spelling rather than the Mandarin pronunciation, which is why they sound so different from each other. In order to teach people how to correctly pronounce Mandarin Chinese, the CCP made Hanyu Pinyin the only accepted romanization in mainland China. Even though Taiwan also speaks Mandarin, the spellings of Taiwanese place names, including Taipei and Kaohsiung, is according to the older spelling rules for Chinese place names. This is because many Taiwanese do not want to use Hanyu Pinyin, even though it is the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese worldwide, because it was created by the Communist Party of China."}

{"id": "666175", "revid": "495413", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666175", "title": "Chinese place names", "text": "Chinese place names are the names of places in China. Since the Chinese language has not had any sort of phonetic alphabet until only about a few hundred years ago (compared to the thousands of years the Chinese characters have been used), there has been a lot of confusion on naming places in Chinese. Since Chinese characters are a logographic writing system, meaning that the writing mainly shows the words' meaning rather than its pronunciation, it can be used to write down words in many different languages. On top of all this, the Chinese language is not one unified language, but an entire branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Many of the Chinese languages or dialects are mutually unintelligible, which means a speaker of one language or dialect cannot understand a speaker of another unless one of them already knew the other's language or dialect. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are both dialects of Chinese, but they are so different from each other than their speakers cannot understand the other unless at least one speaker knew both. Therefore, knowing which spoken dialect to use when writing out the name in the Roman alphabet, which is a phonetic writing system and not a logographic one, can be challenging. For example, while the name of the city is written as \u5317\u4eac in Chinese, it is called \"B\u011bij\u012bng\" in Mandarin and \"Bak1 Ging1\" in Cantonese.\nIn mainland China, most place names are in Mandarin Chinese, the country's official spoken language. Even though the sounds of Mandarin Chinese have not changed for a long time, there were many different ways to write Chinese place names in Mandarin using the Roman alphabet, or many different kinds of romanizations. This created a lot of confusion and misinformation for non-Chinese speakers on what to call Chinese place names. For example, Beijing was spelled Peking, Nanjing was called Nanking, Tianjin was spelled Tiantsin, and Qingdao was spelled Tsingtao. These many spelling systems caused confusion among non-Chinese speakers and therefore whatever name speakers of other languages called place names ended up sounding very different from Mandarin Chinese. In order to teach people how to correctly pronounce Mandarin Chinese, to mainland Chinese and non-Chinese alike, the Chinese Communist Party made Hanyu Pinyin the only accepted romanization in official use and banned all other romanizations in official use in mainland China. Peking became Beijing, Nanking became Nanjing, Tiantsin became Tianjin, and Tsingtao became Qingdao. While the pronunciation of these place names stayed the same in Mandarin, it allowed non-Chinese speakers, especially English speakers, to say Chinese place names much more accurately to their Mandarin pronunciations.\nHowever, in the autonomous regions, places in China where certain minority groups make up a large part of the region's population, many place names changed back from Chinese to the local languages in order to represent the local languages. For example, the city of Dihua (\u8fea\u5316) was changed back to Urumqi, which is the name of the city in the local Uyghur language, after the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was formed.\nIn Taiwan, where Mandarin Chinese is also the official language, the spelling of place names tends to be inconsistent. The names of Taiwanese cities are usually in Chinese postal romanization. This is why the cities are spelled Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taichung instead of Taibei, Gaoxiong, and Taizhong, which is how they would be spelled in Hanyu Pinyin. This is the case because many Taiwanese dislike using Hanyu Pinyin (even though it is the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese worldwide) because it was created by the Chinese Communist Party, which many Taiwanese do not like. While within northern Taiwanese cities most names of streets, districts, and subway stops are in Hanyu Pinyin (since Hanyu Pinyin is generally more accepted in the north), cities in southern Taiwan use many different spelling systems simply to resist using Hanyu Pinyin. In several cases, the exact same street can be spelled several different ways. For example, in Banqiao, Xinzhan Road (\u65b0\u7ad9\u8def) is spelled \"Shinjann Rd.\" on one section and \"Sin Jhan Rd.\" on another."}

{"id": "666371", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666371", "title": "Chukotka Autonomous Okrug", "text": "The Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is the farthest east of all 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Chukotka also shares an international sea border with Alaska of the United States.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times, the present area of Chukotka was joined with North America by a land bridge known as Beringia. It was believed that humans first migrated to the Americas using this route. Later, the area was home to the Chukchi people and other natives. Some of these natives are related to the Inuit. By the 17th century, the Russians first arrive to gain control of the natives. At first, not much attention was given to the remote land of Chukotka. But its natural resources and the ability to use the area to attack land further away was soon discovered. The Russians then made multiple attempts to bring the natives under their control by force. However, these attempts failed. The Russians finally made peace with the Chukchis in 1778. Through the 19th and 20th centuries, other foreign powers also attempted to claim the land and resources in the region. They were instead driven away by the Russians. The Russians were increasingly worried about their presence. During the Soviet Union, the natives were brought under state's control and made to resettle. Multiple gulags were also built in the area. Tin and much later gold was mined from the area after the start of World War II. The tin and gold were used to supply the war efforts. In 1991, at the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chukotka declared its separation to become a subject of Russia. It continues to remain as an autonomous okrug till today.\nGeography.\nChukotka is the eastern most point of Russia and mainland Asia. It is separated from Alaska, United States, by the Bering Strait and the International Date Line. Chukotka is found in the north-eastern part of Siberia. Because of this it has a polar tundra climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The ground is mostly frozen as well. The landscape is mostly barren, with limited animals and plants. The area however is rich in minerals. The Wrangel Island found north of Chukotka is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nDemographics.\nChukotka's population has been decreasing since the end of the Soviet Union according to data. About 65% of the population live in cities and towns. Ethnic Chukchis compose of roughly a third of the population. Russians make up about half the population. People of other local ethnicity make up the rest of the population. Most Chukchis either practice Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, or Orthodox Christianity. Russian is taught and used commonly in Chukotka. The Chukchi language usage is decreasing and is used mostly at home. There are currently attempts to make it popular again.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Chukotka is mostly reliant on mining of minerals, like coal, gold, natural gas and oil. Most of Chukotka's population take jobs under big companies that are involve in mining. The rest of the rural population continue to practice reindeer herding, whale hunting, and fishing. The growing of crops and rearing of animals are mostly not possible because of the climate. Besides that, sea trade via the Northern Sea Route is expected to improve the economy. This sea route is expected to become ready in the future.\nPolitics.\nThe Governor of Chukotka is the leader of the okrug. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Duma of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, is the okrug's parliament. The Duma members of parliament are chosen similarly by the public every five years. There are now 15 members of parliament. The majority of these lawmakers in the Duma are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia part is the ruling party of Russia. Roman Abramovich, a former governor of Chukotka, is famous for being the owner of Chelsea Football Club. He has donated more than US$2.5 billion to build schools, hospitals and buildings in Chukotka.\nTransportation.\nChukotka does not have railroads or many roads, making travel difficult. Most long-distance travel is by sea or air. The okrug has several airports, such as the Ugolny Airport. However, there are no international flights. Special permits are needed to enter Chukotka because the area is along an international border."}

He is a talking hand puppet with eyes. He is the grandpa of the main character, Oobi. He was made by Josh Selig and first showed on TV in 2000. The person who played the role of Grampu was Tyler Bunch, an actor who works with puppets.\nRole.\nGrampu is an old man. He lives with his two grandkids, Oobi and Uma. Their parents and grandma are never seen or talked about, so Grampu is the only one who takes care of them. He likes to teach them about the world. He shows them how to do new things. As a running gag (repeated joke) in the show, Grampu is very unlucky and usually has to clean up messes that the kids make.\nGrampu's favorite things to do are cooking and growing plants in his garden. When he is in the kitchen, he wears a big chef's hat and an apron. He is in love with Inka, an old woman from France who is Oobi's piano teacher. Grampu and Inka like to go on dates and eat fancy food.\nGrampu has hazel eyes and doesn't wear any clothes. His hand is in a different position from the other characters. His fingers are curled in a fist instead of being extended, making him taller and giving him a toothless look.\nCreation.\nGrampu was made by Josh Selig, the maker of the whole show. Josh Selig wanted to show a non-traditional family: a family that was different from most ones shown on TV. This is why he came up with the idea for Oobi and Uma to live with their single grandpa.\nIn the first episodes of \"Oobi\", which were short two-minute stories, Grampu was a secondary character who did not show up very much. When the show was turned into a longer half-hour program, Grampu got a bigger role. The show writers used him as a (a contrasting character) to the kids, or as someone to give them advice. Grampu appeared more than he used to, and he was part of almost every single episode.\nThe person who played the role of Grampu was Tyler Bunch. Bunch is a puppeteer (an actor who works with puppets) known from the show \"Sesame Street\". While he was playing the part of Grampu, Bunch had to never shave his arm, so that Grampu would look like an old, hairy man. This was different from the other actors, who all had to shave their arms because they played kid characters. Bunch had a manicurist who filed his nails every week during filming.\nReception.\nGrampu has gotten a good reception from viewers and critics. Many parents who watched \"Oobi\" with their kids thought he was the funniest part of the show. In an interview, Josh Selig said \"many mothers seem to have developed a 'thing' for Grampu.\" , a writer of comedy books, called him \"a hilarious character\" in his book \"Alternadad\". He also wrote that Grampu seemed like a \"children's TV character with whom we could spend an afternoon if [he] magically came to life.\"\nThe newspaper \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" included Grampu as a good example of an unusual family unit in children's TV. In a satirical article that made fun of people wanting to keep gay and single parents out of media for kids, the newspaper called attention to Grampu being a single stay-home parent with a foreign girlfriend (Inka).\nOther media.\nGrampu has appeared in media outside of the \"Oobi\" show. From 2006 to 2013, toy versions of Grampu's puppet eyes (made of the material acrylic) were sold on an online shopping site called OobiEyes.com. They were available in different sizes for kids' and adults' hands.\nIn 2007, Grampu appeared several times on a talk show called \"\" when it featured clips from \"Oobi\". They were shown in a part called \"What the Kids Are Watching\", when the host Joel McHale made comments about funny scenes from kids' shows. Grampu also appeared in a video by the YouTube star Shane Dawson in November 2009, when he imitated Oobi and Grampu with his own hands.\nIn \"Oobi: Dasdasi\", a spin-off of the original \"Oobi\" show made in 2012, Grampu was reimagined as \"Grandpa\", a new character with a similar role."}

It has two levels. The top level is a road for cars, buses, and trucks. There is also a sidewalk for people on foot. That part is 4588 meters or 15,052 feet long. The bottom level is a railroad for trains. That part is 6772 meters or 22,218 feet long.\nIt is owned, paid for, and fixed by Nanjing's government and by the Shanghai Railway Bureau.\nName.\nThe Mandarin Chinese name of the bridge is \"N\u00e1nj\u012bng Ch\u00e1ngji\u0101ng D\u00e0qi\u00e1o\", which means \"the Big Bridge across the Long River in the Southern Capital\". (\"Ch\u00e1ngji\u0101ng\" or \"Long River\" is the Chinese name for the Yangtze River, and \"Nanjing\" means \"Southern Capital\".) It is written in the traditional characters used by Chinese people on Taiwan and in Hong Kong and in the simplified characters used by mainland China.\nHistory.\nThe Yangtze River is very big and very wide. During wars, people sometimes made pontoon bridges out of many boats. Most of the time, to go from one side to the other, people needed to use a ferry. This made things pretty slow and slowed the growth of China's economy.\nThe Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was started in 1960. Both parts were finished and opened for use in late 1968. It was the 3rd bridge across the Yangtze River, after Wuhan's bridge and the Baishatuo Bridge near Chongqing. It is still important and a landmark in Nanjing because it was the first big bridge designed and built completely by Chinese people. It also has poems and sayings by Mao Zedong and art from the Cultural Revolution.\nIt is also infamous as the place with the most known suicides in the world. More than 2000 people have jumped off of the bridge since it was opened.\nTransport.\nThe road across the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is National Highway 104. The same road is also part of highways 205 and 312.\nThe railroad across the bridge is the Beijing\u2013Shanghai Railway. (This is the railroad for slow trains. The high-speed trains between Beijing and Shanghai use a different bridge.) The same railroad is also part of the Nanjing\u2013Xi'an and Nanjing\u2013Qidong Railways. It is also used for the Shanghai\u2013Chengdu High-Speed Railway, but those trains can't go very fast across the bridge.\nArt.\nThe bridge was constructed under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. It is covered with his sayings and calligraphy (artistic handwriting). It also has statues and pictures of strong and passionate soldiers, workers, and farmers that go along with what the words say. There are also pictures of China's growing industry."}

It is operated by the Guangzhou Metro Corporation. It was the fourth metro system that was built in mainland China. The Guangzhou Metro was planned many times. The planning of the metro began in the 1980s and in 1993 the construction of the first line began. In 1997 the metro opened. The first line was Line 1.\nThe metro system has 13 lines. They are Line\u00a01, Line\u00a02, Line\u00a03, Line\u00a04, Line\u00a05, Line\u00a06, Line 7, Line\u00a08, Line 9, Line 13, Line 14, Guangfo Line, and the Zhujiang New Town APM. All of these lines connect the urban core and the suburbs. The Guangfo Line connects Guangzhou and Foshan. Over seven million people ride the metro everyday and it was used 2.56 billion times. This makes the metro the fourth busiest metro in the world.\nHistory.\nFirst ideas and planning.\nChen Yu, who was the Governor of Guangdong from 1957 to 1967, first had an idea for a metro system in Guangzhou. In 1960 he had the groundwater levels of Guangzhou checked. In 1965 Chen Yu and Tao Zhu put out the idea to build a tunnel in Guangzhou for evacuations during war or for creating a metro. The project was called \"Project Nine\".\nThe metro system was supposed to have two lines. Chen Yu planned for a north-south line and an east-west line. The plans for these lines are very similar to Line 1 and Line 2. The east-west line was never built. The north-south line was supposed to be built by Project Nine. There wasn't enough time, money, or materials so instead of having a subway, they planned to use trolleybuses. The tunnel was finished in 1966 but it could not be used. This was because there was an unsafe section of the tunnel. There were many attempts to restart Project Nine in the 1970s, but none of these attempts restarted Project Nine.\nConstruction of Line 1.\nThe metro project was started as the Preparation Office of Guangzhou Metro. It was created in 1979 to try and restart Project Nine. The project was going to help reduce the traffic in Guangzhou. Before the 1980s, most underground projects in China were to prepare for war. This was the first time that something like the Guangzhou Metro was focused on traffic. China and France worked together to design the metro. Four designs were released in the Guangzhou Daily on 14 March 1988. One of the designs were chosen after getting feedback from other people. It showed a design that would become Line\u00a01 and Line\u00a02.\nThe construction of Line\u00a01 officially began on 28 December 1992. Before that, in October 1992, workers began on a trial part of the line. Many construction techniques were used when building the metro. They were new to China and included immersed tubes and tunnel boring machines. Line 1 needed \u00a512.75\u00a0billion to be built and the city government of Guangzhou raised all the money. The mayor at the time, Li Ziliu wanted to use cut-and-cover tunnels. This meant that almost 100,000 people had to leave their homes and almost of buildings had to be destroyed.\nOn 28 June 1997 the section of Line\u00a01 opened for a trial. The part that was not opened was finished on 28 December 1998. The whole line was opened for sightseeing between 16 February and 2 March 1999. Line\u00a01 was officially opened on 28 June 1999."}

It is in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayas. Pumori lies just eight kilometres west of Mount Everest. Pumori means \"the Mountain Daughter\" in Sherpa language. It was named by George Mallory. \"Pumo\" means young girl or daughter and \"Ri\" means mountain in Sherpa language. Climbers sometimes refer to Pumori as \"Everest's Daughter\". Mallory also called it Clare Peak, after his daughter.\nPumori is a popular climbing peak. The easiest route is graded class 3, but avalanche is still a danger. Pumori was first climbed on May 17, 1962 by Gerhard Lenser on a German-Swiss expedition. Two Czechs (Leopold Sulovsk\u00fd and Zden\u011bk Michalec) climbed a new route on the south face in the spring of 1996.\nAn outlier of Pumori is Kala Patthar (5,643m/18,513'). It appears as a brown bump below the south face of Pumori. Many trekkers going to see Mount Everest up close will try to climb to the top of Kala Patthar.\nTrekking and mountaineering.\nNearly 500 people had reached the summit of Pumori by 2005. 42 (13 after reaching the summit) people lost their lives while climbing by 2005. It's popularity increased by 2008. From the summit, high Tibetan plateau can be seen on the one side and Nepal can be seen on the other side. The western part of the Everest can also be seen from the summit. However, there have been some dangers from avalanches. Some Spanish climbing teams took heavy losses (such as in 1989 and 2001). 2015 avalanche killed and injured many people. It was likely caused by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. It is said to have started from the Pumori-Lingtren ridge.\nIn 1982 a group climbing to Pumori also did a ski-hike around Everest. Jim Bridwell led the climbing expedition to Pumori."}

Davis' had six major collections, the last shown at Manhattan restaurant Caffe Roma.\nBeginnings.\n\"Karl Davis\" \u201cDesigner Files\u201d archival materials at Fashion Institute of Technology\u2019s research library reveal that during his teen years Davis was taught by a friend\u2019s mother how to operate a sewing machine, and that when he was fifteen years old, he for the first time made classic, pleated slacks for himself. Davis graduated from high school in August 1980. At age 17, he left Brooklyn and began designing.\nDavis attended New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology for only one semester - six months - and while there studied pattern making. He then worked as an assistant to Carol Fertig and, too, as a freelance design assistant to Bill Blass. It was while Davis was working as design assistant that he sold first styles to Henri Bendel.\nDuring 1984, Davis established his own collection. Initially, he was financed by his supportive, fashionable mother - Rose.\nFashion Designer.\nThough brief \u2013 from age 17 until shortly before his death at age 25 \u2013 Karl Davis experienced a career highly praised and of impressive achievement\n\"Newsweek\" (10 August 1987) observed that Davis created an exclusive line of classic women\u2019s clothing, which \"New York Newsday\" (4 May 1986) described as grown-up clothes not for those on a tight budget.\n\"New York Magazine\" {17 September 1987} stated that ladies dressed in Davis-designed wardrobes would look \u201cstrong, confident, and elegant \u2013 not to mention, in many instances, frankly sexy\u201d.\nFashion columnists of the \"Dallas Morning News\" (18 December 1985) reported that Davis\u2019s work was strongly influenced by the great masters of couture, but that he managed to move forward, adding his own signature of modern minimalism; further stating that his approach to fashion and to his business were in remarkable contrast to his age.\n\"Taxi\" (November 1986) commented that being young and having no financial backing did not intimidate Davis from creating couture clothing of the highest level; that respect should be paid to him and fashion magazine should acknowledge him and take the initiative to put him on the map; and also that a lady dressed in Davis\u2019s clothes would not only be taken seriously, but would be praised for her good taste and silent elegance - daring to detach herself from the uniforms of a working machine. \"Taxi\" quoted Davis: \u201cI love what I\u2019m doing \u2013 making women look like women again! The lady I sell to is dressed femininely and still gains respect on a business level.\u201d \"Taxi\" further observed that a customer from Henri Bendel would never suspect that the dress she just purchased was from a young designer who supported himself by making bagel sandwiches in a downtown coffee shop.\nTrue, Davis did prepare sandwiches at \u201cTamala Designs With Bagel\u201d [153 Prince Street], a SoHo clothing store with food counter in the back owned by Aggie Markowitz who reflected \"[Karl] was an integral part of the downtown fashion mafia. He gave fashion commentary while he sort of made bagel sandwiches. The commentary usually came faster than the food\".\n\"Taxi\" (November 1986) quoted Davis: \u201cMost people would rather spend money on flashy clothes that scream and spell \u2018expensive\u2019, rather than purchasing understated elegant garments\".\n\"Pr\u00eat\" (May 1986) said Davis was beginning to shake up the New York fashion scene with his elegant, dramatic cuts and sophisticated sense of style, that his designs were Inspired by the looks of Dior, Balenciaga and Chanel; and that he took a modern approach to the values and attitudes of Haute Couture and reinvented them for a new, younger generation. \"Pr\u00eat\" additionally observed that Davis chose to work with very basic shapes and inject something hidden or unexpected into them which he described as \u201cclassic with a twist\u201d; that he focused primarily on playing up and enhancing the feminine form; and that to further emphasize his attention to shape, he - with a keen focus on the waist and hips for both day and evening wear - tended to stay away from loud prints and patterns and designs.\nDuring December 1985, Davis found a backer and also was able to travel to Europe \u2013 both having significant impact on his May 1986 showing \u201cKarl Davis Fall 1986 Collection\u201d.\n\"New York Newsday\" (24 August 1986) declared Davis to be \u201cNew York\u2019s new crown prince of near couture\u201d.\n\"Karl Davis\" designs - priced at $80 to $500 wholesale - were sold In New York at Henri Bendel [which continued to be his major outlet], Bergdorf Goodman, Grand Hotel, Le Piccole, and Suzie's [Great Neck, NY]; in Dallas and Houston at Neiman Marcus; and in San Francisco at I.

He is very fond of fashion: it\u2019s as if he was born to enjoy wearing clothes. The clothes he wears are not shockingly avant-garde or showy. Karl is a unique dresser whose taste is classic, as well as modern, neat and refined. He creates his tasteful and sophisticated look by skillfully combining brand name clothes, antiques, and ordinary garments.\u201d\nTrue to his nature, Davis in1980 was voted \u201cBest Dressed Male\u201d of his George-Wingate-High-School [Brooklyn, NY] graduating class.\nIllness and Death.\nOn 2 May 1987, Karl Davis died of pneumonia at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY. Davis\u2019s death was due to complications from HIV/AIDS. Along with fellow-designers Perry Ellis, Chester Weinberg, Willi Smith, Tracy Mills and Mark Pennywell, reporter Carol Hymowitz in her \"Wall Street Journal\" (8 December 1987) article \"Designer Deaths: AIDS Is Decimating The Fashion Business . . .\" cites \", , , budding talent Karl Davis, who created a line of classic women's clothing . . .\" as among the enormous toll of other talents in the fashion business succumbing to an alarming surge in HIV/AIDS-related casualties.\nFuneral services for Davis were held 7 May 1987 at St. Mary\u2019s Church of Christ in Brooklyn, NY, followed by interment also in Brooklyn at Cypress Hills Cemetery.\nKarl Davis was survived by his parents, Rose and Lembert Davis of Brooklyn, and three sisters, Jackie and Robin, both of Brooklyn, and Andora Boyd of Virginia."}

It multiplies rapidly, needing only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.\nMany people believe \"Chlorella\" can serve as a possible source of food and energy. This is because its photosynthesis process can, in theory, reach 8% efficiency. This is even better than that of other highly efficient crops such as sugar cane, which are already being used for food and energy.\nIn 1961, Melvin Calvin of the University of California received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the pathways of carbon dioxide assimilation using \"Chlorella\".\nChlorella reproduce asexually by aplanospores.

It is also known as the because it is also a memorial hall to remember the many Chinese people who were killed during the massacre by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nHistory.\nNanjing (then spelled \"Nanking\" in English) was China's capital city during the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, Japan was an empire that included Korea and Taiwan. During the 1930s, Japan started the Second Sino-Japanese War and tried to take over all of China. This became part of World War II, as Japan's friend Germany took over Poland and Italy joined their wars and started some of its own. When the Japanese army got to Nanjing in December 1937 and January 1938, it did not only fight the Chinese army; it also killed many other people who were not fighting at all. It also committed many, many war crimes against the people in the city. It is even hard to count how many people were killed or hurt in all, because the Japanese treated the bodies and the people so badly. The Chinese government says 300,000 people were killed and more were hurt.\nTo remember the people who were killed and hurt and to fight Japanese people who say nothing very bad happened in Nanjing, the city government built the Nanjing Massacre Museum in 1985. In 1995, with the city growing richer from China's Opening-Up Policy, the museum was made larger and better.\nGrounds.\nThe memorial (place to remember something) consists of three major parts: a museum that shows historical records and other things from the massacre, an outdoor area, and a covered area that holds the bones of many of the people who died in the massacre. The building has about 3,000 square meters or 32,000 square feet of floor space. The rest of the museum covers another 25,000 square meters or 6 acres of land around the building. The memorial uses architecture, sculptures, and videos to show what happened during the Nanjing Massacre.\nVisiting.\nAdmission to the Nanjing Massacre Museum is free. It is open from 8:30 to 4:30 from Tuesday to Sunday. The museum is closed every Monday.\nYou can go there by taking the underground or by buses."}

It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too.\nHistory.\nLocal Koryak people lived in the region for a long time before European explorers first arrived. They were described to be war-like. In the 17th century, Russian explorers first arrived in the area. But the area's harsh climate, land and unfriendly natives made exploration difficult. Multiple fighting later broke out between the natives and the Russians throughout the 18th century. This was because the Tsar ordered more Russian explorations of the area. In 1768-1769, the smallpox disease nearly wiped out the population. The natives were finally brought under control because of the disease. In 1854, the area saw fighting between the Russians and the British and French during the Crimean War. In 1867, after the sale of Alaska to the United States, Kamchatka loss its importance. It was because travelers were no longer stopping over the area to go to Alaska. During the last months of World War II, the area became an important point for Soviet troops to invade Japan. After the war the area became a military zone. This zone was closed off to Soviet citizens till 1990 and foreigners till 1991. Today it remains as a Krai (federal subject) within Russia.\nGeography.\nKamchatka is found in the far eastern part of Siberia. Because of this, it has a subarctic climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. Rainfall in the area is unusually higher than the rest of Eastern Siberia. This is because westerly winds blow in from the Sea of Japan. The landscape is mostly mountainous, with the Sredinny Mountain Range occupying a large part of the region. The Sredinny Range has the most amount of glacier in North-East Asia. The area also has a high density of mountains that are active volcanoes. These volcanoes are included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area is prone to volcano eruption and earthquake. This is because it lies around the Pacific Ring of Fire. There are plenty of animals, birds and plants in the area. It is because of the good climate, geography and low human population.\nDemographics.\nKamchatka's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time, according to data. It is currently increasing again. Most of the population live in cities and towns, like the capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Ethnic Koryaks and other natives compose of a very small percentage of the population. Russians compose a great majority of the population. Most people in Kamchatka practice Orthodox Christianity, while a sizable population are irreligious. Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, is still practiced by some natives in the area. Russian is taught and used commonly in Kamchatka. While native languages like Koryak, Itelmen or Chuvan are hardly taught or used at home.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Kamchatka is mostly based on fishing and processing of natural resources. These resources include wood, coal and gold, involving the lumber and mining industries. Kamchatka lies along major shipping routes. It thus provide services such as ship building, repairing and the moving of goods among ships. In the past, Kamchatka was part of the region's fur trade. This fur trade was connected with places like China and Alaska.\nPolitics.\nThe Governor of Kamchatka is the leader of the Krai. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Kamchatka Legislative Assembly, is the Krai's parliament. The Legislative Assembly lawmakers are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Legislative Assembly are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia. The Krai was formed on 1 July 2007 from the merge between Kamchatka Oblast and Koryak Autonomous Okrug.\nTransportation.\nGenerally, Kamchatka is isolated from the rest of Russia. There are no railway and road linking it with the rest of Russia. Flying is the most convenient way of entering or leaving Kamchatka. There are several airports, like the Yelizovo Airport. Flights from these airports link Kamchatka to cities further away. However, there are no international flights into the area. Kamchatka also lies along major shipping routes. These shipping routes connect Kamchatka with Alaska and East Asia by sea."}

{"id": "667787", "revid": "7691524", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=667787", "title": "Double-layer capacitance", "text": "Double-layer capacitance is the storing of electrical energy by means of the electrical double layer effect.\nDouble layer capacitance is when an electrode and a liquid solution are touching each other, causing the charges to line up and allowing electricity to be stored there. The double layer is created when the electrode\u2019s surface is charged through the application of electricity. This causes oppositely charged molecules to be attracted to the surface (since opposites attract). This first layer is well attached to the electrode surface, causing it to be semi-permanent. The second layer (with opposite charge) is held by this first layer, making it less attached to the electrode than the first layer. These two layers are separated by a single atomic layer of uncharged molecules in the solution. These alternating layers of charges have the ability to store electrical energy, in a way that depends on the amount of electricity initially applied to the electrode. Once this charge is stored in the device, the source of electricity can be removed and the circuit can still be powered from this stored electricity contained in this device, until it is used up.\nThe amount of electric charge stored in double-layer capacitance is linearly proportional to the applied voltage. It depends mainly on the electrode surface. The unit of capacitance is the farad.\nCapacitance Basics.\nA capacitor is a very common electrical circuit device that can store electrical energy as charge. It works based on the idea that you can have a separation between two conductive plates and store a charge on the surface of these plates. However, if too much electricity is stored in the plates, it can jump across the gap causing less energy to be stored. The amount of charge stored in the capacitor can be increased by putting a dielectric material between the plates; air plays this role if no other material is present. This helps to prevent the charge from crossing the gap between the two electrodes, which allows more charge to be stored in this manner. \nCapacitance in Solution.\nBy using a solution instead of the dielectric material, more energy can be stored within the device. When the capacitor becomes charged, the positively charged molecules in the solution become attracted to the negatively charged electrode (and opposite for the positively charged electrode). These positively charged molecules then become attached to the surface of the electrode, and pull in negatively charged molecules from the solution to form a spherical shape; however, these molecules are not attached as strongly. These two layers in the solution prevent the similar charges from pushing each other apart as much leading to an increase in the amount of charge the device can store. In experiments, it has been seen that there is a voltage drop across this layer, which works in the same way as a capacitor. This led to the first use of the term \"electrical double layer\" in the 1850s by Helmholtz and later being changed to \"electrical double layer capacitance\" (EDLC). Since this double layer capacitance happens at both electrodes, the theoretical capacitance of the entire device can be raised substantially. However, there are several other factors which can come into play, causing the actual capacitance of the device to not see as much benefit as expected.\nDouble Layer Capacitance Applications.\nWhen the double layer capacitance idea is used to create a device, they are sometimes called \"ultracapacitors\" because they store energy by separating the charges (like a capacitor but capable of storing more energy), instead of using a chemical reaction to store electricity. This means that the devices can work correctly for a much longer period of time and charging a device like this takes less time than charging a traditional battery. However, the solution will dry up over time, causing the device to eventually fail. Currently there are several devices that use this technology, including: wireless modems, GPS devices, CMOS computer chips, solar battery operated chips, windmills, electric cars, and power tools.\nThe electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) has the ability to power a device for longer than a traditional capacitor, but cannot give as much instant energy as the traditional capacitor, which can discharge all at once. Rechargeable batteries can power a device for longer than the EDLC per charge, but cannot deliver as much instant energy."}

Whole trusses of fruits should be cut instead of individual fruit, and then either used, or they can be stored in a fridge. They can also be bagged and frozen.\nVarious forms are known including; 'White Grape', 'Blanka' and 'Versailles Blanche' (syn \u2018White Versailles\u2019), and 'White Pearl'.\nThe cultivar 'White Grape' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. There are also cultivars with yellow and pink fruit, called respectively yellow currants and pink currants.\nThe bushes can suffer from pests such as gooseberry sawfly and birds.\nCulinary uses.\nWhite currant berries are slightly smaller and sweeter than red currants. When made into jams and jellies the result is normally pink. The white currant is actually an albino cultivar of the red currant but is marketed as a different fruit.\nWhite currants are rarely specified in savoury cooking recipes compared with their red counterparts. They are often served raw and provide a sweetly tart flavor. White currant preserves, jellies, wines and syrups are also produced. In particular, white currants are the classic ingredient in the highly regarded Bar-le-duc or Lorraine jelly although preparations made of red currants can also be found.\nThe berries are a good source of vitamins C and K, and are rich in iron, copper and manganese."}

Ring-necked snakes live in eastern and central North America. There are many colors and patterns of ring-necked snake. It is called the ring-necked snake because it has a stripe around its neck that looks like a ring. \nRing-necked snakes live in the United States, central Mexico, and southeastern Canada. Ring-necked snakes are nocturnal, which means that they are awake at night. Ring-necked snakes are a little venomous, but they do not hurt people. This is because they are small and do not bite people much. When ring-necked snakes are scared, they curl up their tails. \nScientists think that there are many ring-necked snakes. Scientists do not know exactly how many ring-necked snakes there are. This is because scientists have not studied ring-necked snakes very much. \nRing-necked snakes are the only species of snake in their genus. There are 14 subspecies of ring-necked snake. \nDescription.\nRing-necked snakes are usually dark-colored, with a bright stripe around their necks. Ring-necked snakes that live in different areas may look different. Their heads are usually darker-colored than the rest of their bodies. \nSnakes living in different areas are often different sizes. Adults are usually long. Young snakes less than a year old are usually about and grow about a year.\nRing-necked snakes have smooth scales with 15\u201317 rows of scales in middle of their bodies. \nHabitat.\nRing-necked snakes live in many kinds of habitats. The Northern and western subspecies live in open woodlands near rocky hills, or in wetter environments with many places to hide. Southern subspecies mostly live in riparian and wet environments, especially in more arid, or dry, habitats. The snakes like it when their habitat is a little wet. Ring-necked snakes do not live higher than above sea level. In northern areas, ring-necked snakes may live in dens. Usually, more than one snake will live in one den. Ring-necked snakes often hide under pieces of wood. When it is hot, ring-necked snakes may make holes and burrows to hide in. They may also hide under rocks or other objects. Ring-necked snakes usually live in flatland forests.\nDiet.\nRing-necked snakes mostly eat salamanders, earthworms, and slugs. They sometimes eat lizards, frogs, and some young snakes of other species. Ring-necked snakes in different habitats may eat different amounts of some species. Ring-necked snakes kill their prey with constriction, which is squeezing prey to kill it, and envenomation, which is using their venom. Ring-necked snakes usually don't try to hurt bigger animals. Instead of biting bigger animals, the snake curls up its tail, showing its brightly colored stomach.\nPredators.\nCoral snakes, kingsnakes, and racers are predators of ring-necked snakes. Sometimes, large spiders or centipedes will eat young ring-necked snakes.\nSubspecies.\nThere are 14 subspecies of ring-necked snake."}

It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too.\nHistory.\nIn the past, Magadan was home to native Evens who didn't live in one place for long. They frequently traveled because they reared reindeer, hunted and fished. In the 17th century, the Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the area. They came to explore the Far East. They were looking for furs and gold. They also named the area Kolyma. Kolyma still remains as a popular name for the region. Gold and platinum were discovered in the area in the early 19th century. During Stalin's rule in the 1930s, the Soviet Union was rapidly developing because of industrialization. Therefore, there was an increase in demand for gold to pay for this industrialization. This led to many mines opening in the region. Many gulags were also opened to house the increasing forced labour population. The labourers were brought in to help dig out the minerals or make roads into the area. Magadan was famous as a result for the most number of gulag camps in the far eastern region. Prisoners-of-war during World War II were also brought to the area. After the death of Stalin in 1953, the gulags were slowly closed down and most prisoners were released. Mining activity continued with paid workers taking over the job. Living standards fell while the Soviet Union attempted to improve the economy during perestroika. This caused a lot of people to leave Magadan to find for a better life. Magadan Oblast continues to remain as a federal subject within Russia.\nGeography.\nMagadan is found in the far eastern part of Siberia. Because of this, it has a subarctic climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The landscape is mostly mountainous except in areas closer to the Sea of Okhotsk. There are plenty of animals, birds and plants in the area. The area is also very rich in minerals, like gold, silver, tin, and tungsten.\nDemographics.\nMagadan's population has been decreasing since the end of the Soviet Union according to data. Most of the population live in cities and towns, like the capital, the city of Magadan. The population consists mostly of Russians. Ethnic Evens and other natives compose of only a small part of the population. Most people in Magadan practice Orthodox Christianity or are spiritual but not religious. Some ethnic Evens still practice Shamanism or certain aspects of it, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature. Russian is taught and used commonly in Magadan. But the local Even language is still taught in some pre-school and elementary school. It is used mostly at home.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Magadan is mostly reliant on the mining of minerals, like gold, silver and tin. Hence in 2005, President Vladimir Putin has supported reducing tax for businesses involved in mineral mining. Another major industry in the area is fishing. There are limited rearing of animals or growing of crops because of the climate. This results in having to bring in food products to supply the people living in Magadan. Many people in the area do not have jobs. This is because a lot of companies have closed down due to the harsh climate and the poor condition of buildings and equipment. The government has allowed for the Special Economic Zone in Magadan to be created and extended till December 31, 2025. This was done to attract investors and business to come to Magadan.\nPolitics.\nThe Governor of Magadan is the leader of the oblast. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Magadan Oblast Duma, is the oblast's parliament. The Duma lawmakers are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Duma are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia.\nTransportation.\nMagadan is currently only connected with the rest of Russia by a road called the Kolyma Highway. There are no railway operating in the area. But there have been plans for the near future to have a railway line running towards Chukotka while cutting through Magadan. Long-distance travel can also be done by air or sea. The oblast has several airports, such as the Sokol Airport. Flights from these airports link Magadan to cities further away. However there are no international flights into the area."}

The fires can be in buildings, vehicles, woodlands, and other places. A firefighter puts out fires to protect property, people and the environment.\nFirefighters usually go through a lot of technical training. This includes fighting fires in buildings, cars and the woods.\nOne of the major hazards with firefighting is the poisonous environment made by things burning. Four major risks are smoke, oxygen deficiency, high temperatures and poisons in the air. To protect themselves from smoke, firefighters will wear a device called a breathing apparatus.\nOne way to put out fires is to spray them with water. The water does two things: it vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire. The water vapor leaves the fire with less oxygen, which it needs to keep burning. The other thing water does is make things cooler. That can keep the fire from burning because things will not burn if they are not hot enough."}

The word Luddite can be an offensive term to describe someone who is afraid of technology.\nThe movement is named after the English Luddites, who were active between 1811 and 1816. The Luddites were textile workers. They were against the new textile machinery. They believed that the machines would replace the workers over time. In response, the Luddites destroyed many of the textile machines.\nNeo-Luddites are concerned about the effect technology has on the environment, people, and/or communities.\nThe neo-Luddite movement has connections with the anti-globalisation movement, anarcho-primitivism, and radical environmentalism."}

The group was protesting against the use of machinery in a \"fraudulent and deceitful manner\" to get around standard labour practices. They were English textile workers who took an oath to resist machinery in the textile industry. \nLuddites feared that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry. They were largely correct but, on the other hand, the textile industry grew to be a major exporter of cloth. \nIt is not quite right that Luddites protested against the machinery itself in an attempt to halt progress. However, over time, the term has come to mean one opposed to industrialisation, automation, or new technologies in general. \nThe Luddite movement began in Nottingham and ended in a region-wide rebellion that lasted from 1811 to 1816. Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters. Eventually the movement was suppressed with military force."}
{"id": "669166", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=669166", "title": "Sakha Republic", "text": "The Republic of Sakha also known as Yakutia is one of 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is in the Siberia area of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Sakha is the largest federal subject of Russia. It stretches across three time zones between UTC+9 and UTC+11. The name Yakutia is also used to refer to the same area. The Yakut people speak a Turkic language.\nHistory.\nIn the past, Yakutia was home to small groups of native tribesmen that hunt to survive. In the 13th to 14 century, the Yakuts started moving north from Lake Baikal to the area. Most of the Yakuts merged or took over the lands of these native tribesmen. \nThe Yakuts were different from the other tribesmen because they reared cattle, horses and practiced blacksmith skills. These skills allowed them to stay longer in one place. During the 17th century, the Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the region. The Yakut tribes united under the famous King Tygyn Darkhan to fight the Russians. But the Yakuts lost because they did not have guns. The Russians then brought the Yakuts under their control and continued to move eastwards. Years later, many people were punished by sending them to live in Yakutia in exile. This was because Yakutia was far from most places. Between 1921 and 1923, during the Russian Civil War, the area was the last land remaining under the control of the White Russians. The area was eventually brought under the control of the Bolsheviks's Red Army. This event was known as the Yakut Revolt. \nUnder Stalin's rule, several gulags were opened in the area. These gulags were used to house the growing forced labour population. These labourers were brought in to mine the gold minerals to pay for the Soviet Union's industrialization. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Yakutia was given the name Republic of Sakha and continues to be a republic in Russia.\nGeography.\nSakha is in the north part of Eastern Siberia. Because Sakha is very big, it experiences both polar tundra and subarctic climate. Both climates have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The tundra climate makes the northern part of Sakha empty and mostly frozen. The subarctic climate allows the southern part of Sakha to have taiga type of forests. \nThese forests have many animals and birds. There are several mountain ranges around Sakha as well. The Lena Pillars are rock structures found in Sakha. The Lena Pillars are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region is also rich in minerals like diamond, gold, and coal. The area is also famous for its extreme temperatures. For example during winter the temperature can go to as low as and during summer as high as .\nDemographics.\nSakha's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time according to data. It is currently increasing again. More than half of the population live in cities and towns. Most that do so live in the capital, Yakutsk. Ethnic Yakuts who are Turkic people compose of about half of the population. Russians mostly make up the other half of the population. Most people in Sakha practice Orthodox Christianity or are atheists. Certain aspects of Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, is still practiced by ethnic Yakuts. In recent times, more natives have shown increasing interest in practicing Shamanism. Russian is taught and used commonly in Sakha. But the Yakut language is still commonly used between different native tribes, that are not Yakuts, to talk to one another. Yakut is also taught in some schools and is also used at home.\nCulture.\nThe Olonkho is a famous Yakut tale about great people and animals. It talks about legends and present day issues like the breaking apart of Yakut families. It is only performed by experts who have learn the tale thoroughly. This is because the tale is very long. The tale is part of the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This means that the tale is widely accepted to be important and needs to prevented from being forgotten.\nThe Republic Day is celebrated on April 27 every year. It celebrates the formation of Yakut ASSR during the Soviet Union in 1922. The Yhy\u0430kh festival is celebrated between 10 and 25 June every year. It is one of two New Year's Day celebrated by the Yakut people. The other being the more recognized New Year's Day in January. It is celebrated to mark the start of the short summer.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Sakha mostly relies on the mining of minerals like diamonds, gold, tin and coal. It is the region's largest producer of minerals and raw materials. Sakha also produces 99% of Russia's diamonds. This accounts for about 25% of the world's diamond output. The making of construction materials, jewellery and medicine are also major industries in Sakha. In contrast, the native Yakut people rear cattle and horses or hunt and fish to provide for themselves as well.\nPolitics.\nThe Head of Sakha is the leader of the republic. The Head is chosen by public vote every five years. The Il Tumen (Legislative Assembly), is the republic's parliament. The Il Tumen are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Il Tumen are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia.\nTransportation.\nSakha lies north of the important Trans-Siberian railway and Trans-Siberian Highway. Thus there is some distance between the republic and the main travelling routes across the country. The main road link in Sakha is the Lena Highway towards the south or the Kolyma Highway towards the east. The roads can generally be passed all year round, except across the Lena River where there is no bridge. Therefore, cars have to take a ferry across the river during summer or drive on the ice in winter. The Amur-Yakutsk train line connects Sakha with the rest of the Trans-Siberian railway. The republic has several airports, including the Yakutsk International Airport. Flights from these airports link Sakha to cities further away. The usage of the Northern Sea Route to transport goods is also possible at certain times of the year."}

More than one person plays Catan at a time. The Settlers of Catan was designed by Klaus Teuber and first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. People play as settlers, each try to build holdings while trading and getting resources. Players get points as their settlements grow. The first player to reach a set number of points, usually 10, wins. The game and its many expansions are also published by Mayfair Games, Filosofia, Capcom, 999 Games, \u039a\u03ac\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, and Devir.\n\"The Settlers of Catan\" became one of the first German-style board games to become popular outside Europe. , more than 22 million copies in 30 languages had been sold.\nThe game involves a lot of strategy, while still being fairly easy to learn.\nGameplay.\nThe players in the game represent settlers creating colonies on the island of Catan. Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island. The game board, which represents the island, is made out of tiles with six sides. (hexes) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game. Newer editions of the game began to have a fixed layout in their manual, which has been proven by computer simulations to be fair. They recommend this to be used by beginners. In 2016, editions of the game were released with a conventional fixed layout board in this configuration. The hexes of these editions cannot be rearranged.\nTeuber's original design was for a large game of exploration and development in a new land. Between 1993 and 1995 Teuber and Kosmos refined and simplified the game into its current form. Unused mechanics from that design went on to be used in Teuber's following games, \"Entdecker\" and \"L\u00f6wenherz.\" The game's first expansion, \",\" adds the concept of exploration, and the combined game (sometimes known as \"New Shores\") is probably the closest game to Teuber's original intentions."}

There have been 435 voting seats since 1913, except for a temporary increase to 437 after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii. The total number of state members is capped by the \"Reapportionment Act of 1929\". Also, each of the five inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D.C. sends a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.\nThe Bureau of the Census counts the number of people in the United States every ten years. This is called the decennial census. The numbers from the Census are used to figure out how many representavies each state gets. This is called \"apportionment\". The 2012 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2010 United States Census.\nEach state is in charge of the redistricting of districts within their state, and several states have one \"at-large\" division. Redistricting must take place if the number of members changes after a reapportionment, or may take place at any other time if demographics represented in a district has changed substantially. Districts may sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers.\nThe following is a complete list of the 435 current congressional districts for the House of Representatives, and over 200 obsolete (no longer being used) districts, and the six current and one obsolete non-voting delegations.\nAmerican Samoa.\n\"See Non-voting delegations, below.\"\nDelaware.\nThe oldest district in the country, it has never changed its shape or size.

In an open field known as \u201cthe Delta,\u201d where currently stands Memorial Hall, sophomores and freshmen would meet annually on the first Monday of the school year and engage in a free-for-all wrestling match. Sometime in the 1800\u2019s, a ball was added and would be placed between the two groups and each would try to move across the opposing side\u2019s goal line. This game was a precursor to the intercollegiate football that would soon after take hold of the Ivy League. In 1925, with the game well established in the college community, the Harvard Crimson paper still referred to this annual tradition as a \u201cfootball match.\u201d&lt;br&gt;\nMuch like the first football games played at universities such as Rutgers, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, there were not many rules, if any at all. The event always devolved into a massive fight between the competing students, with injuries, torn clothing, and even arrests being the norm. In 1903, a reporter from the New York Times noted that \u201cblack eyes and bruises were seen everywhere, and everyone received a liberal smudge of mother earth.\u201d In what is considered the first recorded account of a Harvard football game, James C. Richmond, in 1827 wrote a poem entitled \u201cThe Battle of the Delta.\u201d\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Freshmen\u2019s wrath, to Sophs the direful spring\nOf shins unnumbered bruised, great goddess sing;\nLet fire and music in my song be mated,\nPure fire and music unsophisticated.\nThrough warlike crowds a devious way it wins,\nAnd advancing shins meet advancing shins;\nAcross the rampart many a hero bounds;\nBut sing Apollo! In can sing no more,\nFor Mars advancing threw the dust before.&lt;br&gt;\n The game that would eventually evolve from this spectacle would be no less dangerous. The early days of college football saw gruesome injuries and even deaths. However, the difference is the early Harvard tradition was less about the game, and more about the clash between students. A Harvard Police official, General Charles R Apted, described the games as the \u201cupperclassmen [gathering] all the Freshman in the Yard and administer[ing] justice.\u201d The faculty viewed the tradition as a hazing rather than a game and eventually voted to ban it from campus in 1860. As a show of protest, the students held a mock funeral for an entity they dubbed \u201cFootball Fight, um.\u201d A report in the Harvard Crimson described it: \u201cSophomores appropriately garbed, held imposing funeral procession and services. A coffin was provided\u2026 and a grave was dug.\u201d&lt;br&gt;\n 11 years later, in 1871, the game was brought back to Harvard University, although in a more organized form. Interest in football-like games had picked up among other Ivy League schools, including Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton and Yale. The other schools wished to establish an intercollegiate set of rules that would have more closely resembled modern soccer, but Harvard resisted, wishing to preserve the ability to pick the ball up and tackle opposing players. Harvard eventually found a school with a common style with which it could play against in McGill University of Montreal, Quebec. In 1874, the two teams met in what many consider to be one of the first games \u201crecognized as the legitimate predecessor of modern football.\u201d"}

She is well known for her repeating dot patterns, her art uses a variety of media, including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, performance and immersive installation. It ranges from works on paper featuring intense semi-abstract imagery, to soft sculpture known as \u2018Accumulations\u2019, to her \u2018Infinity Net\u2019 paintings, made up of carefully repeated arcs of paint built up into large patterns.\nSince 1977 Kusama has lived voluntarily in a psychiatric institution, and much of her work has been marked with obsessiveness and a desire to escape from psychological trauma. In an attempt to share her experiences, she creates installations that immerse the viewer in her obsessive vision of endless dots and nets or infinitely mirrored space.\nBiography.\nYayoi Kusama was born in 1929 in Matsumoto city in Nagano. She started drawing pictures with a motif of polka dots with water colorat, pastel and oil at 10 years old. She entered art university in Kyoto afterwards went to the United States of America to study art even though her parents didn't agree with her. She did intense performances whose name were \u201chappening\u201d there to protest wars and her name was known from top to bottom in the US as a great performer. In 1968 her own movie won the prize of The 4th Belgian International Short Film Festival. Moreover, her exhibitions were held around the world. In 2009, she was selected as a person of culture merits which give people who are active in terms of culture. Finally The documentary movie on her was released in 2019. It received high evaluations.\nSickness.\nShe actually has suffered from Hallucination; her field of vision is covered with polka dots and flowers speak to her, since an early age. She has got schizophrenia, nerve sick, from childhood to now. Therefore, she decided to paint to run away from the hallucination and fearness of death. Her works reflect what she really sees through her eyes.\nArt works.\nHer every works are expensive. The highest one is no less than 63 million. One reason, of course, is popularity and originality. Furthermore, another reason is her attitude to works. She only releases her works into auctions when she has trouble with money. She also said, \u201cI don\u2019t create my works just because they can make a lot of money.\u201d That's why her works are really expensive.\nLooking at the features of her works, many polka dots are seen in her works. Identical pattern cover on painting and sculpture is her own way. We can say polka dots are her trademark. Her works don't stop on campus. She also uses mirrors in her works to make objects seen as though they were infinity.\n\u2014Belief\nthroughout her entire life, her belief is \u201cI\u2019m fighting for the production of arts.\u201d Her works has been put into her heart and soul. She also said \u201cThere are many people who are suffering from war, poverty and loneliness. I couldn\u2019t be happier that my passion tells them through my works after I pass away.\u201d"}

It uses evidence of the real world and careful thinking to develop beliefs. It rejects beliefs where there is no good evidence for them. Sentientism says we should care about all sentient beings and care more about beings that are more sentient.\nSentient beings include anything that can experience good or bad things or feelings. These include humans, most non-human animals and may eventually include artificial beings we create or intelligent aliens we meet.\nPeople who agree with sentientism are called sentientists. They are atheist and often humanist. They are also often vegan or vegetarian for moral reasons.\nThings that are not sentient, such as plants, rivers and mountains, may be important because they affect how sentient beings feel. However, we don't need to care about them directly because they cannot suffer or feel pleasure.\nSentientist thinking has a long history, from Jeremy Bentham's An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation through to modern philosophers such as Richard D. Ryder and Peter Singer.\nSentientism differs from Speciesism because it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species, to decide what things we should care about.\nSentientism differs from painism because it counts positive experience, as well as the ability to feel pain, in making moral decisions.\nSentientism agrees with Animalism that humans are animals so we should care about both. However, sentientism argues that we should also care about non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences.\nNotable Sentientists.\nNotable sentientists include: Thandie Newton, Bill Maher, James Cameron, Stephen Fry, George Meyer, Ricky Gervais, Sam Harris, Benjamin Spock, Oliver Sykes, Steven Pinker, Gary Holt (musician), Ellen Page, Kristen Bell, Cloris Leachman, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Richard Dawkins, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Jessica Lange and John Stewart Bell.\nIn some cases sentientism is implied because these people are atheists and/or humanists and vegans or vegetarians."}

Most hunt\u00ading is done along rivers, but these weasels sometimes go into grasslands or sub\u00adur\u00adban areas.\nIn win\u00adter, these slim weasels spend most of their time under the snow chas\u00ading small ro\u00addents through a maze of tunnels. After catch\u00ading and eat\u00ading the prey, Japan\u00adese weasels usually enjoy the warmth of the prey's nest after eat\u00ading.\nFeeding.\nThey eat mice, frogs, reptiles, insects and crayfish. They sometimes eat berries, seeds and fruits but only when hungry. Males like to eat more mammals and crustacean. Females like to eat insects, fruits and earthworms.\nTheir diet changes depending on the season, the number of some foods. Fish and insects are a part of their diet throughout all seasons. They mostly eat coleoptera insects in spring, fruits in summer, orthoptera insects and crustaceans in autumn and fish and fruit in winter. Japanese weasels help in controlling rodent and other small animal populations.\nBehavior.\nJapanese weasels live by themselves, with the except when mating, and raising the young ones. They do not like other Japanese weasels entering their home range and will defend their home range. When scared, weasels release musk to discourage predators.\nJapanese weasels are also great hunters. They chase down prey by any means, including running down tunnels, climbing trees, or swimming. Anywhere prey can go, the weasel can follow. They are both diurnal and nocturnal.\nReproduction.\nThe mating season is from early May to late June. After mating, gestation takes about 30 days. The number of kits varies from 2 to 12, but is usually 5 or 6. It takes 8 weeks to fully be weaned and live by themselves. Japanese weasels are sexually mature at one year old.\nBreeding season is twice a year in Kyushu, once a year in Hokkaido.\nEconomic importance.\nIn the past century Japanese weasels have been introduced to many small Japanese islands to kill rats that were damaging crops. Together with the use of some rodenticide, the weasels helped reduce rat populations. Japanese weasels are also trapped and used in the fur trade. Japanese weasels also sometimes hunt domestic birds, such as chickens and ducks.\nConservation status.\nAlthough their populations are in slight decline, Japanese weasels are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of their widespread population across Japan. The main threat to Japanese weasels is habitat loss because of residential and commercial development."}

An algorithm is simply a series of steps to solve a problem. The general idea of divide and conquer is to take a problem and break it apart into smaller problems that are easier to solve. \nThis idea can be seen in many popular algorithms. A helpful way to think of this idea, would be when a person looks through a dictionary. For example, if they are looking for the word \u201cDog\u201d, and land on a page with the word \u201cFiretruck\u201d, the person knows that all the pages to the right of firetruck will not contain dog. They know this because D comes before F in the alphabet. This logic allows a person to spend less time searching, because every time they arrive on a page with the wrong letter, they know that they can eliminate the pages to their right or their left. This is an example of diving a problem up into smaller pieces. If one were to apply this concept in programming, one might start with an ordered list. If they wanted to search through that list, they would start near the center of that list. Simple logic would determine if the desired element is to the right or the left of the middle element, or in some cases it may even be the middle element. From there, each time this algorithm searches, it decreases the size of the list by half. This makes searching through the list extremely efficient."}

Simply, it can be thought of as a repeating if statement. \u00a0\nOverview.\nThe while loop consists of two parts: the condition and a block of code. The condition is evaluated and if it is true, the block of code is executed. This repeats until the condition evaluates to false. As a pre-test loop, the while loop checks the condition before the block is executed. In contrast, the do-while loop checks the condition \"after\" the loop has executed. A while loop would typically be used when you don't know the number of times you would like to loop over the block of code. Instead, code would continue looping until a particular condition is met. When the number of times a loop is to be executed is already known before the execution of the loop, a for loop would be a better choice. \nA template of a while loop is shown below:\nwhile (condition) \n statements;\nExample.\nExample code in the C programming language is shown below.\nint x = 0;\nwhile (x &lt; 5) \n printf (\"x = %d\\n\", x);\n x++;\nIn this example, the loop first checks to see if the variable x is less than 5. Because it is, it will enter the loop, printing the value of x and then increment x by 1. After completing the code block, it will continue to repeat the code block until x is equal to 5. When x is equal to five, the condition evaluates to false and the code exits the while loop.\nA loop that continues repeating forever is possible if the condition is always true. When this happens, it is up to the developer to create a statement to exit the loop. An example of this is shown below: \u00a0\nwhile (true) \n //do complicated stuff\n if (someCondition) break;\n //more stuff\nIn the above example, the condition while always be true. To exit the loop, a break statement is used when a specific condition inside the loop evaluates to true."}

In different languages, there are different keywords to specify this statement\u2014ways to identify a for loop\u2014but they all do the same task. Most languages use either \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cdo\u201d as keywords.\nA for-loop has two parts: a header, and a body of code. The body consists of a set of instructions (lines of code) that run for each repetition of the loop. The header often declares how many loops to compete, generally indicated by either a loop counter or a loop variable. For-loops are typically used when the number of repetitions are known. For-loops are similar to \u201cwhile-loops\u201d, but usually have a known number of repetitions.\nSample for-loop in Python:\nfor i in range(10):\nprint('Hello, world!')\nThis for loop prints outs \"Hello, world!\" ten times.\nThe name for-loop comes from the English word for, which is the direct translation of the earlier German \"f\u00fcr\", used by Heinz Rutishauser, who also helped define ALGOL 58 and 60.\nLoop Counter.\nIn computer science, a loop counter is a variable that controls how many repetitions the loop will do. Usually, the loop counter variable is an integer value that increments by 1 for each completed loop. However, loop counters can also decrement, and can have step sizes other than 1. \nLoop counters change each iteration. With each repeat, there is unique counter value. The loop counter is the deciding factor for when a loop should end and go onto the next section of code.\nCommon identifier names for loop counters are i, j, and k(and so on, if needed).\nfor loop.\nA for-loop is available in most common programming languages. While for-loops in different languages will all fulfill the same task, there are differences on how each programming language deals with for loops."}

The general specs one will see for it will be 60 Hz, or 120 Hz. It is measured in Hz which is a measurement of frequency. In this case, 60 Hz will denote that the frequency at which pictures are shown for that screen is 60 images per second. It is a common property of monitors or televisions and it will dictate the maximum frames per second (fps) that the system is able to put out. For example, having a game running at 128 fps will show no improvements if the screen it's being played on has a refresh rate of 60 Hz. In that case, the screen can't keep up with how fast the game wants to show images, so it will default at 60 fps as it's fastest speed.\nAs the refresh rate of a screen is increased, the amount of images shown is doubled and there are more noticeable changes in terms of picture quality. Depending on what's being displayed on the screen, the jump from 60 Hz to 120 Hz is the line between whether or not you're going to be able to see motion blur when pictures are moving too fast for the screen to handle. But commonly, most streaming services and television shows will run at a maximum of 60 Hz, so unless one plans to do extensive gaming and wants optimal visuals, having a screen with a 60 Hz refresh rate will do the trick for most cases."}

By setting these poses, an animator can artistically direct how the geometry will be framed in some key events. These poses are in the same sense as how a person may pose for photography session. Note that every shapes and objects in computer graphics are considered as \"geometry\". With key events specified, the animation software will then automatically fill the intermediary motions between key points, thereby creating continuous motion throughout the timeline without requiring additional works by an animator.\n\"Procedural animation\" is a rule-base approach to creating animations. These rules are typically some form of mathematical or statistical functions which tell the animation software how an object is to be animated. In order for the geometry to be animated, these functions typically require some form of time-based variable as its input. Therefore, one can apply a chain of logical rules and algorithms to create animations without manually specify any key poses.\nProcedural modeling.\nIn computer graphics, \"modeling\" refers to an act of digitally sculpting a model. As one creates rule-based animation, \"procedural modeling\" then refers to same rule-based, algorithmic approach to creating geometry. Procedural modeling differs from procedural animation in that time-based variable is not required.\nProceduralism.\nAmongst some group of animators within computer graphics industry, procedural modeling and animation method is also known as \"proceduralism\".\nAdvantages and disadvantages of proceduralism.\nIn order to maximize artistic impact of their craft, animators employ traditional animation techniques to set pose manually at a specific point in time. When the objects to be animated become significantly more complex, traditional animation techniques may not be feasible. Therefore, \"proceduralism\" offers significant advantage as complexities increase significantly. While \"proceduralism\" enables its practitioners to create infinite variation of models and animations, specific key pose is often left as random chance. Therefore, computer graphics animator must decide between the combinations of both techniques in order to achieve the desired outcome.\nApplications of procedural animation.\n\"Procedural animation\" is used extensively in visual effects for movie and gaming industry where animation data and geometry must be generated with certain random probability in order to simulate physical world."}

It uses small mirrors that reflect light. The mirrors can be moved to either reflect light or not reflect light. The mirrors move very fast. When the mirror reflects light more often, it makes a lighter color. When the mirror reflects light less often, it makes a darker color. DLP projectors can be bright and have a high resolution. This can make the picture look better. DLP projectors can be small so they can be moved more easily. Some DLP projectors are small enough to fit in a smartphone. Big DLP projectors are often used in movie theaters.\nDigital Micromirror Devices.\nDLP projectors use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to make the picture. A DMD is made of many very small mirrors. The mirrors are in a grid on a semiconductor. Each mirror makes a small part of the picture, called a pixel. The resolution increases when the DMD has more mirrors.\nThe mirrors can be moved so they reflect light through the lens or reflect light somewhere else. When mirror reflects light through the lens, the pixel is light. When the mirror reflects light somewhere else, the pixel is dark. The mirrors move much faster than a person can see. When the mirror spends more time reflecting light through the lens, the pixel is lighter. When the mirror spends more time reflecting light somewhere else, the pixel is darker."}

A good format can help the user perform right interactions and a good graphic design can help the user focus on the function in the system. During the design process, we must balance the functions and visual effects to create a stable, adaptable, and functional system for users.\nInterface design is applied in many different areas such as computers, to cars, to planes. Even though most of these areas have similar human interactions, we still need special skills to accomplish the design goals. That is why designers are usually specialized in some areas than others in order to make the best efforts out of themselves."}

This algorithm is commonly used for a computer to play two player games, such as chess, go, and checkers. The algorithm stops analyzing a move when it finds another possible move that is proven to be better, and that move will not be analyzed again. This algorithm is a modification of .\nAlgorithm.\nThe algorithm keeps track of two values, Alpha and Beta, and assigns \"points\" to possible moves where the greater the amount of points a move has, the higher chance that choosing that move will lead to victory. Alpha represents the minimum amount of points the player the algorithm wants to win can have(the maximizing player), while beta is the maximum amount of points the algorithm wants to lose can have(the minimizing player). Alpha and Beta start as negative infinity and infinity respectively. Whenever a move is found such that the maximizing player's score improves or the minimizing player's score decreases, then Alpha and Beta will be replaced with those new values.\nIn the best case, the complexity of the algorithm is O(formula_1) while the worst case is O(formula_2) where b is the branching factor, that is how much each move splits into future options on average, and d is the depth, as in on average how many possible moves are made into the game."}

It is eventually to replace 4G,\nThere are three main groups of frequencies used by 5G:\nLowband 5G is a type of 5G that uses low frequencies, just as 4G does. Lowband 5G has long range (meaning you can be far away from a tower or inside a building and still get signal) but slower speeds than other types of 5G. Lowband 5G is only a little bit faster than LTE. Lowband 5G usually has speeds of around 100 Mbit/s.\nMidband 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies slightly higher than lowband 5G. It has shorter range than lowband 5G, but you can usually still get service indoors using midband 5G. Midband 5G is much faster than LTE. Midband 5G usually has speeds of 600 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.\nmmWave 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies much higher than lowband and midband. It has very short range. With mmWave, you can't get service inside buildings. Most solid objects can block mmWave. mmWave is much faster than any other type of 5G and can reach speeds of up to 2 Gbit/s currently. mmWave is considered the least practical version of 5G since the range is so short and basically anything can block it.\n4G phones do not work on 5G. To use 5G, you need a phone that supports it. Most 5G phones have \"5G\" at the end of the phone's name.\nThere are concerns from conspiracy theorists that 5G might cause cancer or COVID-19. Scientists have found these theories to not be true."}

He was known as a determined loyalist of Joseph Stalin, and in 1935 he wrote a paper in which he argued that political opposition must eventually lead to violence and terrorism; this became in part the ideological basis of the Purges. He became head of the NKVD in early 1937, after the dismissal of Genrikh Yagoda. Under Yezhov, the purges reached their height, with roughly half of the Soviet political and military establishment being exiled or shot, along with hundreds of thousands of others, suspected of disloyalty or wrecking.\nEventually, Stalin dismissed Yezhov from his post in November 1938, demoting him to the post of Commissar of Water Transport; less than a year later, Yezhov was arrested and put on trial for excesses committed during the Purges. In his defence, Yezhov said that he regretted only that he had not punished enough counter-revolutionaries. He was found guilty and probably executed in secret in 1940."}

Its focus is community relations with the police and aid for Puerto Rico.\nHistory.\nEl Grito de Sunset Park started in 2001 that had gathered after the Puerto Rican Parade in Manhattan, New York as an organized \"cop watch\" program. It took action to document the chaotic relations between police and community members. El Grito de Sunset Park officially became an organization in 2005 after acquiring a large backing by the community for its need of it. The founders are Dennis Flores, Jason del Aguila, and Noelle Flores Th\u00e9ard.\nMembers.\nEl Grito de Sunset Park is a small organization that consists of five members including the three founders. They are helped by volunteers that come in for special projects and for the Puerto Rican Parade every year. Members and volunteers use their phones and cameras to record police brutality and document the incidents that occur in Sunset Park to raise awareness of the oppression the community is receiving. The recording are shared on platforms and their websites to support and serve as evidence of how police officers act on duty. \nObjective.\nEl Grito de Sunset Park is an organization that fights against oppression from the socially and economically disenfranchised system. The organization is completely volunteer run and is a non-profit organization. The group coordinates campaigns, public forums, emergency relief, speak outs, and educational programs for the community. El Grito is also in collaboration with groups with the objective to end \u201czero tolerance policing\u201d in New York City. \nPolice Relations.\nEl Grito de Sunset Park collaborated with WITNESS to build a database where they can focus on the 72nd precinct in Brooklyn in the Sunset Park community. With the database in its infancy the project initially launched a website where videos and any facts on officers was gathered and publicly displayed. The database that was built was a tool open for the public to show the police abuse occurring in Sunset Park. Profiles were made on incidents attached to the responding officers involved and is kept up to date to this very day. The information accessible to the public was also created to help create a broader picture for the overall sentiment of the officers mainly involved in the 72nd Precinct. Another scope inside this database is that a correlation of abuse and those officers\u2019 salaries correlations were created. On such correlations the organization El Grito Sunset Park wanted to show in certain instances abusive officers were in fact getting steady inclines to their salaries and is a provocative talking point in their fightback against such tyranny. \nSupport For Puerto Rico.\nEl Grito de Sunset Park is involved in towns throughout the island. They work in are Aguadilla, Yabucoa, Vieques, and San Juan.They reached out to help Puerto Rico when they were hit by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. The organization sent aid at the time of Hurricane Irma and then flew out to Puerto Rico a week after Hurricane Maria hit to provide support and assistance to the communities of Puerto Rico. El Grito de Sunset Park is involved in C\"aserios P\u00fablicos\" (Spanish: Public Housing)\".\" They work directly with Luis Llor\u00e9ns Torres which is the largest public housing project in San Juan. El Grito de Sunset Park members and the community organizers of Luis Llor\u00e9ns Torres worked together to provide aid and relief in mountain top communities where no aid was distributed at the time of the hurricanes. \nCurrent and Future work.\nEl Grito de Sunset Park received a donation of thirteen acres of land in a mountaintop community located in Yabucoa. They are working directly with farmers of the community to grow vegetables and fruits. They are trying to build a self sustaining model to fund the work they are doing on the island and to grow coffee. Members of El Grito de Sunset Park hope to create a space to bring young people of the diaspora back to the island to learn about the Puerto Rican culture and agriculture. "}

It is northeast of Baghdad.\nPoison gas attack.\nThe city is known for an incident in the final phase of the Iran-Iraq War. The Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas, supported by Iran, took control of the city. On March 16, 1988, after two days of ordinary artillery attacks, Iraqi Air Force planes dropped gas canisters on the town. The town and surrounding district were attacked with bombs, artillery fire and chemical weapons, the last of which proved most damaging. At least 5,000 people died as an immediate result of the chemical attack. It is estimated that a further 7,000 people were injured or suffered long-term illness. Most of the victims of the attack on the town of Halabja were Kurdish civilians.\nThe attack is believed to have included the nerve agents Tabun, Sarin and VX, as well as mustard gas. Another possibility, according to the former senior CIA analyst Stephen C. Pelletiere, is that Iraq did not have the nerve agent to use in the attack but did have mustard gas which had been used in the Iran\u2013Iraq War. It is occasionally suggested that cyanide was also included among these chemical weapons, though this assertion has been cast into doubt, as cyanide is a natural byproduct of impure Tabun. The attack on Halabja took place amidst the Anfal campaign, in which Saddam Hussein powerfully suppressed Kurdish revolts during the Iran\u2013Iraq War.\nBefore the war ended, Iraqi forces moved in on the ground and completely destroyed the town. In March 2010, the Iraqi High Criminal Court recognized the Halabja massacre as genocide. This decision was welcomed by the Kurdistan Regional Government."}

The names Michelsberg culture (1908) and the Altheim culture (1915) as well as the periodization of the Hallstatt culture go back to him. Particularly important are his contributions in Volume V of the \"Antiquities of our pagan past\" (Alterth\u00fcmer unserer heidnischen Vorzeit), where he developed, a chronology system, based on an historical analysis of stylistic features and on typological characteristics, that has essentially retained its validity to this day.

Because of his coach's suggestion, Lee moved the Thomas Flairs into his pommel horse routine when he studied in the middle school.2\nWhen Lee Chih-Kai was 15, he left his hometown Yilan county and moved to Taoyuan city, where Lin Yu-Shin coached a university gymnastic team. Lee practiced with the team in the early morning before going to school and returned to the gym after school. During high school, he practiced at least 8 hours per day. His coach said that Lee was not the most talented gymnast, but was the most hard-working one.3\nIn 2013, Lee Chih-Kai joined the adult national team training program.

He was the first gymnast to qualify the Olympics since the 2000 Sydney Olympic games. Lee was diagnosed with a broken right shinbone and a sprained right ankle one month before the Olympic game. Lee lost the chance to move to the finals because these injuries affected his performance. After the failure in the Olympic game, Lee started training overseas. In addition, his coach helped him adapt to stressful environments by imitating the crowds and noisy environment when he was practicing.\nIn August 2017, Lee Chih-Kai won the gold medal in the pommel horse event in the Taipei by performing his signature \u201cThomas Flairs\u201d movement in the routine. Lee was the first Taiwanese male gymnast who won the gold medal in the pommel horse event.

It is in the east end of the region of Pays de la Loire, which is in the nortwestern France. The Chateau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art is in the town. Montsoreau is both listed part of the Loire Valley, a UNESCO world heritage site, and among the most beautiful villages of France.\nHistory.\nThe main witness of the first settlement is the , which probably dates from the 3rd millennium BC. Montsoreau is located on the borders of the territories of the Gallic tribes of Pictones, Turones and Andecavi. Coins, shards and fragments of Gallo-Roman tiles, were found in Montsoreau, especially on the edge of the plateau, above the town.\nMontsoreau was identified under the name \"Restis\" (rope or fish net) at the end of classical antiquity as a port on the Loire at the confluence of the Loire and the Vienne. It kept this name until the end of the eleventh century. \nThe name \"Montsoreau\" (Mount Soreau) come from a rocky promontory in the riverbed of the Loire and surrounded by water. There has been three major buildings on this promontory, a Gallo-Roman temple or administrative building, a fortified castle, and a Renaissance palace.\nThe first fortified castle was built by the count of Blois at the end of the tenth century, immediatly taken by The Count of Anjou, Fulk Nerra, took the fortress in 1001 and incorporated it to Anjou. Fulk, who was one of the first great builders of Medieval castles, modified it, and the fortress remained under the control of Anjou, never taken, during more than 150 years. \nIn 1152, Guillaume IV de Montsoreau sided with Geoffroy Plantagenet against his brother Henry II Plantagenet, future king of England and husband of Eleanor of Aquitaine. Henri II besieged the castle and took it at the end of August 1152 despite the care taken at its fortification. This was the one and only storming of the medieval fortress of Montsoreau between Fulk and Jean II de Chambes in 1450. \nAt the end of the Hundred Years War, Charles VII and Louis XI installed royal power in Chinon. They encouraged or ordered their lords to build new buildings or redevelop old fortresses. Thus began the construction of buildings in a new style in France, giving birth to Renaissance architecture, with the renowned \"Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley\". \nIn 1450, Jean II de Chambes, First councelor of Charles VII and ambassador in Venice, bought the fortress of Fulk III to his brother in law and destroyed it in order to build a residential palace on the top of the rock of Montsoreau (the mount Soreau). In an unprecedented move, he built the Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau in a residential style following Italian architecture of the time which makes it the first Renaissance building in France. The Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau was directly on the river bank and still today, it remains the only ch\u00e2teau of the Loire Valley to have been built in the river bed of the Loire.\nIn 1572, four days after Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre (24 August) in Paris, Jean de Chambes started the \"St. Bartolomew Angevine\". He almost eliminated the Reformed Church both in Saumur and Angers.\nAfter the French Revolution, the exploitation of a building stone, the Tuffeau stone, brutally passed its population of 600 inhabitants to more than 1000, maintained during the first half of the nineteenth century.\nThe battle of Saumur, is considered as the first act of resistance of World War II in France.\nIn Montsoreau, Saumur and Gennes, in June 1940, teenage students of the school of cavalry, still under training and with derisory weapons (including an artillery gun from the school museum), heroically engaged an entire German panzer division for nearly three days. And in doing so became a legend in France. \u2013 \"For Honour Alone\", Roy Macnab, January 1989.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nMontsoreau is at the center of the Loire Valley, in north-western France, from the Atlantic Ocean, and approximately from Saumur, Chinon and Bourgueil. It is in southeastern Maine-et-Loire department, about halfway between Paris and Bordeaux. The village is at the crossroad of the three main administrative regions of, Pays de la Loire, Centre-Val de Loire, and Nouvelle Aquitaine, and of the three departments of, Maine-et-Loire Indre-et-Loire, and Vienne.\nMontsoreau is part of the Metropolitan Area of Saumur Val de Loire and share borders with municipalities both in the Maine-et-Loire and Indre-et-Loire departments. These municipalities are: Candes-Saint-Martin, Chouz\u00e9-sur-Loire, Fontevraud-l'Abbaye, and Turquant. "}

It is the only ch\u00e2teau of the Loire Valley to have been built in the Loire riverbed.\nPhilippe M\u00e9aille opened the Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art in 2016. Nowadays, The chateau hold the world's largest collection of Art &amp; Language works.\nThe chateau has been built on the top of the \"mount Soreau\". This rocky promontory gave its name to the village. On the top of that mount was built a roman temple, a fortress of the counts of Anjou, and a chateau in the Renaissance architectural style.\nIn English one often speaks of the chateau de Montsoreau or Montsoreau. The chateau de Montsoreau was the first of the chateaux of the Loire Valley to be built in the Renaissance architectural style. When the chateau was built, Montsoreau was already a historical village, home of a royal fortified castle. From 1450, when King Charles VII and King Louis XII moved to Chinon and Tours, the Loire Valley became the centre of power of the ancien r\u00e9gime.\nHistory.\nThe first fortified castle was built by Odo the First count of Blois in 990. In 1001, it was taken by the count of Anjou, Fulk Nerra (\"Fulk the Black\"), one of the greatest builders of the middle age, who gave it to Gautier I of Montsoreau. Gautier I belonged to one of the most pre-eminent families of Anjou. Thus, the Castrum Monsorelli became one of the forty fortified castles in Anjou and one of the few to be given the title of lordship at the turn of year 1000. A town developed quickly near the castle. Fulk and Gautier modified the castle, and this one remained impregnable during more than 150 years. In 1152 and 1156 Henry II King of England, besieged and took twice, the castle of Montsoreau.\nIn 1450, the end of the hundred years war was coming and Jean II de Chambes, the first councellor of Charles VII King of France, bought the castle to his brother in law. Associated with Jacques Coeur, He was one of the richest man of France. He was also France ambassador in Venice and Turkey. He destroyed the fortified castle and built the chateau de Montsoreau in the new architectural style of the Renaissance.\nArchitecture.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau is said to be the first French Renaissance Building. The building marks the transition from military architecture to palace or chateau. Large windows, numerous chimneys, and the great care that taken to sanitation problems, are some of the characteristics of this new style of building. The castle central dwelling was built directly in the Loire riverbed. Unusually, Two right-angled wings looking like square towers were built a few years later, at a time when round towers were usually built, this odd choice prefigures the corner pavilions of classical architecture. A spiral staircase probably existed before the current Renaissance staircase.\nArt.\nFran\u00e7ois Rabelais.\nIn Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais' Pantagruel, Gargantua rewards Ithybole with Montsoreau, after his victory over Picrochole, the king who attacks the kingdom of Grandgousier.\nJoseph Mallord William Turner.\nIn 1832, Joseph Mallord William Turner made an aquarelle depicting the chateau of Montsoreau with the setting of the confluence of the Vienne and the Loire and the collegiate church of Candes-Saint-Martin.\nAlexandre Dumas.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau was immortalised by Alexandre Dumas in La Dame de Monsoreau, a novel written between 1845 and 1846. This novel takes as a backdrop the Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau and is part of Alexandre Dumas' trilogy on European wars of religion, between La Reine Margot and Les Quarante-cinqs.\nAuguste Rodin.\nAt the end of nineteenth century, Montsoreau was ruined. Auguste Rodin, passionate about architecture, unexpectedly made a drawing of the chateau as it was when it was built.\nCh\u00e2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art, in the Loire valley, is a private museum open to the public.

The permanent collection, gathered over the past 25 years by Philippe M\u00e9aille, is not only intended to be exhibited at the Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau, but also to be lent to other institutions.

Life forms, as microorganisms, may have lived much earlier. The earliest time that life forms first appeared on Earth is unknown. Such life forms may have lived as early as 4.28 billion years ago, not long after the oceans were formed 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.\nA life form, or lifeform, is an organism that is living. Estimates of the number of species of life forms on Earth range from 14 million, to as many as 1 trillion species. More than 99% of all species of life forms that have ever lived on Earth are thought to be extinct. Life forms may be found everywhere on Earth. This includes underground, possibly at least 12 miles deep underground, and the deepest parts of the oceans. Life can be found at least 47 miles high in the atmosphere and, under test conditions, it survives the vacuum of outer space.\nAccording to one researcher, \"You can find microbes everywhere \u2014 [they are] extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are\".\nEarliest life forms.\nFossil evidence is at the basis of most studies about the origin of life. The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years; the best evidence of early life on Earth dates from at least 3.46 billion years ago.\nIn 2017, fossils of fossilized microorganisms were reported to have been discovered near hydrothermal vents in Quebec, Canada. These fossils are thought to be at least 3.779 million years old.\nAlso in 2017, evidence of life on land may have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old rocks, discovered in Western Australia, that are usually found around hot springs and geysers.\nIn November 2017, a study by the University of Edinburgh suggested that life on Earth may have originated from biological particles carried by streams of space dust.\nNonetheless, according to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth \u2026 then it could be common in the universe.\""}

Plants created using mutagenesis are sometimes called mutagenic plants or mutagenic seeds. From 1930 to 2014 more than 3200 mutagenic plant varieties were released. 70 precent of these plants are direct mutants,thirty percent are the offspring of direct mutants. Crop plants account for three quarters of released mutagenic species with the remaining quarter are ornamentals or decorative plants. Even though the FAO/IAEA reported in 2014 that over 1,000 mutant varieties of major staple crops were being grown worldwide, it is unclear how many of these varieties are currently used in agriculture or horticulture around the world, as these seeds are not always identified or labeled as a mutagen or having a mutagenic provenance."}
