K. Rowling are usually because people say the books have occult or Satanic parts. These sayings come from some Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians. It also comes from Muslims who argue against the series.\nA great number of people have replied to these claims. People who support the series say that the magic in \"Harry Potter\" is not really like occultism. They say it is more like fairy tales like \"Cinderella\" and \"Snow White\". They also suggest that it is more like the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Both writers are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian values. Some argue that the \"Harry Potter\" novels try hard not to discuss religion at all.\nIn the United States, people tried to get the books banned in schools. Their argument was that witchcraft is a registered religion, so letting the books in schools went against the separation of church and state. This then went to court to decide whether it was against the freedom of religion.\nHowever, sometimes religion has supported the \"Harry Potter\" series. \"At least as much as they've been attacked from a theological point of view\", says Rowling, \"[the books] have been lauded (praised) and taken into pulpit, and most interesting and satisfying for me, it's been by several different faiths\"."}

Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m and Rebecka Liljeberg are \"Elin\" and \"Agnes\". \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\" won four Guldbagge Awards at the 1999 awards ceremony. The movie was not filmed in \u00c5m\u00e5l, the city that gives the name to the movie, but in Trollh\u00e4ttan, another small city in Sweden. The movie is really famous in lesbian environments around the world.\nPlot summary.\nThe movie tells the story of two girls, Agnes and Elin, who go to school in the small town of \u00c5m\u00e5l. Elin is outgoing and popular, but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes has a crush on Elin, but cannot find any way to express it. Agnes's parents worry about their daughter and try to make her happy. They throw a birthday party for her, but Agnes is afraid no one will come. Her friend, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are only friends because no one wants to make friends with either of them. Elin arrives late at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to a different party, where there will be a boy she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfils the dare, and then runs away. Elin soon discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She pretends to be in love with Johan Hult, the boy she avoided at the start. She loses her virginity to him, but later breaks up with him, telling him that she is in love with someone else, truly she understand that boys want just sex from the girls, so she try to see around herself, and she discovers the love for Agnes. Elin and Agnes eventually show each other's feelings at the end of the movie, where, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they decide to \"out\" their relationship to all students in the school."}

The search term is called a Keyword. The results of the search are displayed in search engine's results pages (SERPS) such as those given by Google. A more common word used to describe search engine optimization is internet marketing or search engine marketing.\nOn-page SEO.\nOn-page SEO, or commonly termed as \u201con-site SEO,\u201d refers to the practice of optimizing web pages and content for the users and search engines to boost ranking and generate website traffic. In other words, it refers to the elements and attributes inside of a website, such as content, HTML, system, CSS, and internal links.\nOn-page SEO is still a predominant strategy practiced by web owners and web development agencies because of its essence in ranking website through content and boost online visibility through keywords in which Google uses to index websites and rank accordingly. In fact, Google\u2019s own \u201cHow Search Works\u201d reported that, \u201cThe most basic signal that information is relevant is when a web page contains the same keyword as the search query. If those keywords appear on the page, or if they appear in the headings or body of the text, the information is more likely to be relevant.\u201d\nOff-page SEO.\nOff-page SEO refers to the elements and attributes outside of a website that increases online engagement and vital in attracting potential customers. It focuses mainly on link building strategy, social media integration, and local SEO.\nOff-page is the complete opposite of on-page SEO, but it also has the same level of relevance - one cannot work without the other. It\u2019s one of the best ways to provide a relevant result to the users and earn back links from another website to boost credibility. Since the focus of off-page SEO is the outside activities of a website, it\u2019s expected that one\u2019s ranking will increase as well as the page rank. It also utilizes the presence of social media platforms that can effectively increase engagement and exposure that is a great way to establish brand awareness and trustworthiness.\nImportance.\nSEO has become an important part of marketing campaigns run by businesses to find customers online because 65% of the people who search for something don't look beyond the 5th result of the search engine's results page. Many companies use SEO companies to do the work for them because it takes too much time to do themselves.\nSearch engine companies like Google, Yahoo, Bing are careful to watch that spam does not affect their search engine results pages by adding filters such as Google's PageRank. These filters are known as algorithms.\nMost people do not need to pay for search engine optimization services because usually a website is supposed to show up on the search engines over time anyway. But some online shopping websites may want to show up sooner, and so they pay for search engine optimization from companies that provide it.\nWhite hat and black hat techniques.\nWhen someone uses a method approved by search engines to rank their website, it is called a \"white hat technique\". If the method is not approved it is called a \"black hat technique\". Search engines may penalize the sites using black hat techniques by not showing them on search results."}

It is always on the wall of the Synagogue which faces towards Jerusalem.\nWhen the Ark is opened and the Torah removed for reading everyone stands in respect of God.

The coast is 27\u00a0km long, made up of rocks, of smooth cliffs and several bays: Arenella, Cannelle, Caldane and Campese, the biggest one with its little village of the same name.\nHistory.\nThe modern island was probably born 4.5 - 5 millions years ago, and people have lived there since the Iron Age. Later it was probably an Etruscan military stronghold. Under the Romans it was an important base in the Tyrrhenian Sea, written about, for example, by Julius Caesar in his \"De Bello Gallico\" and by the poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus.\nIn 805 it was given by Charlemagne to the abbey of the Tre Fontane in Rome, and was later a possession of Aldobrandeschi, Pannocchieschi, Caetani, Orsini families and the town of Perugia. In 1241 the Sicilian fleet of Emperor Frederick II destroyed a Genoese fleet. From 1264 Giglio was a Pisane dominion, from which it passed to the Medici. It suffered several Saracen attacks, which ended only in 1799.\nAlongside its history the island was always renowned for its mineral resources: many columns and edifices in Rome were built with the Gigliese granite.\nHow the island was.\nThe island has the remains of a Roman villa of Domitius Ahenobarbus (1st-2nd centuries), in the area of Giglio Porto. No traces of the Temple of Diana once existing now can be seen. The church of San Pietro Apostolo in Giglio Castello has an ivory crucifix believed to be by Giambologna\nIt is also site of an Etruscan shipwreck, dating to the early Iron Age, \"c.\" 600 BC. The cargo of the ship included copper and lead ingots, iron spits, amphorae and a Corinthian helmet. Even a wooden writing tablet with stylus was preserved. The finds are almost completely lost now.\nTransportation.\nIsola del Giglio is connected to Tuscany by ferries starting from Porto Santo Stefano and Orbetello Scalo."}

It was designed by Hughes Helicopters, but that later became McDonnell Douglas, which later became Boeing. It is designed to attack things on the ground to help soldiers. To do this, it can carry 16 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, along with rocket pods, and a 30mm chain gun that can fire 625 rounds per minute. It can carry 1,200 bullets. It can also carry missiles like the AIM-9 Sidewinder to shoot down things in the air if it is attacked by fighter aircraft or other helicopters.\nAH-64 details.\nThe AH-64 is 49.11 feet (14.97 meters) long, 17.16 feet (5.23 meters) wide, and 16.24 feet (4.95 meters) tall. Without anything, it weighs 11,799 pounds (5,352 kilograms). Full, it weighs 22,282 pounds (10,107 kilograms). It is powered by 2 General Electric T700-GE-701C engines. It can go 162 miles per hour (261 kilometers per hour), can fly 1,181 miles (1,900 kilometers) without refueling, can fly 9,478 feet (2,889 meters) high, and can climb 2,415 feet a minute (736 meters a minute).\nThe AH-64's users.\nThe AH-64 has been used by the United States. It was first used in Operation Just Cause. It has also been used by Israel, Japan, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Kuwait, Greece, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore.\nConcept and Building History.\nThe need of a new and highly secure helicopter was first felt in the beginning of the 1990s. The great military power, the British Army, identified this need and by February 1993 they finalised the need with an invitation to bid for the design, construction and trial of the new concept.\nAmong the bidding companies were: Boeing and Sikorsky with the RAH-66 Comanche, Agusta with the A129 Mangusta, British Aerospace and Eurocopter with the Tiger, GEC Marconi and Bell Helicopter the Cobra Venom, and Westland and McDonnell Douglas with the AH-64 Apache. The decision was taken later in July in 2005 and the winning aircraft builder was Westland and McDonnell Douglas with the Apache. One year later in 2006 the tow Parties signed a contract for 67 helicopters. This is how the WAH-64D Apache era started.\nThe 67 WAH-64D Apache attack helicopters were built by the merged companies Boeing and McDonnell Douglas (1997) and Westland between 1999 and 2004. The first aircraft was built by Boeing and delivered to the Army in March 1999, followed by the Westland, who built their first aircraft in 2000 and delivered in July 2000. The last aircraft was built and delivered in July 2004."}

{"id": "84534", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84534", "title": "Harry Potter (character)", "text": "Harry James Potter is the main character in J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" fantasy series. The books cover seven years in the life of the orphan who, on his 11th birthday, learns he is a wizard and the son of magical parents Lily and James Potter. He goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magic. Harry soon learns that he is already famous in the world of wizards. He also learns that his fate is connected to Lord Voldemort. Voldemort was an evil wizard who killed Harry's parents, but was believed to have died when he tried to use the Killing Curse on the baby Harry. Rowling said that the idea for the Harry Potter character came to her while riding on a train from Manchester to London in 1990. She decided to make him an orphan after the death of her mother.\nConcept and creation.\nAccording to author J. K. Rowling, the idea for both the \"Harry Potter\" books and the character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. J.K. Rowling said that in the hours she waited, her idea for \"this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.\" Rowling also decided to make Harry an orphan at a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained, \"Harry HAD to be an orphan - so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them \u2026 Hogwarts HAS to be a boarding school - half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that's what Hogwarts offers Harry.\"\nThe death of her mother on 30 December 1990 led Rowling led to write Harry Potter as a boy longing for his dead parents. His pain became \"more deeper, more real\" than in earlier versions because she related to it herself. In a 2000 interview with \"The Guardian\", Rowling also said that the character of Wart in T.H. White's novel \"The Sword in the Stone\" is \"Harry's spiritual ancestor.\" In that book, a boy called Wart meets the mysterious wizard Merlin. Merlin helps the child grow into a noble, powerful warrior who later becomes King Arthur. She also said that Harry was born on 31 July and has the same birthday as herself. However, she says, Harry is not directly based on any real-life character, \"he came just out of a part of me\".\nAppearances.\nFirst book.\nHarry first appears in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (published in the United States as \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\") as the book's protagonist, or main character. When Harry was a little over one year old, his parents were killed by the powerful Dark Wizard, Lord Voldemort. Harry survived Voldemort's Killing Curse after his mother died to protect him. The Curse was turned back at Voldemort and ripped his soul from his body. Because of this, Harry has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Rowling has said that creating the story about Harry Potter's past was a matter of reverse planning: \"The basic idea [is that] Harry \u2026 didn't know he was a wizard \u2026 and so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was\u2026 When he was one-year-old, the most evil wizard in hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry - he tried to curse him\u2026 Harry has to find out, before we find out. And - so - but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead, and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard who has been in hiding ever since\".\nHarry is written as an orphan living unhappily with his only family left, the cruel Dursleys. On his eleventh birthday, Harry finds that he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid tells him that he is to go Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he learns about his parents and his connection to the Dark Lord. He is \"sorted\" into Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat and becomes friends with classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Near the end of his first year at Hogwarts, he stops Voldemort's attempt to steal the Philosopher's Stone via Quirinus Quirrell. He also forms rivalries with characters Draco Malfoy, a classmate from an elitist wizard family, and the Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House, Severus Snape. Both feuds continue throughout the series. In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that Draco is based on several schoolyard bullies she had known and Snape on a teacher of hers who abused his power.\nRowling has said that the \"Mirror of Erised\" chapter in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" is her favourite. The mirror reflects Harry's deepest desire, namely to see his dead parents. Her favourite funny scene is when Harry accidentally sets a boa constrictor free from the zoo in the horrified Dursleys' presence.\nSecond to fourth books.\nIn the second book, \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\", Rowling pits Harry against Tom Marvolo Riddle, a memory of Lord Voldemort locked up in a secret diary that Ron's younger sister Ginny Weasley finds in a bathroom. When Muggle (non-magic) parentage students are found being petrified, many think that Harry may be the one behind the attacks, making him become more detached from his classmates. At the height of the book, Ginny Weasley is found to be missing. To rescue her, Harry battles Riddle and the monster he controls that is hidden in the Chamber of Secrets.\nIn the third book, called \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", Rowling uses time travel as the basis for the book. Harry learns that his parents were sold out to Lord Voldemort by their friend Peter Pettigrew, also accused of framing Harry's godfather Sirius Black for crimes he didn't make, locking him up in the wizarding prison, Azkaban. When Black escapes to find revenge, Harry and Hermione use a Time Turner to save him and a hippogriff named Buckbeak. Pettigrew, and the truth, escape from Sirius, causing him to be on the run from the authorities.\nIn the previous books, Harry is written as a child, but Rowling states that in the fourth novel, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", \"Harry's horizons are literally and metaphorically widening as he grows older.\" Harry's developing maturity becomes apparent when he becomes interested in Cho Chang, a pretty Ravenclaw student. Tension mounts, however, when Harry is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, even though another Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory, was already selected. It is actually an elaborate scheme by Lord Voldemort to lure Harry into a deadly trap. During the Tournament's final challenge, Harry and Cedric are teleported to a graveyard. Cedric is killed, and Lord Voldemort, aided by Peter Pettigrew, uses Harry's blood in a gruesome ritual to resurrect Voldemort's body. When Harry duels Voldemort, their wands' magical streams connect, forcing the spirit echoes of Voldemort's victims, including Cedric and James and Lily Potter, to be expelled from his wand through Priori Incancatem. The spirits shortly protect Harry as he escapes to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. For Rowling, this scene is important because it shows how Harry is brave, and by finding Cedric's corpse, he demonstrates selflessness and compassion. Says Rowling, \"He wants to save Cedric's parents additional pain\". She added that preventing Cedric Diggory's body from falling into Voldemort's hands is based on the classic scene in the \"Iliad\" where Achilles finds the body of his best friend Patroclus from the hands of Hector. The author said: \"That [Iliad scene] really, really, REALLY moved me when I read that when I was 19. The idea of the desecration of a body, a very ancient idea... I was thinking of that when Harry saved Cedric's body.\" She also said that she cried while writing the scene when Harry's dead parents are drawn from Voldemort's wand, the first time she cried while penning her story.\nFifth and sixth book.\nIn the fifth book, \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned. A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the latest Hogwarts' Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor (and Ministry spy). Because the paranoid Ministry thinks that Dumbledore is building a wizard army to overthrow them, Umbridge decides not to teach students real defensive magic. She gradually gains more power, eventually seizing control of the school. As a result, Harry's growing angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione. Rowling says she put Harry through extreme emotional stress to show his emotional vulnerability and humanity\u2013a contrast to his nemesis, Voldemort. \"[Harry is] a very \"human\" hero, and this is, obviously, a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately \"de\"humanised himself. And Harry, therefore, did have to reach a point where he did almost break down, and say he \"didn\u2019t\" want to play anymore, he \"didn\u2019t\" want to be the hero anymore \u2013 and he\u2019d lost too much. And he didn\u2019t want to lose anything else. So that \u2013 \"Phoenix\" was the point at which I decided he would have his breakdown.\" At Hermione's urging, Harry secretly teaches his classmates real defensive magic to thwart Umbridge and the Ministry, but their meetings are found and Dumbledore is ousted as Headmaster. Harry suffers another emotional blow, when his godfather, Sirius Black is killed during a battle with Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries, but Harry ultimately defeats Voldemort's plan to steal an important prophecy and helps uncover Umbridge's sinister motives. Rowling stated: \"And now he [Harry] will rise from the ashes strengthened.\" A sideplot of \"Order of the Phoenix\" involves Harry's romance with Cho Chang, but the relationship quickly unravels. Says Rowling: \"They were never going to be happy, it was better that it ended early!\"\nIn the sixth book, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that, Rowling says, is based on her and her younger sister's own difficult teenage years. Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harry's personal life: \"Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following, he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had\". This inexperience with romance was a factor in Harry's failed relationship with Cho Chang. Now his thoughts concern Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, a vital plot point in the last chapter when Harry ends their budding romance to protect her from Voldemort.\nA new character appears when former Hogwarts Potions master Horace Slughorn returns to replace Severus Snape, who takes over the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. Harry excels in Potions by using an old textbook once belonging to a talented student known only as, \"The Half-Blood Prince.\" The book contains many handwritten notes, revisions, and new spells; Hermione, however, believes Harry using it is cheating. Through private meetings with Dumbledore, Harry learns about Lord Voldemort's orphaned youth, his rise to power, and how he splintered his soul into Horcruxes to achieve immortality. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed, and Harry and Dumbledore locate another, although it is a fake. When Death Eaters invade Hogwarts, Snape kills Dumbledore. As Snape escapes, he proclaims that he is the Half-Blood Prince\u2013Harry's admired mentor is actually his hated enemy. It now falls upon Harry to find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes and to avenge Dumbledore's death. In a 2005 interview with NBC anchorwoman Katie Couric, Rowling stated that [after the events in the sixth book] Harry has, \"taken the view that they are now at war. He does become more battle hardened. He\u2019s now ready to go out fighting. And he\u2019s after revenge [against Voldemort and Snape].\"\nFinal book.\nIn \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", Harry, Ron and Hermione leave Hogwarts to complete Dumbledore's task: to search for and destroy Voldemort's remaining four Horcruxes, and then find and kill the Dark Lord. The three put themselves against Voldemort's newly formed totalitarian police state, an action that tests Harry's courage and moral character. According to J.K. Rowling, a telling scene in which Harry uses \"Cruciatus\" and \"Imperius\" (unforgivable curses for torture and mind-control) on Voldemort's servants shows a side to Harry that is \"flawed and mortal.\" However, she explains that, \"He is also in an extreme situation and attempting to defend somebody very good against a violent and murderous opponent\".\nHarry comes to recognise that his own single-mindedness makes him predictable to his enemies and often clouds his perceptions. When Severus Snape is killed by Voldemort later in the story, Harry realises that Snape was not the traitorous murderer he believed him to be, but a tragic anti-hero who was loyal to Albus Dumbledore. In Chapter 33 (\"The Prince's Tale\") Snape's memories show that he loved Harry's mother Lily Evans, but their friendship ended over his association with future Death Eaters and \"blood purity\" beliefs. When Voldemort killed the Potters, a grieving Snape vowed to protect Lily's child, although he loathed young Harry for being James Potter's son. It is also revealed that Snape did not kill Albus Dumbledore, but carried out Dumbledore's prearranged plan. Dumbledore, who was dying from a slow-spreading curse, wanted to protect Snape's position within the Death Eaters and spare Draco Malfoy from completing Voldemort's task to murder him.\nTo defeat Harry, Voldemort steals the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. It is the most powerful wand ever created, and he twice casts the Killing Curse on Harry with it. The first attempt merely stuns Harry into a deathlike state. In the chapter \"King's Cross\", Dumbledore's spirit tells Harry that when Voldemort failed to kill baby Harry and disembodied himself, Harry became an unintentional Horcrux; Voldemort could not kill Harry while the Dark Lord's soul shard was within Harry's body. Voldemort's second Killing Curse also fails because Voldemort used Harry's blood in his resurrection. Voldemort's soul shard within Harry was destroyed because Harry willingly faced death. In the next chapter, \"The Flaw in the Plan\", it is established that Harry, not Voldemort, became the Elder Wand's true master. In the book's climax, the Elder Wand disobeys the Dark Lord's command and rebounds the curse onto Voldemort, killing him. J.K. Rowling said, the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality, making him stronger than his nemesis. \"The real master of Death accepts that he must die, and that there are much worse things in the world of the living.\"\nAfter Voldemort's defeat, Harry joins the Auror Office for a revolutionised Ministry of Magic. Ten years afterwards, Harry is appointed department head by new Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt. Ron, who helped George run the Weasley Wizarding Wheezes Joke Shop for a time, is also an Auror. In the end, Rowling said his old rival Draco Malfoy has overcome his animosity after Harry saved his life three times in the seventh book.\nIn the \"Deathly Hallows\" epilogue, set nineteen years after Voldemort's death (i.e. 2017), Harry and Ginny are married and have three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lilly Luna.\nMovie appearances.\nIn the eight \"Harry Potter\" movies from 2001-2011, Harry Potter has been played by British actor Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe was asked to audition for the role of Harry Potter in 2000 by producer David Heyman, while in at a play titled \"Stones in His Pockets\" in London. The Harry Potter role has earned much money for Radcliffe. As of 2007, he has an estimated wealth of \u00a317 million.\nIn a 2007 interview with MTV, Radcliffe stated that, for him, Harry Potter is a classic coming of age character: \"That's what the movies are about for me: a loss of innocence, going from being a young kid in awe of the world around him, to someone who is more battle-hardened by the end of it.\" He also said that for him, important factors in Harry's psyche are his survivor's guilt about the death of his parents and his lingering loneliness. Because of this, Radcliffe talked to a bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role. Radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for Harry to die in the books, but he clarified that he, \"can't imagine any other way they can be concluded\". After reading the last book, where Harry Potter and his friends survive and have children, Radcliffe stated to be glad about the ending and lauded author J. K. Rowling for the conclusion of the story.\nRadcliffe stated that the most often repeated question he has been asked is how Harry Potter has influenced his own life, to which he regularly answers it has been \"fine\", and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role, but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray the character of Harry Potter.\nCharacterisation.\nAccording to author J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter is strongly guided by his own conscience, and has a keen feeling of what is right and what is wrong. Having \"very limited access to truly caring adults\", Rowling said, Harry \"is forced to make his own decisions from early age on.\" He \"does make mistakes\", she conceded, but in the end, he does what his conscience tells him to do. According to Rowling, one of Harry's pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric Diggory's body from arch villain Lord Voldemort, because it shows he is brave and unselfish.\nRowling also said that Harry's two worst character flaws are \"anger and occasional arrogance\", but that Harry is also innately honourable. \"He's not a cruel boy. He's competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't just lie down and take abuse. But he does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire.\" After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, being able to do what even Voldemort can not: he is not afraid of death.\nRowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. \"The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet [\u2026] if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.\"\nOutward appearance.\nRowling also gave Harry Potter an uncanny outward appearance. Throughout the entire series, Harry sports his father's perpetually untidy black hair, his mother's green eyes, and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead because of his encounter with Lord Voldemort and round, thick eyeglasses. She explained that this image simply came to her when she first thought up Harry Potter, seeing him as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy\".\nIn the books, Harry's scar serves as an indicator of Voldemort's presence: it burns when the Dark Lord is near or feeling particularly murderous or exultant. According to Rowling, by attacking Harry when he was a baby, Voldemort gave him \"tools (that) no other wizard possessed \u2013 the scar, and the ability it conferred, provided a magical window into Voldemort's mind.\" Asked why Harry's forehead scar is lightning bolt-shaped, Rowling said, \"to be honest, because it\u2019s a cool shape,\" and joked, \"I couldn\u2019t have my hero sport a doughnut-shaped scar.\"\nAbilities and interests.\nIn the books, Harry is categorised as a \"half-blood\" wizard in the series, because although both his parents were magical, his mother, Lily Evans, was \"Muggle-born\". According to Rowling, to characters for whom wizarding blood purity matters, Lily would be considered \"as loathsome as a Muggle\", and derogatively referred to as a \"Mudblood\".\nThroughout the series, Rowling wrote Harry Potter as a gifted wizard apprentice. She stated in a 2000 interview with \"South West News Service\" that Harry Potter is \"particularly talented\" in Defence Against the Dark Arts, and also good in Quidditch. Rowling said in the same interview that until about halfway through the third book, his good friend Hermione Granger \u2013written as the smartest student in Harry's year\u2013 would have beaten Harry in a magical duel. From the fourth book onwards, Rowling admits Harry has become quite talented in the Defence Against the Dark Arts and would beat his friend Hermione in a magical duel. His power is evident from the beginning of the series; specifically, Harry shows immediate command of a broomstick, produces a Patronus at an early age and survives several confrontations with Voldemort. Harry is able to speak and understand Parseltongue, a language associated with Dark Magic, which, according to Rowling, is because he harbours a piece of Lord Voldemort's soul. After Voldemort destroys that soul piece in the seventh book's climax, Harry loses the ability to speak Parseltongue. Harry \"is very glad\" to have lost this gift.\nAccording to Rowling, Harry's favourite book is \"Quidditch Through the Ages\", an actual book that Rowling wrote (under the pseudonym Kennilworthy Whisp) for the \"Comic Relief\" charity.\nPossessions.\nWhen Harry's parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort, they left behind a large pile of wizard's gold, used as currency in the world of magic, in a vault in the wizarding bank, Gringotts. This becomes Harry's source of paying for all of his Hogwarts textbooks, wizarding clothing, and spending money.\nAs is the case with most wizards in the Harry Potter series, his wand is among his most valued magical items. Harry's is made of holly, a wood Rowling chose because it is said to get rid of evil. It forms a deliberate contrast to the wand of his nemesis Lord Voldemort, whose wand is made of yew, which symbolises death. Rowling states she later learned that in the Celtic calendar a type of wood is assigned to each month; and Harry's fictional birthday (31 July) is linked to holly. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also happened to get wands made from the appropriate woods identified the Celtic calendar, according to their fictional birth months.\nAnother valued and useful possession is Harry's Cloak of Invisibility. In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he gets it anonymously as a Christmas gift. He later learns it was given by Albus Dumbledore, who had it in turn from Harry's father.\nHarry also owns half of a pair of two-way mirrors, given by his godfather Sirius Black, as a means of maintaining covert communications. In Book 7, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", when Harry and several friends are captured at Malfoy Manor, which Lord Voldemort was using as his headquarters, Harry uses the mirror to communicate with Aberforth Dumbledore, who sends rescue in the form of Dobby the House Elf.\nAfter Sirius' death, all of his remaining possessions were passed along to Harry. This included the Black family residence, located at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, and all the contents and furnishings of the house, including Kreacher (the old Black family House Elf). Harry also inherited the remainder of Sirius' wealth in wizard's gold at Gringotts.\nAnother notable possession of Harry's is a magical knife, given to him by Sirius Black. The knife has the power to open most mechanical locks and magical seals. The knife was destroyed when Harry attempted to use it on a lock in the Department of Mysteries, when instead of opening the desired lock, an enchantment destroyed the knife's blade.\nBy the end of \"Deathly Hallows\", Harry possesses all three Deathly Hallows: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand, They are three of the most powerful magical items in all of the wizarding-world. However, Harry lost the Resurrection Stone inside the Forbidden Forest, and decides to leave it there. Harry also takes the Elder Wand and lays it with Dumbledore's body, so the power of the wand might be extinguished if he dies a natural death.(In the movie, Harry destroys it by snapping it in half.) However, the new portrait of Dumbledore in the Headmaster's Office agrees that Harry should keep the Invisibility Cloak for himself, since it was his father's.\nThroughout most of the books, Harry also has a pet owl named Hedwig, used to deliver and get messages and packages. When Hedwig is killed in the seventh book, the author said she expected the strong emotional reaction of her readers: \"The loss of Hedwig represented a loss of innocence and security. She has been almost like a cuddly toy to Harry at times. I know that death upset a lot of people!\"\nFamily.\nIn the novels, Harry is the only child of James and Lily Potter, but orphaned as an infant. Rowling made Harry an orphan from the early drafts of her first book. She felt an orphan would be the most interesting character to write about. However, after her mother's death, Rowling wrote Harry as a child longing to see his dead parents again, incorporating her own anguish into him. Harry's aunt and uncle kept the truth about their deaths from Harry, telling him they died in a car accident. Through his marriage to Ginny Weasley, Harry links the Peverell and the House of Black families. It is unknown whether there have been other links between the two families' history, but this is possible, as they are among the most prominent wizarding families.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 2002, Harry Potter was voted No. 85 among the \"100 Best Fictional Characters\" by \"Book\" magazine and also voted the 35th \"Worst Briton\" in Channel 4's \"100 Worst Britons We Love to Hate\" program. In addition, Harry Potter is spoofed in the \"Barry Trotter\" series by American writer Michael Gerber, where a \"Barry Trotter\" appears as the eponymous anti-hero. On his homepage, Gerber describes Trotter as an unpleasant character who \"drinks too much, eats like a pig, sleeps until noon, and owes everybody money.\" The author stated \"[s]ince I really liked Rowling's books [\u2026] I felt obligated to try to write a spoof worthy of the originals.\"\nIn real life, Harry's iconoclastic appearance has become cult. According to halloweenonline.com, \"Harry Potter\" sets were the fifth-best selling Halloween costume of 2005. In addition, wizard rock bands like Harry and the Potters and others regularly dress up in the style of Harry Potter, sporting painted forehead scars, black wigs and round bottle top glasses.\nWizard rock is a musical movement dating from 2002 that consists of at least 200 bands made up of young musicians, playing songs about \"Harry Potter\". The movement started in Massachusetts with the band Harry and the Potters, who cosplay as Harry during live performances\nHarry Potter appears in the \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Nutcracker Sweet\" voiced by Seth Green. He is shown to have Firebolt in a delicate place on himself. Quinton Flynn voices Harry Potter in the episode \"Password: Swordfish.\" When the threat of the puberty creature Pubertis is known, Harry sees Dumbledore about this and receives a stone that might help him fight Pubertis. Upon confrontation with Pubertis, he rubs the stone two times, which summons ghosts to punch it. When it comes to the third time, (the stone starts \"chafing\") Dumbledore appears and tells Harry that the stone can only be warmed up three times (four if you take a week off) and that Pubertis cannot be destroyed since it lives in everyone.\nIn \"Epic Movie\", a 2007 parody movie, he is played by Canadian comedian Kevin McDonald, whereas Harry is portrayed as being somewhat of a pervert as seen when Harry tries to touch Susan Pevensie's breasts.\nEpisodes of \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\" has spoofed Harry as Nigel Planter. Unlike Harry, Nigel has an L-shaped scar on his forehead.\nIn an episode of \"\", Potter is referenced trice, once when Jimmy is watching a reel of movies rapidly (Where Hagrid says \"You're a Wizard, Harry\") and later in the filming for Jimmy's movie, as Jimmy plays a parody of Harry, called \"Terry Bladder\".\n\"Wizards of Waverly Place\" once referenced Harry, as Justin was wearing a robe and glasses like Harry, to which Alex comments on with trying to guess who he looks like (\"Barry something\", \"Jerry something\", etc.)"}

It is used primarily as a road surface. Pavement, (British English) generally refers to a sidewalk or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used. These surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways.\nHistory.\nIn 1984 Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of \"Little House on the Prairie\", while traveling in a wagon with her parents, wrote about the first time she saw pavement:\nThe first paved roads were created by the Carthaginians about 600 BC. The ancient Romeand destroyed Carthage but may have borrowed the idea of paved roads. They went on to build over of roads throughout their empire.\nThomas Telford (1757\u20131834) was a Scottish civil engineer. He is noted for building flat roads that required fewer horses to pull the wagons. His roads were well designed and supported heavy loads. John Loudon McAdam (1756\u20131836), was a Scottish engineer and road-builder. He invented a new process, \"macadamisation\", for building roads with a smooth hard surface that drained quickly. His roads were more durable and less muddy than soil-based roads.\nAsphalt.\nBy 1870, in the United States roads were being built using asphalt spread with rakes and made compact by steam rollers. In 1894, Clifford Richardson, an American engineer, determined that roads paved with asphalt did not contain enough coarse gravel. He produced a specification for the most durable pavement of the time.\nBy 1907, 1907 natural asphalt was being used less than petroleum-based asphalt for roads. Automobiles became more popular and more roads were needed. This created new methods of producing asphalt. World War II created a need for better and stronger pavement on which to land heavy aircraft.\nConcrete.\nThe ancient Romans were the earliest large-scale users of concrete. But after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, concrete was only used rarely. Concrete as a building material was redeveloped in the mid-18th century. One of the most significant uses of concrete pavement came about in the 1950s with the start of the Interstate Highway System in the US. There are about 45,000 miles of interstate highway in the US. About 60 percent is concrete."}

{"id": "84713", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84713", "title": "Tropical Storm Chris (2006)", "text": "Tropical Storm Chris was the fourth tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming on July 31 in the Atlantic Ocean east of the Leeward Islands from a tropical wave, Chris moved generally to the west-northwest, skirting the northern fringes of the Caribbean islands. Chris was a relatively short-lived storm, reaching a peak intensity with winds at 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on August 2, while positioned north of St. Martin. The storm gradually weakened before finally dissipating on August 5, near eastern Cuba.\nOverall impact was minimal, amounting to moderate amounts of rainfall throughout its path. No deaths were reported.\nStorm history.\nA tropical wave moved westward off the coast of Africa on July 27. At first, deep convection was spread throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly decreased the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235 miles (375\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbuda.\nForecasters originally predicted wind shear from an upper level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days. However, the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear, and the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing. The convection slowly covered the entire system, and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) while passing 50\u00a0miles (80\u00a0km) north of the northern Leeward Islands. The structure of Chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical, and an upper level eye feature developed early on August 2. Outflow improved in all quadrants, as well, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) shortly thereafter while located 120\u00a0miles (195\u00a0km) east of St. Thomas. Ins pite of the initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west-northwestward, upper level shear dissipated the well-defined inner core of the storm, and Chris started to weaken.\nEarly on August 3, strong wind shear over Chris removed the deep convection from the low level circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air. By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85\u00a0miles (135\u00a0km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. Late on August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again, though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Because of computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters mentioned the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) storm. However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure late on August 4. Late on August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions. The redevelopment never happened, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.\nPreparations.\nWhen the National Hurricane Center published its first advisory on Tropical Depression Three, the governments of Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the British Virgin Islands also gave out Tropical Storm Warnings for their respective territories. When the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Chris, Tropical Storm Warnings were also issued for Saba, Sint Eustatius, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, and Saint Martin. Three Royal Caribbean cruise ships changed their paths to avoid the storm. FEMA representatives coordinated with local emergency management officials in the United States Virgin Islands to determine if preparation necessities would be needed, such as hospital usage, shelters, and sand bags. In St. Thomas, all jet flights were cancelled in and out of the island, though small airlines were permitted to fly during the storm. Ferry service from Saint Martin to Anguilla was cancelled for a short period of time. Saint Martin officials recommended citizens to secure all loose items, for coastal residents to prepare for high surf, and for construction sites to secure all loose equipment. A small craft advisory was also issued for coastal waters of Saint Martin due to strong waves from the storm.\nOn August 1, officials in Puerto Rico issued a tropical storm warning for the island. The next day, approximately 600 tourists evacuated the islands of Vieques and Culebra. Citizens in Puerto Rico prepared for the storm by stocking up on supplies and visiting gas stations. On August 2, the government of the Bahamas issued a Hurricane Watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Acklins and Crooked Islands, Ragged Island, Inagua, and Mayaguana. In response to the threat, officials urged citizens to stock up on hurricane supplies, while boat owners in Staniel Cay secured their boats in preparation for the storm.\nIn response to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation of a threat to supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as part of the reasons in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around 1 year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested 10 mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.\nImpact.\nDamage caused by Tropical Storm Chris was minor and limited to just local flooding.\nSt. Thomas received brief amounts of heavy rain, with totals of over 3\u00a0inches (75\u00a0mm). Anguilla reported light rain and wind gusts of up to 21\u00a0mph (34\u00a0km/h). In St. John the storm caused peak wind gusts of 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h) along with moderately heavy rainfall of nearly 3\u00a0inches (75\u00a0mm), along with reports of lightning near the storm's center. Though impact was minimal in Saint Martin, Governor Franklyn Richards recognized the storm preparations served as a wake up call for citizens who were not ready for the hurricane season. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, the storm caused very little wind or rain. Convection dissociated from the center of the storm produced 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h) wind gusts and over 1.3\u00a0inches (33\u00a0mm) of rain in Culebra. Rainfall peaked at 3.09\u00a0inches (78\u00a0mm) in Fajardo. Rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks. The overflown waters temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island.\nRainfall reached up to 2\u00a0inches (50\u00a0mm) across portions of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and eastern Cuba, and reached 4\u00a0inches (100\u00a0mm) in some mountainous areas. In Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall caused severe flooding. Las Am\u00e9ricas reported 5.01\u00a0inches/127\u00a0mm of rainfall from Chris. Several people were left temporarily homeless from the flood waters entering their households. The flooding left many roads impassable near the capital city, and also resulted in landslides. The flooding also covered rice fields in the northeastern portion of the country. The National Office of Meteorology issued flood warnings for residents in low-lying areas and near rivers in the northeast and southeast portions of the country. Despite the flooding, overall damage was minor, and there are no casualties associated with Chris."}

In 1986, British magazine \"NME\" released a cassette, \"C86\", which defined much of the sound of what is today regarded as \"indie\" music, notably the usage of jangly guitar sounds, retro elements borrowing from 1960s rock bands, and a DIY, amateur-like sound.\nAccording to About.com, the term indie has two different general meanings in the UK and North America. In the UK, \"indie\" is a term used to describe \"melancholy\" and \"non-rock\" ballad-based music; in North America, on the other hand, \"indie\" is often used to refer to retro-sounding, \"twee\" and \"Anglophilic\" music.\nToday, indie rock has been able to find some commercial success. Popular indie rock acts and artists include R.E.M., Pavement, Regina Spektor and Superchunk, to name a few.\nAdditionally, indie rock has fused to create several new genres and subgenres. Indietronica, or indie electronic music, is a genre which fuses elements of indie rock, pop and electronic music, and often makes usage of synthesizers and drum machines. Alternative dance music, or indie dance, is also a genre which fuses elements of electronic dance music, alternative rock, indie rock and New Wave, usually incorporating elements of the rock genres and using them in a dance-based context."}

{"id": "84801", "revid": "1043157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84801", "title": "Chinese New Year", "text": "Chinese New Year, known in China as the SpringFestival and in Singapore as the LunarNewYear, is a holiday on and around the new moon on the first day of the year in the traditional Chinese calendar. This calendar is based on the changes in the moon and is only sometimes changed to fit the seasons of the year based on how the Earth moves around the sun. Because of this, Chinese New Year is never on January1. It moves around between January21 and February20.\nThe Chinese New Year is one of the most important holidays for Chinese people all over the world. Its 7th day used to be used instead of birthdays to count people's ages in China. The holiday is still used to tell people which \"animal\" of the Chinese zodiac they are part of. The holiday is a time for gifts to children and for family gatherings with large meals, just like Christmas in Europe and in other Christian areas. Unlike Christmas, the children usually get gifts of cash in red envelopes (\"hongbao\") and not toys or clothes. \nChinese New Year used to last 15 days until the Lantern Festival on the year's first full moon. Now, it is a national holiday in the Republic and People's Republic of China, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. It is also celebrated in some parts of Thailand. In some places, only the first day or three days are celebrated. In the PRC, nearby weekends are changed to create a 7-day-long \"Golden Week\". \nThe traditional new years in Vietnam (Tet) and in Korea (Korean New Year) are almost always on the same day as Chinese New Year but are sometimes different. The Japanese New Year used to work the same way but has been very different since some changes in the 19th century. Losar and Tsagaan Sar, the traditional Tibetan and Mongolian new years, are very close to the Chinese New Year but different ways of thinking about the moon's changes and adding months can make them happen weeks apart from the Chinese festival.\nName.\nThe Mandarin Chinese name of the holiday is \"Ch\u016bn Ji\u00e9\", which means \"Spring Festival\". This is why it is often called the \"Spring Festival\" by Chinese speakers of English, even though the holiday always occurs in the winter months of January or February. Its name is written in traditional Chinese writing and in the easier writing now used by mainland China and Singapore. The Republic of China began to use this name in the 1910s, after it began to use the European calendar for most things.\nBefore that, the holiday was usually just called the \"NewYear\". Because the traditional Chinese calendar is mostly based on the changes in the moon, the Chinese New Year is also known in English as the \"Lunar New Year\" or \"Chinese Lunar New Year\". This name comes from \"Luna\", an old Latin name for the moon. The Indonesian name for the holiday is Imlek, which comes from the Hokkien word for the old Chinese calendar and is therefore also like saying \"Lunar New Year\".\nAnother old name for the holiday was \"L\u00ecch\u016bn\", meaning \"Early Spring\". In Chinese, this is also a special name for the sun's place from about February4 to 19 each year, when the sun is 45 to 30\u00b0 ahead of its place on the 1stday of spring. The name is not often used to talk about the Chinese New Year any more. On Taiwan, the real \"Lichun\" has been called \"Farmer's Day\" since 1941. A year between two Chinese New Years without it is thought to be unlucky for marriages.\nDay of the New Year.\nChinese New Year always starts on a new moon, when the Moon is between the Earth and Sun and it looks all dark in the night sky. Because new moons happen about every 29.53 days but the year set by Pope GregoryXIII is 365.2425 days long, the Chinese holiday moves to different days each year. The Chinese calendar adds a 13th month every so often to keep the seasons in the right place, so the first day of the new year always happens between January21 and February20 on the 2nd or 3rd new moon after the 1st day of winter. The chart on the right gives the day of each Chinese New Year from 1996 to 2031.\nTraditional counting.\nIn the past, the Chinese emperors did not number their years from one place. Instead, they gave names to eras (groups of years) any time they wanted. Since they still changed its number at every new year festival, the first year of a new era might only be a few days long. One example of this is the \"1st year of Kaiyuan\" during the Tang, which lasted a week or so in 713. In the same way, people in China and around East Asia did not count their ages from zero or add one year at every birthday. They counted birth as the start of their 1st year and added another year upon the 7th day of the New Year, which they called People's Day (\"R\u00e9nr\u00ec\"). This came from an old story about how a goddess named N\u00fcwa made all the animals. The day she made people was used as the common birthday for everyone. In this way, people sometimes called a baby who born on the 6th day of the New Year a 2-year-old only a few hours after its birth. (Today, it is much more common in China to count age starting at zero and add years at birthdays, like in English-speaking countries.)\nAnimals of the New Year.\nThe Chinese used to keep time using 2 different lists of characters, known in English as the 10Heavenly Stems and the 12Earthly Branches. The stems were the 10 days of the week under the Shang dynasty, each with its own sun and a special gift to different dead family members of the king. The branches were parts of the almost 12-year path that Jupiter takes around the sun. Each is said to be yin (dark or female) or yang (bright or male), so that when they are put together they make a list of 60 pairs. (The current list began in 1984 and will end in 2043.) Later, each of the stems was also said to match one of the 5 Chinese elements\u2014wood, fire, dirt, metal, or water\u2014and each of the branches was said to be a different animal: Rat, Ox &amp; Cow, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster &amp; Chicken, Dog, and Pig. The Han Chinese list begins with the Year of the \"Wood Rat\"; the Tibetan list is much the same but begins with the Year of the \"Fire Rabbit\".\nToday, Chinese people don't use these lists to count hours, days, or years but many still pay attention to the animal of the year when someone was born. Just like with the European zodiac, some people think the year's animal can change how someone thinks and acts. They even think it can change whether a marriage will be a happy one or not. Newspapers pay writers to give them ideas for how lucky different animals will be during the coming week. Many parents even time their children's birth within a year or two to give them the best animal sign: a Chinese primary school might have full classrooms of \"golden Dragon\" students but noticeably fewer \"dirt Rats\". For those who do believe such things, it is important to notice that the traditional Chinese calendar's year starts at a different time from the usual year. People may say that 2017 is the \"Year of the Rooster and Chicken\" but the people born in January or early February 2018 will still be \"Roosters\" and \"Chickens\" and those born in the first few weeks of 2017 were still \"Monkeys\".\nHistory.\nChinese tradition said that the Chinese calendar began during the 60th year of the reign of the Yellow Emperor in 2637, with New Year celebrations beginning in that year. As far as we now know, it's much less old than that. Parts of the old ways of counting time given above are at least as early as 1250, during the Shang times. Most of it was known by the Zhou (11th\u20133rd centuries). The 5 elements and small points were set by the Han (2nd century\u20132nd century). From eastern China, the calendar and its new year spread to nearby places like Vietnam (111), Korea (before 270), Japan (604), and Tibet (around 641). It also followed the overseas Chinese to their new homes in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other places.\nThe Shang kings (16th\u201311th centuries) gave special gifts to their gods and dead family members during the winter of each year. Under the Zhou, people were having harvest festivals like today's Mid-Autumn Festival by about 1000. Over time, common people started to give gifts to their gods and their dead family members, just like the king. Parts of the harvest festival stopped being thanks and celebration of the last year. They moved to before the planting of the seeds and became wishes and celebration of good luck in the next year.\nBy the early Han, people were counting their birthdays from People's Day on the 7th day of the New Year. The order of animals' birthdays was said to be Roosters and Chickens on the New Year, Dogs on the next day, Pigs on the day after that, Goats on the 4th, Oxen and Cows on the 5th, Horses on the 6th, and then people. About the same time, people started burning bamboo to make loud noises to welcome the New Year and scare away bad things.\nPeople started carefully cleaning their homes, having large family dinners, and staying up late on the day before Chinese New Year by the end of the Three Kingdoms (3rd century). By the end of the Jin in the 5th century, these things had become a common part of Chinese life. Some Taoist magicians may have made gunpowder as early as the Han or Jin, but they certainly had it by the 9th century at the end of the Tang. Over the next few centuries, fireworks and firecrackers replaced burning bamboo as a way to chase away anything bad and to welcome in the New Year.\nDragon dances had appeared by the time of the Han. People thought that Chinese dragons like Yinglong and Shenlong were kinds of gods who had power over where the water in rivers and canals went and when the water in clouds would fall as rain. Because this was very important for farming, dragon dances could happen all through the year when rain was needed. Different parts of today's dragon dances began at different times, with some at least as old as the Song (about 1150) and others very new, like using special paint that glows under black light.\nLion dances were probably newer. China has not had its own lions since the spread of people out of Africa into the rest of the world. The earliest lions in Chinese books were gifts to the Han emperor from Parthia and other people who lived along the Silk Road connecting Chinese and Roman businesses. There was lion dancing under the Tang and in Japan by the 8th century, but people still thought of it as a foreign dance used by Buddhists. Today, people talk about \"Northern\" and \"Southern\" kinds of lion dances. The special northern kind began under the Southern Song (12th\u201313th century). The special southern kind began in Guangdong later, maybe under the Ming (14th\u201317th century).\nAs part of other changes, the Meiji Emperor of Japan ordered in 1873 that the new year celebrations of his country would be held on January1. Today, even most of the traditional Japanese celebrations now occur on that day, not at the same time as Chinese New Year. In 1928, the Nationalist Party of China tried to change the Chinese celebrations to January1, too, but this completely failed as the Chinese people protested or ignored the new laws and continued as usual.\nIn 1965, some people tried to change Indonesia's government, making its army less powerful. They failed and Suharto said they were working for Indonesia's Communists, who were working with Mao Zedong's Communist China. In 1967, Suharto helped make laws against using Chinese language or culture, including any celebration of Chinese New Year. These laws were not changed until after the fall of Suharto in 1998. Indonesia made Chinese New Year a national holiday for everyone a few years later in 2003.\nIn 1967, as part of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, the PRC's government did not celebrate or allow special time off work for the traditional new year. The State Council said that the people of China should \"change customs\" and have a \"revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival\". Public celebrations returned by the time of Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy in the 1980s. In particular, the government helped with dragon and lion dancing, thinking that it was part of the special culture of Chinese people. Since the year 2000, Chinese New Year has been one of the PRC's Golden Weeks: there are three days of paid time away from work during the first few days and two weekends around it are moved to make a 7-day-long holiday. These Golden Weeks copied a similar Japanese idea.\nIn 2015, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah set out tough new laws about the celebration of Chinese New Year in Brunei. This followed earlier laws like it about Christmas and is part of introducing traditional Islamic law to the country.\nEvents.\nMainland China.\nPeople in China usually try to be together with their family for at least the first few days of the holiday. Because of the large number of Chinese people and the many people who work away from their hometowns, all this \"spring traveling\" (\"chunyun\") is the biggest movement of people in the world every year.\nHouses are cleaned completely. In former times, sacrifices were made to the gods and dead family members in the days before the holiday. A \"reunion dinner\" happens in the evening of the last day of the traditional year (\"New Year's Eve\"). Older and married people give younger ones cash in red envelopes known as \"hongbao\" in Mandarin Chinese or \"laisee\" in Cantonese. China Central Television puts on a long show with many star actors, singers, and dancers. It is usually the most-watched TV show in the world each year. Lately, its ads have also become some of the world's most expensive, although they are still behind those during the US Super Bowl.\nChildren don't need to go to bed early and stay up to midnight. Around 12 o'clock, the new year is welcomed with public fireworks and private firecrackers. Children are told that these remember a monster called \"Nian\" (\"Year\") who was scared away by a town's loud noises and bright lights on a Chinese New Year long in the past. Some people call or send text messages and e-mails to say \"Happy New Year!\"\nDuring the first few days of the new year, many people visit the homes of their grandparents, parents, and other relatives, as well as their closest friends. More \"hongbao\" may be given. Temples also have special fairs with lots of street food. There are Peking opera and martial arts shows and lion and dragon dances in major cities. Lion dancers usually have two people inside each lion. People feed the lions green plants and \"hongbao\", and the lions keep the money and spit out the plants. The dragon dancers usually hold the Dragon up on poles and chase a pearl held by another dancer. The dragons can be very long. So far, the longest was in Hong Kong in 2012. That one was a little over long. Hong Kong also has special horse races at its racetrack. A 100,000 people sometimes come to the big race on the 3rd day of the New Year, which has a lion dance and other shows. Guangzhou has several special flower festivals.\nThe day of the new year's first full moon is called the Lantern Festival. Many streets and homes are decorated with old paper lanterns. In the past, this was one of the few days of the year when the women of families with lots of money could go outside their homes. They walked the streets nearby with their maids and could say hello to people outside their family. This still causes the festival to make people think of young adults meeting their future husband or wife.\nTaiwan.\nIn Taiwan, most events and traditions are the same as those in China. The most important special event is the Yanshui Beehive Fireworks Festival, where fireworks are shot straight into the people watching the show. Being hit is supposed to bring good luck, but this used to be very unsafe. Today, people wear special hard hats (helmets) and thick clothes to protect them from the fire and fireworks. Another special event is the \"Bombing of Master Handan\" in Taitung, where people throw firecrackers straight at the members of a parade who are wearing only red underwear and towels. Taiwan's Hakka people have a tradition like this, where firecrackers are thrown at dragon dancers as they parade through towns. The dragon is then burnt up at the end of the dance. Taipei's City Lantern Festival also goes on for most of the holiday, not just during the 1-day Lantern Festival at the end.\nPhilippines.\nChinese New Year is a national holiday in the Philippines. People do not get money without working, but anyone who \"does\" have to work on the \"special non-working day\" gets 130% of the usual pay. Binondo\u2014sometimes considered the world's oldest Chinatown\u2014sees a lot of traditional celebrations, such as lion and dragon dances. Its people also try to pay back any money that they owe before the New Year.\nIn 2001, Davao City stopped letting people use fireworks because its people were hurting themselves too much. Their leader Rodrigo Duterte became president of the country and said that he wanted to stop fireworks everywhere. As president, however, he has so far continued to let people use them.\nIndonesia.\nChinese New Year () is a 1-day national holiday in Indonesia. Chinese people have lived there since at least the 15th century, when Zheng He's ships visited its islands for the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, and many more came when the Netherlands held the islands as a colony. Suharto stopped Chinese Indonesians from celebrating Chinese New Year in 1967. Some people had tried to change the government in 1965 and Suharto said Indonesian Communists and their friends in the PRC had done it. Things changed after the fall of Suharto in 1998, and Indonesia made Chinese New Year a national holiday for everyone in 2003.\nNow that it is OK again, Chinese Indonesians celebrate the holiday much as people in China do. Dragon and lion dances are common at shopping centers, which sometimes have special sales to let Chinese people buy new (often red) clothes to wear for the holiday. People cannot use fireworks in most of Indonesia, but some cities like Jakarta let people use firecrackers. \nSome older Chinese traditions still survive in Indonesia. Like in the Philippines, people try to pay back any money they owe before the New Year. People also try not to lend any money during the holiday, because they think it will make them have to keep lending money for the whole year. Doors and windows are opened on the day before the New Year to \"let the old year out\", and people wake up early the next morning so they don't stay lazy the whole year. The red envelopes of money (Hokkien:\"\u00e2ng-pau\") are given on the morning of New Year's Day, not at dinner on the night before it. Many make special trips to one of Indonesia's Chinese temples at some time during the holiday.\nIt is also still common to leave some food at the table for dead family members and to give them gifts as the New Year begins. Chicken is usually eaten with the head, tail, and feet still on, showing \"completeness\". White rice is eaten but fresh white tofu is not, because in Chinese culture its color makes some people think of death and bad luck.\nMalaysia.\nMost of Malaysia gets two days off work for Chinese New Year: the New Year itself and the day after it. The largest celebrations happen around Petaling Street in Kuala Lumpur, at the Kek Lok Si Temple in George Town, in Ipoh, and on Jonker Street in Malacca. Some people still follow the tradition that the second day is used for married women to visit their parents, after visiting her husband's family on Chinese New Year's Day. Most Chinese Malaysians take the entire week off of work, despite the shorter length of the national holiday. Traditional Chinese use the 3rd day of the New Year to visit the resting places of family members who died in the last 3 years; people without a death in their family stay home. \nAn unusual tradition in Malaysia is the idea of \"open house\" dinners, especially on the 2nd and 3rd night of the holiday. Guests, friends, and even strangers from different races and religions can be let in to enjoy large dinners together. The Malaysian government even has its own \"open houses\" at community halls.\nIn addition to fireworks at the beginning of the New Year, many people light them on the 9th day of the holiday to celebrate the birthday of the Jade Emperor, the boss of the Chinese gods. The day was used for a special Hokkien New Year, the story going that, one time in the past, the Hokkien people had to hide from robbers for 8 days in a sugarcane field. Because of this story, lots of sugarcane is used for Malaysian decorations for Chinese New Year.\nTeochew-style Yusheng, a fish-and-noodle dish, is extra common in Malaysia, where it is called \"yeesang\" or \"prosperity toss\". A restaurant in Seremban started getting people to eat it by throwing it high in the air for good luck in the 1940s, and people had so much fun that they have done it ever since. Properly, it should have 7 parts and be eaten on the 7th day of the holiday, but people now eat it in different ways, too. Another common dish is \"steam boat\", a kind of seafood hot pot. As in other Chinese places, eating and giving away oranges and tangerines is common in Malaysia. A special tradition is for women with no boyfriend or husband to throw an orange into the sea to find a man. Some now write their telephone numbers on the oranges they throw, and men will use boats to go out and get the fruit.\nMany people in Malaysia who believe in Islam and Hinduism have also started giving red envelopes full of money\u2014which Malaysians call \"ang pow\" from its Hokkien name \"\u00e2ng-pau\"\u2014during their own holidays, like Eid (\"Syawal\") and Divali (\"Deepavali\"). The Islamic ang pow usually have Arabic designs, and the Hindu ones are often purple.\nSingapore.\nSingapore, like Malaysia, has a national holiday for Chinese New Year and the day after it. It also sees lot of \"steam boat\" hot pot dinners. In 1972, the government stopped people from using their own fireworks during the holiday. Worried that people would find the next celebration less fun, they began the Chingay Parade the next year in 1973. In 1977, Indians and Malays joined the parade, which happens on the 8th day of the New Year. The parade is now the biggest in Asia, with more than 10,000 people in it and floats that showing every animal of the circle of Chinese years and the money god Cai Shen. More than 100,000 come to see it in person, and millions of people see it on TV. There are still government firework shows, and the people of Singapore now make noise during the holiday by hitting bamboo sticks together.\nHoliday shopping and street shows are centered on Chinatown. Its Wishing Tree is filled with cards that tell people's hopes and dreams. The money from selling the cards is used for the area's activity center for the old.\nDowntown, the holiday is used as a showcase for Chinese arts and customs. The Chinese Festival of Arts starts on the 5th day and runs for the rest of the holiday until the Lantern Festival. The National Gallery, Stamp Museum, and Asian Civilizations Museum let people in for free on some of the days of the holiday. For more than 10 years, Singapore has held a big lion dancing contest with teams coming from other countries across Southeast Asia. During the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the New Year, there is the River Hongbao show on the Marina Bay Floating Platform and along the waterfront.\nBrunei.\nChinese New Year, the day before it, the day after it, and the Lantern Festival are national holidays in Brunei. The country has had a large number of Chinese people since the 1930s and 40s, and the sultan sometimes comes to their New Year celebrations. Since 2015, however, Brunei has set out tough Islamic laws that try to stop Muslims from joining or even seeing the Chinese celebrations. Lion dances are allowed only at the last Chinese temple in Brunei, at Chinese schools, and at the homes of the Chinese. Only Chinese people can join the dance. People cannot use fireworks or firecrackers, and dances must stop during the hours of Islamic prayers. Breaking these rules risks as much as B$20,000 and 5 years of jail.\nKorea.\nThe Chinese New Year celebrations in North and South Korea are known as Korean New Year. The time in Beijing is 1 hour different from the time in the Korean capital cities of Pyongyang and Seoul. About one time every 24 years, this makes the Korean New Year start on the day after the Chinese New Year. \nThe Korean holiday is very close to the Chinese one, with families gathering, children being very nice to their parents and grandparents, and older people giving gifts of money to the young. The Korean holiday has different traditional foods and games, though.\nVietnam.\nThe Chinese New Year celebrations in Vietnam are known as Tet. Like the Korean New Year, it sometimes happens on a different day. In 1967, North Vietnam changed its time so that its capital Hanoi is now 1 hour different from Beijing. This means that the new moon happens a day earlier in Vietnam about one time every 24 years. Vietnamese people also add a 13th month to their calendar at a different time from the Chinese, who always try to put the 1st day of winter in their 11th month. In some years, this makes Tet happen in the month after the Chinese New Year.\nLike in Korea, the Vietnamese New Year is mostly the same as China's, with families gathering, children saying nice things to their parents and grandparents, and older people giving gifts of money to the young. There are some different foods and traditions, like their New Year tree or special games. Some of the differences come from changes in China: Tet sees more people do nice things for their dead family members. In China, most of the traditions like that were moved to Tomb Sweeping Day at the beginning of April.\nOther places.\nThe largest US and Canadian celebrations happen in Chinatowns. People eat Chinese food, give gifts, and have dragon parades that sometimes include marching bands. There is no national holiday with time off work, but different events go on for the full traditional 2 weeks up to the Lantern Festival.\nIn the United Kingdom, the celebration in London's Chinatown and Trafalgar Square drew 500,000 people in 2015.\nThe holiday is also so important to China that many world leaders will take time to send their good wishes to China and the Chinese people.\nCustoms.\nMost traditional customs have to do with getting more good luck for the new year and staying away from anything unhappy. \nPeople hang up decorations, especially pairs of Chinese poems (couplets) on either side of their doors. Some put pictures of Taoist gods on the doors to scare away bad things. Live plants suggest growth, and flowers suggest coming fruits. Pussy willow is common in some places because its Chinese name sounds like \"money coming in\". It is very common for big decorations to look like the animal for the new year, so that 2017 had Rooster and Chicken pictures and statues and 2018 will have Dogs.\nPeople used to welcome the New Year with \"anything\" that made loud noises, including drums, cymbals, or even woks and pots. The exact traditions were different in different parts of China. Fireworks and firecrackers became more and more common everywhere, but lately many places have stopped letting most people use them because of the danger of people hurting themselves, of fire, and of dirt in the air that can make people sick. There are still big firework shows in most big cities with many Chinese people, but the city government will do everything and other people just watch.\nVisits to people's houses are done in new or well-kept clothes. People wear more red than usual, which makes them think of happy times like weddings, and wear less black and white, which makes some think of sad times like funerals. Red underwear is very common and is most commonly worn during New Years which have the same animal as the wearer's birth year (so, at ages 12, 24, 36, and so on). In Malaysia, it has even become common to give people such red underwear as gifts and for non-Chinese to wear all-red clothes during the season of the Chinese New Year.\nThere are some common things people say to wish good luck to each other, the most important being \"g\u014dngx\u01d0 f\u0101c\u00e1i\" (\"congratulations that you are now rich\"). People try not to say bad words, tell ghost stories, or talk about death. Some even stay away from the number four, which sounds like \"death\" in Chinese. Crying babies are also thought to be bad luck, and family members will try to keep children happy during visits.\nThere are some old customs that only a few people or even no one does any more. People still do their \"spring cleaning\" before the holiday but, in old China, they didn't sweep or wash clothes on New Year's Day itself. They were afraid of cleaning away good luck together with the dirt. For the same reason, some people did not wash their hair and were very careful not to break any tools. The 5th or 6th day after New Year, when they cleaned and threw away or burned all the trash, was a day for \"sending off\" the God of Being Poor, one of the sons of Zhuanxu. Today, it's more common to clean things as they get dirty, like on other days. Few do anything special about the God of the Poor. In the same way, people near Beijing thought that it was unlucky to cook or steam food for the first 5 days of the New Year. They would cook all of their next week of food 2 days before it, so it was ready for the reunion meal. They'd add yeast to their dumpling skins the day before that, on the 28th day of the 12th month. The skins would have enough time to be ready but not enough time to go bad. Today, people cook or eat out all through the week. It is easy to buy ready-made skins at supermarkets, keep their homemade skins fresh in fridges, or just buy all their dumplings from nearby shops and there is nothing special about the 28th day. On People's Day, the 7th day of the holiday, people used to wear special headbands and thought good weather meant good luck for everyone in the coming year. Everyone used it to count their age, even when it was not their birthday. None of that is common any more.\nSome traditions have been ended by the Chinese government. People used to run to be the first to set off fireworks and firecrackers at the beginning of the New Year at midnight, wherever they were. The dirty air this caused in big Chinese cities made children and old people sick. Now, the police stop people from doing this in many cities.\nTaoist traditions that are less common now are giving gifts to the home's kitchen god on the 23rd or 24th day of the 12th month of the old calendar. People said the kitchen god watched the house for the Jade Emperor, the boss of the Chinese gods. The special decorations and gifts were given to him so that he would say nice things. The gods would then be nicer to the house for the next year. The kitchen god was thought to return to the house on the 4th day of the New Year. During the time he was \"away\", people used to feel they could get away from some hard rules about family life without anything bad happening. In the past, love matches would marry during those days with less rules and expense than a full wedding. Today, the days after the Chinese New Year are a common time for weddings but this is because everyone has time off work and not because of any ideas about luck or worry about the gods. In the same way, people used to give animals to Cai Shen, the god of money, on the 2nd or 5th day of the holiday. People used to take a break from visits on \"Red Dog Day\" (\"Ch\u00ecg\u01d2u R\u00ec\"), the 3rd day of the holiday, when an angry god was said to bring bad luck to anyone walking around outside. Now, fewer and fewer people worry about those things.\nFood.\nThe reunion dinners on the day before Chinese New Year are often the largest and most expensive of the year. Some families use special and expensive foods to gain face; others use meaningful foods to bring luck. Jiaozi (a kind of dumpling) are common in northern China. People think they look like the old Chinese silver bars and hold luck inside. Egg rolls and spring rolls like lumpia can also be made to look like golden bars, and oranges and tangerines are thought to look like gold coins. Noodles like \"y\u012bmi\u00e0n\" or Filipino pansit are eaten uncut to wish for long life. Some dishes are eaten because their Chinese names sound like lucky words, such as \"fish\" and \"well-off\". In Cantonese, \"vegetable\" sounds the same as \"having money\" (\"choy\") and \"leek\" sounds the same as \"counting-and-planning\" (\"suan\"). Because of this Cantonese people in China and in other countries try to have some during the New Year holidays. Niangao, called \"tikoy\" in the Philippines, is a kind of cake made from fried sticky rice and sugar. It is very common in southern China. In Chinese, its name sounds like \"ni\u00e1n g\u0101o\" (\"the year gets better\") or \"ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n g\u0101osh\u0113ng\" (\"getting better year after year\"). Some people also think its stickiness is like a glue and use it as a wish for holding their family together. Indonesians call their niangao \"basket cakes\" because they mold theirs in bamboo baskets. They also have some special flavors in addition to vanilla and chocolate like pandan, a tree with good-smelling leaves. Some people fry tikoy with eggs; basket cakes are often steamed with pieces of coconut meat. Because most Chinese people in the Philippines speak Hokkien and not Mandarin Chinese, they also like to eat pineapples. In Hokkien, the word for \"pineapple\" sounds like the word for \"having a lot of money\".\nSome Chinese also put out \"Trays of Togetherness\", dishes with eight different parts and eight different kinds of snack foods. Some common things to put in these trays are kumquats, longans, pieces of coconut meat, peanuts, candies, and melon and lotus seeds. Eight is a lucky number to many Chinese people, like seven in Europe and other places. These dishes are very common among Malaysian and Indonesian Chinese.\nFor the Lantern Festival, the special food is yuanxiao, small balls of sticky rice in a sweet soup. Lichun always happens near the Chinese New Year as well. It is celebrated by eating spring pancakes (\"ch\u016bnb\u01d0ng\")."}

The pieces are usually dance movements. The French word \u201csuite\u201d means \u201ca sequence\u201d of things, i.e. one thing following another.\nIn the 17th century many composers such as Bach and Handel wrote suites. They were collections of dances: usually an allemande, a courante, a sarabande and a gigue. Sometimes other dances were included as well, e.g. a minuet, gavotte, passepied or bourree. Sometimes the first movement was not a dance movement but an introduction. It may have been called a prelude or even overture. Some of Bach\u2019s suites were called \"Partitas\". The French composer Fran\u00e7ois Couperin called his suites \"Ordres\".\nBach wrote suites for orchestra which he called \"overtures\". Handel wrote two very famous collections of dance movements for orchestra: \"Water Music\" and \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\". These are also suites although they are not given that title. He also wrote 22 suites for keyboard, and Bach wrote \"French Suites\", \"English Suites\" and \"Partitas\" for keyboard as well as partitas for unaccompanied violin and suites for unaccompanied cello.\nEarlier composers, e.g. Renaissance composers, had also written suites, but the word \u201csuite\u201d was not used until around the middle of the 17th century.\nBy the 1750s composers had stopped writing suites. They were more interested in the symphony and concerto, \nIn the late 19th century, the word \"suite\" started to be used again. Composers who had written opera's or ballets with lots of popular dance movements often made an arrangement of these movements for orchestra so that it could be played at concerts. Tchaikovsky wrote the \"Nutcracker Suite\" which includes the most popular dances from his ballet \"The Nutcracker\". Some composers used the word \"suite\" for pieces with movements which had a common theme: Gustav Holst called \"The Planets\" a suite, as each movement is about one of the planets. French composers of the Impressionist period such as Ravel and Debussy wrote suites for piano."}

It includes horses, asses, and zebras. \"Equus\" is the only living (extant) genus of horses, and there are seven living species. They are the one-toed horses, and are adapted for living in various types of grasslands.\nThe term equine refers to any member of this genus. \"Equus\" has many extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants. They can live on low-quality vegetation.\nFeral equine populations are widespread, but wild equines are found only in Africa and Asia. Wild populations may have a harem system. In this case one adult male or \"stallion\", several females or \"mares\" and their young or \"foals\". Otherwise they live in a territory where males control territories with resources that attract females. In both systems, females take care of the foals, though males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra is still widespread and abundant.\nThe one-toed horses of the grasslands developed from smaller three-toed horses which lived more in forests and wooded savannahs. Before the coming of humans, horses were much more varied and widespread, though the number of species is not known.\nLiving horses.\nThere are seven species of living horses in the wild. They are:\n\"E. africanus\"\u2014African wild ass\n\"E. ferus\"\u2014wild horse\n\"E. grevyi\"\u2014Gr\u00e9vy's zebra\n\"E. hemionus\"\u2014onager\n\"E. kiang\"\u2014kiang\n\"E. quagga\"\u2014plains zebra\n\"E. zebra\"\u2014mountain zebra\nThis is not counting the many types of horse which mankind has modified by breeding. \"Equus ferus\" has been the species used by man as the basis of the various breeds of horse."}

In the 3rd to 4th century, Arezzo became an episcopal place: it is one of the few cities whose succession of bishops are known by name without interruption to the present day, in part because they were the feudal lords of the city in the Middle Ages.\nUntil 1384, Arezzo was an independent city-state, generally Ghibelline in tendency, thus opposing Guelph Florence. In 1252 the city founded its university, the \"Studium\". Arezzo in 1384 was under Florentine domination. During this period Piero della Francesca worked in the church of San Francesco di Arezzo producing the splendid frescoes.\nIn the 18th century the neighbouring marshes of the Val di Chiana, south of Arezzo, were drained and the region became less malarial. At the end of the century French troops led by Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Arezzo, but the city soon turned into the hands of the resistance against the invaders with the movement of \"Viva Maria\": this gained the city the role of provincial capital. In 1860 Arezzo became part of the Kingdom of Italy.\nSquares.\nThe Piazza Grande is the most noteworthy medieval square in the city, it is currently the site of the \"Giostra del Saracino\" (\"Joust of the Saracin\")."}

Lava, rocks, dust, and gas compounds are some of these \"ejecta\".\nEruptions can come from side branches or from the top of the volcano. Some eruptions are terrible explosions that throw out huge amounts of rock and volcanic ash and can kill many people. Some are quiet outflows of hot lava. Several more complex types of volcanic eruptions have been described by\u00a0volcanologists. These are often named after famous\u00a0volcanoes where that type of eruption has been seen. Some volcanoes may show only one type of eruption during a period of activity, while others may show a range of types in a series.\nVolcanic Explosivity Index.\nThe Volcanic Explosivity Index (commonly shortened VEI) is a scale, from 0 to 8, for measuring the strength of eruptions. It is used by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program to assess historic and prehistoric lava flows. It works in a way similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes: each interval in value is a tenfold increase in magnitude (it is logarithmic). Most volcanic eruptions are of VEIs between 0 and 2.\nVolcanic eruptions by VEI index"}

It goes from Northern California, through Oregon and Washington, and ends in British Columbia, Canada. The range includes the Western Cascades in northern California and the North and Canadian Cascades in Washington State and Canada. \n in the Pacific Ocean Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean. Volcanos in the range include Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, and Mount Shasta. The Cascades are part of the \"American Cordillera\", the almost continuous spine of mountains which runs right down the western side of the Americas.\nThe highest mountain in the cascades is Mount Rainier at 14,411 feet or 4,392 metres. \nGeology.\nThe Cascade range was formed by thousands of small, short-lived volcanoes that built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens, that dominate the landscape.\nThe fundamental reason for all these mountains on the western side of the Americas is the steady movement of the great landmasses away from Eurasia and Africa. The process of continental drift is fuelled by the production of sea-floor material at the mid-Atlantic trench. The landmasses of the Americas have buckled the edges of the Pacific plates, resulting in the continual volcanic build-up of mountains on the western side of the continents. The Cascade Volcanic Arc made its first appearance 36 million years ago. The major volcanic peaks today were born in the last 1.6 million years. More than 3,000 vents erupted during the most recent volcanic episode that began 5 million years ago. As long as subduction continues, new Cascade volcanoes will continue to rise.\nAs the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes."}

It is the capital city of the district. The town was founded in the Middle Ages. It is in the Seetal valley, about south of the Aare delta. Lenzburg and the municipalities of Niederlenz and Staufen have merged over time. The city name refers to the name of the castle which can be translated as \"spring castle\".\nAs of 31 December 2010, Lenzburg about 8,341 people lived in Lenzburg. Lenzburg is about west of Z\u00fcrich. Many people living in Lenzburg go to Z\u00fcrich to work.\nGeography.\nThe district of in area is in a valley between two ranges of minor limestone mountains which rise about above the otherwise flat valley. The two major mountains are W\u00e4hrend der Schlossberg at above sea-level with a diameter of only , and the nearby Goffersberg at above sea-level which is only long and has a broad plateau wide. Lenzburg grew together with the nearby communities into a regional area\nNearby municipalities are Rupperswil in the northwest, Niederlenz and M\u00f6riken Wildegg in the north; Othmarsingen in the northeast, Hendschiken in the east, Ammerswil in the southeast, Egliswil the south, Seon in the southwest as well as Staufen in the west.\nHistory.\nThe area has a long history. A neolithic cemetery with 16 chambered tombs built about 3,800 years ago was found near the castle in 1959.\nA Roman theatre was uncovered when the motorway was built in 1964. It was built about 100 AD. It could seat an audience of about 4,000 people. It was part of a small village of 400 to 600 people that existed for about 200 years. The village was built on either side of the road for a distance of about 400 metres. There were shops, taverns, and small factories making wood and leather products. Behind these building were houses and farms. It is possible that there was a small fort in the village. The first buildings were wooden but these were destroyed in a fire at the end of the first century. The new buildings were made of stone. The village was abandoned in the 3rd century.\nIn the 5th and 6th centuries, an Alamanni village existed. The oldest registered usage of the name \"Lencis\" (from which Lenzburg derives) is from 893. In 1036, Castle Lenzburg became the seat for the count of Lenzburg, then an important lord. The family died out in 1173, and the castle was then owned by emperor Frederick Barbarossa. After this, it was mainly used by the Kyburger house. The Habsburgs took over the castle in 1273.\nCity rights were granted in 1306. Lenzburg was conquered by Bern in 1415, along with the western part of what is now Aargau. Bern did not take away its city rights. In 1433, the city of Bern bought the castle and used it to govern the area from 1444 to 1798. A major fire ruined the town in 1491. Only fifteen houses were not destroyed. The reformation was carried out at the same time with the rest of the region in 1528. The economy started to move slowly from a farming economy to a more industrial one in the 16th century. A textile factory was founded in 1732.\nIn 1798, the Helvetian Republic was made and the lords from Bern were removed. The canton of Aargau was founded and Lenzburg became the capital of the district in 1803. The canton gained the castle in 1804. Lenzburg became the economic center of the area in the 19th century. In 1875, Lenzburg was added to the railway system. Competition for trade became too much and Lenzburg became bankrupt only one year later. The town recovered from bankruptcy during the next 10 years.\nIn 1886, the German playwright, Frank Wedekind lived in the castle which his father had bought. It was sold in 1892 to August Edward Jessup from Philadelphia who spent a lot of money restoring the castle. He sold it to a Chicago banker, James W. Ellsworth in 1911. Ellsworth's son, Lincoln Ellsworth and Roald Amundsen used the castle to plan their polar explorations in the 1920s.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe main place to see in the town is the Lenzburg castle. It was built in the 11th century and has been added onto several times. Lenzburg is among the oldest and most important high-castles in Switzerland. Some of the city wall has been kept and is now under protection. Some interesting buildings are in the old part of town. These include:\nEconomics.\nLenzburg is an important economic centre. It contains over 800 companies. Most of the businesses are small to medium sized, but some worldwide companies are established in Lenzburg, for example the global Asea Brown Boveri (ABB). About 6,000 people work in Lenzburg.\nTransportation.\nLenzburg is a good place for transportation. It is about from Z\u00fcrich with access to the A1, Switzerland's most important motorway. Two main axes of traffic cross in Lenzburg, one running from Waldshut to Lucerne and the other running from Zurich to Berne.\nSome of the trains from Zurich to Berne stop in Lenzburg. Lenzburg is part of the Suburban rail system of Zurich. Other trains connect the city to Brugg, Lucerne, Zofingen and Zug. The line to Wettingen was closed, because of low traffic. The trains were replaced by a commuter line from Zurich (which runs to Aarau).\nZ\u00fcrich International Airport is close to the town of Lenzburg. The local bus \"Regionalbus Lenzburg\" leads to the municipalities of Brunegg, Dintikon, M\u00f6riken-Wildegg, Schafisheim and Seengen. Lenzburg has an urban bus system as well.\nEvents.\nFor over 400 years, the youth celebration (\"Jugendfest\") is the largest event in Lenzburg. It takes place every year on the second Friday of July. In August, the \"Gauklerfestival\" takes place in the streets of the old part of town with food and entertainment on the streets of the city."}

In the year 45 BC, a few kilometers west, the village Augusta Raurica was made, the first Roman town in Switzerland, near modern Kaiseraugst. Towards the end of the 4th century, a fort was built at the western settlement.\nDuring the 17th century, there was very little time during which the city enjoyed peace. During the Rappenkrieg (a peasant uprising that lasted from 1612 until 1614), the city was ruined. Between 1633 and 1638, the Thirty Years' War reached Fricktal, where Rheinfelden played a big role. On 15 July 1633, Swedish and French troops ruined the city. On 5 February 1638, the city was put under attack by Protestant troops sent by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. On 28 February, the Battle of Rheinfelden began, as the city was attacked by the bigger Imperial and Bavarian troops sent by Johann von Werth and Federigo Savelli. The Protestants lost this battle and moved on. Bernhard brought them weapons, but in the second passage on 3 March they were defeated, as he and his men unexpectedly re-appeared on the battlefield, with Savelli and Werth falling into captivity.\nBy the end of the Thirty Years' War, the Austrians had built a fortress on the island to secure the southwestern border of the Breisgau. In 1678, French troops sent by Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy fired at the city. In 1745, during the War of the Austrian Succession, the French made a fortress on the same ground and also ruined part of the city wall. On 17 July 1796, Rheinfelden was again occupied and looted by the French.\nBecause of the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, the Fricktal became a protectorate of the French, making the front line between the French Revolutionary and the Austrian troops in the War of the Second Coalition. On 20 February 1802, Rheinfelden was made the capital city of the new Canton of Fricktal, joining the Helvetic Republic in August, the point at which the city became mostly Swiss. The seat of the cantonal government was here instead of in Laufenburg. With the beginning of the \"Reichsdeputationshauptschluss\" (the German Mediatisation), Napoleon Bonaparte removed the canton of Fricktal. Since 19 March 1803, Rheinfelden has been the capital of the district of the same name, in the canton of Aargau."}

The best known is the Platonic, convex regular icosahedron.\nRegular icosahedra.\nThere are two objects, one convex and one concave, that can both be called regular icosahedra. Each has 30 edges and 20 equilateral triangle faces with five meeting at each of its twelve vertices. Both have icosahedral symmetry. The term \"regular icosahedron\" generally refers to the convex variety, while the nonconvex form is called a \"great icosahedron\".\nConvex regular icosahedron.\nThe convex regular icosahedron is usually referred to simply as the \"regular icosahedron\", one of the five regular Platonic solids, and is represented by its Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3, 5}, containing 20 triangular faces, with 5 faces meeting around each vertex.\nIts dual polyhedron is the regular dodecahedron {5, 3} having three regular pentagonal faces around each vertex.\nGreat icosahedron.\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four regular star Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. Its Schl\u00e4fli symbol is {3, }. Like the convex form, it also has 20 equilateral triangle faces, but its vertex figure is a pentagram rather than a pentagon, leading to geometrically intersecting faces. The intersections of the triangles do not represent new edges.\nIts dual polyhedron is the great stellated dodecahedron (, 3), having three regular star pentagonal faces around each vertex.\nStellated icosahedra.\nStellation is the process of extending the faces or edges of a polyhedron until they meet to form a new polyhedron. It is done symmetrically so that the resulting figure retains the overall symmetry of the parent figure.\nIn their book \"The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra\", Coxeter et al. enumerated 58 such stellations of the regular icosahedron.\nOf these, many have a single face in each of the 20 face planes and so are also icosahedra. The great icosahedron is among them.\nOther stellations have more than one face in each plane or form compounds of simpler polyhedra. These are not strictly icosahedra, although they are often referred to as such."}
{"id": "85013", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85013", "title": "Octahedron", "text": "An Octahedron is a polyhedron made of eight faces. in the case of the regular octahedron, these faces are triangles. The ocahedron looks like two pyramids, which share the same base. \nIn chemistry, octahedra are common: diamonds and fluorite are examples of crystals that are octahedra.\nRegular octahedron.\nDimensions.\nIf the edge length of a regular octahedron is \"a\", the radius of a circumscribed sphere (one that touches the octahedron at all vertices) is\nand the radius of an inscribed sphere (tangent to each of the octahedron's faces) is\nwhile the midradius, which touches the middle of each edge, is\nOrthogonal projections.\nThe \"octahedron\" has four special orthogonal projections, centered, on an edge, vertex, face, and normal to a face. The second and third correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes.\nSpherical tiling.\nThe octahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.\nCartesian coordinates.\nAn octahedron with edge length can be placed with its center at the origin and its vertices on the coordinate axes; the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are then\nIn an \"x\"\u2013\"y\"\u2013\"z\" Cartesian coordinate system, the octahedron with center coordinates (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") and radius \"r\" is the set of all points (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") such that\nArea and volume.\nThe surface area \"A\" and the volume \"V\" of a regular octahedron of edge length \"a\" are:\nThus the volume is four times that of a regular tetrahedron with the same edge length, while the surface area is twice (because we have 8 rather than 4 triangles).\nIf an octahedron has been stretched so that it obeys the equation\nthe formulas for the surface area and volume expand to become\nAdditionally the inertia tensor of the stretched octahedron is\nThese reduce to the equations for the regular octahedron when\nGeometric relations.\nThe interior of the compound of two dual tetrahedra is an octahedron, and this compound, called the stella octangula, is its first and only stellation. Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. rectifying the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron relate to the other Platonic solids. One can also divide the edges of an octahedron in the ratio of the golden mean to define the vertices of an icosahedron. This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedron's edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. There are five octahedra that define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together they define a \"regular compound\".\nOctahedra and tetrahedra can be alternated to form a vertex, edge, and face-uniform tessellation of space, called the octet truss by Buckminster Fuller. This is the only such tiling save the regular tessellation of cubes, and is one of the 28 convex uniform honeycombs. Another is a tessellation of octahedra and cuboctahedra.\nThe octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess mirror planes that do not pass through any of the faces.\nUsing the standard nomenclature for Johnson solids, an octahedron would be called a \"square bipyramid\". Truncation of two opposite vertices results in a square bifrustum.\nThe octahedron is 4-connected, meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected simplicial well-covered polyhedra, meaning that all of the maximal independent sets of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the pentagonal dipyramid, the snub disphenoid, and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.\nUniform colorings and symmetry.\nThere are 3 uniform colorings of the octahedron, named by the triangular face colors going around each vertex: 1212, 1112, 1111.\nThe octahedron's symmetry group is Oh, of order 48, the three dimensional hyperoctahedral group. This group's subgroups include D3d (order 12), the symmetry group of a triangular antiprism; D4h (order 16), the symmetry group of a square bipyramid; and Td (order 24), the symmetry group of a rectified tetrahedron. These symmetries can be emphasized by different colorings of the faces.\nNets.\nIt has eleven arrangements of nets.\nDual.\nThe octahedron is the dual polyhedron to the cube.\nFaceting.\nThe uniform tetrahemihexahedron is a tetrahedral symmetry faceting of the regular octahedron, sharing edge and vertex arrangement. It has four of the triangular faces, and 3 central squares."}

{"id": "85028", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85028", "title": "Origin of life", "text": "The origin of life on Earth is a scientific problem which is not yet solved. There are many ideas, but few clear facts.\nMost experts agree that all life today evolved by common descent from a single primitive lifeform. It is not known how this early life form evolved, but scientists think it was a natural process which happened about 3,900 million years ago. This is in accord with the philosophy of naturalism: only natural causes are admitted.\nIt is not known if metabolism came first or genetics. The main hypothesis which supports genetics first is the RNA world hypothesis, and the one which supports metabolism first is the protein world hypothesis.\nAnother big problem is how cells developed. Melvin Calvin, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, wrote a book on the subject, and so did Alexander Oparin. What links most of the early work on the origin of life is the idea that before life began there must have been a process of chemical change. Another question which has been discussed by J.D. Bernal and others is the origin of the cell membrane. By concentrating the chemicals in one place, the cell membrane performs a vital function.\nWhat we call life has only been verified in things that include RNA, mechanisms for encoding and decoding RNA, and mechanisms for building proteins from amino acids. The search for a verifiable theory of biogenesis is a separate field of research.\nFossil record.\nEarliest claimed life on Earth.\nThe earliest claimed lifeforms are fossilized microorganisms (or microfossils). They were found in iron and silica-rich rocks which were once hydrothermal vents in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt of Quebec, Canada.\nThese rocks are as old as 4.28 billion years. The tubular forms they contain are shown in a report. If this is the oldest record of life on Earth, it suggests \"an almost instantaneous emergence of life\" after oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago. According to Stephen Blair Hedges, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth\u2026 then it could be common in the universe\".\nPrevious earliest.\nA scientific study from 2002 showed that geological formations of stromatolites 3.45 billion years old contain fossilized cyanobacteria. At the time it was widely agreed that stromatolites were the oldest known lifeforms on Earth which had left a record of its existence. Therefore, if life originated on Earth, this happened sometime between 4.4 billion years ago, when water vapor first liquefied, and 3.5 billion years ago. This is the background to the latest discovery discussed above.\nThe earliest evidence of life comes from the Isua supercrustal belt in Western Greenland, and from similar formations in the nearby Akilia Islands. This is because a high level of the lighter isotope of carbon is found there. Living things take up lighter isotopes because this takes less energy. Carbon entering into rock formations has a concentration of elemental \u03b413C of about \u22125.5. of 12C, biomass has a \u03b413C of between \u221220 and \u221230. These isotopic fingerprints are preserved in the rocks. With this evidence, Mojzis suggested that life existed on the planet already by 3.85 billion years ago.\nA few scientists think life might have been carried from planet to planet by the transport of spores. This idea, now known as panspermia, was first put forward by Arrhenius.\nHistory of studies into the origin of life.\nSpontaneous generation.\nUntil the early 19th century many people believed in the regular spontaneous generation of life from non-living matter. This was called spontaneous generation, and was disproved by Louis Pasteur. He showed that without spores no bacteria or viruses grew on sterile material.\nDarwin.\nIn a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker on 11 February 1871, Charles Darwin proposed a \"natural process\" for the origin of life.\nHe suggested that the original spark of life may have begun in a \"warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. A protein compound was then chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes\". He went on to explain that \"at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed\".\nHaldane and Oparin.\nNo real progress was made until 1924 when Alexander Oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevented the synthesis of the organic molecules. Organic molecules are the necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his \"The Origin of Life\", Oparin argued that a \"primordial soup\" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygen-less atmosphere through the action of sunlight. These would combine in ever-more complex fashions until they formed droplets. These droplets would \"grow\" by fusion with other droplets, and \"reproduce\" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive metabolism in which those factors which promote \"cell integrity\" survive, those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.\nAround the same time J.B.S. Haldane also suggested that the Earth's pre-biotic oceans, which were very different from what oceans are now, would have formed a \"hot dilute soup\". In this soup, organic compounds, the building blocks of life, could have formed. This idea was called \"biopoiesis\", the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but nonliving molecules.\nEarly conditions on Earth.\nThere is almost no geological record from before 3.8 billion years ago. The environment that existed in the Hadean era was hostile to life, but how much so is not known. There was a time, between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years ago, which is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment. It is so named because many lunar craters are thought to have formed then. The situation on other planets, such as Earth, Venus, Mercury and Mars must have been similar. These impacts would likely sterilize the Earth (kill all life), if it existed at that time.\nSeveral people have suggested that the chemicals in the cell give clues as to what the early seas must have been like. In 1926, Macallum noted that the inorganic composition of the cell cytosol dramatically differs from that of modern sea water: \"the cell\u2026 has endowments transmitted from a past almost as remote as the origin of life on earth\". For example: \"All cells contain much more potassium, phosphate, and transition metals than modern ... oceans, lakes, or rivers\". \"Under the anoxic, CO2-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of inland basins at geothermal fields would [be like the chemistry inside] modern cells\".\nTemperature.\nIf life evolved in the deep ocean, near a hydrothermal vent, it could have originated as early as 4 to 4.2 billion years ago. If, on the other hand, life originated at the surface of the planet, a common opinion is it could only have done so between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago.\nLazcano and Miller (1994) suggest that the pace of molecular evolution was dictated by the rate of recirculating water through mid-ocean submarine vents. Complete recirculation takes 10 million years, so any organic compounds produced by then would be altered or destroyed by temperatures exceeding 300\u00a0\u00b0C. They estimate that the development of a 100 kilobase genome of a DNA/protein primitive heterotroph into a 7000 gene filamentous cyanobacterium would have required only 7 million years.\nHistory of Earth's atmosphere.\nOriginally, the Earth's atmosphere had almost no free oxygen. It gradually changed to what it is today, over a very long time (see Great Oxygenation Event). The process began with cyanobacteria. They were the first organisms to make free oxygen by photosynthesis. Most organisms today need oxygen for their metabolism; only a few can use other sources for respiration.\nSo it is expected that the first proto-organisms were chemoautotrophs, and did not use aerobic respiration. They were anaerobic.\nCurrent models.\nThere is no \"standard model\" on how life started. Most accepted models are built on molecular biology and cell biology:\nThe origin of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic chemicals from which life is thought to have formed are:\nMolecular oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3) were either rare or absent.\nThree stages.\nBernal suggested that evolution may have commenced early, some time between Stage 1 and 2.\nOrigin of organic molecules.\nThere are three sources of organic molecules on the early Earth: \nEstimates of these sources suggest that the heavy bombardment before 3.5 billion years ago made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by other energy sources.\nMiller's experiment and the primordial soup.\nIn 1953 a graduate student, Stanley Miller, and his professor, Harold Urey, performed an experiment that showed how organic molecules could have formed on early Earth from inorganic precursors.\nThe now-famous Miller\u2013Urey experiment used a highly reduced mixture of gases \u2013 methane, ammonia and hydrogen \u2013 to form basic organic monomers, such as amino acids. We do know now that for more than the first half of the Earth's history its atmosphere had almost no oxygen.\nFox's experiments.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Sidney W. Fox studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures under conditions that might have existed early in Earth's history. He demonstrated that amino acids could by itself form small peptides. These amino acids and small peptides could be encouraged to form closed spherical membranes, called microspheres.\nSpecial conditions.\nSome scientists have suggested special conditions which could make cell synthesis easier.\nClay world.\nA clay model for the origin of life was suggested by A. Graham Cairns-Smith. Clay theory suggests complex organic molecules arose gradually on a pre-existing non-organic platform, namely, silicate crystals in solution.\nDeep-hot biosphere model.\nIn the 1970s, Thomas Gold proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometers below the surface. The discovery in the late 1990s of nanobes (filamental structures that are smaller than bacteria, but that may contain DNA in deep rocks) might support Gold's theory.\nIt is now reasonably well established that microbial life is plentiful at shallow depths in the Earth (up to five kilometers below the surface) in the form of extremophile archaea, rather than the better-known eubacteria (which live in more accessible conditions).\nGold asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory was that the flow of food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle.\nSelf-organization and replication.\nSelf-organization and self-replication are the hallmark of living systems. Non-living molecules sometimes show those features under proper conditions. For example, Martin and Russel showed that cell membranes separating contents from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things. They argue that inorganic matter like that would be life's most likely last common ancestor.\nTheories.\nRNA world hypothesis.\nIn this hypothesis, RNA is said to work both as an enzyme and as a container of genes. Later, DNA took over its genetic role.\nThe RNA world hypothesis proposes that life based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) pre-dates the current world of life based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), RNA and proteins. RNA is able both to store genetic information, like DNA, and to catalyze chemical reactions, like an enzyme. It may have supported pre-cellular life and been a major step towards cellular life.\nThere are some pieces of evidence which support this idea:\nMetabolism and proteins.\nThis idea suggests that proteins worked as enzymes first, producing metabolism. After that DNA and RNA began to work as containers of genes.\nThis idea also has some evidences which supports this.\nLipids.\nIn this scheme membranes made of lipid bilayers occur early on. Once organic chemicals are enclosed, more complex biochemistry is then possible.\nPanspermia.\nThis is the idea suggested by Arrhenius, and developed by Fred Hoyle, that life developed elsewhere in the universe and arrived on Earth in the form of spores. This is not a theory of how life began, but a theory of how it might have spread. It may have spread, for example, by meteorites.\nSome propose that early Mars was a better place to start life than was the early Earth. The molecules which combined to form genetic material are more complex than the \"primordial soup\" of organic (carbon-based) chemicals that existed on Earth four billion years ago. If RNA was the first genetic material, then minerals containing boron and molybdenum could assist in its formation. These minerals were much more common on Mars than on Earth.\nIn Religion.\nIn Christianity, some people reject the idea of evolution. They believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old. This is known as Young Earth Creationism. However, the Bible does not explicitly state the age of the Earth, only that 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.' (Genesis 1:1) \nGod is portrayed as the creator of all things, and the originator of life on Earth (Genesis 1 &amp; 2)."}

Fabian was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season. \nStorm History.\nFabian developed from a tropical wave in the tropical Atlantic Ocean on August 25. It moved west-northwestward under the influence of the subtropical ridge to its north, and steadily strengthened in an area of warm water temperatures and light wind shear. The hurricane attained a peak intensity of 145\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) on September 1, and it slowly weakened as it turned northward. On September 5, Fabian made a direct hit on the island of Bermuda with wind speeds of over 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h). After passing the island, the hurricane turned to the northeast, and became extratropical on September 8.\nImpact, aftermath and records.\nFabian was the strongest hurricane to hit Bermuda since Hurricane Arlene in 1963. It was both the most damaging and the first hurricane to cause a death on the island since 1926. The hurricane's powerful winds resulted in moderate damage and destroyed roofs throughout the island. A strong storm surge associated with the hurricane killed four people crossing a causeway on Bermuda, temporarily closing the only link between two islands. The endangered Bermuda Petrel, better known as the Cahow, was threatened by the hurricane, which destroyed ten nests, although volunteer work transported the species to a safer location. Strong swells resulted in damage in northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and also caused four people to drown along the United States' Atlantic coast. In all, Fabian caused around $300\u00a0million (2003\u00a0USD, $357 million in damage and eight deaths.\nRetirement.\nBecause the devastating affects in Bermuda the name Fabian was retired.

While most of the Beatles's records were made in Studio Two, it was being used for another project, so much of \"Revolver\" was made in Studio Three, which was much smaller and meant for use by soloists. Space was cramped, and the sound of the record was different from their earlier ones.\nThe album also got a different from earlier Beatles albums. The band felt free to \"branch out\" into new themes and ideas, that nobody had tried in a pop music recording before. \"Taxman\" commented on the tax system in England. \"Eleanor Rigby\" was about . \"Yellow Submarine\" became a hit with children. \"Good Day Sunshine\" and \"Got to Get You Into My Life\" were covered by other bands.\nA few of the songs made references to drugs, particularly John Lennon's songs. \"She Said She Said\" was about a party in Los Angeles the Beatles had gone to, and had taken LSD. \"Doctor Robert\" was about a New York doctor (Charles Roberts) who sedatives and \"feel-good\" drugs for his patients. \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" came from Lennon's reading \"The Psychedelic Experience\", which adapted the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" as a drug-user's guide.\nBeatles lead guitarist George Harrison was pleased to have three of his own songs included on \"Revolver\", \"Taxman\", \"Love You To\", and \"I Want to Tell You\". Most Beatles albums only had one or two Harrison songs. \"Love You To\" did not feature guitars, but Harrison instead played a sitar. World-famous sitarist Ravi Shankar heard the song, but did not like it, and offered to teach Harrison to play sitar properly. Shankar and Harrison went on to become lifelong friends.\nThree songs from the album were \"borrowed\" by Capitol Records in the United States, and used on a compilation album, \"Yesterday... and Today\", which came out before \"Revolver\". The songs were \"I'm Only Sleeping\", \"Doctor Robert\", and \"And Your Bird Can Sing\". Capitol Records then released \"Revolver\" in a shortened version. The compact disc edition for sale today follows the original British version.\n\"Revolver\" came out while the Beatles were on a concert tour. Bands normally perform songs from their latest album as a part of a concert. Strangely, the Beatles did not perform any \"Revolver\" songs on tour, but instead played the same music as on earlier tours. This got them criticism from some listeners. The tour also turned out to be the band's last. They played their final public concert in San Francisco, California on August 29, 1966."}

Although he was blind from an early age, he became one of the most important Spanish composers of the 20th century. He wrote a lot of music for guitar, which helped classical guitar music worldwide to become more popular. His most famous work is a guitar concerto called \"Concierto de Aranjuez\".\nLife.\nEarly life.\nRodrigo became blind at the age of three after becoming ill with diphtheria. When he was eight he began to learn piano and violin. He also learned the guitar, but never became very good at it, although he was to compose some wonderful music for the instrument.\nAfter studying music in Valencia he went to Paris where he studied with Paul Dukas in Paris. After a short time back in Spain he returned to Paris to study musicology, first under Maurice Emmanuel and then under Andr\u00e9 Pirro. In 1947 Rodrigo became a professor of music history in Madrid, a job that was made especially for him.\nHis famous concertos.\nRodrigo\u2019s most famous work, \"de Aranjuez\", was composed in 1939 in Paris. It is a concerto for solo classical guitar and orchestra. There are three movements. The middle movement is a slow movement with a tune which is played on the cor anglais. It has become one of classical music\u2019s best-loved tunes.\nAfter the success of this piece several other musicians asked him to write concertos for them, e.g. the flautist James Galway, the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and the guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia, for whom he composed \"Fantas\u00eda para un gentilhombre\" in 1954. Another of his works is called \"Concierto Andaluz,\" for four guitars and orchestra.\nHonours.\nIn 1991, Rodrigo was raised to the nobility by King Juan Carlos; he was given the title \"Marqu\u00e9s de los Jardines de Aranjuez\" (Marquis of the Gardens of Aranjuez). He was given the Prince of Asturias Award in 1996, the highest honour a Spanish civilian can get. He was made Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government in 1998.\nPersonal life.\nHe married Victoria Kamhi, a Turkish-born pianist, in 1933. They had a daughter called Cecilia. Rodrigo died in 1999 in Madrid at the age of 97. Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo and his wife Victoria are buried at the cemetery at Aranjuez.\nHis music.\nRodrigo composed about 170 works. These include 11 concertos, lots of pieces for choir, songs, piano music and guitar music. Like Manuel de Falla in the early 20th century, Rodrigo became the leading figure in Spanish music in the later part of the century. His music is not like most of the music that was being written in Europe at the time. At first his music was influenced by that of Stravinsky, Ravel and Granados, but later his personality gave it a special Spanish character. He had a lot of knowledge and wrote articles about lots of different arts subjects."}

The first book of the third series \"Warriors: The Power of Three\", \"The Sight\", was released on April 24, 2007. The fourth series, \"Warriors: Omen of the Stars\", began with \"The Fourth Apprentice\" on November 24, 2009\".\" The fifth series, \"Warriors: Dawn of the Clans\" began with \"The Sun Trail\" on March 5, 2013. The sixth series, \"Warriors: A Vision of Shadows\" began with \"The Apprentice's Quest\" on March 25, 2016. The current series, \"Warriors: The Broken Code\" began on April 9, 2019 with \"Lost Stars\". An eighth arc has been announced.\nSeven field guides were also released. They give more information about the Clans (the groups of cats) that are not mentioned in the series. Thirteen \"super edition\" books have been released, with another announced to be released soon. These books are about double the length of the normal books. Fifteen \"manga\" books have been released. These are graphic novels that tell short stories not seen in the main books.\nThe series focuses on a group of cats called ThunderClan and their lives around four other groups. Each mini-series focuses on different characters.\nSetting and characters.\nThe original series and the first two books of \"Warriors: The New Prophecy\" are set in a forest that the authors have said was based on the New Forest area of England. \nThe first six books center around Rusty, a kittypet (housecat) who joins ThunderClan, and finds out that there is a prophecy about him. The second series finds the forest in turmoil. \"Twolegs\" (humans) are destroying the forest, and a cat from each of the four Clans must go on a journey. Then, all the cats must find a new home. This involves mostly Leafpool and Squirrelflight, daughters of Rusty, now called Firestar. The third series, The Power of Three, involves Squirrelflight's \"kits\", Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze, and the special powers that they have. The next series, Omen of the Stars, involves Dovewing and Ivypool. Dovewing has a special power, and Ivypool doesn't, but she trains in the \"Dark Forest,\" their version of Hell, to try and be a better warrior than Dovewing. They must save all of the Clans, along with the three cats from The Power of Three. The next series, Dawn of the Clans, focuses on the creation of the Clans. A Vision of Shadows, the next series, focuses on Alderheart, who is Squirrelflight's son, along with Twigbranch and Violetshine, who are kits from SkyClan that were separated from their Clan at birth. They must find SkyClan and help them settle by the lake with the other Clans. This plan is complicated by Darktail, a very powerful and charismatic cat who has come to destroy all of the Clans. The Broken Code is the next series, which focuses on Shadowsight, Bristlefrost, and Rootspring. ThunderClan's leader has been replaced by an impostor, and StarClan is silent. It is their duty to save both Bramblestar and StarClan.\n\"Warriors\" book list.\n\"Warriors: The Prophecies Begin\".\nThis mini-series focuses on the young kitten Rusty. In the first book, \"Into the Wild\", he discovers a kitten named Graypaw in the woods. After a cat named Bluestar asks him to join ThunderClan, Rusty decides to leave his home in the town and join Bluestar's Clan - who she turns out to lead. There, he is given the name Firepaw. Some of his friends include Graypaw, Sandpaw, Dustpaw, and Ravenpaw - they become Graystripe, Sandstorm, and Dustpelt, but Ravenpaw is chased off due to his mentor's evil intentions. Firepaw himself is later named a warrior, Fireheart.\nFireheart finds out that a fellow warrior, Tigerclaw, has killed a cat in ThunderClan because he wanted to take this cat's position. Fireheart reveals this to his Clan in \"Forest of Secrets\". Tigerclaw is then forced away from ThunderClan and lives as a lone cat in the forest. However, he is always watching for a chance to take revenge on Fireheart.\nHowever, Tigerclaw then becomes leader of a rival clan, ShadowClan. He tries to get the four Clans to join and form one single Clan called TigerClan. When they refuse, he asks a group of city cats called BloodClan to fight the other Clans. However, this plan fails and Tigerclaw is killed by the leader of BloodClan.\nThe books in the original \"Warriors\" series are:\n\"Warriors: The New Prophecy\".\nThe next mini-series focuses on three cats: Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, and Leafpaw of ThunderClan. One night, in a dream, Brambleclaw speaks to the old ThunderClan leader, Bluestar, who tells him to meet with three other cats and to listen to what midnight tells them. He meets Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Crowpaw of WindClan, and together with their friends Stormfur and Squirrelpaw, they travel to the \"sun-drown-place\" (the ocean). There they learn that twolegs (humans) will destroy the forest because they want to build more thunderpaths (roads).\nThe six cats hurry back, but on the way, they meet some cats in the mountains known as the Tribe of Rushing Water. The tribe is being hunted by a large mountain cat, named Sharptooth. (mountain lion) . They think that Stormfur is the cat that is foretold to save them. In the end, it is Feathertail, Stormfur's sister, who kills the mountain cat, but she dies doing this. After leaving the tribe, the five remaining cats go home but find that the clans are worse than they had thought. The cats are all starving because the humans are scaring away all the prey and destroying the land. Firestar finally manages to convince the other clan leaders, (Leopardstar of RiverClan, Blackstar of ShadowClan, and Tallstar of WindClan, though he was willing) to come with him, and the four clans travel to a new territory by a lake.\nBut even though the cats are now safe, the trouble is not over. Squirrelpaw, given her warrior name Squirrelflight, does not trust Brambleclaw because he is friends with his half-brother Hawkfrost, son of Tigerstar and a rogue called Sasha. Leafpaw, now known as Leafpool, falls in love with Crowpaw, now known as Crowfeather. As the cats fight and fall in love, lots of badgers attack ThunderClan, making Leafpool make the choice to give up Crowfeather. It also results in Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight realizing how much they mean to each other. In \"Sunset,\" Hawkfrost wants to kill Firestar so that Brambleclaw can become leader. Brambleclaw realizes that he is more loyal to Firestar than to his half-brother, and he kills Hawkfrost to save his leader.\n\"Warriors: Power of Three\".\nThis series is about three cats - Jaypaw, Hollypaw, and Lionpaw. They are the kits Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw and they are also grandchildren of Firestar.\nThese three kittens are about to be ThunderClan apprentices. Hollypaw wants to be a medicine cat, and Jaypaw and Lionpaw will train to be warriors. However, Jaypaw is blind, and training to be a warrior will be hard for him. Eventually Hollypaw and Jaypaw switch roles after StarClan, the warrior ancestors, tell Jaypaw he needs to become a medicine cat. A few moons later, Lionpaw begins secretly meeting a WindClan apprentice, Heatherpaw while being trained by Tigerstar. Heatherpaw finds a set of secret tunnels under the ground and she and Lionpaw meet in them. Hollypaw finds out about this, and she and her friend Cinderpaw try to stop him from going to the tunnels. He eventually realizes that it is wrong to meet a cat from another clan, and breaks off the friendship. Then, three WindClan kittens get lost in the tunnels and Heatherpaw, Lionpaw, Hollypaw, Jaypaw, and Breezepaw have to save them.\nIn \"Outcast\", the Tribe of Rushing Water is in danger from another band of cats in the mountains. Firestar sends the original New Prophecy cats, plus some extras, to the mountains to try to help them. Jaypaw meets the Tribe of Endless Hunting, the tribe\u2019s ancestors, and realizes that the tribe is not all that different. In Eclipse, WindClan is not happy about ThunderClan taking in non-clan cats, so all four clans battle (Thunder and Shadow vs Wind and River), and the fighting is only stopped by an eclipse. A strange cat named Sol had predicted it, and Jaypaw thinks Sol is very powerful. After the battle, Hollypaw and Lionpaw get their warrior names, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze.\nSol tries to become powerful within the clans by convincing ShadowClan to stop believing in the Warrior Code. Jaypaw, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze fake a sign from StarClan with Tawnypelt's kits to help to make Blackstar believe in his warrior ancestors again. Sol is driven out, and Jaypaw, after saving ThunderClan from a greencough, is given his medicine cat name, Jayfeather. When the clan is in the camp, a fire starts, and the three are trapped on a cliff. Squirrelflight tries to save them, but a warrior called Ashfur blocks the way. It turns out he was mad that Squirrelflight chose Brambleclaw to be her mate, and not him. In order to save the three, Squirrelflight has to tell Ashfur an important secret - Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf are not her kittens. Ashfur wants to tell all the clans, so right before the gathering, he is found dead in a river. The cats think Sol did it, so some of them go on a trip to a Twolegplace (a human town), find him, and take him back to ThunderClan. Meanwhile, Jayfeather is trying to find out who his mother is. After finding some clues, he realizes that she is Leafpool, and his father is Crowfeather. Hollyleaf is very mad upon hearing this, and she herself tells the cats at the gathering about it. She also tells her brothers that she killed Ashfur to protect them. Then, to escape what she did, she runs into one of the tunnels. It collapses, and though her body isn't found, it is assumed that she is dead.\n\"Warriors: Omen of the Stars\".\nThe fourth arc follows prophesied cats Jayfeather and Lionblaze as well as a new addition, Dovewing, as they work with Dovewing's sister, Ivypool, to defeat the Dark Forest. The Dark Forest is home to the souls of cats who were evil in life and broke the Warrior Code. \n\"Warriors: Dawn of the Clans\".\nThe fifth arc details how the five warrior Clans came to be.\n\"Warriors: A Vision Of Shadows\".\nThe sixth arc follows Alderheart and Twigbranch of ThunderClan and Violetshine of ShadowClan as they attempt to bring SkyClan, the lost Clan, back to the lake home of the other Clans.\n\"Warriors: The Broken Code\".\nThe seventh arc follows Bristlefrost of ThunderClan, Shadowsight of ShadowClan, and Rootspring of SkyClan as they try to purge an impostor from their leader, Bramblestar's, body.

It was the first binary asteroid to be found and is a member of the Koronis family of asteroids.\nDiscovery and name.\nIda was found by Johann Palisa on September 29, 1884 in Vienna. It is named after Ida, a Cretan nymph in Greek mythology who lived on a mountain that has her name (see Mount Ida, Crete).\nMoon.\nIda has a small moon, Dactyl, which was found on February 17, 1994 by \"Galileo\" mission member Ann Harch, while examining the delayed image downloads. The moon was given the designation S/1993 (243) 1 and later named (243) Ida I Dactyl. The pictures where it was first seen were taken on 28 August 1993, hence the designation. The moon was reported on 12 March 1994.\nDactyl is only 1.4\u00a0km in diameter. Some researchers believe that Dactyl formed from debris blown off from Ida because of cratering, while others suggest that Ida and Dactyl formed as a pair a billion or more years ago when Ida's parent body was disrupted. Both of these theories present difficulties that are unresolved at this time. Since Dactyl was found, other sightings have suggested that asteroid moons are common.\nAlthough Ida's dimensions, measured along the principal axes (based on its rotation) are 53.6\u00d724.0\u00d715.2\u00a0km, the best-fit ellipsoid measures 60.0\u00d725.2\u00d718.6\u00a0km. Since its mass is well known thanks to its little moon, one can calculate that its surface gravity can be between 0.0031 and 0.0324\u00a0m/s\u00b2. The rotation axis is within one degree of the shorter dimension axis, which means the centrifugal effect can reach a value as high as 0.0042\u00a0m/s\u00b2 \u2014 at the tips of its longest axes, Ida is actually under tension."}

It has a fairly elliptical orbit that takes more than four years to circle the Sun. This asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation, taking 17.4\u00a0days to complete a 360\u00b0 revolution about its axis. It is a primitive C-type asteroid, which means the surface has lots of carbon; giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it.\nThis asteroid was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433 Eros. The spacecraft took pictures of one side of the asteroid, finding many big craters that have gouged out depressions in the surface. It is currently the biggest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft, and the first C-type asteroid to be so explored.\nDescription.\n253 Mathilde is very dark. The asteroid has a number of very big craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two biggest craters, Ishikari (29.3\u00a0km) and Karoo (33.4\u00a0km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have blown big volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters.\nThe density measured by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300\u00a0kg/m\u00b3, is less than half that of a normal carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile (an asteroid that has been broken apart by a collision and pulled back together by gravity). The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the volume inside of 253 Mathilde has open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some big internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.\nMathilde's orbit is eccentric, taking it to the farther reaches of the Main belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does not cross the planetary orbits. It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroids \u2014 most asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 2 \u2013 24 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to take pictures of 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may been accounted for by a moon orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none bigger than 10\u00a0km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of 253 Mathilde."}

Mike Scully said that Flanders is \"everything Homer would love to be, although he'll never admit it.\" Flanders had originally been meant to just be a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but Harry Shearer used \"such a sweet voice\" and Flanders was planned to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would choose to live next to over Homer.\nHow he was received.\nNed's \"unbearable niceness\" has been described as \"\"The Simpsons\"' worst comment about religion.

They also exist in other countries, such as Canada. However, the term is most often used in the United States. These groups have a strong support of conservative social and political ideas. Usually, this comes from a belief that the United States was founded on a strong belief in God. It also come from a belief that American laws and policies should be based on what is in the Bible. Members of the Christian right can be from any branch of Christianity, including Catholicism. However, the religious right is most often used with Evangelical Christians, Fundamentalists (such as Born-agains) and Mormons. About 15% of Americans say they are part of the Christian or religious right.\nPeople who have been conservative due to their religion have been in the United States for hundreds of years. For example, the people who put John Scopes on trial would later be called members of the religious right. However, the term first came into use in the 1970s. Jerry Falwell was one of the first people to use it. He and others felt that the country and its institutions (such as schools and colleges) were run by left-wing intellectuals who did not believe in God. They thought that in reality most people believed in God and did not care for left-wing intellectuals. The fight between left-wing intellectuals and the religious right is often called the \"culture wars\".\nPresidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Donald Trump were elected in part due to support from the religious right.\nAs well as the Christian right, there is something called the Christian left. However, it is not as well-known or powerful.\nIssues.\nHere are some issues that the Christian right feels strongly about:\nAbortion.\nThe Christian right became more popular again in the 1970s under Falwell due to abortion. This was in response to the \"Roe v. Wade\" decision made by the U.S. Supreme Court. Most members of the Christian right feel that life begins at conception. They think that killing a fetus is murder. Therefore, they think abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. This is called being \"pro-life\". Though the right has not been able to get rid of \"Roe\" (and it is now considered to be a precedent by most judges), they have been successful in making it harder to get abortions in some states.\nSexuality.\nMany members of the Christian right believe that the Bible says it is bad to be homosexual (gay or lesbian). They used to support sodomy laws. Today, they are mostly against allowing gay marriage. They have had many laws and initiatives passed to stop gay people from marrying (such as California's Proposition 8). Some of these were found to be unconstitutional in the courts. To make stopping gay marriage constitutional, many have pushed for an amendment to the United States constitution to ban gay marriage.\nEvolution.\nMany members of the Christian right do not believe in evolution, because it goes against the creation story of the Bible. They instead favor creationism or intelligent design. Most biologists believe that evolution is true and that arguments against evolution are weak. In a few places, they have been successful in teaching intelligent design alongside evolution in public schools.\nPrayer in schools.\nMany members of the Christian right want to allow prayer in public schools and display of things related to Christ in public or government places. As with gay marriage, this has been questioned in the courts, usually due to the freedom of religion clause in the First Amendment."}

The cathedral is in Canterbury, Kent. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also one of the greatest examples of mediaeval Norman architecture in Britain. The cathedral is the 'seat' of the archbishop of Canterbury. The archbishop is the most important bishop in the Church of England.\nHistory.\nThe church was founded by Augustine of Canterbury in 597 AD. The present version was built on the remains of the old Saxon church by Lanfranc, starting in 1066. Lanfranc, the first Norman Archbishop, was put in position by William the Conqueror. His cathedral was dedicated in 1077. The architecture of the present cathedral is basically Romanesque, with many later repairs and additions. The nave (where the congregation sits) was rebuilt in the 14th century with newly discovered building methods. The new style of English Gothic architecture ('perpendicular') gave the building greater height and larger windows. Some of the stained glass in the cathedral is from the 12th century. It was probably made between 1130 and 1160. There was a great fire in 1174 and the people built most of the cathedral again. The fire did not destroy some of the old windows from the 12th century.\nThe cathedral area, called the precinct, has walls all around it. Canterbury also has defensive wall. Much of this wall is still standing. The cathedral precinct includes many other buildings: a school, a conference building, a number of houses and a palace. The Deanery is where the dean of Canterbury lives: he is the manager of the cathedral. The dean and chapter (a committee) take the decisions. The archbishop's job is to run the whole Anglican Church.\nThe cathedral costs \u00a312,000 a day to run and repair, and there are no government grants. Because of this, fund-raising is one of the Dean's main jobs. The cathedral is a working church. On Sundays there are six services (of different kinds). On weekdays there are three services. These are free of any entry charge. Tourists visiting pay a fee to see the cathedral when there is no service.\nIt was where Thomas Becket was murdered by knights of Henry II, after the king asked, supposedly, \"Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?\" Beckett was the second archbishop of Canterbury to be murdered. The first was Alphege in 1012. The third was Thomas Cranmer, in 1533.\nin 1988, UNESCO and the World Heritage Committee named Canterbury Cathedral, the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey, and St Martin's Church together as a World Heritage Site. As a group, they are buildings which show the development of Christianity in Britain."}

Trans fat is often produced in higher amounts in factories when manufacturing certain processed foods such as margarine. Trans fat occurs in nature only very rarely, found in small amounts in meat and milk fat. When vegetable oils are heated or when they are \"hydrogenated\", trans fats are made. Hydrogenation is the process of bubbling hydrogen gas through the oil to change its consistency. The bubbling raises the melting point of the oil. As the hydrogen passes through, the oil begins to become solid. By stopping the hydrogenation part of the way through, manufacturers obtain \"partially hydrogenated oil\". This is similar to butter, but much cheaper to produce. It is sold as \"margarine\", \"oleo\" or \"vegetable shortening\". The process allows cheaply adding a butter-like consistency to food products.\nTrans fat is bad for human health and has been linked to a number of problems including: coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, liver dysfunction, and infertility. Healthy oils are always liquid at the temperature of blood. Saturated and trans fats are not.\nThere has yet to be a study which shows that trans fat is good for human health in any way. Since scientists and nutritionists now know the health issues related to eating trans fats, trans fats are being used less but there are still some in commercial food products.\nFor some time, the US government's \"Food and Drug Administration\" allowed makers of food products to label their products as having \"0 grams of trans fat per serving\" as long as the amount of trans fat in the food product falls below 0.5\u00a0grams per serving. Since partially hydrogenated oils are the major source of trans fat, reading the \"ingredients\" label is the safest way to ensure that a food does not contain any trans fat at all. Fried foods will likely, but not necessarily, contain trans fat since fried foods are produced by using very hot oil. \n2015\u20132018 phaseout in the United States.\nIn 2013, the Food and Drug Administration began to gradually stop the use of trans fats in all foods. It says there is no safe amount of trans fats that should be in food eaten by humans.\nIn June 2015, the FDA issued a final statement. It says there is no agreement by scientists that artificial trans fatty acids are safe for any use in human food. Trans fat must be taken out of all food production within three years (by June 2018).

The part of the OLED that creates light is made of a very thin layer of organic compounds. The main use of OLED technology is for flat panel displays for smartphones and other mobile devices where they are in some ways better than LCDs. OLEDs can be used to make displays that can bend. These can be used in many different ways. For example, they can be used in clothing.\nOLED provides high contrast of screen. It is characterized by low energy consumption (due to the absence of additional illumination).\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nLCDs are in some ways better than OLEDs and some ways worse. OLEDs can make more colors and levels of brightness than LEDs. Unlike LCDs their colors do not change when viewed at an angle. They are also much cheaper to make. OLEDs make light, so they do not need a light shining through from the back as LCDs do. This also makes black parts of the screen able to be fully turned \"off\" making them darker. LCDs also need to use filters to work properly. These filters block much of the light created by the LED/CCFL. Because of backlighting and filtering, OLEDs use far less power than LCDs for the amount of light made. OLEDs also react faster to changes in electricity. They turn on and off much faster than LCDs.\nLEDs will last longer than OLEDs. This is the biggest problem with OLEDs. Currently most OLEDs used in displays will work for about 5,000 hours of use. LEDs normally work for 60,000 hours. This may change as experiments in 2007 created a type of OLED that worked for 198,000 hours. The organic compounds that make up OLEDs are also more easily damaged by water. \nOLED technology is currently patented by the Eastman Kodak company and several other companies. Because of this, a company must pay to be allowed to use it in their product.\nHow they work.\nThere are several parts to an OLED:\nThe emissive and conductive layers are made of special organic molecules that conduct electricity. The anode and cathode connect the OLED to the source of electricity.\nWhen electricity is applied to an OLED, the emissive layer becomes negatively charged and the conductive layer becomes positively charged. Electrostatic forces cause electrons to move from the positive conductive layer toward the negative emissive layer. This causes a change in the electrical levels and makes radiation that has a frequency in the range of visible light.\nOLED, as with all diodes, can only work if electricity flows through them in the correct direction. The Anode, connected to the emmisive layer must be at a higher electrical potential (more volts, more \"positive\") than the cathode, connected to the conductive layer, for the OLED to work."}

It is classified as a D-type asteroid and is probably made of organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates.\nThe orbit of Thule is unusual. It appears to orbit in the farthest edge of the Main belt in a 3:4 orbital resonance with planet Jupiter. Unlike the Hilda asteroids whose eccentricity is fairly common of main belt asteroids, Thule has a very low eccentricity - actually much lower than that of Jupiter itself and only a bit higher than that of Earth. Why it has this orbit is not clear, as is the reason for the absence of smaller bodies in similar 4:3 resonances with Jupiter.\nSome astronomers have argued that Thule's present orbit is the natural result of the force of Jupiter on a body orbiting at exactly the distance from the Sun Thule does, in the same way (though with the reverse effect) as the Kirkwood gaps in the more closer parts of the asteroid belt. It could thus be that the resonance which holds Thule in a very low-eccentricity orbit serves to eject other smaller bodies whose distance from the Sun is only a bit different from that of Thule itself.\nIt is the main member of the Thule dynamical group.\nIt was found by Johann Palisa on October 25, 1888 in Vienna and was named aptly after the ultimate northern land of Thule."}

Biden was also the 47th vice president from 2009 through 2017 during the Barack Obama presidency. He is a member of the Democratic Party and is from Wilmington, Delaware. Before becoming Vice President, Biden was a U.S. Senator from Delaware from 1973 to 2009. He had served in the Senate longer than any other President or Vice President.\nHe tried to become the Democratic candidate for President in 1988 and 2008 but did not win. During the 2008 election, then-Senator Barack Obama picked him to be his running mate. He is a Roman Catholic. Biden has received several awards. He has five honorary doctorates, including one from his alma mater and one from where he has taught law. He has also earned the \"Best of Congress Award\", an award from the Pakistani government, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction.\nAfter finishing his second term as vice president, Biden began working at the University of Pennsylvania. On April 25, 2019, Biden launched his presidential campaign for the 2020 election. On April 8, 2020, Biden became the presumptive nominee for the Democratic nomination after Bernie Sanders ended his campaign. On November 7, he defeated former President Donald Trump and became the president-elect of the United States. He became President on January 20, 2021, after he became inaugurated. He is the oldest person to become President and the first from Delaware.\nEarly life.\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942 at St. Mary's Keller Memorial Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania to a family of Irish Catholics. His father, Joe Sr., was a businessman. When he was young, his family moved to Wilmington, Delaware. He also began to stutter at an early age. In high school, Biden played football and baseball, but he was not a very good student. Biden attended college at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University. He did not have to fight in the Vietnam War because he was going to college and had asthma as a child.\nIn the Senate.\nFor many years, Biden was a U.S. Senator from Delaware. Biden was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 when he was 29 years old. His election was somewhat of a surprise. The other candidate, J. Caleb Boggs, had more experience and more money to spend on his campaign. He is one of the youngest people to become a U.S. Senator, because he was only two months older than the minimum age, 30, required to be one. (While he was 29 during the election, he turned 30 before he became a senator.)\nBiden was re-elected to the Senate six times. He became a prominent defender of Israel as a senator, and said that if there was no country like Israel the U.S. would have to make one. Later in his time in the Senate, Biden served as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Foreign Relations committee deals with American issues in other countries. When Biden was chair, the committee dealt with the 1991 Gulf War, the 2003 War in Iraq, and several treaties. The Judiciary Committee dealt with the choice of Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, and others for the Supreme Court (SCOTUS). Biden thought that Thomas and Bork should not be on the Court. Though U.S. senators work in Washington, DC, Biden took the train home to Delaware every night.\nRunning for President and Vice President.\nBiden ran for President three times, in 1988, 2008 and 2020. The first time he was viewed as a good choice early on, but quit after it was discovered he gave a speech that was copied from Neil Kinnock, a British politician.\nBiden tried again to get the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2008 presidential election. He ran mostly on foreign issues, especially getting U.S. troops out of Iraq. Many thought of him as a good choice for Secretary of State. He stopped his campaign on January 3, 2008 after he did not get many votes in the Iowa caucus. However, he later became Barack Obama's pick for Vice President due to what he knew about Iraq and because the working class liked him.\nWhen Biden was running for President, he criticized Obama, talking about his lack of experience, but later he supported Obama to become president. His opponent as Vice President was Sarah Palin, who had less experience but was seen as more interesting by the media. Before the election, there were debates between the different candidates running for president or vice president. In the debate between Biden and Palin, many people believed that he knew more about running America than Palin did. When Obama was elected President on November 4, 2008, Biden was elected Vice President.\nAs Vice President.\nBiden became Vice President on January 20, 2009, and is the first person from Delaware and first Roman Catholic to be Vice President. When Biden became Vice President, he said he would do things differently from Dick Cheney, who had been Vice President before him. Biden has said that his vice-presidency will not be like any other.\nBiden's main role was as an advisor to Obama, mostly on issues of foreign policy and the economy. Obama has asked for Biden's input on most of his major decisions, such as who to put in his Cabinet and how to fight the War in Afghanistan. Obama has put him in charge of groups to deal with the problems of the working class, as well as to watch the money in his stimulus bill. Biden had also traveled to the Middle East several times on behalf of Obama and the U.S. while Vice President. In 2011, Biden lead talks on the budget and the debt. On November 6, 2012, Biden was re-elected for a second term as Vice President along with President Barack Obama.\nIn August 2015, Biden said that he was looking for a possible chance of running for President again in the 2016 U.S. election. Biden formed a PAC for his possible run. On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and President Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to enter the race for the Democratic nomination for the presidency for the 2016 election.\nBiden never had to brake a tie vote in the United States Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president to do this.\nAfter winning the election, Biden served the Vice Presidency until January 20, 2017.\n2020 presidential election.\nDuring a tour of the U.S. Senate with reporters before leaving office on December 5, 2016, Biden said that a presidential bid was possible in the 2020 presidential election, after leaving office as Vice President. While on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on December 7, he stated \"never say never\" about running for President in 2020, while also admitting he did not see a scenario in which he would run for office again. On January 13, 2017, exactly one week before Donald Trump took office. he said he would not run. However, four days later, on January 17, he took the statement back, saying \"I'll run if I can walk.\"\nBiden was mentioned by many news outlets as a potential candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination. In March 2019, he said he may run.\nHe formally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019.\nIn April 2020, Biden became the only candidate in the primary making him the presumptive nominee for the nomination. At first, he lost the first three primary contests to Senator Bernie Sanders. After winning the South Carolina primary, he gained traction and won most of the Super Tuesday races.\nBiden promised when elected he would protect \"Roe v. Wade\" decision, create a public option for health insurance, decriminalization of recreational cannabis, pass the Equality Act, create free community college, and a $1.7 trillion climate plan supporting the Green New Deal. He supports regulation instead of a complete ban on fracking.\nIn early 2020, Biden promised he would pick a woman as his running mate. He also promised that his first Supreme Court appointment would be a black woman. In August 2020, he picked California U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.\nOn November 3, 2020, FiveThirtyEight's statistical model projected that Biden had a 89% chance to defeat Donald Trump. He defeated Trump in the general election after officially being projected as the winner on November 7, 2020. With more than 81 million votes, Biden received the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.\nPresident of the United States.\nTransition.\nBiden was elected the 46th President of the United States in November 2020, defeating the incumbent Donald Trump, the first sitting president to lose re-election since George H. W. Bush in 1992.\nHe became the second non-incumbent vice president to be elected president, and the first Democrat to do so. He is also expected to become the oldest president at the time of inauguration, as well as the first president from Delaware.\nAt first, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy did not want to acknowledge Biden as the winner of the 2020 election. On November 23, however, she formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.\nIn late December 2020, Biden received his first dose of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Delaware. He returned for his second dose in early January 2021.\nFirst 100 days.\nBiden was inaugurated shortly before noon on January 20, 2021 as the 46th president of the United States. At 78, he is the oldest person to become president. He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy) and the first president whose home state is Delaware.\nIn his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders, more than most recent presidents did in their first 100 days. Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had in their first month in office. His first actions were rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, rejoining the World Health Organization, a 100-day mandatory face mask requirements on federal property and acts to stop hunger in the United States. His presidency has been focused around his Build Back Better Plan agenda.\nOn February 4, 2021, he announced that the United States will stop giving weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for use in the Yemeni Civil War.\nOn March 11, 2021, the first anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus relief package. The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, support for small businesses and state and local governments, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden tried to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, but removed it from the stimulus package after criticism from both parties.\nIn March 2021, when there was an increase in migrants coming to the United States from Mexico, Biden told migrants: \"Don't come over.\" He said that the U.S. was arranging a plan for migrants to \"apply for asylum in place\", without leaving their original locations. In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations. Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children and told the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help take care of children separated at the border.\nOn March 23, 2021, all of his cabinet members were confirmed by the United States Senate. Biden is the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to have all of his original Cabinet secretary nominees confirmed to their posts. Two days later, Biden announced that he would run for re-election in the 2024 election.\nRest of 2021.\nOn April 22\u201323, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the US would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%\u201352% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels..\nOn April 28, 2021, Biden addressed the United States Congress in his State of the Union Address. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris as President of the Senate \u2015 the first time two women preside over an address to Congress.\nOn June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday. Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was declared a holiday in 1986.\nIn July 2021, when not many people were getting their COVID-19 vaccine and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccination\". He also criticized the increase of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, saying it was \"killing people\".\nBy early July 2021, most of the American troops in Afghanistan were leaving or had left. On August 15, during an offensive by the Taliban, the Afghan government collapsed. Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to help the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies. He has been criticized for the way he handled the withdrawal. He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\", since the \"Afghan military collapsed [against the Taliban], sometimes without trying to fight\".\nIn August 2021, the Biden administration pushed for an infrastructure bill that can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the United States by 45% by 2030. He would also support lowering taxes for people who invest in renewable energy and electric vehicles and would add a fee on methane emissions.\nAllegations of physical misconduct.\nThere have been many photographs of Biden hugging, kissing, and touching women and/or children in what commentators said to be inappropriate. Biden has said that the behavior had got him in trouble in the past.\nIn March 2019, former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores said that Biden kissed her without consent at a 2014 campaign rally in Las Vegas. Flores wrote that Biden walked up behind her, put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair, and kissed the back of her head. In an interview with \"HuffPost\", Flores stated she believed Biden's behavior should force him not to run in 2020. By early April 2019, a total of seven women had made such allegations regarding Biden.\nIn April 2019, former Biden staffer Tara Reade said that she had felt uncomfortable many times when Biden touched her on her shoulder and neck while working in his Senate office in 1993. In March 2020, Reade said Biden had pushed her against a wall and penetrated her while on Capitol Hill in 1993. Biden denied the allegations.\nPersonal life.\nWhile in college, he married his first wife, Nelia Hunter. They had three children: two sons (Beau and Robert) and a daughter (Naomi). After college, he became a lawyer and served on a County Council, a group of people who run a county. In 1972, Biden's family got into a car accident. Nelia and Naomi were killed, and Beau and Robert were hurt very badly. Both survived the accident. Beau was the Attorney General in Delaware until January 2015 and served as a soldier in Iraq. Beau died from brain cancer on May 30, 2015 in Bethesda, Maryland at the age of 46. Biden thought of resigning as Vice President because of his son's death.\nBiden married his second wife, Jill Tracy Jacobs Biden, in 1977. She is a teacher and the former Second Lady of the United States. In 1981, they had a daughter, Ashley, who is now a social worker. In 1988, Biden suffered from bleeding in his brain and needed brain surgery twice. Because of what he saw in his family and neighborhood, Biden does not drink alcohol.\nIn February 1988, Biden had surgery to help heal a brain aneurysm. While recuperating, he had a pulmonary embolism and recovered a few months later.\nIn November 2020, while playing with his two dogs Champ and Major, he suffered a stress fracture in his foot and was hospitalized.\nBiden lives just outside of Wilmington, Delaware and often goes there on the weekends since becoming president.\nAwards and honors.\nBiden has received honorary degrees from \nthe University of Scranton (1976),\nSaint Joseph's University (1981),\nWidener University School of Law (2000),\nEmerson College (2003),\nhis alma mater the University of Delaware (2004),\nSuffolk University Law School (2005), and his other alma mater Syracuse University (2009).\nBiden got the Chancellor Medal from his alma mater, Syracuse University, in 1980. In 2005, he got the George Arents Pioneer Medal\u2014Syracuse's highest alumni award\u2014\"for excellence in public affairs.\"\nIn 2008, Biden got the Best of Congress Award, for \"improving the American quality of life through family-friendly work policies,\" from \"Working Mother\" magazine. \nAlso in 2008, Biden shared with fellow Senator Richard Lugar the Hilal-i-Pakistan award from the Government of Pakistan, \"in recognition of their consistent support for Pakistan.\" In 2009, Biden got The Golden Medal of Freedom award from Kosovo, that region's highest award, for his vocal support for their independence in the late 1990s.\nBiden is an member of the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association Hall of Fame.\nIn 2017, during his final days as president, Barack Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction.\nIn 2020, Biden and his Vice President Kamala Harris were named Time Person of the Year."}

The word is used in music to mean songs written by French composers of classical music from the mid-19th century to the present. The \"m\u00e9lodie\" in French music is similar to the \"Lied\" in German music. \"\"M\u00e9lodie\" is not the same as \"chanson\" (the French word for \u201csong\u201d). The word \"chanson\"\" is used for folksongs or popular songs.\nHistory.\nIn Germany composers of classical music had been writing great songs from about 1800, but in France the \"m\u00e9lodie\" became important about 50 years later. While some German \"Lieder\" were based on folksong, the texts of the \"m\u00e9lodie\"s were usually poems by serious poets. \nHector Berlioz was the first composer to call some of his compositions \"m\u00e9lodie\"s. His \"Les Nuits d'\u00c9t\u00e9\" (1841) is one of the greatest of all song cycles. Charles Gounod wrote about 200 \"m\u00e9lodie\"s. He used texts by famous poets such as Hugo.\nGabriel Faur\u00e9 wrote more than 100 \"m\u00e9lodie\"s, many based on poems by Verlaine.\nHenri Duparc wrote seventeen \"m\u00e9lodie\"s. These are what he is known for.\nClaude Debussy and Maurice Ravel were very famous composers who wrote a lot of music, including \"m\u00e9lodie\"s that are often sung today. Ravel\u2019s melodies are unusual because they are often based on folksong. Other composers of \"m\u00e9lodie\" at the time include Albert Roussel, Reynaldo Hahn and Andr\u00e9 Caplet.\n\"M\u00e9lodie\"s continue to be composed today, though perhaps the last really popular composer of them was Francis Poulenc, who died in 1963.\nPerforming \"m\u00e9lodie\"s.\nIn the French \"m\u00e9lodie\" the poet\u2019s feelings are often suggested or hinted at rather than stated in an obvious way. There is a very close relationship between the text (words) and the melody. To sing \"m\u00e9lodie\" really well a singer must know the French language very well and understand a lot about French poetry. The rules about singing in the French language can be quite complicated. It is important to know when to let the last sound of a word run into the next word (elision). Several books have been written about this.\nAlthough many famous singers are well known for singing French \"m\u00e9lodie\", the most famous singer from the past was Pierre Bernac. He gave many song recitals with the composer Francis Poulenc who accompanied him on the piano. He wrote a book on how to sing \"m\u00e9lodie\"s."}

They play at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the Triple-A East (a group of 20\u00a0baseball teams at the same level). The Sounds are partnered with the Milwaukee Brewers, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Brewers.\nThe team is named \"Sounds\" because Nashville, the city where the team plays, is famous for making country music.\nThe Sounds played at a stadium called Herschel Greer Stadium from 1978 to 2014. In 2015, the Sounds began to play at a new stadium called First Horizon Park.\nHistory.\nThe Sounds started playing baseball in 1978 in the Southern League, which is at the Double-A (AA) level, two levels before Major League Baseball. They were partnered with the Cincinnati Reds (1978\u20131979) and New York Yankees (1980\u20131984). The Sounds won the championship of the Southern League in 1979 and 1982.\nIn 1985, the Sounds began to play at the Triple-A level in a league called the American Association. While playing in this league, they were partnered with the Detroit Tigers (1985\u20131986), Cincinnati Reds (1987\u20131992), and Chicago White Sox (1993\u20131997).\nThe American Association ended after the 1997 season, so the Sounds started playing in the Pacific Coast League in 1998. They were partners with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1998\u20132004), Milwaukee Brewers (2005\u20132014), Oakland Athletics (2015\u20132018), and Texas Rangers (2019\u20132020). The Sounds won the championship of the Pacific Coast League in 2005.\nMajor League Baseball reorganized Minor League Baseball before the 2021 season. The Pacific Coast League was ended, and the Sounds began playing in the Triple-A East in 2021. They also became partners with the Milwaukee Brewers.\nBallparks.\nThe Sounds' first ballpark was Herschel Greer Stadium. They played baseball games there from 1978 to 2014. There were many changes to the ballpark after it was completed in 1978. It had seats for 10,300\u00a0spectators. Its best known feature was its giant 115.6\u00a0foot (35.2\u00a0m) scoreboard which was behind the left field wall and shaped like a guitar. After the construction of new and luxurious minor league ballparks in the 1990s, Greer had fallen below standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball. Therefore, there were several repairs and upgrades made to meet Triple-A standards until a new stadium could be built. Greer Stadium was demolished in 2019.\nIn 2014, the Sounds and the city of Nashville agreed on a plan to build a new baseball stadium for the team. The Sounds began playing baseball at the new stadium, called First Horizon Park, in 2015. It has space for 10,000\u00a0spectators. There are 8,500 seats, and there is a spot of grass where 1,500 others can sit. It also has a guitar-shaped scoreboard."}

This SuperDisk was introduced by Iomega in 1995 as ZD. But the SuperDisks were not expanded because of slowness and unreliability in comparison with ZD.\nSuperDisk 120MB Diskettes may still be available in the marketplace, however are no longer warranted. We do not have information about where these products can be purchased.\nOnce a drive fails, it may be impossible or expensive to get data off the diskettes.\nSuperDisk diskettes are etched with a servo pattern at the factory. This pattern is then read by the SuperDisk drive to precisely align the read/write head. The result is that a SuperDisk diskette can have 2,490 tracks, as opposed to the 160 tracks that conventional 3.5-inch 1.44 MB diskettes use. \nUnlike other removable disk storage solutions, such as the Zip drive, SuperDisk is backward compatible with older diskettes. This means that the same SuperDisk drive can be used to read and write to older 1.44 MB diskettes as well as the new 120 MB SuperDisk diskettes. \nHere are some current data storage and backup technologies that Imation supplies for a variety of customer needs.

During the 17th century the French courante started to become slower than the Italian corrente, and it often had more counterpoint (imitating parts). However, this was not a strict rule, and the courantes that Bach wrote were both Italian and French in style, and sometimes he called them \"courante\" and sometimes \"corrente\".\nComposers of the Baroque period often composed a group of several dances.

There was always a small stress (Tenuto) on the second beat of the bar. The note on the first beat would often be played quite short so that the second beat would feel heavy. Like the other dance movements in the suite, the Sarabande was in Binary form.\nThe sarabande seems to have come from Central America where it was known as \"zarabanda\". Although it was mainly used in the Baroque Period, composers in the 20th Century such as Debussy, Satie, Howells and Britten sometimes wrote Sarabandes.\nPerhaps the most famous Sarabande is one written by an unknown composer. The piece is called \"La folie espagnole\". Many Baroque composers such as Monteverdi and Corelli and even some modern ones used this well-known tune.\nMovies.\nThe sarabande has been used a lot in movies, including one by Ingmar Bergman called \"Saraband\" (2003).

The Baroque suite normally had an Allemande, a Courante, a Sarabande and a Gigue to finish with. Sometimes there were one or two other movements as well.\nThe gigue usually has a compound metre such as 6/8, 6/4, 9/8 or 12/16.

It later became a Roman village in 180 BC. The Romans built an amphitheatre that is still seen in the Piazza dell'Anfiteatro. Lucca was an important city and fortress even in the 6th century, when Narses attacked it over and over again for several months in 553. During the 10th and 11th centuries, Lucca was the capital of the feudal territories of Tuscany, with more power about the Roman Emperor.\nAfter the death of Matilda of Tuscany, the city began an independent commune. For almost 500 years, Lucca remained an independent republic. There were many minor communes in the region between southern Liguria and northern Tuscany (which was filled by the Malaspina). Tuscany in this time was part of feudal Europe. Dante\u2019s \"Divine Comedy\" was written to remember the days spent in his exile in Lucca.\nIn 1273 and again in 1277, Lucca was ruled by a Guelph (captain of the people) named Luchetto Gattilusio. In 1314, after internal problems Uguccione della Faggiuola of Pisa make himself lord of Lucca. The people of the city made him leave two years later and \"condottiere\" gain the leadership. In 1325, in the battle of Altopascio, Lucca soldiers defeated Florence's Guelphs with the help of Castracani, a leader of the city in time of war. After they won, Castracani was named \"Duke of Lucca\" by Louis IV the Bavarian. Until the French Revolution in 1789, Lucca was independent from Venice and Genoa. It was a city controlled by democracy or sometimes by oligarchy.\nRepublic of Lucca.\nLucca was the second largest Italian city-state (after Venice) with a republican constitution (\"comune\"). In 1805 Lucca was taken over by Napoleon, who put his sister Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi in the place reserved for the \"Queen of Etruria\". The city became a part of Tuscany in 1847 and later a part of Italy.\nImportant monuments.\nThe walls around the old town are intact as the city grew and became more modern. This is unusual for cities in the region. A famous place is the house where Puccini was born. The house is open to the public.\nThere are many churches in Lucca:\nOther sights include:\nCulture.\nEvery year in Lucca there are two important festivals.

It is a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. To encipher or encode is to convert information from plain text into cipher or code. \nIn non-technical usage, a 'cipher' often means the same thing as a 'code'; but in cryptography, ciphers are distinguished from codes. One 20th century source gives this explanation: a cipher is \"a method in which the basic unit of concealment is the letter. In comparison, a code is a form of concealment in which the basic unit is the word\". Late in the century, \"codes\" in this cryptographic sense became rare. 21st century cryptography mostly encrypts bitstreams.\nCodes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase. For example, \"UQJHSE\" could be the code for \"Proceed to the following coordinates\".\nA cipher is used to turn the original information (\"plaintext\") to the encrypted form \"ciphertext\". The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but cannot be read by human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.\nTo encipher or decipher, you need the \"key\". In encryption, a key specifies the particular transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, or vice versa during decryption.\nBy type of key used ciphers are divided into:\nThe word cipher in French is \"cifre\" and in Medieval Latin \"cifra\", from the Arabic \"sifr\", meaning 'zero'. The first known English use of \"zero\" was in 1598."}

He told them that they had been very rebellious towards God, so God made them travel from place to place before reaching the land he promised them. This was the fortieth year they travelled.\nThe Causes.\nMoses told the Israelites what had happened throughout their journey. He scolded them for disobeying God, who made them go through a very hard journey. Moses then gave them the Law, teaching them what must be done, and what cannot be done. These laws were given to him by God. (See Ten Commandments.) The Law warns against worshipping other gods, and tells that all Israel, every one, must obey God alone. He warned them against worshipping idols, and commanded them to treat the poor, foreigners, and orphans well. If the Israelites obey God, they will prosper (be successful). But God predicted that the future generations will suffer because of their disobedience. One day, however the Israelites would return to God.\nThe Tablets.\nGod then commanded Moses to write the Law on stone tablets for the Israelites to remember. Then Moses formally made Joshua, son of Nun, the new leader over the Israelites. God gave Moses a song to sing, and asked him to teach it to the Israelites. The song would remind them in the future about how they had gone against God.\nThe death of Moses.\nMoses was very old - 120 years - during that time. He knew he was going to die because God had told him it would happen. Therefore, before he died, he gave a blessing to all the twelve tribes of Israel.\nFinally God made Moses climb Mount Nebo and showed him all the land he was giving to Israel. Because Moses and his brother Aaron disobeyed God earlier on, Moses was not allowed to enter the land, only to see it. Moses died on Mount Nebo, and the Israelites mourned for him for thirty days. After that Joshua began to lead Israel under God's command."}

SCSI stands for Small Computer System Interface, although the \"small\" is historic; SCSI is used on both large and small computers. SCSI is usually pronounced as \"scuzzy\". \nFew peripherals (other than hard drives and tape drives) were made after the 20th century. Later ones used USB or in some cases Firewire.\nPhysical Structure.\nSCSI is realized by a bus slot on the motherboard. Just to put a card called host adapter to the motherboard. From this card is a managed data cable. This cable connects individual SCSI peripherals. Each of this peripherals has its own sequencer which is functional independent. Operation on data cable (bus SCSI) is controlled by the host adapter. This makes it possible to install internal or external components. Transferring data on the SCSI bus is managed by the host adapter. The CPU is not loaded by transferring data.\nAdvantages.\nEach peripheral has its own sequencer and host adapter. They can be used for communication with devices by a defined \"computer\" language. They could also cooperate with arbitrary peripherals of SCSI. At present there are hard disks, optical drives, tape adapter units, ZIP drives, scanners and printers using SCSI. \nSCSI is not restricted by conditions (for example: by data capacity). One of the main advantages of SCSI is a possibility to daisy-chain devices. There is some device on the bus SCSI which controls this. \nFor example, hard disk defines \u201chead's of operations\u201d etc. At the same moment the other device could send data to other devices, (scanner). Operations of other device are not cancelled with origin connection. After transferring data to scanner device could continues with transferring data to hard disk. SCSI is faster because of this fact even maximal speed of transferring is not so different to EIDE.\nConfigured rules.\nEach peripheral of SCSI has to be identified. That is the reason why every peripheral must have a unique ID. This number is set by bond or shunt located on the case of components. In terms of a bus is enumerate from 0, hostname has as a rule ID 7. There cannot be two devices on the same bus with the same ID.\nBuses have to be finished with resistances, in terminology called terminators. On the last devices is necessary to install terminators.\nHost adapter has to be in connection with to assign system resources (addresses I/O, IRQ, DMA, reserved memory).\nProgression.\nSCSI has a long progression. That is why there are many kind of SCSI in the present day. They are different in data width (8 or 16 bits) and working frequency (from 5\u00a0MHz to 80\u00a0MHz). With 8-bit data width, the parallel SCSI bus can be connected to 8 devices (used a 50 pin connector); with 16 bits, the SCSI bus can be connected to 16 devices.\nOther SCSI interfaces.\nIn addition to the parallel SCSI interface, there are also other interfaces that use the SCSI protocol but use different cables."}

No doubt, modern science has advanced knowledge in a wide range of fields. How has it done this? To tackle this issue, a number of other issues also have to be tackled.\nWhat makes science distinct?\nSome people think that in earlier times, science was nothing but organized common sense. Thomas Henry Huxley thought this. However, during the twentieth century, science produced many ideas which were nothing like common sense, like general relativity. Then it was clear that science really was something different from common sense. But what was it? This is called the demarcation problem.\nThe demarcation problem refers to the distinction between science and non-science (like pseudoscience). Karl Popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science. No solution to the problem has had full agreement among philosophers; some of them think the problem is insoluble or uninteresting.\nThe logical positivists tried to base science on observation. In their view, truth was achieved by logic and observation. Non-science was non-observational and meaningless.\nAgainst that, Popper argued that the central property of science is falsifiability. All scientific claims can be proved false, at least in principle. If no such proof can be found despite sufficient effort, then the claim is likely true. Popper's ideas were applauded by many scientists (like Peter Medawar). However, skeptics noticed that ideas were often not discarded when a prediction was refuted. The ideas were simply adjusted to take into account the new findings. It was clear from this that, although falsifiability was important, it could not be a simple way to distinguish science from non-science.\nOther approaches were tried. One idea that science was a problem-solving process aimed at finding answers to questions. Of course, many other fields try to answer questions and solve problems. Another approach was to define science as the search for objective truth. But objectivity is very hard to define, and whether science really is objective is open to question.\nWith biology, the situation wasn't the same as other parts of science. There were thousands of published observations, and Darwin showed that sense could be made of the observations. He used those ideas to prove evolution had taken place. In a natural history science (such as biology, geology or astronomy), one of the main jobs of science is to explain what has happened and what is seen. Obviously, explanations as well as observations and theories are part of the philosophy of science.\nTheories and observations.\nBoth theory and observations are part of science, and they are tied together in a kind of cycle. A clear example was the prediction of Einstein that a source of gravity (such as a star) would bend light passing nearby. An expedition was organised in 1919 to record the positions of stars around the Sun during a solar eclipse. It showed that the positions of the stars close to the Sun were changed slightly from their normal expected positions. The light passing close to the Sun was pulled towards the sun by gravitation. This seemed to prove Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915. Many year later, the proof was shown to be wrong. But by then other observations (of time dilation) showed that Einstein actually was right. Gravitational lensing proved that light was pulled towards the Sun.\nThe point here is that the observation and the theory were connected. The observation would not have been made but for the theory, and then the observation was convincing evidence in favour of the theory. The theory had passed a critical test. Since then, many more tests have been made of Einstein's ideas, and all have been consistent with his theory.\nA \u201cnaive\u201d conception of science.\nAccording to common sense, science begins with observations: all scientific knowledge come from the facts of experience. Theories are produced by observation of these facts and are then tested by prediction.\nHere is a schema of this idea of science that some philosophers call a \"naive\" conception of science:\n ---&gt; INDUCTION ---&gt; LAWS AND THEORIES ---&gt; DEDUCTION ---&gt;\n | |\n FACTS OF EXPERIENCE PREDICTIONS AND EXPLANATIONSFACTS OF EXPERIENCE\nThis naive conception is not held by many philosophers today. For one thing, it sees science as a one-way engine from 'facts' (what are they?) to theories and predictions. As shown by the Einstein example, where a theory led the other way round, the model does not fit much of science. In fact the relationship between the parts of a scientific philosophy are extremely complex.\nTesting a prediction.\nAccording to Pierre Duhem and W.V. Quine, it is impossible to test a theory in isolation. For example, to test Newton's Law of Gravitation in our solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets. Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of Uranus in the 19th century did not lead to the rejection of Newton's Law. Instead, it lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that there are only seven planets in our solar system. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, Neptune. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, etc.\nOne consequence of the Duhem-Quine thesis is that any theory can be made compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of extra (ad hoc) hypotheses. This is why science uses Occam's Razor; hypotheses without justification are eliminated. This led Karl Popper, to reject na\u00efve falsification in favor of 'survival of the fittest', or most falsifiable, of scientific theories. In Popper's view, any hypothesis that does not make testable predictions is simply not science. Such a hypothesis may be useful or valuable, but it cannot be said to be science. W.V. Quine thought that empirical data are not enough to make a judgment between theories. In this view, a theory can always be made to fit with the available empirical data. However, this does not necessarily imply that all theories are of equal value, because scientists often use guiding principles such as Occam's Razor.\nOne result of this view is that specialists in the philosophy of science stress the requirement that observations made for the purposes of science be restricted to \"intersubjective\" objects. That is, science is restricted to those areas where there is general agreement on the nature of the observations involved. It is comparatively easy to agree on observations of physical phenomena, harder to agree on observations of social or mental phenomena, and difficult in the extreme to reach agreement on matters of theology or ethics (and thus the latter remain outside the normal purview of science).\nOther ideas.\nCritiques of scientific method.\nIs there any scientific method at all? Paul Feyerabend argued that no description of scientific method could possibly encompass all the approaches and methods used by scientists. Feyerabend objected to prescriptive scientific method on the grounds that any such method would stifle and cramp scientific progress. Feyerabend claimed, \"the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: \"anything goes\"\".\nScientific revolutions.\nThomas Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded. He argued that observations always rely on a specific paradigm, and that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. By \"paradigm\" he meant a consistent \"portrait\" of the world, one that involves no logical contradictions and that is consistent with observations made from the point of view of the paradigm. More than one such logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Neither is a standard by which the other can be judged. Instead, the question is which \"portrait\" is judged by some set of people to promise the most useful in terms of scientific \"puzzle solving\".\nFor Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by, but not ultimately determined by, logical processes. The individual's choice between paradigms involves setting two or more \"portraits\" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. In the case of a general acceptance of one paradigm or another, Kuhn believed that it represented the consensus of the community of scientists. Acceptance or rejection of some paradigm is, he argued, a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism. According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a number of observational anomalies (problems) in the old paradigm have made the new paradigm more useful. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. A new paradigm is chosen because it does a better job of solving scientific problems than the old one.\nThe fact that observation is embedded in theory does not mean observations are irrelevant to science. Scientific understanding derives from observation, but the acceptance of scientific statements is dependent on the related theoretical paradigm as well as on observation. Of course, further testing may resolve differences of opinion."}

It is made up of a flat, touch-sensitive surface which the user slides one or more fingers on to move the cursor on the screen. Next to the touchpad are push-buttons that work just like mouse buttons, including left-clicking and right-clicking. In some newer touchpads, there are no actual buttons, and clicking is done by pushing near the button of the touchpad itself.\nUnlike computer mice, touchpads stay in one place when they are being used. This makes it easy to build them into hardware. They are mostly found on laptop computers because, when the user is travelling, sometimes he or she cannot use a mouse. But most laptops do allow the user is able to attach (connect) a separate mouse. Besides laptops, touchpads are also more and more used on mobile devices with a GUI, including MP3 players (a well-known one being the iPod) and mobile phones (such as the BlackBerry). However, touchpads on today's mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers have been replaced with the touchscreen, which is used much like a touchpad except the screen is built into the touch-sensitive surface itself so that no mouse cursor is needed. One can just touch anywhere on the surface to choose what is on the screen at that part.\nMost touchpads have the function of tapping, which imitates the left-click button on a mouse. New models of touchpads often do more things because they can respond to the pressure of more than one finger. This is called multi-touch and makes it possible to do things like scroll though, zoom in and out, and rotate a page or part of the screen. The user can choose and change which functions happen if the user does certain moves. For example, the normal function for tapping on the pad is the left-click on the mouse.

They are used to unlock doors and in other security applications. During the 2010s fingerprint scanners became commonplace on mobile phones.\nPeople have a pattern of ridges on their fingers. This fingerprint cannot be removed or changed. Every fingerprint is different from any other in the world. Because there are countless combinations, fingerprints are much used for identification.\nVarious Types.\nOptical reflexive.\nThey are based on the oldest technique, that consists of placing your finger on a glass surface or a prism that is illuminated by a led diode. When the ridges of fingerprints touch the surface, the light is absorbed, while between these crests a total reflection occurs. The resulting light and dark areas are recorded in an image sensor. \nIn practice there are some difficulties with this technique: wet and dry fingers make very different images, and the system is sensitive to dust and dirt on the surface. The unit is large and expensive. This system is also easy to cheat and if the skin is damaged, the fingerprint is not recognized correctly. The recognition of the fingerprint of older people is also difficult to do because their skin may not be elastic enough. In some circumstances this may result in false recognition. If the stored fingerprint was taken with less pressure, false acceptances may occur.\nCapacitive.\nThe sensor is a silicon integrated circuit with a surface that is covered by a large number of transducer elements (or pixels), with a typical resolution of 500 dpi. Each element contains two adjacent metal electrodes. The capacitance between the electrodes, which forms a feedback path for an inverting amplifier, is reduced when the finger is applied to said surface: it is further reduced when it detects ridges and less reduced when it detects the space between them.\nThe sensor is susceptible to electrostatic discharge. These sensors only work with normal healthy skins, they are not operative being used on skins with hard areas, calluses or scars. Moisture, grease or dust can also affect its operation.\nMechanical.\nIt consists of tens of thousands of tiny pressure transducers that are mounted on the surface of the sensor. An alternative design uses switches that are closed when pressed by a ridge, but that stay open when they are under a valley. This only provides one bit of information per pixel, instead of working with a gray scale.\nThermal.\nIn this case the heat driven by the finger is detected, which is greater when there is a ridge than when there is a valley. A silicon component has been developed with a matrix of pixels called \"FingerChip\", that is, \"finger integrated circuit\", each of which is covered with a layer of pyroelectric material in which a change in temperature translates into a change in the load distribution of its surface. The image is in the gray scale that has the right quality even with the finger worn, with dirt, with grease or with humidity. The sensor has a robust protective layer and can provide a dynamic output.\nDynamic output.\nMost of the sensors described have been altered in the past. To avoid this, a new operating mode has been added. Instead of simply placing your finger statically on the sensor, the finger moves slowly along it. The sensor only has a narrow sensitive area, and generates a complete sequence of images, which can be reassembled, by means of a processor, in a complete image. The benefits are improved appreciably and the elimination of any residual grease is guaranteed.\nUse.\nThe most important use area is in access control for computers. This is especially important for laptops and PDAs. Thanks to the price falling, more and more devices are equipped with sensors. Other devices with built-in fingerprint sensors include USB hard drives, USB memory modules and card readers. They are also available in mice and keyboards. \nSensors are increasingly used to secure financial transactions and change machines for \"online\" banking. In the future, the owner's fingerprint will be stored securely on identity cards and credit cards and may also be used for authentication of emails using digital signatures.\nDirect physical access to rooms and devices can also be ensured by coupling fingerprint sensors with door opening systems.\nConstruction forms.\nThere are two construction forms: the stagnant and the moving fingerprint scanner."}

It was found by Johann Palisa on February 25, 1892 in Vienna, making it one of the last big (diameter over 200\u00a0km) asteroids found. Apart from the near-earth asteroid Eros, it was the last asteroid which is \"ever\" easily visible with binoculars to be found.\nAlthough its very high orbital eccentricity means its opposition magnitude varies a lot, at a rare opposition near perihelion Bamberga can reach a magnitude of +8.0, which is as bright as Saturn's moon Titan. Such near-perihelion oppositions happen on a regular cycle every twenty-two years, with the last happening in 1991 and the next in 2013. Its brightness at these rare near-perihelion oppositions makes Bamberga the \"brightest C-type asteroid\", about one magnitude brighter than 10 Hygiea's maximum brightness of around +9.1. At such an opposition Bamberga can in fact be closer to Earth than any main belt asteroid with magnitude above +9.5, getting as close as 0.78 AU. For comparison, 7 Iris never comes closer than 0.85 AU and 4 Vesta never closer than 1.13 AU when it becomes visible to the naked eye in a pollution-free sky.\nOverall Bamberga is the tenth brightest main belt asteroid after, in order, Vesta, Pallas, Ceres, Iris, Hebe, Juno, Melpomene, Eunomia and Flora. Its high eccentricity (for comparison 36% higher than that of Pluto), though, means that at most oppositions other asteroids reach higher magnitudes.\nIt has an unusually long rotation period among the big asteroids. Its spectral class is between the C-type and P-type asteroids.\nAn occultation of Bamberga was seen on 8 December, 1987, and gave a diameter of about 228\u00a0km, in agreement with IRAS results."}

He was one of the most important composers of madrigals in the Renaissance period.\nLife.\nWe know very little about his childhood. Even some of the things about his adult life we are not sure about. He was born in Flanders, possibly in Ghent. When he was a boy he was taken to Italy and he stayed there for the rest of his life.\nAs a boy he was a singer in the household of Maria di Cardona, Marchesa of Padulla, near Naples. As a young man he lived in Novellara. He married there, and he had at least six children.\nLater he went to live in Milan where he had the job of maestro di capella (music director). He stayed there until 1565. Some letters he wrote during that time have survived. They describe life at the court where he worked.\nIn 1565 he went to work for the Gonzaga in Mantua and became choir master at the ducal chapel of S. Barbara where he stayed until 1592. A lot of people were jealous of his good job, especially a man called Bonvicino who made life difficult for him. It was then found that Bonvicino was having a love affair with de Wert\u2019s wife, so she had to go back to live in Novellara.\nDe Wert was becoming a very well known composer. He was offered a job at the emperor\u2019s palace in Prague, but he did not take it. He travelled to work in various places such as Parma and Novellara. In Novellara his wife was found to have been plotting against the Gonzaga of Novellara. She was put in prison where she later died. There were long arguments in the law court about who should have her property. In the end, de Wert was given a third of her possessions, and he was given the right to let his children inherit the money.\nHe worked in Ferrara where he had a love affair with a lady who was of aristocratic birth. Since he was only a musician he was only a servant, so the lady was sent away from the court.\nIn his later years he worked for the court at Mantua where the music had become very good because the new ruler, Vincenzo Gonzaga, was very interested in music. De Wert composed music for the theatre. His health became poor. He suffered from malaria during the early 1580s. He died in Mantua and was buried in the crypt at S Barbara.\nMusic and influence.\nDe Wert wrote over 230 madrigals and other secular works. These were later published in 16 volumes. He also wrote over 150 sacred pieces (motets, hymns etc.) which showed how well he could write counterpoint. \nHis madrigals were very modern for their time. The music was very daring in the way it described the words. He sometimes used small groups of singers to contrast with one another like a musical conversation. He was a great influence on later madrigal composers such as Monteverdi and Gesualdo. "}

It has been published every week since March 1952. It was the first British magazine to include a singles chart.\nHistory.\nThe magazine's first issue was published on 7 March 1952. It was first published in a non-glossy tabloid format on standard newsprint.\n1960s.\nDuring the 1960s, the magazine championed the new British groups emerging at the time. The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were frequently on the front cover a lot. These and other artists would also appeared at the NME Poll Winners Concert, an awards event that featured artists voted as most popular by the NME's readers. The concert also featured an awards ceremony where the poll winners would collect their awards.\nThe later part of the 1960s, the magazine began to report about psychedelia as well as the continuation of articles about British groups of the time.\n1970s.\nIn early 1972, with the magazine on the verge of closure by its owners, But a new person became editor and the paper's coverage changed radically from an uncritical to something intended to be smarter, hipper, more cynical and funnier than any mainstream British music paper had previously been (an approach influenced mainly by writers).\nIn mid-1973, the paper was selling nearly 300,000 copies per week and was outselling its other weekly rivals, \"Disc\", \"Record Mirror\" and \"Sounds\".\nThe year 1976 saw Punk Rock arrive on the music scene and \"NME\", like other \"specialist\" publications, was slow in reporting and covering this new music phenomenon. In an attempt to boost sales, the paper advertised for a pair of \"hip young gunslingers\" to join their editorial staff. This resulted in the recruitment of two journalists who made sure the magazine was completely up to date on this new music style. Bands who a few months previously had been criticising the \"NME\" were now eager to be included.\nThe magazine also became more openly political during the time of Punk. Its cover would sometimes feature youth-oriented issues rather than a musical act.\n1980s.\nSales were dropping, and by 1985 \"NME\" had hit a rough patch and was in danger of closing again. During this period, the editors at the magazine were split between those who wanted to write about hip hop, a genre that was relatively new to the UK, and those who wanted to stick to rock music. Sales were apparently lower when photos of hip hop artists appeared on the front and this led to the paper suffering as the lack of direction became even more apparent to readers.\nThe late eighties and early nineties had a generally weak rock scene in the UK and the paper was forced into giving a high profile to long forgotten bands like Kingmaker and the Railway Children.\n1990s.\nBy the end of 1990, although the magazine still supported new British bands, the paper was dominated by American bands, because that was what the music scene in general was about.\nAlthough the period from 1991 to 1993 was dominated by American bands like Nirvana, this did not mean that British bands were being ignored. The \"NME\" still covered the Indie scene a lot.\nBy 1992, some new British bands were beginning to appear. \"Suede\" were quickly hailed by the paper as an alternative to the heavy Grunge sound and hailed as the start of a new British music scene. Indie however was still the dominant force, but the rise of new British bands would become something the paper would focus more and more upon.\nIn April 1994 Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found dead, a story which affected not only his fans and readers of the \"NME\", but would see a massive change in British music. Grunge was about to be replaced by Britpop , a new form of music influenced by British music of the 1960s and British culture. The phrase was coined by \"NME\" after the band Blur released their album \"Parklife\" in the same month of Cobain's death. Britpop began to fill the musical and cultural void left after Cobain's death, and Blur's success, along with the rise of a new group from Manchester called Oasis saw Britpop gather popularity for the rest of 1994. By the end of the year Blur and Oasis were the two biggest bands in the UK and sales of the \"NME\" were increasing thanks to the Britpop effect.\n1995 saw the \"NME\" cover many of these new bands and saw many of these bands play the \"NME Stage\" at that years Glastonbury Festival where the magazine had been sponsoring the second stage at the festival since 1993.\n2000s.\nThe new millennium saw the \"NME\" focus on new British bands such as Franz Ferdinand and the Kaiser Chiefs who emerged as \"indie music\" continued to grow in commercial success. This commercial success has led to bands such as the Arctic Monkeys being both successful in the extreme and being championed by the NME; a phenomenon not seen since Britpop.\nIn December 2005 accusations were made that the \"NME\" end of year poll had been edited for commercial and political reasons. These criticisms were rebutted by McNicholas, who claimed that webzine Londonist.com had got hold of an early draft of the poll.\nIn 2006 NME won the CocaCola best magazine this century award.\nNME.COM.\nIts first editor was Brendan Fitzgerald. Later Anthony Thornton redesigned the site, focusing on music news. The website was awarded Online Magazine Of The Year in 1999 and 2001 and Anthony Thornton was announced as Website Editor Of The Year on three occasions.\nIt was awarded 'Best Music Website' at the Record Of The Day awards in October 2005.

Its capital city has the same name, Pedernales.\nIt was created on 16 December 1957. It was a municipality of the Barahona province before being elevated to the category of province.\nName.\nThe province was named after the Pedernales river; this river forms the southern border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. And the river is named Pedernales because the mineral flint () is common in the region.\nHistory.\nSome native groups lived close to the coast and the River Pedernales before the conquest of the island by European people. But very few people has lived in the region, for most of its history, because it is a very dry region.\nIn his second travel to America, Christopher Columbus sighted and named part of the present island, including the Beata and Alto Velo islands, that are part of the province.\nUntil the 20th century, the only people living here were Haitians and many places have French names. Sometimes, during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856), Haitian soldiers came across this region because there were not Dominican soldiers. The only fight between soldiers of the two countries in the territory of the present province was close to the \"El Can\" bay, near the town of Juancho, on 6 January 1856.\nSince colonial times, the territory was part of the Azua province until it was changed to the Barahona when Barahona became a province in 1881. The province of Pedernales was created in 1957 with the municipalities of Pedernales, its capital, and Oviedo.\nJuancho became a municipal district in 1998 and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez Oviedo in 2005.\nLocation.\nThe Pedernales province is in the southwest of the country. It is bordered to the north by the province of Independencia, to the northeast by Barahona, to the east, south and west by the Caribbean Sea. To the west Pedernales borders the Republic of Haiti.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Pedernales province, and 20,345 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km\u00b2.\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 32nd (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province, the province with fewest people living in it and with the lowest population density.\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 33,755 inhabitants.\nThe largest city of the province is Pedernales, its head municipality or capital, with an urban population (in ) of 13,077 inhabitants.\nGeography.\nThe Pedernales province has a total area of . It has of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 7th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.\nThe province is in the Barahona Peninsula. The \"Sierra de Bahoruco\" (\"Bahoruco mountain range\") is in the northern half of the province; its highest mountain, and the highest mountain of the province, is \"Loma del Toro\", above sea level, in the limits with the Independencia province.\nThe rest of the province is formed by savannas and plains of limestone rocks. The savannas are close to the coast, as the Sans\u00f3n Savanna in Oviedo and the Pedernales Savanna around the city of Pedernales.\nSeveral small islands belong to the province. The main islands are Beata and Alto Velo.\nThe altitude of Pedernales, provincial capital, is above sea level.\nThe only important river is the Pedernales river, with its tributary Mulito. The Pedernales river marks the Dominican-Haitian border.\nThere are several lagoons (a lagoon is a small lake close to the sea) with brackish water. The most important is the \"Laguna de Oviedo\", on the eastern coast and near the town of Oviedo, with an area of . On the western coast, the most important lagoon is \"Laguna Salada\", with an area of .\nClimate.\nThe climate of the province is tropical, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains. It is very dry in the savannas and plains, with long droughts, but rains are common in the high mountains.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are two municipalities and two municipal districts (M.D.) in the province.\nEconomy.\nAs in all border provinces in the Dominican Republic, there is little economic development. The trade with Haiti is important, above all in the capital city. On the mountains, coffee and beans are important products. Potato, cabbage and other vegetables are produced in the Sierra de Bahoruco.\nFishing is also an important activity in the province, mainly close to the Beata Island, where lobster, conch and several kind of fishes are caught.\nBecause of the beautiful beaches of the western coast of the province, like \"Bah\u00eda de las \u00c1guilas\" (\"Eagles Bay\"), tourism is becoming an important economic activity. There are two of the largest national parks of the country: the \"Jaragua National Park\" and the \"Sierra de Bahoruco National Park\".\nThe development of the province was produced by the mining of bauxite (an aluminium ore) but, since 1984, it has changed to the mining of limestone to send to other countries and for a cement factory."}

The net went all the way across the harbour from Green Point, Watson's Bay to Georges Head on the other side. The boom was part of the Sydney Harbour defences which also included artillery batteries and patrol boats.\nHistory.\nIn January 1942, the Australian defence forces began to build the anti-submarine boom net; it was finished in August 1942. For more than three years, entry by boats, ships and ferries into Sydney Harbour was through one of three different gates that were a part of the anti-submarine boom net.\nOn 31 May 1942, during WWII, three Japanese submarines tried to get into the harbour. The first submarine to try and come in was the M27. Lieutenant Jahai Chuma was the man in charge of this submarine. The M27 followed a Sydney ferry through the gate on its way to Manly, but it got caught in the western end of the net's middle section. Lieutenant Chuma, tried to free his submarine by using a special tool that cuts metal, but this only made things worse. By 8:30pm the watchman for the Maritime Service Board, James Cargill, went to see what was happening. He used a boat to row across to where the submarine was stuck. Very surprised at finding a Japanese submarine, Cargill called naval headquarters with his two way radio. At first the navy did not believe that there was a Japanese Midget submarine caught in the boom net. It took him two hours to get them to believe him.\nBy 10:27pm, Chuma knew that he had been discovered, so he blew up the submarine using bombs, killing himself and his crew. The two other submarines got through the boom net, which at the time was not quite finished. They attacked shipping for many hours before they were destroyed as well.\nIn August 1945, the boom net was taken away. By early 1946, only the dolphin structure was left. The base of the winch house is the only remaining part of the anti-submarine boom net. It can still be seen at Green Point."}

There are three types of hair iron: \nHistory.\nIn 1872, Marcel Grateau (a Parisian) used heated rods to curl or style hair.\nIn 1893, Ada Harris, a school teacher from Indianapolis, applied for a patent for the hair straightener. The hair straightener was a device \u201cheated like a curling iron\u201d with two flat faces held together by a hinge . It was said that when the faces press the hair, it will become straight.\u201d Harris's invention also had a comb, which would keep different parts of the hair separated.\nSimon E. Monroe patented a hair straightener in 1906 that was like a metal comb.\nIn 1909, Issac K. Shero patented a hair straightener made of two irons that are heated and put together around the hair.\nYears later, Sharrell made heated metal tools, for example: hot combs. The hot metal straightener went easily through the hair, making less damage and dryness than the way things were done before. Later, ceramic and electrical straighteners were made, meaning people could adjust the heat settings and straightener size.\nAnother method of hair straightening is Japanese hair straightening, which was invented in Japan, and works like a perm, but to straighten instead of curl the hair. It is now given at many salons but is quite expensive and must be re-done after it stops working.\nThe straightening irons of today.\nSome better hair straighteners today have ceramic coated heating parts, which harm the hair less, and heat up faster than non-ceramic coated heating parts. Cheaper brands do not often have ceramic, but some have a paint-like coating that looks like ceramic plating. Cordless flat irons use lithium battery that can last up to 45 minutes, and other is heated by thermacell butane gas cartridge.\nLots of more expensive hair straighteners use ionic and infra red technology, which helps to keep moisture and oils in the hair, and to stop static and frizz.\nDepending on the hair type, repeated use of hair straighteners, like most other heat styling tools, can cause varying amounts of damage such as split ends, thinning of the hair shaft and even causing hair to become brittle and prone to breakage. Generally, after extensive damage, hair will show signs of dryness and display an unhealthy appearance. However, many companies, such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Tresemm\u00e9, have began to manufacture heat protection sprays and cream which aim to reduce the amount of damage that is caused by the use of straighteners.\nHair straighteners should only be used on dry hair, unless they are specially made with vents to let the moisture out. These sort of irons are usually called \"Wet Dry\" irons.\nBased on the materials used in the heating plates, hair irons can be classified as ceramic, tourmaline and traditional metal flat iron. Ceramic hair irons are believed to be gentle to the hair.\nHow it works.\nHair straighteners work by breaking the hair's hydrogen bonds, which are part of what make the hair curly. After the bonds are broken, the hair is stopped from going back to its original, natural, curly form. The hydrogen bonds can re-form if moisture touches them, such as water or dampness."}

An important prehistoric Neolithic culture marked by Megalithic structures was on the islands, which were made a thousand years before the Pyramids of Giza, which means they were very old. The Phoenicians in the Mediterranean took over Malta from about 1000 BC, using the islands to expand their sea explorations and trade in the Mediterranean, until the Carthaginians took over and also expanded in the Mediterranean, but these were also defeated by the Romans in 216 BC.\nMalta was then ruled by Byzantine, a Greek group that took over almost all of the Mediterranean, from the 4th to 9th century. Sometime around this point, the Vandals, a German tribe, ruled the islands. The islands were at one point invaded by the Arabs in AD 870. They allowed the people to believe in Christianity, and did not have children with the population, so they did not change much on the island, but they showed them citrus fruits and cotton, and water-moving systems. They hardly had any effect on the island or its people while they were there, but one thing that they did effect was the language. The Maltese language gained a lot from this.\nFrom the advent of the Normans in 1090 to 1530, Malta was part of the 'Kingdom of Sicily'. This means that from 1091 to 1530, when the Order of St. John came to Malta, the original Sicilian population that moved there from Sicily in the beginning got bigger.\nThe French under the rule of Napoleon took over Malta in 1798. The British helped the Maltese to stop the French control two years later. The people of Malta were very happy that the British did this, and wanted Britain to rule it. As part of the 'Treaty of Paris' (1814), Malta became a colony in the British Empire.\nMalta became a separate country from everyone on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day). Under the 1964 rules, Malta originally kept Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Malta, with a Governor-General working on her behalf in Malta. On 13 December 1974 (Republic Day), it became a republic within the Commonwealth, with the President as head of state. Malta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and joined the Eurozone on 1 January 2008.\nPossible genetic links.\nThe origins debate.\nMalta\nHistorians and Geneticists currently do not know where the Maltese people came from. The answer is difficult to find because of several things, such as Malta's invasions, with long parts in time where the population got smaller, before other people from the Mediterranean moved to Malta and married the Maltese. One unusual example of this is the exile to Malta of all of the male population from the town of Celano (Italy) in 1223, the stationing of a Norman and Sicilian garrison on Malta in 1240, the expulsion from Malta of Arabs (presumably, those who refused to convert to Christianity) commencing in 1245, the arrival of several hundred Catalan soldiers in 1283, the European repopulation of Malta that began in the 13th century,\nthe settlement in Malta of noble families from Sicily and Aragon between 1372 and 1450, the arrival of several thousand Greek and Rhodian sailors, soldiers and slaves with the Knights of St. John, the introduction of several thousand Sicilian labourers in 1551 and again in 1566, the emigration to Malta of some 891 Italian exiles during the Risorgimento in 1849, and the posting of some 22,000 British servicemen in Malta from 1807 to 1979.\nHistorical and ethnic studies published and promoted by the various ruling classes during their governance over Malta provide little, if any, valuable guidance on the question of Maltese ethnicity, given that their conclusions appear to have been driven, in large part, by political expediency. Hence, Maltese history books published during the rule of the Knights of St. John, at a time when Malta and Gozo suffered repeated \"razzias\" at the hands of the Ottomans and Barbary corsairs, promoted the myth of a continuous, Roman Catholic, native Maltese population, that somehow survived despite the Arab conquest of Malta and the depopulation that followed. Studies and reports published during the British colonial period promoted the theory of Phoenician origins, in an attempt to distinguish the Maltese from their Sicilian and Italian neighbours, or in the case of the Catholic Church, to distinguish the Maltese from the Arab peoples that controlled Malta prior to the liberation of Malta by the Normans. By contrast, history books published during the Mintoff years following Independence began to question the earlier beliefs in a continuous, indigenous population of Christian Maltese and, in some cases, quietly promoted the theory of closer cultural and ethnic ties with North Africa. This new development was noted by Boissevain in 1991:\n\"...the Labour government broke off relations with NATO and sought links with the Arab world. After 900 years of being linked to Europe, Malta began to look southward. Muslims, still remembered in folklore for savage pirate attacks, were redefined as blood brothers.\"\nThis latter development coincided with and reflected dramatic new (but short-lived) developments in Maltese foreign policy: Western media reported that Malta appeared to be turning its back on NATO, the United Kingdom, and Europe generally; Libya had loaned several million dollars to Malta to make up for the loss of rental income which followed the closure of British military bases in Malta; Malta and Libya had entered into a \"Friendship and Cooperation Treaty\", in response to repeated overtures by Gaddafi for a closer, more formal union between the two countries.\nThe Phoenician origins theory.\nSome recent studies carried out by geneticists Spencer Wells and Pierre Zalloua of the American University of Beirut collected samples of Y-chromosomes from men living in the Middle East, North Africa, southern Spain, and Malta, places the Phoenicians are known to have settled and traded. According to the study, more than half (50%) of the Y chromosome lineages that are seen in today's Maltese population could have come in with the Phoenicians. As to why there is such a significant genetic impact, Wells could only speculate, \"but the results are consistent with a settlement of people from the Levant within the past 2,000 years, and that points to the Phoenicians.\" \nThe Phoenician background of the Maltese suggests possible tenuous cultural, religious, and linguistic links to Lebanese Maronites, (whom are also descended from Phoenicians revealed during National Geographic's Special), who speak a variety of Arabic, and are Christian. .\nThe Sicilian or Calabrian theory.\nThis \"Phoenician origins\" theory has been contradicted by at least one major study, which found that \"the contemporary males of Malta most likely originated from Southern Italy, including Sicily and up to Calabria,\" and that \"[t]here is a minuscule amount of input from the Eastern Mediterranean with genetic affinity to Christian Lebanon.\" One of the authors of this study commented as follows on the Wells/Zalloua study:\n\"We are aware of conflicting conclusions published as an interview in the popular National Geographic magazine. Despite an intensive search we cannot find them reproduced in the mainstream scientific literature. We consider that data somewhat flawed, and furthermore, unsound. National Geographic is not a peer-reviewed academic journal and thus the weight of the evidence is poor compared to other peer-reviewed academic journals that are also in the public domain. One cannot be comfortable with data that have not passed the scrutiny of peer review...\"\n\"[I]t seems to me that the simplest explanation that cannot be excluded by any of the scientific data thus far available is that Malta was indeed barely inhabited at the turn of the tenth century.\"\n\"Repopulation is likely to have occurred by a clan or clans (possibly of Arab or Arab-like speaking people) from neighbouring Sicily and Calabria. Possibly, they could have mixed with minute numbers of residual inhabitants, with a constant input of immigrants from neighbouring countries and later, even from afar. There seems to be little input from North Africa.\""}

{"id": "86394", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86394", "title": "Dattatreya", "text": "Dattatreya is the God who is an incarnation of the Divine Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. The word Datta means \"Given\", Datta is called so because the divine trinity have \"given\" themselves in the form of a son to the sage couple Guru Atri and Mata Anusuya. He is the son of Guru Atri, hence the name \"Atreya.\"\nIn the Nath tradition, Dattatreya is seen as an Avatar or incarnation of the Lord Shiva and as the Adi-Guru (First Teacher) of the Adi-Nath sampradaya of the Nathas. Although Dattatreya was at first a \"Lord of Yoga\" with Tantric traits, he was adapted and assimilated into the more devotional cults; while still worshiped by millions of Hindus, he is approached more as a benevolent God than as a teacher of the highest essence of Indian thought.\nDattatreya as a historical figure.\nThough the Dattatreya of the Natha tradition coexisted and intermingled with the Puranic, Brahmanical tradition of the Datta sampradaya, here we shall focus almost exclusively on the earlier Tantric manifestation of Datta. Shri Gurudev Mahendranath had no doubt that Dattatreya was an historical figure. He stated that Datta was born on Wednesday, the fourteenth day of the full moon in the month of Margasirsa, though he does not mention the year.\nDattatreya left home at an early age to wander naked in search of the Absolute. He seems to have spent most of his life wandering in the area between and including North Mysore, through the Maharashtra, and into Gujarat as far as the Narmada River. He attained realization at a place not far from the town now known as Ganagapur. The original footprints of Datta are believed to be located on the lonely peak at Mount Girnar. The \"Tripura-rahasya\" refers to the disciple Parasurama finding Datta meditating on Gandhamadana mountain.\nThe \"Tripura-rahasya (The Secret of [the Goddess] Tripura)\" is believed to be an abbreviated version of the original \"Datta Samhita\" or \"Dakshinamurti Samhita\" traditionally ascribed to Dattatreya. This more lengthy work was summarized by Dattatreya's disciple Parasurama, whose disciple, Sumedha Haritayana, scribed the text. Thus, this text is sometimes referred to as the \"Haritayana Samhita\".\nThe \"Tripura-rahasya\" is divided into three parts. The first part, the \"Mahatmya Khanda\" or section on the goddess is concerned with the origin, mantra and yantra of the Goddess Tripura, also known as Lalita or Lalita Tripurasundari. The \"Jnana Khanda\" or section on knowledge elaborates on the themes of consciousness, manifestation, and liberation. The last part, \"Charya Khanda\" or section on conduct, has been lost and some believe destroyed.\nAnother work, the \"Avadhuta Gita (Song of the Free)\" is a wonderful, compete compilation of the highest thought given to and recorded by two of Dattatreya's disciples, Swami and Kartika. Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) held it in high esteem. Originally a work of seven chapters, a spurious and misogynistic eighth chapter may be a later attempt to append sexual morality to the Natha tradition by a conservative ascetic. Some of the ideas in this Gita are however common to both Shaivite and Buddhist Tantras.\nThe \"Markandeya Purana\" reports that Dattatreya, to free himself of all attachments, dove into a lake where he stayed for many years. By doing so, he also hoped to evade an assembly of Munis who remained on the banks of the lake awaiting his return. Datta emerged from the water naked in the company of a beautiful woman. The text relates that he made love with her (maithuna), drank liquor, and enjoyed singing and music. In spite of this, the Munis did not abandon him, and Dattatraya, accompanied by his shakti, continued to engage in these practices and was meditated on by those longing for moksha.\nIn the \"Bhagavata Purana\" Dattatreya enumerates a list of his twenty-four gurus: earth, air, sky / ether, water, fire, sun, moon, python, pigeons, sea, moth, bee, bull elephant, bear, deer, fish, osprey, a child, a maiden, a courtesan, a blacksmith, serpent, spider, and wasp. The image of the Natha ranged from that of a siddha living in the woods with animals, to that of a frightening, even demonic, being.\nIn \"The Pathless Path to Immortality\", Shri Gurudev Mahendranath writes:\n\"Shri Dattatreya was a dropout of an earlier age than the period when Veda and Tantra merged to become one simple cult. It was men like Dattatreya who helped to make this possible. Three of his close disciples were kings, one an Asura and the other two both belonging to the warrior caste. Dattatreya himself was regarded as an avatar of Maheshwara (Shiva) but later was claimed by Vaishnavites as the avatar of Vishnu. Not such a sectarian claim as it appears; Hindus regard Shiva and Vishnu as the same or as manifestations of the Absolute taking form.\"\nIndeed, the \"Dattatreya Upanisad\", which opens proclaiming Dattatreya's identity with Vishnu, ends with the mantra \"Om Namah Shivaya\", identifying Datta with Shiva. In the last portion of the third chapter, Mahesvara (Shiva) alone is said to pervade reality and shine in every heart of man. He alone is in front, behind, to the left, to the right, below, above, everywhere the center. Finally, Mahesvara is identified with Dattatreya, depicting the latter as an Avatar of Shiva.\nDattatreya as a devotional deity.\nDattatreya is usually depicted with three heads, symbolising Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva; past, present, and future; and the three states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. He is portrayed sitting in meditation with his shakti beneath the \"audumbara\" (wish-fulfilling) tree. In front of him is a fire pit, and around him are four dogs. These are sometimes said to symbolise the four Vedas."}

In 1904 he arrived in the capital St Petersburg. The Tsar and Tsarina talked many times with Rasputin and asked for advice as he became their spiritual guide.\nRasputin had a lot of influence over Tsarina Alexandra, the wife of Tsar Nicholas II, the emperor of Imperial Russia. Alexandra believed that Rasputin was the answer to her worries. Her only son, Tsarevich Alexei, the heir to the throne was very sick. He had hemophilia. It caused heavy bleeding and pain in his groin and legs each time he fell. Rasputin calmed the boy and the parents. From then on, Alexandra believed Rasputin was the only person who could heal her son with his prayers.\nBecause of this, the Tsar and his family began to trust Rasputin more with important decisions on politics. Rasputin did not support the Tsar when he decided to lead his country into World War I. In July 1914, during a stay in his home village, he was stabbed in his belly by a female conspirator Khioniya Guseva. After seven weeks, Rasputin recovered and went back to the capital. There he lived with his two daughters, who went to school in the capital. \nIn August 1915, the Tsar decided to lead the country's army himself, and replace his cousin Grand Duke Nikolai. Almost nobody supported him, except Alexandra and Rasputin. Many Russian politicians and nobles became very worried about Rasputin's influence. While the Tsar was at the front, Alexandra and Rasputin took many bad decisions. They proposed to the Tsar, extremely shy and weak-willed, the replacement of several ministers with ones that supported peace. At the end of 1916, Imperial Russia was in a chaotic state. In the big cities there was almost nothing to eat or heat. All the trains were used to supply the army. Some politicians in the parliament decided to attack Alexandra and Rasputin. Their goal was to go on with the war, even though there were heavy losses and a lack of weapons and ammunition.\nIn the night of 30 December 1916, Rasputin was led into the Yusupov palace's basement. He was offered wine. When he got drunk, he was shot twice by Prince Felix Yusupov. One shot went into his right kidney and then into his spine. He climbed some stairs and staggered out of the palace through a back door. Rasputin was shot again in the courtyard. To be sure he was dead, he was shot in the forehead at close range. (Nobody knows who fired that shot.) Grand Duke Dmitri drove the conspirators to the Neva River. There they dropped his body from the bridge. In the meantime, Prince Felix had killed his favorite dog, to cover the blood in the courtyard. A few days later Rasputin's body, completely frozen, was found stuck in the ice. The next day the corpse was buried in a park next to the Alexander Palace. After the February Revolution, the new leaders decided to dig up his body to prevent it from becoming a place of worship; and eventually burned it."}

Many famous people, such as Sir Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman were among those who made it. Stonewall is in London. Stonewall Scotland has offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow and Stonewall Cymru is based in both Cardiff and Bangor in North Wales.\nStonewall showed ideas for change to the government. It did not start out as a membership organisation. Since Labour came into power in 1997, however, it has now become active in developing policy (political ideas) to protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\nResults.\nSome of Stonewall's best known early work was backing legal test cases in the European Court of Human Rights. These included:\nIn the last few years it was successful in parliamentary lobbying. Its previous director Angela Mason (1992 to 2002) was awarded an OBE \"for services to homosexual rights\". Under her direction, Stonewall persuaded parliament to change the 2002 Adoption and Children Bill so that lesbian and gay couples were treated the same as heterosexuals. Under its current Chief Executive, Ben Summerskill, it was closely involved in successful parliamentary campaigns to repeal Section 28 of the Local Government Act (2003); make attacks on gay people separate crimes (that is, \"anti-gay hate crimes\"), through the Criminal Justice Act 2003; introduce the Civil Partnership Act 2004 giving gay and lesbian couples \"civil union\" almost the same as a civil marriage; and introduce the \"2007 Sexual Orientation Regulations\" under the Equality Act 2006, to stop discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.\nStonewall helps 300 big employers across Britain by giving advice and support to lesbian and gay staff. These companies include IBM, Credit Suisse, the Inland Revenue and the Royal Navy. \nThe \"Education for All\" campaign was started in 2005. Stonewall and 70 other organsiations help to stop homophobic bullying in British schools. Section 28 of the Local government Act made any sort of teaching about homosexuality difficult, and the Education for All campaign started after section 28 was repealed.\nCriticism.\nGrass-roots activists such as Peter Tatchell have accused Stonewall of allowing discrimination by holding regular meetings of celebrities and politicians. The meetings were supported by big businesses such as HSBC, even though HSBC is accused of dismissing someone because of their sexual orientation. \nStonewall supported the Civil Partnership bill. Many other groups did not, and they formed a group called the \"Coalition for Marriage Equality\", saying that the new Civil Partnership Bill made a separate yet equal system \"not unlike apartheid\". Many LGBT people who were not part of these groups liked the bill, and Stonewall got a lot of new members. Now Stonewall gets more money from its 10,000 individual supporters than it does money from its business supporters."}

He spent the winters in Florida until the death of his first wife in 1949. He retired in Florida. \nCabell was born into a rich Virginian family. His father, Robert Gamble Cabell II (1847\u20131922), was a physician. His mother, Anne Harris (1859\u20131915), was the daughter of Col. and Mrs James R. Branch. Cabell's great-grandfather, William H. Cabell, was Governor of Virginia from 1805 to 1808. Cabell was the oldest of three boys . His brothers were Robert Gamble Cabell III (1881\u20131968) and John Lottier Cabell (1883\u20131946). His parents separated and were later divorced in 1907.\nHe went to the College of William and Mary in 1894 at the age of fifteen. He graduated in 1898. While an undergraduate, Cabell taught French and Greek at the college. Ellen Glasgow, a writer and close friend of Cabell said that he had a friendship with a professor at the college which some people thought was \"too intimate\". Because of this, Cabell had to leave the college. He was later allowed back and finished his degree.\nCabell worked from 1898 to 1900 as a newspaper reporter in New York City. He returned to Richmond in 1901. In Richmond, he worked several months for the \"Richmond News\". \nMany things happened to Cabell in 1901. His first stories were accepted for publication. It was believed for a short time that Cabell murdered John Scott, a rich person in Richmond. There was a rumor that Scott was \"involved\" with Cabell's mother.\nIn 1902, seven of his stories appeared in national magazines. Over the ten years, he wrote many short stories and articles. These were published in well-known magazines including \"Harper's Monthly Magazine\" and the \"Saturday Evening Post\".\nBetween 1911 and 1913, he worked for his uncle in the office of the Branch coal mines in West Virginia. On November 8, 1913, he married Priscilla Bradley Shepherd. She was a widow with five children from an earlier marriage. In 1915, Priscilla gave birth to a son, Ballard Hartwell Cabell. Priscilla died in March of 1949. In June 1950, Cabell married Margaret Waller Freeman.\nDuring his life, Cabell published fifty-two books. These included novels, genealogy, collections of short stories, poetry, and miscellanea. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. Today, the modern languages house and an endowed law professorship at the College of William and Mary are named for him. \nCabell died of a cerebral hemorrhage. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. \nIn 1970, Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond named its main campus library \"James Branch Cabell Library\". In the 1970s, Cabell's library and personal papers were moved from his home on Monument Avenue to the James Branch Cabell Library. The collection includes some 3,000 volumes, manuscripts, notebooks and scrapbooks, periodicals, letters (including conversations with noted writers such as H.L. Mencken, Ellen Glasgow, Sinclair Lewis and Theodore Dreiser), newspaper clippings, photographs, criticisms, printed material, publishers' agreements and statements of sales. \nThe VCU undergraduate literary journal at the university is named Poictesme after the fictional province in his book \"Jurgen\".\nWorks.\nCabell published about fifty books. Most of these are not well known. His eighth book, \"Jurgen\", (1919) was the most popular. The hero, Jurgen, goes on a journey through ever more fantastic places. He even goes to hell and heaven. Everywhere he goes, he seduces the local women, even the Devil's wife. \nThe book was seen as being bad by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. They tried to bring a prosecution for obscenity. The case went on for two years before Cabell and his publishers won. Many of the things in the book were double entendres. They had one meaning which was bad and also had a decent meaning. It appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was a joke about papal infallibility. Cabell took an author's revenge. The new edition of 1926 included a 'lost' section which was not in the earlier version. In it, the hero is put on trial by the Philistines. A large dung beetle is the chief prosecutor.\nOther works include \"Figures of Earth\". This introduces Manuel the Redeemer. He took control of a realm by playing on others' expectations. His motto is \"Mundus Vult Decipi\". This means 'the world wishes to be deceived'. \"The Silver Stallion\" is a sequel. It deals with the adventures of the knights in Manuel's company after he left them. \nCabell is now forgotten by most people but his work affected later writers of fantasy fiction. Robert Heinlein's \"Job, A comedy of Justice\" has an appearance of the Slavic god Koschei (from \"Jurgen\"). Fritz Leiber's \"Swords of Lankhmar\" was also affected by Jurgen. Jack Vance's \"Dying Earth\" books show a similar style to Cabell's writing. Cugel the Clever in those books is very similar to Jurgen."}

He is called Master Lu by his followers. Within his sect, he is also known as \"Living Buddha Lian Sheng\" (\u84ee\u751f\u6d3b\u4f5b, \"Liansheng Hu\u00f3f\u00f3\"). He is worshipped by his followers as a \"Living Buddha\".\nHis organization says that over five million students have taken Buddhist refuge under Lu. There are also more than three hundred local chapters of the True Buddha School, including thirty major temples, such as the Ling Shen Ching Tze Temple in Redmond, Washington, where he lives now. Many of his followers are from Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.\nLu is married to Lian Hsiang, who is also a vajra master. She is referred as \"Grand Madam Lu\". Lu and Lian Hsiang have two children.\nLife.\nLu was born in Chiayi County, Taiwan in 1945. He was raised a Christian and attended a Protestant school. His post-secondary education was at Chung Cheng Institute of Technology. He graduated with a degree in Survey Engineering. In his early twenties he was both a survey engineer and a Sunday school Bible teacher.\nLu has written that he had a mystical experience in 1969. This lead him to seek out a total of twenty-one human gurus in Taoism, Sutra, and Tantra. In 1982, Lu moved to the United States, and lived in the state of Washington.\nTo date, Lu has written over 200 books in Chinese on various topics, including feng shui and poetry.\nAccording to his website, he went into hiding in Tahiti for six years starting late 2000 and lived in Taichung, Taiwan. Today he lives in the state of Washington.\nTeachings.\nLu teaches the Mahamudra way of attaining enlightenment. His teachings follow the traditional stages of the practice of the Four Preliminaries, followed by Guru Yoga, Deity Yoga, the Vajra Practices, and finally Highest Yoga Tantra. Lu has written that his spiritual gurus included the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje and Tai Situ Rinpoche.\nHe describes the state of enlightenment using the allegory of Padmakumara, whom he identifies with Amitabha Buddha and his own enlightened self.\nAccording to Noah Casey, Lu's teachings do not prohibit the consumption of meat and alcohol; however, \"The consumption of alcohol is limited to quantities not resulting in intoxication, and the eating of meat is restricted to animals not butchered especially for the person consuming. Before consuming either of these, or any other nutritional substance, a special prayer is required. For meats, the spirit of the animal must be delivered.\" This is consistent with the Vajrayana traditions of Tibetan Buddhism.\nControversies.\nLu made headlines during an investigation by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission into his cash donations to Chinese American politician Gary Locke, who Lu had hoped would run for President of the United States. Locke was cleared of any wrongdoing by the commission in 1998.\nHe was also sued in civil court by a former disciple, who called herself SHC, a 41-year-old Malaysian immigrant, over claims of sexual misconduct, after the King County, Washington prosecutor declined to file charges for lack of evidence. The case was dismissed by King County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Learned citing constitutional issues. In the case \"S.H.C. v. Sheng-Yen Lu\", the Superior Court of King County granted the Temple's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals later \"affirm[ed] the trial court's grant of summary judgment dismissing all claims against the Temple.\"\nLu has been criticized by Tsering Phuri, the president of TIBETcenter, who said \"People should not say, `I am a living Buddha'\".\nHowever, this title was called by his diciples or people who believed in him back to 30 or 40 years ago in Taiwan, and Lu also admitted that he is the incarnated body of the Buddha."}

He was one of the most important composers of his time. He went to Italy when he was young and spent the rest of his life there. He belonged to the group of composers who lived and worked in Venice at the time, and who were known as the \u201cVenetian School\u201d.\nLife.\nHe may have been born in Bruges which is now in Belgium, although we are not sure. One of his students, Gioseffo Zarlino, who became a well-known music theorist, said that Willaert went to Paris first to study law, but then decided to study music. In Paris he met Jean Mouton, the main composer of the French royal chapel, and studied with him. Mouton taught him to write music in the style of Josquin, whose music was very polyphonic with the voices imitating one another a lot.\nSometime around 1515 Willaert first went to Rome. There is a story, which is probably true, that Willaert was surprised to find the Pope\u2019s choir singing something he had composed. The choir thought it had been composed by Josquin, who was very famous by then. When the young Willaert told them that he himself was the composer, the choir did not believe the young man, and refused to sing it again.\nIn July 1515, Willaert worked for the Cardinal Ippolito I d'Este of Ferrara. Ippolito liked to travel, and he often took Willaert and other musicians with him to places such as Hungary, where he probably spent two years, from 1517 to 1519. When Ippolito died in 1520, Willaert worked for Duke Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara. In 1522 Willaert had a job at the court chapel of Duke Alfonso; he stayed there until 1525.\nWillaert then got the most important musical job in the whole of Europe at that time: he became maestro di cappella (director of music) at the church of St. Mark's at Venice. The director who had been there before had not been very good, so Willaert made the music in that church really great again. He stayed in that job until his death. He was very famous and young composers came from all over Europe to study with him and learn how to be a composer.\nMusical style and influence.\nWillaert was one of the greatest composers of the Renaissance and the most important composer in Europe between the death of Josquin and the time of Palestrina.\nHe wrote music in lots of forms, especially church music, madrigals and instrumental pieces called ricercar."}

It is the location of the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nHistory.\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, the area surrounding Sydney Harbour was home to a variety of aboriginal tribes, including members of the Gadigal, Cammeraygal, Eora and Wanegal tribes. It is believed (source?) that the Gadigal people once lived in the area heading from the south side of Port Jackson (South Head, Watsons Bay) and west in a semi circle through Petersham. The Cammeraygal tribe lived on the northern side of Sydney Harbour and the Wanegal tribe owned the area on the southern side of the Parramatta River, just west of Petersham and through to Rose Hill. The Eora tribe lived on the southern side of Sydney Harbour, not far from where the First Fleet set up camp.\nIn 1770, shortly after he left Botany Bay (), Lt James Cook became the first non-Aboriginal person to visit Sydney Harbour. Cook named it [Sydney Harbour] after Sir George Jackson. He did not go into the harbour, but sailed past the entrance (Sydney Heads) on his way north up the East Coast of Australia. \nEuropean settlement started on January 26, 1788 when Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet arrived from England. Phillip brought 732 convicts (prisoners) and a small group of soldiers to start a penal colony. They landed at a small inlet which they called Sydney Cove after Lord Sydney, who was the British government's Home Secretary.\nIslands.\nThere are lots of islands inside Sydney Harbour, including Shark Island, Clark Island, Fort Denison, Goat Island, Cockatoo Island, Spectacle Island, Snapper Island and Rodd Island. Some other former islands, including Bennelong Island, Garden Island and Berry Island are now connected to the mainland by bridge or by landfill. There are several islands only accessible by boat, for example Fort Denison and Cockatoo Island. Boat hire operators offer charter trips or self-drive options to these locations. "}

It was released on September 12, 2006. The album is named after a song on the album; a cover of a song by American singer Tom Brosseau.\nThe album got mostly good reviews from important music critics, with some critics saying that the album was \u201c{fantastic, eclectic\u201d, and \u201cgenius\u201d. The album got Thile a Grammy Award-nomination in 2007.\nEarly planning and creation.\nFor a side project away from his band Nickel Creek, Chris Thile knew he wanted to form a five-piece string band that featured mandolin, violin, banjo, acoustic guitar, and double bass. Thile also wanted the band to feature his friend and fiddle player Gabe Witcher, but didn\u2019t know what kind of band he wanted it to be. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado, Thile met banjo player Noam Pikelny and later said that \u201cevery note he played was something I wish I\u2019d played\u201d. At that time, Thile decided that he wanted \u201cput [his] stamp\u201d on the normal bluegrass band. Thile wanted to find five people to make the five-piece band he planned. He had already found fiddle, banjo, and mandolin players, so he just had to find double bass and acoustic guitar players. The bass player Thile was looking for turned out to be Greg Garrison, a friend of Noam Pikelny. Before this, Pikelny had played with Garrison in the band Leftover Salmon. The guitar player Thile needed became Chris Eldridge, famous as a member of the Infamous Stringdusters. The five people met up in Nashville on one day in 2005 and decided to \u201cdo something musical together\u201d. A few days later, the group met again \u201cto drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and [talk] about our failed relationships\u201d. That night, they formed a bluegrass band.\nA few months later, the group decided to record an album. The album was recorded in two days at \"Sear Sound Recording Studios\" in New York City. The album was not made digitally, but in the old-fashioned way: on tape. In an interview with the United States magazine \"Guitar Player\", Chris Thile talked about how \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" was recorded: \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" was produced by Thile, and the only musicians on the album was the band that Thile chose. The band was later named the \"How to Grow a Band\".\nMusical style.\n\"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" takes influence from several musical genres, \u201cdrawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer-songwriter traditions\u201d. One music critic called the album \u201croots oriented\u201d. Bluegrass mandolin player Ronnie McCoury became the album\u2019s official \u201cbluegrass guru\u201d to make sure that there was \u201csomeone who could make sure we didn\u2019t do anything clich\u00e9d or trite\u201d. When discussing the album\u2019s musical style, Chris Thile said that \u201cAll in all, \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me.\u201d Much of Thile's work on the album was inspired by his divorce, and Thile said that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he \"got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. I\u2019ve always been able to talk to girls, but I\u2019m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems.\" "}

Hofmann wrote more than 100 scientific articles and a number of books, including \"LSD: My Problem Child\" (1979).\nLife.\nHofmann was born in Baden, Switzerland. He studied chemistry at the University of Z\u00fcrich. His main interest was the chemistry of plants and animals, and he studied about the chemical structure of the common animal substance chitin. Hofmann worked at the pharmaceutical-chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories in Basel.\nFive years after its first synthesis, he discovered by accident the psychedelic effects of LSD, after absorbing some through his fingertips on April 16 1943. Three days later, he deliberately consumed 250 micrograms of LSD, and experienced far more intense effects. This was followed by a series of self-experiments. He first wrote about these experiments on April 22 of the same year.\nHe became director of the natural products department at Sandoz and went on studying hallucinogenic substances found in Mexican mushrooms and other plants used by the indigenous peoples. This led to the synthesis of psilocybin, the active agent of many magic mushrooms.\nHofmann called LSD \"medicine for the soul\".\nHe had a heart attack in his home in Burg im Leimental on April 29, 2008, and died at the age of 102."}

He later wrote a memoir, \"John Lennon \"In My Life\"\", that was later retitled \"The Beatles, Lennon and Me\".\nEarly life.\nShotton and Lennon met as boys, in their hometown of Woolton, England. Woolton is a suburb of Liverpool. The two fought at first, but soon became best friends. They went to school together, and often got into trouble together. They formed a \"gang\", with other boys who lived nearby.\nDuring their teenage years, rock and roll became popular in England, as it did in America. Folk music and were also popular. Young people all over England formed skiffle bands, and played folk and rock songs. Lennon got a guitar from his mother. He and Shotton formed a band, the Quarry Men, with classmates from their school (named Quarry Bank), and other friends.\nShotton's role in the band was to play percussion on a , and to sing harmony. While Lennon had genuine musical talent, Shotton did not become a skilled musician, and did not enjoy playing music. After Paul McCartney joined the Quarry Men, he and Lennon began to work together on music. McCartney was very talented, and Shotton felt out of place in the band. He waited a long time, before he finally told Lennon.\nLennon \"fired\" Shotton from the Quarry Men after they played at a party. He took the washboard away and broke it over Shotton's head. All the same, they were still friends, and spent time together. When they finished high school, Lennon went on to art college, and Shotton trained to become a police officer. The Quarry Men changed from playing skiffle to playing rock and roll. They also changed names a few times, before calling themselves the Beatles.\nThe Beatles.\nWhen Lennon became famous with the Beatles, he invited Shotton to visit at different times. He and George Harrison, another band member, bought a supermarket with part of their , and made Shotton its manager. Shotton married and had a son. He spent most of the week with his family, but would visit Lennon's home on weekends. Lennon counted on Shotton to be a real friend, who was not only around because Lennon was famous or rich. Shotton and Lennon's wife Cynthia got along well, and Shotton sometimes took Cynthia out for the evening, when Lennon needed to work on music.\nShotton also helped now and then with the Beatles's music. He sometimes helped or ideas for songs, or played or other percussion instruments on their recordings. Later, when the Beatles started their own company, Apple Corps, Shotton became its first managing director.\nApple Corps was not a successful company, and it caused problems between the Beatles, and with the people who worked with them. The problems were not Shotton's fault, but he felt as much pressure and stress as anyone. He resigned his job at Apple. Lennon tried Shotton out as a , but this did not go well. Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono also caused problems between Lennon and Shotton.\nShotton decided it was best to part ways with Lennon, while their friendship was still strong. He went back to running his supermarket, and he and Lennon lost touch. After Lennon and Yoko Ono moved to America, Shotton visited them in New York City, and they enjoyed seeing each other again.\nLater life.\nJohn Lennon was murdered late in 1980. When Shotton heard the news, he drove to George Harrison's home, Friar Park, and spent the day with Harrison. Later he wrote his memoir.\nShotton gave up his supermarket, and began a chain of restaurants, Fatty Arbuckle's, which became a success. He later sold this business, and retired to live in Ireland. When former members of Lennon's Quarry Men re-formed in the 1990s as a nostalgia act, Shotton performed with them. He later sang \"Imagine\" at a tribute to Lennon and the Beatles in Woolton.\nDeath.\nShotton died on 24 March 2017 in Knutsford, Cheshire from a suspected heart attack. aged 75."}

Both are chemosensory senses. They change chemical signals into nerve impulses, which are translated into perceptions in the brain.\nThe part of the brain which deals with olfaction is the rhinencephalon, a small part in the human brain, but much more important in other vertebrates. The piriform cortex is probably the area most closely associated with identifying the odor. The medial amygdala is involved in social functions such as mating and recognising animals of the same species. The entorhinal cortex pairs odors with memories. The exact functions of these higher areas is still being researched. \nLinda B. Buck and Richard Axel won the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the olfactory system. By analyzing rat DNA, they estimated that there were about one thousand different genes for olfactory receptors in the mammalian genome. \nDamage.\nDamage to the olfactory system can happen through brain injury, cancer or toxic gases. The damage is usually measured by doctors giving the patient something to smell and having the patient try to guess what it is."}

When it was agreed that Charles would return, Richard thought it would be best for him to leave Britain, and he went to live in France for a while.

He was Flemish, but spent all his adult life in Italy. The name de Rore is a proper Flemish name, not a name that has been changed to look Italian. He was one of the most important composer of madrigals in the 16th century.\nLife.\nThere is very little known about Rore's early life. He was born in a small town called Ronse (Renaix) in what is now Belgium. It is possible that he had music lessons in Antwerp. We think that he was taken to Italy by Margaret of Parma in 1533 as one of her servants. Margaret, who was an illegitimate daughter of Charles V, was very wealthy and she married into the Medici family. Rore probably continued to learn about music in Italy.\nIn his music publications de Rore is called a \u201cdisciple\u201d of Adrian Willaert. We do not know whether this means that he had lessons from Willaert, or just that he learned to compose by studying Willaert\u2019s music. His first book of madrigals was published in 1542, and then two books of motets were published.\nIn 1546 Rore went to Ferrara, where he was \"maestro di cappella\" (choirmaster) He wrote a great deal of music in Ferrara. He worked for the Duke Ercole II d'Este. He composed masses, motets, chansons, and lots of madrigals, some of which were about things that happened in the court at Ferrara. The duke awarded him an important honour. Rore also wrote music for Albrecht V of Bavaria who lived in Munich.\nHe left his job in Ferrara and went back to Flanders where he found his home town Ronse had been destroyed in a war. He went back to Ferrara, but could not get his old job back. After another visit to Flanders he returned to Italy and got a job in Parma, but the music in that town was not very good. For a short time he had a very important job of\n\"maestro di cappella\" at St. Mark's. Adrian Willaert had just died. However, Rore only kept this job for a year, returning to Parma in 1564 and dying there the next year.\nWorks and influence.\nRore is best known for his Italian madrigals, but he also wrote a lot of church music, including masses and motets. He learned from studying the music of Josquin. His madrigals are based on the style of Willaert. He enjoyed writing thick counterpoint and making the voices imitate one another a lot. Most of the words he set were serious words, not lighthearted and amusing. He often used chromaticism. He developed his musical style a lot during his lifetime. His music was very important in the development of the Italian madrigal, and it led the way to the madrigals of Monteverdi."}

TFT technology can be used to give one of the clearest pictures of any flat screen display and it uses much less electricity than older screens. TFT displays are very fragile because they are made as thin and light as possible but this means they need far less space. Widescreen Displays (which have an aspect ratio of 16:9) are becoming the most popular form of television and monitor displays. Standard format (which have an aspect ratio of 4:3) was the most popular for a long time.\nResolution.\nThe number of pixels in a display screen is called the resolution.\nThe word resolution means the solution of a problem. Better resolution on a display screen describes how detailed a picture can be displayed. Each pixel is another detail on the screen. This is normally described as two numbers, (width) x (height).\nhan thpe older CRT displays.\nTFT dislays are also known as flatscreen, flat-panel, and liquid crystal display (LCD) but these types are not always TFTs.\nTFT displays are made with a special chemical technology called chemical vapor deposition. With this special technology very thin glass can be coated with electrically metal and still be transparent. Chemical vapor deposition makes the thinnest computer and television display screens possible. \nAs a result of applying this solution, a capacitor with a transistor is fixed to the pixels. Therefore, it is possible to create the necessary contrast. Among the minuses: poor viewing angle, impaired color rendering, increased power consumption. This technology has not yet been discontinued just because it is in high demand among consumers due to its affordable cost. \nRendering.\nMost display screens have hundreds of thousands of pixels. Each pixel has to be set to the right colour (most display screens are capable of 16 million colours in each pixel). To make a clear picture, the screen might need to make millions of calculations. Any group of pixels that change to the same colour can be changed with one calculation, making the calculations much smaller. For example, if the picture to display was just a white screen, the screens processor would only calculate the colour once and use the same calculation for the whole screen. Changing one pixel at a time would take many more calculations. If the same picture was shown many times on the screen, the processor would calculate the picture once and then repeat it in whatever position and in different sizes, if needed. The processor can make very complicated calculations, but in the end it does less work. This is called rendering technology. Rendering technology in the most modern displays is like making a .\nA display with a resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels has four times the number of pixels in an 800 x 600 resolution. Without rendering technology the 1600 x 1200 display would do four times as much work as an 800 x 600 display so rendering technology is very useful to make a bigger display with some of the same parts used to make a smaller display.\nResponse Time.\nThe response time is the length of time it takes between the processor receiving a signal from the computer or the television station and displaying something on the screen. Today's displays have a very low response time (very fast). It is hard to see response times but they can affect a clear picture. A low response time is best for clear pictures when playing games and watching movies on the screen. For office work and internet a fast response time is less important.\nTFT response time is measured as the average time it takes to change the pixels from one shade of grey to another shade of grey.\nChanging a pixel between colours takes more time than changing from black to white on a display screen. TFT is very fast for changing between colours which is more important for movies and games.\nComparison of TFT displays and CRT displays.\nPositive aspects of TFT displays:\nNegative aspects of TFT displays\nAt one time, there were some positive advantages of CRT displays, which are no longer true:\nNegative aspects of CRT displays:\nTN panels.\nTN is an abbreviation for Twisted Nematic. This is a new kind of TFT technology. They offer higher resolutions (more pixels). TN panels have a lower response time (they react faster).\nFurther development.\nSince this article was written, there have been further developments in the technology of producing LCD displays.

People are usually said to have BDD if they are extremely critical of their body, even though there may be nothing noticeably wrong with it. If there is something wrong with their body, it is usually so small that a person without BDD would not be unhappy about it at all. People claim that they are insecure, but BDD is far worse.\nMost people without BDD may not like some parts of their body, but people with BDD believe that they are so ugly, even though they are not, that they find it difficult to talk or exist with other people, or live normally, scared that other people will be mean to them because of the way they look. People with BDD often do not look for help because they are afraid others will think they are just vain, or they may feel too embarrassed to talk to other people as they think they are so ugly.\nBDD is a somatoform disorder. People with BDD may look at themselves in the mirror too much, or some people with BDD may actually try not to look in the mirror. Both of these are possible for a person with BDD. They usually think about their body for more than one hour per day, and in bad cases, can stop talking to other people, and may stay at home. People with BDD often have very low self-confidence, because they believe that a person's value is linked to what they look like, and because they do not think that they are beautiful themselves, they do not think they have much value.\nHistory.\nSigmund Freud had an important Russian person (Sergei Pankejeff) with him in the past, who would have been classified as having the disorder in modern times. Freud named him \"The Wolf Man\", to protect Pankejeff's identity. Pankejeff was so unhappy with his nose that he could not live a normal life.\nCause.\nIt is unknown what the full cause of BDD is. However, research shows that a number of things may be the cause:\n\"The chemicals in the brain.\" If the amount of serotonin is too low, one of the brain's neurotransmitters which gives us 'mood' and 'pain', may help cause body dysmorphic disorder. Scientists can not explain this chemical problem in the brain, but it may be hereditary (passed down from parents to child).\n\"Obsessive-compulsive disorder.\" Many people with BDD also have OCD, where the person does things without wanting to. If people have had, or have a genetic link to OCD, the person may be more likely to have BDD.\n\"Generalized anxiety disorder.\" Many people with BDD also have generalized anxiety disorder. This disorder is where the person worries about things a lot, which makes them have anxiety about things in their life, for example, about their body, as in BDD.\nDevelopment.\nBDD usually develops in adolescence, a time when people usually worry about their appearance the most. However, many people with BDD suffer for years before they look for help. When they do look for help to Doctors, people with the problem often say they have other problems, for example, depression, social anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, but do not say their real problem is with the way they look. Most patients can not be convinced that the problem they have with their body is only 'imagined', and that they are seeing a 'changed' view of themselves, because people do not know much about BDD, compared to other mental problems, for example OCD or others.\nDiagnosis.\nThe DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) IV says that a person must have the things written below if they have BDD:\nFeatures of BDD.\nA person with BDD will often do these things:\nWhere on the body the 'imagined' problem can be.\nDr. Katharine Philips did research, with more than 500 people with BDD, on the percentage of patients unhappy with the most common parts of the body;\nsource: \"The Broken Mirror\", Katharine A Philips, Oxford University Press, 2005 ed, p56\nHowever, people with BDD often are unhappy about more than one part of their body.\nNumbers of people.\nA German study has shown that 1-2% of the population has complete BDD, but a bigger percentage of people show some of the effects (\"Psychological Medicine\", vol 36, p 877).\nThe number of men and women with BDD is around the same, but there are slightly more women with it. However, the number of men and women who go to the doctor with it are the same.\nStudies show that BDD is common non-clinical places and clinical places. Research was done on 200 people with DSM-IV BDD. These people were aged 12 and older. They were interviewed. The people with BDD were found from 'mental-health doctors', advertisements, their friends and family, and non-psychiatrist physicians. 53 of the 200 people were receiving medication, 33 were receiving psychotherapy, and 48 were receiving both medication and psychotherapy. How bad each person's BDD was, was assessed using the \"Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale\", modified for BDD. Symptoms were assessed with the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination. Both tests were made just for BDD. The results showed that BDD is in 0.7% - 1.1% of community samples and 2%-13% of non-clinical samples. 13% of psychiatric patients had BDD. Research also found that some of the patients who were firstly diagnosed with OCD, also had BDD. 53 patients with OCD and 53 patients with BDD were compared to each other in research. Clinical features, comorbidity, family history, and population features were compared between the two groups. 9 of the 62 subjects (14.5%) of those with OCD also had BDD.\nIn most examples, BDD is not found even when people have it. In research done on 17 patients with BDD, BDD was 'found' in only five patients, and none of the patients had a proper diagnosis of BDD even though they all in fact had BDD.\nProblems caused by BDD.\nBDD can cause only a few problems for some people. However, for other people, it can cause many problems.\nResponsibilities.\nIt can make it very difficult to have a normal job or family life. People who have a job or a family to care for would definitely find life easier and better if they did not have BDD. The love partners of BDD people can also suffer, as they may sometimes lose their loved one to suicide. Friendship, romance, and family is very hard to hold for a person with BDD, as the unhappiness with the looks of the person takes over their life, so they often do not bother with the other aspects of life as much. Also, the BDD stops the person from making these 'bonds' with people, as they always feel scared about the way they look, and therefore find it difficult to be themself with other people.\nMotivation.\nPeople with BDD may often have little motivation for anything. This means that BDD people can appear to take a long time to get everything done. However, this is not exactly true, because BDD sufferers will often just stop what they were doing for a long time, so it is not just that they are slow, but find it difficult to concentrate on what they are doing. without being able to actually motivate themselves until it becomes completely necessary to get back up. This low amount of motivation can be in all parts of a person's life, for example, school, friends, love, family, or work.\nHowever, when the person is trying to do things to the way they look, such as combing their hair, or choosing clothes, it is common for the person to have an extreme motivation. Therefore, people with BDD can sometimes not feel motivated for anything in their life, but when they are working on their looks, they will have an extreme motivation that is not normal either.\nSuicide.\nPeople with BDD have a very high suicide rate compared to all mental problems.\nPhillips &amp; Menard did a lot of research in 2006 about BDD suicides.\nSome people say that there is a link between undiagnosed BDD and a higher than average suicide rate with people who had cosmetic surgery.\nAnother condition, Gender identity disorder (GID), where the person finds his or her gender as a male or female uncomfortable, often has BDD-like feelings that are only directed at the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics on their body, which disagree with the person's perception of their own gender since birth. People with GID may also have BDD-like traits or their condition may be mis-diagnosed as BDD. Most studies reported a pre- transition GID suicide attempt rate of 20% or more. The suicide attempt rate for patients with BDD is 15%. No studies are available showing overlap between GID and BDD suicide rate because BDD is excluded as a condition prior to GID diagnosis.\nBDD and GID are different conditions. One of the key differences is the fact that BDD responds to psychopharmacology, whereas GID does not. Furthermore, psychopharmacology or psychotherapy are often successful in convincing the BDD sufferer that their perceptions are distorted. Those with GID are rarely convinced that they are mistaken. GID (especially \"transsexualism\") also often manifests during early childhood, rather than during adolescence. It is standard practice in treating BDD to convince sufferers that surgical procedures are not necessary because eradicating their first perceived defect through surgery will only make them start obsessing about their next perceived defect, whereas those people properly diagnosed as \"transsexual\" under GID benefit greatly from surgical procedures specifically targeted at their primary or secondary sex characteristics. However, a person with GID may also have BDD if they obsess over perceived defects on their body that contradict or go beyond their gender identity.\nVanity.\nBDD is often wrongly thought of as a 'vanity' obsession, but it is actually the opposite, because people with BDD believe they are very ugly, even though people without BDD do not think they are. There is not usually actually anything wrong with the way the person with BDD looks, but to that person, there is. A person with BDD can spend hours looking in the mirror, but they are not being vain, as they do not think they are attractive. People with BDD usually realize that worrying about their looks so much is bad, but they can not help it.\nALSO a person with BDD may alternatively avoid mirrors at all costs. Or any reflective surfaces for that matter. Including spoons, windows, mirrors, etc.\nTreatments.\nResearch found that talking as therapy, has not worked to stop BDD. However, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has been found to be more effective. In a study of 54 patients with BDD, some of them had Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and some had no treatment. BDD symptoms decreased a lot in those patients undergoing CBT. BDD was eliminated in 82% of cases at post treatment and 77% at follow-up. (8) Due to low levels of serotonin in the brain, another commonly used treatment is SSRI drugs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor). 74 subjects were enrolled in a placebo controlled study group to evaluate the efficiency of fluoxetine hydrochloride, a SSRI drug. Patients were randomized to receive 12-weeks of double-blind treatment with fluoxetine or the placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, 53% of patients responded to the fluoxetine.\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder is a chronic disease that has symptoms that never subside. Instead, they get worse as time goes on. Without treatment, BDD could last a lifetime. In many cases, as illustrated in The Broken Mirror by Katharine Phillips, the social lives of many patients disintegrates because they are so preoccupied with their appearance."}

Each casing block was then trimmed so that the outer surface of the pyramid would be smooth and white. Some capstones were covered with metal leaf.\nThe casing blocks from the Great Pyramid of Giza were all removed in the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. and used to build the city of Cairo. Some casing blocks still remain on the top of the pyramid next to Khufu's (belonging to Khafra). \nThe ancient Egyptians built pyramids as tombs for the pharaohs and their queens.

It was the first of three so-called \"Kingdom\" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley (the others being Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom).\nOld Kingdom was the best by the Third Dynasty through to the Sixth Dynasty (2686 BC \u2013 2134 BC). Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized at Memphis. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline that is called the First Intermediate Period by Egyptologists.\nThe royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was Memphis. During the Old Kingdom era the great pyramids were built to be burial tombs for the Pharaohs. Because Pharaohs were believed to be given authority from heaven, they wished to walk to Ra, their Sun-god, after death. King Zoser's adviser Inhotep designed the pyramid, hoping to easily reach Ra. The tombs were built on the west bank of the Nile where the sun seemed to set. For this reason, the Old Kingdom is sometimes called \"The Age of the Pyramids.\"\nKhufu, called Cheops, was the Pharaoh who built the Great Pyramid at Giza, near Cairo. He believed his soul never died, so they stored food, clothes, and things he owned in the rooms of the pyramid. The Great Pyramid is one of the Seven Wonders of the World: tall as a forty-story building, it took a hundred thousand men twenty years to build. With only ramps and physical energy, they had to move and lift into place 2,300,000 blocks of limestone that were about two and one-half tons apiece. Slaves, farmers, and gangs of men had to work on the Great Pyramid, and were paid with valuable things, not coins (Egyptians had no coins).\nTo guard the pyramids, a huge stone statue called the Great Sphinx was created and placed nearby. The Great Sphinx has a man's head and a lion's body, with paws 50\u00a0ft (15 m) long.\nAt last, the priests overthrew the Pharaohs. Then the nobles and priests ruled."}

Research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read.\nFormulae for predicting how difficult a sample of prose will be for readers are called \"readability formulae\". Some measure only the difficulty of the vocabulary: they are one-variable measures. Others include a measure of syntax such as sentence length.\nValidity of the formulae.\nValidity of formulae can be judged by comparing them to each other, which is a kind of consistency check. More important is a check for how well they predict an independent (\"outside\") criterion of readability.\nOne way to do this is to use a set of graded test passages. There the correlation coefficient of the better formulae \"hovers around 70%\".p113 There have been many dozens of experimental tests, summarised by Klare.p121\u2013156 Correlations between readability measures and comprehension scores on passages are usual, as are correlations between readability scores are grade levels as chosen by experienced teachers. Quite an important result was got by Murphy, who increased the readability of a farm journal and found the readership much increased.\nOne-variable formulae.\nSMOG.\nThe SMOG formula uses one variable to predict the difficulty of a passage of prose. It was developed G. Harry McLaughlin in 1969 to make calculations as simple as possible. Like Gunning-Fog the formula uses words which have 3 or more syllables as an indicator for hardness; these words are said to be polysyllabic.\nThe original formula was given for samples of 30 sentences. It is:\nThis can be adjusted to work with any number of sentences:\nMcLaughlin also created directions for an approximate version which can be done with just mental calculation. \nTwo-variable formulae.\nThe Dale\u2013Chall formula.\nEdgar Dale, a professor of education at Ohio State University, was one of the first critics of Thorndike's vocabulary-frequency lists. He claimed that they did not distinguish between the different meanings that many words have. He created two new lists of his own. One, his \"short list\" of 769 easy words, was used by Irving Lorge in his formula. The other was his \"long list\" of 3,000 easy words, which were understood by 80 percent of fourth-grade students. In 1948, he incorporated this list in a formula which he developed with Jeanne S. Chall, who was to become the founder of the Harvard Reading Laboratory. \nTo apply the formula:\nRaw Score = 0.1579PDW + 0.0496ASL + 3.6365\nWhere: \nFinally, to compensate for the \"grade-equivalent curve,\" apply the following chart for the Final Score:\nIn 1995, Dale and Chall published a new version of their formula with an upgraded word list.\nFlesch reading ease score.\nThe formula for the Flesch reading-ease score is\nScores can be interpreted as shown in the table below.\nThe US Department of Defense uses the reading ease test as the standard test of readability for its documents and forms. Florida requires that life insurance policies have a Flesch reading ease score of 45 or greater.\nUse of this scale is so ubiquitous that it is bundled with popular word processing programs and services such as KWord, IBM Lotus Symphony, Microsoft Office Word, WordPerfect, and WordPro.\nGunning Fog.\nThe Gunning Fog, sometimes called the Fog index, is a formula developed by Robert Gunning. It was first published in his book \"The Technique of Clear Writing\" in 1952. It became popular because the score is easy to calculate. \nThe formula has been criticized as it mainly uses sentence length. The critics argue that texts created with the formula will use shorter sentences without using simpler words. However, this criticism confuses \"prediction of difficulty\" with production of prose (writing). The role of readability tests is to predict difficulty; writing better prose is quite another matter. As discussed in prose difficulty, sentence length is an index of syntactical difficulty.\nWhere:\nSpache.\nThe Spache method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called \"unfamiliar\". The number of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula. The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text. It is designed to work on texts for children in primary education or grades from 1 to 7.\nIn 1974 Spache revised his Formula to: \nColeman-Liau Index.\nThe calculations are performed in two steps. The first step finds the Estimated Close Percentage. The second step calculates the actual grade.\nA simple version also exists that is not as accurate:\nAutomated Readability Index.\nThe Automated Readability Index was designed for real-time computing of readability for the electric typewriter."}

These nomes began as autonomous city-states, but later began to join together. According to ancient tradition, the ruler Menes finally joined all the nomes into a single kingdom.\nThe nomes remain in place for more than 3,000 years.\nLower Egypt, from the Old Kingdom capital Memphis to the Mediterranean Sea, had 20 nomes. The first was based around Memphis, Saqqara, and Giza, in the area occupied by modern-day Cairo. The nomes were numbered in a more or less orderly fashion south to north through the Nile delta. The numbering started in the west, and continued with the higher numbers in the east. Alexandria was in the Third Nome; Bubastis was in the Eighteenth.\nUpper Egypt was divided into 22 nomes. The first of these was centered around Elephantine close to Egypt's border with Nubia at the First Cataract \u2013 the area of modern-day Aswan.

The surface is broken by numerous small boulders and stones that lie on the river bed, as well as many small rocky islets.

They block the waterway, since boats cannot safely carry cargo though.\nThe six first cataracts of the River Nile were the main obstacles for boats sailing on the Nile in antiquity. Counted upstream (from north to south), the First Cataract is in modern Egypt; the rest are in Sudan.\nThe word cataract comes from the Greek word \"Katarakhtes\" meaning \"waterfall\".\nIn ancient times, Upper Egypt extended from the Nile Delta to the first cataract. Further upstream, in what is modern Sudan, the land was later controlled by the Kingdom of Kush.\nThe cataract faces north, not south, because the river flows north, from Lake Victoria in the south.\nThe 1899 book \"The River War\" by Winston Churchill explains each of the cataracts."}

He was one of the greatest composers of the Renaissance. He changed music from the sound of medieval compositions and developed the style which led to the great compositions of the 16th century Renaissance composers such as Adrian Willaert, Palestrina, Lassus and Byrd.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nJosquin was born ca. 1450-55 and died in 1521.\nThe name Josquin was a common name in Northern France and Flanders at that time. It was the name of a Breton saint who had lived in that area in the 7th century. The name Des Prez started off as a nickname in the family, and gradually it became the family name. The name Josquin des Prez is spelt in several different ways in old documents. He is often simply called \u201cJosquin\u201d.\nWe know very little about his life. We know very little about what people thought about him during his life, although after his death many people admired his music. Even his birthplace is uncertain. We do not know where he got his musical training. He was described as a \u201cpupil of Ockeghem\u201d, but that may just mean that he studied Ockeghem\u2019s music.\nWe know that he became a singer in the chapel of Aix-en-Provence, the chapel of the Duke of Anjou. After the duke\u2019s death in 1480 he worked for King Louis XI of France until he, too, died in 1483. We do not know where he worked after that, but he had some music published, including six chansons. He probably worked for some time in Milan.\nItaly.\nIn 1489 Josquin went to Rome and worked in the pope\u2019s chapel. He stayed there at least until 1495, possibly later. There he wrote music for the chapel, including some motets. His music was becoming well known in some parts of northern Italy. It was a time of war in Italy. Several times the king of France invaded parts of Italy. Josquin seems to have written several pieces for the French royal court, including some funeral music on the death of King Louis XII in 1515.\nFor a year (1503-1504) he was maestro di cappella in Ferrara. He may have left that job because of an outbreak of the plague. A few months after he left the famous composer Jacob Obrecht took over the job. Obrecht was only paid half the salary that Josquin had been given. Very soon afterwards, Obrecht died of the plague.\nLater years in Northern France.\nFrom 1504 until his death in 1521 Josquin was back in Northern France, where had the job of provost in Cond\u00e9-sur-l\u2019Escaut, which may possibly have been his birthplace. The church was a very important one, and it had an excellent choir.\nBefore he died Josquin paid a lot of tax to make sure that after his death his property did not go to the local lord of the manor but would be given to his church. After his death his house was sold, and the money was used for special church services to remember him. There was a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the wall of his old house, and when church processions passed by they stopped in front of it and sang Josquin\u2019s motets \"Pater Noster\" and \"Ave Maria\".\nHis Music.\nHis music is nearly all choir music. It consists mainly of church music: motets and masses, although he also wrote some secular (non-religious) music, including some chansons (French songs) and some instrumental music. One popular song is called \"El Grillo \". It means \u201cthe cricket\u201d and it describes the sound of a cricket singing in the grass.\nJosquin was a master of polyphony. His name had become so famous that, after his death, many publishers printed music by other composers and pretended it was by Josquin so that more people would buy it. During recent years musicologists have studied many of these manuscripts very carefully and tried to decide which ones were really by Josquin."}

He has worked in theatres and television.\nLife.\nGrillo was born in Savignone, a small town in the Province of Genoa, Liguria. Grillo became a comedian improvising a monologue at an audition. Two weeks later he was discovered by Italian television presenter Pippo Baudo. He participated in the variety show \"Secondo Voi\" for two years (1977-78). Later, in 1979, he was in \"Luna Park\" and \"Fantastico\".\nIn 1984 he participated to \"Te la do io l'America\" (four episodes) and \"Te lo do io il Brasile\" (6 episodes). On these shows, he spoke about his visits to the United States and Brazil and talked about their culture and lifestyle.\nHis popularity grew more and more. He became the protagonist of another show called \"Grillometro\" (\"Grillometer\"). Soon after this, his performances started to have more and more political satire. He often insulted politicians. In 1987 during the Saturday night television programme \"Fantastico 7\", he made comments about the Italian Socialist Party and its leader Bettino Craxi who had just taken a trip to China. Grillo said, \"If the Chinese are all socialists, whom do they steal from?\" The Italian Socialist Party did not like this because he was calling them thieves. After this episode, Grillo slowly was banned from the publicly owned television. Grillo not back on television until the political party was forced to disband several years later.\nIn 1993, Grillo was allowed on public television one more time. This show was watched by 16 million of Italians. This was the most viewers ever for Italian television.\nHis blog.\nGrillo has a daily blog where he speaks about alternative energy, globalization, and technology. Versions of the blog are in English, Italian and Japanese. Posts in the Italian version will commonly get thousands of comments and replies from people. His blog is one of the 10 most viewed blogs. He often gets letters from important people who support his blog. These people include Antonio Di Pietro (Italian Minister Of Infrastructures), Fausto Bertinotti (President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies), Renzo Piano, and even Nobel Prize Winners like Dario Fo, Joseph E. Stiglitz, Dalai Lama, Muhammad Yunus.\nGrillo commonly fights against corruption in his blog. He has used it to help create change in the Italian government. He wants any politician who have been found guilty of a crime to be removed from office.\nM5S.\nGrillo founded the politic party Five Star Movement in 2009.\nProblems with justice.\nIn 1980, Grillo was found guilty of manslaughter for a car accident in which he was the driver. Three passengers lost their lives.\nGrillo never hesitates to name firms and people he believes are corrupt. He always supports his views with data and documents. This has caused him to be sued several times for libel by many people and organizations which he had exposed, such as Telecom Italia.\nCritics.\nGrillo is often criticized for his lifestyle. They do not think it is correct for him to own a motor yacht and a Ferrari when these things are against his ecological statements. Beppe Grillo said that he did own them, but that he had sold them since then. It is also said that he is just saying what is wrong about politicians based on the popular opinions of the people and does not give any other ways things should be done."}

{"id": "86883", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86883", "title": "Legitimacy", "text": "The word Legitimacy means something which is good and right. Why the thing is right may be because it follows the law, a religion says it is right, or maybe it is naturally right. People may not agree about what is right, and because of this they may not agree what \"Legitimacy\" is and what is \"Legitimate\". There are two different uses of the word \"Legitimacy\"\nPolitical Legitimacy.\nWhen a government is accepted by many people it is considered to have \"Legitimacy\". In the past, some different reasons were used to make people accept a government. In the Zhou Dynasty of old China the rulers said they were given the \"Mandate of Heaven\" which means that the ruler was chosen by God. This is similar to the divine right of kings doctrine in Europe, where kings would say they were chosen by God.\nIn the time of The Enlightenment, John Locke wrote that Legitimacy came from the agreement of the people under the government. In Western thinking, this has become the accepted meaning. Not all the people must agree, only most of the people. Most of the people must agree that the government is the best way to make laws and rule, if the government has Legitimacy.\nMax Weber said there are three kinds of political Legitimacy:\nChildren and Families.\nIn common law, legitimacy is the status of a child who is born to parents who are legally married to each another. In the opposite, illegitimacy describes someone whose parents were not married. Such a person was called \"illegitimate\", literally means \u201cnot legal\u201d (against the law). Virtually everyone alive today has ancestors who were born illegitimately. \nPeople\u2019s attitude towards illegitimacy has varied in different parts of the world. In the Western world, especially in countries which were very religious, it was thought to be very bad for parents to have a child if they were not married. It was thought to be a sin. Illegitimate children were often called bastards. Historically, under English law, an illegitimate child was (a child of no one) and so could not get an Inheritance from his or her parents. In older times, such children were often brought up by other people, sometimes by relatives.\nToday people\u2019s attitude has changed, and the laws have changed so that people born to unmarried parents are not discriminated against unfairly. In the United States, people are not described any longer as \u201cillegitimate\u201d but as \u201cborn out of wedlock\u201d (\u201cwedlock\u201d means \u201cmarriage\u201d). In the United Kingdom the idea of illegitimacy was stopped by law in 1991. Fathers now have a responsibility to their children, even if they were born out-of-wedlock. Many religions still maintain that sex outside marriage is a sin, although they no longer say that the child lives in a state of sin."}

It is played in Wimbledon, a suburb of London in England, Great Britain. The Championships are unique because they are the only Grand Slam played on a grass court. Wimbledon is the third tennis grand slam of the year and is widely seen as the biggest event on the sport's calendar.\nWimbledon was first competed in 1877. The women's single and the mens doubles events began seven years later in 1884. It has always been played during the summer. It is played over two weeks, from late June to the beginning of July. The tournament is played after the French Open and before the U.S. Open. In 1968, the championships were opened up to both professionals and amateurs for the first time, with Rod Laver and Billie Jean King winning their respective singles titles.\nThe winners in 2016 were Andy Murray and Serena Williams.\nTraditions.\nSeedings.\nIn every tennis competition, players are given a seed to help decide their place in the draw. At Wimbledon, they use a player's performances (whether good or bad) on grass to help decide the seed. At other tennis competitions, seeding are chosen based only on rankings.\nClothing.\nThe umpires (referees) and linesmen all have to wear special dark green and mauve clothing. The players have to wear all white.\nEtiquette.\nFemale players used to have their names announced with \"Miss\" or \"Mrs\"; this was unlike any other Grand Slam tournament. However, this changed for the 2009 tournament. In this tournament, only the surnames were used. If The Queen is in the audience, it is normal for players to bow to her."}

The oldest is Washington County (created June 4, 1800) and the youngest is Houston County (created February 9, 1903).\nAlabama was claimed by Spain, as Spanish Florida, and by England, as the Province of Carolina. The first permanent colony was made by the French on the banks of the Mobile River in 1702.\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, West Florida south of the 31st parallel became a part of Spain while most of the rest was put in the Mississippi Territory. The territorial assembly established some of the earliest county divisions which have survived to the present. In 1817 the western part of the territory became the State of Mississippi and the remainder the Alabama Territory. The Alabama territorial legislature made some more counties.\nAlabama became the 22nd state of the United States in 1819. The Alabama state legislature made more counties from former Indian lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama.\nIn 1820, Alabama had 29 counties. By 1830 there were 36, with Indians still occupying land in northeast and far western Alabama. By 1840, 49 counties had been created; 52 by 1850; 65 by 1870; and the present 67 counties by 1903.\nAccording to 2006 U.S. Census estimates, the average population of Alabama's sixty-seven counties was 68,642, while Jefferson County had the most people (656,700), and Greene County (9,374) had the least. The average land area is . The largest county is Baldwin (), and the smallest is Etowah ().\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry.

It is usually produced by plants in the family Fabaceae. Legumes can be a variety of fruits: peas and beans are types of legumes.\nDescription.\nLegumes grow from the carpel, the female reproductive part of a plant. The fruit of a legume is found inside a pod that can be split on both sides. However, there are some foods that grow inside pods that are not legumes.\nHealth.\nLegumes contain many healthy nutrients, such as protein. They are a good source of protein for vegetarians and vegans, or people who do not eat meat and fish. They also contain fibre. This helps to have a healthy digestive system. However, they contain some nutrients which humans find difficult to digest. It is recommended that legumes are soaked (left in water) before cooking to help with nutrient absorption (taking in more nutrients). Some amino acids, such as methionine, are not found very much in some legumes. However, they are needed to help the body use protein.\nUse.\nIndia imports (buys from other countries) the most legumes. This may be because a lot of Indians follow the religion of Hinduism, which does not let people eat meat. Legumes are a cheap and plentiful source of food in a country where around 22% of the population are in poverty. The top four producers and exporters (selling to other countries) of legumes are:\nThe USA uses legumes for a variety of reasons. It is the highest producer. It uses soybeans to feed cattle and make vegetable oil. Peanuts are a popular snack food in the USA and these are also a type of legume."}

{"id": "86924", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86924", "title": "Lightning rod", "text": "A lightning rod or lightning conductor is an iron rod that is used to make lightning strike it, rather than strike something else. It is part of a lightning protection system. Such a system is made of many such rods. These rods are usually placed at high points of buildings and structures. In addition, paths are made the electricity can take from the rooftop to the ground, it was made in the year 1749 later improved in 1752. \nHistory.\nLightning can damage structures made of most materials (masonry, wood, concrete and even steel). The huge currents involved can heat materials, and especially water to high temperatures. This will cause fire, loss of strength and explosions from super-heated steam and air.\nEurope.\nThe church tower was usually the highest structure or building in medieval European towns and villages. It was also the building very often hit by lightning. Early on, Christian churches tried to prevent the damage of lightning by prayers. Priests prayed,\nPeter Ahlwardts (\"Reasonable and Theological Considerations about Thunder and Lightning\", 1745) said people who sought to protect themselves from lightning should go anywhere except in or around a church. \nIn Europe, the lightning rod was invented by a theologian and natural scientist, V\u00e1clav Prokop Divi\u0161, between 1750 and 1754. He is the inventor of the first grounded lightning rod, which he erected on 15 July 1754 in the garden of his home in P\u0159\u00edm\u011btice u Znojma. It consisted of 400 sharp metal spikes attached at the top of a 42\u00a0m tall supporting pylon. The structure was fastened by three metal chains, conductively attached to the iron grounding cones buried in the packed down soil. He described his 'weather machine' in the treatise 'Descriptio machinae meteorologicae'. The original idea was to continually sap the electricity out of the clouds and so actually \"prevent\" the lightning and the storms, only in case this failed, the machine should have also been able to directly attract the lighting and channel it to the ground. He proposed his machine to be used on church towers and ships. He was sending his observations regarding the machine operation to Jan Anton\u00edn Scrinci, the physics professor at the Charles University in Prague, who published them in 'Prager Postzeitungen', 'Br\u00fcnner Intelligenz-Zettel' and in 'Stuttgartisches Journal'. The machine is also mentioned by Leonhard Euler in 'Lettres \u00e0 une Princesse d' Allemagne'. In 1755 Divi\u0161 asked the Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria to let him build more machines on several places for the welfare of the people. The emperor let the mathematicians in Vienna judge the proposal, but they refused it. Abb\u00e9 Marci, court mathematician and Divi\u0161' friend commented: 'Blasphemant, quae ignorant' (condemning what they do not know). In 1756 the machine was damaged by wind and then rebuilt, and then on 10 March 1760, angry villagers of P\u0159\u00edm\u011btice tore down the structure, blaming Divi\u0161 for drought which struck the region that year. Later in the year, after the summer during which the thunderstorms did a lot of damage to the fields and vineyards, the people besought him to rebuild the machine, which he did in the precinct of Loucky monastery, and built another one on the top of the church tower in P\u0159\u00edm\u011btice.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the pointed lightning rod conductor, often incorrectly referred to as the \"lightning attractor,\" was invented by Benjamin Franklin as part of his groundbreaking explorations of electricity. Franklin thought that, with an iron rod sharpened to a point at the end,\n\"The electrical fire would, I think, be drawn out of a cloud silently, before it could come near enough to strike [...].\"\nFranklin speculated about lightning rods for several years before his reported kite experiment. This experiment, in fact, took place because he was tired of waiting for Christ Church in Philadelphia to be completed so he could place a lightning rod on top of it. There was some resistance from churches who felt that it was defying divine will to install these rods. Franklin countered that there is no religious objection to roofs on buildings to resist precipitation, so lightning, which he proved to be simply a giant electrical spark, should be no different. As an act of philanthropy, Franklin decided against patenting the invention.\nIn the 19th century the lightning rod became a symbol of American ingenuity and a decorative motif. Lightning rods were often embellished with ornamental glass balls (now prized by collectors). The ornamental appeal of these glass balls has also been incorporated into weather vanes. \nBalls of solid glass occasionally were used in a method thought to prevent lightning strikes to ships. It is worth noting here not because it worked, which it did not, but because it reveals a lot about pre-scientific thought. Glass objects do not conduct electricity well. They are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, there must be something about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.\nNikola Tesla's was an improvement in lightning protectors. The patent was granted due to a fault in Franklin's original theory of operation; the pointed lightning rod actually ionizes the air around itself. This makes the air conductive, which in turn raises the probability of a strike. Many years after receiving his patent, in 1919 Dr. Tesla wrote an article for The Electrical Experimenter entitled \"Famous Scientific Illusions\", in which he explains the logic of Franklin's pointed lightning rod and discloses his improved method and apparatus."}

The county seat (capital city) is Bay Minette.\nHistory.\nBaldwin County was made on December 21, 1809 ten years before Alabama became a state. Before this, the county had been a part of the Mississippi Territory until 1817 when the area passed into the Alabama territory\nThe borders of the county has often changed, and many armies have invaded.\nIn the first days of Baldwin County, the town of McIntosh Bluff (now in Mobile County) on the Tombigbee River was the county seat. Then the county seat moved to the town of Blakeley in 1810, and then to the City of Daphne in 1868. In 1900, by an Act of the Legislature of Alabama said that the county seat should move to the City of Bay Minette. The City of Daphne was not happy about this move, because being the county seat meant more people visit the city and businesses can sell more. To move the county seat to Bay Minette, some men from Bay Minette pretended that there had been a murder. When the sheriff and his deputy left the City of Daphne to look for the murderer the men from Bay Minette went to the City of Daphne. These men got the records from the Baldwin County Courthouse and took them back to the City of Bay Minette. A New Deal mural in the Bay Minette post office is a painting of this story.\nBaldwin County is close to the Gulf of Mexico. This is why it often has tropical weather systems which often are Hurricanes. Weather dameage can sometimes be very bad, and sometimes the county is made a \"disaster area\". For example, in September 1979 due to damage from Hurricane Frederic, in July 1997 due to Hurricane Danny, in September 1998 from Hurricane Georges in September 2004 due to damage from Hurricane Ivan and again in August 2005 due to damage from Hurricane Katrina.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of . of it is land and is water.

In the 1930s, he became a French citizen. He is famous for his theories about modernism in architecture. His plans included the improvement of housing for people in large cities. This was because many people lived in poverty at that time. Many of his designs have been built across the world.\nHe also liked to paint and was skilled at designing furniture.\nEarly life.\nLe Corbusier grew up in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town in the north of Switzerland. In 1907, aged 19, he moved to the French city of Paris. He travelled across Europe, and learned a lot of new ideas. He learned to speak German and worked with famous architects, such as Peter Behrens.\nThe World War.\nDuring World War I, Le Corbusier went back to Switzerland and became a teacher. Soon, he opened his own architectural business with his cousin, and they worked together until 1940. It was in 1918 that he met a painter, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, who would become a great friend. They combined their ideas to create a new type of art called Purism.\nPost-World War.\nAfter the war, Le Corbusier concentrated on his art until 1922. After this, he began designing apartments that could be stacked on top of each other, to house people and meet their needs. This type of low-density housing was to deal with the problem of over-crowding in Paris. He said this transformation was needed, or a revolution could occur from the unhappy lower classes. He created a design for an ideal city (Ville Contemporaine) that was never built. It was a plan developed around a lot of skycrapers. He presented this plan to the French government, who refused it. This did raise their awareness of overcrowding in the city though.\n1930s.\nLe Corbusier began to dislike capitalism, and said that people's house size should depend on the size of their family, and not by how rich they were.\nLater life.\nLe Corbusier was not active in politics from 1942. Instead, he built smaller housing blocks around France.\nHis name.\nThe name, Le Corbusier, is French. It is a different version of his grandmother's surname, Lecorb\u00e9sier. The name translates in to English as \"the crowlike one\". He chose this name in 1920.\nFamous ideas.\nHe considered speed in architecture by saying that house is a machine to live in. This machine's purpose is to speed up the activities of the people who live in it.\nHe introduced an idea of building a residence with just some slabs, columns, and, stairs. These three things can produce any kind of residence, for any class of people."}

It has shops and products around the world.\nHistory.\nThe company, originally named Prada Brothers, was started in 1913 by Mario Prada in Milan, Italy. Mario Prada did not believe that women should have a role in business and prevented any female family members from joining his company.\nHowever when he died in 1958, his son had no interest in running the company so his daughter, Luisa Prada, took over and ran the company until 1978. \nMiuccia Prada, Luisa\u2019s daughter, took over then and has been running the company since. Miuccia made the company bigger by giving it a more bohemian style.\nMiu Miu is a second clothing, which is often simpler, and fits with the 'high' image of vintage items. Miu Miu is the nickname of Miuccia Prada when she was a child. After, Prada Sport 'Linea Rossa' was made.\nToday, Prada is seen as one of the most important clothing designers in fashion.\nBuying and Joining with other companies.\nAfter many other fashion companies started to buy or join with many other fashion companies, Prada tried to do the same thing. It went into debt so that it could buy Fendi in the early 1990s. Fendi was not making much money, and needed help. Prada could not help Fendi, so it sold it to LVMH. Prada is still in debt after buying Fendi. In 1999, the company bought \"Church's\", an English company that makes quality shoes. More recently 45% of \"Church's\" has been sold to Equinox.\nOther big buys by Prada in the 1990s were Helmut Lang and Jil Sander. However, by 2006, Prada had sold both. Jil Sander was sold to 'Change Capital Partners', which is run by Luc Vandevelde (the chairman of Carrefour). Helmut Lang is now owned by Japanese fashion company 'Link Theory'.\nProducts made with other companies.\nIn May 2007, Prada and mobile phone maker LG Electronics worked together to make the LG Prada (KE850) phone. The phones were sold for $800 each.\nPrada Foundation.\nThe Prada Foundation () is a foundation dedicated to contemporary art and culture. It was founded in 1993. It is run by Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli. The foundation promotes art exhibitions and movie festivals.\nThe main site of the foundation is in Milan on Largo Isarco. The foundation also has a special gallery for photographs in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan and a site in Venice at the Palazzo Corner della Regina,\nBuildings.\nArchitects.\nPrada has paid for several famous architects, the most famous are Rem Koolhaas and Herzog &amp; de Meuron, to make their shops around the world.\nPrada Marfa.\nIn 2005, near the West Texas towns, Valentine and Marfa, two Scandinavian artists, Emily Milne and Zoe Brown, opened 'Prada Marfa', a sculpture of a Prada mini-boutique. The sculpture is on U.S. Highway 90 and is a long way from any other buildings. Prada helped pay for the building, which is 15 by 25-foot.

His father used to be a slave, but was known as a freedman because his master had freed him. They moved to Rome a short time later. Horace's father had a job taking items from the seller to the buyer. He received money from these sales. His father became richer and was able to send Horace to the best schools in Rome. He was also able to send him to Athens (Greece) to study the Greek language and philosophy. Horace's native language was Latin. Horace was incredibly proud of his father, and said he felt no shame in being the son of a freedman.\nIn his early adult life, Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator, was killed. War was declared against the people who killed him. Horace joined the army. When the war was over, Horace returned to Italy to find that other people were living in his apartment. His father was also gone. Horace became very poor. Eventually, he found a job in the treasury. This involved sorting the country's money.\nHis friends, Lucius Varius Rufus and Virgil, who were also writers, introduced him to Maecenas. Maecenas was a close friend of Augustus, the emperor of Rome. Horace lived in Tivoli, an area of Rome. When he died, he gave the land he owned to Augustus, to increase the land the state owned. Today, other writers visit the land to remember him.\nQuotes.\nHorace wrote many famous quotes in his poems. These lines are still spoken today, by speakers of every language, in the original Latin.\nPoetry.\nSome of Horace's poems are difficult to translate because of their syntax, grammar and structure, which is sometimes very different to modern languages.\nHorace is viewed by many people, including experts, to be one of the best Latin poets."}

{"id": "87077", "revid": "103847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87077", "title": "Group theory", "text": "In mathematics and abstract algebra, group theory studies a type of algebraic structure called a group. Group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures, such as a set of numbers along with its addition and multiplication. Because group theory is also useful for studying symmetry in nature and abstract systems, it has many applications in physics and chemistry.\nDefinition.\nA group is a set (collection) \"G\" whose members are called \"elements\". The elements can be numbers of some kind, or other abstract objects. The elements can even be material objects. There is also a binary operation which combines any two elements of \"G\" and results in another element of \"G\". This new element may be different from either of the original two, but it does not have to be: it only has to be an element of \"G\". To be a group, the following four conditions must be true of \"G\" and the operation defined over \"G\":\nAn important fact about groups is that when two elements are combined using the operation, the order of the elements matters. Switching the order of two combined elements typically gives a different result. This means that we have many cases with \"a\" \u2022 \"b\" \u2260 \"b\" \u2022 \"a\".\nHowever, if the order of a and b actually does not matter (for \"any\" a and b, we \"always\" have \"a\" \u2022 \"b\" = \"b\" \u2022 \"a\"), then the group is called an abelian group (or commutative group).\nIf a group contains finitely many elements, then it is called a finite group. If a subset of a group is also a group, then the subset is called a subgroup.\nExamples.\nA simple example of a group is the set of integers (called Z) with the addition operator +. This group is called \"G\" = (Z, +). Each of the required conditions is true of \"G\", so \"G\" is a group. If we replace \u2022 with the + sign, then we can easily check that these conditions are true:\nThe addition operator is also commutative: the order of \"a\" and \"b\" does not matter. For any two integers \"a\" and \"b\" in G, \"a\" + \"b\" = \"b\" + \"a\". For example, 7+3 is the same as 3+7. Thus, \"G\" is also an abelian group.\nCommutative operators are common in our daily lives. For example, 7 \u00b7 3 is also the same as 3 \u00b7 7. However, not all operations are commutative. For example, 7\u00f73 is different from 3\u00f77 (and neither of these results is an integer), and 73 is different from 37. Therefore, not all combinations of number sets and mathematical operations can form an abelian group\u2014or even a group at all."}

According to its area, Schwelm is the smallest town in North Rhine-Westphalia.\nPoints of interest.\nSchwelm is home to the \"Brauerei Schwelm\", the Schwelm Brewery, one of the few remaining private breweries in Germany. It was started in 1830 by Haarmann &amp; Kathagen, the brewery was one of the first worldwide to switch from wooden to metal barrels. The original office building of the brewery, the \"Rietz'sche Haus\" built in 1701, is still in use today.\nThe oldest piano manufacturer in the world is in Schwelm. Since 1794, \"Rud. Ibach Sohn\" has been building pianos and, until 1904, organs in Schwelm."}

{"id": "87185", "revid": "7799517", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87185", "title": "Politics of Germany", "text": "Politics of Germany are based on a federal parliamentary democratic republic. The government is elected by the people in elections where everyone has an equal vote. The constitution is called the \"Grundgesetz\". As well as setting out the rights of the people, it describes the jobs of the President, the Cabinet, the Bundestag, Bundesrat and the Courts.\nThe President is the head of state. The Federal Chancellor is the head of government, and of the majority group in the legislature (law making body) which is called the Bundestag. Executive power is exercised by the government. The power to make federal law is given to the government and the two parts of parliament, the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The ministers of the government are members of the parliament, and need parliamentary support to stay in power.\nFrom 1949 to 1990, the main political parties were the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), with its \"sister party\", the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU). After the reunification of Germany the Green Party and Alliance '90(B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen) became more important and was in government between 1999 and 2005. Other important political parties after reunification have been the PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism) which was based on East Germany's Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It joined with The Left Party (Die Linkspartei or Die Linke) of western Germany. In 2007 Die Linke and WASG joined together under the leadership of Oskar Lafontaine\nAs Germany is a federal country, a lot of the work of government is done by the 16 states (\"L\u00e4nder\"). Power is shared between the national (or federal) government and state governments. The national government cannot abolish the state governments.\nRights and the constitution.\nThe political system is set out in the 1949 constitution, the \"Grundgesetz\" (Basic Law), which stayed in effect after 1990's German reunification.\nThe constitution puts freedom and human rights first. It also splits powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative (law-making), executive (government), and judicial (courts) branches. The 1949 \"Grundgesetz\" was written to correct the problems with the Weimar Republic's constitution. The Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933 and was replaced by the dictatorship of the Third Reich.\nThe Federal Courts.\nThe courts of Germany are independent of the government and the lawmakers. Senior judges are appointed by the Bundestag for a fixed term.\nFederal executive branch.\nThe \"Bundeskanzler\" (Federal Chancellor) heads the \"Bundesregierung\" (Federal Cabinet) and thus the executive branch of the federal government. He or she is chosen by and must report to the \"Bundestag\", Germany's parliament. Germany, like the United Kingdom, can thus be said to have a parliamentary system.\nKonstruktives Misstrauensvotum.\nThe Chancellor cannot be removed from office during a 4-year term unless the \"Bundestag\" has agreed on a successor. This Constructive Vote of No Confidence () is meant to stop what happened in the Weimar Republic. There the government did not have a lot of support in the parliament. The small parties often joined together to vote against the government, but could never stay together and choose a new government.\nExcept in the periods 1969-72 and 1976-82, when the social democratic party of Chancellor Brandt and Schmidt came in second in the elections, the Chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party. Usually the largest party is helped by one or smaller more parties to get a majority in the parliament. Between 1969-72 and 1976-82 the smaller parties decided not to help the largest party, but the second biggest party instead.\nThe Chancellor appoints a Vice-Chancellor (Vizekanzler), who is a member of his cabinet, usually the Foreign Minister. When there is a coalition government (which has, so far, always been the case, except for the period of 1957 to 1961), the Vice-Chancellor usually belongs to the smaller party of the coalition.\nThe Federal Cabinet.\nThe Chancellor is responsible for policy guidelines. This means he, or she, sets the broad ideas of what the government will do. To help carry out these ideas the Chancellor can change the make-up of the federal ministries whenever they want. For example, in the middle of January 2001, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture was renamed to Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture. This was to help fight the \"Mad Cow Disease\" BSE problem. At the same time some of the jobs (\"competences\") of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Health were moved to the new Ministry of Consumer Protection.\nReporting to the cabinet is the Civil service of Germany.\nThe Federal President.\nThe duties of the \"Bundespr\u00e4sident\" (Federal President) are mostly representative and ceremonial; The power of the executive is exercised by the Chancellor.\nThe President is elected every 5 years on May 23 by the Federal Assembly (\"Bundesversammlung\"). The Bundesversammlung only meets to elect the President. Its members are the entire \"Bundestag\" and an equal number of state delegates selected especially for this purpose in proportion to election results for the state parliaments.\nIn February 2017, Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the SPD was elected. The reason that the President is not directly elected by the people is to stop him from claiming to be more powerful than the government and the constitution, which happened in the Weimar Republic.\n1) Although Mr. Steinmeier has been a member of the SPD, the German Basic Law requests in Article 55 that the Federal President does not hold another office, practice a profession or hold a membership of any corporation. Federal President has let his party membership rest dormant and does not belong to a political party during his term of office.\nFederal parliament.\nGermany has a bicameral legislature, that means that the parliament has two houses. The \"Bundestag\" (Federal Diet) has at least 598 members, elected for a four-year term. Half of the members (299) are elected in single-seat constituencies according to first-past-the-post. The other 299 members are chosen from statewide party lists.\nThe total percentage of constituency members and regional list members a party has should equal the percentage of votes that a party gets. This is called proportional representation.\nBecause Voters vote once for a constituency representative, and a second time for a party Germany is said to have mixed member proportional representation.\nSometimes a party already has more constituency seats in a \"land\" (state) than it should have to keep the percentage of votes and seats equal. The party does not lose seats. Instead it gets no land seats. This means that the Bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members. In the current parliament there are 16 overhang seats, giving a total of 614.\nA party must get 5% of the national vote or win at least three constituency seats to be represented in the \"Bundestag\". This rule, often called the \"five percent hurdle\", was made to stop lots of small parties being in the Bundestag. Small parties were blamed for the problems of the Weimar Republic's Reichstag.\nThe first \"Bundestag\" elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\") on August 14, 1949. Following reunification, elections for the first all-German \"Bundestag\" were held on December 2, 1990. The last election was held on September 24, 2017, the 19th Bundestag met on October 24, 2017.\nThe \"Bundesrat\" (Federal Council) is the representation of the state governments at the federal level. The Bundesrat has 69 members who are delegates of the 16 \"Bundesl\u00e4nder\". Usually the 16 Ministers President are members, but they do not have to be. The \"L\u00e4nder\" each have from three to six votes in the \"Bundesrat\", depending on population. \"Bundesrat\" members must vote as their state government tell them.\nPowers of the legislature.\nThe legislature has powers of exclusive jurisdiction (it can make laws by itself) and concurrent jurisdiction with the \"L\u00e4nder\" (the l\u00e4nder can also make laws). What laws and what type of laws are set out in the Basic Law.\nThe \"Bundestag\" does most law making.\nThe \"Bundesrat\" must concur (agree) to laws about money shared by the federal and state governments and those making more work for the states. Often this means that the \"Bundesrat\" often needs to agree to a law, because federal laws are often carried out by state or local agencies.\nSince the political make-up of the \"Bundesrat\" is often different from that of the \"Bundestag\", the Bundesrat is often the place for opposition parties to put their point of view, rather than for the states to look after their interests, as the constitution intended.\nTo limit, members of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat form a Vermittlungsauschuss which is a joint committee to try to reach agreement when the two chambers can not agree on a certain piece of legislation.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nBundestag.\nThe following parties are represented in the German Bundestag since the federal elections of 2017:\nTotal 709 seats.\nThe Pirate Party Germany and the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) got no seats.\nBundesrat.\nThe Federal Council is composed by representatives of the State governments.\nJudicial branch.\nGermany has had a court system that was free of government control for longer than it has had democracy.\nThis means that the courts have traditionally been strong, and almost all state actions are subject to judicial review (being looked at by the court).\nOrganisation.\nThere is the \"ordinary\" courts system that handles civil and criminal cases\nThis has four levels\nThere is also a system of specialist courts, that deall with certain areas of the law. These generally have a state court and state appeals court before coming to the federal supreme court for that area of law. The other federal supreme courts are\nUnlike the United States, all courts are state courts, except for the top level supreme courts.\nBundesverfassungsgericht.\nGermany also has another supreme court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht Federal Constitutional Court. The \"Grundgesetz\" says that every person may complain to the Federal Constitutional Court when his or her constitutional rights, especially the human rights, have been violated by the government or one of its agencies, and after he or she has gone through the ordinary court system.\nThe Bundesverfassungsgericht hears complaints about laws passed by the legislative branch, court decisions, or acts of the administration.\nUsually only a small percentage of these constitutional complaints, called \"(Verfassungsbeschwerden)\" are successful. Evenso, the Court is often angers both the government and the law-makers. The judges even say that they do not care about the reactions of the government, the Bundestag, or public opinion or about the cost of one of the court's decisions. All that matters is the constitution.\nThe Bundesverfassungsgericht is very high popular with ordinary people, because it protects them from government wrongdoing.\nOnly the Constitutional Court can handle some types of cases, including arguments between government bodies about their constitutional powers.\nOnly the Constitutional Court has the power to ban political parties for being unconstitutional. However so far the Constitutional court has only used this power twice, outlawing the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) and the SRP (Socialist Reich Party, a successor to the NSDAP) because both parties ideas went against the constitution.\nRecent political issues.\n\"Red-Green\" vs. Conservative-led coalitions.\nIn the 1998 election the SPD said they wanted to reduce high unemployment rates and said new people were needed in government after 16 years of Helmut Kohl's government.\nGerhard Schr\u00f6der said he was a centrist \"Third Way\" candidate like Britain's Tony Blair and America's Bill Clinton.\nThe CDU/CSU said people should look at how well off they were because of Kohl's government, and that the CDU/CSU had experience in foreign policy.\nBut the Kohl government was hurt at the polls by slower growth in the east in the previous two years, which meant the gap between east and west widened as the west got richer and the east did not.\nThe final seat count was enough to allow a \"red-green\" coalition of the SPD with Alliance '90/The Greens (\"B\u00fcndnis '90/Die Gr\u00fcnen\"), bringing the Greens into a national government for the first time.\nThe first months of the new government had policy disputes between the moderate and traditional left wings of the SPD, and some voters got fed up. The first state election after the federal election was held in Hesse in February 1999. The CDU increased its vote by 3.5%. The CDU became the largest party, and replaced a SPD/Green coalition with a CDU/FDP coalition. The result was seen in part as a referendum on the federal government's ideas for a new citizenship law, which would have made it easier for long-time foreign residents to become German citizens, and also to keep their original citizenship as well.\nIn March 1999, SPD chairman and Minister of Finance Oskar Lafontaine, who represented a more traditional social democratic position, resigned from all offices after losing a party-internal power struggle against Schr\u00f6der.\nIn state elections in 2000 and 2001, the respective SPD- or CDU-led coalition governments were re-elected into power.\nThe next election for the \"Bundestag\" was September 22, 2002. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der led the coalition of SPD and Greens to an 11-seat victory over the CDU/CSU headed by Edmund Stoiber (CSU). Two factors are generally cited that enabled Schr\u00f6der to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before: good handling of the 2002 European floods and firm opposition to the USA's 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nThe coalition treaty for the second red-green coalition was signed October 16, 2002. There were a lot of new ministers.\nConservative comeback.\nIn February 2003, elections took place in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony, were won by the conservatives. In Hesse, the CDU minister president Roland Koch was re-elected, with his party CDU gaining enough seats to govern without the former coalition partner FDP.\nIn Lower Saxony, the former SPD minister president Sigmar Gabriel lost the elections, leading to an CDU/FDP-government headed by new minister president Christian Wulff (CDU).\nThe protest against the Iraq war changed this situation a bit, favouring SPD and Greens.\nThe latest election in the state of Bavaria led to a landslide victory of the conservatives, gaining not just the majority (as usual), but two thirds of parliamentary seats.\nIn April 2003, chancellor Schr\u00f6der announced massive labour market reforms, called Agenda 2010. This included a shakeup of the system of German job offices (Arbeitsamt), cuts in unemployment benefits and subsidies for unemployed persons who start their own businesses. These changes are commonly known by the name of the chairman of the commission which conceived them as Hartz I - Hartz IV. Although these reforms have sparked massive protests they are now credited with being in part responsible for the economic upswing and the fall of unemployment figures in Germany in the years 2006/7.\nThe European elections on June 13, 2004 brought a staggering defeat for the Social Democrats, who polled only slightly more than 21%, the lowest election result for the SPD in a nationwide election since the Second World War. Liberals, Greens, conservatives and the far left were the winners of the European election in Germany, because voters were disillusioned by high unemployment and cuts in social security, while the governing SPD party seems to be concerned with quarrels between its members and gave no clear direction. Many observers believe that this election marked the beginning of the end of the Schr\u00f6der government.\nRise of the Right.\nIn September 2004, elections were held in the states of Saarland, Brandenburg and Saxony. In the Saarland, the governing CDU was able to remain in power and gained one additional seat in the parliament and the SPD lost seven seats, while the Liberals and Greens re-entered the state parliament. The far-right National Democratic Party, which had never got more than 1 or 2% of the vote, received about 4%, although it failed to earn a seat in the state parliament (a party must obtain at least 5% of the vote to achieve state parliamentary representation).\nTwo weeks later, elections were held in the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony: once again, overall, the ruling parties lost votes and although they remained in power, the right to far-right parties made the big leaps. In Brandenburg, the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU) re-entered the state parliament after winning 6.1% of the vote. In Saxony, the NPD entered a non-competition agreement with the DVU and obtained 9.2% of the vote, thus winning seats in the state parliament. Due to their losses at the ballots, the ruling CDU of Saxony was forced to form a coalition with the SPD. The rise of the right to far-right worries the ruling political parties.\nGerman federal election 2005.\nOn May 22, 2005 as predicted the SPD was defeated in its former heartland, North Rhine-Westphalia. Half an hour after the election results, the SPD chairman Franz M\u00fcntefering announced that the chancellor would clear the way for premature federal elections by deliberately losing a vote of confidence.\nThis took everyone by surprise, especially because the SPD was below 25% in polls at the time. On the following Monday the CDU announced Angela Merkel as conservative candidate for chancellorship.\nWhereas in May and June 2005 victory of the conservatives seemed highly likely, with some polls giving them an absolute majority, this changed shortly before the election at September 18, 2005, especially after the conservatives introduced Paul Kirchhof as potential minister of the treasury, and after a TV duel between Merkel and Schr\u00f6der where many considered Schr\u00f6der to have performed better.\nNew for the 2005 election was the alliance between the newly formed Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG) and the PDS, planning to join into a common party (see Left Party.PDS). With the former SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine for the WASG and Gregor Gysi for the PDS as prominent figures, this alliance soon found interest in the media and in the population. Polls in July saw them as high as 12%.\nAfter success in the state election for Saxony, the alliance between the far right parties National Democratic Party and Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), which planed to leapfrog the \"five-percent hurdle\" on a common party ticket was another media issue.\nThe election results of September 18, 2005 were surprising. They were very different from the polls of the previous weeks. The conservatives lost votes compared to 2002, reaching only 35%, and failed to get a majority for a \"black-yellow\" government of CDU/CSU and liberal FDP. The FDP polled a 10% of the votes, one of their best results ever. But the red-green coalition also failed to get a majority, with the SPD losing votes, but polling 34% and the greens staying at 8%. The left party alliance reached 8.7% and entered the German Parliament, whereas the NPD only got 1.6%.\nThe most likely outcome of coalition talks was a so-called \"grand coalition\" between the conservatives (CDU/CSU) and the social democrats (SPD), with the three smaller parties (liberals, greens and the left) in the opposition. Other possible coalitions include a \"traffic light coalition\" between SPD, FDP and Greens and a \"Jamaica coalition\" between CDU/CSU, FDP and Greens. Coalitions involving the Left Party were ruled out by all parties (including the Left Party itself), although the combination of one of the major parties and any two small parties would mathematically have a majority. Of these combinations, only a red-red-green coalition is politically even imaginable. Both Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Angela Merkel announced that they had won the election and should become next chancellor.\nOn October 10, talks were held between Franz M\u00fcntefering, the SPD chairman, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Angela Merkel and Edmund Stoiber, the CSU chairman. In the afternoon it was announced that the CDU/CSU and SPD would begin formal coalition negotiations with the aim of a Grand Coalition with Angela Merkel as the next German chancellor.\nAngela Merkel is the first woman, the first East German and the first scientist to be chancellor as well as the youngest German chancellor ever. On November 22, 2005 Angela Merkel was sworn in by president Horst K\u00f6hler for the office of Bundeskanzlerin."}

Many systems have been used in the past to write music. Today most musicians in the Western world write musical notes on a stave: five parallel lines with four spaces in between them. However, there are many others, some of which are in use today in different cultures.\nWriting music down makes it possible for a composer who makes up (composes) a piece of music to let other people know how the music is supposed to sound. That music can then be played or sung by anybody who can \u201cread music\u201d. If music is not written down, then people can only learn other people\u2019s music by listening to it and trying to copy it. This is how folk music was traditionally learned.\n\"Some early ways of writing music\".\nCuneiform.\nThe earliest kind of notation was written on tablets using a way of writing called cuneiform. Music from Nippur from about 2000 B.C. has been found which seems to give an approximate idea of how the music should be played. A tablet from 1250 B.C. has musical notation which shows the names of the strings of a lyre. They are the earliest records we have of written music.\nAncient Greece.\nMusical notation from Ancient Greece showed the notes in more detail than the earlier cuneiform. It shows the pitch (how high or low the note is) and how long it lasts. It sometimes give an idea of the harmony. It was used from at least the 6th century BC until about the 4th century AD.\nEarly European musical notation.\nWhen music started to be written down in Europe it was music for the Roman Catholic church. The monks who wrote it down used a system of dots and strokes called neumes. They gave an idea of how high or low the notes were, but did not show the length of the notes. They may have been used by people who knew the music already and just needed a reminder of when to go up and down.\nPeople gradually realized that it was necessary to find a system which showed the exact pitch of the note. The first stave was just one single horizontal line. Gradually this increased to four lines. Guido d\u2019Arezzo, an Italian Benedictine monk who lived in the 11th century developed this system which soon led to the way of writing music that we know. By the 16th century everybody was using the 5 line stave. A system of bars (measures) was used everywhere by the end of the 17th century. At first the bar lines where there to show which notes should be played or sung together. Gradually the system we know today was developed in which each bar lasted the same length of time, and has a particular number of beats (counts) for each bar. By the end of the 17th century this was used by most musicians in European classical music.\nThe modern system of musical notation.\nToday we use a five-line staff. The pitch (highness or lowness of a note) is shown by where the note is put on the staff. There may also be sharps or flats in front of some of the notes. The music is read from left to right.\nA staff of written music usually has a clef in front. This shows exactly which notes are to be played. Notes which are very high or low can be put on extra lines called ledger lines above or below the stave.\nAfter the clef there is usually a key signature which shows the key of the piece: it shows which sharps or flats are to be used regularly.\nAfter the key signature is the time signature. Bars (measures) divide the piece into regular groupings of beats, and the time signatures show these groupings.\nAbove the music there is usually a word, or words, to show the tempo (speed) At various places in the music there will be dynamic marks to show how loud or soft to play.\nFor vocal music, words are written underneath the notes.\nWhen music is played by a large group of instruments such as an orchestra the music is written in a \"score\". This shows the music played by all the instruments, so there are many staves written underneath one another. The conductor will need to have a score, but the players will play from a \u201cpart\u201d which has just the notes that they play. All the parts needed for a piece of music is called a \u201cset of parts\u201d.\nSome other systems.\nInstruments such as guitars often play from a chord chart or just the names of the chords (C7, Em etc.) written underneath the music or under the words of a song.\nA system called solfege has been used by musicians ever since the Renaissance. This shows the names of the notes of a scale (do, re, mi etc.).\nLute music in the Renaissance and Baroque periods used to be written in a system called tabulature. Some 20th century composers have also used tabulature.\nSome modern composers such as John Cage have written music by making drawings called graphic notation.\nMusic can also be written in Braille for blind musicians.\nToday computers are often used for making music. This has led to other forms of music notation which are used in different systems of software. The MIDI file format, stores information about the pitch, duration, speed, volume etc. of notes and can be used to control a MIDI instrument.\nThere are other systems in use today for some non-Western music."}

Most of today's C-pop artists are from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as from other countries where Mandarin or Cantonese languages are used, such as Singapore and Malaysia. However, Taiwanese music has some origins from the Japanese enka so Taiwanese pop is sometimes said to be a different genre from C-Pop.\nCantonese pop.\nCantonese pop, or colloquially known as Cantopop, is a subgenre of C-pop, sung in Cantonese language. Most Hong Kong-born singers start off as Cantonese pop singers before starting a career as a Mandarin pop singer. Cantonese pop artists include:\nThe Four Heavenly Kings.\n\"The Four Heavenly Kings\" of Cantonese pop are Leon Lai, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Jacky Cheung.\nIn the early 1990s, many major Cantonese pop stars (such as Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Samuel Hui, Priscilla Chan and Joseph Koo) decided to retire because of the protests in China in 1989. Cantonese pop needed new talent to fill the gaps left by these retired stars, this led to the beginning of \"the Four Heavenly Kings\" or \"\u56db\u5927\u5929\u738b\" (\"lit.\" Four Great Kings of Heaven): Jacky Jeung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Leon Lai.

She was born on 1978. Stefanie has sold over 10 million copies in Asia. After her release of her tenth album, she is said to be the most popular Mandarin female singer in Asia and the most successful singer from Singapore.\nEarly life.\nStefanie Sun has an elder sister Sng Yee Kia and a younger sister Sng EeMei.\nStefanie wen to school at Saint Margaret's Secondary School, Raffles Girls' School and went on to attend Saint Andrew's Junior College. She later attended Nanyang Technological University, where she got a degree in Marketing. Her abilities were discovered by her music teacher at his music school.\nLanguages.\nAmong Mandarin-speakers, Stefanie is known by her Mandarin name, Sun Yan Zi. She speaks the Teochew dialect, and in Teochew her name is pronounced as \"Sng Ee Tze,\" which is her official name. Most of her songs are sung in Mandarin, with several in English. Stefanie's ability to speak many dialects is shown in the songs she sings. \nIn the song \"Cloudy Day\" (called \u5929\u9ed1\u9ed1 in Chinese), she sings in both Mandarin and Min Nan (Taiwanese). \"Cloudy Day\" is an adaptation of a traditional Taiwanese folk song.\nHer album START! contains 6 songs in English: \"Venus\", \"That I Will Be Good\", \"Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough\", \"Silent All These Years\", and \"Hey Jude\"; and a song she wrote called \"Someone\".\nCareer.\nStefanie does most of her recording and performing in Taiwan, where most of her fans are. She also visits China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, where many of her fans are.\nHer first music album was released in June 2000, the self-titled YanZi, published by Warner Music. The album sold over 330,000 copies in Taiwan. Her next album, which was released in December of the same year was titled My Desired Happiness or \u6211\u8981\u7684\u5e78\u798f in Chinese.

START was a collection of songs and cover versions. START! sold over 250,000 copies in Taiwan alone in less than a month and overall 1,000,000 copies sold in mainland China.\nIn 2002 and 2003, Stefanie sang the official theme songs for Singapore's National Day Parade: We Will Get There (\u4e00\u8d77\u8d70\u5230 in Chinese) and One United People (\u5168\u5fc3\u5168\u610f in Chinese). One United People was included on the album Leave.\nIn early 2003, she released the album To Be Continued\u2026 which like her previous releases, was a success. It sold more than 250,000 copies in Taiwan and more than 1,000,000 in China. Only a few months later, she released her seventh album with six new songs mixed with fifteen of her old songs. By the end of 2003, Stefanie had sold over 7,000,000 copies in Asia with just seven albums.\nIn late 2003, she decided to take a one-year break from making music, because she wanted to find again her direction in her career. She returned in late 2004 with a new album titled Stefanie, which was meant to reflect her debut album (self-titled as well, but in Chinese). This was to symbolise her return with a fresh attitude. This album sold more than 2,300,000 copies in Asia; making it her most successful album. She also started her own company called Make Music.\nA Perfect Day was released on 2005, almost one year later. Reviews of this new album were mixed, but Stefanie said that all she wanted was to make quality music, instead of releases that sell well but have a lower level of artistic quality. This album was not her highest-selling, but it had still managed to sell over 1,000,000 copies in Asia.\nIn 2006, Stefanie had 4 full-house concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum. The performances were praised by the media as well as fans. Stefanie also returned to Singapore in a much-anticipated homecoming concert. However, at The Golden Melody Awards 2006 in Taiwan, while performing songs that were meant to be for male singers, she went off-key, due to having not enough sleep, jet lag, and not having enough time to practice. The media said she had shattered her image of a pop diva with great singing skills. Though she had been heavily criticized by the media, many think that she did not perform as bad, instead the media had over-emphasized on her singing that night.\nStefanie\u2019s first album under the Capitol brand is entitled Against the Light or \u9006\u5149 in Chinese. It was released on 22 March 2007. Her decision to leave Warner after 9 albums was partly due to music executive Sam Chen, who now works at EMI. He had collaborated with Stefanie on 8 of her 9 albums.\nOn 26 February 2007, Stefanie returned from Cairo where she and her team were extorted by suspected local gangsters. Stefanie was in Egypt to shoot a PV for her new album. Two men disguised as government officials followed her and the crew and asked for money and even showing a handgun. The crew tried calling the police but the police didn\u2019t believe them. The crew had to hand over a total of over 200,000 yuan in order to continue shooting.\nStefanie\u2019s tenth album Against the Light, has been a major success in Asia. In Taiwan, it sold over 60,000 copies in the first 3 days it was released. In addition, over 500,000 copies were sold within a week in China. Stefanie was also the number one spot in the Taiwanese Music Charts for 4 weeks.\nIn 2007, Stefanie sang the offcial theme song for ASEAN's 40th anniversary celebrations: Rise. "}

She also speaks English but has not yet released any records fully in English.\nBiography.\nLi Yin was born on 18 February 1989 in Sichuan, China. She grew up in a musical family, as both of her parents were professional violinists. As a child, her parents took her to their rock concerts and exposed her to a variety of music. At three years old, she began to learn the violin. Li Yin liked classical, American and European music so much that she says she never sang children's songs when she was a child.\nAs she grew older, Li Yin became more into pop music than rock music. She had to secretly listen to pop music because her parents were against it. When she was twelve, she went to a middle school founded by the Sichuan Music College after scoring the highest with her violin-playing, but she chose to become a singer instead. She was selected as one of the top-ten teenage singers in a national singing competition in Beijing.

It is the first asteroid that was known to cross inside the orbit of Mars. Eros is one of the few NEAs bigger than 10\u00a0km across. It is thought to be bigger than the asteroid that made the Chicxulub crater in the Yucat\u00e1n and probably caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.\nOn January 31, 2012, Eros passed close to Earth at 0.1787 astronomical units (16.6 million miles).

At opposition, the asteroid actually appears to stop in place when compared to stars in the sky. Unlike most objects in the solar system, it never appears to be retrograde (back-track across the sky).\nEros was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker probe, which orbited it, taking many pictures of its surface. On February 12, 2001, at the end of its mission, NEAR landed on the asteroid's surface using its maneuvering jets.\nObjects in an orbit like Eros can exist for only a few hundred million years before the orbit is changed by the effects of gravity. Simulations suggest that Eros may evolve into an Earth-crosser within 2 million years (Michel et al., 1996).\nThe adjectival form which is not used a lot of the name Eros is \"Erotian\".\nPhysical characteristics.\nSurface gravity depends on the distance from a spot on the surface to the center of a body's mass. The Erotian surface gravity changes a lot, since Eros is not a sphere but a stretched peanut-shaped (or potato- or shoe-shaped) object. The daytime temperature on Eros stays at about 100\u00a0\u00b0C and nighttime measurements at \u2212150\u00a0\u00b0C. Eros's density is 2,400\u00a0kg/m3, about the same as the density of Earth's crust. Its day lasts 5.27 hours.\nNEAR scientists have found that most of the bigger rocks scattered across Eros were blown from a single crater in a meteorite collision approximately 1 billion years ago. This impact may also be the reason why nearly half of the Erotian surface doesn't have small craters. It was first thought that the debris thrown up by the collision filled in the smaller craters (those less than half a kilometer across). A study of crater on the surface shows that the areas with the fewest craters are within 9 kilometers of the impact point. This includes the opposite side of the asteroid but still within 9 kilometers.\nHistory.\nEros was found on the same night (13 August 1898) by Gustav Witt in Berlin and Auguste Charlois at Nice. Witt was taking a 2-hour exposure of beta Aquarius to get astrometric positions of asteroid 185 Eunike.\nIn 1975, Eros became the first asteroid to be detected by radar.\nEros was one of the first asteroids to be visited by a spacecraft, and the first to be orbited and soft-landed on. NASA spacecraft NEAR Shoemaker entered orbit around Eros in 2000, and came to rest on its surface in 2001."}

Early Christian writings use the word to refer to the will of God, the human will, and even the will of God's opponent, the Devil.\nThelema is also a way of life first written about by Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais (16th century) in his famous books of fiction, Gargantua and Pantagruel. The core of this way of life was summed up in the phrase \"Do what thou wilt\" (\"fay \u00e7e que vouldras\" in the original old French). This idea was later put into practice in the mid 18th century by Sir Francis Dashwood at Medmenham.\nThis Thelemic Law of Rabelais was revived by Aleister Crowley in 1904 when Crowley wrote \"The Book of the Law\". This book contains both the word \"Thelema\" in Greek as well as the phrase \"Do what thou wilt.\" From this, Crowley took Thelema as the name of his own religion. Thus Shri Gurudev Mahendranath wrote that Rabelais, Dashwood, and Crowley must share the honor of perpetuating Thelema.\nModern Thelema.\nBreadth of Thelemic thought.\nThe core of Thelemic thought is \"Do what thou wilt.\" However, people understand and apply this in different ways. For example, some people accept Crowley as a prophet. Other people regard Crowley's system to be only one form of Thelema. Crowley himself shared this view:\nMany followers of Thelema learn and use other systems of spiritual thought, blending them according to their own will with Thelema. Most borrow freely from other traditions. For example, Nu and Had are thought to be the same as or similar to the Tao and Teh of Taoism, Shakti and Shiva of the Hindu Tantras, Shunyata and Bodhicitta of Buddhism, Ain Soph and Kether in the Qabalah. Like Crowley, other followers of Thelema make free use of the methods and practices of other traditions, including alchemy, astrology, qabalah, tantra, tarot, and yoga, according to their own wills.\nSome groups say that they are true to Crowley's system (such as A\u2234A\u2234 and Ordo Templi Orientis). Some groups build upon his teachings, expanding upon and extending them. For example, the Fraternitas Saturni (Brotherhood of Saturn), founded in 1928 in Germany, accepts the Law of Thelema, but extends it with the phrase \"Mitleidlose Liebe!\" (\"Compassionless love!\"). The Thelema Society, also located in Germany, accepts Liber Legis and much of Crowley's work on magick, while also including the ideas of other thinkers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles S. Peirce, Martin Heidegger, and Niklas Luhmann. In America, the writings of Maggie Ingalls (Nema) have started a movement called Maat Magick, along with a group called the Horus-Maat Lodge, founded in 1979. This movement combines elements of Thelema with Nema's system based on the Egyptian goddess Ma'at. She wrote her own holy book titled \"Liber Pennae Praenumbra.\" The HML aims to combine the current Aeon of Horus with the future Aeon of Ma'at in which mankind will achieve balance.\nModern Thelemic writings.\nMost of Thelemic writing was written by Aleister Crowley. He wrote many books. Many of them were on the subject of Thelema. During his time, there were a few other people who wrote on the subject, including Charles Stansfeld Jones and J.F.C. Fuller. Since his death in 1947 only a few new writers have written on the subject, such as:\nThelema in comparative religion.\nThelema has been attracting more attention in recent years from scholars of religion, especially those interested in new religious movements, contemporary Gnosticisms and Hermeticisms. References at the end of this article supply a few such sources. Perhaps the most unusual attempt was made by bishop Federico Tolli, in his German book \"Thelema \u2013 Im Spannungsfeld zwischen Christentum, Logentradition und New Aeon\" For Tolli, Thelema is to be regarded as the dialectical consequence of Christianity. Christianity for Tolli exists as a community in Christ, whereas Tolli sees Thelema as a necessarily individualistic response to the world.\nTaken from a 1938 theological dictionary (to the New Testament), the concept of 'salvation history' \"(Heilsgeschichte)\" has a great effect on Tolli's thought, and it is in this context that he discusses Crowleyan Thelema. Tolli regards Crowley's \"Heilsgeschichte\" as one in which the whole Universe (ergo the Will of God) is to combine (analogous to the Alchemical formula 'coagula'). \"Love\", in the form of combinatory attraction (\"Love is the law, love under will\"), is a universal principle \u2013 therefore akin to the concept of Natural religion. The main difference (for Tolli) is that in Christianity salvation of the entire Universe (\"Ganzheit\") cannot be made by 'solipsistic' man. The bishop sees Crowley as a failed \u2013 however talented \u2013 artist or \"Mystagogie\", but not as a \"Satanist\". The merit and contribution of bishop Tolli to Thelemic studies lies in the fact that it was he who first expresses that the genuine meaning and idea of Thelema does not necessarily contradict the teachings of Jesus, as Crowley himself affirms."}

It is between Seoul and Busan, but is closer to Busan. Daegu is the fourth largest city in South Korea. About 2.4 million people live in Daegu. Of South Korea's 16 cities and provinces, Daegu is the poorest in terms of GDP per capita 2010 at $18,887 according to the IMF. Daegu residents are also regarded by all other South Koreans as the widely ultraconservative.\nHistory.\nIn 1995, 101 people were killed by gas explosions. In 2003, 192 people were killed in a subway fire.\nClimate.\nDaegu has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cwb\" in the Koeppen climate classification). Summer is hot, with very high rainfall. Daegu is one of the hottest cities in Korea. Winters are dry and cool.\nPopular places.\nPalgong Mountain is north of Daegu. It is famous for Donghwa Temple and Gatbawi. Gatbawi is a statue of Buddha. \nApsan(Ap Mountain), also called Daedeok Mountain has many well known restaurants. It is a good place to hike. Many hikers visit the Apsan Mountain. The downtown area of Daegu is Dongseongro. There is a festival every year in June. It also is the shopping center of Daegu. Woobang Tower Land is an amusement park with many rides and roller coasters. Daegu is also famous for having Daegu Stadium where the World Cup tournament was held in 2002.\nCulture.\nDaegu was the known for apples in Korea before 1990. Daegu has a herbal medicine market located in a street 1 kilometre long. The textile (cloth) industry was the primary industry from the 1960s but has seen drastic decline to the present day.. People in Daegu enjoy food. One example is ddeokbokki. Ddeokboki is a Korean rice cake with spicy red pepper sauce and vegetables. Foods in Daegu are usually more spicy and salty than in other cities.\nDaegu is widely regard by majority of Koreans and its own residents as the most conservative in its approach to values and life. A fact that is widely broad up and which all of Daegu people are proud of. Every district within the city shares a similar theme in its collection of business- Phone Retails Shops, Ghim-bab cheap food shops, plant shops, Paris Bagguette or Tour Les Jours chain bakeries, Karaoke dens which sometimes double as \"good-time\" business clubs, family owned and operated pharmacies, Korean Barbecue eateries.\nNon-Korean citizens do not open businesses of any size within the city because city legislation dictates that two or more Koreans are required be partnered to the businesses. The effect is every functioning business is owned and envisioned solely by a South Korean national.\nUnlike more famous cities such as Seoul or Busan, there is a single, homogeneous dominant culture in Daegu - Right-wing orthodox South Korean ultra-conservatives.\nForeign nationals form only three classes of long-term residents:\nIn descending numbers: \n(1) US Army personnel and their families garrisoned within three giant military bases located in Daegu.\n(2) Immigrant workers typically from Uzbekistan and Philippines hired to labour cheaply in Seo-Gu factories (all of West Daegu).\n(3) Foreign English teachers from the USA or UK clustering together. The white-skinned is held by local Daegu beliefs in improved teaching quality derived, and also a point of bragging to others - a popular Daegu boast, \"My son has a white-skinned English teacher.\".\nShort-term residents:\n(1) Japanese &amp; Chinese National exchange or language students (closest neighbours) who will find the racial climate: emotional &amp; touchy. Japanese: averages 3 to 4 months before permanent departure.

According to the Old Believers, Nikon did this without the support of the clergy. and without a council. When the changes were done, people who still practised the old rites were persecuted. "}

Light seems to act like both. At times, light seems to go only in a straight line, as if it were made of particles. But other experiments show that light has a frequency and wavelength, just like a sound wave or water wave. Until the 20th century, most physicists thought that light was either one or the other, and that the scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong.\nPresent situation.\nMax Planck, Albert Einstein, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Compton, Niels Bohr worked on this problem. Current scientific theory is that all particles act both like waves and like particles. This has been verified for elementary particles, and for compound particles like atoms and molecules. For macroscopic particles, because of their extremely short wavelengths, wave properties usually cannot be detected.\nExperiment.\nIn 1909, a scientist named Geoffrey Taylor decided that he was going to settle this argument once and for all. He borrowed an experiment invented earlier by Thomas Young, where light was shone through two small holes right next to each other. When bright light was shone through these two small holes, it created an \"interference pattern\" that seemed to show that light was actually a wave.\nTaylor's idea was to take a photo of the light coming out of the holes with a special camera that was unusually sensitive to light. When bright light was shone through the holes, the photo showed an interference pattern, just like Young showed earlier. Taylor then turned down the light to a very dim level. When the light was dim enough, Taylor's photos showed tiny pinpoints of light scattering out of the holes. This seemed to show that light was actually a particle. If Taylor allowed the dim light to shine through the holes for long enough, the dots eventually filled up the photo to make an interference pattern again. This demonstrated that light was somehow \"both\" a wave \"and\" a particle.\nTo make matters even more confusing, Louis de Broglie suggested that matter might act the same way. Scientists then performed these same experiments with electrons, and found that electrons too are somehow both particles and waves. Electrons can be used to do Young's double-slit experiment.\nToday, these experiments have been done in so many different ways by so many different people that scientists simply accept that both matter and light are somehow both waves and particles. Scientists are still unsure about how this can be, but they are quite certain it must be true. Although it seems impossible to understand how anything can be both a wave and a particle, scientists do have a number of equations for describing these things that have variables for both wavelength (a wave property) and momentum (a particle property). This seeming impossibility is referred to as the wave-particle duality.\nBasic theory.\nWave\u2013particle duality means that all particles show both wave and particle properties. This is a central concept of quantum mechanics.\nClassical concepts like \"particle\" and \"wave\" do not fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects.\nParticles as waves.\nAn electron has a wavelength called the \"de Broglie wavelength\". It can be calculated using the equation\nformula_1\nformula_2 is the de Broglie wavelength.\nformula_3 is Planck's constant\nformula_4 is the momentum of the particle.\nThis made the idea that electrons in atoms show a standing wave pattern.\nWaves as particles.\nThe photoelectric effect shows that a light photon which has enough energy (a high enough frequency), can cause an electron to be released off a metal's surface. Electrons in this case can be called photoelectrons."}

He was an excellent choirmaster and teacher. He spent most of his life working for the French royal court.\nLife.\nThe name Ockeghem is found with many different spellings in old documents. He was almost certainly born in the town of Saint-Ghislain. His native language was probably French.\nLike many composers in this period, he started to learn about music by singing in a church choir, quite possibly in Saint-Ghislain and then in Mons. \nHis first important job was working for Charles I, Duke of Bourbon in Moulins, (France). Then in 1451 he went to work for King Charles VII of France. By this time he was well known as a singer and composer. He worked for the royal court for more than 50 years and was rewarded with promotions and honours. Charles VII gave him important jobs. After Charles VII\u2019s death Louis XI became king. He reigned for a long time and Ockeghem was in favour with the king. He often travelled with the king, visiting places such as Cambrai and even as far as Spain. He met famous people including the composers Dufay and Binchois. He also had other jobs in Paris.\nLouis XI died in 1483. We do not kinow much about where Ockeghem went after that, but he probably died in Tours because that is where he left his will.\nMusic and influence.\nOckeghem was not a composer who wrote lots of music, but it is hard to tell as some of it might have got lost. There are 14 masses that survive and other vocal works. His \"Missa pro Defunctis\" is the earliest surviving polyphonic Requiem. Ockeghem based many of his masses on well-known tunes in a way that is called \u201ccantus firmus technique\u201d. Sometimes he put the borrowed tunes in the lowest part (he sang bass himself). This was rather unusual.\nOckeghem\u2019s music influenced Josquin des Prez and other composers from Flanders and the Netherlands. \nWhen Ockeghem died Josquin Des Prez composed a motet called \"La d\u00e9ploration de la mort de Johannes Ockeghem\" in his honour. The music theorist Johannes Tinctoris described him as a great musician and one of the best singers he knew. Many younger composers used some of Ockeghem\u2019s melodies as a base for their own compositions. In the Renaissance this kind of borrowing from the music ofc another composer was thought to be a great honour."}

Normally, all members of the jury have to agree on the decision. Sometimes, the jury can still make a decision even if a few members don't agree with it. However, if the jury is quite clearly divided, the result is known as a \"hung jury\" and the case is not decided. A member of a jury is called a juror. A juror is supposed to be impartial. This means that he or she is to be fair and listen to both sides of the story without deciding what side they will take ahead of time.\nTypes of juries.\nIn the United States there are primarily two types of juries which are the finder of facts in a trial:\nJuries by country.\nA jury in the United Kingdom is made up of 12 people for criminal cases and 10 people for civil cases (or 15 people in Scotland) these people are selected at random and are British citizens with no criminal record. Members are chosen from the electoral register for their local area and those chosen must attend jury duty.\nIn the United States, juries are made up of 12 regular people from the area in which the trial is held and are not members of the court system.

{"id": "87451", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87451", "title": "Pocahontas", "text": "Pocahontas (born around 1595buried on 21 March 1617) was an American Indian. She maintained relations between the Indians of Virginia and the colonists who built a fort and settlement on the James River called Jamestown in 1607. Legend says she saved John Smith's life when her father, Powhatan, was about to kill him.\nDuring a war with the Indians, she was captured and held for ransom. She was baptized Rebecca and improved her English language skills during captivity. In 1614 she married tobacco planter John Rolfe. They had a son Thomas. In 1616 the family went to London. Pocahontas became a celebrity. She died at Gravesend and was buried in England on 21 March 1617.\nLife.\nBirth and early years.\nThe year of Pocahontas's birth is unknown, but Camilla Townsend, author of \"Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma\", suggests that she was born about 1597. Her father was Powhatan, the chief of an alliance of tribes in Virginia. Her mother was a woman of no social importance. Pocahontas was named Amonute. By the age of ten, the child was nicknamed Pocahontas, which means \"playful one\". She had a name known only to her parents. It may have been Makoata.\nHer girlhood was much like the girlhood of others in the alliance. She took care of siblings, she cooked, she tanned hides, she searched for berries and other edible foods, she tended the corn, beans, and squashes in the gardens of her people. In the evenings, she listened to songs and stories about the gods and her people's past. She wove cords from fibers while sitting at the fireside with girls.\nJohn Smith.\nPocahontas was about ten years old when, in April 1607, colonist Captain John Smith arrived in Virginia. He and his men built a settlement called Jamestown. In December 1607, Smith was captured by an Indian party. He was taken to Powhatan's village. He enjoyed a feast and a talk with Powhatan. He did not meet Pocahontas.\nPocahontas made friends with Smith and the colonists. She often went to the settlement. When the colonists were starving, Pocahontas supplied them with food. As the settlement grew, the Indians felt their lands were threatened. Conflicts arose. In late 1609, Smith returned to England. The settlers told the Indians that Smith was dead. Pocahontas stopped visiting Jamestown. She later learned that he was alive in England.\nThe story of Pocahontas saving Smith's life by placing her head upon his own as her father was about to kill him is a fiction created by Smith in 1616. He wrote \"... at the minute of my execution, she [Pocahontas] hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was conducted to Jamestown.\" A romance between Pocahontas and Smith is also a fiction created by mythmakers in the early century.\nCapture.\nAs Jamestown expanded and settlements were built along the James, conflicts between the Indians and the English arose. In April 1613, Captain Samuel Argall learned Pocahontas was visiting a village on the Potomac River. He lured her aboard his ship and made her captive. Argall demanded the release of Powhatan's prisoners and the return of weapons and tools.\nPowhatan took no action. Pocahontas's captivity lasted about a year. She improved her English skills during this time. She embraced Christianity and the way of life. When her father released his prisoners and returned some tools, Pocahontas rebuked him for valuing axes and firearms more than his daughter. She told her people that she would rather remain with the English.\nMarriage to John Rolfe.\nHelen Rountree writes that Pocahontas began menstruating sometime in 1610. She then married a warrior and commoner named Kocoum. It is unknown where the couple lived or if they had children. This marriage ended by custom when she was captured by the English in 1613.\nPocahontas met 28 year old colonist John Rolfe during her captivity in Henricus. Rolfe was a widower and a successful tobacco planter. He was a gentle and pious man. He wrote a letter to the governor asking permission to marry Pocahontas. He expressed both his love for her and his belief that he would be saving her soul. He assured the governor that he was \"motivated not by the desire of affection (attraction), but for the good of this plantation, for the honor of our country, for the Glory of God, for my salvation.\"\nIn early April 1614, Pocahontas declared herself a Christian. She was baptized. Her name would be Rebecca. Pocahontas and Rolfe were married on 5 April 1614 at either the church in Jamestown or in Henricus. The couple lived at Rolfe's plantation on Hog Island. This plantation was located across the James River from Jamestown. They had one child, Thomas Rolfe. His birthdate and birthplace are not known. He could have been born in either America or England. The marriage created peace between the colonists and Powhatan's confederacy of tribes for years.\nTrip to England.\nThe English wanted to promote investment in the colony. Pocahontas was taken to England in 1616 with a few Indians. She served as a symbol of the tamed New World \"savage\", and the success of the settlement. John Smith did not meet Pocahontas in London, but he urged Queen Anne to treat her with the respect due a visitor. He suggested that if she were treated, she might spurn Christianity. In addition, England might lose the chance to gain a kingdom through her means. Pocahontas was then treated to events, balls and entertainments, and the company of well ladies.\nThe Bishop of London entertained her with pomp beyond what he offered to other ladies. Although Pocahontas was not a princess, she was presented as a princess to the public. Many English at this time recognized Powhatan to be the ruler of an empire, and they accorded to his daughter what they considered status. The cleric Samuel Purchas recalled meeting Pocahontas in London. He wrote that she impressed those she met by her bearing.\nDeath.\nIn March 1617, the Rolfes boarded a ship bound for Virginia. Pocahontas became ill. As the ship approached Gravesend, it was obvious she was dying. She was taken to an inn on shore and died on 21 March 1617. Her funeral was held the same day at St. George's Church, Gravesend. Rolfe then set sail for Virginia. His two year old son Thomas was ill. Rolfe thought the boy would not survive a voyage. He left the boy in the care of Sir Lewis Stukely, an official at Plymouth, England. Thomas was picked up by Rolfe's brother Henry. The boy never saw his father again. Pocahontas was buried under the chancel of St. George's Church. In 1727, the church burned. The bones of Pocahontas were reburied in a grave in the churchyard. In the 1920s, attempts to identify Pocahontas's bones were unsuccessful."}

The other half of the Roman Empire became known as the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the Byzantine Empire.\nThe whole Roman Empire had been in difficulties since 190 AD when large Gothic tribes began moving into areas under Roman control. The leadership of Rome was weak and there was instability. Various power groups in the Roman armies kept trying to install their own Emperors, and murdering Emperors who belonged to other groups. This meant the invasions by the Germanic tribes were not successfully stopped.\nThe Emperor Diocletian tried to bring stability back into government by dividing the Empire into sections. These became the Western Empire which included Iberia, France, Southern Britain, Italy, North Africa and parts of Germany, and the Eastern Empire which included the Balkans, Turkey, the Levant and Egypt.\nRome ceased to be the capital from the time of the division. In 286, the capital of the Western Roman Empire became Mediolanum (modern Milan). In 402, the capital was again moved, this time to Ravenna.\nThe Fall of the Empire.\nThis division did not help the Western Empire which came under increasing invasions from the north from the Ostrogoths, Huns, Franks, Visigoths, and Burgundians. The armies were brought back towards Rome, abandoning England and France. The economy could not cope: the increased need for military spending caused inflation. The citizens were unhappy with rising taxes and rising prices.\nIn AD 398, Alaric and his Visigoths began making attacks closer and closer to the capital. By 410 he had sacked the city of Rome. In 455, the Vandals captured Rome. In 476 the Goths captured the capital.\nThe fall of the Western Roman Empire took place in 476 AD when the leader of the Goths, Odoacer, removed Emperor Romulus. He became King of Italy, and Roman control over the Empire in the west ended. By this time the Western Empire existed in name only, the Emperor no longer could use military, financial or political power."}

The ideology, named from democracy where people have a say in government actions, supports a competitive economy with money while also helping people whose jobs don't pay a lot. This makes it easier for people to support themselves in society by having more protection if they lose their jobs. Socialism places an emphasis on equal rights for everyone, and there is plenty of government ownership or regulation of various industries that make companies play by the government's rules. This way of governing is appreciated by people living in countries who have to battle the cold more than others, like the northern Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Iceland. The ideology's movement has seen some interest in other countries whose systems do not work this way, because it has worked well for those who have it. \nDespite a common belief that social democracy is socialist by principle, its policies keep capitalism in place and socialists often dislike social democrats. Social democrats support Keynesian economics, where the government should step in and help people without jobs. In social democracy entrepreneurs own the industries just like they would in a standard capitalist economy. In socialism the workers own them instead which is very different.\nPractice versus theory.\nIn practice no political theory works out in a simple way. The Soviet Union and its various satellites are a good example. The workers did not own either their place of work or their own homes, in any meaningful way. \nNeither were capitalist systems empty of help for the poor and the needy. A good example is England, where relief for the poor was available in every parish in the land, long before there were any government social services. The practice was known as charity. Also, Britain saw the growth of an important middle class after industrialisation took hold. So it is not right to think of such societies as simply composed of owners and workers, or rich and poor.\nSocial democrats are divided in how they see their theory. Terms like \"market socialism\" and \"the third way\" are efforts to rethink what social democracy means today."}

In 2004, the new borough's districts were rearranged. The former borough of Charlottenburg was divided into the localities of Westend, Charlottenburg-Nord and Charlottenburg.

In 1701, Frederick became the first Prussian King (Frederick I of Prussia), and he made the building much bigger\nJust after the death of Sophie Charlotte, the village near the palace was called 'Charlottenburg' and the palace itself \"Schloss Charlottenburg\", and the settlement was chartered as a town. The king was the town's mayor until Lietzow was incorporated into Charlottenburg in 1720.\nFrederick's successor, Frederick William I of Prussia, rarely stayed at the palace. Frederick William even tried to end the town's privileges. It was not until 1740, at the coronation of his successor Frederick II (Frederick the Great), that the town's became important again. The eastern New Wing was built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1740 and 1747 as Frederick the Great's home. Later, Frederick II preferred the palace of Sanssouci, which he had partly designed himself.\nWhen Frederick II died in 1786, his nephew Frederick William II succeeded him, and Charlottenburg became his favourite residence, as it was for his son and successor Frederick William III.\nAfter the defeat of the Prussian army at Jena in 1806, Charlottenburg was occupied by the French. Napoleon occupied the palace, while his troops camped nearby.\nRecreational and residential area.\nIn the late 18th century, Charlottenburg's development did not depend only on the crown. The town became a recreational area for the expanding city of Berlin. Its first real inn opened in the 1770s, in the street then called 'Berliner Stra\u00dfe' (now Otto-Suhr-Allee), and many other inns and beer gardens were to follow, popular for weekend parties especially.\nSights.\nBeside the palace, Charlottenburg is also home to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on the Breitscheidplatz, the fomer West Berlin landmark, the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and the Zoo railway station as well as the Deutsche Oper Berlin, one of the three Berlin opera houses.\nTwin towns.\nCharlottenburg is twinned with"}

Until the Berlin Wall fell, these were the last two numbers of the postal codes for the two areas.\nIt was a separate borough from 1920, when it became a part of Gro\u00df-Berlin, until the borughs were changed in 2001. Then it was joined with Friedrichshain to form the new borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Since these two localities are linked only by a single bridge over the Spree river, the Oberbaumbr\u00fccke, this joining seemed awkward to many residents. The two areas could not agree on where the new borough's town hall should be. Friedrichshain was chosen by tossing a five-Mark coin.\nSummary.\nKreuzberg is known to many for numerous Turkish immigrants from eastern parts of Turkey, and the yearly May Day riots. This is because before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Kreuzberg was isolated. Its eastern parts were almost entirely surrounded by the Wall. This area consequently had cheap rents and lower-income families as well as squatters from the radical left. The western part of Kreuzberg also bordered onto the wall, and it was here where Checkpoint Charlie was.\nHistory.\nKreuzberg got its name is from its highest point, the Kreuzberg (literally, \"cross hill\"). It is of above sea level.. The hill was a traditional place for weekend trips, and had a lot of small restaurants for the visitors. The hill got its name from a monument built in 1821 by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. It was to remember the wars against Napoleon I of France.\nAfter 1860 industry began moving into Kreuzburg. There was also an \"Exportviertel\" (export quarter) along Ritterstra\u00dfe which had a lot of many profitable small businesses, and the \"press quarter\" along Kochstra\u00dfe was the home of most of Germany's large newspapers as well as the Ullstein, Scherl, and Mosse book publishers.\nBoth of these industrial quarters were almost entirely destroyed during World War II, with the bombings of a single night from 3 February 1945. To remember old tradition, the Axel Springer press company built its new headquarters at Kochstra\u00dfe again, right next to the Berlin Wall.\nAfter World War II, Kreuzberg's housing rents were regulated by law, which made investments unattractive. As a result, housing was of low quality, but cheap, which made the borough a prime target for immigrants coming to Germany (and Berlin)."}

To prevent this from happening again, the government created the Superhero Registration Act (SRA). This was a law that forced all people with superhuman powers to identify them self to the government. Many superheroes believed this was a good thing and that it would save lives. Others believed it was bad. They felt that if the government knew who they were, they would be in danger of others finding out. They believed that the SRA took away many of their freedoms.

They are run by local ambulance services, known in England and Wales as \"trusts\". Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have one ambulance service each; the Scottish Ambulance Service (a Special Health Board), the Welsh Ambulance Service, and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service. England is divided into ten regional ambulance services.\nJob of the Ambulance Services.\nNHS ambulance services must by law answer four types of requests for care, which are:\nThe ambulance services have getting more and more busy. There has been a big increase in the number calls in the last two decades, as shown in the table below:\nThe ambulance service's work has also been getting more complicated. In the past, the main job of an ambulance was to take people to hospital. This led to ambulance services being nicknamed the \"Big White Taxi Service\". Nowadays, ambulance staff do far more treatment with the patient. It is now common for patients to be left at home after being treated.\nA similar service is 111. This is a phone number for non-emergency medical advice. Many ambulance services employ the staff who answer 111 calls. In some cases, an ambulance may be sent to a 111 call if it is found to be more serious than expected.\nAmbulance trusts may also carry out non-urgent patient transport services. This is done through a business agreement with local healthcare organisations. This service is free for patients to use. In some place private companies do this job instead, but it can be a big source of money for the trusts.\nAmbulance services.\nBefore 1974 local councils would run the ambulance service. In 1974, they were merged into larger agencies that covered one or more counties. On 1 July 2006 the number of ambulance trusts fell from 29 to 13 and they were replaced by regional services.\nEngland.\nEach of the 9 government regions of England are covered by a single NHS ambulance trust, with the exception of the South East region. This region is split between the South Central and South East Coast ambulance trusts, while the Isle of Wight has a special arrangement in which local hospitals provide the ambulance service.\nScotland.\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service is a Special Health Board funded directly by the Health Department of the Scottish Government. In 2006 the service answered over 520,000 emergency calls.\nScotland also has Britain's only government-funded Air Ambulance service. It has two Eurocopter EC 135 helicopters (based in Glasgow &amp; Inverness) and two Beechcraft B200C King Air planes (based at Glasgow &amp; Aberdeen).\nNorthern Ireland.\nThe Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) is the ambulance service that serves the whole of Northern Ireland, and was set up in 1995.\nAs with other ambulance services in the United Kingdom, it does not charge its patients directly for its services, but is funded through tax.\nNIAS has over 270 ambulances and over 1,000 staff, based across 32 stations &amp; sub-stations, 4 Control Centres and a Regional Training Centre.\nWales.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust (Welsh:\"Ymddiriedolaeth GIG Gwasanaethau Ambiwlans Cymru\") was set up on April 1, 1998 and has 2,500 staff providing ambulance and related services to the 2.9 million residents of Wales.\nIts headquarters are at the HM Stanley Hospital, St Asaph, Denbighshire and it is divided into three regions:\nPrivate Ambulance Services.\nPrivate ambulance services are becoming more common in the UK. They often provide medical cover at large events, either with, or instead of the voluntary sector providers. Some organisers use a private firm instead of a voluntary ambulance service because of wider availability during the week (sometimes difficult for a voluntary service to cover) or for a wider range of skills, such as provision of qualified Paramedics.\nThe most common use for private ambulances is for non-urgent patient transport. Many trusts and hospitals have chosen to use a private company for these tasks. NHS ambulance services may also pay the private ambulances to answer some of their 999 calls.\nAll ambulance companies and the NHS Ambulance trusts must follow the same laws, so a private ambulance must have the same equipment and same type of staff working in it.\nVoluntary Ambulance Services.\nIn most of the United Kingdom, the main voluntary ambulance services are the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance. In Scotland, the main voluntary ambulance is St Andrew's First Aid. The Order of Malta Ambulance Corps. can sometimes be found in Northern Ireland also. These groups have been providing both emergency and non-emergency medical cover in the UK for over 120 years, including active service in both World Wars. This is before any government organised service.\nThe main activity of the organisations apart from training and education, is providing ambulance cover at events, as an extension of their first aid contract.\nThey may also treat and transport certain categories of patient to hospital, although for more serious incidents, such as cardiac arrest it is likely that they would call on the ambulance service. This is arranged through agreements with the local ambulance service.\nBoth organisations also provide 'reserve' or 'support' cover to some, though not all, of the ambulance trusts (dependent on the local MOU), where ambulance crews from one of the organisations (who are usually volunteers, but in some instances may be paid staff) will attend 999, GP Urgent or PTS calls on behalf of the ambulance trust. In these cases the organisation is paid by the trust. This service is most often called on during major incidents, when there is a high level of staff absence or when there is an unusually high call volume, although in some areas, voluntary crews are regularly used to supplement full-time trust cover.\nBoth organisations have also provided cover for the public when NHS ambulance trust staff have held strikes or walk outs."}

However the Mexican army was defeated and Santa Anna was captured at a battle near the site of Houston. The new republic did not have an easy time. It did not have a proper government, or any money. Its borders were often raided by Mexico, and there was fighting between the settlers and the Native Americans. The US government did not recognize the Republic of Texas.\nIn 1841, Santa Anna again became president of Mexico and the border attacks increased. By this time, thousands of new settlers had moved into Texas, and people in the US supported the people of Texas.

To get support, Schuschnigg allowed socialists and communists to appear in public again. The parties had been banned on 12 February 1934, during the Austrian Civil War. The communists said that they supported the Austrian government. The socialists wanted more promises from Schuschnigg before they were willing to side with him.\nIndependence plebiscite.\nOn 9 March, Schuschnigg announced a plebiscite on the independence of Austria for 13 March.\nTo help him win, Schuschnigg set the minimum voting age at 24. Those who supported Nazism and union with Germany tended to be young and so the move stopped them from voting.\nAlso, supporters of independence were given ballots at the polls, but opponent had to bring their own.\nHitler said that the plebiscite would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would not accept it. Also, the German Ministry of Propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and many Austrians were calling for German troops to restore order. Schuschnigg immediately said publicly that the reports of riots were false.\nHitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March to hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis or face an invasion.\nSchuschnigg resigned as chancellor that evening since he could not persuade France or the United Kingdom to help.\nIn a radio broadcast, he announced his resignation, said that he accepted the changes and allowed the Nazis to take over the government to avoid bloodshed.\nMeanwhile, Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas refused to appoint Seyss-Inquart as chancellor and asked other Austrian politicians instead. However, the Nazis were well organised, and within hours, managed to take control of many parts of Vienna, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which controlled the police. As Miklas continued to refuse to appoint a Nazi government, and Seyss-Inquart still could not send a telegram in the name of the Austrian government to demand German troops to restore order, Hitler became furious. At about 10 p.m., well after Hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion, G\u00f6ring and Hitler gave up on waiting and sent a forged telegram that pretended to be a request by the Austrian government for German troops to enter Austria. Around midnight, after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into Nazi hands in Vienna, and the main party members of the old government had been arrested, Miklas finally appointed Seyss-Inquart as chancellor.\nGerman troops march into Austria.\nOn the morning of 12 March, the 8th Army of the German Wehrmacht crossed the German-Austrian border. It was not stopped by the Austrian Army, but its troops were greeted by cheering Austrian Germans with Hitler salutes, Nazi flags and flowers.\nThe annexation of Austria without a shot being fired is therefore sometimes called the \"Blumenkrieg\" (war of flowers).\nHitler's car crossed the border in the afternoon at Braunau, his birthplace. In the evening, he arrived at Linz and was welcomed at the city hall. Goering, in a telephone call that evening, said, \"There is unbelievable jubilation in Austria. We ourselves did not think that sympathies would be so intense.\"\nOn 2 April 1938, 200,000 Austrians gathered on the Heldenplatz (Square of Heroes) to hear Hitler proclaim the Anschluss. Hitler later commented, \"Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators.\"\nThe Anschluss was given immediate effect by a law on 13 March that was subject to ratification by a plebiscite. Austria became the province of Ostmark, and Seyss-Inquart was appointed as its governor. The plebiscite was held on 10 April and officially recorded a support of 99.73% of the voters.\nMost historians agree that the result was not fixed even though the voting process was neither free nor secret. Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand, unlike a free vote in which the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box. In some parts of Austria, the plebiscite on 13 March was held despite the Wehrmacht's presence in Austria since it took up to three days to occupy every part of Austria. For instance, in Innervillgraten, 95% of the village voted for Austria's independence.\nAustria remained part of the Third Reich until the end of World War II, when a provisional government declared the Anschluss \"null und nichtig\" (null and void) on April 27 1945. After the war, the Allies occupied Austria, which was recognised and treated as a separate country, but sovereignty was restored only by the Austrian State Treaty and the Austrian Declaration of Neutrality, both in 1955, largely because of the rapid development of the Cold War and disputes between the Soviet Union and its former allies over foreign policy."}

It was made by CCP Games. The game is very similar to the 1980s game ELITE. Players in EVE earn money called \"InterStella Kredits\" (ISK) to buy new spacecraft, skills or equipment. Several ways to earn ISK include mining, exploration, doing missions, trading, piracy, and bounty hunting (hunting criminals for money). \nEVE is hosted on 1 server cluster. Unlike most MMORPG games, it is not split up based upon geographical location or how busy the servers are. \nRaces in Eve.\nThere are four races in the Eve universe that are playable by subscribers, there is a fifth race, but only Eve Online employees can get them.\nAmarr\nThe Amarr is a race centered around religion. They were the first of the four races to develop ships capable of travelling space. Their main weapon type is a laser, which fire high-energy beams to the enemy to deal damage. They do not use ammunition like the other races, but instead use a type of ammunition called a crystal in order to focus the laser. There are two subgroups of lasers: Beam (long range), and Pulse (short range).\nCaldari\nThe Caldari is a race centered around corporations. They are a very military driven race, and specialize in both missiles and hybrid turrets (which require both ammunition to fire, and energy to fire it), railguns in particular, and can shoot further than other races.\nGallente\nThe Gallente happened to be located in the same place the Caldari were, and were the first race to create a democracy. Like the Caldari, they specialize in hybrid turrets, but prefer the short-ranged \"blasters\", and do not specialize in missiles, instead using drones (small robot ships) to good effect.\nMinmatar\nThe Minmatar was the last race to develop space flight. The Amarr quickly enslaved them, however they were able to gain their freedom with the help of the Gallente. Their main weapon is projectile turrets, pretty much regular guns, with the subgroup being artillery (long range), and auto-cannons (short range).\nGameplay.\nGameplay in Eve is known to be complex, since there are so many things for a player to do. A player can do many things, with three of the main categories being:\nMissions\nMissions involves talking with an NPC (computer player), who will assign you with a task. This can include: killing other NPCs, hauling an item from one location to another, or a combination of both. The rewards from doing these missions include money, standings (better standings means you can do better missions), and Loyalty Points (which can be spent to get certain types of items that can not normally be bought.\nMining/Industry\nMining and Industry are the backbone of the Eve Universe. Almost everything that a player flies, or item he uses was made by another player. Except for certain items, everything is made through industry. There are certain ores (which give minerals when refined) that can only be found in certain areas. Players that find these ores and bring them back to the market will be sure to make quite a bit of money.\nPVP\nAlthough PVP (player-vs-player fights) is not a very good way to make money for new players, it is by far one of the most exciting things to do in the Eve Universe. The Eve industry is primarily focused around providing ships to PVP players. Many big corporations (groups of players that share a common goal), can form gigantic alliances to take control of certain areas, which are rich in a wide variety of ways. "}

Veritas and Undina would have been the biggest pieces of that collision.\nThe thought Veritas collision would have been too far from Jupiter for the pieces to have been slung into a collision course with Earth. However, solar radiation would have caused the resulting dust to drift inward to Earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment.\nToday continuing collisions among Veritas-family asteroids are estimated to send five thousand tons of cosmic dust to Earth each year, 15% of the total.\nIt was found by Max Wolf in 1902.

Sey\u00df-Inquart was executed at the Nuremberg Trials for crimes against humanity.\nLife before the Anschluss.\nSey\u00df-Inquart was born in 1892 in Stona\u0159ov (\"Stannern\"), Moravia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to school principal Emil Zajtich and his wife Auguste Hyrenbach. The family moved to Vienna in 1907, where they changed the Czech Slavic name of \"Zajtich\" to the German \"Sey\u00df-Inquart\". Sey\u00df-Inquart later studied law at the University of Vienna. At the beginning of World War I in August 1914, Sey\u00df-Inquart enlisted in the Austrian Army and served in Russia, Romania and Italy. He was decorated for bravery on a number of occasions, and while recovering from wounds in 1917 he completed his final examinations for his degree.\nIn 1911, Sey\u00df-Inquart met Gertrud Maschka. The couple married in 1916 and had three children: Ingeborg Caroline Auguste Sey\u00df-Inquart (born 18 September 1917), Richard Sey\u00df-Inquart (born 1921) and Dorothea Sey\u00df-Inquart (born 1928).\nHe went into law after the war, and in 1921 set up his own practice. During the early years of the first Austrian republic, he was close to the Vaterl\u00e4ndische Front.\nAs a successful lawyer, he was asked to join the cabinet of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933.\nHe became a State Councillor in 1937 under Kurt Schuschnigg. He was not a member of the Austrian National Socialist party at first. But by 1938, Sey\u00df-Inquart was the highest-ranking politician in the Austrian National Socialist Party.\nIn February 1938, Sey\u00df-Inquart was appointed Minister of the Interior by Schuschnigg, after Hitler had threatened Schuschnigg. On 11 March 1938, Schuschnigg resigned as Austrian Chancellor and Sey\u00df-Inquart was appointed to the position by Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas. Hitler's plan was to have Sey\u00df-Inquart send a telegram asking for German help to stop riots, but President Miklas did not make Sey\u00df-Inquart chancellor until after Hitler's invasion of Austria. On 13 March 1938, Sey\u00df-Inquart joined the National Socialist party.\nHead of Ostmark and Southern Poland.\nHitler was going to leave Austria independent, but after the welcome the invading German troops got during the Anschlu\u00df he decided to make Austria a new part of the Third Reich, called \"Ostmark\" (or \"eastern boundary\") . Sey\u00df-Inquart wrote the statute which made Austria a province of Germany, and signed it into law on 13 March.\nSey\u00df-Inquart became \"Reichsstatthalter\" or Governor of the so-called Ostmark. Ernst Kaltenbrunner was chief minister, and Burckel Commissioner for the Reunion of Austria (concerned with the \"Jewish Question\").\nSey\u00df-Inquart was made an SS Gruppenf\u00fchrer, and in May 1939 Minister without portfolio in Hitler's government.\nAfter the invasion of Poland Sey\u00df-Inquart became governor of Southern Poland, but before he started work there the General Government was created, and Sey\u00df-Inquart became a deputy to Governor General Hans Frank.\nReichskommissar in the Netherlands.\nAfter Germany invaded the Low Countries, Sey\u00df-Inquart became Reichskommissar for occupied Netherlands in May 1940. His job was to organize civil administration, create close economic ties with Germany and defend the interests of the Reich.\nHe supported the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB) and allowed it to create a paramilitary \"Landwacht\", as an auxiliary police force. Other political parties were banned in late 1941, and many former government officials imprisoned at Sint-Michielsgestel. The administration of the country was largely controlled by Sey\u00df-Inquart himself.\nHe introduced measures to combat 'terror', and when a widespread strike took place in Amsterdam, Arnhem and Hilversum in May 1943 special summary court-martials were held and a collective fine of 18 million guilders was imposed. Sey\u00df-Inquart authorized the execution of around 800 people before liberation. Some people say it was not merely 800 but over 1,500, including executions under the so-called \"Hostage Law\" involving (among others) political prisoners who were close to being liberated, the Putten incident, and the reprisal execution of 117 Dutchmen for the attack on SS and Police Leader\" Hanns Albin Rauter. From July 1944 on, most of Sey\u00df-Inquart's powers were transferred to the military commander in the Netherlands and the Gestapo, but he was still an important and powerful political figure.\nThere were two small concentration camps in the Netherlands:\nThere was also a \"Jewish assembly camp\" at Westerbork, in addition to a number of other camps controlled by the military, the police, the SS or Sey\u00df-Inquart's administration. These included a \"voluntary labor recruitment\" camp at Ommen. A total of around 530,000 Dutch civilians worked for the Germans, of whom 250,000 were sent to factories in Germany.\nSeyss-Inquart was an anti-Semite: within a few months of his arrival in the Netherlands, he sacked Jews from government, the press and leading positions in industry. Anti-Jewish measures escalated after 1941: approximately 140,000 Jews were registered, a ghetto was created in Amsterdam and a transit camp set up at Westerbork. In February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to the Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps. Later, Dutch Jews were sent to Auschwitz. As Allied forces approached in September 1944 the remaining Jews at Westerbork were sent to Theresienstadt. Of 140,000 registered Dutch Jews, only 44,500 survived the war.\nWhen Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945, Sey\u00df-Inquart became the Foreign Minister in Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz's new German government.\nThe Nazi regime had tried a 'scorched earth' policy, and also destroyed some docks and harbors. Sey\u00df-Inquart agreed with Armaments Minister Albert Speer that destroying everything to keep valuable materials from Allied forces or a new government after the war was wrong. Sey\u00df-Inquart also helped in the so-called 'hunger winter' of 1945 to distribute food, and allowed Allied airplanes to drop Swedish white bread for the hungry people of occupied northern Netherlands. He remained Reichskommissar until 8 May 1945, when, after a meeting with Karl D\u00f6nitz to confirm his blocking of the scorched-earth orders, he was captured in Hamburg.\nNuremberg Trials.\nAt the Nuremberg Trials, Sey\u00df-Inquart faced charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, starting and fighting wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity.\nHis defence lawyer was Gustav Steinbauer. Sey\u00df-Inquart was nonetheless found guilty of all charges except conspiracy. On hearing of his death sentence, Seyss-Inquart made it clear he accepted responsibility for excesses during the war, \"Death by hanging...well, in view of the whole situation, I never expected anything different. It's all right\". He was hanged on 16 October 1946, at the age of 54, together with nine other Nuremberg defendants. His last words were \"I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples. I believe in Germany\"."}

Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes, after the tyranny of the Peistratids and the rule of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC. Athens was one of the most powerful cities in ancient times. It was important because there democracy developed.\nIn 477 B.C. Athens began the Delian League to join the city-states for protection. Their rival was the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. The Delian League's money was kept in the temple of Apollo.\nIn the classical period, Athens was a center for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's \"Akademia\" and Aristotle's \"Lyceum\". Athens was also the birthplace of Socrates, Pericles, Sophocles, and other philosophers, writers and politicians of the ancient world. It is widely referred to as the cradle of western civilization, and the birthplace of democracy. Its culture and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC had widespread effects.\nThe classical period is usually dealt with by its most important political events, as follows:\nWars.\nPersian War.\nWhen King Xerxes of Persia fought the Greeks of Asia Minor, Athens helped the Greeks in Asia Minor. In time, the Persians attacked Greece and the Greco-Persian wars began.\nOn the plain of Marathon, many Persians with bows and arrows fought the Greeks. Even though there were many more Persians than Greeks, the Greeks won because they had spears and swords of metal.\nThemistocles, the general of Athens, warned the Athenians that the Persians would return, so they should make their navy bigger. The people did so, and Sparta offered to help. In 480 BC the Persians arrived and attacked the Greeks, both on land and on sea. The Persians won the battle of Thermopylae, but the battle gave the Greeks time to get ready.\nAlthough the city of Athens was burnt down, most of the people had run away to the nearby islands for safety. Themistocles ordered the Greeks to prepare for another attack. This time he told them to leave their ships in the Bay of Salamis. When the Persians arrived, they were surprised and confused by the harbor that was so full of ships they could not travel in it. In this battle of Salamis a few hundred Greek ships destroyed many, many Persian ships. Xerxes went away.\nThe next year, 32,000 Greek hoplites and 50,000 other soldiers won the Battle of Plataea. The Persians did not attack Greece again.\nPeloponnesian War.\nEven though Sparta and Athens helped each other in battle, they were very different culturally. In 431 to 404 B.C., these two city-states fought in a conflict called the Peloponnesian War after the name of the lower part of the peninsula. Sparta had help from other states. Many people died in the siege of Athens because of a terrible sickness, including Pericles.\nIn 405, the Spartans destroyed the navy of Athens in battle. Athens surrendered to Sparta in the following year.\nFor 30 years Sparta ruled, but many people did not like Spartan government, and Thebes, another city-state, helped Athens defeat Sparta. For nine years Thebes was the most powerful state.\nHowever, Greece was much weaker because of the wars inside her country. Philip of Macedonia began to move into Greek territory. Although Demosthenes warned Athens of the danger, Athenians did not care. At Chaeronea, Philip of Macedonia controlled Greece.\nWhen Philip died, his son, Alexander the Great, even though he was only 20 years, went out to capture the world. He won Asia Minor, Persia, Egpyt, and a small part of India, but he died of sickness when he was 32.\nLifestyle.\nThe people in Athens ate simply, usually barley cakes, onions, fish, and fruit. For clothes the men wore short pieces of cloth (tunics), aprons, and sandals for work. A woman wore a \"chiton\", which was a long, loose cloth that was attached to the shoulder. The loose garment was like a blouse because of a rope worn around the waist. Sandals were made by putting the foot on a piece of skin while the shoemaker made a covering for the foot.\nChildren liked to have pet rabbits and to play ball games. For fun, they also raced little chariots pulled by dogs. They were taught by slaves, and learned poetry, music, and dancing. Exercise was also important.\nWhen a young man became 18, he began two years of training for the army. After that he could join in the men's classes where javelin throwing was done. For protection in wrestling, he tied leather strips around his wrists. He also cut his hair. Teachers from many lands taught the young men.\nThe Greek hoplites fought close together in a phalanx formation. Their spears were very long.\nWomen in classical Athens.\nWomen in ancient and classical Athens were treated with little respect. They could not become citizens of Athens. This means they could not vote and did not have any direct say in what happened in Athens. They could not run for election.\nGirls could not be citizens. They left their home at the age of 14 to get married, sometimes with a man who was much older than she was (about 30 years old). Her marriage would be arranged by her father. On most occasions, the father would pick a rich husband for his daughter. The girl and her mother had no say in who she married, it was entirely the father's choice.\nContrast that with Sparta. Spartan women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, \"women took responsibility for running estates\".\nin the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. They controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army. Spartan women rarely married before the age of 20, and unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore short dresses and went where they pleased. Girls as well as boys received an education. Young women as well as young men may have taken part in the \"Gymnopaedia\" (\"Festival of Nude Youths\")."}

It tells the story of rabbits and their adventures concerning their warren at a hill in the north of Hampshire, England known as Watership Down.\nIn this fantasy book, rabbits with human intelligence are shown in their natural environment. They have their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry and mythology.\nIt was first published in the United Kingdom by Rex Collings Ltd in 1972 and has continued to be printed and is now available in 18 different languages.\nStory.\nFiver, a rabbit with a gift for seeing the future, living at Sandleford Warren, sees his home being destroyed by a land developer in the future. He convinces his brother, Hazel to talk to the Chief Rabbit, Threarah about leaving the Warren, however, the Chief Rabbit has no intention of leaving. Hazel, Fiver, and nine other rabbits then set off in search of a new home (at the time, merely off of the basis of Fiver's dreams that a good home awaits them somewhere far away).\nThey travel through forests, fields, over rivers, and roads filled with hrududu's (cars) before tiredness forces them to stop at a warren headed by a rabbit named Cowslip. After much debate, the rabbits agree to stay at Cowslips warren. The warren however, feels wrong to them (especially Fiver) due to the other rabbit's strange customs.\nThey soon find out that the strange actions that Cowslip's rabbits are showing is due to the fact that they are merely being fed and taken care of by a farmer so that he kill them off, one by one, for food. They leave Cowslip's warren, although Bigwig nearly dies on the way.\nThey keep going until they arrive at the site of Watership Down, a high hill that is far from man and full of good food and safety. After a day or two at their good land that Fiver had promised them, Hazel is named the unofficial chief rabbit of Watership Down. However, Hazel realizes that there are no does (female rabbits) among them, and they cannot have a healthy warren of rabbits without does.\nHazel later rescues a big gull named Kehaar, who has been hurt by a cat. After nursing Kehaar back to health, Keharr agrees to help the rabbits for the time being in return for their kindness toward him. After being asked by Hazel to check out of the area, Kehaar finds a large warren called Efrafa to the South of their position. After hearing that Efrafa is large and too crowded, Hazel sends four rabbits to Efrafa to ask if they could bring back some does to their warren.\nHowever, Efrafa, being a large warren with too many rabbits, is tightly controlled by a rabbit named General Woundwort and his large military. Each rabbit is told when are where they are allowed to eat, sleep and more. Nothing happens without the General's ok, including leaving the warren. The four rabbits barely run away after playing a trick on an Efrafan Captain.\nAt the same time that the four rabbits are at Efrafa, Hazel leads a small group to look into Kehaar's report that there is a farm with a few caged rabbits, including does. After a few raids, the Watership rabbits break a few caged rabbits out of the farm, but Hazel is shot on the way out. Fiver has a vision where Hazel is, though, and Hazel is found and returned to health.\nNow hearing how Efrafa is, the weakened Hazel decides to free the rabbits from Efrafa. All of the Watership rabbits travel carefully to the edges of Efrafa. Pretending to be a wandering alone rabbit, Bigwig infiltrates Efrafa as an officer of their Owsla. Secretly, however, Bigwig is helping get rabbits to help with the break out. He meets Hyzenthlay and Thethunninnang, two does who tell him that, if he has a working plan, they and a few other rabbits will attempt the escape with him.\nAfter nearly having to fight General Woundwort, Bigwig and the does break out of Efrafa with Kehaar's help. Of course this break out is noticed by the guards, and soon the General himself and his small army catch up Bigwig and the runaway rabbits. They get away only because Kehaar attacks Woundwort. Woundwort keep chasing the rabbits to a stream, and the rabbits escape on a small boat. Two does die on the way to Watership Down, but most rabbits make it there safely.\nThe rabbits are glad to see the new rabbits. However, a field mouse warns the rabbits that General Woundwort and a small strike team are coming. The General then attacks the warren in the night as the Watership Rabbits head to their deepest burrows, blocking off the tunnels in an attempt to hold off the Efrafans.\nWhile in a burrow, Fiver passes out as too many visions come to him at once. Meanwhile, Hazel, has a vision of how to stop the Efrafans. Hazel tells Bigwig to stay there and fight and he takes Blackberry and Dandelion out of the burrow. Hazel's plan is to use the dog at the nearby Nuthanger farm to defeat the Efrafans.\nHazel's plan works, however Bigwig and Hazel are hurt in the process. General Woundwort disappears, never to be seen again. Captain Campion and the other attackers go back to Efrafa, where Campion becomes Chief Rabbit.\nHazel lives a long life as Chief Rabbit of Watership Down, while his warren does well and is peaceful. Fiver recovers and Bigwig becomes the respected captain of the guard."}

It started on April 17, 1794, which was soon after Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko's victory at an important battle.\nAlthough the Russian army was larger, had better weapons, and killed many Polish people, Russian soldiers started to lose a lot of land and suffered from many deaths.\nThe Polish people had been preparing to fight in the uprising since the spring of 1793. They managed to become very popular: they formed a large army of volunteers who were led by a shoemaker, Jan Kili\u0144ski. Apart from this army, the most famous group to take part in giving the Polish people their freedom were the Poles who had been forced to join the Russian army. A person who watched the fighting was a French artist, Jan Piotr Norblin, who drew pictures of the uprising."}

He carries an umbrella as a sign of his power. He is also sometimes shown with a mongoose, often shown spitting out jewels. The mongoose is the enemy of the snake, which is a symbol of greed or hatred; the spitting out of jewels shows generosity.\nVai\u015brava\u1e47a in Therav\u0101da tradition.\nIn the P\u0101li writings of the Therav\u0101da Buddhist tradition, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is called Vessava\u1e47a. Vessava\u1e47a is one of the Four Great Kings, each one of which rules over a direction. Vessava\u1e47a's direction is the northern quarter of the world.\nVessava\u1e47a has the name \"Kuvera\" from a name he had from a past life as a rich mill-owner, who gave all the money he got from one of his seven mills to charity, and gave aid to the poor for 20,000 years.\nAs with all the Buddhist deities, Vessava\u1e47a is properly the name of a person who has the god inside him rather than a permanent individual. Each Vessava\u1e47a is a human, and when he dies, he will be replaced by a new Vessava\u1e47a. Like other beings of the C\u0101tummah\u0101r\u0101jika world, his lifespan is 90,000 years, but other sources say nine million years.\nWhen the Buddha was born, Vessava\u1e47a became his follower. He often brought the Buddha and his followers messages from the gods and other humans, and protected them.\nVai\u015brava\u1e47a in Japan.\nIn Japan, Bishamonten (\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929), or just Bishamon (\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580) is thought of as a god of war or warriors who wears armor, and a punisher of people who do evil things, a view that is very strange when compared with the more peaceful Buddhist king described above. Bishamon is shown holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand. The Pagoda symbolises the divine treasure house, which holds things that he guards and gives away. In Japanese folklore, he is one of the Japanese Seven Lucky Gods.\nVai\u015brava\u1e47a in Tibet.\nIn Tibet, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is known to be a worldly protector of the Dharma. He is also known as the King of the North. As guardian of the north, he is often shown on temple wall paintings outside the main door. He is also a god of wealth. Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is sometimes shown carrying a citron, the fruit of the \"jambhara\" tree. The fruit helps pick him out from depictions of Kuvera."}

Brendan Canty, who played drums, was also in Rites of Spring. For Joe Lally, it was his first major band.\nStyle of music.\nFugazi are known for their aggressive, \"chunky\" music.

Worship of Benzaiten arrived in Japan in the 6th to 8th centuries, mainly through the Chinese translations of the \"Sutra of Golden Light \".\nHer Sanskrit name is \"Sarasvat\u00ee Dev\u00ee\", which means \"flowing water\". This is why Benzaiten is the goddess of everything that flows: water, words, speech, and music. The characters used to write her name showed her as the goddess of eloquence. Because of the Sutra of Golden Light, in Japan she became a protector of the people. Lastly, she became one of the Seven Lucky Gods.\nIn the Rig-Veda (6.61.7) Sarasvati killed the three-headed snake, also known as Vritra. This is probably one of the sources of Sarasvati/Benzaiten's close link with snakes and dragons in Japan. She has a shrine on the Island of Enoshima in Sagami Bay, about 50 kilometers south of Tokyo; and a five-headed dragon and her are the main people in the Enoshima Engi, a history of the shrines on Enoshima written by the Japanese Buddhist monk Kokei (\u7687\u6176). According to Kokei, Benzaiten is the third daughter of the dragon-king of Munetsuchi (\u7121\u71b1\u6c60; literally \"lake without heat\"), the lake which is at the center of the world in an ancient Buddhist view.

{"id": "87932", "revid": "7663838", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87932", "title": "Purchasing power parity", "text": "There are two ways to measure GDP (total income of a country) of different countries and compare them. One way, called GDP at exchange rate, is when the currencies of all countries are converted into USD (United States Dollar). The second way is GDP (PPP) or GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP).\nPPP.\nUses.\nPurchasing power parity (PPP) is measured by finding the values (in USD) of a basket of consumer goods that are present in each country (such as pineapple juice, pencils, etc.). If that basket costs $100 in the US and $200 in the United Kingdom, then the purchasing power parity exchange rate is 1:2.\nExamples.\nFor example, suppose that Japan has a higher GDP per capita (US$18) than the US (US$16). This means that the average Japanese person makes $2 more than the average American. However, this does not necessarily imply that the Japanese are more affluent. Suppose that one gallon of orange juice costs $6 in Japan, and $2 in the US, i.e. $6 buys a good in Japan that can be purchased in the US for $2. 1 gallon of orange juice is taken as a reference good in this example. Simply, 1 gallon of orange juice can be bought in Japan, versus 3 gallons in America, with an equivalent amount of money. We can calculate a PPP index for Japan vs. the US equal to 1/3. \u00a0According to orange juice prices, Americans have stronger purchasing power, or are able to buy more value with their money. The US has a PPP-adjusted GDP of $16, which has not changed since it is the reference currency. Japan's GDP, however, is only $6 when adjusted for PPP. This is calculated by multiplying Japan's unadjusted GDP by the PPP index. In reality, a much wider range of goods that includes much more than just orange juice is taken to calculate the PPP index, so that it accurately reflects the average cost of living.\nDaily life (application).\nNow apply this to daily life. The orange juice represents the previously mentioned \"basket of goods\" which represents the cost of living in a country. Therefore, even if a country has a higher GDP per capita (individual income), that country's people may still live poorer if the cost of living is higher.\nThere are some problems with how PPP is calculated using the market basket. Because people in different countries buy different goods, it can be very hard to create an accurate market basket. This means that PPP does not always represent the exact real value of money in different countries."}

He taught for over 30 years. He travels widely in Europe, America, Australia and Asia.\nHe was the founder and spiritual leader of Rigpa, which is an international network of over 100 Buddhist centres and groups in 23 countries around the world. He is also the author of the best-selling book \"The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying\", which has been printed in 30 languages and 56 countries.\nRinpoche often speaks at major conferences in all areas of society, including medicine and healing, education, dialogue between religions, movements for peace and non-violence, the world of business and leadership, and the field of serving the dying and hospice care.\nEarly life.\nSogyal Rinpoche was born in 1947 in the region of Kham in Eastern Tibet. Jamyang Khyentse Ch\u00f6kyi Lodr\u00f6 says that he is the reincarnation of Tert\u00f6n Sogyal, a teacher to the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. Jamyang Khyentse raised him as a son and made sure he got good training.\nWhen things got bad in Kham, Khyentse Rinpoche and his young student went to Central Tibet and Lhasa. In 1955, they met Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. They then went to India. They settled in Gangtok at the invitation of the king of Sikkim.\nEducation.\nRinpoche went to Catholic School in Kalimpong. Then he went to study at a university in Delhi before coming to the West. In 1971, he was granted a place to study comparative religion at Trinity College, Cambridge as a visiting scholar. He continued to study with many masters of all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, especially His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche and His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.\nControversy.\nIn 1994, a $10 million civil lawsuit was filed against Sogyal Rinpoche. It was alleged that he had used his position as a spiritual leader to induce one of his female students to have sexual relations with him. The complaint included accusations of infliction of emotional distress, breach of fiduciary duty, as well as assault and battery. The lawsuit was settled out of court. Related allegations were later introduced by journalist Mary Finnigan, who was also the main author of the original article in 1995.\nTeaching career.\nRinpoche soon began teaching in Paris. He often translated for His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche. He also went with Dudjom Rinpoche to the United States in 1976.\nIn the summer of 1977, he started a centre in London, which he called Dzogchen Orgyen Ch\u00f6ling. Many great masters taught there: Dudjom Rinpoche, His Holiness Sakya Trizin, Gyalwang Karmapa, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and others.\nIn 1979, Sogyal Rinpoche chose the name Rigpa for his work. It means \"the innermost, essential nature of mind\". Rigpa soon set up a schedule of teaching events, referred to as retreats, with Sogyal Rinpoche and other teachers, with teachings in France every summer, California at Thanksgiving, Germany in Winter, followed by Myall Lakes in Australia, and then England at Easter. The first winter event at Kirchheim in Germany took place in December 1986, retreats in Tiona Park in Australia began in 1989, and the first Thanksgiving retreat in the US was in Oakland in 1988.\nIn 1987, Rinpoche became spiritual director of the centre in County Cork in the west of Ireland which was to become Dzogchen Beara, Rigpa\u2019s first long-term retreat centre. In 1991, Sogyal Rinpoche opened the retreat centre of Lerab Ling near Montpellier in southern France. The first three-month retreat was held there in 1992. A centre in Berlin named Dharma Mati was opened in October 2007.\nAbuse allegations.\nIn 2017, a letter revealed that Rinpoche had physically and sexually abused many of his students dating back to the 1990s.\nDeath.\nRinpoche died of a pulmonary embolism caused by colorectal cancer on 28 August 2019 at a hospital in Thailand at the age of 72."}

He also studied to alchemy, divination, and Hermetic philosophy.\nDee lived during a time when people were just learning the difference between science and magic. He was one of the most learned men of his time. He lectured to crowded halls at the University of Paris when still in his early twenties. Dee was an expert in mathematics, astronomy and navigation. He trained many of those who would go on voyages of discovery for England. In fact, he coined the term \"British Empire\".\nAt the same time, he was very interested in magic and Hermetic philosophy. He spent the last third of his life studying mostly these subjects. During his time, these subjects were not thought to be opposed to science. They were thought to be part of science.\nHe wrote \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" (\"The Hieroglyphic Monad\") in 1564 (about Kabbala and alchemy). He also wrote the preface to the first English translation of Euclid's works.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nJonathan Dee ( his real name) was born in London in a Welsh family. The last name Dee cames from the Welsh word \"du\", meaning \"black\". He graduated from St. John's College, Cambridge when he was eighteen. He was a founding fellow of Trinity College. He lectured for a little while at Cambridge. Then he left England to study in continental Europe and lecture in Paris and Louvain. He returned to England in the 1540s.\nIn 1555, he was arrested and charged with practicing black magic for having cast horoscopes of Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth; the charges were expanded to treason against Mary. Dee appeared in the Star Chamber and cleared himself. When he was released, he became a scientific advisor to Queen Elizabeth One, even deciding on the best date for her to be crowned in 1558.\nHe traveled to Europe with money from Elizabeth I. He was possibly acting as a spy for her. He became a close associate of many Elizabethan explorers and entrepreneurs such as Sir Humphrey Gilbert.\nIn 1564, Dee wrote the Hermetic work \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" (\"The Hieroglyphic Monad\") about a symbol of his own design which stood for the mystical unity of all creation. This work was highly valued by many people of Dee's time. However, there was a secret about it which has been lost. This makes the book hard to understand today.\nHe published a \"Mathematical Preface\" to Henry Billingsley's English translation of Euclid's \"Elements\" in 1570. He wrote about how important mathematics was for the other arts and sciences. Because this book was written for the public, it was Dee's most popular work.\nLater life.\nDee was not satisfied with his knowledge. In the early 1580s, he started to use supernatural ways to get more knowledge. He wanted to get knowledge from the angels.\nHe met Edward Kelly in 1582 and Kelly became his companion. Kelly was a convicted forger. Kelly helped Dee to get visions from angels using a crystal ball. The angels gave them a language called Enochian and dictated several books through Kelly. Dee's crystal ball ended up in the British Museum. It went unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection. Most of the still existing papers of Dee are also in the British Museum.\nFinal years.\nIn 1583, while Dee was away in Europe, his home and library at Mortlake were destroyed by a mob. Later, Dee came to believe that many of his books had been stolen by former friends and associates. He asked Queen Elizabeth for help. She made him Warden of Christ's College, Manchester, in 1592. He remained in this position until 1604.\nWhen Queen Elizabeth One died in 1603, so did Dee's influence: he was forced to retire to his home at Mortlake where he died in poverty.\nPublication of Enochian writings.\nAbout ten years after his death, the antiquarian Robert Cotton found some of Dee writings, mostly records of Dee's communications with angels. Cotton's son gave these writings to the scholar M\u00e9ric Casaubon, who published them in 1659 as \"A True &amp; Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits.\"\nThis was the public had heard about Dee's spiritual conferences. The book was very, very, popular and sold quickly. Because Casaubon wrote in his introduction that Dee was really dealing with evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels, Dee was thought of as a fool for some time.\nPersonal life.\nDee was married three times and had eight children. His eldest son was Arthur Dee. He was also an alchemist and Hermetic writer."}

They are named after Sir Hugh Munro (1856\u20131919), who produced the first attempt at a catalogue of such hills, known as \"Munro's Tables\", in 1891.\nMunro did not set any measure of relative height by which a peak qualified as a separate mountain, and much debate has since taken place over how distinct two hills must be if they are to be considered as two separate Munros.\nDespite their modest height, walking and climbing in the Scottish mountains may be made dangerous by their latitude and exposure to Atlantic weather systems. Even in summer, conditions can be very bad; thick fog, strong winds, driving rain and freezing summit temperatures are not unusual.\nWinter ascents of certain Munros are widely accepted to provide among the most challenging ice climbs in Europe. Some walkers are unprepared for the often extreme weather conditions on the exposed tops and many fatalities are recorded every year, often resulting from slips on wet rock or ice."}

It is often known simply as prominence. Some also call it autonomous height, relative height, shoulder drop (in the United States), or prime factor (in Europe). It is \"the elevation difference between the summit and the lowest contour line encircling it and no higher summit\".\nTwo related concepts in topography are col and parent peak. These are used to calculate the prominence. The parent peak is a higher mountain that is often (but not always) nearby. It is chosen using a variety of criteria. The col is the lowest point between two peaks. There may be several cols between a peak and its parent peak, since other peaks may be between the two. The highest of these cols is known as the key col. Prominence is measured as the difference in height between the summit and the key col."}

It was invented by Russian inventor L\u00e9on Theremin in October 1920 after the outbreak of the Russian civil war. Its invention grew out of a search for ways to detect movement. It was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched. The control section has two metal antennae to sense the positions of the player's hands. One hand controls the pitch. The other hand controls the volume. To play the theremin, the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.\nThe sound of the theremin is associated with \"alien,\" surreal, and eerie-sounding portamento, glissando, tremolo, and vibrato sounds. It has been used in film soundtracks such as \"Spellbound\", \"The Lost Weekend\", \"Ed Wood\", \"Mars Attacks!\" and \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". The BBC Radiophonic Workshop used the theramin to provide the electronic sounds in demand in the mid-century. Theremins are also used in art music (especially avant-garde and 20th century \"new music\") and in popular music genres such as rock and pop. The Russian Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces, including a use in his score for the 1931 film \"Odna\"."}
