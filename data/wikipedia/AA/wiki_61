The Council chose Phillip Saunders as its first chief of police. He was in charge of a force with six patrolmen and one lieutenant, at a time when the population of Portland was 9,000. The first member of the force to die in the line of duty was Officer Charles F. Schoppe, who was shot to death in 1874 while trying to disarm a drunken saloon customer. On April 1, 1908, the Bureau became the first in the United States to hire a female police officer, Lola Baldwin, who became the Superintendent of its newly created Women\u2019s Protective Division. In 1915, the \"Metropolitan Police Force\" changes its name to the Bureau of Police. Four years later, the Bureau becomes the first in the USA to use police radio. In 1985, Penny Harrington becomes Portland\u2019s first woman Chief of Police, and the first to head a major U.S. police department."}

In addition to the cranium, an upper jaw from another individual, a sacrum (bone of the pelvis), a tibia, and two femur fragments were also found.\nRhodesian Man is dated to be between 125,000 and 300,000 years old. Cranial capacity of the Broken Hill skull has been estimated at 1,100\u00a0cm\u00b3. Bada &amp; al (1974) published a direct date of 110 ka for this specimen. The brain size is rather small for such a late date. The destruction of the paleoanthropological site has made layered dating impossible.\nThe skull is from an extremely robust (= strong) individual, and has the comparatively largest brow-ridges of any known hominid remains. It was described as having a broad face similar to \"Homo neanderthalensis\" (i.e. large nose and thick protruding brow ridges), and has been interpreted as an \"African Neanderthal\". There are several features intermediate between modern \"Homo sapiens\" and Neanderthals. Most current experts believe Rhodesian Man to be within the group of \"Homo heidelbergensis\". Other names, such as Archaic \"Homo sapiens\" and \"Homo sapiens rhodesiensis\", have also been suggested."}
{"id": "203521", "revid": "844779", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203521", "title": "Homo georgicus", "text": "Homo georgicus is a species of \"Homo\" that was proposed in 2002. It is based on fossil skulls and jaws found in Dmanisi, Georgia in 1999 and 2001, which seem intermediate between \"Homo habilis\" and \"H. erectus\".\nA partial skeleton was discovered in 2001. The fossils are about 1.8 million years old. The remains were first discovered in 1991 by Georgian scientist, David Lordkipanidze, accompanied by an international team which unearthed the remains. Implements and animal bones were found alongside the ancient human remains.\nAt first, scientists thought they had found mandibles and skulls belonging to \"Homo ergaster\", but size differences led them to name a new species.\nInterpretations.\nSmall skull.\nAt around 600 cm\u00b3 brain volume, the skull D2700 is dated to 1.77 million years old and it is in good condition. The cranium was the smallest and most primitive Hominin skull ever discovered outside of Africa.\nIn Africa, the \"Australopithecines\" and early \"Homo\" represent two distinctive evolutionary paths sharing a common ancestor. In Georgia the specimens, with a brain half the size of anatomically modern humans, were the smallest found until the discovery of \"Homo floresiensis\" on the island of Flores in 2003.\nThere is a strong sexual dimorphism present, with males being significantly larger than females. This is a primitive trait, less obvious in more recent human species in Europe (i.e. \"Homo antecessor\", \"Homo heidelbergensis\" and \"Homo neanderthalensis\").\nThe small size of this species contrasts with the much larger size of \"Homo erectus\". \"H. georgicus\" was the first species of \"Homo\" to settle in Europe, some 800,000 years before \"H. erectus\".\nLater, four fossil skeletons were found, showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between \"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo erectus\", and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. The assemblage includes one of the largest Pleistocene Homo mandibles (D2600), one of the smallest Lower Pleistocene mandibles (D211), a nearly complete sub-adult (D2735), and a specimen without teeth (D3900).\nClassification.\n\"H. georgicus\" is often classified as Homo erectus georgicus. The classical textbook definition of \"H. erectus\" included a brain size range of between 9001150 ccs. If the \"georgicus\" specimens and the Flores specimens (\"Homo floresiensis\") are included in \"H. erectus\", then the range of brain capacities is two-fold, from 600 ccs to 1150 ccs. \"Homo ergaster\" is also considered by some to be a subspecies of \"H. erectus\". Size has something to do with it: both the \"georgicus\" and \"floriensis\" were much smaller than the classic \"erectus\", which was as tall as modern man. The classification of all these species or subspecies is provisional at present, and still being debated."}

Some scientists believe that the Chicxulub crater was made by the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and many other animals. It is partly in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico and partly underwater.\nThe Chicxulub crater is more than 180\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) in diameter, making it the third largest confirmed impact crater. Petroleum prospectors found it in the late 1970s.\nThe bolide which formed the crater was at least 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) in diameter. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. The age of the rocks and isotope analysis show that this impact structure dates from the end of the Cretaceous period, roughly 66 million years ago. The impact associated with the crater is implicated in causing the extinction of the dinosaurs.\nA 2007 study suggested that the bolide may have been a piece of a much larger asteroid that broke up in a collision and also produced 298 Baptistina, 160 million years ago. The results of this study were disproven in 2011 using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This data revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago. \nIn March 2010, following analysis of the available evidence covering 20\u00a0years' worth of data in the fields of palaeontology, geochemistry, climate modelling, geophysics and sedimentology, 41\u00a0international experts from 33 institutions reviewed available evidence. They said the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions during the K-T boundary, including that of dinosaurs.\nScientists can now describe in detail how the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs produced its huge crater. The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing its rocks.\nEvidence of impact.\nScientists have found evidence of fallout from the asteroid impact. Excavations in North Dakota reveal fossils of fish and trees that were sprayed with rocky, glassy fragments that fell from the sky. The deposits also show evidence of being swamped with water. This was caused by the colossal sea surge caused by the impact."}

There are three kinds of osteoporosis.\nThere is no cure for osteoporosis. A person can keep it from happening by exercising and taking the right amount of calcium each day. 75 million people in the United States, Japan, and Europe have osteoporosis. 30 million people in the US have poor bone density. Vitamin D, calcium, and exercise are the three main things for healthy bones. Consuming too much alcohol and caffeine can cause an increase in the risk of weak bones. Too much salt increases the amount of calcium lost in urine. This is bad because calcium makes bones strong. People should not take iron and calcium supplements at the same time. This is because calcium competes with the absorption of minerals such as iron."}

The instruments were piano, cornet, flute, and violin. Their first recordings were made in 1888 for Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the phonograph, the first device that could record and play back sound.\nSoon, more instruments were added, including the trombone and clarinet, but the band started losing popularity to larger groups. After a client (Columbia) of the company Issler recorded most for (the United States Phonograph Co. of Newark, NJ) started its own studio orchestra, the band faded away. They made their last recordings in 1900, although they may have continued performing into the early 1900s.\nThe band's four core members were:\nNotable recordings.\nAll of Issler's records were recorded on fragile hollow cylinders made of a waxy blend of materials that usually became brown-colored during the making of the blank cylinders, so they are called \"brown wax cylinders\" because of their shape and usual color. Their actual color can be anywhere from nearly white to a very dark brown. They are about 4\u00bc\u00a0inches long and 2\u00bc\u00a0inches in diameter. Not many cylinder records made in the 1890s have survived and the survivors are almost never in like-new condition, so the sound recorded on them is now less clear than what people heard when they were new and there is much more noise mixed in with it."}

It starts with a lightly toasted English muffin. The muffin is topped with cooked bacon or Canadian bacon, and poached eggs. The dish is completed with a small amount of hollandaise sauce. Many variations on the dish exist. There are several stories about the origin of Eggs Benedict.\nOrigin.\nThere are several stories about how Eggs Benedict started.\nThere have been many \u201cBenedicts\u201d who have tried to claim credit for the invention of the dish, but they are all frauds. A \u201cbenedict\u201d was slang for a newly married gent who had been single for a very long time. Many of these\"benedict\" did not take well to married life and often sought refuge of strange beds and bedfellows. It is for them that the dish was named.\nIn an interview in \"The New Yorker\" magazine in 1942, Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, said that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered \"buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon and a hooker of hollandaise.\" Oscar Tschirky, the \"ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel\", was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham and a toasted English muffin for the bacon and toast.\nCraig Claiborne, in September 1967, wrote a column in \"The New York Times Magazine\" about a letter he had received from Edward P. Montgomery, an American living in France. In it, Montgomery related that the dish was created by Commodore E.C. Benedict, a banker and yachtsman, who died in 1920 at the age of 86. Montgomery also included a recipe for eggs Benedict, stating that the recipe had been given to him by his mother, who had received it from her brother, who was a friend of the Commodore.\nMabel C. Butler of Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts in a November 1967 letter printed in \"The New York Times Magazine\" responded to Montgomery's claim by correcting that the \"true story, well known to the relations of Mrs. Le Grand Benedict\", of whom she was one, was:\nPublished references.\nDates given refer to date of publication.\n1898\u2014In \"Eggs, and how to use them\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as \"split and toast some small muffins; put on each a nice round slice of broiled ham, and on the ham the poached egg; pour over some Hollandaise sauce\"\n1900\u2014In \"The Connecticut Magazine: an Illustrated Monthly, Volume VI\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as \"A third variety is called Eggs Benedict. Broil a thin slice of cold-boiled ham cut the size of a small baker's loaf; toast a slice of bread, butter it and moisten with a little water; lay the ham on it and on that a poached egg. Serve individually.\"\n1907\u2014In \"Many Ways for Cooking Eggs\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given that starts with the muffins. Unlike yeast leavened English muffins, the recipe muffins use baking powder and beaten egg whites for leavening; however, they are still baked on a griddle in muffin rings. The remainder of the recipe reads \"Broil thin slices of ham. Make a sauce Hollandaise. Chop a truffle. Poach the required number of eggs. Dish the muffins, put a square of ham on each, then a poached egg and cover each egg nicely with sauce Hollandaise. Dust with truffle and serve at once.\"\n1914\u2014In the 1914 printing of \"The Neighborhood Cook Book\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as \"Place a slightly fried piece of ham on a piece of toast, place poached egg on ham, and pour over all a Hollandaise sauce.\"\n1918\u2014In the 1918 printing of the \"Boston Cooking-School Cook Book\", a recipe for Eggs \u00e0 la Benedict is given as \"Split and toast English muffins. Saut\u00e9 circular pieces of cold boiled ham, place these over the halves of muffins, arrange on each a dropped egg, and pour around Hollandaise Sauce II, diluted with cream to make of such consistency to pour easily.\"\n1919\u2014In \"The Hotel St. Francis Cook Book\", a recipe for eggs Benedict is given as \"Cut an English muffin in two, toast, and put on platter. Put a slice of broiled ham on top of each half, a poached egg on top of the ham, cover all with Hollandaise, and lay a slice of truffle on top of the sauce.\"\n1938\u2014An advertisement for \"Haill Hayden's Hollandaise\"\u2014a bottled hollandaise sold in a 6-ounce jar for 50\u00a2\u2014runs in \"The New York Times\". \"Here is a sauce such as no man has had before. On tasting it, great chefs have broken their egg-beaters over their knees and wept in jealousy! It is made of butter fragrant from timothy and alfalfa, eggs to which their mothers are still clucking at this hour, lemon and pungent spices! It is not profaned with a drop of oil or any substitutes. Serve it over cauliflower, artichokes, lettuce, eggs Benedict, fish, singing 'Broccoli, Broccoli,' as you eat\".\n1942\u2014In an interview in \"The New Yorker\", Lemuel Benedict claims to have originated the dish with an order at the Waldorf Hotel, hoping for a hangover cure.\n1967\u2014Craig Claiborne writes in \"The New York Times Magazine\" that Edward P. Montgomery wrote him a letter to say that eggs Benedict originated with Commodore E.C. Benedict.\n1967\u2014In a letter printed in \"The New York Times Magazine\", Mabel C. Butler responds to Montgomery's claim by stating that Mrs. Le Grand Benedict originated the dish with an order at Delmonico's.\n1978\u2014In the Neil Simon comedy film California Suite, Maggie Smith, who won best supporting actress award, laments that she cannot get Eggs Benedict late at night, staying in the exclusive 5 star hotel she is in, playing in fact, an academy award losing actress as a part.\nLater editions of Charles Ranhofer\u2019s cookbook \"The Epicurean\" contain a recipe for \u201cEggs \u00e0 la Benedick\u201d; however, the recipe is not present in the original 1894 edition. Save for a hiatus from 1876 to 1879, Charles Ranhofer was the chef at Delmonico's from 1862 till his retirement in 1896."}

It was started in 1948.\nHistory.\nThe encyclopedia was published by Bracha Peli who had already created another encyclopedia. The man in charge was her son who was named Alexander.\nA committee decided the aims of the encyclopedia in 1944. Printing of the first part began in 1948. This was the year that Israel became a country. The president of the encyclopedia project was also the President of Israel, Professor Chaim Weizmann. The first photograph in the encyclopaedia was of Israel's Declaration of Independence.\nThe first volume covered the entries for the letter \"Aleph\" (\u05d0) to Australia.\nThe introduction said:\n... we will finish publishing all 16 volumes within five or six years...\nThe writing took more than thirty years. The encyclopedia had thirty-two volumes when it was finished. An Index (publishing)|index was not printed until 1985. In 1995 there were large updates of entries dealing with the State of Israel.\nThe supervisor was always Alexander Plai. Its editors were Joseph Klausner, Benzion Netanyahu, Yeshayahu Leibowitz, Nathan Rotenstreich, Yehoshua Gutman, and Joshua Prawer. More than 2500 people wrote the encyclopedia.\nSome people felt it was very important to be included in the encyclopedia. They would ask the editors to make sure they had an article about them. Other articles caused arguments e.g. Adolf Hitler.\nThe Schocken Publishing House has been working on a new edition of the encyclopedia.\nContent.\nThe \"Encyclopaedia Hebraica\" said it was about \"General, Jewish, and Israeli\" ideas. The encyclopaedia covers all the general topics, but the articles were larger on Judaism, Jews, and Israel. The encyclopaedia includes the Jewishness of the person, even when it is not important.\nArticles on countries and cities include their history and then a Jewish history. For places which were under Nazi rule an account is given of the Jewish people during the Holocaust.\nWriters of the encyclopaedia did not hide their Jewish views. The Kingdom of Jordan was not in the first edition. Instead Jordan was included in the article \"Land of Israel,\".\nThe letter Aleph contains the largest number of articles. The longest article is \"Land of Israel\" which takes all of volume 6.\nNext in size is \"United States of America\". The large size of the aleph articles reflects the enthusiasm of the early editors. It became clear that the encyclopaedia would never come to an end. The plan was changed. The final size of the encyclopaedia was smaller than planned.\nThe woman who owned it was Bracha Peli. She died in 1986. In 1997 the encyclopedia was sold to another company."}

The weeds are eaten by caterpillars of the monarch butterfly and its relatives, and by other herbivorous insects (such as beetles, and true bugs). These insects are able to feed on the plants despite their chemical defences. Milkweed is named after its milky sap, which contains alkaloids, latex, and several other complex compounds. Some species are toxic.\nPollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner, as the pollen is grouped into pollen sacs. The feet or mouthparts of flower visiting insects such as bees, wasps and butterflies, slip into one of the five slits in each flower formed by adjacent anthers. The bases of the pollinia then mechanically attach to the insect, pulling a pair of pollen sacs free when the pollinator flies off. Pollination is effected by the reverse procedure in which one of the pollinia becomes trapped within the anther slit.\nMilkweeds have three defenses to limit damage by caterpillars and other insects: hairs on the leaves, toxins, and latex fluids. Some more recent milkweed species grow faster than older species. They have the potential to grow faster than caterpillars can eat them. Caterpillars which eat milkweeds, and their adult butterflies, may be protected by the foul taste of the milkweed chemicals. Such butterflies and caterpillars usually show warning colors (see mimicry#warning coloration)."}

Cordite was used to propel (fire) shells and bullets to their targets. Weizmann developed a production of acetone from the anaerobic fermentation of maize and horse chestnuts by bacteria. As a result, the production of shells rose from 500,000 in the first five months of the war to 16.4 million in 1915.\nWeizmann was President of Israel from 1948, and he died in 1952.

The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as \"The Earth Galleries\", with the exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled \"The Life Galleries\". The Natural History Museum's own Mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building.\nThe newly developed \"Darwin Centre\" (named after Charles Darwin) is designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, and new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff. Built in two phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most important new project in the museum's history.\nScientific work.\nThe museum employs 300 scientific staff, and has huge collections of fossils, rocks and minerals, as well as the preserved specimens of present-day plants and animals. There are over 70 million specimens in the collections. Data bases of the collections are being developed."}

They went in decline at the end of the Eocene, and became extinct in the early Oligocene.\nOverview.\nAt the start of the Palaeocene, there were (so far as we know) no large carnivores on land. The surviving mammals and birds evolved into many of the ecological niches previously occupied by dinosaurs and pterosaurs. This process is called adaptive radiation. The mesonychids were the first group to become larger carnivores.\nThey soon had competition. By the later Palaeocene there were several other groups of land carnivores. The giant flightless bird \"Gastornis\" appeared in the Upper Palaeocene, and the Creodonts had also evolved. The Creodonts became an important order, and would certainly have been serious competitors of the mesonychids.\nMost important of all, the modern order Carnivora became significant in the Eocene. They were a sister group to the mesonychids, and started as small forms in the Palaeocene. Once they increased in size they would have been direct competitors of the mesonychids.\nThe broken-up Gondwana gave rise to southern continents which the early placental mammals could not get to. Africa and India eventually bumped into Eurasia, and South America sometimes had land connection to North America. All this lead to 'faunal interchange'. Australasia developed its own carnivores, which became extinct only in modern times.\nSize and habits.\nLarge size was common. The famous \"Andrewsarchus\" had a skull a metre long, which is much larger than that of the modern Kodiak bear.\nMesonychid teeth consisted of molars which were laterally compressed and often blunt and were probably used for shearing meat or crushing bones. Many species are suspected of being fish-eaters, and the largest species may have been scavengers."}

It is calculated by dividing the conductivity (how well the electrolyte conducts electricity) by the molar concentration (how much the electrolyte is diluted: a solution means that it has been dissolved in something else: see solution). In short, Molar conductivity increases with the decrease in concentration. It is measured in siemens metre 2 per molarity (S m2 mol\u22121). The symbol for molar conductivity is \u039b, or \u039bm."}

The city was once a major tourist destination and was described by Queen Elizabeth as the \"Switzerland\" of the former British Empire. \nHowever because of the Taliban, tourism has suffered due to fighting between the Taliban and the government. In March 2009 the city came under Taliban rule due to a peace agreement with the government.

The Intracoastal Waterway separates it from the cities of West Palm Beach and Lake Worth. As of 2004, 9,860 people lived there.\nHistory.\nPalm Beach began as a resort town when Henry Morrison Flagler, a founder of Standard Oil, built the Florida East Coast Railway down the coast of Florida. In the center of the community, Flagler built two luxury resort hotels, the Royal Poinciana Hotel and The Breakers Hotel. West Palm Beach was built across Lake Worth as a service town, and is now a major city.\nFlagler's land for houses was bought by people active in the Gilded Age, and in 1902 Flagler himself built a Beaux-Arts mansion named Whitehall, designed by the New York\u2013based firm Carr\u00e8re and Hastings and helped start the Palm Beach winter \"season\" by entertaining visitors. The town was incorporated on April 17, 1911.\nAn area known as the Styx housed many of the servants, most of whom were black. The workers rented their small houses from the landowners. In the early 1900s the land owners agreed to evict all of the residents of the Styx (who moved to West Palm Beach) and Edward R. Bradley bought up much of this land."}

{"id": "204876", "revid": "664627", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=204876", "title": "Homosociality", "text": "Homosociality is a term used in sociology, which describes a same-sex relationship which is not romantic or sexual in nature. These relationships might be called friendships, mentorships, or other. Heterosociality is the opposite. It means that one prefers socializing with members of the opposite sex without bringing romance or sex into the relationship. Eve Sedgwick made the term popular in her discussion of male homosocial desire, but Jean Lipman-Blumen had defined homosociality in 1976 as a preference for members of one's own sex.\nFor example, a close relationship between two men (such as George and Lennie in \"Of Mice and Men\" (and indeed most of the characters in that book) would be a homosocial relationship. It can apply to single sex schools, prisons, monasteries, but also to simple friendships.\nThe relationship \"can\" be a sexual one, but a homosocial relationship can occur between homosexuals, heterosexuals or both.\nIt is often used to describe the all-male world of medieval knights, or sailors. While it can apply to both men or women, it is most commonly used to refer to men.\nEvidence.\nRose surveyed males and females between the ages of 20 and 28. Rose asked men and women about how they felt about same and cross-sex friendships. Both men and women preferred same sex friendships. Both men and women said that cross-sex relationships were less helpful, and less loyal than same-sex friendships. Friendship formation was found to be different between cross-sex and same-sex relationships as well. \nDepending on the culture, and family and social stuctures, same-sex preferences have been found to develop between 3 and 9 years old. (LaFreniere, Strayer,&amp; Gauthier, 1984; Jacklin&amp; Maccoby, 1978; Harkness &amp; Super, 1985) LaFreniere, Strayer, and Gauthier (1984) conducted a three year long study observing fifteen peer groups between the ages of 1 to 6 years old, with 98 boys and 93 girls. As they looked into sex-segregation in childhood, the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exihibit these preferences around 3\u20134 years old. However, in a study by Harkenss and Super, Kenyan children do not have sex-preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didn\u2019t occur until parental expectations and customary duties increased. \u201cJust when and how such gender segration appears, is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche\u201d (Harkness &amp; Super, 1985).\nThe social bias towards members of one\u2019s own sex can develop early in children. Specifically, studies have found that by the early age of 3 or 4, children prefer members of their own sex to members of the opposite sex (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1992). That is, young girls favor other females (girls and women) over males (boys and men). The findings are identical for young boys. Also, Carol Martin (1989) found that boys 4.5 years of age expressed significantly more dislike for a girl depicted as a \u201ctomboy\u201d than a boy depicted as a \u201csissy\u201d; whereas boys 8.5 years of age express more dislike for a boy depicted as a \u201csissy\u201d. This age difference suggests that children as young as 4 prefer their own sex regardless of gender-incongruent behavior. Around the age of 8 however, boys begin to show males\u2014devaluing feminine behavior. It has also been shown that children ages 10\u201312 prefer same-sex socializing. That is, girls favored girls who socialized with other girls and boys liked boys who socialized with other boys.\nSexual orientation.\nHomosociality, by definition, implies neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality. For example, a heterosexual male who prefers to socialize with men may be considered a homosocial heterosexual. The term is often used by feminists to emphasize aspects of solidarity between males. Feminists also identify a close link between female homosociality, feminism and lesbian desire, with Audre Lorde stating \"the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women.\""}

Richard Owen wanted to rename the creature Zeuglodon (\"yoked tooth\"), but by taxonomic rules the creature's first name remained permanent. Fossils of \"B. isis\" have been found in Egypt and Jordan. \nFar from being a marine reptile, \"Basilosaurus\" is a stage in the evolution of whales.

It had characteristics of the inner ear which are found only in cetaceans: the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only. This suggests that it is a transitional species between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans.\nComplete skeletons were discovered in 2001. \"Pakicetus\" was mainly a land animal, about the size of a wolf, and very similar in form to the related mesonychids."}

In 1957 he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, where he served one term before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1958. He served 12 terms as a Republican representative from the 4th District of Illinois, a suburban region south and west of Chicago, eventually becoming the ranking member of the House Foreign Relations Committee.

O'Brien were placed in the same district, and O'Brien won the 1982 primary on the strength of having more of his previous district included in the new change. After Derwinski's loss, President Ronald Reagan picked him to be Counselor to the State Department. In 1987, Reagan picked him to be Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, where he served until the end of Reagan's term.

They are caused by the effects of heat, deforming pressure, shearing stress, hot/chemically active fluids, or a combination of these. All of these changes occur while the rock remains essentially in the solid state. In theory, rocks are formed when the things surrounding them are in equilibrium with ambient physical conditions. If the conditions are changed by movements in the earth's crust or by igneous activity, metamorphism occurs to reestablish equilibrium and changes the physical character of the rock mass."}

The embassy building is located at Kristianiagade 5 in Indre \u00d8sterbro, Copenhagen. The building is heritage listed.\nHistory of the chancery.\nIn 1897, Otto M\u00f8nsted, a Danish businessman and margarine magnate, purchased three pieces of land in \u00d8sterbro, Copenhagen and hired architect Vilhelm Dahlerup to design a villa. Dahlerup, who specialised in Italian Renaissance style design had previously designed the Hotel D\u2019Angleterre, Jesus Church in Valby, National Gallery, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, amongst others. Completed in 1899, the building of the mansion cost M\u00f8nsted half a million krone.\nThe entrance was decorated with a monogram with the initials AOM (for Anna-Otto-M\u00f8nsted). The M\u00f8nsteds kept a large staff in their mansion. Gardeners creating a large garden. In the garage M\u00f8nsted kept Copenhagen's most expensive car. The M\u00f8nsteds also bred Scottish hunting dogs and kept race horses in the barn.\nIn 1934 Anna M\u00f8nsted sold the mansion for 265,000 krone to Countess Musse Scheel. Scheel was a Danish actress and became the last private owner of the mansion. Scheel was an animal lover and was regarded as being eccentric. Scheel kept a hen house in the yard and sold eggs to her neighbours.\nDuring the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany the mansion was the headquarters of the \"Northern Society\". The Northern Society promoted cultural co-operation between Nazi Germany and the Nordic countries.\nIn 1950, the Soviet Union signed a contract leasing the mansion for 20,000 krone per year. In 1982, the mansion, as well as Kristianiagade 3 (consulate) and Bergensgade 11 (embassy school), were granted to the Soviets, on the basis of reciprocity, free of charge for the purpose of embassy requirements for a period of 70 years, until 31 December 2051.\nThe building and garage are heritage listed buildings.

{"id": "204965", "revid": "470168", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=204965", "title": "Parthenogenesis", "text": "Parthenogenesis is a term in biology. It means \"virgin birth\". It is an asexual form of reproduction. Females lay eggs without fertilization by a male. Growth and development of embryos occurs with all genes inherited from the mother.\nIt occurs in both plants and animals and is much less common than sexual reproduction. It even occurs in vertebrates:there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles, amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process.\nSome plants and animals can reproduce either sexually or asexually. A good example are the aphids, (e.g. greenfly) which multiply parthenogenetically during the height of summer, but turn to sexual reproduction as the weather gets worse. At different times of the year, they can be viviparous (live birth) or oviparous (eggs). During spring and summer, aphids usually produce live young (nymphs) parthenogenetically. These female aphids may or may not have wings. Males only appear in any number at the close of the season. Females then give birth sexually during autumn, laying eggs. Therefore aphids are said to undergo 'cyclical parthenogenesis'.\nAnother interesting fact is that there is a whole order of rotifers (the Bdelloid rotifers) where males have never been found. This is the largest taxonomic category to reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis.\nOther types of asexual reproduction exist. Clones are produced by many Hydrozoa (for example, many corals). Colonies grow, not by laying eggs, but by budding off new individuals. Very similar is reproduction by splitting, common in several phyla such as echinoderms and sponges. These methods are not called parthenogenesis, because they do not work by females laying eggs."}

{"id": "205108", "revid": "551548", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205108", "title": "Santa Monica Mountains", "text": "The Santa Monica Mountains are a group of mountains in southern California in the United States.\nGeography.\nThe range extends about 40 mi (64\u00a0km) east\u2013west from the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles to Point Mugu in Ventura County. The mountains form a line between the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin, separating \"the Valley\" on the north and west-central Los Angeles on the south. The Santa Monica Mountains are parallel to Santa Susana Mountains, on the north side the San Fernando Valley. Beginning at the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley, the mountains are bordered to the north by the Los Angeles River. The river flows south after Elysian Park, defining the easternmost edge of the mountains. Mt. Washington, on the other side of the river, has almost the same native plants and weather.\nGeology.\nScientists who study rocks say that the northern Channel Islands are a westward extension of the Santa Monicas into the Pacific Ocean. The range was created by the Raymond Fault which made the rocks push up and sink down over time. This has made old volcano rock come to the surface. Malibu Creek cuts the mountain range in two.\nWeather.\nThe Santa Monica Mountains have dry, warm to humid summers and wet, mild to cool winters. In the summer, the weather is quite dry, which makes the range prone to wildfires. Snow is unusual in the Santa Monica Mountains, since they are not as high as the nearby San Gabriel Mountains. \nOn January 17, 2007, an unusually cold storm brought snow in the Santa Monica Mountains. Malibu picked up three inches (eight centimeters) of snow \u2013 the first measurable snow in five decades (50 years). Snow was reported on Boney Peak, in the winter of 2005; and in March 2006, snow also fell on the summit of the mountain.\nArcheology.\nThe mountains have more than 1,000 places where people lived a long time ago, including many places where Tongva and Chumash people lived. \nDevelopment and parks.\nCahuenga Pass, present-day site of U.S. Route 101, is the easiest pass through the range connecting the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley. In the 1800s, two battles were fought there, and the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed nearby. In the heyday of Hollywood movie studios clustered on both sides of it. Sepulveda Pass is the main north\u2013south pass to the west, connecting the Westside to Sherman Oaks via the San Diego Freeway (I-405). Farther west are Topanga Canyon Boulevard (SR 27), Malibu Canyon Road, and Kanan Dume Road. Mulholland Drive runs much of the length of the Santa Monica Mountains, from Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills while the Mulholland Highway runs from Woodland Hills to Sequit Point. The eastern end of the range, located in the City of Los Angeles, is more intensively developed than the western end of the range. The city of Malibu runs between the coast and the leading mountain ridge, from Topanga Canyon in the east to Leo Carrillo State Park in the west. The term Malibu Ozarks is sometimes used derogatorily (or ironically) for the unincorporated part of Malibu beyond the leading mountain ridge and lacking an ocean view; the term is often used synonymously with \"818 Malibu\" (referring to the less desirable San Fernando Valley telephone area code prefix).\nMuch of the mountains are located within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Preservation of lands within the region are managed in part by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. Over twenty individual state and municipal parks are in the Santa Monica Mountains, including: Topanga State Park, Leo Carrillo State Park, Malibu Creek State Park, Point Mugu State Park, Will Rogers State Historic Park, Point Dume State Beach, Griffith Park, Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park, Charmlee Wilderness Park, Runyon Canyon Park, and the Paramount Ranch.\nPlaces along the north slope of the mountains include (from east to west):\nPlaces along the south slope of the mountains include (from east to west):\nLos Angeles River.\nThe southwestern headwaters of the Los Angeles River are in the Santa Monica Mountains. The Los Angeles River also forms the northern boundary of the mountains from the easternmost part of the San Fernando Valley to Elysian Park, where the river turns south, thereby defining the easternmost part of the mountain range.\nGriffith Park.\nGriffith Park and finally Elysian Park are the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains. Griffith Park is separated from the rest of the Santa Monica Mountains to the west by the Cahuenga Pass, over which the 101 Freeway passes from the San Fernando Valley into Hollywood. Elysian Park is the easternmost part of the mountains and is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east.\nWildlife.\nThe Santa Monica Mountains are in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion and are covered by hundreds of local plant species, some of which are very rare, and others of which have become popular ornamentals. The range is host to an immense variety of wildlife, from mountain lions to the endangered steelhead. The mountain lion population within the Santa Monica Mountains (which includes the Simi Hills &amp; Santa Susana Pass) is severely depleted with only seven known living adult individuals. The primary cause of the decline is due to a combination of traffic related mortality (three from the area were killed within a matter of months), anti-coagulants ingested from human-poisoned prey (two individuals within the Simi Hills) and attacks by other, more dominant mountain lions (an elder male, known as P1, killed both his son and his mate. This is thought to be due to a lack of space available.) Snakes are common but only occasionally seen \u2013 the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake (the only venomous species), Mountain Kingsnake, California Kingsnake, Gopher snake, and Garter snake."}

It is dance music introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorr\u00edn in 1953. The rhythm was developed from a previous dance, the danz\u00f3n, by a split fourth beat. The name is derived from the shuffling of the dancers' feet.\nMusic.\nMany consider the \"Orquesta Arag\u00f3n\" and the orchestra of Jos\u00e9 Fajardo to have been particularly influential in the development of the cha-cha-cha. Outside Cuba, the big bands of Tito Puente (in New York), and P\u00e9rez Prado (in Mexico City and California) introduced the Cha-cha-cha to a much wider audience.\nDance.\nMusically, the Cha-cha-cha was perhaps not a great innovation. However, it became hugely popular because people found it easy to dance to. Monsieur Pierre and his colleagues went to Cuba in the early 1950s to study it. They came back to London and codified the dance (sorted it out and wrote it down). It became a standard dance in Latin American ballroom dancing. It is one of the five Latin dances in international competitions governed by the World Dance Council. Today it is still popular as a dance, and is still danced in Cuba."}

The parlour is a room in a house where people could meet. In Turkey it is called a kiosk. The Bible (Judges 3:20), talks about the \"summer parlour\", a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze. It has a door to the outside by which visitors can enter.\nIn parts of Great Britain and the United States, parlour is a common name for certain types of restaurants such as \"ice cream parlour\" and \"pizza parlour\". There are also \"Beer parlors\", wine parlors, or, in at least one case, a \"spaghetti parlor.\" The word \"parlour\" has even been used to describe a coffee shop as the \"coffee parlor.\" It can also mean a special service business, such as a tattoo parlour.\nThe \"inner parlours\" in 1 Chronicles 28:11 in the Bible were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the Temple (1 Kings 6:5). Some people think the inner parlours may have been the porch and the holy place.\nIn medieval Christian usage, the parlour was one of two rooms in a monastery. The 'outer parlour' was the room where the monks or nuns could meet a visitor and do business with people from outside the monastery. It was generally in the west range of the buildings of the cloister, close to the main entrance. The 'inner parlour' was found off the cloister, next to the chapter house in the east range of the monastery. Most religious orders wanted silence in the cloister, which was the place where the monks studied. The inner parlour was a place where the monks could talk without disturbing the others in the cloister.\nIn modern use, the parlour is a formal \"sitting room\" in a large house or mansion. In the late 19th century, it was often a formal room used only on Sundays or special occasions, and closed during the week.

{"id": "205203", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205203", "title": "Cuban music", "text": "Cuban music comes from the Caribbean island of Cuba. Cuba has developed a wide range of musical styles, which draw on its cultural origins in Europe and Africa. Cuba's music has been hugely popular and influential throughout the world. It has been perhaps the most popular form of world music since the introduction of recording technology.\nThe music of Cuba, including the instruments and the dances, is mostly of European (Spanish) and African origin. Most forms of the present day are fusions and mixtures of these two great sources. The original inhabitants of Cuba died out, and little remains of their traditions.\nOverview.\nLarge numbers of African slaves and European (mostly Spanish) immigrants came to Cuba and brought their own forms of music to the island. European dances and folk musics included the zapateo, the fandango, the paso doble, the minuet, the gavotte, the contradanza, and the waltz appeared among the urban whites.\nThe African slaves and their descendants made many percussion instruments and preserved rhythms they had known in their homeland. The most important instruments were the drums. Also important are the claves, two short hardwood batons, and the caj\u00f3n, a wooden box, originally made from crates. Claves are still used often, and cajons (\"cajones\") were used widely during periods when the drum was banned.\nThe great instrumental contribution of the Spanish was their guitar, but even more important was the tradition of European musical notation and techniques of musical composition.\nFernando Ort\u00edz described Cuba's musical innovations as arising from the interplay between African slaves settled on large sugar plantations and Spanish or Canary Islanders who grew tobacco on small farms.\nThe African beliefs and practices certainly influenced Cuba's music. Polyrhythmic percussion is an inherent part of African life &amp; music, as melody is part of European music. Also typical is syncopation, which is heard in the \"cinquillo\", a basic rhythm of the habanera, the danz\u00f3n, the Argentine tango and other dances.\nAlso, in African tradition, percussion is joined to song and dance, and to a particular social setting. It is not simply entertainment added to life, it \"is\" life. The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized (fused). This creolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.\nCuban music has been immensely influential in other countries, contributing not only to the development of jazz and salsa, but also to Argentinian tango, Ghanaian highlife, West African afrobeat, and Spanish Nuevo flamenco.\nHistory.\n18th/19th centuries.\nThe Cathedrals of the old capital, Santiago de Cuba, and Havana, both employed fine musicians and choir-masters. They composed, taught and directed. This helped the development of all kinds of music. In the 19th century, Manuel Saumell (1818\u20131870), was the father of Cuban criole musical development. He helped transform the European contradanza by adding African rhythmical elements, and had a hand in the habanera, and the danzon, two typically Cuban dance forms.\nDuring the middle years of the 19th century, a young American musician came to Havana: Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829\u20131869), whose father was a Jewish businessman from London, and his mother a white creole of French Catholic background. Gottschalk was brought up mostly by his black grandmother and nurse Sally, both from Dominique. He was a piano prodigy who had listened to the music and seen the dancing in Congo Square, New Orleans from childhood. His period in Cuba lasted from 1853 to 1862, with visits to Puerto Rico and Martinique squeezed in. He composed many famous pieces which were genuinely Cuban, as they drew on traditions of both whites and blacks.\nIn February 1860 Gottschalk produced a huge work \"La nuit des tropiques\" in Havana. The work used about 250 musicians and a choir of 200 singers plus a drum group from Santiago de Cuba. He produced another huge concert the following year, with new material. These shows probably dwarfed anything seen in the island before or since, and no doubt were unforgettable for those who attended.\nIt was Ignacio Cervantes (1847\u20131905), who was probably most influenced by Gottschalk. Trained in Paris, he did much to assert a sense of Cuban musical nationalism in his compositions. Aaron Copland once referred to him as a \"Cuban Chopin\" because of his Chopinesque piano compositions. Cervantes' reputation today rests almost solely upon his famous forty-one \"Danzas Cubanas\", of which Carpentier said \"occupy the place that the \"Norwegian Dances\" of Grieg or the \"Slavic Dances\" of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k occupy in the musics of their respective countries\".\nPopular music.\nMusical theatre.\nFrom the 18th century to modern times, popular theatrical formats used, and gave rise to, music and dance. In addition to staging some European operas and operettas, Cuban composers gradually developed ideas which better suited their creole audience. Recorded music was the way for Cuban music to reach the world. The most recorded artist in Cuba up to 1925 was a singer at the \"Alhambra\", Adolfo Colombo. Records show he recorded about 350 numbers between 1906 and 1917, of which very few survive today.\nThe first theatre in Havana opened in 1776. The first Cuban-composed opera appeared in 1807. Musical theater was hugely important in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. Radio, which began in Cuba in 1922, helped the growth of popular music because it provided publicity and a new source of income for the artists.\nZarzuela is a small-scale light operetta format. Starting off with imported Spanish content, it developed into a running commentary on Cuba's social and political events and problems. A string of front-rank composers, such as Ernesto Lecuona, produced a series of hits for the theatres in Havana. Great stars like the \"vedette\" Rita Montaner, who could sing, play the piano, dance and act, were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris.\nBufo.\nCuban \"Bufo\" theatre is a form of comedy, ribald and satirical. It uses stock types that might be found anywhere in the country. Bufo had its origin around 1800\u20131815: Francisco Covarrubias 'the caricaturist' (1775\u20131850) was its creator. Gradually, the comic types threw off their European models and became more and more creolized and Cuban. Alongside, the music followed. Slang from slave barracks and poor barrios found its way into lyrics:\nGuaracha.\nThe guaracha is a genre of rapid tempo and with lyrics. It originated in Bufo comic theatre, and during the early 20th century was often played in the brothels of Havana. The lyrics were full of slang, and dwelt on events and people in the news.\nContradanza.\nThe contradanza is an historically important dance. It arrived in Cuba in the late 18th century from Europe. The contradanza is a communal sequence dance, with the dance figures in a set pattern. The tempo and style of the music was bright and fairly fast. The earliest Cuban composition of a contradanza is \"San Pascual bailon\", published in 1803. The Cubans developed a number of creolized version, which is an early example of the influence of African tradition in the Caribbean. Most of the musicians were black or mulatto: even early in the 19th century there were many freed slaves and mixed race persons living in Cuban towns.\nThe contradanza supplanted the minuet as the most popular dance until from 1842 on, it gave way to the habanera, a quite different style.\nDanza.\nThis, the child of the contradanza, was also danced in lines or squares. It was also a brisk form of music and dance which could be in double or triple time. This type of dance was eventually replaced by the danz\u00f3n, which was, like the habanera, much slower and more sedate.\nHabanera.\nThe habanera developed out of the contradanza in the early 19th century. Its great novelty was that it was \"sung\", as well as played and danced. Its development was at least partly due to the influence of French-speaking immigrants. The Haitian revolution of 1791 led to many colonial French and their slaves fleeing to Oriente. The \"cinquillo\" is one important rhythmical pattern which made its first appearance at this time.\nThe dance style of the habanera is slower and more stately than the danza; by the 1840s there were habaneras written, sung and danced in Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Spain. Since about 1900 the habanera has been a relic dance; but the music has a period charm, and there are some famous compositions, such as \"Tu\", versions of which have been recorded many times.\nThe Waltz.\nThe waltz (\"El vals\") arrived in Cuba by 1814. It was the first dance in which couples were not linked by a communal sequence pattern. It was, and still is, danced in 3/4 time with the accent on the first beat. It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other, held each other in the 'closed' hold, and, so to speak, ignored the surrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas. The walz has another characteristic: it is a 'travelling' dance, with couples moving round the arena. In Latin dances, progressive movement of dancers is unusual, but does occur in some.\nZapateo.\nA typical dance of the Cuban \"campesino\" or \"guajiro\". A dance of pairs, involving tapping of the feet, mostly by the man. Illustrations exist from previous centuries, but the dance is now defunct.\nTrova.\nIn the 19th century here grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians, troubadors, who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar. They were of great importance as composers, and their songs have been used in all types of Cuban music\nPepe S\u00e1nchez (1856\u20131918), was the father of the \"trova\" and the creator of the Cuban bolero. He had no formal training in music. With remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them. He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him.\nThe first, and one of the longest-lived, was Sindo Garay (1867\u20131968). He was an outstanding composer of songs, and his best have been sung and recorded many times. Garay was also musically illiterate \u2013 in fact, he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 \u2013 but in his case not only were scores recorded by others, but there are recordings. He broadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. He used to say \"Not many men have shaken hands with both Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and Fidel Castro!\" \nChicho Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez (1875\u20131981) was even longer-lived than Garay. Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez was the first trovador to specialize in the Cuban \"son\"; he also sung guaguancos and pieces from the abaku\u00e1 (a black secret society).\nMany of the early trovadores, such as Manuel Corona (who worked in a brothel area of Havana), composed and sung guarachas as a balance for the slower boleros.\nBolero.\nThis is a song and dance form quite different from its Spanish namesake. It originated in the last quarter of the 19th century with the founder of the traditional trova, Pepe S\u00e1nchez. He wrote the first bolero, \"Tristezas\", which is still sung today. The bolero has always been a staple part of the trova muusician's repertoire. The bolero proved to be exceptionally adaptable, and led to many variants. Typical was the introduction of syncopation, leading to the bolero-son, bolero-mambo and bolero-cha. The bolero-son became for several decades the most popular rhythm for dancing in Cuba, and it was this rhythm that the international dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly-named 'rumba'.\nDanz\u00f3n.\nThe European influence on Cuba's later musical development is represented by danz\u00f3n, an elegant musical form that was once the most popular music in Cuba. It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban contradanza. The danz\u00f3n marks the change which took place from the communal sequence dance style of the late eighteenth century to the couple dances of later times. The stimulus for this was the success of the once-scandalous walz, where couples danced facing each other and independently from other couples, not as part of a pre-set structure. The danz\u00f3n was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though there is a difference between the two dances. The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti-clockwise direction; the danz\u00f3n is a 'pocket-handkerchief' dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor.\nThe danz\u00f3n was exported to popular acclaim throughout Latin America, especially Mexico. It is now a relic, both in music and in dance, but its highly orchestrated descendents live on.\nSon.\nThe \"son\", said Crist\u00f3bal D\u00edaz, is the most important genre of Cuban music, and the least studied. It can fairly be said that \"son\" is to Cuba what the tango is to Argentina, or the samba to Brazil. In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-American music. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions. Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban guitar known as the \"tres\", and the well-known double-headed \"bong\u00f3\"; these are present from the start to the present day. Also typical are the claves, the Spanish guitar, the double bass, and early on, the cornet or trumpet and finally the piano.\nThe \"son\" arose in Oriente, the eastern part of the island, merging the Spanish guitar and lyrical traditions with African percussion and rhythms. We now know that its history as a distinct form is relatively recent. There is no evidence that it goes back further than the end of the nineteenth century. It moved from Oriente to Havana in about 1909, carried by members of the \"Permanente\" (the Army), who were sent out of their areas of origin as a matter of policy. The first recordings were in 1918.\nThere are many types of \"son\". Odilio Urf\u00e9 recognised these variants:\nand one can certainly add\nIn addition, the son has again and again changed the older danz\u00f3n to make it more syncopated and creole in style, starting in 1910 through the danz\u00f3n-mambo and the cha-cha-cha to complex modern arrangements which are almost impossible to categorize.\nThe son varies widely today, with the defining characteristic a syncopated bass pulse that comes before the downbeat, giving son its distinctive rhythm; this is known as the \"anticipated bass\".\nCuban jazz.\nThe history of jazz in Cuba was obscured for many years; however it has become clear that its history in Cuba is virtually as long as its history in the USA.\nMuch more is now known about early Cuban jazz bands, though a full assessment is plagued by the lack of recordings. Migrations and visits to and from the USA and the mutual exchange of recordings and sheet music kept musicians in the two countries in touch. In the first part of the 20th century there were close relations between musicians in Cuba and those in New Orleans. The orchestra leader in the famous Tropicana Club, Armando Romeu Jr, was a leading figure in the post-WWII development of Cuban jazz. The phenomenon of cubop, and jam sessions in Havana and New York, created genuine fusions which still influence musicians today.\nThe Buena Vista experience.\nWorld-wide interest in Cuban music was rekindled by a remarkable CD album entitled the \"Buena Vista Social Club\". An American guitarist, Ry Cooder, a British music producer, Nick Gold, and a Cuban musician, Juan Marcos Gonz\u00e1les, worked together on a new venture. They put together a group, mostly of older Cuban musicians, with the idea of recreating the Cuban music of the golden era of the 1950s. The first album, released in 1997, became a huge hit, selling over five million copies, and winning a Grammy in 1998. In 2003 it was listed by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine as #260 in their list of \"The 500 Greatest Hits of All Time\". A dozen more CDs have followed the first one, mostly issued by \"Nonesuch Records\" or \"World Circuit\".\nA documentary movie, \"Buena Vista Social Club\", directed by Wim Wenders, was released in 1999. It grossed $23 million worldwide by 2007. A younger generation had discovered why Cuban music was so popular."}

These laws were enforced in different states between 1876 and 1965. \"Jim Crow\" laws provided a systematic legal basis for segregating and discriminating against African Americans. The laws first appeared after the Civil War and the Reconstruction Era and were enforced through the mid-twentieth century. They were about segregating black and white people in all public buildings. \"Jim Crow\" was a racist term for a black person. Black people were usually treated worse than white people. This segregation was also done in the armed forces, schools, restaurants, on buses and in what jobs blacks got. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled that such segregation in state-run schools was against the US Constitution. The decision is known as \"Brown v. Board of Education\". The other Jim Crow laws were abolished by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) fought against the Jim Crow laws.\nBackground.\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. government tried to enforce the rights of ex-slaves in the South through a process called Reconstruction. However, in 1876, Reconstruction ended. By the 1890s, the Southern states' legislatures were all-white again. Southern Democrats, who did not support civil rights for blacks, completely ruled the South. This gave them a lot of power in the United States Congress. For example, Southern Democrats were able to make sure that laws against lynching did not pass.\nStarting in 1890, Southern Democrats began to pass state laws that took away the rights African Americans had gained. These racist laws became known as Jim Crow laws. For example, they included:\nIn 1896, the United States Supreme Court ruled in a case called \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" that these laws were legal. They said that having things be \"separate but equal\" was fine. In the South, everything was separate. However, places like black schools and libraries got much less money and were not as good as places for whites. Things were separate, but not equal."}

Which of these basic quantities to choose can depend on the physics problems being investigated, and sometimes choosing one thing as a natural unit means that the size of something else does not become used as a natural unit in that system.\nThe old system of English measurements such as the pound are based on convenient objects in the natural world. The \"grain\" is the smallest of these objects, and originally it meant the weight of a grain of wheat or barley. Each individual grain might be slightly larger or smaller than the next, but the more grains were added together to make a larger measure, the more these little differences would even out. Even so, these measures were not entirely precise and did not relate to other measures such as the inch or the foot.\nIn order to make calculations simpler and units more precise, the Metric system was based on facts of nature such as the size of the Earth, the length of a day, and the density of water. Difficulties later developed and other standards are used now for the old measures.\nEventually it turned out that the mass of an electron or the mass of a proton were more useful standards to use for mass. All electrons are believed to have the same mass, and all protons are believed to have their own standard mass. But there is no simple mathematical relationship between the two masses.\nThe speed of light, c, is a constant. So c is a very natural choice to use as a standard for measuring velocity.\nOne choice for a standard of length is the Bohr radius. The simplest atom, hydrogen, only has one electron, and its smallest possible orbit, that with the lowest energy, is at a distance from the nucleus called the Bohr radius.\nWith a standard for measuring distances and a standard for velocity, it would be possible to derive one standard unit of time. In practice, there are several ways of defining units of time. One of the most widely known ways to measure time by natural cycles is by using atomic clocks."}

Before that, she was Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison.\nThe daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis, Alexis grew up a Catholic home in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School. For a short time, she went to Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile, but then switched to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.\nAfter college, Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies advocating minority women employment. Jimmy Carter met Herman while campaigning in Atlanta, Georgia, and after becoming President in 1977, picked her to be Director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position.\nIn 1981, Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman &amp; Associates. She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics. During her time as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, she was in charge of organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.\nAfter Bill Clinton's win in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later picked to head the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration's relations with interest groups.\nDuring Clinton's second term, Herman was named Secretary of Labor, the first African American to be picked for that position and the fifth woman to be picked. Congressional Republicans and labor unions initially opposed giving her the job. But she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike. An independent counsel investigated her for taking cash bribes and/or illegal campaign donations as an assistant to Clinton from 1994 to 1996. She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel. Bill Clinton testified on her side. In 2000 the investigation ended with no indictment.\nDuring the 2000 Florida election recount, Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration, and she was mentioned as a likely pick for White House Chief of Staff. She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao.\nHerman now serves as the co-chairperson (with James Roosevelt, Jr.) of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee.\nHerman also serves on the boards of several big companies, including Coca Cola Corporation's Human Resources Task Force, Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, Cummins, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc."}

He discovered that the momentum (mass times velocity, represented by P) and position (represented by Q) are conjugate variables. This means that P*Q is not equal to Q*P, in quantum physics. \nHere are two special equations to calculate the energy of an electron (small green thing) in a hydrogen atom. \nThe first equation could be used to find out the product of momentum and position:\nThe second equation could be used to calculate the product of position and momentum:\nSome time later, another physicist, Max Born found out that, because P*Q is not equal to Q*P, the result of Q*P minus P*Q is not zero.

{"id": "205557", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205557", "title": "Theory", "text": "A theory is a group of linked ideas intended to explain something. A theory provides a framework for explaining observations. The explanations are based on assumptions. From the assumptions follows a number of possible hypotheses. They can be tested to provide support for, or challenge, the theory.\nThe word 'theory' has several meanings:\nThese meanings can \"shade into each other\". Another source offers: \nA theory in science (in contrast to a theory in layman's terms) is \"a logical, systematic set of principles or explanation that has been verified\u2014has stood up against attempts to prove it false\". For example, Darwin's theory of Evolution is a system of ideas that points to humans and apes having evolved from a common ancestor. This conclusion is based on evidence that supports it.\nLogical consistency.\nOne basic thing needed by a theory is not to defeat itself. If someone argued that every action a human being takes in life is predetermined before that person is even born, and also argued that a human being will determine his or her future according to the acts that he or she freely wills, there is a contradiction. \nThis idea is called \"the principle of non-contradiction\", not saying the opposite of what you just said. If we consider any statement, A (perhaps A stands for \"The Apple has a worm in it.\"), then A and the contradiction of A is always false. (In logical symbolism, the single statement \"A \u2227 \u00acA\" has a truth value of 0 or false.)\nPractical consistency.\nA theory that can produce a statement that is not true, a theory that can predict something that does not in fact happen, or that predicts that something will happen but it does not happen, is not a correct theory. This idea has a big hole to fall into. Scientists can look at experiment after experiment, and they may always find that what theory says is true. Years may pass, and then somebody looks at one more experiment. That experiment shows that the theory is false, and every time they do that experiment it shows that the first time was not some kind of accident. The philosopher Karl Popper gave the example of people in Europe before 1492 who wanted to give scientific descriptions of birds. One bird they worked on was the swan. Somebody proposed the idea, \"All swans are white.\" All of the swans that were checked in their century were white. When Europeans first sailed to Australia, the first swan that they saw was black. Suddenly the old scientific description of swans had to be changed.\nSo it is never possible to prove conclusively that some theory is correct. A \"black swan\" may come with the next experiment. It is possible to prove some theories are incorrect. Science makes progress by using one theory until it fails, trying to understand why that theory failed, and then making a better theory. Some theories are very well confirmed, that means that they have been tried over and over again and have never yet failed. When a theory is well confirmed people trust its predictions.\nIt is possible to prove conclusively that some theory is incorrect. Proving a theory is incorrect makes it possible to find a better theory and thus to make progress."}

It is like the handjob (manual stimulation of the penis). It is a common form of foreplay or mutual masturbation. To \"finger oneself\" is to masturbate in this way.\nDigital penetration is penetration (for example sexual penetration) with one or more fingers.\nVaginal fingering.\nVaginal fingering can end in orgasm. It also may or may not include the entire sexual encounter. It may be part of foreplay or part of a start to other sexual activities. These activities can provide sexual pleasure to a partner when penetrative intercourse is not possible or desirable for whatever reason.\nAnal fingering.\nFingering of the butt and rectum is commonly enjoyed in preparation for further anal sex. Anal fingering can arouse a person, allowing them to relax their anus and prepare them for the insertion of a penis or a dildo.\nSafety.\nThe practice is generally considered safe sex as long as the hands are protected with latex gloves."}

Stark in the 1980s. It was first published on the internet in 1996. The language is a revision of the grammar of the IALA's constructed (made-up) language Interlingua, using the first creator's words with little change. Applying the same principles that were used in developing the international vocabulary for Interlingua to developing a grammar, L.M. restores personal endings on its verbs and has gender and number agreement between its nouns and their adjectives and articles. The language also has a more clear system for showing case differences with its pronouns. This lets L.M. have a more free word order than Interlingua. Most of the changes that L.M. makes to Interlingua are suggestions were really offered first by the creators of Interlingua -- for this reason, L.M. should be viewed as the next step for the IALA project, not as something in competition with it. \nIt is hoped that the spread and use of Latino Moderne may assist in solving some of the communication problems that exist in the European Union and throughout the modern world. In this respect it shares the same goals as Interlingua, Esperanto, etc.. The developer of the language hopes that L.M. will be received and used as a suggested model language to help promote better international communication and friendship among nations.\nCommunity.\nNo community is presently established for the Latino Moderne (L.M.) project. Its developer, David Th. Stark, welcomes any activity in this area by other interested parties. \"The language, Latino Moderne, belongs to all those who desire to use it.\" "}

The community aspect of BookCrossing.com has grown in ways that were not expected at the start, in the form of blog or forum discussions, mailing lists and yearly conventions all over the world.\nHistory.\nRon Hornbaker came up the idea for what is now known as BookCrossing in March 2001. About four weeks later, on April 17, he started the website, which has grown all over the world. By April 2003 the website had over 113,000 members, and in 2004 the \"Concise Oxford Dictionary\" included the word \"bookcrossing\". In the same year, BookCrossing was featured as a part of a storyline in the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\". As of 30 September 2009, Bookcrossing.com had over 814,000 members, with over 5,800,000 registered books.\nIn July 2007 Singapore became the first official BookCrossing country in the world. 2,000 locations within the country were designated as 'hotspots', similar to Official BookCrossing Zones. In 2008, BookCrossing was introduced to Abu Dhabi as part of a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage.\nAwards.\nIn May 2005 BookCrossing.com won two People's Voice awards in the Webby Awards for best community website and best social/networking website. BookCrossing was also featured in a BBC Radio project broadcast as 84 Book Crossing Road , which involved releasing 84 copies of Helene Hanff's book \"84 Charing Cross Road\" around the world. The show was produced by Tim Heffer and Alan Hall of Falling Tree Productions, and was nominated for a Sony Radio Academy Award in 2006.\nAbout.\nAnyone who wishes to \"release\" books, whether leaving it in a public place or passing it on to a friend, must register on the BookCrossing.com website, although there is the option to remain hidden when \"catching\" the find of a book. BookCrossing.com users can 'go hunting', where a member will go to the website to view a list of books that have just been \"released\", then go to the place it was left to \"catch\" it. Books may also be left at Official BookCrossing Zones\" (OBCZs), which are located in certain coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and other public places. The purpose of these places is to get members in the area to leave books to share with the public. This also promotes BookCrossing and creates more members."}
{"id": "205786", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205786", "title": "Bukit Timah", "text": "Bukit Timah is an area in Singapore and a hill in that area. Bukit Timah Hill stands at an altitude of and is the highest point in the city-state of Singapore. Bukit Timah is near the centre of Singapore island. Bukit Timah is 10 kilometres (6 miles) from Singapore's business district.\nEtymology and history of Bukit Timah Hill.\nBukit Timah, which means \"tin-bearing hill\" in Malay, was on the 1828 map by Frankin and Philip Jackson as \"Bukit Timah\". The hill was on the map as the eastern source of the Kranji River.\nIn December 1843, a road was built up to the hill. The hill was an \"excellent sanatorium\", as the air was \"cooler and fresher than the plain, producing an agreeable exhilaration of spirits\".\nFor some, it is synonymous with the Singapore Turf Club, where members and paying visitors flock on race days. This course is closed to the public, unlike the former course (now Farrer Park) where the general public enjoyed watching the king's sport for free.\nThe 25-km long Bukit Timah Road, the longest road in Singapore, running north and south of the island, takes its name from this hill. The road to Kranji was completed in 1845. Apparently, the area was so infested with tigers that it constituted a serious threat to human life. In 1860, nearly 200 people were reported to have been killed by tigers in and about the gambier and pepper plantations. The first ride on horseback across the island was along Bukit Timah Road in 1840; it took four days and was made by Mr Thomson and Dr Little.\nBukit Timah Road is known as \"tek kha kang a kinn\" in Hokkien, which means \"the side of the stream in the \"tek kha\" (or Selegie Road) district\". This only refers to the lower end of the Bukit Timah Road. The Wayang Satu and Bukit Timah village parts are differently called. The Hokkiens also refer to Bukit Timah as \"be chia lo bue\", meaning \"end of the horse carriage road\".\nDuring World War II, the British Army lost Bukit Timah to the Japanese on February 11th, they knew they had little chance of winning the war as most of their food and supplies were stored there. On 15 February 1942, the head of the Allied forces, Lieutenant General A.E. Percival surrendered to Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah.\nDuring the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese troops built a Syonan-to Shinto shrine (Syonan-to was the Occupation name for Singapore), similar to the National Shinto in Japan but of a smaller size, at Bukit Timah Hill. Two war memorials dedicated to the Japanese war dead and surprisingly, to the deceased British troops who died defending Singapore, were built at the site. Students, Japanese commanders, British POWs' representatives would gather there regularly to commemorate the dead during the Occupation.\nIt was only shortly before the Japanese surrender, the Japanese forces hastily destroyed the Shinto Shrine, on fears that returning British forces will demolish it in an bad manner. The present site where the Shinto Shrine existed, lied at a grey area between the Nature Reserve and Singapore Armed Forces restricted area. Several historians have been down at the site, and an episode from then Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) history documentary show, \"Hey Singapore\", was on the mysterious Shinto Shrine. Since then, the Singapore Government has erected the place as \"Historical Site\". No plans have been indicated to restore the site, on speculations of angry responses from the People Republic of China (PRC) and abroad.\nThe Japanese war dead were brought back to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, while the remains of the British troops were instituted at the British Commonwealth's Kranji War Memorial in Singapore. Nothing of the Syonan-to Shinto shrine remains, except for the Holy Cleansing Pond and several Japanese stone pavements left at the site.\nAfter the Japanese Occupation, the farms and plantations in Bukit Timah gave way to industrial buildings and high-rise flats. In the 1960s and 1970s, Bukit Timah was a major industrial center. Today, these have been replaced with luxury bungalows, terraces and condominiums, making Bukit Timah Singapore's premier residential district.\nHighlights.\nThe Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with a high land value. The area of Bukit Timah has an extensive flora and forest compared to the parts of Singapore, and contains Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, which is partially responsible for its high land value. The nature reserve was established in 1883.\nThe Bukit Timah Race Course, a Thoroughbred horse racing facility, was opened in 1933 and operated until 1999.\nThe nearby area houses many bungalows, traditionally expensive in land-scarce Singapore, as well as high rise condominiums. Many expatriates and well heeled Singaporeans tend to stay in this region. The rise in land prices has led to development of new condominiums. For example, the Copthorne Orchid Hotel in Dunearn Road is being redeveloped into condominiums for sale.\nThis region was later extended and Upper Bukit Timah (District 21) was formed. The Keretapi Tanah Melayu from Malaysia has a passing loop station here along its rail network from Johor Bahru to Tanjong Pagar."}

{"id": "205979", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205979", "title": "Vikings", "text": "The Vikings were a Scandinavian people from Northern Europe who were known as great seamen and warriors. From the 8th to the 11th centuries they traveled to Europe in their long ships, attacking and then settling in areas that are now modern Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. \nBackground.\nThe people of the far north, later called Vikings, were first noticed by the Romans around the year 100 BC. This is when the Cimbri and the Teutons moved into southern Gaul. The Romans believed these war-like tribes came from Jutland. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater threat located further north. The Roman historians Jordanes described the destructive Ostrogoths and Visigoths as having come from Gotland. The northern menace survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire. \nThe Frankish Empire that succeeded them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat. As the later Carolingian Empire expanded into northern Germany they came into contact with the Danish people. This is when the Vikings first entered into written history. The first recorded raid in the west was at Lindisfarne in 793. Why the Vikings suddenly began raiding is not completely clear. But a popular theory is the populations had grown to the point there was not enough food to feed everyone. The earliest raiders did not seem to want to move out of Scandinavia. They turned to looting, then returning home. These hit and run raids were made possible because the Vikings were master boat builders and they created flat bottomed boats ideal for journeys up rivers, where many monastic sites lay, ready for plundering. This seems to indicate there was space enough for everyone. Because they found raiding so easy, it became more and more popular among the Vikings.\nThree different groups of Vikings can be identified. They took three different, sometimes overlapping, routes.\nVikings in Europe.\nEuropeans were scared of the Vikings because of their strong weapons, swift attacks, and cruel fighting tactics. They were known for their bad treatment of women, children and monks in the places where they fought. When the Vikings came to England, the English kings paid them to leave the country, but the Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway. These payments were called Danegeld. From the 9th century to 1066, when the French Duke of Normandy, who became King William I of England, conquered it, Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England.\nBecause of their longships, which could float in 4 feet (1.3m) of water, the Vikings were able to make their way up rivers and land deep inside a country. For example they sailed up the River Shannon in Ireland and built a harbour 60 miles (100\u00a0km) from the coast.\nThere was a difference in who led Viking raids. In the 9th century Viking Age raids were led by men who may have been exiles in their own countries. The later Viking raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century and were led by Kings. Some of the early leaders tried to become kings with the riches they plundered from Europe and Russia. Some were successful but most were not.\nIn Russia and the Mediterranean.\nThe Vikings were called Rus' by the peoples east of the Baltic Sea. The Vikings who settled in Kiev formed the first Russian state. The Vikings (Rus') who served the Byzantine Emperors were called Varangians. They became the personal bodyguards to the Emperor and were called the Varangian Guard.\nExploration.\nThe Vikings traveled through Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, southern Europe, northern Africa and south-western Asia. Some Vikings sailed across the Atlantic Ocean via Iceland and Greenland and may have explored places in North America. The ruins of a Viking settlement have been found at L'Anse-aux-Meadows, Newfoundland.\nArchaeologists used radiocarbon dating to find out how old the settlement was. Their tests gave them a range of dates from about AD 700 to about AD 1000.\nLanguage.\nSome English words, and many place names, came from the Scandinavian and Viking language (Norse). For example, the words \"skirt\" and \"shirt\" came from the word \"skyrta\", meaning a tunic. As English changed, the semantics altered to give us the separate words 'skirt' and 'shirt' we know today. \"Skin\" came from the Norse word \"skinn\" (which meant to strip the meat off something). Some place-names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use. For example, in Yorkshire places ending with \"thwaite\" meant a \"clearing\" and \"dale\" meant a \"valley\". The word \"thorpe\" meant \"new village\", such as Scunthorpe.\nReligion.\nThe Anglo-Saxons called the Vikings pagans. They worshiped a great many gods. Viking gods belonged to two groups of gods in Norse mythology. They either belonged to the Aesir or the Vanir. The Aesir were gods of war. Aesir means \"gods\". They were the rulers of Asgard. Odin was the leader of the Aesir. He and the gods under him ruled mortal men. The vanir were wise gods skilled in magical arts. they live in Vanaheim, although nobody knows where it is. The Vanir can also predict the future. There was a war between the Aesir and the Vanir. When it ended the god Njord and his children Freya and Freyr came to live in Asgard.\nThe pagan Vikings were exposed to Christianity from the beginning of the Viking Age. They were surrounded by Christian countries. Early Christian missionaries were either enslaved or put to death. The Vikings came into contact with Christianity when they raided other areas around them. Viking raids produced many Christian slaves who were brought back to Scandinavia. They called Christians \"Cross-men\" because of the cross in their worship. In response many Vikings adopted Thors hammer as their religious symbol. When Vikings settled in Christian areas they converted to Christianity. There are still Headstones in England with both a cross and a hammer. Perhaps they thought it was better to be safe than sorry. That, or the more gods the better. As some Vikings turned from raiding to trading they found a nominal (in name only) profession of Christianity to be helpful. Scandinavia, their homeland, was slower to change to the Christian religion. But by the mid-11th century most of Norway and Denmark had converted. Sweden was converted by the mid-12th century. Overall Scandinavia and the peoples of the Baltic Sea were the last to accept Christianity. \nThe Viking's religion affected Christianity as well. The pagan celebration of Yuletide became Christmas along with the custom of the Christmas tree. Priests blessing the fields took the place of pagan fertility rites of spring held to make sure there was a good harvest. Norse kept their \"farm gods\" well after Christianity just to make sure they were protected. Santa Claus owes much of his legend to the Norse god Odin. With his snow-white beard he traveled the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir visiting his people with gifts. He became Father Christmas. Blended with the Christian Saint Nicholas he (they) became Santa Claus. \nIn fiction and theater.\nIn the late 19th century (1800s), Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They came up with the idea of Vikings wearing fur clothes and helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera \"Ring des Nibelungen\" so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings."}

As Christmas nears, Cliff's grandmother arrives for a visit. Cliff's baby brother is rushed to the hospital with a severe illness. While he is getting better in the hospital on Christmas Eve his family finally figure out that he has been asking Santa Claus for a little ladder like the one used to climb up to the top of a bunk bed.

There are two types of solar panels, those that collect heat (thermal), and those that produce electricity (photovoltaic). Heat from solar panels is often used for space heating and for hot water. \nSolar panels collect renewable energy. In the 20th century some used the heat of the sun to make steam for a steam engine to turn a generator. Nowadays producing electricity from the sun's light is cheaper. This is a solid state way of producing electricity, meaning that it has no moving parts. \nHome solar panels are often mounted on rooftops. Commercial or industrial installations are often on trackers mounted on the ground. The trackers point the panel towards the sun as the sun moves across the sky. Photovoltaic panels are also commonly used in outer space, where they are one of the few power sources available.\nHeat.\nSolar panels for heat are usually made from a box with a clear window on top. Pipes run through the box. The pipes and the box are usually painted black because black absorbs more heat than other colors. The pipes are filled with a heat transfer fluid such as water or oil. A pump circulates the fluid, which heats up as it is exposed to the sun. When the hot fluid leaves the panel, it goes into a heat exchanger, which transfers the heat into water or air. After the now cool fluid leaves the heat exchanger, it is pumped back up into the panel to collect heat again.\nRecycling.\nPhotovoltaic solar panels are built to last about thirty years. So far, most of the solar panels, originally created in the 1980's have not yet reached the end of their estimated lifespans. Many of the solar panels which have expired, however, have been classified as hazardous waste. The used solar panels that have not been considered dangerous can be recycled to create new solar panels. Over 90% of the solar panel is recyclable to create either new solar panels or scrap material. First, the panels are broken down by removing the metal frames and glass plate, leaving the group of solar cell sandwiched between an resin and back film. To actually get to the solar cells themselves, the resin and backing must be removed. \nUsage.\nThe top ten uses for solar panels include,\nInnovations.\nSolar panels have become much cheaper to use, compared to oil, diesel and liquified natural gas in parts of Asia. Solar energy will soon become the main source of energy. Over the years many innovations have been made to improve solar panels. Solar panels have been used for space exploration and are being developed to be able to power cars. Along with this, scientists are developing solar cells in silicone to increase its convenience.\nSolar shingles.\nSolar shingles are a new type of solar panel that look like ordinary asphalt roof shingles. They are used where the appearance of traditional solar panels might be undesirable, such as on residential rooftops. Solar shingles are more expensive and less durable than normal solar panels."}

Commonly \u00a0the meat is already cut into small pieces before grilling, and are then wrapped into bite-sized lettuce leaf packages ssam with garlic, vegetables, seasoning sauce, salt, and/or sesame oil\nRecipe.\nBulgogi Recipe\nIngredients: 1/2 pounds rib eye beef (thinly sliced),2 tablespoons soy sauce,2 teaspoons sesame oil,2 teaspoons crushed garlic,2 tablespoons brown sugar,1 tablespoon rice wine (sake), Pinch of black pepper and 1/2 piece of fresh kiwi, juice in a blender.\nStep 1- Add all the ingredients into a bowl or container one by one\nStep 2- Let the marinade sit overnight or an hour\nStep 3- Get the meat and massage the meat in the marinade to make it tender\nStep 4- Put the meat on the grill\nStep 5- Enjoy!\nSide Dishes.\nThe side dishes are the other fun part. The raw, sliced meats come to the table pre-marinated (usually in soy sauce, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, and sugar) and share the spotlight with a slew of high-flavor accompaniments. Known as banchan, these allow customizing your Korean BBQ to your taste preferences. On the table, there is a bowl of funky kimchi made with cabbage or radishes, some spicy gochujang (fermented chile pepper paste), a dish of sweet-and-sour cucumbers, a fresh watercress or mung bean salad, a bowl of steamed rice, a dish of sesame salt, a savory dipping sauce dotted with chopped Asian pears, and some crisp lettuce leaves for wrapping it all up. It\u2019s like a taco bar with lettuce as the wraps. The many, varied garnishes bring the grilled meat alive. Grill the strips of meat over the charcoal embers just until they are charred by fire and kissed with smoke, then wrap them up with a bit of sweet, a shot of salty, a spark of spice, a lick of acidity, some crunch, and a boatload of savory for what eventually becomes a minor feast of culinary fireworks. There are many other side dishes, some are kongnamul muchim (seasoned bean sprouts), Oi muchim (spicy cucumber salad), Musaengchae (Spicy Radish Salad), Sukju Namul (Seasoned Bean Sprouts), Gamja-salad (potato salad) and so much more side dishes."}

It is one of the most common parasites of fish. It often affects pet fish in tanks and ponds, as well as farm-raised food fish species. Wild fish populations can also get the parasite.\nLife cycle.\nIch is a parasite, it can only survive by living on the skin of the fish, this is called being \"obligate\". The parasite moves by a fish carrying it, other animals, or even humans. The life cycle has three stages: tomont, theront, and trophont. The tomont stage is the adult stage of the parasite. When this adult tomont leaves the fish, it falls to the bottom of the pond. Once the tomont falls to the bottom, it forms a thin cyst wall. Within that cyst wall the tomont begins to divide, creating thousands of tomites. Once all the tomites are made, they are released into the water. Once this occurs, the tomites then develop into an elongated form and are then known as a theront. Theronts are the developmental stage that then can swim to the fish and burrow itself into the epithelial skin. They do this by using a penetrating gland. What makes them an obligate parasite is that if they are not able to penetrate the fish\u2019s skin they will die, so to survive, they need to get into the fish. Once they are in the fish\u2019s skin they are then known as trophonts. The trophonts are protected from the chemical treatment in aquariums or ponds by the fish\u2019s skin, and therefore it is difficult to get rid of them once the fish is infected. The trophonts then mature by feeding on the fish and become adults. The life cycle continues when the adults fall off again. The only stage that can be killed in the water is the tomonts and the theronts. \nAlso interestingly, the \"I. multifiliis\" life cycle from birth to death depends on the temperature of the water. In warm water, 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), the parasite's whole life cycle can take place in seven days. In cold water, 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F), it can take up to eight weeks. \nDisease.\nThe disease starts when the parasite digs into the skin of the fish. This causes swelling and white spots to form. After a few days, the parasite turns into a trophozoite, a jelly-like substance. This falls off the fish and lives on the bottom of the tank. Inside the jelly are hundreds of baby parasites called tomites. These eventually can swim by themselves and go looking for another fish to live in.\nFish may have Ichthyophthirius multifiliis without there being anything to see. Fish owners need to be careful about where they get their fish from, as the disease can spread very easily. There are a number of different ways to try to get rid of the parasite. One method is to heat the water to kill the parasites in the water before they can infect the fish. Another method is to add salt to the water, or put the fish into a salt water bath. The water should be changed frequently to remove the parasites. Chemicals are also available which will kill \"Ichthyophthirius multifiliis\". All these treatments need to be carefully planned for the type of fish species.\nFish with the disease will:\nTreatment.\nIf you find that your fish is infected, here are some simple procedures to follow to help your fish.

The pleura is a slim membrane that covers the lungs. The two parts of the pleura usually touch. A hole might grow in the surface of the lung. Air then enters between the pleura and the lung. The lung will collapse. If enough air gets into the pleural space, it can also push against other organs or parts in the chest, like the heart or the aorta. Pneumothorax is a medical emergency.\nThere are two main types of pneumothorax. These are a Closed Pneumothorax, and an Open Pneumothorax. These are also known as Simple Pneumothorax and Complex Pneumothorax.\nSymptoms.\nThe most common symptoms of Pneumothorax are chest pains. The chest pains can be sharp, dull, or stabbing. Some other symptoms of Pneumothorax are shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and coughing.\nCauses.\nA Pneumothorax can occur for no obvious reason (spontaneous). It is typically men who are tall (or perhaps have long torsos), between the ages of 20 and 40 who present a spontaneous pneumothorax.\nSmall air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the surface of the lungs. These blebs sometimes burst \u2014 allowing air to leak into the pleural space that surrounds the lungs, causing the lung to collapse.\nOtherwise, it can be caused by blunt or penetrating injuries or lung diseases that result in the lung leaking air into the pleural cavity.\nConsuming cannabis via smoking is also related to victims of a pneumothorax.\nTreatment.\nSimple Pneumothorax will heal by itself. Complex pneumothorax will need medical attention. One should treat respiratory problems as soon as they occur.\nClosed pneumothorax.\nClosed pneumothorax is when air or gas gets in the pleural space without any outside wound. This sometimes happens when the lung is already injured somehow, like from diseases such as cancer or cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a disease in the lungs. Glands in the body make large amounts of thick mucus. The mucus blocks ducts and passageways.\nThe most common cause of closed pneumothorax is called spontaneous pneumothorax. The cause of spontaneous pneumothorax is not known.\nOpen pneumothorax.\nOpen pneumothorax is when air gets into the pleural space from an injury to the chest. This can happen with stab wounds, like from a knife. It can also happen after a gunshot injury. The injury is most dangerous if the wound lets air in when the injured person (or animal) breathes, but does not let it back out. Sometimes this is called a \"sucking chest wound.\""}

Keith struck Belize and Mexico before it died on October 6. Keith killed 24 people and caused $225 million in damage. Most of this damage happened in Belize. It was because it struck Belize while stronger than when it struck Mexico.\nMeteorological history.\nThe beginning of the hurricane was from a tropical wave that moved into the Atlantic Ocean off of Africa on September 16. The wave moved across much of the Caribbean Sea, until September 28, at that time it became Tropical Depression Fifteen. Fifteen moved a little northwest and became Tropical Storm Keith on September 29.\nKeith changed its course and moved west. On September 30 Keith became a hurricane. Keith rapidly gained strength and later on September 30, Keith reached its highest wind speed with which at 140 mph. The hurricane was blocked and was forced to make a loop. \nSince Keith was close to land, the block caused Keith to weaken a lot. On October 2 as a weak hurricane, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize. The next day, Keith made another landfall in Belize, this time in Belize City as a very strong tropical storm.\nKeith moved over Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula and weakened to a tropical depression. Tropical Depression Keith moved off of the Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico, where it quickly became a tropical storm again. \nOn October 4, Keith again became a hurricane. Hurricane Keith made its last landfall in Mexico near Tampico in Tamaulipas on October 5. Keith weakened over Mexico until it finally died on October 6.\nRetirement.\nThe name Keith was retired in the Spring of 2001. The name Kirk was put on the list in 2006, but Kirk was not used, so it must be used again in 2012."}

The Supremes' were known for their doo-wop, pop, soul, and disco.\nThe Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts. They are, to date, America's most successful vocal group, with 12 number one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity. Their success made it possible for future African American R&amp;B and soul musicians to find mainstream success.\nFounding members Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, all came from a public housing project in Detroit. They formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio.\nDuring the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer.

Ross left to pursue a solo career in 1970 and was replaced by Jean Terrell, at which point the group's name reverted to the Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s.

They are the children of Sorcha and Iubdan (formerly Hugh of Harrowfield). Liadan follows in her mothers tradition in learning the healing arts. Niamh has great beauty and is 'expected' to wed Eamonn, a nearby chieftan. Eamonn actually asks for the hand of Liadan, she says that she will give him an answer in one year. While staying at Sevenwaters, Eamonn tells a tale of a recent attack by a band of mercenaries. Upon this attack, all his men were killed, and his life was spared by a man called the Painted Man. He swears that he will kill him. During the festival of Imbolc, a young druid named Ciar\u00e1n tells the story of Aengus \u00d3g and Caer Ibormeith and catches the fancy of Niamh. They are soon having a secret love affair. Liadan discovers their secret during a walk in the forest. When the truth comes out, Ciar\u00e1n leaves the Druids and Sevenwaters and Niamh is forced to marry the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill chieftan, Fionn.\nLiadan goes with her sister on the trip to her new home. On the way back she is kidnapped by an outlaw and brought to the camp of \"The Painted Man\" in order to try to save the life of their smith who was hurt in an accident. She accepts the task and eventually falls in love with Bran, their leader. When Bran finds out that she is the daughter of Hugh of Horrowfield, he sends her back home. When she returns to Sevenwaters, she finds she is pregnant with Bran's child. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann demand that she and her son remain in the forest, but she refuses to comply. With the help of Finbar she realizes that she has his gift of sight and can read and heal the minds of others.\nSean, Liadan's brother and heir to Sevenwaters, wants to buy the Painted Man's fighting men in their long battle for the sacred islands. All of the leaders go to a meeting to discuss the feud with the Britons. Liadan and her sister visit Sean's future bride and Eamonn's sister at his estate called S\u00eddhe Dubh. During this visit Liadan discovers that her sisters husband has been beating her. She uses her mind gifts to help Niamh. With the help of Bran they plan on secretly taking Niamh out of S\u00eddhe Dubh and take her to a Christian nunnery where she can be safe. At the last moment Eamonn and Fionn return and attack Bran and Gull as they escape with Niamh. Eamonn returns from the chase and tells the tale of how Naimh slips on the rocks and fell into the bog and died. All that remained was a cord that Liadan made for Niamh that held a white stone given to her by Ciar\u00e1n.\nLiadan finally gives birth to her son. Her mother and father realize when the child is born that his father (Bran) must have been the son of John and Margery, kinsman of Iubdan when he was Lord of Horrowfield. Liadan names the child Johnny. Shortly after the birth of Johnny, Sorcha dies. But before her death Liadan tells Sorcha, Iubdin and Finbar the story of Niamh's abuse by her husband; the escape from S\u00eddhe Dubh with the help of Bran; and her belief that Niamh is not dead. On her deathbed Sorcha tells Iubdin that he must return to Harrowfield and learn the truth about John and Margery's son. Ciar\u00e1n returned in hiding as a tinker during the ceremory for Sorcha. He tells Liadan that Niamh is indeed alive and safe. He also tells her the truth of why they could not wed. Ciar\u00e1n is the son of Lord Colum and the Lady Oonah, he is half brother to Niamh's mother. So their union was forbidden by blood. This was why they were not allowed to wed and that he could never be a druid since he carried the blood of the sorceress Lady Oonah. Ciar\u00e1n gives Liadan a gift for helping rescue Niamh for her abusive husband and returning her to Ciar\u00e1n, a mysterious raven named Fiacha.\nBran comes to Sevenwaters in secret to meet with Sean and meets Liadan, she tells him of his son. After Bran leaves, Liadan has a vision of her Uncle Liam's death; a vision of Eamonn telling Aisling that she could not marry Sean and then her suicide. They then learn that Fionn was recently killed in his sleep. Liam was indeed killed by a Britons arrow and his nephew Sean takes control of Sevenwaters. Sean fearful for Aisling convinces Liadan to go to S\u00eddhe Dubh to bring Aisling back so they can be married. Liadan has had visions of Eamonn torturing Bran. When she arrives at S\u00eddhe Dubh she learns from Eamonn that he indeed has Bran held prisoner. She makes a deal with Eamonn, in exchange for not revealing that Eamonn betrayed his kinsman Liam and sacrificed his life in exchange for the Painted Man capture. Aisling will be allowed to go Sevenwaters and Liadan can leaves with Bran and Gull if she can find them and leave before dusk. With the help of some magic and Fiacha they make it safely through the bog that surrounds S\u00eddhe Dubh. Liadan learns Bran's hidden truth about his childhood during her fight to bring him back from the torture inflicted on him. She reveals this to her father Iubdin and she convinces Bran that his future might lie in returning to his roots at Harrowfield in Briton, while his men talk of setting up a school for warriors.\nLiterary significance and reception.\nPublishers Weekly said that \"The story, though a bit light on the magic and heavy on the romantic, is reminiscent of Jennifer Roberson's Chesuli series.

Turnbull had agreed to allow the government's emissions trading scheme (ETS) to pass through the parliament. This was opposed by many people in the Liberal Party who argued that an ETS was unnecessary. Other people in the party thought an ETS would harm Australia's coal exports. Others in the party did not like the way that Turnbull managed the arguments within his party.\nTurnbull was elected in his full-term Prime Minister position in the 2016 federal election.

It was released on December 10, 1999 in the United States. It stars Tom Hanks, David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, and Michael Clarke Duncan. It was directed by Frank Darabont.\nPlot summary.\nIn Louisiana in 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row \"The Green Mile\" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (played by Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate arrives: John Coffey (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is to be executed for the murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (played by David Morse) and Stanton (played by Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing, like bringing a dead mouse back to life, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have done the crimes with which he was charged.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Green mile\" is said to \"metaphorically\" represent the short distance of land (therefore the use of the word \"mile\") that a prisoner need to walk or otherwise run before he or she are executed on prison grounds.\nAwards.\n1999 Academy Awards\n2000 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films\n2000 Broadcast Music Incorporated Film &amp; TV Awards\n2000 Black Reel Awards\n2000 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards\n2000 Bram Stoker Awards\n2000 Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards\n2000 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards\n2000 Directors Guild of America\n2000 Golden Globe Awards\n2000 NAACP Image Awards\n2000 MTV Movie Awards\n2000 Motion Picture Sound Editors (Golden Reel Awards)\n2000 People's Choice Awards\n2001 Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (Nebula Award)\n2000 Screen Actors Guild Awards"}

Headscarves may be worn for a variety of purposes, such as for warmth, for sanitation, for fashion or social distinction; with religious significance, to hide rampant baldness, out of modesty, or other forms of social convention.\nTypes of headscarves.\nHeadscarves may have specific religious significance. Observant married Orthodox Jewish women, for example, are required to cover their hair, often employing scarves (or sometimes wigs) for the purpose. Headscarves were also worn by married Christian women in Medieval Europe, and even among some of the unmarried. This headcovering habit is better known as a wimple in English.\nIslamic law says that women should dress in a special way. This dress code applies to women and adolescent girls, but not to children.\nHeadscarves and veils used for Muslim religious dress include:\nNote that the Arabic word \"hijab\" refers to modest behaviour in general, and pertains to men and women, but it is sometimes used in other languages to describe the Muslim headscarf, also known as a \"khimar\".\nSome English speakers use the word \"babushka\" (grandma in Russian) to indicate the headscarf tied below the chin, as commonly worn in Eastern Europe. In most parts of Eastern Europe, headscarves are used mainly by elderly women (grandmothers) and this led the incorrect use of the \"babushka\" term. In Russia they are worn by women when they go to church to show their convictions to Russian Orthodoxy.\nA plain red or scarlet headscarf was worn by female commissars and other women aligning themselves with Bolshevism in times of Russian Revolution and civil war.\nA head tie is a west and southern African women's head scarf, specifically an elaborate ornamental head covering.\nThe Keffiyeh is commonly used by Muslim men.\nAncien Egyptiant men wore a Nemes headcloth."}

He was the 20th Prime Minister of Canada from 1993 to 2003 and the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1990 to 2003. During his career, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada for over 35 years.\nChr\u00e9tien was born in Shawinigan, Quebec. He studied law at Universit\u00e9 Laval. He became a politician in 1963, when he was first elected to the House of Commons. While Pierre Trudeau was Prime Minister, Chr\u00e9tien was a member of his cabinet. He was the Minister of Justice, Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. He was also the Deputy Prime Minister when John Turner was Prime Minister.\nChr\u00e9tien was elected leader of the Liberal Party in 1990. The Liberals won 177 seats in the House of Commons in the 1993 election, meaning they were the largest party and could form a government. He was re-elected two times in 1997 and 2000 and led a majority government the entire time he was Prime Minister.\nChr\u00e9tien retired in 2003. He was replaced as the Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party by Paul Martin.\nBeginning of career.\nFor the 1963 federal election, Chr\u00e9tien was chosen to be the Liberal Party's candidate for the riding of Saint-Maurice\u2014Lafl\u00e8che in Shawinigan. He was elected in this riding and became a Member of Parliament for the first time. After this, he became the parliamentary secretary for the Prime Minister at the time, Lester B. Pearson.\nBeginning in 1966, he was the parliamentary secretary for Mitchell Sharp, who was the Minister of Finance at the time. He spent a longer amount of time working with Sharp than he did with Pearson.\nChr\u00e9tien was chosen by Pearson to be the Minister of National Revenue in January 1968.\nIn Trudeau's second cabinet.\nThe Liberal Party lost the 1979 federal election. The Progressive Conservatives formed a very short government led by Joe Clark. After Trudeau and the Liberals won the election the year after, Trudeau chose Chr\u00e9tien to become the Minister of Justice.\nChr\u00e9tien was a very important person in the 1980 Quebec referendum, when there was a referendum on whether Quebec should leave Canada. He fought very hard for the federal government and was against Quebec leaving Canada.\nAs Leader of the Opposition.\nTurner stopped being the leader of the Liberal Party in 1990. There was an election to decide who would be the person to replace him at the June 1990 party conference.\nWhen Chr\u00e9tien won the Liberal Party leadership election, the Liberals had the second-most seats in the House of Commons. Because of this, he also became the Leader of the Opposition. At first, he had many problems as the leader. For example, some Quebec Liberal MPs chose to leave the party after he became the leader.\nPrime Minister, 1993\u20132003.\n1993 election.\nWhen Brian Mulroney retired in 1993, he was replaced as the Prime Minister and as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party by Kim Campbell. She was a part of Mulroney's cabinet at the time. Because elections in Canada have to happen at least once every five years, there was going to be an election in October of that year.\nOne of Chr\u00e9tien's promises was that a Liberal government would remove the Goods and Service Tax. It was created by Mulroney's government and was not very popular among the Canadian public. Chr\u00e9tien also promised that they would negotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) a second time, and to bring down Canada's deficit.\nChr\u00e9tien and the Liberal Party won the election. The Liberals won 177 seats and became the largest party in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives lost almost all their seats in that election, winning only two seats.\nPolitical views.\nChr\u00e9tien was part of the Liberal Party's left-wing in the beginning of his career. While he was Prime Minister, however, he was very neoliberal and fiscally conservative.\nPersonal life.\nHis parents were Wellie Chr\u00e9tien and Marie Boisvert.\nChr\u00e9tien married Aline Cha\u00een\u00e9 in 1957. They both knew each other when they were young in Shawinigan. Cha\u00een\u00e9 became one of the people Chr\u00e9tien trusted the most when making important decisions. They stayed married until she died in 2020. They had 2 sons and 1 daughter."}

She was one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was a mix of either a Siberian Husky or other Nordic breed, and a terrier. NASA refers to Laika as a \"part-Samoyed terrier.\" A dog was sent into space to get information about the behavior of living organisms in a space environment. Information from the flight led to the discovery of solar (from the sun) and cosmic radiation.\nLaika had been a stray dog living in the streets of Moscow. She underwent training with two other dogs. She was then chosen as the dog to go up in the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2. It was launched into outer space on November 3, 1957.\nFate of Laika known.\nNot much was known about how spaceflight would affect living animals at the time of Laika's mission. There was also no way, at that time, to bring the satellite back down to Earth. So all the scientists knew there would be no way for Laika to survive her trip. It was necessary to send a dog first as a test, because it was not thought that humans could live in outer space.\nBefore her trip in Sputnik, one of the scientists took Laika home to play with his children. Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky wrote: \"Laika was quiet and charming...I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.\"\nOne of the technicians getting the capsule ready before final lift-off said that \"after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her \"bon voyage\", knowing that she would not survive the flight.\"\nDeath in space.\nLaika died within hours from overheating. Her body temperature got way too hot for her to survive. The heat in her spacecraft had quickly risen to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The true cause and time of her death were hidden from people until 2002. Instead, it was reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six. Another untruth, as the Soviet government first said, was that she was euthanised (put to sleep) before her oxygen ran out.\nIn the Soviet Union, during the following years, no one openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. It was not until 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that Oleg Gazenko, one of the top-level scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, said he was sorry for allowing her to die:\nReturn to Earth.\nOver five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2 burned up\u2014along with Laika's remains\u2014during re-entry on April 14, 1958.\nMemorials and tribute.\nOn April 11, 2008, Russian officials opened a monument to Laika.

It is of a dog standing on top of a rocket.\nShe also appears on the Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow.\nLaika &amp; the Cosmonauts, a Finnish surf rock band, were named for Laika.

The origin of the civil law system of law is ancient Rome. The civil law system is used in countries such as Germany, France, many countries which were colonies of those European countries before, and in some Asian countries. It also been adopted in Latin America as well as in some parts of Asia and some African countries. There are about 150 countries worldwide that use mainly civil law systems. About 80 countries use the common law system.\nHistory.\nCivil law's very name indicates where it started. Called is was the civil law during the Roman Republic and the later Roman Empire. It started in the 2nd century BC. By the end of the Republic, about 27 BC, a number of experts in the law called \"jurists\" (not to be confused with judges) became prominent. They were mostly members of the upper classes. Jurists provided their services to counsel people and advise judges who presided over trials. An important feature of Roman law was it did not depend on legal precedent by earlier cases but on the facts and merits of the current case.\nIn the 6th century, Justinian compiled the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\", a simplified code of Roman laws. It was used by the Byzantine Empire. The medieval Church based much of its Canon law on Roman law.\nGermanic law, known as \"leges barbarorum\", written between the 5th and 9th centuries borrows from the Roman civil law.\nCivil law developed in Europe during the middle age, about the same time common law developed in England. During the Renaissance, England's common law system borrowed from civil law. While the common law was the traditional law system in England by this time, Equity is based on civil law. Other features were borrowed and used in maritime law and in wills, trusts and estates. The Napoleonic Code, which borrowed much from Roman law, influenced many of the legal systems in Europe and was the foundation for Prussian civil law.\nFeatures.\nCivil law is based on rules and concepts that come from Roman law. The rules and principles of civil law are found in codes which are available to both citizens and legal professionals. These legal codes clearly explain everyone's rights and duties. Unlike common law, in civil law judges have a different role. In criminal cases they establish the facts of a case and use the applicable codes. In many countries, judges also bring the formal charges. Unlike common law, legal precedent is not used to rule in later cases. In this system the legislature passes statutes that are then applied by the courts. Judges look to the statutes instead of precedent in deciding a case.\nSubgroups.\nThe term \"civil law\" comes from English legal scholarship and is used in English-speaking countries to lump together all legal systems of the \"jus commune\" tradition. However, legal comparativists and economists promoting the legal origins theory prefer to subdivide civil law jurisdictions into four distinct groups:"}

Anderson divorced Cornelia in 1916 and got married to Tennessee Mitchell.\nIn 1916, Anderson\u2019s first book, \"Windy McPherson\u2019s Son\", was released. In 1919, Anderson\u2019s most famous book, \"Winesburg, Ohio\", was released. \"Winesburg, Ohio\" was a collection of short stories about life in a town in Ohio.\nIn 1922, Anderson divorced Tennessee Mitchell. He got married again in 1924, to Elizabeth Prall. This marriage did not last either. Anderson married again in the late 1920s \u2013 this time to Eleanor Copenhaver. \nAnderson died in Panama on the 8th March, 1941, at the age of 64. He was buried in Marion, Virginia. The writing on his gravestone reads \"Life, Not Death, is the Great Adventure.\""}

The equations are named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. The equations happen when you apply Newton's second law to fluid dynamics with the guess that the stress, or internal forces, comes from the sum of a diffusing viscous term (based on which way the velocity is changing), plus a pressure term.\nThey are very useful because many important things flow. Scientists and engineers use the equations in mathematical models of weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe, how air flows around a wing, and how stars move inside a galaxy. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Together with Maxwell's equations (the equations for electricity and magnetism) they can be used to model and study how things that can flow and conduct electricity can produce (and react to) magnetic fields.\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given how useful these equations are, mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist, or that if they do exist, then they do not contain any bad points where they become infinite. These are called the Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics, and offered a US$1,000,000 prize (approx. \u20ac0.7M or \u00a30.6M as of September 2009) for a solution or a counter-example.\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations dictate not position but rather velocity (how fast the fluid is going and where it is going). A solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field, which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time. Once the velocity field is solved for, other quantities of interest (such as flow rate or drag force) may be found. This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics, where solutions are typically paths of a particle over time. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid, but for visualization purposes one also can compute various paths that a particle could flow along."}

In 1726 she tricked doctors into believing that she had given birth to rabbits. She became famous, and was taken to London. There she was examined by royal doctors. Later she confessed, and was sent to prison.\nToft became pregnant in 1726, but later miscarried. She had developed a strong interest in a rabbit she had seen while working, and claimed to have given birth to parts of animals. Local surgeon John Howard was called to see if it was true, and upon delivering several animal parts he told other important doctors. The event came to the attention of Nathaniel St. Andr\u00e9, surgeon to the Royal Household of King George I of Great Britain. St.\u00a0Andr\u00e9 checked further into the event and decided that Toft was telling the truth. The king also sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers to see Toft, but Ahlers did not believe it. By now quite famous, Toft was brought to London and was studied at length. She was watched closely. She produced no more rabbits, and eventually confessed to the hoax and was sent to prison as a fraud.\nThe public learned of the fact that the doctors had been fooled, and this created panic in the medical profession. Several important surgeons' careers were ruined. Pamphlets were published which made fun of the doctors, and William Hogarth was very critical of the profession. Toft was eventually released without charge and returned to her home."}

Some families from the Canary Islands came to live here. Because it was too dry and hot, there was not possibility of any kind of farming, except some cattle raising, and the city was developed as a port.\nThe town was destroyed in 1606 by order of the Spanish government and the inhabitants were moved, together with the inhabitants of Puerto Plata inhabitants, away from the northern coast to form the new town of Monte Plata. In 1751, Monte Cristi was founded again by order of the king Ferdinand VI of Spain.\nGeography.\nMonte Cristi is in the northwestern end of the Cibao Valley, near the Montecristi Bay.

Users use any device with an internet connection and a web browser to send and to read messages, called \"tweets\". For years, tweets could be up to 140 characters long, then doubled in November 2017 to 280 characters. They appear on the user's profile page. Tweets can usually be read by anyone, but senders can also keep messages private. Private tweets only go to their list of friends. Users may subscribe to tweets from other people. This is called \"following\", and subscribers are known as \"followers\". As of late 2009, users can also follow lists of authors.\nAll users can send and receive tweets using the Twitter website. They can also use other applications that work with Twitter on smartphones. Twitter by Short Message Service (SMS) is available in certain countries. Using Twitter is free, but sending or getting tweets by SMS may cost money. The website is based in San Francisco, California. Twitter also has servers and offices in San Antonio, Texas and Boston, Massachusetts, and soon in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nTwitter has become very popular worldwide since Jack Dorsey created it in 2006. It now has more than 126 million users. It is sometimes described as the \"SMS of the Internet.\"\nHistory.\nTwitter started at a podcasting company Odeo. The company board members had a \"daylong brainstorming session.\" During the meeting, Jack Dorsey introduced the idea of one person using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. At first, they called this project \"twttr\". It fit the five-character length of American SMS short codes and sounded like \"Flickr\". At first, the developers planned to use \"10958\" as a short code. Later they changed it to \"40404\" because it was easier to remember and type. Dorsey sent the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) March 21, 2006. The first tweet was, \"just setting up my twttr.\"\nThe first version of Twitter was only for Odeo employees to use. They opened the full version for anyone to use on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo started a new company called Obvious Corporation. Obvious Corporation bought Odeo and all of its property\u2013including Odeo.com and Twitter.com\u2013from the investors and shareholders. Twitter became its own separate company in April 2007.\nTwitter started becoming very popular after the 2007 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000\u00a0tweets per day to 60,000. The Twitter company set up two very large computer screens in the hallways at the conference. These screens only showed Twitter messages. Hundreds of people at the conference checked on what each other were doing by looking at the many tweets. Panelists and speakers talked about Twitter. Bloggers at SXSW described it to others in a very positive way.\nReaction at the festival was very good. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter \"absolutely rul[ed]\" SXSW. Social software researcher Danah Boyd said Twitter \"own[ed]\" the festival. Twitter staff won the festival's Web Award prize. They said, \"we'd like to thank you in 140\u00a0characters or less. And we just did!\"\nOn September 14, 2010, Twitter changed the site design and added a new logo.\nOn October 4, 2010, Evan Williams announced that he would not be CEO any more. Dick Costolo became the new CEO. He had been COO of Twitter. Williams will stay with the company and work on plans for the future of Twitter.\nOverview.\nTechnology author Steven Johnson described the basic way Twitter works. He called it \"remarkably simple.\" Following is an important part of Twitter as a social network. Users' Twitter home pages show all of the tweets from people they follow. The tweets appear from newest to oldest. Johnson said:\nPeople who use Twitter.\nTwitter is mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter. Jeremiah Owyang studies social media. He said, \"Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years.\" Only 11% of Twitter's users were 12 to 17 years old in September 2009. This may be because Twitter first gained popularity in businesses and news media that attract more older people. Many famous people such as Shaq, Britney Spears, and Ashton Kutcher are Twitter users.\nIn June 2009, more women than men used Twitter\u201453% women; 47% men. Only 5% of users made 75% of all tweets. Also, New York City had the most Twitter users.\nThis is a brief summary of Twitter users as of 3 September 2009.\nPopularity.\nTwitter is one of the 10 most visited websites in the world.\nLogging in.\nPeople can use software from other companies to access Twitter. These programs are called \"third-party applications\". The Twitter company changed the way this works on 31 August 2010. Now applications must use OAuth to connect to Twitter. This method means that users do not have to give their passwords to the third-party applications. Changing the login system to OAuth did cause some problems. Using OAuth had been optional and programs used to be able to ask for usernames and passwords. However, now third-party applications that try to use a username and password do not work at all. The Twitter company said that using OAuth will give users \"increased security and a better experience.\"\nTechnology.\nInterface.\nOn April 30, 2009, Twitter changed the way it looks on the web. They added a search bar and a space on the right side of the page with \"Trending Topics\". That space shows the most common phrases appearing in messages. Biz Stone explained that all messages are instantly indexed and explained the results of the change. The Trending Topics has made Twitter something \"unexpectedly important \u2014 a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now.\"\nService problems.\nSometimes Twitter users experience a problem with the service and cannot access the website. They cannot read or write tweets but only see the \"Fail Whale\" image created by Yiying Lu,\nTwitter worked well approximately 98% of the time in 2007. That is about six full days of no service. The problems were particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo keynote address.\nOpen source.\nTwitter developed several software projects to improve their own service. The company shared these as open source software. Some of these software projects are related to databases, such as the Gizzard Scala framework and a distributed graph database called FlockDB.\nt.co.\nt.co is a service created by Twitter to make URLs shorter. It can only be used for links that people post to Twitter. It is not available for other uses. Eventually all links on Twitter will use t.co. The company hopes that the service will protect users from harmful websites. They will also use it to keep a record of people clicking on links in tweets.\nHistory.\nTwitter had used the services from other sites such as TinyURL and bit.ly. They began trying their own way of making URLs shorter for direct messages in March 2010. They used the domain, twt.tl, before they bought the t.co domain.\nThe company is using these accounts to test the service on the main site: @TwitterAPI, @rsarver, and @raffi.\nOn 2 September 2010, Twitter sent an email message to users to explain that they were starting to open the service to them.\nOther.\nTwitter can also be used as an amateur and professional news source."}

A \"microblogger\" (someone who uses a microblog) could send their messages from different sources including cell phone text messages, email, instant messages or through a website. \nA microblog is usually different from a normal blog. It has much smaller pieces. A microblog entry can be just one sentence, or a link to an image or short video. A person writing a microblog can use many ideas from \"what am I doing now,\" to Race cars or politics or information about their business or personal life.\nServices.\nMicro blogs are in use in many ways on different websites. They became popular with sites like Twitter where people send messages to each other with text comments or links to other media. Newer sites are also available now which allow you to share media like videos, pictures or sounds directly instead of sending a link. \nMany social networking sites (such as Facebook or MySpace) use a type of microblogging using \"status updates\" where the person tells their friends what they are thinking or doing. \nUsage.\nA Harvard Business School study found that while most social networking websites are more popular with women microblogging, like Twitter, has been much more popular with men. Both men and women \"followed\" more men, this allows them to receive the messages that get sent out by the person they followed. \nMicro blogs have also become new sources for news that just happened or is still happening, such as the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in November 2008.\nMicroblogging at work.\nA new idea for Micro blogging has been to turn it into a way to talk to other people about work. It allows a person to give quick news or information to the people they work without sending a lot of emails and without the spam they get in their email account. New companies such as Yammer have been started who want to help allow workers to talk to each other with about work and share what they need. "}

One thing is that people can chat using webcams. Another feature is that one person can ask something while watching two other strangers discussing it. Usually, the asker can't talk, but they can watch them discuss the question. One new feature that people can do is use Facebook Connect to find strangers who have liked the same things on Facebook. You can also type in common interests, these will only connect you to people who have the same interests.\nCriticism.\nThe website does not ban users because of their age. A user may experience nudity or sexual content on camera. K-Brooks says, that at one time, he felt \"disappointment\" at the way in which the site has been used.\nSince 2013, Omegle has monitored the video chats. There is a moderated video section and an unmoderated video section. The unmoderated video section is for adults who are 18 and over. The moderated video section is for everyone.

It is produced by Alan Ball and stars Anna Paquin as the main character, Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress who can hear people's thoughts. The story is based on the novels \"The Southern Vampire Mysteries\" written by Charlaine Harris. Most of the events of the TV show occur is a small town in Louisiana named Bon Temps. Although there are other places, like Mississippi, this is one of the main places the show is centered around. On July 15, 2013, it was announced by HBO that the show was renewed for a seventh and final season and would premiere on June 22, 2014.\nPlot.\nTwo years before the present (what the viewer sees now), vampires \"came out of the coffin\" (a coined phrase of \"coming out of the closet\"). After the creation of fake blood (called Tru Blood), vampires are allowed to enter the open and interact with humans (which is called \"mainstreaming\") more often. They can only come out at night, however (unlike Twilight, vampires will burn to death, until they are a pile of ashes, if they step out into the sunlight). The show is mostly centered around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepath, better known as a person who can hear the thoughts of others, and how her life changes after she meets vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer).\nSeries overview.\n2008 - Season 1:\nSookie is a waitress for Merlotte's, a bar owned by her boss, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammel). A rather lousy couple enters the bar, in Sookie's section. She serves them, and when a vampire enters the bar, the heads turn. She accidentely reads the rather rude couple's mind, and hears them both think that when they leave the bar, they will drain the vampire of his blood, a rather expensive substance used and seen as a drug in the series. Sookie leaves in a haste to stop them, and actually does save him. Something rather strange happens (Sookie gains the man's attention by throwing a chain around his neck, and it seems to squeeze itself around him and stay there), it is shrugged off. The woman, speaking for both of them, vows revenge on Sookie for getting in the way and runs off, with her male counterpart trailing behind her.\nShe removes small chains of silver off of him (which leads her to realize that one of a vampire's weaknesses is silver), and he thanks her, before she ends up pulling him out the way when the evil duo try to run him over with their truck. Because she works hard to shut the thoughts of other people out, she finds a surprise when she discovers she cannot hear Bill's thoughts. She learns that Bill is from an old time, and that he inherited his old family house from several hundred years ago."}

He soon became known at school as someone who was good at making people laugh. He learned to sing lots of songs and accompanied himself on the banjolele.\nWhen he wanted to study at university he applied for a choral scholarship at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, but he was not offered a place there, so he went to Trinity Hall. There he studied law and was known for the jokes that he played on people. He also had singing lessons.\nWallace wanted to go into music theatre, but the war broke out and he joined the army. Then he was ill with tuberculosis, but it did not stop him from singing to the people in the hospital.\nHe took a long time to get better. Gradually he started working in music theatre and then he got a chance to sing in opera. His voice was a bass baritone. He sang with the New London Opera Company in operas such as \"La boh\u00e8me\" and \"The Barber of Seville\". From 1948 to 1961, he regularly sang at Glyndebourne. He usually sang comic parts (known as \u201cbuffo roles). \nIn 1948 he married Patricia Black. It was a long and happy marriage. The couple adopted two children. \nThe Glyndebourne season took place in the summer, so he had plenty of time to do other things the rest of the year. He sang in operas in the BBC studios and often appeared in pantomimes. Then he started to take part in a radio programme called \u201cMy Music\u201d. Together with Frank Muir, Dennis Norden, David Franklin and Steve Race he made this programme extremely popular. It was a kind of lighthearted quiz programme with lots of stories and laughter. Wallace was particularly known for singing a song called \u201cThe Hippopotamus\u201d by Flanders and Swann.\nWallace continued to sing in opera in the mid-1960s. He sang the roles of Leporello (in \"Don Giovanni\") and Pistol (in Verdi\u2019s \"Falstaff\"). He acted on television and in films and appeared at many charity events. He was always very cheerful and friendly and he was liked by a lot of people.\nHe wrote two autobiographies: \"Promise Me You'll Sing Mud\" and \"Nothing Quite Like It\"."}

In graph theory, a tree is a way of connecting all the vertices together, so that there is exactly one path from any one vertex, to any other vertex of the tree. If the graph represents a number of cities connected by roads, one could select a number of roads, so that each city can be reached from every other, but that there is no more than one way to travel from one city to another.\nA graph can have more than one spanning tree, just like there may be more than one way to select the roads between the cities.\nMost of the time, graphs are weighted; each connection between two cities has a weight: It might cost something to travel on a given road, or one connection may be longer than the other, this means it takes more time to travel on that connection. In the language of graph theory, the connections are called \"edges\". \nA minimum spanning tree is a tree. It is different from other trees in that it minimizes the total of the \"weights\" attached to the edges. Depending on what the graph looks like, there may be more than one minimum spanning tree. In a graph where all the edges have the same weight, every tree is a minimum spanning tree. If all the edges have different weights (that is: there are no two edges with the same weight), there is exactly one minimal spanning tree. \nFinding the minimum spanning tree.\nA first try.\nIt can be very simple to make an algorithm that will discover a minimum spanning tree:\n function MST(\"G\",\"W\"):\n while \"T\" does not form a spanning tree:\n find the minimum weighted edge in \"E\" that is safe for \"T\"\n return \"T\"\nIn this case, \"safe\" means that including the edge does not form a cycle in the graph. A cycle means starting at a vertex, travelling to a number of other vertices and ending up at the starting point again without using the same edge twice.\nHistory.\nCzech scientist Otakar Bor\u016fvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, in 1926. He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity. Today, this algorithm is known as Bor\u016fvka's algorithm.\nTwo other algorithms are commonly used today. One of them was developed by Vojt\u011bch Jarn\u00edk in 1930, and put in practice by Robert Clay Prim in 1957. Edsger Wybe Dijkstra rediscovered it in 1959, and called it Prim's algorithm. The other algorithm is called Kruskal's algorithm, and was pulbished by Joseph Kruskal in 1956. All three algorithms are greedy, and run in polynomial time. \nThe fastest minimum spanning tree algorithm to date was developed by Bernard Chazelle. The algorithm is based on the soft heap,\nan approximate priority queue.\nIts running time is \"O\"(\"m\"\u00a0\u03b1(\"m\",\"n\")), where \"m\" is the number of edges, \"n\" is the number of vertices and \u03b1 is the classical functional inverse of the Ackermann function. The function \u03b1 grows extremely slowly, so that for all practical purposes it may be considered a constant no greater than 4; thus Chazelle's algorithm takes very close to linear time. \nWhat is the fastest possible algorithm for this problem? That is one of the oldest open questions in computer science. There is clearly a linear lower bound, since we must at least examine all the weights. If the edge weights are integers with a bounded bit length, then deterministic algorithms are known with linear running time.\nFor general weights, there are randomized algorithms whose \"expected\" running time is linear.\nThe problem can also be approached in a distributed manner. If each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links, one can still calculate the distributed minimum spanning tree."}

It was first established as the 'WWF European Championship'. The first and longest reigning champion, The British Bulldog became the first Champion after winning a tournament that was held over several shows in Germany, culminating in a finals victory over Owen Hart. When Shawn Michaels won the belt, it made him the first Grand Slam Champion in WWE. Michaels was and still is the only wrestler to have held both the WWF Championship and the European title at the same time. The title was on a brief hiatus in 1999 due to then-champion Shane McMahon's wanting to retire an \"undefeated champion\". The WWE European Championship was retired in a ladder match on July 22, 2002 when Rob Van Dam put his WWE Intercontinental Championship on the line, along with Jeff Hardy's European Championship in a winner-take-all type match. When RVD won the match he merged the two titles together, and continued to hold the Intercontinental Title. RVD's title reign is not listed in the official European title history on WWE's official website, and therefore he is not credited with being a Eurocontinental Champion, but is mentioned in RVD's profile."}

{"id": "208163", "revid": "7482993", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208163", "title": "Trouble (Coldplay song)", "text": "\"Trouble\" is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was composed for their first album, \"Parachutes\". The band wrote the song and produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson. The word \"trouble\" is repeated many times in the lyrics of the song.\nThe song was released on 26 October 2000 as a single. It was the third single of the album. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. This made it the band's second Top 10 single in the country. \"Trouble\" did not chart on the main singles chart in the United States. But the music press said it was almost as successful as \"Yellow\". \"Yellow\" was the single released before \"Trouble\". Two different music videos for the single were released.\nProduction.\nChris Martin, the vocalist of Coldplay said that inspiration for writing \"Trouble\" came from his own behaviour. Martin said that there were \"some bad things going in our band\u00a0... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band.\" The four members of Coldplay are credited as the co-writers of \"Trouble\". But, it was based on Martin's idea.\nBritish record producer Ken Nelson and the band produced \"Trouble\" for their first album, \"Parachutes\". The song was recorded four times before the band got the recording they liked most. The band decided that the first three versions were not \"working\". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker. This was done to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin played the piano. It was recorded in a little wooden room. Guy Berryman recorded the bass and then guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones. Nelson, who wanted to keep the song simple, chose the microphone which had a fuller sound for the mixing.\n\"Trouble\" was mixed in New York by American mix engineer Michael Brauer. The first mixed version was sent back to the band and Nelson. However, it was not as good as they wanted and had to be mixed again. Nelson found some problems in the version. In spite of this, he did not blame Brauer because he was not present during the mixing. This was because they were recording the album at that time.\nComposition.\nLike in the song \"Yellow\", in this song the word trouble is used many times. The song's lyrics have \"softer emotional themes\". This includes apologies and unrequited love, and longing.\nThe song has a minimalistic approach. The song is mainly built around a piano. It has a snare drum in the background. The sound of the drum was mixed very low. The snare drum cannot be heard when the guitar is played. The song has a tempo of 70 beats per minute. Martin's vocal range in the song is from F4 to A5, the highest note being sung using his falsetto voice.\nRelease.\n\"Trouble\" was released on 26 October 2000 in the United Kingdom, and on 18 December 2001 in the United States. It was the third single of \"Parachutes\". A limited edition CD of the single was released. It had a remix of the songs \"Yellow\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\". Only 1,000 copies were made. It was given only to fans and journalists.\nColdplay did not accept many offers to use \"Trouble\" for advertisements. In 2004, the band rejected an offer from Diet Coke and Gap to use the song. The offer was worth many million Euros. American actor Sylvester Stallone wanted to use the song for the soundtrack of his 2001 film \"Driven\". But the band declined.\nReception.\n\"Trouble\" was a commercial success. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. This made it the band's second Top 10 single in the UK after \"Yellow\". \"Trouble\" was successful because the previous singles did very well. Also, the album, \"Parachutes\" was very successful in the United Kingdom. The British band Lost Witness made a remixed version of the song. It was released and was successful.\nIn the United States, the single's chart performance was almost as good as \"Yellow\"s. It reached number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Top 40 and 28 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks. Martin has said the single had saved them from being a \"one-hit wonder\" band. The band thought it was not a \"great single\". They felt it would not do well in the United States.\nMusic videos.\nThe original European version of the music video for \"Trouble\" was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. Its theme was the Wild West.\nThe music video also had a U.S. version. This was directed by Tim Hope who won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002 for the video. It was also nominated for \"Breakthrough Video\". The video is similar to \"Don't Panic\"."}

In 1927 they united with Allenby F.C and created the club in its modern form. The club is part of the Hapoel Sport Organisation, which is connected with the Histadrut trade union. Until the independence of Israel in 1948 the club often won the Palestine League (5 titles). After the independence Hapoel joined the Israeli League. In 1988-1989 they were relegated to the second league for the first time of their existence. Next year they came back. Since 1948 they have won 8 national titles. Overall they have won 13 national titles and 13 State Cups. They have had many big successes in international football, for example the victory in the first Asian Club Championship in 1967, beating Red Bull Salzburg and Benfica in the 2010-11 Champions League, and finishing first in their group in the 2010-11 Europa League.\nCurrent squad.\n\"As of 30 January 2020\"\nForeigners 2019\u201320.\nOnly up to six non-Israeli nationals can be in an Israeli club, but only five can play at the same time on the pitch.

The idea is that quantum computers can use certain ideas from quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. The basic principle behind quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform operations on it. A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine, also known as the universal quantum computer.\nThe idea of quantum computing is still very new. Experiments have been done. In these, a very small number of operations were done on qubits (quantum bit). Both practical (meaning in the real world) and theoretical (meaning just thinking) research continues with interest, and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and military purposes, such as cryptanalysis, or breaking codes.\nToday's computers, called \"classical\" computers, store information in binary; each bit is either on or off. Quantum computation use qubits, which, in addition to being possibly on or off, can be both on and off, which is a way of describing superposition, until a measurement is made. The state of a piece of data on a normal computer is known with certainty, but quantum computation uses probabilities. Only very simple quantum computers have been built, although larger designs have been invented. Quantum computation uses a special type of physics, quantum physics.\nIf large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve some problems much more quickly than any computer that exists today (such as Shor's algorithm). Quantum computers are different from other computers such as DNA computers and traditional computers based on transistors. Some computing architectures such as optical computers may use classical superposition of electromagnetic waves. Without quantum mechanical resources such as entanglement, people think that an exponential advantage over classical computers is not possible. Quantum computers cannot perform functions that are not theoretically computable by classical computers, in other words they do not alter the Church-Turing thesis. They would, however, be able to do many things much more quickly and efficiently."}

He was the managing director of Apple Corps, a company started by The Beatles. He had earlier served as the band's road manager.\nAspinall was born in Prestatyn, North Wales and grew up in Liverpool, England. He was an Accountancy student and lived with the Best family, renting a room in their house. Eldest son Pete Best was a drummer who played for the Beatles. Aspinall owned a van, and began driving the band to their shows, and setting up equipment. In time, they began to pay him for this, and he gave up his studies to be their official road manager.\nDuring 1962 the Beatles changed drummers when Ringo Starr joined, and Pete Best was let go. Aspinall offered to quit also, but he was persuaded to keep working for the Beatles. (He kept a connection to the Best family, having a son, Roag, with Mona Best.) Aspinall was joined by another man, Mal Evans, who shared his job duties.\nOver time, other people helped with setting up and breaking down the Beatles' instruments and equipment, but Aspinall and Evans still supervised them. They also did other jobs, like shopping for the band, delivering important messages, and dealing with members of the public who wanted to meet the band. Some of their lesser-known jobs were choosing female audience members at Beatles concerts to visit the band backstage, and signing Beatles autographs on photographs. (The demand for autographs was too great for the Beatles themselves to meet practically.)\nWhen the Beatles stopped giving concerts, they put time into forming their own company, which became Apple Corps. Aspinall and Evans were both directors at Apple, and personal assistants to the Beatles. None of the band's inner circle knew how to run a large company, and Apple got into financial trouble. Allen Klein and Lee Eastman (Paul McCartney's father-in-law) took over running Apple, and Evans was fired. Aspinall was also supposed to be fired, but the Beatles themselves insisted he be kept on.\nAfter the Beatles disbanded, Apple's business decreased, Klein and Eastman moved on, and Apple was reorganized. Aspinall alone was able to handle most of Apple's ongoing business, which was mostly licensing Beatles-related products, and future issues of Beatles music. He kept working for the band until shortly before his death.\nAspinall's last tasks for Apple included handling a lawsuit against Apple Inc. over iTunes, and supervising a new recording of the whole Beatles music catalogue. Aspinall died of lung cancer in New York City in 2008."}

{"id": "208326", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208326", "title": "Jean Balukas", "text": "Jean Balukas (born June 28, 1959) is an American pool player from Brooklyn, New York. During the 1970s and 1980s, many people thought Balukas was the greatest female player ever. Some people described her as a leader and \"a child prodigy, a loner who rebelled against dress codes for women\u2014the pool equivalent of Billie Jean King\". Balukas was named Billiard Congress of America (BCA) Player of the Year five times. She was the youngest person given an entry in the BCA Hall of Fame. She is only the second woman given that honor. In 1999, Balukas was ranked fifteenth on \"Billiard Digest's\" Fifty Greatest Players of the 20th Century.\nBalukas was thought of as a rare young talent. She first earned some fame when she was six years old by appearing in a pool playing event held at New York City's Grand Central Station. She later appeared many times on television, such as on CBS's popular evening television show, \"I've Got a Secret\". She was nine years old when she placed 5th in the 1969 U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. She placed 4th and 3rd in the next two U.S. Opens. From that early start, Balukas dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s.\nBalukas won the U.S. Open seven years in a row, from 1972 through 1978. She won six world championship titles. She had over 100 professional competition first-place finishes; 38 of those wins were in major events. She had a streak of 16 first-place finishes in women's professional tournaments. Balukas was also the only woman to compete equally with men in professional play in her era. She quit the sport in 1988 because of a dispute that happened in a match at the World Open Nine-ball Championship that year.\nYoung fame.\nJean Balukas's father, Albert Balukas, and his business partner, Frank McGown, owned a forty-eight-table pool hall, named the Ovington Lounge, in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas began playing pool when she four years old. She did not play at her father's pool room. Her first play was on a 4\u00bd\u00a0by\u00a09\u00a0foot pool table in the basement of her childhood home. Her parents bought the table to keep her four brothers out of local pool rooms.\nBalukas played with a cue stick that had ivory details. It was made just for her in 1965 by a cue stick maker, George Balabushka. When she was five and six years old she would practice a game called straight pool to 50 points after family dinners. Her father supported her play.\nIn 1966, McGown held a public billiards exhibition at New York City's Grand Central Terminal. With her parents' permission, he brought along the six-year-old Balukas. Balukas participated in the exhibition. This gained Balukas media attention. Later in 1966, Balukas appeared on a television show called \"Wonderama\". Balukas and her younger sister Laura also appeared on CBS's television show \"I've Got a Secret\" later that year.\nIn 1967, Balukas was in an exhibition match at a pool hall called the Carom Club, located Manhattan. In advertisements for the match, Balukas was described as \"the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards\". A reporter described her at the match as \"a little girl with honey-blond hair...wearing a short yellow dress and green leotards...who resembles a young Shirley Temple\". She beat her adult opponent, Roland DeMarco, with a final score of 50\u00a0to\u00a042.\nIn 1969, at the age of nine, she competed in her first Billiard Congress of America U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. Balukas placed 5th in the competition. All her opponents were adults. In the next two U.S. Opens, in 1970 and 1971, she placed 4th and 3rd, respectively. By that time, Balukas had appeared on other television programs with a number of billiard stars and other celebrities.\nU.S. Open Straight Pool Champion.\nOn August 18, 1972, when she was thirteen years old, Balukas won the women's side of the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. For the win she beat five-time champion Dorothy Wise. The prize was $1,500. Balukas was the U.S Open's youngest winner ever and by a large number of years. She also beat in the finals, Madelyn Whitlow of Detroit, Michigan, with a score of 75 to 32 in 44 innings (turns at the table). Reporting on the competition, \"The New York Times\" described her as a strong player \"throughout the tournament ... as she defeated six opponents with precision shooting and [almost perfect] strategy\".\nIn 1973, at fourteen, Balukas successfully defended her straight pool U.S. Open title. She beat runner-up Donna Ries, a psychologist from Kansas City, Missouri, with a final score of 75 to 72 in 42 innings. In her longest turn, she sank 26 balls in a row and won $2,000 for first place. Earlier in the tournament she beat Mieko Harada, a housewife from Kyoto, Japan. Baluka's score was much higher than Harada's: 75 to 1 in 20 innings and sank 25 balls in a row. In the 1974 U.S. Open held at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago, Balukas defended her title, again beating out Harada, but by a much closer score: 100 to 99. This was Balukas's third U.S. Open title in a row, at the young age of fifteen. The close scores at the end of the match were similar to the results on the men's side, where Joe Balsis defeated Jim Rempe 200 to 199.\nIn 1975, Balukas beat Ries again in the U.S. Open semi-finals with a score of 75 to 15 in 15 innings. She also beat Gail Breedlove of Ames, Iowa, 75 to 19. She then again played and beat Harada in the finals, winning $3,000 with a score of 100 to 63 in 39 innings. In her longest turn, she sank 23 balls. In 1976, then 17, Balukas took her fifth U.S. Open title in a row, beating Gloria Walker of Cheyney, Pennsylvania 75 to 46 in 39 innings and winning a $1,700 prize. Balukas would win the next two U.S. Open straight pool championships for a total of seven wins in a row. Her streak of wins ended after 1978 because the U.S. Open itself was canceled, not because she was beaten.\nBalukas was not only talented at pool but also good at other sports. From age sixteen to eighteen, ABC-TV asked her to be on a show called \"Superstars\". This event happened in Rotonda West, Florida. Top athletes from one sport competed in a different sports that they did not usually compete in. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, Balukas placed second with 192 points. She won titles in tennis and bowling. The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning. Other competitors included: diver Micki King; tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson; skier Kiki Cutter; runner Wyomia Tyus; and tennis champion Martina Navratilova. The second place win was both good and bad for Balukas. She won $13,100 prize money, so she lost amateur standing. Afterwards, she was banned from competing in high school sports. Also, she was not allowed to get a college athletic scholarship.\nBalukas has won many other pool titles, including six at the World Open Pocket Billiard Championships. At her first win in that tournament, held at a convention hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey on August 14, 1977, she was described as \"the 18-year-old prodigy from Brooklyn\". There, she again beat Gloria Walker with a score of 100 to 57, and earned a $1,001 prize. Balukas has won more U.S. Opens than any other player, male or female. The closest male is Steve Mizerak with four wins to Balukas's seven. Her ball average over the seven U.S. Opens was far better than was her opponents'. Balukas averaged 3.44 in 1972 with the next best, Gloria Walker, having an average of 2.37. In 1975 she averaged 4.05, while no other player averaged even 3.\nPlaying against men.\nBy the late 1960s, Balukas was playing in exhibition matches with top male players. For example, she played with Willie Mosconi and Irving Crane who were together considered between 1941 and 1956 the \"best in the world, flat out\". In 1975, she again played Willie Mosconi on CBS's \"Challenge of the Sexes\", playing in games of eight-ball and nine-ball. For the exhibition, the rules were changed to allow Balukas to have an advantage (a practice called \"handicapping\"). Specifically, Balukas always took the first shot. Then, she also took the next shot, even if she did not put a ball in a pocket on the first shot. Balukas beat Mosconi at both games. She would later play \"Battle of the Sexes\" matches on television with Rudolph Wanderone (also known as Minnesota Fats) in 1977, Ray Martin in 1979, and with Steve Mizerak in 1986.\nOn August 6, 1978, Balukas became the first women to qualify to play in the men's side of the World Open Pocket Billiards Championship. This meant that Balukas would be competing in both the women's and men's sides of the tournament. The tournament was to be held on August 12 of that year at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City.\nBalukas played against men in several other competitions. These included at least one first shown on TV on March 25, 1979, between her and men's champion Ray Martin. The match was described on the television schedule as part of a \"Challenge of the Sexes\". Other male-female matchups in the series were between golfers Nancy Lopez and Andy North and co-ed participants in a skateboarding challenge match. During 1980, Balukas again competed in the men's side of the World Open Pocket Billiards championship. That year it was played at New York City's Roosevelt Hotel. She was beaten in the second round by Steve Mizerak with a score of 150 to 93. Her final in the tournament was 22nd. At the end, 42 men were behind her. She also played on the women's side and was the champion. She beat Billie Billings, also from Brooklyn, with a score of 100 to 75.\nBalukas was entered in both the men's and women's divisions of the 1987 B.C. Classic, a nine-ball competition. After controversy, she competed only on the men's side. There, she beat Keith McCready 11 to 3. At that time McCready was the 17th-ranked male player by money list. Balukas finished the tournament by tying for 9th place.\nDress code controversy.\nIn August 1987, at the B.C. Classic held at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was scheduled to play in the men's and women's tournaments. After arriving, she found out that for the nighttime matches, she would be required to wear formal clothing. However, she did not have suitable clothing with her. The men's side had no similar dress code. Thus, Balukas did not buy clothes to follow the rule because she thought it was unfair.\nThe women held a vote on whether Balukas should be allowed to play. The vote resulted in Balukas being banned from the women's tournament. Some people said that the real reason other players voted her out was because they would have a better chance of winning the first place USD $5,000 prize if Balukas did not play. Balukas did not think so. Balukas did compete on the men's side, tying for ninth place.\nSoon after the dress code issue was reported on, the president of the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), Belinda Bearden, sent a letter to \"The New York Times\". Bearden wrote that the facts were different than reported. The WPBA stated the dress code was decided by the women players for themselves. They made the rules to improve the image of women's pool and to attract a larger audience and more press to the sport. They said that Balukas was the only woman at the event who was not willing to follow the rule. They also explained that Balukas first left from the women's division. They said that she came back to play after the list of who would play who was already completed. Another vote on whether she could play went 8\u20137 in Balukas' favor. However, after they asked a player who was absent from the first vote, Balukas withdrew from the women's division of the competition.\nLeaving the sport.\nIn 1988, Balukas was playing another professional player named Robin Bell the Brunswick-sponsored World Open Nine-ball Championship. The tournament was held at Caesars Palace (a casino and hotel) in Las Vegas, Nevada and shown on television. Bell was Balukas's best friend on the women's tour. She had never beaten Balukas before. However, Bell had been playing very strongly in the tournament. The terms of the match were that the winner would be whoever won nine games first. In the game of nine ball, there is a way to win the game very quickly. The game is over and the first player wins if they put the 9 ball in a pocket when they take the first shot. Early in the match the score was 2 games to 3, with Bell winning. Then, Bell sank the 9 ball on the first shot two games in a row, so she won both games. That made the score 5 to 2 very quickly without having to play a complete game. Bell avoided having to match skill with Balukas on each turn.\nAll television match players wore small microphones so that their words and the sounds of play could be heard by the audience. Balukas quietly said to herself that Bell had gotten lucky. The microphone let others hear what Balukas said. The referee spoke to Balukas and told her not to continue talking about Bell. They continued playing. Balukas won the match with a final score of 9 to 5. According to an interview with Balukas by \"New York Woman\" magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were \"Some world championship... beat me with skill, not luck\". Despite Bell and Balukas's friendship, after the match Bell made a formal to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors fined Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nBalukas was angry about the fine. She did not pay it. She turned down offers by others to pay the fine for her. Balukas explained that \"It wasn\u2019t the $200... [Women] pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, were the ones who decided I should be fined. I felt it should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors\". The sides were deadlocked. Balukas to pay and the WPBA refused to cancel the fine. They would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid. \"Just because she was our premier player does not mean she was above the rules\", said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Another professional named Loree Jon Jones was also interviewed. Her feelings were more mixed: \"Her not playing is, I guess, sad\", but she also said that without Balukas playing, \"we've all learned how to win\".\nBalukas had faced other problems before she stopped competing. When she had tried to compete against men as the only woman she heard insults from some men. For example, one said \"I\u2019m gonna put on a dress and go play with the women\". Balukas heard many complaints from the men upon her entry to a Chicago tournament in 1988. They said it was not fair that she got to play on both the men's and women's side, when the men could only play on their own side. She agreed not to play. However, after she traveled to the tournament she learned she had been tricked: \"I found out that the first- and second-place winners in the women\u2019s event were going to be invited to play in the men\u2019s event. I was stabbed in the back\".\nBalukas also admits having been under great pressure, much of it that she placed on herself. After she reached the very top of her profession, \"That's when I started getting nervous... that\u2019s when I started putting a lot of pressure on myself\". \"Playing against the men, I learned to lose... but [losing] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time\". Balukas later said that leaving the sport was a combination of many things, including: stress, fatigue, frustration, and anger at the professional pool industry. She said, \"You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break\".\nAfter leaving the sport, Balukas returned to Bay Ridge. She took over management of her family's pool hall, Hall of Fame Billiards on Ovington Avenue in Brooklyn. She says \"I'm enjoying my life immensely... I have moved on\". In summing up these events in a 1992 article, \"The New York Times\" stated, \"So America's greatest woman pool player competes only for the odd soda. If you're feeling lucky, drop by her poolroom...If you're thirsty...go elsewhere\".\nHonors.\nIn 1975, when she was fifteen years old, Balukas was already described as the \"best female pool player in the world\". Announcers had stopped calling Balukas \"the Little Princess\", but introduced her to audiences as \"the Queen\". By that time she had won the World Straight Pool Championship women's division eight of the last nine years. During those same years, she also won sixteen women's professional tournaments. She had been named the Billiard Congress of America Player of the Year five times. In 1985, Balukas became the second woman (after Dorothy Wise) to enter the BCA Hall of Fame. She was the youngest person ever to receive the honor, at just under 27 years of age. In 1999, Balukas was ranked number fifteen on \"Billiard Digest's\" Fifty Greatest Players of the Century."}

The highway is long. It goes through mostly rural areas, and is usually used as a shortcut from U.S. Route 9 (US 9) to New York State Route 9G. The road passes several landmarks along its path. The road began its history in about 1685, when a group of Native Americans built the Sepasco Trail. This trail went from the Hudson River to Lake Sepasco, and followed the same path that currently exists as Route 308. The trail was there until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was built over it. Route\u00a0308 was officially formed in 1930.\nRoute description.\nPart of NY\u00a0308 is in the Rhinebeck Village Historic District, which is a area that has 272 historical buildings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. A well-known attraction is the Beekman Arms Inn, which is located at the corner of NY\u00a0308 and US\u00a09. The inn was started in 1776, and says it is one of the oldest inns within the United States.\nThe road begins at US\u00a09 in the village of Rhinebeck, which is above sea level. To the south of here is a park, a small lake, and a cemetery. At this point, the Dutchess County Fairgrounds are north of Route\u00a0308. The highway goes to the east, and is called East Market Street. It soon leaves Rhinebeck, while it runs next to a small creek sometimes known as the Landsman Kill.\nThe road intersects with County Route\u00a0101 and then turns to the north. It also intersects with Route\u00a09G before it turns to the east into a rural area. In this area, Route\u00a0308 carries about 6,400 vehicles each day. There are many small lakes around the road as it intersects with County Route\u00a052 and turns to the northeast. NY\u00a0308 then travels west of Sepasco Lake before turning east again. It ends at NY\u00a0199 in the town of Milan.\nHistory.\nThe earliest people that lived in northern Dutchess County were the Mohicans. They were a Native American nation that came to the area about 3,000\u00a0years ago. There were around 8,000 Mohicans during the time they first saw the Europeans. However, there were only 800 after the American Revolution. Artifacts were found along the shore of Lake Sepasco, which is a small lake near NY 308. The artifacts included very old arrowheads, and are now being shown at a local museum. \nA smaller group of these Native Americans were known as the Sepasco Indians. This name was used for Native Americans in the Sepasco area, which is now known as Rhinebeck. The word \"Sepasco\" probably came from the tribe's word for \"little river\" or \"stream\", which is \"sepuus\". After the Civil War, only a few of the Sepasco were left. The last Sepasco Indian died in 1867 in a hut near Lake Sepasco. By 1685, a trail known as the Sepasco Trail was formed by the Sepasco people. This trail started at the Hudson River and went east through the village of Rhinebeck. It ended at Lake Sepasco. Part of the trail from Rhinebeck to Lake Sepasco follows about the same path that is today taken by Route\u00a0308.\nThe trail was there until 1802, when a turnpike, a type of road, was built over it \"for improving and making a road from the west line of the Town of Salisbury in the State of Connecticut to the Susquehannah River at or near the Town of Jericho\". The part of the new turnpike east of the Hudson River was sometimes known as the \"Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike\". A plaque was placed in November 1922 at the Beekman Arms Inn. The sign marked the crossing of the Kings Highway (now called US\u00a09) and the Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike.\nNY\u00a0308 itself was officially made during 1930. The path of the road was changed a bit in the 1960s."}

Located at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, it is the largest train station in the world by number of platforms.\nHistory.\nThe first station at this site was built in 1871 by the New York Central Railroad at a time when there were many long-distance passenger trains in the United States which most people took to move across the country. Back then it was called \"Grand Central Depot\". In 1913 the station was rebuilt and given its current name, \"Grand Central Terminal\", but today many people call it \"Grand Central Station\". In fact, \"Grand Central Station\" is the name of the nearby post office, and of a New York City Subway station underneath.\nLayout.\nGrand Central Station covers an area of 48\u00a0acres and has 44 platforms on two levels, with 67 tracks along them. There are 41 tracks on the upper level and 26 tracks on the lower level. All of them are built underground at the end of a long tunnel under Park Avenue, where trains have to change from diesel to electric power using a third rail to avoid problems with exhaust. These platforms serve commuters traveling on the Metro-North Railroad to Westchester County, New York, Putnam County, New York, and Dutchess County, New York in New York State, and Fairfield County, Connecticut and New Haven County, Connecticut in the state of Connecticut.

But soon those groups disappeared and very few people came to live here because it is a very dry region.\nWhen the French colony of \"Saint-Domingue\" (present Haiti) was created, the Pedernales river was the southern border between that colony and the Spanish colony of \"Santo Domingo\" (present Dominican Republic). During those colonial times, some soldiers came here for some time but almost nobody lived here for a long time.\nIn 1927, the Dominican government brought farmers from other places of the country and made a town for them; the new town was given the name of Pedernales and its first administrator was S\u00f3crates Nolasco who later became a well-known writer.\nThe town became, in 1938, a municipal district (an administrative division of a municipality in the Dominican Republic) of Enriquillo, province of Barahona.\nWhen the Pedernales province was created in 1957, the town of Pedernales became the capital of the new province.\nPopulation.\nThe municipality had, in , a total population of 14,590: 7,473 men and 7,117 women. The urban population was of the total population.\nGeography.\nThe only rivers in the municipality, and in the province, are the Pedernales river and its tributary Mulito.\nSierra de Bahoruco (\"Bahoruco mountain range\") is in the northern half of the municipality; its highest mountain, and the highest mountain of the province, is \"Loma del Toro\", above sea level, in the limits with the Independencia province.\nThe municipality has a total area of and has only one municipal district (a subdivision of a municipality): Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez.\nThe altitude of the city of Pedernales is above sea level.\nThe municipality of Pedernales has the Independencia Province to the north, the Barahona Province to the east, the municipality of Oviedo to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the south and Haiti to the west. The city is at about from the border with Haiti.\nClimate.\nPedernales has a subtropical steppe/low-latitude semi-arid hot climate (K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification: BSh).\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is . The month with the most precipitation on average is September with of rainfall, followed by October with .\nThe driest season is winter. The month with the least rainfall on average is January with an average of followed by February with an average of .\nPedernales is in a hot region; the average temperature for the year is . The warmest month, on average, is August with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of .\nAdministrative division.\nThe municipality of Pedernales has only one municipal district:\nEconomy.\nBecause Pedernales is on the border, the trade with Haiti is important. But the main economic activity is farming, mainly on the mountains, where coffee and beans are important products. Potato, cabbage and other vegetables are produced in the Sierra de Bahoruco.\nFishing is also an important activity in the province, mainly close to the Beata Island, where lobster, conch and several kind of fishes are caught.\nTourism is becoming an important economic activity because there are several beautiful beaches with white sand, like \"Cabo Rojo\" and \"Bah\u00eda de las \u00c1guilas\". There are two of the largest national parks of the country: the \"Jaragua National Park\" and the \"Sierra de Bahoruco National Park\".\nMining of limestone to send to other countries and for a cement factory is another important economic activity in the municipality."}

It is called the Flynn effect. The rise in most industrialized countries where IQ testing has long been commonplace is about three IQ points per decade. James R. Flynn described this phenomenon in 1984.\nOthers supported the claims. They found the rise was mostly due to the test scores of those who scored an IQ below 100. The number of those who were classified as \"mentally handicapped\" reduced from year to year. In contrast, the scores of those who got more than 100 did not seem to be affected.\nThe rise.\nIQ tests are re-normalized every so often to hold the average score for an age group at 100. This gave a first hint to Flynn that the IQ was changing over time. The revised versions are standardized on new samples and scored with respect to those samples only. The only way to compare the difficulty of two versions is to have a group of people take both tests. This confirms IQ gains over time.\nThe average rate of rise seems to be around three IQ points per decade. Today, children go to school for a longer time. They have also become more familiar with testing. It might therefore be expected that the biggest gains occur with school-related content, such as vocabulary, arithmetic or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have had small gains and occasional declines over the years. The largest changes appear on general intelligence factor loaded (g-loaded) tests such as Raven's Progressive Matrices, instead. For example, Dutch soldiers gained 21 points in only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.\nSome studies focused on the distribution of scores have found that the Flynn effect mainly occurs with lower scores. However, Raven (2000) found that a lot of data must be re-interpreted with respect to the date of birth. Previously, this data had been interpreted to show that many abilities decrease when people get older. This data must now be interpreted to show that many abilities had in fact increased dramatically, as Flynn predicted. On many tests this occurs at all levels of ability. Two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that \nSome scientists believe these changes are very big. One of them is Ulric Neisser. In 1995 he was the head of a task force of the American Psychological Association, charged with writing a statement on where intelligence research was. He estimates that if American children of 1932 could take an IQ test normed in 1997 their average IQ would have been only about 80. In other words, half of the children in 1932 would be classified as having borderline mental retardation or worse in 1997. Looking at Ravens, Neisser estimates that if you extrapolate beyond the data, which shows a 21 point gain between 1952 and 1982, an even larger gain of 35 IQ points can be argued. Arthur Jensen warns that extrapolating beyond the data leads to results such as an IQ of minus 1000 for Aristotle (even assuming he would have scored 200 in his day).\nMost of the time, the effect is associated with IQ rises. A similar effect has been found with increases in semantic and episodic memory."}

{"id": "208418", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208418", "title": "Billy Graham", "text": "William Franklin Graham, Jr. (November 7, 1918 \u2013 February 21, 2018), better known as Billy Graham, was an American Evangelical Christian minister and evangelist. He was a member of the Southern Baptist Convention. Graham is widely recognized as the one of the most important and most influential preachers of the twentieth century. He was a spiritual advisor to several U.S. presidents. Graham preached in person to more people than anyone else who has ever lived. Until 2002, Graham's lifetime audience with radio and television broadcast was more than two billion people. Graham met every United States President since Harry S. Truman. He received many honors including the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nGraham was born on a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. His mother and father Morrow Coffey and William Franklin Graham managed the farm. They were devout Christians and Graham's mother had a big influence on his faith. In 1933 Graham's father forced Graham and his sister Catherine to drink beer until they vomited. This made them hate alcohol for the rest of their lives. The Billy Graham Center says Graham was converted in 1934 during a revival meeting in Charlotte led by local evangelist Mordecai Ham. However, he did not become a member of a local youth group because he was \"too worldly\". After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936 Graham went to Bob Jones College (now called Bob Jones University).\nIn his first year of college, he found both the schoolwork and rules too hard. As a result, he almost had to leave school, but Bob Jones, Sr., the founder of the college, said that in doing that, he would throw his life away. He told Graham, \"At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily.\"\nWhile he was at college, Graham would often take a canoe to a little island in the river. On that island he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. In 1937, Graham transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College of Florida) where the Florida College in Temple Terrace, Florida now stands. Graham later transferred to Wheaton College and in 1943, graduated from Wheaton in Illinois with a degree in anthropology. While he was at Wheaton College, Graham decided to take the Bible as the perfect Word of God. He accepted this as truth at the Forest Home Christian camp (now called \"Forest Home Ministries\"), southeast of the Big Bear area in Southern California. A memorial is there showing where Graham first made this choice.\nFamily.\nIn 1946, Graham married a girl who was in a class with him, Ruth Bell. Her parents were Presbyterian missionaries in China. Her father, L. Nelson Bell, worked as a surgeon there. When talking about Bell, Graham said \"She looked at me and our eyes met and I felt that she was definitely the woman I wanted to marry.\" Ruth said that he wanted to please God more than any man she had ever met. They married two months after they graduated from college. After marriage, they lived in a log cabin that she had made. Ruth died on June 14, 2007, at age 87. They had five children together: Virginia (Gigi) Graham Foreman; Anne Graham Lotz; Ruth Dienert; Franklin Graham, and Ned Graham. They also have 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.\nMinistry.\nBeginning.\nGraham became a Southern Baptist minister in 1939. Then he took over and organized financing of the radio program \"Songs in the Night\". Afterwards, he made the baritone, George Beverly Shea director of music in his ministry. The program went well, but Graham left it in 1945. He wished to be a chaplain in the armed forces, but after trying to get in, he came down with mumps, so he had to not enlist. After some time, he recovered in Florida. Then he started Youth for Christ with evangelist Charles Templeton. He traveled all through the United States and Europe as an evangelist.\nHearst intervention.\nGraham held many revival meetings in Los Angeles in 1949. These revivals are thought to be the time when Graham became a national religious figure. This is because he got help from the powerful newspaper man William Randolph Hearst. Many people believe that Hearst liked Graham for his love of his country. It is also believed that he may have thought that Graham could help with his conservative, anti-communist views. Hearst sent a telegram to his newspaper editors reading \"Puff Graham\" during Graham's late 1949 Los Angeles crusade. Therefore, one could read much more about Graham now in Hearst's newspaper chain and national magazines. That meant that his crusade event could run for eight full weeks\u00a0\u2014 five weeks longer than planned. Henry Luce put Graham on the cover of \"Time magazine\" in 1954.\nMiddle years.\nGraham had missions in both London and the Madison Square Garden in 1957. The London mission lasted 12 weeks and the New York mission was about 16 weeks. He also led his first crusade in Australia in 1959.\nGraham was the president of Northwestern College in Minnesota from 1948 to 1952. He began many organizations, such as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He also spoke against racial segregation during the 1960s. Graham did not want to speak to segregated auditoriums. He even once tore down ropes that had been put up to split the audience. Graham paid bail money to get Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. out of jail. That was during the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement. He asked King to join him in the pulpit at the revival meeting at New York City in 1957. During that 16-week tour, he was heard by many people, who came to hear him at Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium and the Times Square. Because they became good friends, Graham was one of the few white people King let call him by his birth name \"Michael\".\nLater years.\nDuring the Cold War, Graham was the first evangelist to speak behind the Iron Curtain. During the Apartheid times, Graham would not go to South Africa until the government let all people sit together. He finally preached his first crusade there in 1973, during which he taught that apartheid was not right.\nGraham went to China, where his wife Ruth was born. He also appeared in North Korea in 1992. On September 14, 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks, Graham led prayer at the Washington National Cathedral. President George W. Bush went to this service. On June 24, 2005, he began what he said would be his last North American crusade. On the weekend of March 11 and March 12, 2006 Graham held the \"Festival of Hope\". It was held in New Orleans, which was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.\nGraham said that he had to retire because of his failing health. He had had Parkinson's disease for about 15 years, as well as many other problems. In August 2005, though weak, he used a walker to go to at the start of his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. On August 18, 2007, Graham, aged 88, was treated for intestinal bleeding.\nGraham preached Christianity to nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories. He also preached to hundreds of millions more through television, videos, movie, and webcasts. He went to over 41 evangelistic crusades. He began this ministry in 1947, and kept doing it until recently. He would often use a big area, such as a stadium, park, or a large street to speak at. Groups of up to 5,000 people would often sing in choir at his meetings. Graham would preach the gospel and then invite people to come forward. In 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 in his Moscow audience came for salvation upon his request.\nGraham died on February 21, 2018, at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, at the age of 99, just 259 days shy of his 100th birthday.\nPolitics.\nIn politics, Graham was a member of the Democratic Party, but changed to Republican during the presidency of his friend Richard Nixon. Though he did not support people running on politics in general, he gave his support in some cases over the years.\nPastor to Presidents.\nGraham met every United States President since Harry Truman. He became close friends with Vice-President Richard Nixon while on a golf course. Dwight D. Eisenhower asked to see Graham while on his deathbed. Graham also worked with Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, the Bush family, and Barack Obama when he visited Rev. Graham at his home in Montreat, North Carolina where they \u201chad a private prayer.\u201d\nGraham played golf with John F. Kennedy, even though Kennedy was a Roman Catholic. Graham spent the last night of Johnson's presidency in the White House. He was also there for the first night of Nixon's. Nixon appeared at one of Graham's revivals in East Tennessee in 1970. It had one of the biggest crowds ever to gather in Tennessee. However, their friendship got weaker because Graham did not approve of Nixon's post-Watergate behavior. They became better friends again. Graham said at that time, \"I'm out of politics.\"\nWhen Graham went to the hospital in 1976, three Presidents called in one day to wish him well: former President Nixon, President Ford, and President-Elect Carter. He was at the start of Reagan's presidency, and gave the speech at George H.W. Bush's presidency. Bill Clinton went to one of Graham's New York revivals in 2005. He also said that he had gone to Graham's revival as a boy in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.\nGraham spoke at many funerals over the years, but he was unable to do Reagan's on June 11, 2004, because of recent hip surgery. Graham had been Reagan's first choice. Bad health also kept Graham from doing the funeral of President Gerald R. Ford in Washington D.C., on January 2, 2007.\nForeign policy views.\nGraham spoke against communism. He was in favor of the U.S. Cold War policy, including the Vietnam War. However, in a 1999 speech, he talked about his relationship with the late North Korean dictator Kim Il-Sung. He said that he was a \"different kind of communist\" and \"one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the Japanese.\" Graham went on to say that even though he had never met Kim's son and former North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, he had \"exchanged gifts with him.\" Graham gave a globe covered with doves to the \"North Korean Friendship Museum\".\nControversy.\nAgreement with Richard Nixon's antisemitism.\nIn 1994, the people read in the diaries of H. R. Haldeman that Graham had talked with President Nixon about \"Jewish domination of the media\". (H. R. Haldeman worked with Richard Nixon at the White House). Because what Haldeman had written was different from things that Graham usually said in public, most Jewish groups did not really believe it. Graham released a statement that he never spoke \"publicly or privately about the Jewish people, including conversations with President Nixon, except in the most positive terms.\" He said, \"Those are not my words.\" In 2002, however, \"Richard Nixon tapes\" showed that Graham had talked about it, in the 1970s. This was like Haldeman had written. On the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that Jews had control over the American media. He called it a \"stranglehold\" in 1972. Graham said \"This stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going down the drain.\" When the videotapes were released, Graham said he was sorry for his remarks, saying, \"although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made ... They do not reflect my views, and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks.\" He also said that \"If it wasn't on tape, I would not have believed it. I guess I was trying to please... I went to a meeting with Jewish leaders and I told them I would crawl to them to ask their forgiveness.\"\nIdeas about women.\nIn 1970, Graham said feminism was part of a society with fewer rules and that women did not want to compete with men. He also said that a women should be a wife, mother, and homemaker. This idea of the role of women was published in the \"Ladies' Home Journal\". Many people sent letters of protest. The magazine added a section called \"The New Feminism\" after a sit-in protest at the \"Journal\".\nGraham was never alone with any woman except his wife. This was called the Billy Graham rule.\nBilly's daughter Bunny said that her father did not allow her and her sisters higher education.\nAwards and honors.\nRecognition.\nBetween 1950 and 1990, Graham appeared many times on \"Gallup's list of most admired people\". The United States Postal Service has said that he is one of the few Americans, along with the current President, who can get mail that simply says his name and country: \"Billy Graham, America\". He received the \"Congressional Gold Medal\" from the United States Congress and the \"Presidential Medal of Freedom\" from Reagan, America's highest civilian honors. President Bill Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole gave Graham the \"Congressional Gold Medal\" at a ceremony in Washington D.C., in 1996. The George Washington Carver Memorial Institute has honoured his work to help make better relationships between people of different races.\nNational day.\nIn 1971, Graham's hometown of \"Charlotte\" held a \"Billy Graham Day\", to which President Richard Nixon came. On May 30, 1999, Graham was invited to speak right before the Indianapolis 500. On May 31, 2007, the $27 million \"Billy Graham Library\" was officially started in Charlotte. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton came. In 1990, the band \"The Swirling Eddies\" gave homage to Graham with its song \"Billy Graham\" on the album \"Outdoor Elvis\".\nAwards.\nGraham got the \"Big Brother of the Year Award\" for his work on behalf of children. He also got the \"Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion\" and the \"Sylvanus Thayer Award\" for his commitment to \"Duty, Honor, and Country.\" The \"Billy Graham Children's Health Center\" in Asheville is named after him. There is a special chair named after him at the Southern Baptist Samford University; the \"Billy Graham Chair of Evangelism and Church Growth.\""}

{"id": "208425", "revid": "7865638", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208425", "title": "Straight pool", "text": "Straight pool, also called 14.1 continuous or simply 14.1, is a pocket billiards (pool) game. It was the common sport of championship competition until faster-playing games like nine-ball and to a lesser extent eight-ball became more popular. This is the game from the history of pool.\nThe game was especially popular in the United States, and was the subject of the classic 1961 film \"The Hustler\".\nIn straight pool, the person shooting may attempt to pocket any ball on the table. The aim of the game is to reach a set number of points. The amount of points needed to win is agreed to before the game. One point is scored for each ball pocketed legally (that is, without a foul). A typical game might require a player to score 100 points. This means that at least 100 balls must be pocketed to win. In professional competition, straight pool is usually played to 150 points. Straight pool is a call-pocket game. This means that the player must call what pocket they mean to sink the ball into on every shot. It does not matter how balls reach the pocket (Hole) . As long as no foul is involved, and the balls goes into the pocket that is called, a point is scored. \nStraight pool is well known in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Philippines, but the game has become more elsewhere. Probably the all-time greatest player (by professional statistics), Willie Mosconi, held the record high run, of 526 balls, which stood for 65 years until beaten by John Schmidt, who scored 626 points in a 2019 attempt to break Mosconi's record.\nRules.\nThe first rack.\nIn the first rack in straight pool (when you place all the balls together before the break), the fifteen object balls (the colored balls) are racked in a triangular frame, usually made from aluminum, wood, or plastic. The center of the ball at the top of the rack is placed over the a spot on the table called the foot spot. Traditionally, the 1 ball is placed at the rack's right corner, and the 5 ball is placed at the rack's left corner. Other balls are placed randomly. All the balls must touch their neighbors. However, it is considered a courtesy by some players to place a striped ball at the front of the rack. This is because the break is very important and it is believed that a striped ball is easier to hit very precisely.\nIn most pool games, pocketing a ball and spreading the balls is the aim on the break. Straight pool is different. In it, the goal on the first break shot is to leave the opponent with a \"safety\". A safety means a situation where they opponent has no good shot. The reason for this is because the call-pocket rule\u2014the rule discussed earlier requiring the player to call the ball they intend to pocket\u2014\"includes\" the break shot. For that reason, if you break the balls hard, and even if you pocket many balls, you will not be able to go again unless you called one of those balls in a pocket and it goes into that pocket.\nTo perform a legal break, either a ball must be pocketed in a called pocket or the cue ball and at least two additional colored balls must touch rails. If you do not succeed at one of these two options, the shot is a foul. A foul on the first break results in a special penalty of a loss of 2 points. In addition, the opponent has the choice of either accepting the table as it was left, or of having the balls re-racked and requiring the person who fouled on the break to repeat it. \nAll other fouls during the game have a penalty of a one point deduction. This includes fouling on an \"intragame\" rack (a rack after the first rack, which are discussed later). However, a third foul \"in a row\" at any time in a straight pool game results in a loss of 15 points. When applying this rule, a foul on the initial break, though it is a loss of two points, is not counted as two fouls. The 15 point deduction is in addition to the one point loss for each foul. Thus, the first two fouls are a loss of one point each, and the third foul in a row is a loss of 16 points: 1 point for the foul, and 15 points for it being the third foul in a row.\nIntragame racking.\n\"Intragame racks\" refers to all racks after the first rack. As noted previously, straight pool is played to a specific number of points, normally far more than the 15 total points that can be made in the first rack. For this reason, multiple intragame racks are necessary. Intragame racking employs a separate set of rules from those in place at the game's start on the first rack.\nTo reach the point in time when an intragame rack is needed, the balls are played until only the cue ball and only one object ball remain on the table's surface. At that time, if neither the cue ball or the fifteenth object ball remains in the rack area (or is interfering with racking in the rack area) the fourteen pocketed object balls are racked with no ball placed at the top of the rack, and the rack is placed so that \"if the top ball were in the rack\", its center would be placed over the table's foot spot. Play then continues with the cue ball shot from where it rested, and the fifteenth, non-racked object ball from where it rested prior to racking. \nThe name \"14.1 continuous\" is named after this racking method. That is, that fourteen (14) racked object balls and one (.1) separate colored ball are left at the end of each intragame rack. The shooter will then normally try to pocket the unracked fifteenth colored ball, and at the same time have the cue ball smash into the fourteen racked balls, spreading them so that later shots are available, and the player continue at the table.\nA number of rules detail what must be done when one or both of the cue ball and fifteenth object ball are either in the rack area at the time an intragame rack is neeeded, or are so close to the intragame racking area, that the racking of the 14 balls cannot be done without moving one of them. The rules also vary depending on whether the cue ball or fifteenth object ball are resting on the table's head spot. These rules are shown on the following chart. Note that in the chart the use of the word kitchen refers to the area behind the table's head string."}

It is the common factor in intelligence tests. It is the result of measuring intelligence in different ways.\nCharles Spearman, an early statistician and psychologist, found that school children's grades across unrelated subjects were strongly related to each other. That is to say, children who were good at one area (such as reading) were also good in another area (such as math). He then proposed that these relationships reflected the influence of a dominant factor, which he called \"g\" for \"general\" intelligence. He developed a model where all variation in intelligence test scores can be explained by two factors. The first is the factor specific to an individual mental task: the individual abilities that would make a person more skilled at one cognitive task than another. The second is \"g\", a general factor that governs performance on all cognitive tasks.\nAfter 120 years of cognitive testing, \"g\"s central role is still a meaningful measure. Other models have also been proposed, and there is significant [[controversy] about \"g\" and its alternatives.\nReferences.\n[[Category:Intelligence]]"}

His mother had been taking the drug thalidomide during the pregnancy and this resulted in Thomas being born with physical handicaps. He has flipper-like hands and no arms, and he has very short legs.\nQuasthoff wanted to study music at the conservatory, but he was not allowed to do so because there was a rule that every music student had to play the piano. It was impossible for Quasthoff to play an instrument because of his disability.\nQuasthoff decided to study singing privately. After he had graduated from school he went to university to study law. He did not enjoy the subject, and after studying for three years he chose music as a career. At first he worked as a radio announcer. He got some experience in singing oratorio. Then, in 1988, he won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich. Many people, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, were very impressed with his singing. He became known as a Lieder singer. He first sang in America in 1995. He won many awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance in 2000. It was for his performance together with the mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter of Mahler\u2019s Des Knaben Wunderhorn. They were accompanied by the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Claudio Abbado. He won prizes for his singing of songs by Schubert, Brahms and Liszt, and Bach Cantatas. \nQuasthoff teaches singing at the Hanns Eisler School of Music in Berlin. He is \"artist in residence\" at the Barbican Hall, London. A series called \"Die Stimme\" (The Voice) was made to celebrate his 50th birthday.

Others, which breed in common but less nutritious places (such as leaves), may only lay one egg each day.\nThe eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the front end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on vegetable matter but on the yeasts and microorganisms present on the decaying surface of leaves or fruits. Development time varies widely between species (between seven and more than 60 days) and depends on factors such as temperature, breeding substrate, and crowding.\nRelated genera.\n\"Drosophila\" has a number of close relatives, and some may actually be within its genus."}

Three main networks exist; the largest, called the \"grand r\u00e9seau sud\" (\"large south network\"), lies under the Ve, VIe, XIVe and XVe arrondissements, a second under the XIIIe arrondissement, and a third under the XVIe, though other minor networks are found under the XIIe, XIVe and XVIe for instance. Together, the mines and galleries run for about 280 kilometres.\nExploring the mines is not allowed by the prefecture and people caught get heavy fines. A limited part of the network (1.7\u00a0km) was used as an underground ossuary (storage place for human bones) in the past known as the catacombs of Paris, and can be legally visited from the entrance on Place Denfert-Rochereau. The entire network is commonly but mistakenly called \"the catacombs\". Despite restrictions, the network is often toured by urban explorers popularly called cataphiles.\nOssuary.\nDuring the 18th century, the growing population of Paris resulted in the filling up of existing cemeteries, raising public health concerns. Towards the end of the 18th century, it was decided to create three new large cemeteries and to condemn the existing cemeteries within the city limits. Human remains were slowly moved to a rebuilt section of the abandoned mines that would later become a ossuary. The entrance is located on present day \"Place Denfert-Rochereau\".\nThe ossuary became a tourist attraction on from the early 19th century and has been open to the public on a regular basis from 1867. Although it is officially called the \"Ossuaire Municipal\", it is widely known as \"the catacombs\". Though the entire network of Paris' mines is not a burial place as such, the term 'Catacombs' is commonly used to refer to the whole network."}

{"id": "209100", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209100", "title": "I've Got a Secret", "text": "I've Got a Secret was a weekly game show produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman for CBS television. It was a \"panel\" game show, which means that it had, in addition to a host and guests, a group of people who together acted as judges. The show was created by comedy writers Allan Sherman and Howard Merrill. It was related to Goodson-Todman's other panel show, \"What's My Line?\". The first episode of the show aired on June 19, 1952 and ran until April 3, 1967. The first version of the show was in black and white. It switched to color in 1966.\nThe show was canceled in 1967 and then brought back for the 1972-1973 season and again from June 15 to July 6, 1976, for a summer run. Another production ran on the Oxygen cable channel in a daily version, airing from 2000 through 2003. GSN ran a revival from April 17 to June 9, 2006 with an all-gay panel. In October 2006, GSN decided not to renew the show for a second season, although reruns remained on its schedule for some time afterward.\nHosts and panelists.\nThe show was first hosted by radio and television personality Garry Moore. After several months of an panel that kept changing, the show settled down to include game show host Bill Cullen, comedian Henry Morgan, TV hostess Faye Emerson, and actress Jayne Meadows. In 1958, Emerson left the show to star in a play and was replaced by actress Betsy Palmer. The following year, Meadows moved to the West Coast to live with her husband Steve Allen and was replaced by former Miss America Bess Myerson. Sometimes, guest hosts substituted for Moore, including panelists Morgan and Palmer. Also, other comedians and celebrities guested for the panel when they were away.\nGarry Moore left the show after the 1963-64 season, after his comedy program \"The Garry Moore Show\" was canceled, and he decided to retire from television to travel around the world with his wife. Moore was replaced by Steve Allen on September 21, 1964. Allen also hosted the show during the 1972-1973 revival. Former panelist Bill Cullen hosted the show for its short 1976 CBS summer run. The panelists on this revival were Richard Dawson, Henry Morgan, New York-based entertainment critic Pat Collins, and Elaine Joyce.\nThe Oxygen channel version of the show was hosted by Stephanie Miller until August 2001. Panelists in the Oxygen version included Jim J. Bullock, Jason Kravits, Amy Yasbeck, and Teri Garr. The GSN version was hosted by Bil Dwyer; the panelists were Billy Bean, Frank DeCaro, Jermaine Taylor, and Suzanne Westenhoefer.\nOriginal series.\nGame play.\nEach episode usually had two contestants. After that, a celebrity guest played. Once in a while, if there was extra time, the celebrity was followed by a third regular guest.\nStandard rounds.\nEach round was a guessing game. The panel tried to figure out the contestants' \"secrets\". The idea of a \"secret\" on the show was very broad. Secrets were always intended to be unusual, amazing, embarrassing or humorous. They often were about what happened to a person, owning something, or a job, hobby, success or skill.\nOne or more contestants would walk on. The host would tell the name the contestant or ask their name and where they were from. He would then ask them to \"whisper your secret to me, and we'll show it to the folks at home.\" The contestant would then whisper their secret to the host, while the audience and television viewers were shown the secret by writing printed on the television screen. Then the host would give the panel a clue. For example, \"the secret concerns something that happened to [Contestant's Name].\" The host would then choose a panelist to begin asking questions.\nWhen the show first started, each panelist had 15 seconds of questioning of a guest. Then this would repeat once. Each 15 seconds that passed without the secret being correctly guessed won the contestant $10. However, a guest could not win more than $80. In mid-1954, they changed to only one question period for each panelist. They changed the money to $20 so that the top prize would stay at $80. Also, the time limit for questions was no longer exact. Instead, a buzzer went off to end the questioning, and production staff decided when to use the buzzer. This was partly because the program was shown live (not taped), and this sometimes required the show to be longer or shorter to keep the show running on time. In later times, the panelists were sometimes buzzed when they were too close to the secret, or at a point that would get a laugh.\nFollowing the guest's secret being discovered, the host sometimes asked the contestant more about their secret, or, if it made sense, the contestant demonstrated their secret. These demonstrations sometimes included the host, and sometimes one or more of the panelists.\nA number of famous people appeared with secrets, including Col. Harland Sanders who founded Kentucky Fried Chicken (\"I started my restaurant with my first Social Security check\"), Philo T. Farnsworth (\"I invented electronic television\"), Pete Best (\"I used to be one of THE BEATLES\"), and an elderly man, Samuel Seymour, who was the last surviving eyewitness to Abraham Lincoln's assassination (he was 5 years old at the time).\nGuest rounds.\nOn each usual episode, a celebrity guest came on the show with a secret. The celebrity usually started the episode by coming out from the behind the curtain and saying \"my name is [Name] and I've Got a Secret!\". Sometimes, though, the celebrity would say \"and this is \"I've Got a Secret\"!\". In the beginning, the celebrities would have a secret. The secrets would sometimes be personal secrets, similar to the other contestants. Other times the secret would be about something they were there to do. The guest part of the show often was really a was to show some new technology or product.\nLater in the show, a common thing was for the celebrity to challenge the panel in some other game. This later became the main use of the celebrity part of the show, and they no longer pretended to have a secret. Instead, the celebrity would just come out with a challenge for the panel. Several of these challenges later were the main idea used for other game shows. For example, a game in which Woody Allen challenged the panel to guess words by what children had said they meant, which became the basis for \"Child's Play\". Or two challenges with Peter Falk and Soupy Sales in which the panel had to guess who a celebrity was after being show a photographs of them as a baby and others as the aged, which later was used for the show, \"Face the Music\".\nHistory and style.\n\"I've Got a Secret\" was more informal than its sister show \"What's My Line?\". The panel and host used each other's first names. As noted, the time limit on questioning was removed early in the show', and time limits were set more for entertainment. The men on the panel always wore normal suits or even sport jackets, though both Morgan and Moore sometimes chose bow ties over straight ties. Until the later years of the series, both Moore, and members of the panel smoked cigarettes on the air. The panel was introduced at the start of each episode by the host, usually with a pun on their names.\nOnly yes-or-no questions were supposed to be asked by the panel, but this was often relaxed. Unlike on \"What's My Line?\", the host offered hints and suggestions when the panel was quite lost, or when an answer might make them lost. Like on \"What's My Line?\", the panelists were not allowed to try to figure out secrets together, but later in the series, no one bothered the panelists when they whispered ideas to each other.\nThe series began in black-and-white, and only in 1966 switched to color. When the show is seen in reruns, though even episodes which were in color are in black and white, as they did not \"record\" the color. Much of the series had a commercial sponsor. The opening of the show would have an advertisement for that company. Signs on the set also promoted the products, and on commercial breaks the product would be advertised. Some sponsors provided samples of their products, which were given to each contestant. Late in the series, sponsorship was stopped.\nAn Australian version of the show was produced and aired in Brisbane on QTQ Channel 9 from 1967 until 1973. It was hosted by Newsreader Don Secombe. Similar to the American version, it had regular celebrity panelists including Ron Cadee, Babette Stevens and Joy Chambers.\nChanges in the revivals.\n1970s revivals.\nThe format of the 1970s revivals were very similar to the original series. However celebrity secrets were back, as opposed to challenges.\nOxygen revival.\nOn the Oxygen revival, the contestant earned $200, and if no one on the panel guessed, they earned a $1,000 prize. Stephanie Miller hosted this version. The show's set was made to look like a fancy city apartment.\nGSN revival.\nOn GSN's revival, each panelist had 40 seconds for questioning, with one conference allowed. Stumping the entire panel won the contestant $1,000 and \"dinner for 2 in Beverly Hills.\" The fine print at the end of the show disclosed that contestants were also paid an appearance fee. Losing contestants also received some unspecified parting gifts. Several minor show business professionals demonstrated their performances on the show, including piano juggler Dan Menendez. Another element in the revival was that all the panelists were openly gay. This was played upon as host, Bill Dwyer, was introduced as \"the straight man to the panel\".\nEpisode status.\nAs with \"What's My Line?\", early episodes from the original series' first season in 1952 appear to have been lost. From late 1952 until the 1967 cancellation, most episodes appear to exist as a digital transfer of the original black-and-white kinescope movies.\nGSN concluded its most recent airing of \"I've Got A Secret\"'s run on July 13, 2008 at 3:30 AM (ET), paired with \"What's My Line?\" at 3:00. However, they began their run in mid-2007 with episodes from late 1961 or early 1962. A good portion of the series is unlikely to be aired, due to the show's longtime sponsorship by Winston cigarettes, which remains an existing brand. It is unclear whether this is mandated legally, or simply a choice by GSN. In addition, the network skipped several episodes through its run which are known to have been skipped in previous runs of the show; this may mean that other episodes are lost or in bad enough condition for GSN not to air them.\nAll subsequent revivals of \"Secret\" exist in their entirety. GSN has occasionally aired single episodes from the 1972-1973 season, the latest being an episode featuring Bob Barker as the celebrity guest, to commemorate his retirement from \"The Price Is Right\" in mid-2007. GSN also occasionally adds reruns of its 2006 revival to the regular schedule.\nTheme music.\nThe first theme music used on the show from 1952-1961 was \"Plink, Plank, Plunk!\" by Leroy Anderson (this theme can be heard on the album \"Classic TV Game Show Themes\". However, the theme on the CD was credited to Norman Paris).\nThe second theme, used from 1961-1962, was an upbeat arrangement of the \"Theme to \"A Summer Place\"\" by Max Steiner.\nThe third theme was used from 1962-1967. It was an upbeat, spritely march featuring piccolo and xylophone, composed by the show's musical director Norman Paris and played by a live studio combo. It quoted a familiar melody widely associated with schoolyard taunts, to which the words \"I've got a secret!\" might be sung by children in a teasing manner.\nIn addition to being used as a tag for his entrance on CBS episodes he hosted, Steve Allen's composition \"This Could Be the Start of Something\" was used as the opening theme in 1972. The closing theme to the 1972 version was written by Edd Kalehoff. The theme from the 1976 version with Bill Cullen was used one year later on the ABC game show \"Second Chance\". A remix of that theme was also used in the Australian version of \"Family Feud\".\nTim Mosher and Stoker are credited with the 2000 theme, while Alan Ett and Scott Liggett contributed an up jazz theme for Bil Dwyer's 2006 version of the show for GSN."}

The modern Carrow Road site has a club superstore, catering facilities and a Holiday Inn hotel.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nNorwich City F.C. played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908. The record attendance at this time was 10,366 in a match against Sheffield Wednesday in a second round FA Cup match in 1908. After a disagreement over the rent of the Newmarket Road ground, Norwich City moved to a new home in 1908 - a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as The Nest.\nBy the 1930s, the ground was not big enough for the growing support. Expansion of The Nest was not possible, and there were safety problems with the existing structures. The club began looking for another ground in 1926. Part of the pitch eventually collapsed. The Football Association were not happy with Norwich City\u2019s efforts to repair The Nest. They eventually wrote to the club on 15 May 1935, saying \" The Nest was no longer suitable for large crowds and measures must be taken\".\nWith the new season just weeks away, Norwich City were very concerned. About half a mile south of The Nest, they found a new site, the home of the Boulton Paul Aircraft Sports Ground in Carrow Road. On 1 June 1935, the club purchased the ground on a 20-year lease, from its owners Colman's.\nInitial construction.\nThe new stadium took its name from the street. However, the name \"Carrow\" originally referred to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside. Construction began quickly. Ten days after buying the site, work began.\nBy 17 August most of the stands and terraces had been completed. Finally, after just 82 days, on 31 August Carrow Road football ground was opened for the Second Division match v West Ham United.\nNorwich won the game 4-3. The attendance was 29,779 \u2013 at the time, a new record crowd for Norwich home games. The first competitive goal at the ground was scored by Norwich's Doug Lochhead.\nAn aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing and a covered stand, with a Colman's Mustard advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air. The club's association with Colman's has continued into the modern era; in 1997 the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with the company. The mustard manufacturer's original factory was next to the stadium in Carrow Road, and the ground was opened by Russell Colman, the President of the club. Inglis describes the early Carrow Road as comprising \"a Main Stand, a covered end terrace and two large open banks\". The covered terrace was paid for by Captain Evelyn Barclay, the vice-president of Norwich City. It was constructed in time for the opening of the 1937-38 season. There is a stand named after Barclay in the modern stadium.\nAt this time, the ground's capacity was 38,000. The new ground received a royal seal of approval: on 29 October 1938, King George VI watched the home game versus Millwall. This was the first time a ruling monarch had watched a Second Division match.\nGround developments.\nFloodlights were erected at the ground in 1956 and the \u00a39,000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. However, Norwich's success in the 1959 FA Cup secured the financial status of the club and provided sufficient funds for a cover to be built over the South Stand. In 1963, the record was set for attendance for Carrow Road: a crowd of 43,984 watched a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City, and the South Stand (now the Jarrold) was covered \"soon after\".\nAfter a disaster at Glasgow Ranger\u2019s Ground, Ibrox in 1971, ground capacities had to be reduced to around 20,000 people. \nA two-tier terrace was built at the River End. Soon afterwards, seats began to replace the terraces. By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675. A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands. The damaged stand was eventually demolished completely. In 1987 it was replaced by a new City Stand. Chairman Robert Chase said that \"Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre \u2013 the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass\".\nConversion to all-seater.\nAfter a disaster at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s ground Hillsborough in 1989 and, afterwards, the outcome of the Taylor Report in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater with the corners being filled. Today, Carrow Road is an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 26,034, with a record attendance for an all-seated crowd of 25,522 for the Premiership match against Manchester United in April 2005.\nThe South Stand was replaced in 2003 when a new 7,000 seat South stand, subsequently renamed the Jarrold Stand was built in its place. The club installed new electronic screen/scoreboards at either end of the stadium in 2007. Behind the goals, they are full colour, with scope for still and moving images. They were first used in the 5-2 Carling Cup victory over Barnet F.C. in August 2007.\nStands.\nThe current stadium consists of five stands; the Barclay (sponsored by Coral (the northeastern stand), the River End known as the Regency Security Stand Stand (the southwestern stand), the Geoffrey Watling City Stand (the northwestern stand), the Jarrold Stand (the southeastern stand) and the most recent addition, the Aviva Community Stand (the southern stand).\nRegency Security Stand.\nThe previous River End stand (named due to it being close to the River Wensum) was demolished in April 1979. A two-tiered replacement, costing \u00a31.7m, was completed in December 1979. Its name was changed to the Norwich &amp; Peterborough Stand in the 1990s due to a sponsorship deal with the Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society.\nThe Barclay.\nThis stand is named after Captain Evelyn Barclay, a former vice-president of the club, who donated the roof costs for the original stand. The Barclay is often incorrectly referred to as the Barclay Stand.\nThe original Barclay was built in 1937 and demolished in 1992, when a new two-tier structure, modelled on the River End (now the Norwich &amp; Peterborough Stand) was built at a cost of \u00a32.8m (offset by a \u00a32m grant from the Football Trust).\nFloodlights are supported on both corners of the Barclay and the Norwich &amp; Peterborough stands, which are the ends behind the goals.\nGeoffrey Watling City Stand.\nThe single-tiered Geoffrey Watling City Stand was built following a severe fire on 25 October 1984. The fire was apparently caused by an employee of the club leaving a three-bar electric fire switched on overnight. The City Stand (as it was named at the time) cost \u00a31.7 million to build and was used for the first time on 30 August 1986 when City hosted Southampton. It was formally opened by the Duchess of Kent on 14 February 1987. The stand was renamed in honour of Norwich City president Geoffrey Watling, who died in 2004.\nThe stand is the smallest of the four in terms of capacity, but includes the Directors' Box, Press Area, and various other hospitality suites.\nThorpe Corner.\nWhere The Barclay extends around to meet the Geoffrey Watling City Stand, is the Thorpe Corner infill, \"affectionately dubbed 'The Snakepit' by supporters\", a term that is even sometimes used in official club reports.\nJarrold Stand.\nThe Jarrold Stand is on the former site of the South Stand, which was named in honour of Sir Arthur South.\nThe Jarrold Stand was partially opened for the game against Sheffield United on 31 January 2004, and fully opened for the next home match against West Ham United on 21 February 2004. This was a landmark for the stadium - it represented the final stand of the original ground to be replaced.\nThe Jarrold Stand is sponsored by Jarrolds, a local department store. The original 4-year sponsorship deal has now been extended through to 2013. The stand is a cantilever, single-tiered, all-seated stand, that can hold up to 8,000 supporters. The Jarrold Stand is \"unusual in having not one, but three separate television gantries suspended beneath its largely perspex roof.\"\nIn 2005, further work was undertaken on the stand and it reopened in 2006. The stand now extends around the Norwich and Peterborough Stand corner of the ground.\nVisiting supporter accommodation.\nAccommodation for visiting supporters is provided in the end of the Jarrold Stand closest to The Barclay. \nAviva Community Stand.\nThe corner infill between the Jarrold and Norwich &amp; Peterborough stands is called the Aviva Community Stand, which was originally built in 2005 and named after sponsors Norwich Union. It seats up to 1,500 fans and also provides extensive facilities for disabled supporters.\nOther facilities and services.\nHoliday Inn Hotel.\nThe club had two options on how to fill the corner between the Barclay and the Jarrold Stand. The club decided not to fill this corner with seats, as this would lead to away supporters being surrounded by home fans.\nIt was therefore decided to complete the ground's corners with a hotel. It was hoped that a hotel could offer greater financial rewards than ticket sales. In 2005, a contract was signed with the Holiday Inn hotel chain in 2005, and construction commenced in 2006. The hotel opened in 2007 and allows customers with pitch-facing rooms to watch matches.\nCatering.\nCatering at Carrow Road is provided by Delia's Canary Catering, which is part of Norwich City Football Club PLC. The service is described: \"All menus are made up from Delia Smith's own published recipes (6,000 in all) and as we are in an agricultural area we take pride in using the finest ingredients and local seasonal produce.\"\nYellows.\nYellows is a \"New York-style diner\" in the Norwich &amp; Peterborough Stand. Earlier restaurants in the same place were called 'Strikers' and 'Scores'.\nDelia's Restaurant and Bar.\nDelia's Restaurant and Bar is a restaurant in the Norwich &amp; Peterborough Stand.\nThe Gunn Club.\nThe Gunn Club is a catering facility behind The Barclay. With access restricted to members and season-ticket holders, \"The Gunn Club\" offers a slightly more up-market catering experience, available for hire on non-match days. The club offers facilities and features including video screens, appearances by current and former club members and (by popular demand) real ale.\nOther merchandising.\nThe 68-page match programme for Norwich City matches costs \u00a33.\nFuture plans for construction.\nThe club have, in the past, stated that they have plans to increase the capacity of the stadium should the club win promotion back to the Premier League, using the increase in funds to finance the expansion. Specifically, these plans include building a second tier on the Jarrold Stand or the Geoffrey Watling City Stand. The club have stated that the Geoffrey Watling stand has foundations designed to support a second tier, and that the roof can be removed and replaced after a second tier is added. At the time the original stand was built the inner ring road ran next to the ground, and any extensions of an upper tier outside the existing footprint of the stand would have caused planning difficulties. Since the road was re-routed in the late 1990s an extension to the stand is less likely to raise planning objections.\nOther uses.\nInternational football.\nCarrow Road has never hosted a match involving the England national football team, but the England national under-21 football team has played at the stadium on three occasions. The first was in 1983 in a UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifying match against Denmark national under-21 football team, which England won 4-1. The team played another qualifying match in the same tournament at the stadium in 1997, beating Greece national under-21 football team 4-2. This game saw Michael Owen's only ever appearance for the England Under-21 side, before his subsequent rise to fame in the senior national team. As part of their preparations for the 2007 finals of the European Championship tournament, the England Under-21s played Slovakia national under-21 football team in a friendly match at the ground in June 2007. England won 5-0 in front of a crowd of 20,193 people.\nGames involving the England Under-19 team and the full England women's national football team have also been played at the stadium. The women's team have played there on two occasions; the first a 1-0 defeat to Nigeria women's national football team in 2002, in front of 8,000 fans, and the second a 1-0 victory over Iceland national women's football team in 2006. The latter game's attendance of 9,616 was the largest crowd that had watched a friendly game involving the women's team.\nMusic.\nThe stadium has also occasionally hosted music concerts. Status Quo played a concert there in 1997. Elton John, supported by Lulu, appeared at the venue in 2005, performing what was at the time the largest concert ever to have been staged in Norwich. George Michael gave a performance there on June 12 2007, supported by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. The John and Michael concerts both attracted crowds of over 20,000 people. Andrew Cullen, the director of sales and marketing for the Carrow Road ground, told BBC Radio Norfolk prior to the George Michael performance that he hoped such concerts would become an annual summer event for the venue, if big enough star names could be attracted."}

She was born in a village in France called Pibrac, which is about ten miles from Toulouse, France. \nLife.\nShe was born with a disfigured hand and a disease called scrofula. When she was a baby, her mother died. Germaine's father married again, but her new stepmother was cruel to Germaine. Germaine's stepmother did not want the other children to contract scrofula, so she talked her husband into keeping Germaine away from the house. When she was very young she started to be a shepherdess. At night she slept in the stable or on vine branches in a roof space. In early ages she learned to practice humility and patience. She was not lonely because she had a gift with a sense of presence of God and other spiritual things. Her daily food was bread and water. She loved Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. She went to church every day. When she heard the church bell ring, she fixed her staff on the ground and left the sheep in the care of Jesus while she was in mass. Even though the flock was near a forest filled with wolves, the sheep were never harmed. After heavy rains or the snow melted, it was hard to cross to go to church. Her only book was the Rosary, and she had great devotion to the Angelus. Several times people saw the water make a passageway for Germaine to cross without wetting her cloths. She helped the poor by sharing her bread with them. One day Germaine's father forbade her wife to treat Germaine cruelly, and gave Germaine a place in the house. Germaine begged to be allowed to keep her humbler way of life. Now, when everyone began to realize Germaine's holiness, she died. She had not awoken at her usual hour one early summer morning of 1601, so her father went to look for her. He found her dead on the vine branches. She was 22 years old. She was buried in front of the stand in the Church of Pibrac."}

It is in the family Pieridae. In seasons with heavy monsoons, this butterfly is seen in large migrations. These migrations are common in Texas. They are less common in the southwest. It sometimes lives in southern Florida.\nDescription.\nThe coloring of the Lyside Sulphur varies. The upper side of the wings is pale yellow. It usually has a black bar on the top edge of the hind wing (the bottom wing). There is normally a bright yellow patch near the base (where the wing connects to the body) of the fore wing (the top wing). Some individuals also have black borders along the top edges of the fore wing. The underside of the wings varies. They vary from a greenish color to bright yellow to almost white. Greener individuals have a whitish vein in the center of the hind wing. The fore wing has a bright yellow basal patch. The wingspan is 1.5 to 2.38 in. (3.8 to 6\u00a0cm.).\nSimilar species.\nSimilar species in the Lyside Sulphur's range include Queen Alexandra's Sulphur (\"Colias alexandra\"), the Cloudless Sulphur (\"Phoebis sennae\"), and the Statira Sulphur (\"Phoebis statira\").\nQueen Alexandra's Sulphur has more yellow on the underside of the fore wing. It has a whitish spot in the center of the hind wing.\nThe Cloudless Sulphur is larger. It is much more yellow.\nThe Statira Sulphur has a more yellowish upper side. The underside of the wings is pale greenish to white. Females have light pinkish markings.\nFlight period.\nThis butterfly is seen almost all year in southern Texas. It is seen from early July to mid November in Arizona. In Florida, there have been scattered sightings from July to October.\nHabitat.\nThe Lyside Sulphur may be found in open, subtropical scrub habitats.\nLife cycle.\nThe caterpillar varies often. It's varies from green to blackish-green. It may have markings or may not have markings. Marked individuals normally have stripes on the top and sides of their bodies. It is the only caterpillar to feed on \"Guaiacum sanctum\". The chrysalis is a bluish-green color. The Lyside Sulphur can grow from egg to adult in as little as 13 days. It has 3 or more broods per year in southern Texas.\nHost plants.\nHere is a list of host plants that the Lyside Sulphur caterpillar eats:"}

The words (libretto) were especially written for the opera by the German poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal.\nIt was first performed in Dresden on 26 January 1911 and was an immediate success. It continues to be a very popular opera in opera houses all over the world and has been performed more often than any other German language 20th century opera.\nThe story is supposed to be happening in Vienna in the time of the Empress Maria Theresa (mid to late 18th century). The music and the words deliberately show the elegant life of aristocratic society of that time. For example: the title of the opera is about the silver rose which traditionally was sent by a bridegroom to his bride and was brought by a knight (the Knight of the Rose).\nThe story of the opera.\nAct 1.\nAct I takes place in the Marschallin\u2019s bedroom. The Marschallin is an aristocratic lady aged 32. She has a lover, a young boy aged 17 called Octavian. When the opera starts, we first hear an orchestral prologue. The music suggests that the Marschallin and Octavian are making love. Then the curtain opens and we see the two together. They hear a noise and the Marschallin thinks her husband is coming, so Octavian hides. It is not her husband, but her cousin Baron Ochs. Ochs is a very rude man with bad manners. He marches in to the Marschallin\u2019s room although the servants had asked him to wait. Octavian manages to change his clothes and appears dressed as a maid called Mariandel. Ochs thinks \u201cshe\u201d is pretty and wants \u201cher\u201d to meet him. Then he tells the Marschallin what he has come for: he wants a young knight to deliver the silver rose to his bride Sophie. He also needs a notary to sign the legal documents of the wedding. Ochs sings about the fun of making love. He wishes he were like Jupiter who was able to disguise himself in many ways.\nThe morning lev\u00e9e begins. This means: the ceremony of the Marschallin getting up. Several people come in. They include: an Italian tenor who sings an aria, two Italian people called Valzacchi and Annina, who are always spreading gossip, and a notary. When the notary tells Ochs that he needs to pay a dowry to his bride, not the other way round, Ochs is very angry.\nWhen the Marschallin is left alone she sings a song about how she is losing her youthful looks. Octavian returns and cheers her up a bit, but she feels sad when he says goodbye very politely and formally, not even kissing her. The Marschallin sends her little black pageboy to run after him with the silver rose.\nAct 2.\nThe story continues in the large room of the house of Herr von Faninal, the father of Sophie whom Ochs wants to marry. Sophie is waiting for the silver rose to arrive (the convention of the time says that her father must not be there). Octavian enters and gives her the rose. The music at this moment is very beautiful and very famous. The people in the room are talking, then Baron Ochs enters rudely. Sophie is shocked about his bad manners. Ochs hums his favourite waltz, then goes to the next room to sign a marriage contract. Sophie sinks into Octavian\u2019s arms. When Ochs comes back, Octavian tells him Sophie does not want him, but Ochs will not listen. Eventually Ochs takes his sword and starts to fight Octavian, who wounds Ochs slightly. Ochs is furious, but calms down a little after he is given some wine.\nOctavian has fallen in love with Sophie, and Sophie with him. He wants to use Valzacchi and Annina to help him with a plan. He writes a note to Ochs, which is supposed to be from the maid Mariandel, asking him to meet her. He gets Annina to take the note to Ochs, who is delighted when he reads it. He sings his favourite waltz.\nAct 3.\nThe scene is an inn near Vienna. Valzacchi and Annina now work both for Octavian and for Ochs. They prefer working for Octavian because he pays them more money. They are planning tricks on Ochs.\nOchs meets Mariandel (Octavian dressed up as the maid again). He tries to get \"her\" drunk, but \"she\" shyly sings \u201cNein, nein! i\u2019 trink kein Wein.\u201d (\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t drink wine\u201d). Ochs thinks \"she\" looks like Octavian. Then strange figures of people appear at a window. Then Annina comes in and says she is Ochs\u2019s wife whom he has deserted. Then some children come in and say that Ochs is their father. Ochs is very embarrassed when Faninal comes in and says Mariandel is his fianc\u00e9e. He tells the people he has never seen Faninal before. Then the Marschallin appears and also the police. The evening is a disaster for Ochs. The Marschallin tells the police it is just a joke. She sends Ochs away.\nThe Marschallin, Sophie and Octavian sing a beautiful trio (using some of the music from the song \u201cNein, nein, i\u2019 trink kein Wein\u201d). Octavian is forgiven. He is left alone with Sophie and they sing a duet together, then go off hand in hand. She has left a handkerchief on the floor. The little black pageboy picks it up and runs after them.\nLanguage.\nThe language used by Hofmannsthal changes according to who is speaking. The members of the nobility speak in very elegant language which is often old-fashioned and always very polite. When good friends speak to one another they often use the familiar (\"du\") (\u201cyou\u201d when used between very close friends). For example: Octavian and the Marschallin often use the familiar \"you\" but sometimes use (\"Sie\") when they are being more formal.\nBaron Ochs is always showing off and the words he uses show this. When Octavian pretends to be the maid Mariandel he speaks in an Austrian dialect. Valzacchi and Annina also speak in a dialect, but their German is not perfect and often mixed with Italian.\nAll this makes it particularly difficult to sing the opera in any other language.\nReferences.\nThe New Kobb\u00e9 Opera book, ed.

He is well known for his skills as a \"slide guitar\" player. He also plays piano, bass and drums.\nLife.\nTaylor was born in Welwyn Garden City. He was raised in Hatfield.\nHe formed his first band \"The Gods\" in 1965. He played together with Ken Hensley (later with Uriah Heep). Other musicians were Greg Lake (later with Emerson, Lake and Palmer) and John Glascock. 1966 he left the band and joined John Mayall\u00b4s Bluesbreakers. He replaced there Peter Green. In June 1969 the Rolling Stones looked for a new guitarist and they found Mick Taylor. His first gig as band member of the Stones was the concert in Hyde Park on 5 July 1969 . The concert was in memory of the late Brian Jones.\nLike Bill Wyman he was never the show man on stage. Due to Richards drug problem he did a lot of guitar work for the albums. Jagger and Taylor recorded \"Sway\", \"Moonlight Mile\", \"Winter\", \"Till the Next Goodbye\" and \"Time Waits For No One\". But Taylor never earned money for this work. As Richards critizied his guitar playing he decided in December 1974 to leave the Stones.\nTaylor's onstage presence with the Rolling Stones is preserved on the album \"Get Yer Ya-Yas Out!\", recorded in New York and Boston in November 1969; in the documentary films \"Stones in the Park\" (released on DVD in 2001), \"Gimme Shelter\" (released in 1970) and \"Cocksucker Blues\" (unreleased); and in the concert film \"\" (shown in cinemas in 1974). Bootleg recordings from the Rolling Stones' tours from 1969 through 1973 also document Taylor's concert performances with the Rolling Stones.\nCompared to the Rolling Stones time his solo career was not very successful. After leaving the Stones he formed together with Jack Bruce, Carla Bley and Bruce Gary the Jack Bruce Band. The project failed due to musical differences between Bruce and Taylor. But despite the split Taylor was often guitar player on solo projects of Rolling Stones members. For example he played om Richards album \"Talk is cheap\" from 1988. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Mick Taylor along with the Rolling Stones in 1989.In the early 1990s he played for Bill Wyman\u00b4s Rhythm Kings.\nDiscography.\nWith The Rolling Stones.\nNon-Rolling Stones work with Rolling Stones members:\nOther session work.\nreleased on CD (A&amp; M - Japan, 2002)\nOriginally released by Alpha Music in 1996, this \"Mick Taylor featuring Sasha\" album should have read \"Sasha featuring Mick Taylor\", but the company felt it would sell better under a household name.

It covers most of the southern part of the state and is transected by the Snake River. The Snake River Plain was formed by magma rising up below the North American Plate. As the plate moved westward, the magma melted rock under the plate. This melting caused the surface to drop and form the Snake River Plain. Underneath the plain is the Snake River Aquifer. The aquifer is fed by the Snake River and its tributaries. Much of the soil in the Snake River Plain is fertile. As a result, today the primary human purpose of the plain is for agriculture."}

He was descended from knights who had participated in the Crusades. One of his ancestors from his father's side of the family had died at the Siege of Antioch.\nJelckama was married to a woman by the name of Fokel, the exact year of their marriage is unknown. She survived for longer than her husband but died in 1553. They had two daughters and a son. Their son was named Janco Douwes Jelckama (1514-1587)and their daughters were named Bonga (1516-1575) and Fokel (1517-1546).\nGrandchildren and great-grandchildren of Jelckama are known.\nA great-granddaughter who died in 1625 probably ended Jelckama's official bloodline.\nRebellion.\nTogether with Pier Gerlofs Donia, Jelckama fought against the Saxon warriors that occupied their homeland of Frisia, at the capture of Medemblik, and in the siege of Middelburg castle.\nJelckama served as Donia's lieutenant for the first five years. After Donia had died in 1520, Jelckama took over the command of the armies. He had been the commander of the Arumer Black Heap and the main leader of the Frisian rebellion against the House of Habsburg since as early as 1519.\nStrength.\nAuthor Wopke Eekhoff described Jelckama as being as sturdy as his giant uncle, who was himself reportedly at least 7 feet tall and once lifted a 1000-pound horse above his head.\nJelckama himself was strong enough to lift a horse over his shoulders high up in the air. His height is documented at 7 feet.\nDeath.\nAfter a series of defeats, he and what was left of the Frisian army were captured in 1523 and taken to the city of Leeuwarden in Frisia. There they were executed. The execution took place in public. It took the executioner four blows to sever Jelckama's head from his extremely thick neck.\nWith the death of Jelckama and the rebels, the independence of Frisia came to an end. It was the last successful revolt in Frisian history and is remembered as such to this day."}

When a person (or animal) is stressed, the body reacts in certain ways - for example, by releasing chemicals called corticosteroids.

It was when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000 to 80,000 gathered at a meeting to demand the reform of parliamentary representation.\nThe end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in a time of famine and chronic unemployment. This was made worse by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819 there were poor economic conditions. That, and the limited suffrage (few people had the vote), inceased the appeal of political radicalism. \nIn response, the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a demonstration to be addressed by the radical orator Henry Hunt. The Manchester Patriotic Union was a group agitating for parliamentary reform.\nShortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the military authorities to arrest Henry Hunt and several others with him, and to the men. Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn. In the resulting confusion, 15 people were killed and 400 to 700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier."}

It extended along the whole 36 miles length of the canal, from Eastham in the west to Manchester in the east, absorbing the Port of Runcorn, which had been created in 1862. The creation of the new port moved the Port of Liverpool's boundary 11 milles to the west. Once delivered to the port, goods travelled as far west as Warrington, about 20 miles north, as far east as Leeds, and up to 100 miles south to Birmingham."}

A Victorian property has several distinguishable characteristics such as brickwork, high ceilings, bay windows, brick porches, and ornate gable trim among others. The term Victorian architecture can refer to one of a number of architectural styles that were employed in the Victorian era. This kind of architecture is named after Queen Victoria. Built-in the late 1800s and early 1900s (during the reign of Queen Victoria), this architecture is a style of its own.\u00a0Gracious, modestly ornate, solidly built and practical, these homes have stood the test of time.

{"id": "210064", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210064", "title": "Rotifer", "text": "The rotifers are a phylum of tiny animals which are common in freshwater environments, such as ponds and puddles. Some rotifers are free swimming, others move by inching along, and some are fixed. A few species live in colonies. \nHistory and taxonomy.\nRotifers were first described when early microscopes became available, around 1700. They are an important part of the freshwater zooplankton. Also, many species help decompose organic matter in soil. Rotifers eat fish waste, dead bacteria, and algae. They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. A rotifer filters 100,000 times its own volume of water per hour. They are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter.\nAbout 2200 species of rotifers have been described. They are placed in the phylum Rotifera. This phylum is subdivided into three classes, \"Monogononta\", \"Bdelloidea\", and \"Seisonidea\". The largest group is the Monogononta, with about 1500 species, followed by the Bdelloidea, with about 350 species. There are only two known species of Seisonidea.\nFossils of the species \"Habrotrocha angusticollis\" have been found in 6000 year old Pleistocene peat deposits. The oldest known fossil rotifers have been found in Eocene Dominican amber.\nAppearance.\nThe front has a ring of cilia circling the mouth. This gave the rotifers their old name of \"wheel animalules\". There is a protective \"lorica\" round its body, and a foot. Inside the lorica are the usual organs in miniturised form: a brain, an eye-spot, jaws, stomach, kidneys, urinary bladder.\nRotifers have a number of unusual features. Biologists suppose that these peculiarities are adaptations to their small size and the transient (fast changing) nature of its habitats.\nResisting drought.\nRotifers are specialists at living in habitats where water dries up regularly. \nThe Monogononta, which have males, produce fertilised 'resting eggs' which can resist desiccation (drought) for long periods. \nThe Bdelloids, who have no males, contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water, a process known as \"cryptobiosis\". Bdelloids can also survive the dry state for long periods: the longest well-documented dormancy is nine years. After they have dried, they may be revived by adding water. In this, and several other ways, they are a unique group of animals.\nCell number.\nRotifers are hatched with a standard number of cell nuclei, exactly the same number for every rotifer in a species. This is called \"eutely\". No cell division whatsoever takes place during adult life. Not only that, but the number of nuclei in each tissue is constant. Furthermore, most of the nuclei do not have cell walls: rotifer tissue is largely or wholly a syncytium.\nResisting radiation.\nThe absence of cell division is probably one reason they are extraordinarily resistant to ionising radiation. Also, repairing DNA is one of the things they are known to do after desiccation.\nBdelloid rotifers.\nParthenogenesis.\nIn one of the classes, the freshwater Bdelloid rotifers, \"no males have ever been seen\". It is the largest group of wholly parthenogenetic species in the Animalia. \nThe females in this group produce eggs by parthenogenesis (virgin birth). In some species these eggs develop into small juveniles before they are released from their parent. The offspring are \"clones\" of their mother. \nCytological and molecular genetic studies show that bdelloids evolved from a common ancestor which lost sexual recombination (meiosis and fertilisation) about 100 million years ago. Research has also been done on the implications of parthenogenesis for speciation.\nGenetics.\nBdelloid rotifer genomes contain two or more non-identical copies of each gene. This suggests their asexual reproduction is of long standing. For example, there are four copies of gene \"hsp82\". Each is different and on a different chromosome. This cannot be explaned by normal gene duplication, which produces two or more near-identical genes next to each other. By contrast, in a monogont rotifer, most genes were single-copy. \nThere are genes in bdelloid rotifers that seem to have come from bacteria, fungi, and plants. This suggests they arrived by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The capture and use of exogenous (~foreign) genes seems to be important in bdelloid evolution. The team led by Matthew S. Meselson at Harvard University showed that, despite the lack of sexual reproduction, bdelloid rotifers do engage in genetic (DNA) transfer within a species or clade. The method used is not known at present. Bdelloid rotifers currently hold the 'record' for HGT in animals with ~8% of their genes from bacterial origins.\nThe Acanthocephala.\nThe Acanthocephala, a group of parasitic worms previously considered to be a separate phylum, have been shown to be modified rotifers. The exact relationship to the normal, freeliving, members of the phylum is not resolved."}
