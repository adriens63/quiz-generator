It was founded in 1630. Boston is one of the oldest, richest and most culturally important cities in the United States.\nHistory.\nBoston was founded on September 7, 1630, by Puritan colonists from England. Boston's early European settlers called the area \"Trimountaine\" (Three Mountains). They renamed the town for Boston, England, in Lincolnshire because many important \"Pilgrim\" colonists came from there.\nMost of Boston's early citizens were Puritans. Shortly after Boston's settlement, Puritans created America's first public school and America's first university, Harvard University (1636). Harvard is in the city of Cambridge, which is across the Charles River from Boston. Until the 1760s, Boston was America's largest city.\nDuring the early 1770s, the British tried to control the thirteen colonies with taxes. This made people from Boston start the American Revolution. The Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, and several early battles happened in or near the city. It held its first town meeting in Faneuil Hall in 1743.\nBoston continued to grow and attract immigrants from around the world. Many immigrants came from Ireland, and gave Boston a very Irish culture that remains today. President John F. Kennedy was a member of an Irish-American family that lived in Boston. Many immigrants also came from Italy, and lived in Boston's North End, where Italian culture remains, with various Italian stores, restaurants, bakeries, and homes.\nOn 15 April 2013, two bombs exploded at the Boston Marathon.\nGeography.\nBoston is located on the Shawmut Peninsula. The city covers 48 square miles. Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean is located east of the city. A much larger metropolitan area surrounds Boston.\nThe highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill, at 330 feet above sea level. The lowest point is at sea level. Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with an ocean coastline.\nClimate.\nBoston has a continental climate with some ocean effects. Summers are normally warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters alternate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild. Existing wind patterns that blow offshore lower the effect of the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe hottest month is July, with an average temperature of . The coldest month is January, with an average of . Extremes have ranged from on February 9, 1934, up to on July 4, 1911.\nBoston's location on the North Atlantic moderates its temperature, but makes the city very likely to suffer from Nor'easter storm systems that can produce much snow and rain. The city averages of precipitation a year, with of snowfall per year.\nTowers.\nThe tallest towers in Boston are the Prudential Tower and the John Hancock Tower.\nCulture.\nBoston has a culture that is quite similar to New England, such as a New England accent and foods that are mostly seafood, salt, and dairy products. Irish-Americans are very important in Boston's politics and religious activities. Boston people also have a style of talking which is called Boston slang.\nIt is often thought that Bostonians have a strong sense of culture. Perhaps this is because Boston is famous for being a very intellectual place, with much of its culture coming from its universities. The city has many complex theatres, including the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Boston Opera House, Citi Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre. The headquarters of Unitarian Universalism (UU) is located in Boston. The Christian Science movement has also made its home in the Boston area.\nBoston has many historic places and Bostonians take pride in their city's history. The American Revolution began in Boston, and many of its leaders, such as Samuel Adams, John Adams, John Hancock, and Paul Revere were from the city. Many of the sites from the Revolution are preserved in the city, including Faneuil Hall, the Old State House, Park Street Church, and others. These form the \"Freedom Trail\", a walk that takes visitors past many historic places in the city.\nBoston today.\nBoston is one of the United States' most important cities in education and health care. Boston and the towns around it contain many of the country's leading universities. Harvard, MIT, and Boston University are some of the most famous.\nProfessional sports are an important part of life in Boston. The Red Sox play baseball at Fenway Park, the oldest stadium in Major League Baseball (1912). The Celtics, a basketball team, and the Bruins, a hockey team, both play at the TD Garden. Boston's football team, the New England Patriots, play in Foxborough, a town 22 miles south of the city.\nDemographics.\nPeople.\nIn 2013, the population of Boston was 645,966. The population has grown 9.6% since 2000. Boston has 13,339 people per square mile. The population is 47.8% male and 52.2% female. The racial breakdown is shown in the Racial Groups table. The people from outside the United States are 178,805. 27.7% of the population come from outside of the United States.\nHomeless Population.\nThe unemployment rate in Boston is 5.9% since June 2014. The 35th annual homeless census from 2015 said there were 7,663 homeless men, women, and children in Boston. The homeless population increased 5.6% since 2013. The number of homeless people sleeping on the streets decreased by 22.8% since 2013. However, the number of adults in emergency shelters has grown by 10.9%. In 2015, the homeless family population increased by 25%. The total number of homeless men, woman, families and children increased by 20.9% from 3,541 to 4,281.\nMayor Marty Walsh announced his goal to help those in need for a permanent housing solution. Agencies such as Pine Street Inn, Boston Healthcare, Project Hope, and Boston Public Health Commission are helping the homeless. The homeless are helped by reducing family evictions. Property management companies and nonprofits, such as Project Hope and the Department of Neighborhood Development, will increase affordable housing options. Boston Public Health Commission and the Department of Neighborhood Development will work together to provide support for treatment options and shelters. The Wyman Re-Entry Center has a 90-day residential substance-abuse and recovery program. The Safe Harbor serves adults with HIV. The project SOAR stands for Stability, Opportunity, Achievement, and Recovery, and helps clients maintain a healthy lifestyle and provide support in moving to permanent housing.\nEducation.\nOver 85.6% of the population ages 20 years and over in Boston have a high school diploma or higher in 2013. Those with a Bachelor's degree or higher make up 45.2% of the population.\nSome of the Colleges and Universities in Boston are: \nThere are many more not listed here.\nTransportation.\nThe MBTA runs the city's subway (known as \"the T\"), commuter rail, buses, and ferries. The main airport for the city is Logan International Airport.\nThe main highways for the area are:"}

PQ's main goals are to get independence for Qu\u00e9bec. In the provincial election of 1976, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was elected to the government of Qu\u00e9bec for the first time and Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, became the premier of Quebec. Many French people in Qu\u00e9bec were happy to see the L\u00e9vesque as premier, while many English people were not happy..\nThe PQ passed a bill called Bill 101. This bill is a law that makes French the languages used most in Quebec, even though English and French are the languages spoken in Canada. The party was elected again in the 1981 election, but in November 1984 founder Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque left the party and the PQ lost the 1985 election.\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois started the first Quebec referendum, having the citizens vote to decide to either leave Canada or stay a part of the country. 60 per cent of the people who voted decided to stay in Canada. The PQ had a second referendum in 1995. The citizens once again voted to stay in Canada. The leader of the party, Jacques Parizeau, quit after the referendum failed.\nThe current Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Gilles Duceppe was the first to announce that he would to try to become the leader of the PQ, on May 11, 2007. Pauline Marois also said she was going to try to become leader, but Duceppe changed his mind on the 12th leaving Marois the only candidate. On June 26, 2007 Marois won the leadership. Pauline Marois is the current leader of the PQ. She has said that the PQ plans to have another referendum in the future. On , Marois led her party to minority victory in the Quebec general election, thus becoming the first female premier in the province's history. After an electoral defeat in , she resigned. The current leader of the PQ is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e, elected in 2016.\nRelationship with the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a federal political party in Canada that was made in 1990 by future PQ leader Lucien Bouchard. The Bloc also wants sovereignty for Qu\u00e9bec. The two parties help each other during elections."}

They are: \"straight line\", \"spiral\", and \"vault\".\nHistory.\nWhile being a child, Otto Feick, the son of a blacksmith from Reichenbach, Germany, used to roll down a hill in two wagon tires which inspired him later to invent the wheel gymnastics between 1920-1922. The current wheel gymnastics obtained its final shape in 1974 with the introduction of the PVC coating.

The skills consist of various combinations of somersaults, shaped bounces, body landings and twists performed in various body positions.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1930s, an American gymnast George Nissen observed \"trapeze\" artistes performing tricks when bouncing off the \"safety net\". He made the first modern trampoline in his garage to reproduce that net on a smaller scale and used it to help with his diving and tumbling activities. It was the beginning of a new sport.\nIn the USA, trampolining was quickly introduced into school physical education programs and was also used in private entertainment centers. Since trampolining became an Olympic sport in 2000, many countries have started developing programs for producing very competitive athletes."}

The trunk has eleven segments. They do not have external cilia, but have a number of spines along the body, and up to seven circles of spines around the head. These spines are used for movement. They can pull back the head and push forward; then they can grip the substrate with the spines, and draw up the body.\nThe body wall is a thin layer with a tough cuticle. It is moulted several times during growth. This layer is a syncytium, with nuclei, but no cell membranes.\nThe spines are hollow and covered by cuticle. The head is completely retractable, when is covered by a set of neck plates.\nThe nervous system is a ventral nerve cord, with one ganglion in each segment, and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx.

The phylum includes the first animals known to exist in a completely anoxic environment (no oxygen at all). The phylum was described in 1983 by Reinhardt Kristensen.\nThey are a phylum of very small animals which live in sediment. There are now twenty-two described species, in eight genera. In addition, there are about 100 more species which have been collected, but not yet described. Their size ranges from 100\u00a0\u00b5m to about 1\u00a0mm.\nTheir habitat is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves. They are among the most recently discovered groups of Metazoans. They attach themselves quite firmly to the gravel, and this explains why they remained undiscovered for so long. The first specimen was collected in the 1970s, and later described in 1983. They are found at all depths of water, in different sediment types, and in all latitudes. They have not yet been found in the fossil record.\nAnatomy.\nThese animals have a protective outer case called a lorica. Protected by the lorica, the animals have a head, mouth and digestive system. Development is usually direct, though there are larvae in some species. The animals have two sexes as adults. There are some complex and flexible life cycles with different forms of parthenogenetic reproduction.\nTheir closest relatives are thought to be the Kinorhyncha and Priapulida, with whom they share some characteristics. Together they make up the clade Scalidophora.\nIn anoxic environments.\nThree species of Loricifera have been found in the sediments at the bottom of the L'Atalante basin in the Mediterranean Sea. The 'surface' of this basin is 3,500 meters down. They are the first multicellular organisms known to spend their entire lives in an oxygen-free environment. It is thought they are able to do this because they rely on organelles which, unlike normal mitochondria, do not use oxygen for their energy cycle. They are able to do this because they use hydrogenosomes to get their energy rather than mitochondria.\nThe newly reported animals complete their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen, and they are less than a millimetre in size. They were collected from the deep basin where they live in a nearly salt-saturated brine. This brine, because of its density, does not mix with the waters above. As a result, the brine is completely anoxic, and high in ammonia. Also, due to the action of sulphate reducers, it contains sulphide at a high concentration. In the brine, the abundance of cells is not high. Extremophiles predominate, including members of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent community of archaea and bacteria. Eukaryotes are also found in l'Atalante, including ciliates (45%), dinoflagellates (21%) and choanoflagellata (10%).p360\u2013381\nReferences.\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-2.0 text from references "}

It is called a 'lake' because, though it is under more than two miles of water, it is almost completely separate from the sea above it. Its huge salt content prevents the waters mixing. Sometimes these lakes are called \"brine pools\". They are found in many oceans; there is one in the Gulf of Mexico.\nHow it formed.\nL'Atalante is only one of several such lakes underneath the normal waters of the Mediterranean. When the Strait of Gibraltar was closed, about six million years ago, the Mediterranean dried up and became a huge salt lake, rather like the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake are today. Then it dried out completely, leaving an enormous amount of salt. When the Straight of Gibraltar opened again about five million years ago, water from the Atlantic Ocean rushed in to form the Mediterranean we see today. Even today, the Atlantic feeds the Mediterranean with water, because the evaporation from the 'Med' is greater than is provided by its rivers. With its huge supply of salt underneath, and the constant evaporation, the Med is a high salt sea compared with the Atlantic.\nThe L'Atalanta lake and its neighbours the Urania and Discovery lakes are about 35,000 years old. They were formed by salt deposits dissolving out of the Mediterranean Ridge and collecting in deep depressions at the bottom of the Med. L'Atalante is the smallest of the three. Its surface begins at about below sea level.\nSalt content.\nL'Atalante's salinity (salt content) is near saturation, at 36.5%, about eight times more than seawater. This prevents the water in the brine pool from mixing with the 'normal' seawater above. Without mixing, oxygen from above can't get into the brine pool. The basin's water is completely anoxic: it has no oxygen.\nBetween the normal water and the brine is a short (1.5 metres) boundary zone called a halocline. The salt content rises sharply there, and oxygen reduces towards zero. This halocline between the seawater above and the brine below has many bacterial and archaeal cells: they are chemoautotrophs, which feed on ammonia from the brine but cannot function without some oxygen. Certain methane oxidizers and haloarchaea are found only in the halocline.\nLife without oxygen.\nBelow, in the brine, the number of cells is much lower than in the halocline. Extremophiles are most common, including some of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent archaea and bacteria. Eukaryotes are also found in l'Atalante, mostly ciliates (45%), dinoflagellates (21%) and choanoflagellata (10%).p360\u2013381\nThe dark grey anoxic sediments at the bottom of L'Atalante lake are covered with a loose black layer. Microbes found in the sediments are almost all (90%) various species of \"Bacillus\". In 2010, three metazoan species, all in the Loricifera phylum, were discovered living in the sediment, the first multicellular lifeforms known to live entirely without oxygen."}

This is because the body cannot create enough of the hormone insulin. People with this condition are insulin dependent - they require insulin injections without which they may die. People with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of stroke, heart disease or gangrene. About 15% of people with diabetes have type 1.\nCause.\nType 1 diabetes is a condition caused by a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin is a hormone produced by cells in the pancreas. Insulin is responsible for moving sugars out of the blood and into cells to be used for energy. If insulin is not made, the body will search for other ways to get the sugars needed to feed the body's cells, including breaking down muscle and fat, leading to a loss of weight.\nInsulin is not being produced in the pancreas due to an autoimmune condition attacking its cells. The body's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells responsible for producing insulin in the pancreas, the beta cell, damaging the cells in a way the prevents them from producing more insulin. As more and more cells are damaged, less insulin is produced in the body. This means that more sugar remains in the bloodstream rather than being moved into cells. This high blood sugar causes the symptoms seen in type 1 diabetes.\nThe disease is thought to be strongly linked to genetic factors, but the trigger that starts the autoimmune disease is not currently known.\nEpidemiology.\nIn the past, type 1 diabetes was generally thought to be a disorder in children and teenagers. However, it's now been found that adults can be diagnosed with the disease.\nAlthough type 1 diabetes can now be diagnosed at any age, it is one of the most common chronic conditions in children and young adults. Being diagnosed at ages 5\u20137 or at the start of puberty is particularly common. Type 1 diabetes is also slightly more common in boys.\nCases of type 1 diabetes have been increasing across the world for several decades. Approximately 1 in 300 people are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes by the age of 18 in the United States. If this rate continues, the number of cases of type 1 diabetes could double in the next decade.\nSymptoms.\nIn type 1 diabetes, symptoms generally develop over a few days or weeks, though may take longer in adults. The main symptoms are:\nNausea, vomiting and heavy breathing are more serious symptoms. They occur at a later stage in the disease, and if they're seen a sufferer should be taken to hospital immediately.\nComplications.\nSufferers of type 1 diabetes may have to deal with both short-term and long-term complications, particularly if the disease is not well managed.\nShort term complications.\nHypoglycaemia.\nHypoglycaemia is when blood sugar levels decrease to below normal. This is most commonly due to overuse of medications for diabetes type 1 like insulin or from poor diet control. The risk of suffering from low blood sugar is increased by drinking alcohol. Leads to various symptoms, including confusion, loss of consciousness, clumsiness, seizures or death.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a very serious complication of type 1 diabetes. It is always a medical emergency and requires rapid medical attention to prevent further damage to a patient, if left untreated it can potentially lead to death. DKA occurs when there is not enough insulin in the body to supply sugars to the body's cells. In order to give its cells enough energy to survive, the body begins to produce acidic ketone bodies which are then used to feed energy to the cells.\nIf too many ketone bodies build up the blood becomes acidic, damaging the body and leading to the symptoms:\nLong term complications.\nIf diabetes is not treated, even mildly raised blood sugar levels can damage nerves, organs and blood vessels in the body .\nManagement.\nCurrently, there is no known cure for diabetes. Instead, treatment is designed to help keep blood sugar levels normal in order to reduce the chances of complications developing as the disease progresses. There are two main method that are combined to manage diabetes type 1:\nInsulin injections.\nType 1 diabetes occurs due to the bodies inability to produce its own insulin.

It has singers or bands that sound very different from mainstream or pop country music. \"Alternative country\" has been used to describe country music bands and artists that have influences such as roots rock, bluegrass, rockabilly, Americana, honky-tonk, alternative rock, folk rock, or punk.\nHistory.\nIn the 1990s the term \"alternative country\" (which is like the term alternative rock, which was becoming popular at the same time), began to be used to talk about different groups of musicians and singers who did not follow the same traditions of regular country music, and who had a different sound. Many of them did not follow the high production values (such as spending a lot of money in the recording studio) of the big country music industry at the time, which was mostly based in Nashville, Tennessee.\nLyrics in alternative country might be depressing or about social issues, and often from the heart. They do not follow the clich\u00e9s sometimes used by mainstream country musicians as often. In other ways, the sounds of alternative country artists do not always have much in common. They can include traditional American folk tunes, bluegrass, and other types of sounds. It can be music that does not sound like mainstream rock or country. This has become even more confusing with \"alternative country artists\" saying that they do not want to be called alternative country, with more mainstream artists saying they are alternative country, and with people saying that older musicians or musicians from the past are alternative country. \"No Depression\", the most popular magazine about alternative country, said that it covered \"alternative-country music (whatever that is)\". \nEven though not everybody agrees on what makes music \"alternative country\", most people agree that alternative country came from traditional American country music.\nIn the 1980s, in southern California, some musicians tried to make some music that had parts of country and parts of punk. This was called the \"cowpunk scene\". It had bands like Jason and the Scorchers. These styles came together in Uncle Tupelo's popular album \"No Depression\", which came out in 1990. Many people think it was the first alternative country album. A magazine called \"No Depression\" later came out that was written about alternative country. The magazine was named after Uncle Tupelo's album. The band made three more important albums and joined a big record label. The band broke up in 1994. Musicians in the band and people around the band later started three other important alternative country bands: Wilco, Son Volt and Bottle Rockets. Bottle Rockets signed, along with acts like Freakwater, The Old 97's and Robbie Fulks, to the Chicago-based indie record label, Bloodshot. They played a type of alternative country called \"insurgent country\". The bands Blue Mountain, Whiskeytown, Blood Oranges and Drive-By Truckers kept going in this direction before most began to move more in the direction of rock music in the 2000s."}

{"id": "253434", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253434", "title": "Constitution of Australia", "text": "The Constitution of Australia is the law that set up the Australian Commonwealth Government and says how it works. It is made up of several documents. The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The people of Australia voted in referendums from 1898\u20131900 to accept the Constitution. The Constitution was then passed as a part of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Imp), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Queen Victoria signed it on 9 July 1900. The Constitution became law on 1 January 1901. Even though the Constitution was an Act of the United Kingdom parliament, the Australia Acts took away the power of the United Kingdom parliament to change the Constitution. Now only the Australian people can change it by referendum. \nTwo other laws support the Australian Constitution. The first is the Statute of Westminster, as passed by the Commonwealth as the \"Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942.\" The second is the \"Australia Act 1986\", which was passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state, the United Kingdom, and the Australian Federal Parliament. Together, these Acts had the effect of cutting all constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom. Even though the same person, Queen Elizabeth II, is the monarch of both countries, these are now separate countries.\nUnder Australia's common law system, the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have the power to decide what the constitution actually means.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Constitution of Australia began with moves towards federation in the 19th century. The Australian colonies joined together to form the Commonwealth of Australian in 1901.\nFederation..\nIn the mid-19th century, the Australian colonies needed to work together on things that affected them all, especially tariffs between the colonies. This cooperation led to plans to join the colonies together in a single federation. The push to do this came mainly from Britain and there was little local support. The smaller colonies thought they would be taken over by the larger ones. Victoria and New South Wales did not agree about the need to protect local industry, as opposed to allowing everyone to trade freely. The then-recent American Civil War also weakened the case for federalism. These difficulties led to the failure of several attempts to bring about federation in the 1860s and 1850s.\nBy the 1880s Australians were worried about the growing presence of the Germans and the French in the Pacific. Along with a growing Australian identity, this created the opportunity to start the first inter-colonial body, the Federal Council of Australasia, in 1885. This Federal Council could make laws on certain subjects, but did not have a permanent office, an executive, or its own source of income. New South Wales, the largest colony, would not take part.\nHenry Parkes, the Premier of New South Wales, pushed for a series of conferences in the 1890s to talk about federalism. The first was in Melbourne in 1890, and another, the National Australasian Convention, in Sydney in 1891. These were attended by colonial leaders. By the 1891 conference, many people wanted a federal system. Most of the discussion was about how this federal system would work. With help from Sir Samuel Griffith, a draft constitution was written. These meetings did not have popular support. The draft constitution also left out important, but difficult, issues, such as tariff policy. The draft of 1891 was given to colonial parliaments but was not supported by New South Wales. Without New South Wales, the other colonies were unwilling to continue.\nIn 1895, the six premiers of the Australian colonies agreed to set up a new Convention by popular vote. The Convention met over the course of a year from 1897 to 1898. The meetings produced a new Constitution that was the same as the 1891 draft, but with added provisions for responsible government. To get popular support, the draft was voted on by the electors of each colony. After one failed attempt, a changed draft was given to the electors of each colony except Western Australia. Five colonies passed the Bill that was then sent to the Westminster Parliament with a letter requesting the Queen to make it into law.\nThe British government made one change before the Bill was passed. The Chief Justices of the colonies wanted the right to appeal decisions of the High Court to the Privy Council on constitutional matters. They were worried that the limits of the powers of the Commonwealth or States could be changed by parliament. The British Parliament passed the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\" in 1900. Western Australia finally agreed to join the Commonwealth in time for it to join the Commonwealth of Australia, which officially began on 1 January 1901.\nIn 1990, the Public Records Office in London loaned the original copy 1900 of the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\" to Australia. The Australian government wanted to keep the copy. The British parliament agreed by passing the \"Australian Constitution (Public Record Copy) Act 1990\".\nThe Statute of Westminster and the Australia Acts.\nAlthough Federation made Australia independent of Britain, legally the Commonwealth was a creation of the British Imperial Parliament, through the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\" 1900 (Imp), which applied to Australia. As a result, there was continued uncertainty as to whether British Imperial laws still applied to the Commonwealth. This was fixed by the \"Statute of Westminster 1931\", adopted by the Commonwealth via the \"Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942\". The Statute of Westminster freed the Dominions, including the Commonwealth, from Imperial laws and controls. Legally, this is the moment of Australia's national independence.\nHowever, British laws were still more important in Australian states. This was fixed by the \"Australia Act 1986\", which was passed by the parliaments of Australia, the United Kingdom, and each of the states. This law stopped the British Parliament's power to make laws over Australian states. It also stopped appeals from the Australian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. As this was a very important document, Queen Elizabeth II travelled to Australia to sign the proclamation of the law.\nOne result of these two laws is that Australia is now a fully independent country. The Constitution is now different from the original Act, as the Australian people can change the Constitution, by referendum. However, the original Act remains on the UK's law book with a note saying, \"The Constitution is not necessarily in the form in which it is in force in Australia\". Even if the United Kingdom Parliament were to remove the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900\", it would have no effect on Australia.\nArticles.\nThe \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900\" (Imp) contains a Preamble, and nine sections. Sections 1\u2013 8 are the laws to set up the Commonwealth. Section 9, starting with the words \"The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows ...\", contains the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Constitution itself is in eight chapters, with 128 sections.\nThe Parliament.\nChapter I sets up the Parliament of Australia. This has three parts:\nSection 1 says that legislative power belongs to the Parliament. It is the most powerful part of government.\nPart II of Chapter 1 is about the Senate. Senators are to be \"directly chosen by the people of the State\", voting as a single electorate. Each State is to have the same number of senators. Currently, there are 12 senators for each State, and 2 each for the mainland territories, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.\nPart III of Chapter 1 is about the House of Representatives. Section 24 says the House must have twice as many members as the Senate, each elected by a single electorate. This is called the 'Nexus'. It designed to prevent swamping of the senate's power in the case of a joint sitting (see Section 57 below). The number of electorates in a State is to be based on its share of the national population.\nPart IV of Chapter 1 says who can vote, who can be elected to the parliament, how much members can be paid, parliamentary rules and related matters.\nPart V of Chapter 1 is about the powers of the parliament. Section 51 deals with powers of the Commonwealth parliament and are called \"specific powers\". There are also \"concurrent powers\", and both the Commonwealth and the States can make laws on these subjects. Federal law is more important if the laws are different (Section 109). Of the thirty-nine parts of section 51, a few have become very important in deciding how much power the Commonwealth government has in law. These include the Trade and Commerce Power, the Corporations Power and the External Affairs Power. Section 52 deals with powers that belong only to the Commonwealth parliament. States cannot make laws on these subjects.\nThe Executive Government.\nChapter II sets up the executive branch of government. Executive power is to be exercised by the Governor-General, advised by the Federal Executive Council. The Governor-General is the commander in chief. He or she may appoint and dismiss the members of the Executive Council, ministers of state, and all officers of the executive government. These powers, along with the powers to dissolve (or refuse to dissolve) parliament (Section 5, Section 57), are termed \"reserve powers\". The use of these powers is by convention. Generally, the Governor-General acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister. There has been only one instance of the Governor-General not taking the Prime Minister's advice. Governor-General Sir John Kerr, acting on his own, dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.\nReserve powers in all Westminster nations are only \"extremely\" rarely exercised outside of the understood conventions. However, in contrast with the constitutions of other Commonwealth Realms such as Canada, which formally grant extensive reserve powers to the Monarch, even the formal powers of the Queen of Australia are extremely limited, and most powers can be used only by the Governor-General.\nSection 68 says that the Command in chief of Australia's naval and military forces \"is vested in the Governor General as the Queen's representative\". The Commander in chief of the Australian Defence Force is now Her Excellency Quentin Bryce as the Governor General of Australia. The Queen of Australia is not in command of the military.\nThe Judicature.\nChapter III sets up the judicial branch of government. Section 71 gives judicial power to a \"Federal Supreme Court\" called the High Court of Australia. The Parliament can also make new federal courts or give other courts federal powers. Such courts, called \"Chapter III Courts\", are the only courts that can use federal judicial power. Sections 73 and 75-78 outline the original and appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. Section 74 explains how an appeal can be made to the Queen in Council. Section 79 allows Parliament to limit the number of judges able to exercise federal jurisdiction and section 80 guarantees trial by jury for indictable offences against the Commonwealth.\nFinance and Trade.\nChapter IV deals with finance and trade in the federal system. Section 81 says that all Commonwealth revenue shall form the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Parliament can make laws as to the how its money is spent (Section 53). Unlike most other powers of the parliament, laws made under this power cannot usually be challenged. Section 90 gives the Commonwealth exclusive power over duties of custom and excise.\nSection 92 provides that \"trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States shall be \"absolutely free\"\". The precise meaning of this phrase is the subject of a considerable body of law.\nSection 96 gives the Commonwealth power to give money to States \"on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit\". This power is not limited by any other part of the Constitution, such as Section 99 that forbids giving preference to one State or over another State. It is subject only to Section 116, freedom of religion, and possibly other such freedoms. This power, which was only meant to be used (\"during a period of ten years ... and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides\"), has been used by the Commonwealth to encourage cooperation by the States to various extents over the years.\nSection 101 sets up an Inter-State Commission, a body which is no longer exists, but which was meant to have a significant role in the federal structure.\nThe States.\nChapter V says what the States can do in a federal system. Sections 106-108 preserve the Constitution, the powers of the Parliament, and the laws in force of each of the States.\nSection 109 says that, where a State law is different to a federal law, the federal law applies.\nSection 111 says that a State can give up any part of its lands to the Commonwealth. This has happened several times. South Australia gave the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth.\nSection 114 stops any state from having its own military force. It also stops the State or the Commonwealth taxing each other's property.\nSection 116 sets out \"freedom of religion\", by stopping \"the Commonwealth\" from making any law to start a religion, to impose any religious observance, or to stop a religion, and by stopping religious discrimination for public office.\nNew States.\nChapter VI allows new states to be made, or to join the Commonwealth. Section 122 allows the Parliament to provide for the representation in Parliament of any new territory. Section 123 says that changing the boundaries of a State needs the support of the Parliament of that State and must pass a referendum in that State.\nNo new states have joined the Commonwealth since federation.\nMiscellaneous.\nChapter VII says that the seat of government of the Commonwealth (now Canberra) shall be in New South Wales but no less than one hundred miles from Sydney, and that the Governor-General may appoint deputies. Section 127 first said that Aborigines cannot be counted in any Commonwealth or State census. This section was changed in 1967.\nAlteration of the Constitution.\nChapter VIII sets out how the Constitution can be changed. Section 128 says that changes must be approved by a referendum. A successful change needs:\nThe Governor-General must put the referendum bill to the people between two and six months after passing parliament. After the constitutional amendment bill has passed both the parliament and the referendum, it then receives Royal Assent from the Governor-General. This makes it the new law and the wording of the Constitution is changed.\nAn exception to this process is if the amendment bill is rejected by one house of Federal Parliament. If the bill passes the first house and is rejected by the second, then after three months the first house may pass it again. If the bill is still rejected by the second house, then the Governor-General may choose to still put the bill to the people's vote.\nChanges.\nAs mentioned above, changing the Constitution requires a referendum in which the \"Yes\" vote achieves a majority nationally, as well as majorities in a majority of states.\nForty-four proposals to change the Constitution have been voted on at referendums. Eight have been approved. The following is a list of changes that have been approved.\nThe role of conventions.\nAs well as the written Constitution and Letters Patent issued by the Crown, conventions are an important part of the Constitution. These have developed over the years and define how various constitutional mechanisms work in practice.\nConventions play a powerful role in the operation of the Australian constitution because of its set-up and operation as a Westminster system of responsible government. Some important conventions include:\nHowever, because conventions are not written down, their existence and practice are open to debate. Real or alleged violation of convention has often led to political controversy. One extreme case was the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, in which the operation of conventions was seriously tested. The ensuing constitutional crisis was resolved dramatically when the Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed the Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister pending the 1975 general election. A number of conventions were said to be broken during this episode. These include:\nInterpretation.\nIn line with the common law tradition in Australia, the law on the interpretation and application of the Constitution has developed largely through judgments by the High Court of Australia. In a number of important cases, the High Court has developed several \"doctrines\" which underlie the interpretation of the Australian Constitution. Some examples include:\nThe vast majority of constitutional cases before the High Court deal with characterisation: whether new laws are part of the power granted to the Commonwealth government by the Constitution.\nCriticism.\nProtection of rights.\nThe Australian Constitution does not include a Bill of Rights. Some people at the 1898 Constitutional Convention wanted a Bill of Rights like the United States Constitution, but the majority felt that the traditional rights and freedoms of British subjects were enough. These would be protected by the Parliamentary system and independent judiciary which the Constitution would create. As a result, the Australian Constitution has often been criticised for not protecting rights and freedoms.\nSome rights were included:\nIn 1992 and 1994, the High Court of Australia found that the Constitution gave an \"implied\" right to freedom of political communication, in a series of cases including the \"Australian Capital Television\" case and the \"Theophanous\" case. This was seen as a necessary part of the democratic system created by the Constitution. The application of this \"implied right\" has, however, been restricted in later cases, such as \"Lange v ABC\". It is in no way equivalent to a freedom of speech, and only protects individuals against the government trying to limit their political communication: it offers no protection against other individuals.\nIn 2007, the High Court of Australia in \"Roach v Electoral Commissioner\" said that sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution, by providing that members of the House of Representatives and the Senate be \"directly chosen by the people\", created a limited right to vote. This means that there is a universal franchise in principle, and limited the Federal Parliament's legislative power to change it. In the case, a legislative change to stop all prisoners from voting (as opposed to only those serving sentences of three years or more, as it was before the amendment) was rejected as breaking that right.\nOther attempts to find other \"implied rights\" in High Court cases have not been successful.\nPreamble.\nWhile a \"pro forma\" preamble prefaces the Imperial \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900\", the Australian Constitution itself does not have a preamble. There have been some calls to add one to express the spirit and aspirations embodied in the constitution. However, there has been fierce opposition, usually on the basis of the content of the preamble, as well as possible legal ramifications of this text. In 1999, a proposed preamble, written by John Howard, the then Prime Minister, was defeated in a referendum held concurrently with the Republic referendum. The \"Yes\" vote (in favour of the insertion of the preamble) did not achieve a majority in any of the six states.\nRepublic proposals.\nThere have been many people who have wanted Australia to become a republic. On 6 November 1999, Australians did not support a law to remove the Queen and replace the Governor-General with a President. The President was to be appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. Opinion poll results said that the majority of Australians were in favour of some form of a republic. Many voters who voted against the 1999 referendum wanted to be able to vote for a President. In research and polling following the 1999 referendum, people said that an appointed President would not be able to act independently of the Parliament. By being able to appoint the President, rather than having the people elect a President, many felt that too much power was being given to Parliament with no check or balance on that power. Support for holding another referendum in the near future seems to be growing, and another referendum may be held. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the current (2012) situation \"no longer reflects either the fundamental democratic principles that underpin the Australian nation or its diversity\". He was thinking about a referendum for an independent, elected President. He went on to say that \"over the next year there would be an \"accelerated public debate\" about the monarchy question\".\nCommemoration.\nConstitution Day is celebrated on 9 July, the date the Constitution became law in 1900. The date is not a public holiday. Constitution Day was first held on 9 July 2000 to mark the centenary of the Constitution as part of the Centenary of Federation. The celebrations were not big and have not been widely held after 2001. Constitution Day was revived in 2007 and is jointly organised by the National Archives of Australia, which holds the original Constitution documents, and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship."}

Wildlife management can include game keeping, wildlife conservation and pest control. Wildlife management has become an integrated science using disciplines such as mathematics, chemistry, biology, ecology, climatology and geography to gain the best results.\nWildlife conservation aims to halt the loss of species. It does this by taking using ecological principles to balance the needs of wildlife with the needs of people. Most wildlife is concerned with the preservation and improvement of habitats. Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, irrigation, coppicing and hedge laying.\nGame keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the wellbeing of game birds. It may include killing other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of the more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book \"Game Management\", Aldo Leopold, one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as \"the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use\"."}

He built and improved upon the first helicopter that could be used.\nBiography.\nIgor Sikorsky was born on May, 25, 1889, in Kyiv.\nSikorsky graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps (1903\u20131906) in Saint Petersburg and the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (1907\u20131911). He studied at the Paris Technical School (1906).\nOn February 18, 1918, he emigrated to the French Republic (Paris), and in March, 1919 he moved to the United States. Until 1923, he had no his own income, sometimes he gave pilot lessons and lectured in secondary schools. But it was changed in 1923, when he founded an aviation company, later Sikorsky became the owner of the design and construction company \"Sikorsky Aircraft\". By 1939 he had built about 15 types of aircraft.\nIn 1925-1940, he developed a series of successful aircraft that brought many records to the United States.\nBuilt in 1934 by Pan American World Airways, the Sikorsky S-42 set ten world records, and 10 S-42s became the world's first intercontinental passenger liners to operate regular flights across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\nHis helicopter was first shown to be useful when he added a winch on it. Soon after this, it saved the lives of two sailors during a hurricane.\nHe also started Sikorsky Aircraft, a huge helicopter manufacturing company which produces famous helicopters such as the Sea King and Skycrane.\nHe died on October 26, 1972 in Easton. Since his death, his office at Sikorsky Aircraft has been left.\nHonours.\nIgor Sikorsy has received more than 80 different high honors and a rare Wright Brothers Memorial Award.\nHe was named a Honorary Doctor of many universities around the world.\nIn 1979, the IAC immortalized the name of Igor Sikorsky in the name of a crater on the moon.\nSince 1980, the American Helicopter Association has awarded the Sikorsky Prize.\nIn 1987, a square in the Primorsky District of St. Petersburg was named after Igor Sikorsky.\nIn August 2008, an exhibition dedicated to Igor Sikorsky was organized in the Lviv gallery.\nOn July 8, 2010 by the decision of the Kyiv City Council the name of Igor Sikorsky was assigned to the Aerospace Lyceum of the National Aviation University.\nOn October 27, 2011, Tankova Street in Kyiv was renamed by Kyiv City Council to Aviakonstruktora Igor Sikorsky Street.\nIn 2011, the main belt asteroid \"10090 Sikorsky\" was named in honour of Igor Sikorsky.\nIn 2015, one of the streets in Vinnytsia was named after Igor Sikorsky.\nIn 2016, Kyiv International Airport (formerly Zhulyany Airport) was named after Sikorsky.\nIn 2016, the National Technical University of Ukraine Kyiv Polytechnic Institute was named after Igor Sikorsky.\nIn 2016, the Museum of the Ukrainian Diaspora opened the first historical and memorial exhibition project \"Our Sikorsky\", which now operates on a permanent basis.\nA monument to Igor Sikorsky was opened near the Sikorsky Airport in Kyiv on August 31, 2019, on Ukrainian Aviation Day."}

Food infection is when the food contains bacteria or other microbes which infect the body after it is eaten. Food intoxication is when the food contains toxins, including bacterially produced exotoxins, which can happen even when the microbe that produced the toxin is no longer present or able to cause infection. Even though it is commonly called \"food poisoning\", most cases are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, prions or parasites that contaminate food, rather than chemical or natural toxins which are what we usually call poison. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 76 million people in the United States become ill from the food they eat, and about 5,000 of them die every year.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSymptoms start within hours to many days after eating. Depending on what the cause of the poisoning was, they can include one or more of the following: nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, fever, pain in the head or fatigue.\nIn most cases the body is able to permanently get better after a short period of acute discomfort and illness. Food borne illnesses can result in permanent health problems or even death, especially for people at high risk, including babies, young children, pregnant women (and their fetuses), elderly people, sick people and others with weak immune systems.\nFood borne illness due to \"Campylobacter\", \"Yersinia\", \"Salmonella\" or \"Shigella\" infection is a major cause of reactive arthritis, which typically occurs 1\u20133 weeks after diarrheal illness. Similarly, people with liver disease are especially susceptible to infections from \"Vibrio vulnificus\", which can be found in oysters or crabs.\nTetrodotoxin poisoning from reef fish and other animals shows up very quickly in symptoms such as numbness and shortness of breath, and is often fatal."}

The water which goes into it does not flow into any ocean.\nBadwater Basin is the lowest point in North America, at below sea level. Mount Whitney, the highest point in the 48 states, is only 76 miles west of the Basin. It is one of the lowest places in Death Valley.\nBadwater Basin has a small natural pool of undrinkable water next to the road. The water comes from a spring. It is called 'Badwater' because people cannot drink the water. This is because so much salt has built up from the basin. The pool does have animals and plants living there, including pickleweed, insects, and the Badwater snail.\nThe pool is not actually the lowest point of the basin. The lowest point is several miles to the west, the exact point which is lowest changes. However, the salt flats are dangerous to travel across (in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud), therefore the sign states that the lowest point is at the pool, where people can see it. Some people say that it is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere, but this is not true. The lowest point is actually Laguna del Carb\u00f3n in Argentina at -105 meters (-344 feet).\nGeography.\nAt Badwater Basin, big rainstorms sometimes flood the bottom of the valley. They cover the salt pan with a thin sheet of standing water. This makes new lakes, but the lakes do not last long. This is because the average of rain that falls every year is much lower than the a 150-inch annual evaporation rate, so all the water evaporates away. This means that even a 12-foot-deep, 30-mile-long lake would dry up in a single year. While the basin is flooded, some of the salt dissolves and goes back into the basin as clean crystals when the water evaporates.\nPainted on the cliff above Badwater is a sign that says \"Sea Level\" which people visiting like to look at.\nHistory.\nDuring the Holocene, when the regional climate was less dry, streams that ran from mountains in the area slowly filled Death Valley until it was 3 feet (1m) deep. Eventually, there was a long lake, Lake Manly.\nThe wet times with much rain did not last. The temperature got warmer, and there was less rain. The lake began to dry up, and as the water evaporated, the lake became saltier. Eventually, only a soup of brine was left. Salts (95% table salt: NaCl) began to turn into crystals, covering the surface with a thick crust from three inches to five feet thick (1-1.7m)."}

This meant that Greece and Turkey would still be poor and Truman believed that a poor Eastern Europe would convert to a Communist government more easily unless helped by the United States. Truman wrongly thought that the Soviets were helping the Greek Communist partisans when there was no clear proof.\nThis plan was a big change to American politics.

{"id": "253569", "revid": "595018", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253569", "title": "John Joseph Woods", "text": "John Joseph Woods was a New Zealand teacher and songwriter. He is best known for winning a competition to set \"God Defend New Zealand\", a poem by Thomas Bracken, to music. By doing this, he composed the tune to what later became New Zealand's national anthem. Woods was also the Tuapeka County Council clerk for 55 years.\nLife.\nPersonal life.\nWoods was born in Tasmania in 1849 into an Irish family with fourteen other children, seven boys and seven girls. His father was a soldier. After teaching in Tasmania for nine years, he came to New Zealand as a young man and worked for a time in Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill. Eight years teaching in New Zealand led to a position as the head teacher of St Patrick's School in Lawrence, Otago, and he moved there from Invercargill in 1874. Woods was known as a good musician. He was choirmaster of the local Catholic church, and could play twelve different instruments, though he was best known for his skill on the violin. Singing a solo at his own wedding, Woods showed that he was also a good singer.\nWhile in Lawrence, Woods taught with an Irish widow called Harriet Conway (n\u00e9e Plunket) who already had two sons. They were married in September 1874 and had four children together, three sons and a daughter named Mary.\nIn 1902, Woods built a house of brick and wood on the corner of Lismore and Lancaster Streets. He lived there until he died in 1934. It is now under the care of the Historic Places Trust, which mounted a plaque on the street-facing back wall to remember his composition of the national anthem.\nComposition of the national anthem.\nOne night in the winter of June 1876, Woods read about the competition in the \"Saturday Advertiser\". According to tradition, he usually met the coach that delivered the news in the main street of Lawrence to pick up his paper. It was already 9\u00a0pm, but he went straight to his piano and in that one sitting composed the tune for what later became the national anthem. In a later letter to A.H. Reed, he explained that the words inspired him so much he had to write music for them. He entered his composition under the pen name of \"Orpheus\". The \"Advertiser\" sent it off with the eleven other submissions to Melbourne, where it was judged. In October 1876, it was announced that the three judges all agreed that Woods' composition was the clear winner. The prize was ten guineas.\nThe rules of the competition meant that the copyright of the music would belong to the \"Saturday Advertiser\", which gave the manuscript to the Dunedin-based Charles Begg &amp; Co to publish, but a nine-month delay in sending it to a publisher was followed by two months of waiting for it to be printed. The end result was a very poor edition with only one verse, which was thrown out by the \"Advertiser\". When promises of reprint failed to come true, the \"Advertiser\" was forced to hand the copyright back over to Woods. He immediately arranged for it to be printed by Hopwood and Crew in London, with Bracken's blessing. Bracken did not mean for his poem to become the national anthem, and it was Woods who had always used the word \"anthem\" where Bracken called it a \"hymn\".\nBeing a choirmaster, Woods' focus in composing the melody was to make it simple and easy for children to sing. This proved to help its success when the Premier George Grey visited Lawrence on 11 March 1878 and was welcomed by six hundred local schoolchildren singing what was by then beginning to be labelled as the \"national anthem\". Grey was very taken by the music and immediately sent a telegram to Bracken congratulating him.\nCounty clerk.\nIn 1877, Woods stopped teaching and became the county clerk for the Tuapeka County Council. He was known for working 13-hour days and keeping accounts of such a high standard that he was accepted as a fellow of the Registered Accountants of New Zealand. Serving in this role, he also became known as an authority on county law, sought out by the council and clerks of other regions. He also organised the decoration of council office buildings to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897.\nHe served in that role for 55 years until ill health forced him to retire in 1932, aged 83.\nOther honours.\nWoods was deeply involved in the affairs of the town. He was a member of many local clubs and societies. He was also known as an expert on cultivating daffodils, of which his collection was the largest in the area. In 1884, Woods was elected first president of the local choral society.\nWhen Woods was made an Honorary Freeman of New Zealand, he was commended for his \"efficiency, integrity and devotion to duty\"."}

They play in the Eredivisie and also in the UEFA Champions League.\nTwente plays its games in the Grolsch Veste (a capacity of 30 000).\nFC Twente currently holds the national cup and the Johan Cruijff Schaal. In season 2010/11 they ended second in the league.\nHistory.\nFC Twente was founded on 1 July 1965 as a combination of Sportclub Enschede and Enschedes Boys. The two professional football teams in Enschede at that time (Sportclub Enschede and Enschedese Boys) had both money problems and were forced to merge. FC Twente started in the Eredivisie (highest Dutch league) and within a few years they were part of the top of Dutch football. Between 1970 and 1980 they came close to several prizes, but they always lost the final. In 1974 the ended second in the Eredivisie and in 1975 the lost the Dutch cup final as well as the UEFA Cup final (after beating Juventus in the semi-final). Only in 1978 they won the Dutch Cup (by beating PEC Zwolle in the final with 3-0). In the next decade (1980-1990) the club went down hill, with the relegation to the Eerste Divisie (second tier of Dutch football) in 1983 as all-time low. Twente was back in the Eredivisie within a year however. In the nineties Twente played a modest role in Dutch football, usually ending around the 5th place in the Eredivisie. \nIn the first decade of the 21st century the golden era started. In 2001 FC Twente won the Dutch cup by beating PSV Eindhoven in the final with a penalty shootout. This victory caused huge celebrations in the eastern part of the Netherlands. This showed the popularity of the club in the region, eventhough FC Twente almost never wins a prize. In 2003 the club almost went bankrupt and Joop Munsterman took over as chairman. He understood the potential of this club and developed a plan to increase the sportive, economic and social capacity of Twente. In 2008 the stadium size was increased from 13,500 to 24,000 seats. In 2011 the stadium was further increased to 30,000 seats. FC Twente again played on the top of the Dutch league, resulting in their first national title in 2010. Also the Intertoto Cup was won in 2006, the Johan Cruijff Schaal was won in 2010 and 2011 and the Dutch cup in 2011. In these years FC Twente also started a social programm to help unemployed people to find a job, encourage handicaped people to do sports and to give away free seats in the stadium to people that cannot afford a ticket.\nCurrent squad.\n\"For recent transfers, see List of Dutch football transfers winter 2011\u201312 and List of Dutch football transfers summer 2012.\""}

Web services use this protocol to communicate. SOAP uses XML to encode a message. It uses other application-layer protocols, for transport, and content negotiation, for example HTTP and Remote procedure call. The most common combination is to use SOAP with HTTP and TCP. There are different versions, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. Before version 1.2 SOAP stood for Simple Object Access Protocol. Since version 1.2 the protocol is simply called \"SOAP\". This is because the protocol is not \"simple\", and that it can be used for other purposes than accessing objects. \nIntroduction.\nSOAP is a lightweight protocol intended for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP uses XML technologies to define an extensible messaging framework, which provides a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols. The framework has been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other implementation specific semantics.\nMessaging Framework.\nThe core section of the SOAP specification is the messaging framework. The SOAP messaging framework defines a suite of XML elements for \"packaging\" arbitrary XML messages for transport between systems. \nThe framework consists of the following core XML elements: Envelope, Header, Body, and Fault, all of which are from the http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/ namespace in SOAP 1.1. I've provided the full XML Schema definition for SOAP 1.1 in the following code for your reference as you read through the remainder of this section. Personally, I find it helpful to inspect the schema whenever familiarizing myself with XML constructs.SOAP UI is a tool use to test whether SOAP is sending and receiving the messages properly as part of Unit testing in IT projects."}

His face and body were deformed because of an illness. To earn money, he was shown at freak shows. He was called the Elephant Man. He then became famous after he went to live at the London Hospital. Some people who wrote about him wrongly thought he was called John Merrick. \nEarly life.\nMerrick was born in Leicester, England in 5 August 1862. He started to become deformed when he was very young. He was also disabled after he hurt his hip. When he was 10, his mother died and his father married another woman. Merrick left school aged 13 and tried to find a job but it was difficult because he was deformed and disabled. His father and stepmother did not want him at home so he left home. When he was 17, he went to live in a workhouse.\nCareer.\nIn 1884 Merrick wrote to a showman called Sam Torr. Merrick asked Torr to show him as a \"freak\" exhibition. Torr showed Merrick around the East Midlands, and then Merrick went to London. He stayed in a shop on Whitechapel Road. People would pay to look at him. A surgeon doctor, Frederick Treves, came to see Merrick and took photographs of him. Soon afterwards, Torr's freak shop was closed by the police and Merrick went to Belgium.\nIn Belgium, Merrick was robbed by his manager and left Brussels alone. He found his way back to London. Frederick Treves took him to the London Hospital where Treves worked. Merrick was allowed to live there for the rest of his life. Rich and famous people of Victorian London came to visit him there.\nDeath.\nMerrick died on 11 April 1890, aged 27. He died of either asphyxia (not being able to breathe properly) or a broken neck. He had tried to lie down to go to sleep, but his head was too heavy for him to do that. Today, nobody knows for sure what was wrong with Merrick. Scientists think that he either had an illness called neurofibromatosis type I, one called Proteus syndrome, or both of these illnesses. In 1980, movie director David Lynch made a movie about Merrick. It is called \"The Elephant Man\"."}

In 1928, he showed the world's first colour television transmission. \nBroadcasting.\nIn 1927, Baird made a signal go over between London and Glasgow; Baird sent the world's first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station.\nBaird then started the Baird Television Development Company Ltd, and in 1928 it made the first transatlantic television transmission, from London to Hartsdale, New York, and the first television programme for the BBC.\nBaird's television systems were replaced by the electronic television system developed by EMI-Marconi.\nBaird did lots of work for the field of electronic television after mechanical systems stopped being used. In 1939, he showed colour television using a cathode ray tube. \nOther inventions.\nSome of Baird's early inventions did not work. In his twenties he tried to make diamonds by heating graphite and ruined Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird made a glass razor which did not get rusty\nLater years.\nFrom December 1944 until he died two years later, Baird lived at a house in Station Road, Bexhill-on-Sea, immediately north of the station.

Because of this, some people say that 80% of all \"AIDS orphans\" still have one parent who is still alive.\nThere are 70,000 new AIDS orphans a year. People in the past have guessed that by the year 2010, over 20 million children would be AIDS orphans.\nBecause most people who get AIDS are people who have sex, most people who die of AIDS are people who make most of their family's money (because most people who have sex are old enough to work). This means that many AIDS orphans need help from their country's government to live, and need money. This happens a lot in Africa especially.\nIn 2007, South Africa had more AIDS orphans than any other country, (although South Africa uses the term \"AIDS orphan\" differently than UNICEF and WHO. South Africa uses the term to talk about children under age 18 who lost either their father or their mother to AIDS). In 2005, the country with the highest percentage of AIDS orphans among the country's orphans was Zimbabwe. "}

The company used to be known as Mercedes-Ilmor. They are owned by Mercedes-Benz. Since 1995, their engines have been used by the McLaren Formula One race cars. For the season, Mercedes-Benz also supplied the Brawn GP and Force India teams with engines. In the season Mercedes supplied McLaren, Force India. They also supplied the engines for the new Mercedes-Benz factory team, Mercedes GP, which was formed from the Brawn GP team.\nBackground.\nIlmor was founded by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan in 1983, as an independent British Formula One engine manufacturer. The company name was taken from the last names of the founders. It originally started building engines for IndyCars. They received financial support from IndyCar team owner and builder Roger Penske. \nThe Daimler-Benz company purchased Chevrolet's 25% share of Ilmor in 1993. In 2002 Daimler AG increased its share to 55% and renamed the company Mercedes-Ilmor. In 2005 Daimler became the sole owner of Ilmor and renamed the company Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines Ltd.\nOne division of the company was called Special Projects. Since 2003, Special Projects had been building Honda's Indy Racing League engines. In 2005, Special Projects split from Mercedes-Ilmor and became a separate company named Ilmor Engineering Ltd. Ilmor Engineering is owned by Mario Illien and Roger Penske. This new company is totally independent of Mercedes-Benz.\nHistory.\nIn Ilmor entered Formula One as an engine supplier. They supplied engines to the Leyton House team. Leyton House was formerly known as March. In 1992, Leyton House changed its name back to March and continued using Ilmor engines. \nIlmor also supplied engines to the Tyrrell team in . Powered by an Ilmor V10, Tyrrell scored 8 points, and March 3 points in the Formula One Championship.\nIlmor had developed a good name in F1. When the Sauber sportscar-team and Mercedes-Benz were planning to enter Formula One together, they made a deal with Ilmor. However, Ilmor deceided not to put the slogan \"Concept by Mercedes-Benz\" on the engines. Since the engines were officially called Ilmor, Mercedes backed out of the project with Ilmor. \nAfter an unexpectedly fast performance in , Sauber convinced Mercedes to join officially in 1994. In Ilmor also supplied the new Pacific GP team of Keith Wiggins with the old 1993 version of the engines. Pacific only managed to qualify seven times in thirty-two tries. The Ilmor engine was not the cause of this poor performance.\nIlmor became the engine partner to McLaren in . The partnership received its first win at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix. Mika H\u00e4kkinen won the driver's championships in the and seasons. The McLaren team won the constructor's championship in . After not winning a single race in the season, McLaren bounced back and won the driver's championship in season with Lewis Hamilton.\nIn 2001 Paul Morgan was killed while landing his vintage (antique) plane at Sywell Aerodrome, Northamptonshire. This led to Mercedes-Benz increasing their financial involvement in Ilmor, and renamed the company Mercedes-Ilmor Ltd."}

This means that they are legally in control over their own actions and decisions, and their parents are no longer responsible for them. When used this way, the word \"majority\" means having the full number of years to be an adult. The opposite is \"minority\", which means being a minor or child. The law in a given place may never actually use the words \"age of majority\" when deciding when people become adults. The age of majority is a legally fixed age and idea of adulthood which is different in different places. It may not match the actual maturity of a person's body or mind. The age of majority is 17 in the vast majority of jurisdictions, but ages as low as 15 and as high as 21 exist in some. \nOverview.\nOnce a person reaches the age of majority, there are some things they can do that they could not do before. These may include buying stocks, voting, buying or drinking alcohol, driving cars on public roads, and marrying without having to ask for permission. The ages that these things can be done are different depending on where the person lives.\nEven after a person reaches the age of majority, there may be other age-based rules that they still have to follow, such as the right to stand for office in elections or become a judge. For example, the youngest a person is allowed to purchase alcohol is 21 in all U.S. states even though the age of majority is 17 in most states.

A complete individual would be 34\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) and weigh only 110 g (3.9\u00a0oz), making it the smallest known feathered dinosaur.\n\"Anchiornis\" fossils have been found in Liaoning, China, dating to the first part of the late Jurassic period, 160 to 161 million years ago.\nDescription.\n\"Anchiornis\" is a small, early troodontid dinosaur with a triangular skull like other troodontids. Also, \"Anchiornis\" had long legs, usually an indication of a strong runner. However, the extensive leg feathers indicate that long legs may be an vestigial trait, because running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their legs. The forelimbs of \"Anchiornis\" were also very long, unusual among troodontids (which tend to be short-armed) but similar to dromaeosaurids and early birds, emphasizing its basal ('primitive') position among dinobirds.\nFeathers.\nWhile the first specimen of \"Anchiornis,\" found in the 2000s, preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, the well-preserved second specimen showed nearly complete feather preservation, allowing researchers to identify the structure of the feathers and how they were distributed.\nAs in other early birds, such as \"Microraptor\", \"Anchiornis\" had large wings, made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand (as in modern birds) as well as flight feathers on the hind legs, forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings. The forewing of \"Anchiornis\" was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers. Unlike \"Microraptor\", the primary feathers in \"Anchiornis\" were about as long as the secondaries and formed a more rounded wing, with curved but symmetrical central vanes, a small and thin relative size, and rounded tips, all indicating poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relative. In \"Microraptor\" and \"Archaeopteryx\", the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear long, narrow, and pointed. However, in \"Anchiornis\", the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.\nThe hind wings of \"Anchiornis\" were also shorter than those of \"Microraptor\", and were made up of 12\u201313 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10\u201311 to the metatarsus (upper foot). Also unlike \"Microraptor\", the hind wing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones. Unlike any other known Mesozoic dinosaur, the feet of \"Anchiornis\" (except for the claws) were completely covered in feathers (much shorter than the ones making up the hind wing).\nTwo types of simpler, downy (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in \"Sinornithosaurus\". Long downy feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs,and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices).\nColour.\nIn 2010, a team examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well-preserved \"Anchiornis\" specimen to survey the distribution of melanosomes, the pigment cells that give feathers their colour. By studying the melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the colours and patterning present on \"Anchiornis\" when it was alive. Though this technique had been used before, \"Anchiornis\" became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life colouration was known.\nMost of the body feathers of \"Anchiornis\" were grey and black. The crown of head feathers was mainly reddish with a grey base and front, and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The fore and hind wing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were grey, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with grey or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were grey other than the long hind wing feathers, and the feet and toes were black.\nLike many modern birds, \"Anchiornis\" exhibited a complex pattern of coloration with different colours in speckled patterns across the body and wings, or \"within- and among-feather plumage coloration\". In modern birds, such colour patterning is used in communication and display, either to members of the same species (e.g. for mating or territorial threat display) or to threaten and warn off competing or predatory species.\nPalaeobiology.\n\"Anchiornis\" is notable for its long forelimbs, which were 80% of the total length of the hind limbs. This is similar to \"Archaeopteryx\"; long forelimbs are necessary for flight. \"Anchiornis\" also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods. The authors first thought that \"Anchiornis\" could fly or glide. However, further finds showed that the wings of \"Anchiornis\", while well-developed, were short when compared to later species like \"Microraptor\", with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded, symmetrical tips, unlike the pointed, aerodynamically proportioned feathers of \"Microraptor\". So the animal could glide, but probably not fly.\n\"Anchiornis\" has long hind legs, suggesting a fast-running lifestyle. However, the legs and even feet and toes of \"Anchiornis\" were covered in feathers, making it unlikely that \"Anchiornis\" was a capable ground runner. A tree-based glider is the probable life-style."}

The U-shape of the lock allows for a wide variety of uses. Typically the padlock is used to lock two things together, for example, a door and its frame, two or more chains, or a chain and a fixed object. Padlocks are not recommended for high-security applications because the shackle is easily cut with a bolt cutter or hacksaw. Some newer padlocks have hardened boron alloy shackles or shrouded (hidden or covered) shackles to make them more difficult to cut.\nConstruction.\nThe combination padlock is usually made with a metal \"can\" with three tumblers inside connected to a dial on the front. The mechanism is very similar to that used in safes. When the correct combination is entered, the notches on the tumblers line up and allow a latch to fall into the notches, releasing the shackle. Combination locks of this type are not recommended for outdoor use because they can fill up with rain water which causes them to rust. The laminated padlock is constructed from a series of metal plates that are riveted together. \nThe shackle of most padlocks is made from hardened steel, although more expensive padlocks may have boron alloy steels to make them more difficult to cut.

It began around the late 18th century, after the Industrial Revolution. A key work was Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\", 1776.\nMarket economics has been widely used because of its efficiency (ability to work well). However, it has also been criticized for its selfishness and the difference between the rich and poor. In the real world, market economies are not purely market economies, as societies and governments control them in some ways instead of market forces. The expression \"free-market economy\" is sometimes used as the same as market economy. Nobel Prize in Economics winner Ludwig von Mises said that a market economy is still a market economy even if the government joins in pricing.\nIn a market economy, the following will be true:\nSometimes, market economy does not work as expected, the following may be observed:"}

She grew up in the United States where she became famous as a model and singer. Ver\u00f3nica appeared on Hispanic Univision, TV commercials, FHM magazines and calendar, and music videos. She works with the USO.\nEarly life.\nMayra Ver\u00f3nica was born in Havana, Cuba on 20 August 1980. Sometimes her birth date appears as 20 August 1980 or 20 August 1983. \"Celebrity Birthday\" lists her as 32\u00a0years old (July 2010), born in 1977.\nIn 1984, she came to the US with her mother, Mayra Rodriguez. They left behind the rest of her family\u2013 her father Arturo Aruca, and sister Giselle Guzman. Her father came to the US a year later and reunited with Veronica and her mother, while her sister was unable to meet them until 13 years later. Ver\u00f3nica spoke about her difficult childhood. She grew up with little money and food was sometimes scarce.\nVer\u00f3nica was a good student. She learned ballet with help from paying students from her school who could afford the training. In junior high school, her now famous curves developed. She said it made ballet difficult, but boys liked it. Her first boyfriend at the age of 15 was an artist of the same age who often painted her in little or no clothing.\nVer\u00f3nica attended Florida International University where she studied psychology and theater.\nWork.\nModeling.\nAfter joining a local beauty and becoming Miss Miami, she met a photographer who took pictures for the event. The photographer invited her to his studio for free photo sessions. Mayra's first modeling job led to another job as a reporter for a local TV celebrity news show. She had no reporting experience, but she was a competent reporter.\nShe was promoted to hostess for the show, where she interviewed Donald Trump, Ivana Trump, Oscar de la Renta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis Rodman, Hugh Hefner, Marc Anthony, and many more. Ver\u00f3nica continued actress training in New York.\nVer\u00f3nica obtained a made-for-TV movie role called \"The Suitor\". She also worked in commercials for Nike, L'Or\u00e9al, Ford, Colgate, Burger King, and Coca-Cola. When Univision started a new TV talk show, they asked her to be their model and co-host, but there was one catch. Due to her ample curves, her last appearance on screen for the day would show her backside on camera before she turned to face the camera. Ver\u00f3nica did it gladly. Once the show aired, the model with the great backside became the talk of Latinos everywhere. Eventually her fame spread through North America.\nCover girl.\nVeronica appeared in \"FHM\" magazine (\"For Him Magazine\"), and also on the cover of the FHM book, which included top sex symbols such as Pamela Anderson, Eva Longoria, and Carmen Electra. Ver\u00f3nica appeared on more than 100 magazine covers. Her web site became very popular and FHM received many letters requesting that she appear again.\nThe US Marines voted Ver\u00f3nica their favorite girl. When soldiers stationed in Iraq sent emails asking for her posters and calendars, Ver\u00f3nica's managers sent the soldiers 5000 posters. The USO asked her to tour with US soldiers in Iraq.\nUSO tour.\nThe Thanksgiving USO tour included General James Cartwright, actor Wilmer Valderrama, and comedian Russell Peters. They traveled 6 places in 6 days (Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany, Turkey, Africa, and Greenland). The troops' appreciation was . Although Veronica had decided not to do more calendars, she changed her mind and decided to do one in 2008, dedicating proceeds to the Wounded Warrior Project.\nUpon her return from the tour, fans described Ver\u00f3nica as a \"modern day Betty Grable\". Ver\u00f3nica continued touring with the USO and became an official .\nIn 2009, the New York Stock Exchange asked Ver\u00f3nica to ring the bell for the Fourth of July celebration. Ver\u00f3nica promoted organizations for which she advocates, the USO and UNICEF, and brought them to the bell ringing ceremony.\nMusic.\nVengo con To.\nDuring her time with the Univision TV Network, Veronica met top music producers who worked with her on her first music album. It was titled \"Vengo Con To\"' (I'm coming at you with everything). It was a popular time for music and Ver\u00f3nica's album included as its first single \"Vengo Con To\". The song soared to number 1 in New York and made top 40 on \"Billboard\". The video was banned from Latin television because her curves appeared too much for TV.\nEurope did not seem to mind and Mayra signed a contract with a German company for the release of the album in Europe. The album's popularity brought Ver\u00f3nica a deal with Motown, which put out a second single from the album titled \"Mamma Mia\" which performed well on radio.\nA third single, \"Es Tan Dificil Olvidarte\", dedicated to the soldiers who died, put Ver\u00f3nica in the top 10 on the pop contemporary charts.

It is a small maniraptoran dinosaur from the Middle or Upper Jurassic age Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia, China (perhaps 160 to 168 million years ago).\nStructure.\nIt is known from a well preserved partial skeleton that includes four long feathers on the tail, composed of a central rachis and vanes. However, unlike in modern-style tail feathers, the vanes were not branched but made up of a single ribbon-like sheet. \"Epidexipteryx\" also preserved a covering of simpler body feathers. They are unique in that some appear to arise from a \"membranous structure\".\nIn all, the skeleton of \"Epidexipteryx hui\" measures 25 centimeters (10\u00a0inches) in length (44.5\u00a0cm or 17.5 in including the incomplete tail feathers), and the authors estimated a weight of 164\u00a0grams, smaller than most other early dinobirds.\nThe skull of \"Epidexipteryx\" is also unique in a number of features. It had teeth only in the front of the jaws, with unusually long front teeth angled forward, a feature only seen in \"Masiakasaurus\" among other theropods. The tail of \"Epidexipteryx\" bore unusual vertebrae towards the tip which resembled the feather-anchoring pygostyle of modern birds and some oviraptors.\nDespite its close relationship to avialan birds, \"Epidexipteryx\" appears to have lacked wing feathers, and so it could not fly. Zhang \"et al.\" suggest that unless \"Epidexipteryx\" evolved from flying ancestors and subsequently lost its wings, this may indicate that advanced display feathers on the tail may have predated flying or gliding flight.\nDating.\nThere is uncertainty about the age of the Daohugou Beds in which this fossil was found. Various papers have placed the fossils here anywhere from the Middle Jurassic (169 million years ago) to the Lower Cretaceous (122 ma). The age of this formation has implications for the relationship between similar dinosaurs, as well as for the origin of birds in general. A Middle Jurassic age would mean that the bird-like dinosaurs in the Daohugou beds are older than the 'first bird', \"Archaeopteryx\", which was late Jurassic in age. Until this question is decided, the significance of \"Epidexipteryx\" (and other early dinobirds from that area) is not clear."}

It is now one of the international standard ballroom dances. All ballroom dance competitions controlled by the World Dance Council include the Foxtrot.\nHistory.\nAll the standard ballroom dances had their origins abroad, but were adapted and modified by English dancers into their modern style. The Waltz came from Germany around 1810. The Tango came from Argentina. The Foxtrot and Quickstep were greatly influenced by American music.\nInfluences from America.\nThe Boston.\nAn American dance called the Boston arrived in England about 1903. This had fairly slow, gliding steps. It is a characteristic of the Foxtrot that in the basic steps, unlike the other dances, the feet slide past each other rather than coming together. The Boston seems to have been the first dance to move the feet in this way. The Boston also was the first ballroom dance to be done with feet parallel (rather than turned out, as in ballet).\nThe Boston, like much else, was finished off by the First World War. Crowded dance floors in wartime left no room for it, and new musical imports arrived from America.\nRagtime.\nRagtime and jazz came to Europe, and were great sensations. Both the music, and the many 'craze' dances contributed. After the war the big bands of Paul Whiteman took centre stage. He played 'arranger's jazz', meaning, the band played from charts rather than by ear. Whiteman's bands were hugely successful (there were several). \nThe craze dances.\n\"The decade between 1910 and 1920\", said one writer, \"was the period in which America went dance mad\".p369 \"From 1912 through 1914\", said another, \"over one hundred new dances found their way in and out of our fashionable ballrooms\".p76\nThese are a few examples: The Shimmy, The Grind, The Turkey Trot, The Bunny Hug, The Texas Tommy, The Cakewalk... Almost all these dances originated in the black community in the United States, and some moved over into white society.p95\nThe English touch.\nDuring the 1920s, English professional dancers and dance teachers set out to find ways of dancing to the new music. In their opinion, what was needed was separate dances for different tempos. So what happened was that the Foxtrot, which had started off as a mid-tempo dance influenced by ragtime, gradually split into two dances, a Slow foxtrot and a quick foxtrot. The difference in tempo allowed the dances to become, in time, different in style as well as music. The Quickstep (as it was soon called) was influenced by the Charleston, and the Slow foxtrot by ideas from the Boston. The syncopation which is still common in the quickstep is an example of ragtime influence on modern dancing.\nThe name.\nWhere did the name 'foxtrot' come from? It is often said that Foxtrot took its name from its inventor, the vaudeville actor Harry Fox; however the exact origins are not clear. The dance was premiered in 1914, quickly catching the eye of the talented husband and wife duo Vernon and Irene Castle, who lent the dance its signature grace and style.\nW.C. Handy's \"Memphis Blues\" was said to be the inspiration for the Foxtrot. The Castles' music director would play the Memphis Blues during breaks from the fast paced Castle Walk and One-step. The Castles were intrigued by the rhythm. They introduced the 'Bunny Hug' in a magazine article. They went abroad and in mid-ocean sent a wireless to the magazine to change the Bunny Hug to the 'Foxtrot'.p226\nFigures.\nFor the International or English style foxtrot\nBasic Figures\nStandard Figures"}

It needs a huge orchestra to play it and a huge choir to sing. Because so many performers are needed it is often called \"Symphony of a Thousand\", but that is not a name that Mahler gave to it.\nMahler worked very hard at it, composing it in quite a short time at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. It was the last of Mahler's works that was to be given its first performance in his lifetime. The symphony was given its first performance in Munich on 12 September 1910.\nSymphonies are usually pieces of music played just by an orchestra, but Beethoven started a tradition of having singing in symphonies: his Ninth Symphony is the famous one with the Ode to Joy in the last movement. Mahler took up this idea of combining singing with symphony. His Symphonies Nos 2, 3, and 4 all have singing in them. The next three are just for orchestra, but in No. 8 he uses singing again.\nSymphony No. 8 is very unusual because he does not have the usual three or four movements with traditional forms such as sonata form. The whole symphony is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a ninth-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, \"Veni creator spiritus\" (\"Come, Creator Spirit\"). Part II is in German. The words come from the closing scene of Goethe's \"Faust\". \nThe two parts have a common idea: the idea of being saved through the power of love. Musically Mahler does this by sharing tunes throughout the symphony. The symphony expresses the confidence of the eternal human spirit.\nFor many years after Mahler\u2019s death it was not often performed. It is, of course, a very expensive symphony to perform because of the vast numbers of musicians needed. It also needs to be performed in a very large concert hall. Today it is played more often. The 100th anniversary of its first performance will be celebrated in July 2010in the opening concert of the BBC Proms is the Royal Albert Hall, London.\nOpinions about the symphony have been divided. Some people did not think the optimism expressed in the music was really convincing. Other people have said it is one of the greatest musical expressions of humanity."}

It is divided into a prologue and three acts. The libretto is by Francesco Maria Piave. The story was based on a play \"Sim\u00f3n Bocanegra\" (1843) by Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez.\n\"Simon Boccanegra\" was first performed at Teatro La Fenice, Venice on 12 March 1857. It was not very successful, and many years later Verdi made a lot of changes to it. He was helped by the writer Arrigo Boito who made changes to the plot. The new version was first performed at La Scala, Milan on 24 March 1881. This is the version that is normally performed today.\nThe story of the opera.\nThe story is supposed to take place in the middle of the 14th century in Genoa. Genoa (in Italian: Genova) is now a town in Italy, but in those days Italy was not yet one country, and Genoa, like Venice, was a small republic, ruled by a Doge (pronounced \u201cDoadz\u201d in English. It is an Italian word meaning \u201cduke\u201d). Until the time of this story the Doge had always been chosen from one of the rich patricians. The ordinary, common people (the plebeians), could not be chosen to be the Doge.\nAt the beginning of the story Fiesco is the Doge of Genoa. He has a daughter Maria. Maria has fallen in love with Simon Boccanegra who is a plebeian, so he would not be important enough to be allowed to marry her, even though he has become a hero because he has fought lots of pirates. Simon and Maria had a child, a young girl. After she was born she was given to an old woman to look after, but one day the old woman died and the small child wandered off alone. She was found wandering by the sea shore by Count Grimaldi who took her and looked after her as if she were his own child.\nNo one knows what has happened to the child. Count Grimaldi does not know who she is. He thinks she is an orphan.\nPrologue.\nWhen the opera begins, Paolo, the leader of the Plebeian party, persuades Pietro to encourage the plebeians to vote for Simon Boccanegra as the new doge of Genoa. Boccanegra arrives and agrees that he would be doge if he were chosen. Simon thinks this would make Fiesco allow him to marry Maria. For the past three months Fiesco has locked his daughter in the palace because she had had a child with Simon.\nMaria dies (we never see her in the opera). Fiesco now laments the death of his daughter. Simon begs Fiesco to forgive him. Fiesco does not tell him Maria has just died. He promises to forgive him only if Simon lets him have his granddaughter. Simon explains he cannot because the child has disappeared. He goes into Maria\u2019s room and finds she is dead. The people sing happily because Simon is the new Doge.\nAct 1.\nThe story of Act I takes place 25 years later. Simon is still the Doge. He has sent many of his enemies into exile and taken away their property. Count Grimaldi is one of the people who has been exiled. In the Grimaldi castle, Fiesco is calling himself Andrea Grimaldi so that people do not know who he is. He is plotting with Simon\u2019s enemies to overthrow him. He does not know that his granddaughter (Simon\u2019s daughter) is the young lady called Amelia Grimaldi who is living in the castle.\nAt the beginning of Act I we see Amelia singing a beautiful song about the morning and the sea and the stars. She has a lover, Gabriele Adorno. When he arrives she warns him of the dangers of political plotting. The news is brought that the Doge is coming. Amelia is worried that the Doge will make her marry Paolo, so she asks Gabriele to ask Andrea (who is actually Fiesco) immediately for permission for them to marry. Fiesco agrees. He tells Gabriele that she was a poor orphan who had been found (he does not realize that it is his granddaughter). Gabriele says that he does not care about that, so Fiesco blesses the marriage.\nSimon enters. He tells her that Count Grimaldi is forgiven and can return home. He asks her whether she would like to marry Paolo, but she refuses. She tells him that she is an orphan and she shows him a locket with a picture of her mother. Simon realizes that Amelia is his long-lost daughter. They are very happy to have found one another. When Paolo enters, Simon tells him he cannot marry her. Paolo is furious and decides to kidnap Amelia.\nIn the next scene we see Simon surrounded by the plebeian and patrician members of his Council. They are discussing whether they should make peace with the republic of Venice. Suddenly a crowd enters shouting for death to Simon. They are chasing Gabriele. Gabriele confesses that he killed Lorenzino for trying to kidnap Amelia. As Lorenzino lay dying he had said that he had been told by an important person to kidnap her. Adorno guesses that Simon must have ordered the kidnapping. He is about to attack him when Amelia rushes in and stops the fight Simon arrests Gabriele. He realizes that Paolo must be the real kidnapper, and makes everybody (including Paolo) curse him. Simon and his daughter are left alone on stage at the end of the act.\nAct 2.\nPaolo is frightened. He is furious with Simon and decides he must poison him. Fiesco and Gabriele are brought in. He tells Fiesco he can be free if he murders Simon. Fiesco refuses. Just as Fiesco and Gabriele are about to leave, Paolo asks Gabriele whether he knows Amelia is here in the palace having an affair with Simon. Gabriele is furious. When Amelia enters she denies the story. She tells Gabriele she loves him and tries to persuade him to leave, but Simon is coming and Gabriele hides.\nAmelia tells Simon that she would die for Gabriele. Simon agrees to pardon him. He drinks from a poisoned glass of wine, which Paolo had put on the table, and falls asleep. Gabriele tries to kill him, but Amelia stops him. Simon wakes up. He tells Gabriele that Amelia is his daughter. Gabriele begs Simon for forgiveness and promises he will fight for him.\nAct 3.\nThis takes place in a great hall which looks out on the harbour. Fiesco has been set free, but Paolo is condemned to death for leading the uprising against the Doge. Paolo tells Fiesco that he has poisoned Simon. Fiesco goes to Simon, who is now dying (the poison is working slowly). Simon recognizes his old enemy who he thought was dead. He is happy to tell him that Amelia is his long-lost granddaughter. Fiesco feels terribly sad and tells Simon about the poison. Gabriele and Amelia have just got married. They find her father and grandfather are now friends. Simon asks for Gabriele to be the next Doge when he dies. Fiesco goes to the window and announces to the crowd that Gabriele Adorno is now the new Doge and that Simon Boccanegra is dead."}

They erupt when pressure has built up, often at regular intervals. There are about a thousand geysers around the world. About half are in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States.\nCauses.\nGeysers are made in special geological conditions. Only a few places on Earth have these conditions. Because of this, geysers are not very common. One place is the Yellowstone National Park, which is the remains of a gigantic volcano. Another is Iceland, which sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where new Earth's crust is formed.\nGeysers are often near active volcanos. This is because the geyser is caused by magma. Surface water usually goes down to about . There, it mixes with hot rocks. The pressurized water begins to boil. When it is pressured enough, hot water and steam burst out of the geyser.\nForm and function.\nIndividual geysers do not last forever, but \"systems\" of geysers last as long as the geological situation continues. The oldest individual geysers are only a few thousand years old. Geysers are usually near volcanic areas. As the water boils, the pressure increases. This forces hot steam and water to the surface through the geyser. Geysers are usually made because of three things that are around volcanoes.\nMost importantly, the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser become high enough to start boiling the water. Steam bubbles come out of the top of the column. They burst through the geyser's vent. Some water flows or splashes out. This makes the weight of the column of water and the pressure on the water below less. When this pressure is released, the hot water turns into steam.

It is equal to the price of one share of stock, times the number of shares of stock in a public company. Owning stock in a company is owning a part of the company. Market capitalization shows the public opinion of a company's value. The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US$51.2 trillion in January 2007. In May 2008 it rose to US$57.5 trillion, but by September 2008 had dropped to a little more than US$40 trillion. \nValuation.\nMarket capitalization represents the public opinion of the value of a company's equity. A public corporation, including all of its assets, may be bought and sold as stock. These purchases and sales will define the price of the company's share price. Market capitalization is the share price times by the number of shares in issue. This provides a total value for the company's shares and the value the company.\nSome companies have stock that is privately owned, and not publicly traded. Many Stock markets adjust the market cap on the value of the publicly traded part of the company. In this case, market capitalization is based on the publicly traded stocks.\nNote that market capitalization is a market estimate of a company's value. It is based how the public believes the company will perform in the future. There are many things that can affect the stock price. These include economic conditions and mergers and acquisitions.\nCategorization of companies by capitalization.\nIn the past, companies were separated into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. New categories 'micro-cap' and 'nano-cap' have been added. There are general guidelines to know what category a company is in. These guidelines are adjusted over time due to changes in the market and the economy. For example, $1 billion was a large market cap in 1950 but it is not very large now. \nDifferent numbers are used by different stock markets. There is no official definition of the exact cutoffs. They also may be done by percentiles rather than fixed cutoffs.\nRelated measures.\nMarket cap reflects only the \"equity\" value of a company. A more comprehensive measure is enterprise value (EV), which includes debt and other factors.\nInsurance firms use a value called the embedded value (EV)."}

They were famous for developing and promoting dancing in the period of the First World War.\nVernon Castle (2 May 1887 \u2013 15 February 1918) was born William Vernon Blyth in Norwich, Norfolk, England. Irene Castle (17 April 1893 \u2013 25 January 1969) was born Irene Foote, the daughter of a prominent physician in New Rochelle, New York. \nVernon chose 'Castle' as a stage name when he first performed as a comic, because his sister (also on the stage) already used the family name, Blyth. He had already taken the name before Irene met him in 1910.p33\nRise to fame.\nVernon was initially trained to become a civil engineer. He moved to New York in 1906. There he became established as a comic actor and conjuror.\nIrene studied dancing and performed in several amateur theatricals before meeting Vernon in 1910. The next year, over her father\u2019s objections, the two were married. The English-born Vernon had already established himself as a dancer in comedic roles. His specialty was playing a gentleman drunk, who elegantly fell about the stage while trying to hide his condition. \nAfter their marriage, Irene joined Vernon in The Hen-Pecks (1911), a production in which he was a featured player. The two then travelled together to Paris to perform in a dance revue. The show closed quickly, but the couple were hired as a dance act by the Caf\u00e9 de Paris. Performing the latest American dances, the Castles were soon the rage of Parisian society. They introduced American ragtime dances, such as the Turkey Trot and the Grizzly Bear.\nWhen the Castles returned to the U.S. in 1912, their success was repeated on a far wider scale. Making their New York debut at a branch of the Cafe de Paris, the duo were soon in demand on stage, in vaudeville and in motion pictures. In 1914, the couple opened a dancing school in New York called \"Castle House\", a nightclub called \"Castles by the Sea\" on the Boardwalk in Long Beach New York, and a restaurant, the \"Sans Souci\".\nFilm and fashion.\nIn addition to cabaret, the Castles also became staples of Broadway. The Castles' greatest success was on Broadway, in Irving Berlin's debut musical \"Watch Your Step\" (1914). In this extravaganza, the couple refined and popularized the Foxtrot, which vaudeville comedian Harry Fox may have invented. After its New York run, \"Watch Your Step\" toured through 1916.\nThe Castles helped remove the stigma of vulgarity from close dancing. The Castles\u2019 performances, often set to ragtime and jazz rhythms, also popularized African-American music among well-heeled whites. Irene\u2019s fashion sense, too, started national trends. Her elegant, yet simple, flowing gowns were often featured in fashion magazines. She also introduced American women to the bob\u2014the short hairstyle favored by flappers in the 1920s (see also Louise Brooks).\nThe Castles appeared in a newsreel called \"Social and Theatrical Dancing\" in 1914 and wrote a bestselling instructional book, \"Modern Dancing\", later the same year. The pair also starred in a feature film called \"The Whirl of Life\" (1915), which was well-received by critics and public alike. As the couple's celebrity increased in the mid-1910s, Irene Castle became a major fashion trendsetter, with her bobbed hair and shorter skirts. Her chic wardrobe was supplied almost exclusively by the couturi\u00e8re 'Lucile', (Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon) but Irene also designed some of her clothes herself. \nThe slim, elegant Castles were trendsetters in many ways: they travelled with a black orchestra, had an openly lesbian manager, and were animal rights advocates long before it became a public issue.\nThe Castles endorsed Victor Records and Victrolas. They issued records by the Castle House Orchestra, led by James Reese Europe \u2013\u2013 a pioneering figure in Black music. They also lent their names to advertising for other products, from cigars and cosmetics to shoes and hats. They were, in short, personalities of the modern kind, who had a gift for self-publicity. They were as famous as any film stars of the day.\nWorld War I: Vernon's death.\nVernon returned to the UK to become a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Flying over the Western Front he shot down two aircraft and was awarded the French Croix de Guerre in 1917. He was posted to Canada to train new pilots, and then promoted to Captain and posted to the US to train American pilots. \nWhile flying at Benbrook Field, near Fort Worth, Texas, he took emergency action shortly after take off to avoid another aircraft. His plane stalled, and he was unable to recover control. Vernon was the only casualty. Fatally injured, he died soon after the crash, on . Irene paid tribute to Vernon in her memoir \"My Husband\", 1919.\nLife without Vernon.\nIrene starred solo in about a dozen silent movies between 1917 and 1924 and appeared in several stage productions before retiring from show business. She married three more times \u2013\u2013 to Robert Treman, Frederic McLaughlin, and George Enzinger. \nIn 1939, her life with Vernon was turned into a movie, \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle\", produced by RKO and starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Irene served as a technical advisor on the movie, but clashed with Rogers, who refused to short bob or darken her hair. Irene also objected to white actor Walter Brennan playing their servant: \"Walter was BLACK\".\nFor the rest of her life, Irene was a staunch animal-rights activist, ultimately founding the Illinois animal shelter \"Orphans of the Storm\", which is still active. \nIrene died . Vernon and Irene Castle are interred together in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. There is a large monument to Vernon Castle near the site of his crash in Benbrook, Texas."}

The dance is based on the way matadors perform in the ring.\nDance.\nIn the dance, the man takes the part of the matador, and the woman takes the part of the man's cape (\"not\" the bull!). The man's stance (the way he stands) should be proud, and when he has a free arm it should be held slightly bent, rather as matadors do. The photograph of the ice dancers gives a perfect example of what dancers should aim for in this style.\nThe paso doble is one of the five International Latin ballroom dances. It gives a very good contrast in style with the four other dances. Although so Spanish in style and origin, the dance techniques were first developed in Paris. Later, in mid 20th century London, the Latin and American dances took on their present form.\nMusic.\nThe music is scored in 2/4 time. It is a march-like type of music, and as a dance it is a two-step (\"paso doble\" = two-step). It is played at about 60/62 bars (measures) a minute for dancers.\nThe most famous piece of paso doble music is the \"Espa\u00f1a Ca\u00f1\u00ed\" or \"Spanish Gypsy Dance\". A sample of \"La Gracia de Dios\" gives an idea of the rhythm."}

When King Minos of Crete was having some sovereignty problems, he asked Poseidon, god of the sea, for an offering to sacrifice to him as a sign as true kingship. So Poseidon sent a snow-white bull straight out of the sea foam. Once the people of Crete saw the bull, they all agreed that it was a sign of true kingship. However, once King Minos saw the bull, he refused to sacrifice the bull, kept it for himself, and sacrificed another bull to Poseidon, thus angering him. Poseidon put a curse on Minos\u2019 wife, making her fall in love with the bull. She loved it so much that she wanted to mate with it. Minos called for the help of Daedalus, who built a wooden bull and put Queen Pasiphae inside it, thus calming her anxiety for mating with the bull. She soon became pregnant with half-man, half-bull (also called the Minotaur). \nKing Minos was horrified and asked Daedalus to build some kind of prison to keep the Minotaur from destroying Crete. So Daedalus built a labyrinth that was so complicated that the Minotaur could not get out. Only Daedalus knew the course of the labyrinth. Minos was afraid that Daedalus would tell the route through the labyrinth, and that he would tell that the Minotaur was the son of Minos' wife, he imprisoned Daedalus and his son Icarus, in a high tower. Daedalus made some wings that he strapped to his and Icarus\u2019 arms and together they escaped from the tower. However, Icarus, forgetting his father\u2019s words, flew too close to the sun, and the wax that held the feathers together melted. Icarus fell into the ocean and drowned. Daedalus landed safely on an island, and in grief, he named the sea that he and Icarus had flown across the Icarian Sea. "}

The Pentateuch is often called the Five Books of Moses or the Torah.\nThe Pentateuch tells the story from the Creation of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelite's to enter the land of Canaan. The story is told in three parts. The first part (Genesis 1-11) is about the Creation and the beginning of human beings on earth. The second part (Genesis 12-50) are the stories of the ancestors of the Israelites, mainly Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The third part, beginning with the book of Exodus, describes how the Israelite's left Egypt and the early history of the people of Israel as a nation. It also has many laws about how the Israelite's must build their society. Deuteronomy is mostly Moses's final speech to his people and a summary of the Pentateuch.\nThe Pentateuch is most likely the oldest part of the Bible, however there is speculation that the book of Job could be older due to the similarities of Job to the patriarchal period, ie counting wealth in flocks and the sacrifices being performed by the patriarch of the household rather than a priest. Scholars do not know exactly when these books were written however many place Moses at between 1,600 - 1,450 BC. The earliest parts may have been written more than 1,000 years before the final parts according to the Julius Wellhausen 4 JEDP theory. However this theory is based on the idea that the Pentateuch is a disjointed work and has received due criticism. Modern archaeological discoveries suggest that some of the oldest stories in Genesis may date back three thousand years."}

It is danced to the fastest tempo of the ballroom dances.\nThe Quickstep developed in the 1920s from a combination of the Foxtrot, the Charleston, and other dances. The dance is English in origin, and was standardized in 1927. Although it came from the Foxtrot, the Quickstep now is quite separate. Unlike the modern Foxtrot, the feet often close and syncopated (split-beat) steps occur often. Three characteristic dance figures of the Quickstep are the \"chass\u00e9s\", where the feet come together, the \"quarter turns\", and the \"lock step\".p126\nThis dance became a very dynamic one with a lot of movement on the dance floor, with many advanced patterns including hops, runs, quick steps with a lot of momentum, and rotation. The tempo of Quickstep dance is rather brisk as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music which was fast-paced compared to other dance music.\nToday the complexity of Quickstep as done by competition dancers has increased. They use more syncopated steps. While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with \"quick\" (one beat) and \"slow\" (two beats) steps, many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats, such as \"quick-and-quick-and-quick, quick, slow\", with there being further steps on the 'and's.

For beginners it is a simple dance compared to some others. At competitive level it is much more demanding. It features whisks, chass\u00e9s, spins, hesitations, drags, and split-beat steps, many of which have been copied in other dances. The first 'advanced' figure to be invented was the double reverse spin, by Maxwell Stewart in the 1924 World Championship.p42 Nowadays it is taught at the silver medal stage."}

Students of different abilities (low, middle, and high) are assigned to different \"tracks\" of courses and programs (vocational, general, college-bound, honors, and AP). Tracking is the term given to this process, and while some teachers believe that tracking makes instruction more manageable, others believe that it is a terribly flawed system. Once a student is placed, it may be very difficult to move up from one track to another. The placements may reflect racism, classism, or sexism. Many educators charge that the United States relies more on tracking than any other nation in the world. Most schools today work hard to avoid using the term \"tracking.\" Middle and high schools are taking their cue from elementary schools, where \"ability grouping\" has been in favor. Ability grouping sorts students based on capability, but the groupings may well vary by subject. While tracks suggest permanence, ability grouping is more transitory. One year, a student might find herself in a high-ability math group and a low-ability English group. The following year, that same student might be reassigned to a new set of groups. School tracking is a reality functioning under an assumed identity called ability grouping.\nOther.\nBesides tracking, another way to deal with diversity is to integrate students of different ability levels together in small working groups. Cooperative learning gives students a sense of pride for both their individual performance and that of the group. The students begin to take responsibility for their learning rather than on the teacher. Cooperative learning allows higher achievement in many students and has eased tensions in multicultural classrooms as students learn to work together."}

Pierre was a professional dancer and dance teacher; he was a Fellow, Examiner and committee member of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) and a Member of the Official Board of Ballroom Dancing (OBBD).\nPierre was the main person responsible for introducing the Latin American dances to England. He set them up for use in competitions and in social dance. The system he and his colleagues developed became the basis for all Latin American competitions held under the World Dance Council (WDC).\nAfter World War I ended in 1918 he started on a career as a professional ballroom dancer in London. Although he spent the rest of his life resident in London, Pierre never gave up his French citizenship.\nLatin dance in England.\nThe rhythms which make Latin American dance popular were brought to Britain between the two World Wars. Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style. In Latin dances, his repertoire first consisted of the Argentine tango, the Paso doble and the Samba.\nBy the 1930s Pierre had moved more towards the Latin American dances, and in 1934 his full-page trade adverts featured the rumba. The studio stayed open all through World War II, and was a popular meeting place for the Free French fighters on leave in London. Pierre's studio always played authentic music for its LA dance instruction.\nThe rumba arrives in London.\nOriginally, Pierre had visited Paris to find out how their dancers and teachers dealt with the rumba. But after the war, in 1947, Pierre visited Cuba, where he discovered to his surprise that the Cubans danced it differently. When he was there, he danced at the \"acadamias\" every night. After this he returned to London determined to teach the Cuban rumba, \"sistema cubano\". To this end, Pierre wrote the first account of his ideas on the rumba as a dance.\nOne of the characteristics of Cuban dance to the \"Son\", and other similar rhythms, was, and still is, their method of taking three steps to four beats of music (whether 2/4 or 4/4). The Cuban rumba figure starts on beat 2, counting (pause) 2, 3, 4-1 as (pause) quick, quick, slow with the hip settling over the standing foot on 4-1. \nAll social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba. In general, steps are kept compact and the dance is without any rise and fall. The argument in favour of this method was authenticity, and also satisfaction at the dance effect the Cuban style achieved. \nThe Latin and American section of the ISTD Ballroom Branch was formed in 1947 by Monsieur Pierre as Chairman. The syllabus finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since. This work naturally included the Samba, Paso doble and Jive as well. After further visits to Cuba in the early 1950s, when Doris Lavelle and James Arnell accompanied Pierre, the Cha-cha-cha was added to make the five Latin American dances which are still the basis of teaching and competition today.\nOn Pierre's death in 1963, his colleague Doris Nichols commented:\n\"The Latin American dancing world was so influenced, fostered and built up by him that the names of 'Pierre' and 'Latin American' became virtually synonymous\"."}

In the UK, health and safety legislation is made by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974.\nIn the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 created both the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\nNo one can ever be said to be absolutely safe, and employers have to fill in \u201crisk assessments\u201d (UK) or \u201chazard assessments\u201d (USA) to show they have done everything they can to make things safe."}

The 7th animated movie in the Disney animated features canon, it shows an adventure through parts of Latin America, combining live-action and animation. This is the second of the Disney package movies of the 1940s.\nThe movie is made up as a series of self-contained segments, strung together by the device of Donald Duck opening birthday gifts from his Latin American friends. Several Latin American stars of the movie's time appear, including singers Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen Miranda) and Dora Luz, as well as dancer Carmen Molina. It again starred Donald Duck, who in the course of the movie is joined by old friend Jos\u00e9 Carioca, the cigar-smoking parrot from \"Saludos Amigos\" (1943) representing Brazil, and later makes a new friend, a rooster, Panchito Pistoles, representing Mexico.\nThe music of the Mexican part of the movie was written by Mexican composer Manuel Esperon, who wrote the score for over 540 Mexican movies in the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. Walt Disney, after having seen his success in the Mexican movie industry, called him personally to ask him to participate in the movie. The main song for the Mexican part is \"Ay Jalisco, No Te Rajes!\", one of Esperon's most famous songs. The movie received two Academy Award nominations for Original Music Score and Best Sound.\nPlot.\nIt is Donald Duck's birthday. He receives three presents. The first present is a movie projector, which shows him a documentary on birds. The next present is a book given to Donald by Jose Carioca himself. This book takes them to Bahia. The third present is a pi\u00f1ata given to Donald by Panchito Pistoles. In the pi\u00f1ata, there are many surprises. The celebration ends with Donald Duck being fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a bull (the firecrackers are lit by Jose with his cigar).\nThroughout the movie, we see a voiceless character called the Aracuan Bird at random moments. He usually bothers everyone, sometimes stealing Jose's cigar. His most famous gag is when he re-routes the train by drawing new tracks. He returns three years later in Disney's \"Melody Time\"."}

Steps are counted 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4, with 3 &amp; 4 as the chass\u00e9.\nHistory.\nAmerican soldiers brought Lindy Hop/Jitterbug to Europe around 1942, where this dance quickly became popular among the young. In the United States the term 'Swing' became the most common word used to describe the dance. In the UK variations in technique led to styles such as Boogie-Woogie and Swing Boogie, with 'Jive' gradually emerging as the generic term.\nAfter the war, the boogie became the dominant form for popular music. It was, however, never far from criticism as a foreign, vulgar dance. The famous ballroom dancing guru, Alex Moore, said that he had \"never seen anything uglier\". English instructors developed the elegant and lively ballroom Jive, danced to slightly slower music. In 1968 it was adopted as the fifth Latin dance in International competitions.

It is likely that \"dirge\" also came from the old expression \"Dirige, Domine, Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam\" (\"Direct my way in your sight, O Lord my God\"). \"Dirge\", meaning \"to direct\", is the same as a \"dirigible\" (\"steerable\") airship. These two words became connected in 1937 because of the Hindenburg disaster."}

They are usually delivered at the end of a worship service. Roman Catholics have many more benedictions, usually with many candles (even poor churches have at least ten), than Protestants, who only have a few simple benedictions. A kind of benediction that is often done in both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches is for the worship leader to raise his hands and say the Biblical Priestly Blessing (). This was made popular by Martin Luther in his Deutsche Messe (German Mass). It is a tradition in most Lutheran Churches. F. Scott Fitzgerald also wrote a short story called \"Benediction\" in 1920."}

An example of this is homosexuality. \nThe manual was developed from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a manual written by the US Army.

The artist's own body, face, and presence is needed for the performance.\nPerformance art differs from the plastic arts, which use materials such as clay, metal or paint which can be moulded or transformed. A plastic art produces some physical art object. The term 'performing arts' first appeared in the English language in the year 1711.\nTypes of performing arts.\nPerforming arts include the dance, music, opera, drama, magic, oratory and circus arts.\nArtists who participate in performing arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, comedians, dancers, magicians, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as songwriting and stagecraft.\nPerformers often adapt their appearance, such as with costumes and stage makeup, etc.\nThere is also a specialized form of fine art in which the artists \"perform\" their work live to an audience. This is called performance art. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of props. Dance was often referred to as a \"plastic art\" during the Modern dance era.\nMusic.\nMusic focuses on three career paths, music performance, music education, and musicology (theory, history, etc.). Students learn to play musical instrument, but also study music theory, musicology, history of music and musical composition. In the arts tradition, music is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.\nDrama.\nDrama (Greek 'to do', 'seeing place') is the branch of the performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience. It uses speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle\u2014indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style of plays, theatre takes such forms as musicals, opera, ballet, illusion, mime, Indian dance, kabuki, mummers' plays, stand-up comedy, pantomime, and non-conventional or arthouse theatre.\nDance.\nDance (from Old French \"dancier\") generally refers to human movement either used as a form of expression or in a social, spiritual or performance setting.\n'Dance' is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (\"the leaves danced in the wind\"), and certain music genres.\nChoreography is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.\nThe definition of what is dance depends on society, and ranges from folk dance to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet. In sports, rhythmic gymnastics, figure skating, ice dancing and synchronized swimming are \"dance\" disciplines. Some martial arts have dance-like moves.\nHistory of Western performing arts.\nStarting in the 6th century BC, the first recorded performing art began in Ancient Greece, ushered in by the tragic poets such as Aeschylus and Sophocles. These poets wrote plays which, in some cases, incorporated dance (see Euripides). Aristophanes is noted for his satyrical comedies (5th century BC).\nBy the 6th century AD, the Western performing arts died out as the Dark Ages began. Between the 9th century and 14th century, performing art in the West was limited to religious historical enactments and morality plays, organized by the Church in celebration of holy days and other important events."}

Roussel spent seven years as a midshipman. He only turned to music as an adult. But he then became one of the most important composers of the years between the two world wars. His earlier music came from the impressionism of Debussy and Ravel. He turned more towards neoclassicism with his later music.\nPersonal life.\nAlbert Roussel was born in Tourcoing (\"Nord\" \"department\" of France). HIs earliest interest was not music. It was mathematics. He spent some time in the French Navy. In 1889 and 1890 he served on the crew of the frigate \"Iphig\u00e9nie\". These travels were significant to his later career as a composer. This is because many of his musical works would reflect his interest in far-off and interesting places.\nAfter Roussel left the Navy in 1894, he began to study music with Eug\u00e8ne Gigout. He continued his studies until 1908 at the Schola Cantorum (one of his teachers there was Vincent d'Indy). While he studied, he would also teach at the Schola. His fellow students were Erik Satie and the young Edgard Var\u00e8se.\nDuring World War I, he served as an ambulance driver on the Western Front. After the war, he bought a summer house in Normandy. This is where he gave most of his time to composing music.\nRoussel was a classicist. Some of his first works are very much like impressionism. But he soon found a style fit just for him. This style had a strong rhythmic sound.\nThe Schola Cantorum left a mark on Roussel's mature writing. Compared with the style of other French composers like Gabriel Faur\u00e9 or Claude Debussy, Roussel's orchestration is rather powerful and heavy.\nRoussel also liked jazz. He wrote a piano-vocal composition called \"Jazz dans la nuit\". This has a lot in common with other jazz-influenced works such as the \"Blues\" second movement of Maurice Ravel's \"Violin Sonata\".\nRoussel's most important pieces include his ballets. They are \"Le festin de l'araign\u00e9e\", \"Bacchus et Ariane\", and \"Aeneas\". Among his other works are four symphonies (the Third is the most often played), a piano concerto, a concertino for cello and orchestra, a psalm setting for chorus and orchestra, music for the theater, solo piano music, and songs. He died in the town of Royan in western France in 1937. That is the same year that his countrymen Ravel, Charles-Marie Widor, and Gabriel Piern\u00e9 died.\nArturo Toscanini included the suite from the ballet \"Le festin de l'araign\u00e9e\" in one of his concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Georges Pr\u00eatre recorded this same music with the \"Orchestre National de France\" for EMI in 1984."}

She appeared on \"The Hills\" because she was the friend and roommate of the show's main star, Lauren Conrad.\nDuring \"The Hills\", she started dating Spencer Pratt. She later married him, but the other people on \"The Hills\", especially Conrad, hated Pratt. Because of this, Montag and Pratt became portrayed as \"the villains\" of the series.\nMontag and Pratt were removed from \"The Hills\" in 2010. This was after Pratt had told one of the producers that he would kill him. Pratt was ordered to take anger management classes, but even after that, they would not rehire him and his wife. Montag had also filed charges against \"The Hills\" creator Adam Divello, claiming sexual harassment.\nMusic career.\nMontag started working on her own music album in 2007. In 2009, she performed her song \"Body Language\" on the Miss Universe beauty pageant show in the Bahamas. Her performance was disliked by critics and many other people.\nShe released her debut album in 2010. It was called \"Superficial\" and it sold only 1,000 copies in its first week.

In 2008, they married in Mexico. They married a second time in California. Only the second time was legal.\nIn July 2010, Montag filed for divorce.

In September they called off the divorce and renewed their vows.\nPlastic surgery.\nMontag has made headlines for her plastic surgery. She has undergone nose correction, chin correction, suction of fat off her hips, many others and best known, a breast enlargement. In 2010, she had ten surgeries in one day, which almost killed her.

It has often been used by women in many cultures. It is often used by brides on their wedding day. It may have religious meaning, or it may be used for pleasure or dance. It is different from a mask because a mask is close-fitting, and often firm or hard, while a veil is soft and may fit loosely.\nVeils as communication.\nVeils are a kind of non-verbal communication. They always have some kind of unspoken message.\nSome kinds of veil include a hood which covers the entire head, like a hijab. The point of covering the head entirely is to cover all parts which have any sexual meaning. A woman's hair is one of her secondary sexual characteristics, and acts (with her face, body and personality) to attract the opposite sex. Some religious groups believe that female sexuality should not be shown in public.\nThe most important part of the head (for the viewer) is the face, because the human face takes part in communication. Covering it says, in effect, 'this person is not available'. That is why it has been used so often by women. Because it is of soft material, the veil may be lifted back over the head or unclipped from one side. This is also a signal. It says 'now I am available'. So brides lift their veil at the point when they are married.\nVeils may be, and often are, partly transparent. This adds ambiguity and mystery to the 'message' it offers the viewer; it is a 'fashion statement'. The raising or dropping of veils is a sign of intimacy: the wearer, who was covered, is now in the open. In an extreme example, the idea of a \"Dance of the Seven Veils\" originates with the 1893 English translation of Oscar Wilde's 1891 French play Salome in the stage direction."}

The males are about 20% smaller than the females.\nIn the last few decades, the species has spread to many other countries, mainly through the transport of goods. Many communities see this species as a pest. Unlike other mosquitos, the Asian tiger mosquito associates with humans. Other mosquitos tend to live in wetlands. The Asian tiger mosquito is also active during the day, while most other mosquitos are only active during dusk and dawn.\nThe Asian tiger mosquito can spread several diseases, such as West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, St. Louis encephalitis, dengue fever, and Chikungunya fever,"}

It is 61\u00a0km southeast of Melbourne. In 1997 about 70 per cent of the island was made the French Island National Park. It has also been listed as part of the National Estate. In 2002, the waters on the north coast were made into the French Island Marine National Park.\nEven though it is close to Melbourne, French Island is relatively isolated and undeveloped. There is no water or electricity supply, or medical services on the island. There is one small shop and post office on Tankerton Road about 3\u00a0km from Tankerton Jetty. There is a number of places to stay, including camping, bed and breakfasts, guest houses, and the McLeod Eco Farm which was once a prison.\nHistory.\nAn Australian aboriginal clan, Bunarong Tribe lived and hunted on French Island. The first Europeans to discover the island were the French in April 1802. A group from the ship, \"La Naturaliste\", explored the area naming it \"\u00cele de Fran\u00e7oise\", (French Island).\nIn 1847 the first settlers, William and John Gardner, started farming on the island. In the 1880's, koalas were released on to the island. In the 1890's the government set up several small villages. Farmers began to grow chicory, and about 30 chicory kilns were built.\nOn July 17, 1916 the McLeod Prison Farm opened and continued until 1975. In 1967, the State Electricity Commission (SEC)wanted to build the first nuclear power plant in Australia on French Island\nTankerton Post Office opened on 3\u00a0September 1890 and closed in 1994. It reopened in 2001 under the name French Island. A Fairhaven office was also open from 1911 until 1957.\nNuclear power plant site.\nIn 1967, the SEC told the Lands Department to keep 400 acres of French Island for future construction of a nuclear power plant. The plant, to be built in the 1970's, would generate 350-500MW of electricity. More nuclear power plants would be built in Australia once there was a successful, fully operational plant in Victoria. The SEC also planned to build more brown coal power stations as well.\nDue to the low cost of brown coal in Victoria and pressure from the anti-nuclear movement, the SEC decided not to build a nuclear plant and instead continued to build brown coal plants. These included the Hazelwood Power Station, which was completed in 1971. Nuclear plants were not built in New South Wales, as access to black coal allowed for bigger generators. The declaration of various areas of many Australian states as nuclear free zones was a key factor in the selection of coal plants over nuclear plants.\nAccess.\nThere is easy access to the island by train and ferry. People can take a train from Melbourne to Frankston. From Frankston there is a diesel locomotive service to Stony Point. It is a short walk along the jetty to catch the passenger ferry to Tankerton jetty on French Island. It is also possible to catch a passenger ferry from Cowes on Phillip Island.\nGeography.\nImportant features are Mount Wellington which is 96m in height and the Pinnacles at 66m.\nPeople.\nIn 2006 there were 89 people living on French Island. In 2009,there were five students at the primary school.\nNatural Environment.\nHabitats range from coastal mangroves, swamps, heath, grasslands and blue gum forests. Most koalas on the mainland of Australia suffer from the chlamydia disease. French Island provides the world's most dense and disease free group of koalas. They are often moved to repopulate diseased areas on the mainland. Shelter is provided for more than 100 species of bush orchids, and 260 species of birds. Significant species on the island include: King Quail, the critically endangered Orange-bellied Parrot, Fairy Tern, White-bellied Sea Eagle, Swamp Skink, Long-nosed Potoroo.\nThe island is one of only two places in Victoria where there are no foxes. Because of this, the island has kept a variety of native species which have been devastated by the fox in other areas. However rabbits, feral cats, feral goats, feral pigs, Indian Mynahs and starlings pose a threat to the island's biodiversity.\nTransport.\nAs the only cars used on the island are by residents, the network of more than 40\u00a0km of gravel roads and tracks are quiet and ideal for cycling. The island is generally flat or mildly undulating with the highest point being Mt Wellington (96 m). Bicycles can be hired from the General Store, Macleod Eco Farm and Bayview. There are many walking tracks. Other activities include bushwalking, bird watching, horse riding, cycling, and as a base for deep sea fishing. \nTwo local tour companies, French Island Tours and French Island Eco Tours, can provide bus tours of the island.\nCamping.\nThere is one free camping site in the National Park at Fairhaven, 4\u00a0km up the coast road from Tankerton Jetty, where the ferry arrives from Stony Point. The camp site is set among trees near the beach, with one public toilet and a water tank. Other camping is available at \"private sites\" at Bayview and McLeod Eco Farm by arrangement. "}

The term \"Aryan\" comes from the Rig Veda and is the name of an ancient group of people in ancient Persia and India, who spoke an Indo-European language. It has been used to describe people of Iranian and Indian descent, but there was no record of Aryans in European history. Later it was used for Germanic peoples because of new ideas about the Aryans.\nThe term Aryan comes from the ancient Sanskrit word \u0101rya, which was a term used by Sanskrit speaking people to distinguish themselves from other races. The Iranians also used the terms, and the name Iran means \"land of the Aryans\". The idea of an Aryan race was first used as a category of people but was later used by occult movements such as Theosophy. It was also later used by Nazis and white supremacists in racist ways.\nNazism.\nThe ideology of Nazism was based upon the idea of the Aryan race or Germanic peoples being a master race. The Nazi view of the Aryan race came from earlier racial theorists such as Arthur de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain.\nAs the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, became set in his ways, he decided with proclamations that some other groups of people were also Aryans along with Germanic peoples. He declared Hungarians to be \"Aryan\" in 1934, the Japanese were made officially \"Aryans\" in 1936, and the Finns were officially added in as \"Aryans\" by his proclamation in 1942. However, Nazi Germany did not regard Slavs as \"Aryans\", but as inferiors and non-Aryan. They were usually vague as to whether Italians were \"Aryan\", although Italy under Mussolini had a \"Manifesto of Race\" in 1938 that said they were.\nOccult belief.\nTheosophy, a mystical occult society founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky believes that the Arabian people and the Jews are a part of the Aryan race. It is believed by Theosophists that the Arabians used the Semitic languages of the people around them. These people had moved to the area from Atlantis. Theosophists claim that the Jews began as a part of the Arabian subrace in what is now Yemen around 30,000 BC. They moved first to Somalia and then to Egypt where they lived until the time of Moses."}

Like previous years, a system of two semi-finals was used: the first on 10 May and the second on 13 May 2011. The final was on the evening of 14 May 2011. The winners were Ell &amp; Nikki with their song Running scared, they represented Azerbaijan.\nVenue.\nOn 12 October 2010, the German broadcaster, Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) announced that the Esprit Arena of D\u00fcsseldorf as the venue of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. Germany has already held the Eurovision Song Contest. The first in 1957 in Frankfurt am Main and the second in 1983 in Munich. Since 1998 and the victory of the United Kingdom the year before, it is the first time that a country of the \"Big Five\" (Germany, France, Spain, United Kingdom &amp; Italy (since 2011)) will held the Eurovision Song Contest.\nBidding Phase.\n23 cities of Germany participated to the bidding phase of the venue for the 56 Annual Eurovision Song Contest. Eight cities showed interest of hosting the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 : Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover, Gelsenkirchen, D\u00fcsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich. On 21 August 2010, NDR announced that four of those cities had officially applied to host the 2011 Contest : \nFormat.\nThe five countries that are part of the \"Big Five\", along with the host of the contest, automatically qualify for a place in the final. But Germany is both the host of the 2011 edition and a member from the \"Big Five\". To answer this question of if a country will qualify directly for the final (maybe the second of the 2010 Contest), the EBU held a meeting in Belgrade (Serbia). And it was decided that the existing rules will remain in place, and that the number of participants in the final will simply decreased from twenty-five to twenty-four.

Countries has been drawn from each pot to determine if they will compete in either the first or second semi-final and like in 2010, it will determine in which half of the semi-final they will perform, in order for delegations to know when rehearsals will begin for their respective countries. The draw also determine in which semi-finals the members of the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy) will be able to vote. \nIsraeli broadcaster IBA requested to take part in the second semi-final due to the Israeli Memorial Day, which will be held during the first semi-final. German broadcaster NDR also requested that they be allowed to vote in the second semi-final for scheduling reasons.\nParticipating Countries.\nOn 31 December 2010, the EBU confirmed the forty-three countries which will be competing fir the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest.

Keynes wrote about his theories in his book \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\". The book was published in 1936.\nKeynes said capitalism is a good economic system. In a capitalist system, people earn money from their work. Businesses employ and pay people to work. Then people can spend their money on things they want. Other people work and make things to buy. Sometimes the capitalist system has problems. People lose their work. Businesses close. People cannot work and cannot spend money. Keynes said the government should step in and help people who do not have work.\nThis idea is called \"demand-side policy\". If people are working, the economy is good. If people are not working, the economy is bad.\nKeynes said when the economy is bad, people want to save their money. That is, they do not spend their money on, or invest in, things they want. As a result, there is less economic activity. \nKeynes said the government should spend more money when people do not have work. The government can borrow money and give people jobs (work). Then people can spend money again and buy things. This helps other people find work.\nSome people, such as conservatives, libertarians, and people who believe in Austrian economics, do not agree with Keynes' ideas. They say government work does not help capitalism. They say when the government borrows money, it takes money away from businesses. They do not like Keynesian economics because they say the economy can get better without government help.\nDuring the late 1970s, Keynesian economics became less popular because inflation was high at the same time that unemployment was high. This is because many people interpreted Keynesian theory to say that it was impossible for there to be both high inflation and high unemployment. \nWhen a big recession happened in 2007, Keynesian economics became more popular. Leaders around the world (including Barack Obama) created stimulus packages which would allow their government to spend a lot of money to create jobs. Conservatives and Libertarians would say that the stimulus package rewards the bad behavior that lead to the recession. It tells big banks that they can misbehave and the government will step in and get them out of trouble.\nBasic ideas.\nKeynes had the following ideas:"}

Elam was centered in the far west and southwest of what is now modern-day Iran, stretching from the lowlands of what is now Khuzestan and Ilam Province as well as a small part of southern Iraq..\nHistory.\nKnowledge of Elamite history is not complete. It is mainly known from Mesopotamian sources. The history of Elam is divided into three periods, over more than two millennia. The three periods come after the proto-Elamite period:\nThe Proto-Elamite city of Susa was founded around 5000 BC in the watershed of the river Karun. It is considered to be the site of Proto-Elamite cultural formation. \nWritten records start from around 3000 BC in the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age). In the Achaemenid Empire the Elamite language was among those in official use. The Elamite language has no obvious connections with any other, and seems to be a language isolate like Sumerian. Some researchers have suggested the existence of a larger group known as Elamo-Dravidian. This theory is not established.\nThe Elamites called their country Haltamti, but the Sumerians and Akkadians called it Elam, and so it was also in the Hebrew Bible. The civilisation started around 2700 BC, and they were finally conquered by the Achmaenids in 640 BC. A tablet found in 1848 has the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal boasting of his conquest:\nAs it happens, the Elamites managed to stay independent for some time after this disaster. The devastation was less complete than Assurbanipal boasted, and Elamite rule, though rather broken up, continued until 540 BC, when Achaemenid rule begins in Susa. Under the Parthian period, a kingdom of Elymais existed which survived until its extinction by Sassanid invasion in the early third century AD. It was in the heartland of ancient Elam."}

They are to make the teeth straight, and to correct problems in a person's bite.

The first was proclaimed on 7 September 1990.\nThe government of Serbia said that the declaration was illegal. It took the case to the International Court of Justice. The ICJ said that the declaration did not violate international law.\nUnited Nations.\nFollowing a request from Russia, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency session in the afternoon of 17 February. The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, issued a statement that avoided taking sides and urged all parties \"to refrain from any actions of statements that could endanger peace, incite violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo or the region.\" Speaking on behalf of six western countries\u2014Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy and the United States\u2014the Belgian ambassador expressed regret \"that the Security Council cannot agree on the way forward, but this impasse has been clear for many months. Today's events... represent the conclusion of a status process that has exhausted all avenues in pursuit of a negotiated outcome.\"\nICJ ruling.\nOn July 22, 2010 the International Court of Justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law. Prior to the announcement Hashim Tha\u00e7i said there would be no \"winners or losers\" and that \"I expect this to be a correct decision, according to the will of Kosovo's citizens. Kosovo will respect the advisory opinion.\" For his part, Boris Tadi\u0107, the Serbian president, warned that \"If the International Court of Justice sets a new principle, it would trigger a process that would create several new countries and destabilise numerous regions in the world.\""}

Grupo Santander is one of the largest banks in the world (in terms of market capitalisation). It originated in Santander, Cantabria, Spain.\nHistory.\nBanco Hispanoamericano was created in 1900. Banco Central was created in 1919. Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano merged.\nBanco Santander was founded in 1857. Banco Central Hispano was founded in 1991. In 1999, Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano merged, creating Banco Santander Central Hispano, or BSCH.\nThe 1999 merger between Santander and Central Hispano was designed to be a \"merger of equals\". The top executives of the two firms would share control of the new firm. Soon after the merger former Central Hispano executives thought chairman Botin of trying to control the firm. They threatened to take legal action against him. The issue was resolved when Central Hispano the executives agreed to severance payments (money given when leaving a company), retirement. They also turned control of the firm over to Mr. Botin. This action cost the shareholders of the firm \u20ac164M.\nBecause of the large payouts, Mr. Botin was brought to trial on criminal charges of \"misappropriation of funds\" (using company money the wrong way) and \"irresponsible management.\" In April 2005 he was cleared of all charges. The decision said the retirement payments made were legal, \"made as compensation for the services provided to the bank.\" \nIn 2005, Mr. Botin was accused of insider trading (trading stock based on knowledge the general public did not have). The anti-corruption division of the Spanish public prosecutor's office cleared Mr. Botin of all charges.\nOn 26 July 2004 Banco Santander Central Hispano announced the purchase of Abbey National plc.

Nicknamed the \"Scarlet Speedster\", all versions of the Flash who have the ability to travel at a very high speed, use superhuman reflexes and defy the laws of physics. The original Flash first appeared in\u00a0\"Flash Comics\"\u00a0#1 (cover date January 1940 / release month November 1939). This fictional character was created by writer Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert.\nThus far, at least four different\u00a0characters\u2014each of whom somehow gained the power of the\u00a0\"Speed Force\"\u2014have assumed the role of the Flash in DC's history: College athlete Jay Garrick (1940\u20131951, 1961\u20132011, 2017\u2013present) was the first character to take on the alter-ego \"The Flash\", other characters who have been the Flash are forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956\u20131985, 2008\u2013present), Barry's brother-in-law Wally West (1986\u20132011, 2016\u2013present) who is currently the youngest Flash, he calls himself \"Kid Flash\"; and Barry's grandson Bart Allen (2006\u20132007) who becomes \"Impulse\", the second hero known as Kid Flash. Each version of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC's premier teams: the\u00a0Justice Society of America, the\u00a0Justice League, and the Teen Titans. Most of the Flash stories take place in the fictional city of Central City.\nThe Flash is one of DC Comics' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher's many reality-changing \"crisis\" storylines over the years. The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in \"Flash of Two Worlds\" (1961) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers, which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come.\nFictional characters biographies.\nJay Garrick.\nThe original Flash Jay Garrick from the Golden Age got his powers by inhaling heavy water vapors after falling asleep in his science lab. He first used his powers to become a star football player. Then later he began to use his powers to fight crime. The character was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, and he first appeared in \"Flash Comics #1\" (1940)\nBarry Allen.\nBarry Allen is a police scientist. He got his powers when a lightning bolt hit his lab and splashed a number of chemicals on him. Becoming Flash was ironic as Barry was slow, methodical, and often late prior to gaining his powers. He is the Flash from the Silver Age, he was created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino and he first appeared in \"Showcase\" #4 (October 1956).\nWally West.\nWally West got his powers at the young age of ten when he visited his uncle's laboratory (Uncle Barry Allen who was already Flash). He got some chemicals on him and gained the power of super-speed. Since he was so young he became \"Kid Flash\". Later on he would take over the role of his uncle as Flash. He is somehow the Flash from the Modern Age. He made his first appearance as the Kid Flash in the \"Flash#110\" in 1959 and he was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino.\nBart Allen.\nBart Allen is Barry Allen's grandson. He was born with Super-speed, but also fast aging causing him to appear twelve when he was only two years old. Once he got his aging under control he became \"Impulse\". He would later become Kid Flash and finally Flash once he had grown up. The character was created by Mark Waid and Mike Wieringo and he first made a cameo appearance in \"The Flash\" #91 in 1994, while his first full appearance in issue #92, and appeared as the lead character in \"Impulse\" (1995\u20132002) and \"\" (2006\u20132007).\nJesse Chambers.\nDaughter of the speedster Johnny Quick, Jesse Chambers becomes a speeding superhero like her father. She later meets Wally West, the Flash, who asks her to be his replacement if something were to happen to him (as part of an elaborate plan on his part, trying to force Bart Allen to take his role in the legacy of the Flash more seriously). She briefly assumes the mantle of the Flash, after Wally enters the Speed Force.\nJohn Fox.\nJohn Fox was a historian for the National Academy of Science in Central City in the 27th Century. He was sent back in time to get the help of one or more of the three Flashes (Garrick, Allen, West), in order to defeat the radioactive villain Mota back in Fox's own time period. (Each Flash had individually fought Mota over the course of several years in the 20th century.) Fox's mission was a failure, but during his return trip, the tachyon radiation that sent him through the time stream gave him superspeed. He defeated Mota as a new iteration of the Flash and operated as his century's Flash for a time. Shortly after, he moved to the 853rd century and joined \"Justice Legion A\" (also known as Justice Legion Alpha) as seen in the DC One Million series of books. The name \"John Fox\" is combined from the names of seminal comic book writers John Broome, who co-created the Barry Allen and Wally West Flashes, and Gardner Fox, who co-created the Jay Garrick Flash.\nUnnamed Allen of the 23rd century.\nThe father of Sela Allen, his wife and daughter were captured by Cobalt Blue. He is forced to watch his wife die and his daughter become crippled. As he and Max Mercury kill Cobalt Blue, a child takes Cobalt Blue's power gem and kills Allen. This Flash is one of the two destined Flashes to be killed by Cobalt Blue.\nSela Allen.\nSela Allen is an ordinary human in the 23rd century until Cobalt Blue steals electrical impulses away from her, causing her to become as slow to the world as the world is to the Flash. Hoping to restore her, her father takes her into the Speed Force. When her father is killed, she appears as a living manifestation of the Speed Force, able to lend speed to various people and objects, but unable to physically interact with the world.\nBlaine Allen.\nBlaine Allen and his son live on the colony world of Petrus in the 28th century. In an attempt to end the Allen blood line, Cobalt Blue injects Allen's son Jace with a virus. Lacking super speed, Jace was unable to shake off the virus. In despair, Blaine takes his son to the Speed Force in the hopes that it would accept him. It takes Blaine instead and grants super speed to Jace so that he can shake off the sickness.\nJace Allen.\nJace Allen gains super speed when his father brings him into the Speed Force to attempt to cure him of a virus injected into his body by Cobalt Blue in an attempt to end the Allen bloodline. In memory of his father, Jace assumes the mantle of the Flash and continues the feud against Cobalt Blue.\nKryiad.\nAfter an alien creature invades Earth, a history buff named Kriyad travels back in time from the 98th century to acquire a Green Lantern power ring. He fails, so he tries to capture the Flash's speed instead. After being beaten by Barry Allen (\"The Flash\" (vol. 1) #309, May 1982), he travels back further in time and uses the chemicals from the clothes Barry Allen was wearing when he gained his powers to give himself super speed. Kryiad later sacrifices his life to defeat the alien creature.\nBizarro Flash.\nBizarro-Flash was created when Bizarro cloned Flash. He had a costume the reverse colors of Flash's, however he had a mallet symbol because Flash was holding one when he was cloned. The modern version of Bizarro Flash has the symbol of a thunderbolt-shaped mustard stain. He has the powers of the Flash but he is completely intangible.\nSupporting characters.\nLike his Justice League colleagues Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, the Flash has a distinctive cast of adversaries, including the various Rogues (unique among DC supervillains for their code of honor) and the various psychopathic \"speedsters\" who go by the names Reverse-Flash or Zoom. Other supporting characters in \"Flash\" stories include Barry's wife Iris West, Wally's wife Linda Park, Bart's girlfriend Valerie Perez, friendly fellow speedster Max Mercury, and Central City police department members David Singh and Patty Spivot.\nAdaptations.\nThe Flash has been adapted to numerous DC films, video games, animated series, and live-action television shows. In live action, Barry Allen has been portrayed by Rod Haase for the 1979 television special \"Legends of the Superheroes\", John Wesley Shipp portrayed the title character in the 1990's television series \"The Flash\" and Grant Gustin portrays Barry Allen in the 2014 television series titled \"The Flash\". Shipp also portrays a version of Jay Garrick in the 2014\u00a0\"The Flash\"\u00a0series. Ezra Miller played the Flash in ' and will again in \"Justice League\" (2017). The various incarnations of the Flash also feature in animated series such as , \"Justice League\", \u00a0\"and\"\u00a0\"Young Justice', as well as the\u00a0DC Universe Animated Original Movies\u00a0series."}

Eni is present in 70 countries, and currently is Italy's largest industrial company. It has a market capitalization of US$ 38.06 billion, as of 31 December 2020. The Italian Government owns a 30.33% golden share in the company. Golden shares are special stock shares that allow the government to control a company. 4.37% of the shares are held through the state Treasury and 25.96% are held through the Cassa depositi e prestiti (a bank mostly owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Italy). Eni ranks among the top 100 on Fortune Global 500 list for largest companies by revenue.\nHistory.\nAgip was started in 1926. After World War II, Enrico Mattei was appointed Special Administrator to close down Agip. With the discovery of the Caviaga gas field in the Po Valley, the process of closing Agip was halted. Enrico Mattei converted it to a state monopoly (a company with no competition), and renamed it Eni. Eni comes from the company's original full name \"Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi\" (National Hydrocarbons Agency). Eni was to supply energy to Italy and contribute to the country's industrial development.\nEni decided that natural gas would supply the energy needed from the crisis of the 1973 oil embargo. They import gas from the Soviet Union and the Netherlands. Snam started the Transmediterranean pipeline, moving gas from the Hassi-R-Mel field in Algeria to the Po Valley. The gas pipeline was more than 2,500\u00a0km or 1550 miles long. It started in the Algerian desert and crosses Tunisia. It then crosses the Sicilian Channel at a water depth of over 650 metres or 2100 feet. Next it goes through Sicily and up the length of the entire Italian peninsula.\nIn the 1990s, Eni changed from a public corporation into a joint stock company. Most of Eni's share capital was put on the market in four successive public issues. Agip's international work increased with new acquisitions in Algeria, China, Angola, the North Sea and Egypt. New agreements were signed with Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and for the Nigerian and Angolan deep water oil. Eni incorporated Agip, and became an oil and gas producer. Eni's daily oil and gas production reached the equivalent of 1,871 million barrels of oil.\nIn the 2000s, Eni started many projects for the production of renewable sources in Italy, such as the conversion of its refineries in Porto Marghera and in Gela into biorefineries (refineries that convert organic material to energy), or Progetto Italia, to build photovoltaic plants in Sardinia (Assemini, Porto Torres).\nEni is the main shareholder of the American company Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS). Together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), CFS is trying to build a fusion reactor using a principle called Tokamak. This reactor is expected to be cheaper than the ones designed in other international projects. In September 2021 CFS carried out an experiment using high-temperature superconductors, which showed that it is possible to create a fusion chamber that mimics the fusion process of deuterium and tritium that occurs inside the sun, in order to produce sustainable energy.\nCurrent operations.\nExploration and production.\nEni operates in the exploration (searching) and production of hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) in Italy, North Africa, West Africa, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Australia. It also operates in areas with great potential to produce oil such as the Caspian Sea, the Middle and Far East, India and Alaska.\nIts crude oil production comes primarily from Libya, Egypt, Nigeria, the Congo, the North Sea, and Angola. Smaller amounts of crude oil production come from Tunisia and in the United States. Eni's China production began in 1992, but it is only 1 percent of Eni's total crude oil production.\nGas.\nEni supplies natural gas. Gas sales reached 73.07 billion cubic meters in 2019. In June 2008 the company bought 57% of Distrigas, a Belgian company that supplies natural gas. In March 2009 it bought the rest of Distrigas. As of June 30, 2009 Distrigas is a fully owned subsidiary of Eni.\nPower.\nEni's generates electricity in Italy, using both natural gas and solar power.\nEngineering and construction.\nEni operates Saipem, a subsidiary, and owns 30.54% of the company. Saipem works in engineering, and oilfield services and construction.\nRefining and marketing.\nEni is one of the majors operators in refining and marketing of petroleum products in Italy. Eni is also engaged in retail and wholesales activities in Central Europe and Eastern Europe.\nSustainability.\nSince 2007, Eni ranked in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and it was also included in the FTSE4Good Index, two famous indexes that evaluate the sustainability performance and the ethical investments of the companies on the stock exchange. In 2013 Eni was the only FTSE MIB (Milano Italia Borsa) company to have the triple E for Standard Ethics. Eni is among the Top 10 companies by sustainability score in the WBCSD rank, a rank conceived by a global organization including over 200 international companies that works on issues related to sustainable development. Eni is involved in many projects to help fighting the climate change and cooperates with several institution to reduce its impact on the environment.\nControversies.\nThe Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom. Eni was one of the two companies selected to provide natural gas to Italy. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was a close friend of one of the main owners of Eni. The Italian parliament canceled the contract. In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired (planned) to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines. In 2010, Eni proposed to sell its shares of the pipelines TAG, TENP e Transitgas and the European Commission accepted Eni proposal."}

They are the Formula One racing team and constructor (builder) of Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz debuted in Formula One in , and competed with great success in the and seasons. After the 1955 season, Mercedes left the sport. Despite part-ownerships, and engine supplier deals in the 1990s and 2000s, it did not return as a factory team until November 2009.\nMercedes has been supplying engines to the McLaren team since . Mercedes-Benz, through its parent Daimler AG, and in partnership with Aabar Investments, reached an agreement to purchase the Brawn GP team. Daimler would buy 45.1% of Brawn, and Aabar would buy 30%. The purchase would be pending corporate and regulatory approval. The Brawn team was created when they purchased the Honda Racing F1 team. Brawn had won the drivers' and constructors' championships in the season, their first and only season as a team.\nFormer Williams driver Nico Rosberg was joined by seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher for the team's maiden racing season. Mercedes has Nick Heidfeld as the test and reserve driver. In August, Mercedes released Heidfeld from his contract to allow him to do tyre testing. He will test the new Pirelli tyre that will be used in the season. In September, Heidfeld was signed by Sauber to replace Pedro de la Rosa.\nEarly history.\nMercedes in Grand Prix motor racing (1930s\u20131955).\nMercedes-Benz first competed in Grand Prix motor racing in the 1930s. The Silver Arrows cars by Mercedes-Benz and rivals Auto Union were the best racing cars. Both teams were heavily funded by the Nazi regime. They won all the European Grand Prix Championships after 1932. Rudolf Caracciola won three of the championships for Mercedes-Benz.\nIn 1954 Mercedes-Benz returned to racing in the current f1 series using the advanced Mercedes-Benz W196 (pictured). This car was run in both open-wheeled and streamlined (body work that covered the wheels) forms. Juan Manuel Fangio, a previous champion the season transferred mid-season from Maserati to Mercedes-Benz for their debut at the French Grand Prix on July 4, 1954. The team had immediate success with a 1-2 victory (taking both first and second place) with Fangio and Karl Kling. They also set the fastest lap of the race with (Hans Herrmann). Fangio went on to win three more races in 1954, and won the Formula One World Championship.\nThey continued to have success in the season, where the same car was used again. Mercedes dominated the season, with Fangio wining four races, and his new team mate Stirling Moss winning the British Grand Prix. Fangio and Moss finished first and second in 1955's World Championship. A terrible crash at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 11 killed Mercedes driver Pierre Levegh and over 80 spectators. This crash led to the cancellations of the French, German, Spanish and Swiss Grands Prix that year. Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor sport, including Formula One, at the end of the 1955 season.\nThe company made a return to the Formula One in by unofficially supplying the Sauber team with engines. The next year, the partnership was made official. For , Mercedes change teams and started supplying engines to the McLaren. Mercedes also purchased a small portion of the McLaren. McLaren won three drivers' championships and one constructors' championship between 1995 and . In 2009, Mercedes began supplying engines to the Brawn GP and Force India teams. In 2009, Brawn won both the driver's and constructors' championship.\nPre-Mercedes.\nThe current Mercedes team can be traced back to the long-running Tyrrell Racing team. Tyrrell competed as a constructor from 1970 until 1998. In 1999, Tyrrell became British American Racing (BAR). BAR formed a partnership with Honda, and becoming Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006. In December 2008, Honda decided to leave Formula One racing, and Brawn GP, was formed from the Honda Team. Brawn's association with Mercedes began when the team opted to use the Mercedes FO 108W engine at the last minute. Mercedes needed special permission to supply engines to Brawn. The Formula One regulations at the time only allowed an engine supplier to supply two teams. Mercedes was already supplying engines to both McLaren and Force India.\nBrawn won the first race it entered at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix. Jenson Button won six of their first seven races of the season, and won the World Championship. His team-mate Rubens Barrichello won at Valencia and Italy. Both Button and Brawn went on to secure the Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships in the race in Brazil, the next to the last race of the season. It was the first time in the sport's sixty-year history that a team won both the drivers' and constructors' titles in its maiden (first) season.\n2010: Return to Formula One.\nAcquisition of Brawn GP.\nOn November 16, 2009, it was officially announced that Mercedes would acquire the Brawn team, with Ross Brawn continuing his duties as team leader. The team will continue to be located in Brackley, United Kingdom. Brackley is less than 30 miles away from Mercedes' Formula One engine plant in Brixworth.\nNico Rosberg was announced as the team's first driver on November 23, 2009. On December 23, 2009, seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher announced that he will be returning to Formula One with the Mercedes team. Brawn's former drivers Jenson Button joined McLaren, and Rubens Barrichello joined Williams team for 2010. With the acquisition of Brawn, Mercedes parted ways with McLaren. The 40% stake that Daimler (which owns Mercedes) has in McLaren will be sold back to the McLaren Group for a reported \u00a3500m.\nOne reason given for Mercedes parting with McLaren was \"because of McLaren's ambitious plans to build road cars\". McLaren plan to put the McLaren MP4-12C in production by 2011. Mercedes has said it would continue to supply engines to McLaren until 2015.\nSponsorship.\nIn December 2009, the team suffered an early setback when it was discovered that sponsorship deal was invalid. An eighty million pound sponsorship arrangement that had been signed by Brawn with the German company Henkel was invalid. Henkel claimed they were unaware of the deal and were not interested in Formula One. They said the deal was made by a former Henkel employee on stolen company stationery to defrauding the company. On December 22, Henkel announced that the dispute with the Mercedes had been resolved with a mutual agreement and that legal action would not be pursued. Henkel plans to work with the German Prosecutor's Office to clarify the matter.\nOn December 21, the team announced that Malaysian oil supplier Petronas would join the team as the main sponsor. The team will compete under the full title of Mercedes GP Petronas Formula One Team. According to some reports, the sponsorship is valued at thirty million Euros each year. Together with the fifty million the team received for winning the 2009 championship as Brawn, Mercedes has a budget of eighty million Euros before spending any of their own money.\nOn January 25, 2010, the team's livery (paint scheme) was publicly unveiled at the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart, with Schumacher and Rosberg in attendance. The car races in Mercedes' traditional silver colors and retains Brawn GP sponsor MIGfx and adds investment group Aabar to its list of sponsors."}

They are similar to dragonflies, but are in a separate suborder, the Zygoptera. There are 20 families of damselfly. \"Demoiselle\" is another name for damselflies.\nThe wings of most damselflies are held along, and parallel to, the body when at rest. There are also damselfly families in which the wings are held open, as in the true dragonflies (Anisoptera). \nDamselflies are also usually smaller, weaker fliers than dragonflies. Their eyes are well separated by more than their own diameter. Another distinction is that their forewings and hindwings look similar; this is not the case in the true dragonflies. Like dragonflies, damselflies cannot walk, but only land. Their life cycle is also similar. They have incomplete metamorphosis, with an aquatic nymph. The nymph is carnivorous, as is the adult.\nDamselflies have existed since the later Carboniferous (early forms may be put in the Protozygoptera by some authorities). They are found on every continent except Antarctica. One feature of their life is different from dragonflies. Not only do their nymphs grow in rivers, but the adults usually keep close to the river, and live in colourful little groups. Most damselflies live their lives within a short distance of where they were hatched.\nThey are often brilliantly coloured, but when they land on a bush, out of direct sunlight, they are not easy to see. They land and close their wings at the same instant. They have eyes which detect movement well, and they fly off if anything moves nearby. Thus, although they are fragile and highly coloured, they are not easily caught by predators.\nAll damselflies are predatory; both nymphs and adults eat other insects."}

This use of the term 'rumba' is quite different from the Latin ballroom dance.\nSecond, it refers to one of the Latin ballroom dances. In this sense, the Rumba is the slowest of the five competitive International Latin dances. The Paso doble, the Samba, the Cha-cha-cha and the Jive are the others. This ballroom Rumba was also danced in Cuba to a rhythm they call the \"bolero-son\". The international style was derived from studies of dance in Cuba in the pre-revolutionary period.\nRumba outside Cuba.\nThe \"Peanut Vendor\" was the first recording of Cuban music to become an international hit. It was described on the label as a \"rumba\", perhaps because the word \"son\" would not be understood in English. The label stuck, and a 'rumba craze' developed through the 1930s. This kind of rumba was introduced into dance salons in America and Europe in the 1930s, and was characterized by variable tempo, sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom Rumba.\nBallroom Rumba.\nThe modern style of dancing the Rumba derives from studies made by dance teacher Monsieur Pierre (Pierre Zurcher-Margolle). Pierre, then from London, visited Cuba in 1947, 1951 and 1953 to find out how and what Cubans were dancing at the time.Intro \nThe international ballroom Rumba is a slower dance of about 120 beats per minute which corresponds, both in music and in dance to what the Cubans of an older generation called the \"bolero-son\". It is easy to see why, for ease of reference and for marketing, \"rumba\" is a better name, however inaccurate. It is the same kind of reason that led later on to the use of salsa as an overall term for popular music of Cuban origin.\nAll social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is hardly noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba. Walter Laird put it like this:\nIn general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced without any rise and fall. This style is authentic, as is the use of free arms in various figures. The basic figures derive from dance moves observed in Havana in the pre-revolutionary period, and have developed their own life since then. Competition figures are often complex, and this is where competition dance separates from social dance. Details can be obtained from the syllabi of dance teaching organizations and from standard texts."}

Today it is mostly done in Spain, and in Portugal, and some countries of South America.\nThe largest bullring is the Plaza M\u00e9xico in central Mexico City, which seats 48,000 people, and the oldest is the La Maestranza in Seville, Spain, which was first used for bullfighting in 1765.\nThe Spanish bullfight (\"Corrida de toros\") is a fight to the death. The modern bullfight has a ritual. It has three distinct stages, the start of each being signalled by a trumpet. The bullfighters (\"Toreros\") enter the arena in a parade, to Paso doble music. The rules, costumes and traditions were sorted out by Paquiro (Francisco Montes Reina, 13 January 1804 4 April 1851, the greatest matador of his time.\nA team of bullfighters is seven men. The leader is the matador, and he has six assistants, who play roles in the drama. Bullfighters' costumes are inspired by 18th century Andalusian clothing. \"Matadores\" ('those who kill the bull') are easily seen by the gold of their \"traje de luces\" ('suit of lights').\nAt the end comes the \"tercio de muerte\" ('the third of death'). The matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape, and a sword. The cape called a \"muleta\". The matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes. The \"faena\" is the performance with the cape. The \"faena\" ends with a final series of passes in which the bullfighter tries to move the bull into position. He then stabs it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The act of thrusting in the sword is called an \"estocada\".\nIf the matador gets it wrong, he may be gored by the bull's horns, and killed. This does happen: some very famous matadors have died in the ring. When the great matador Manolete was killed in the ring at the age of 31, three days of official national mourning were held. Bullrings do have an infirmary with an operating room, for the immediate treatment of bullfighters with horn wounds.\nThere is great opposition to the bullfight from animal welfare organisations. There are also versions of the bullfight in which the animal is unharmed.\nArt.\nBullfighting has influenced all forms of art and culture. Ernest Hemingway said of bullfinghting: \"Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour\". Spanish dance and musical forms such as the paso doble and flamenco are heavily influenced by the spectacle of the bullfight."}

When liquid water is available between the snow and ice crystals, they may color the surface green, yellow or red during the summer months. The red pigment of some species is an intracellular protection against excessive visual light and ultraviolet radiation of the sun, which otherwise can cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis or mutations. Without it, the algae at the surface would suffer chromosome breaks and DNA mutations.\nThere are also ice algal communities on sea ice. These algae (mainly diatoms) are important in polar ecosystems (especially Antarctica) because they provide food for krill. Krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice, which is colored brown by the algae. The algae may be found between ice crystals or attached to them, in the water or saltwater channels between ice crystals. \n\"Chlamydomonas nivalis\".\n\"Chlamydomonas nivalis\" is a green microalga which causes, besides other closely relative species, Watermelon snow.\nWatermelon snow is snow that is reddish or pink in color, and that can have a smell similar to a fresh watermelon. This type of snow is common during the summer in alpine and coastal polar regions, such as the Sierra Nevada of California. Here, at altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000 feet (3,000\u20133,600\u00a0m), the temperature is cold throughout the year, and so the snow lingers from winter storms. When someone steps on the snow with algae, the footprints look red. \n\"Chlamydomonas nivalis\" is a green alga which owes its red color to a bright red carotenoid pigment (Astaxanthin). This protects the chloroplast and cell nucleus from strong visible and ultraviolet radiation. The green and red pigments absorb light and heat, which gives the alga liquid water as the snow melts around it. Algal blooms may go 25 cm (10 inches) deep. Since each cell measures 20 to 30 micrometers in diameter, a teaspoon of melted snow contains a million or more cells. The algae build up in 'sun cups', which are shallow depressions in the snow. The carotenoid pigment absorbs heat, which deepens the sun cups, and makes the glaciers and snowbanks melt faster.\nDuring the winter months, when white snow covers them, the algae become dormant. In spring, nutrients, increased levels of light and meltwater, stimulate germination. Once they germinate, the resting cells release smaller green flagellate cells which travel towards the surface of the snow. Once the flagellated come close to the surface, they may lose their flagellae and form thick-walled resting cells, or they may function as gametes, fusing in pairs to form zygotes.\nSome specialised species feed on \"C. nivalis\", including protozoans such as ciliates, rotifers, nematodes, ice worms and springtails.\nHistory.\nThe first accounts of watermelon snow are in the writings of Aristotle. Watermelon snow has puzzled mountain climbers, explorers, and naturalists for thousands of years.\nIn May 1818, four ships sailed from England to search for the Northwest Passage and chart the Arctic coastline of North America. Bad weather made them finally turn the ships back, but the expedition made important contributions to science. Captain John Ross noticed crimson snow that streaked the white cliffs like streams of blood as they were rounding Cape York on the northwest coast of Greenland. A landing party stopped and brought back samples to England. \"The Times\" wrote about this discovery on December 4, 1818:\nWhen Ross published his story of the voyage in 1818, the story had an appendix of plants by Robert Brown. In it, Brown compared the red snow to an alga."}

Red Bull changed the name of the team after taking control of the team to 'Scuderia Toro Rosso'.\nRacing history.\n2006 season.\nVitantonio Liuzzi and Scott Speed were the race drivers, with Neel Jani filling the test/third driver role. Liuzzi had raced part time for Red Bull Racing in , while Speed entered F1 following the Red Bull Driver Search in the United States. Jani was the test driver for Sauber Petronas in .\nThe 2006 Toro Rosso chassis was a modified version of the 2005 Red Bull Racing RB1. Some teams felt that this infringed the rule that each team must design their own car. Toro Rosso claim that this design was first produced during by Jaguar Racing, Red Bull's predecessor. They believed that the design rights had belonged to the Ford Motor Company, Jaguar Racing's parent company before passing to Toro Rosso.\nThe new Formula One regulations for 2006 required new V8 engines. Toro Rosso was allowed to used Minardi's supply of power limited Cosworth 3 liter V10 engines. This option had been created to assist the less funded teams the expense of building new engines. Formula One allowing Toro Rosso to use this option after the Red Bull takeover caused friction with other teams, in particular Super Aguri and Midland. These teams felt that the engine gave Toro Rosso too much of an advantage. They relived that the concession to allow the team use the V10 engine was based on Minardi's poor financial situation, and should not have apply after the team was purchased by Red Bull.\n2007 season.\n For the season, Toro Rosso began using the Ferrari 056 V8 engine, taking over the contract that Red Bull Racing broke from by switching to Renault engines.\nAt the launch of the STR2 on 13 February, Gerhard Berger confirmed Liuzzi as a driver. In testing in Bahrain on 24 February, Scott Speed was confirmed as the team's second driver. Three-time Champ Car champion S\u00e9bastien Bourdais was the unofficial test driver several times during the season.\nThe 2007 season was generally disappointing. The team suffered poor reliability and driver errors that lead to a low number of race finishes. Following the European Grand Prix, Scott Speed was removed as a driver. He was replaced by BMW Sauber development driver Sebastian Vettel. Vettel was later confirmed as a driver for .\nAt the Chinese Grand Prix, Toro Rosso scored their best results. Vettel finishing fourth and Liuzzi sixth, scoring eight points for the team. These were also the drivers' best finishes in Formula One. It was a big improvement over the preceding race. At the Japanese Grand Prix, Vettel crashed into Mark Webber's Red Bull under safety car conditions (full course yellow). Webber was running in second place, and Vettel was in third place. Liuzzi lost the possibility of scoring a point after a 25-second penalty. He was penalized for passing Adrian Sutil's Spyker for eighth place under a local yellow flag condition. The penalty dropped him to ninth place.\n2008 season.\nScuderia Toro Rosso's drivers for were Sebastian Vettel and S\u00e9bastien Bourdais. Bourdais earned his first points in F1 with a 7th place finish at the Australian Grand Prix. Vettel scored his first points of the season with a 5th place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix. \nThe team pulled off a massive shock at the wet Italian Grand Prix. Vettel claiming a pole position and won the race. It was the first pole and win for both himself and Toro Rosso. This was also the first win for a Ferrari engine in a customer chassis. Vettel's performances earned him a place at Red Bull Racing for .\n2009 season.\n With Vettel moving to Red Bull Racing S\u00e9bastien Buemi and S\u00e9bastien Bourdais were the Toro Rosso drivers for . Before the season started, the team's boss Franz Tost said that it would be \"difficult\" to do as well as they did in the 2008 season. On 16 July, Toro Rosso announced that Bourdais' contract was terminated. On 20 July, the team announced that Jaime Alguersuari will replace Bourdais starting with the Hungarian Grand Prix. \nThe season ended with Toro Rosso finishing in last place in the championship. Force India was able to move ahead in the point race after finishing second in the Belgian Grand Prix. At the end of the season, S\u00e9bastien Buemi was able to score points in the final two races. Jaime Alguersuari failed to score any points in the season.\nControversy was present as whether or not the team threw away their chances by having two inexperienced drivers as essentially their car had the same DNA as what is said to have been the best on the grid, Redbull Racing's RB5.\n2010.\nScuderia Toro Rosso confirmed that they would keep S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari for . Under the new regulations they also had to build and design their own car without help from Red Bull Technology, the teams first since Minardi. Alguersuari scored the first points of his career finishing ninth at the Malaysian Grand Prix. They went on to perform poorly throughout the season occasionally mixing it with the saubers, Force Indias and Vitaly Petrov. However they were continually the 'driver' who went out of the first qualifying with the three new teams.\nLong-term future.\nThe 2008 contract between the FIA and the Formula One teams outlawing customer cars starting in . Because of this, Red Bull put the Toro Rosso team up for sale in March 2008. They had hoped to sell the team by the end of the season. Until the team is sold, Toro Rosso will continue in its present form.On the 3rd of January 2011 rumours spread that a buyer had been found.\nSponsorship.\nSports sponsorship is a major part of Red Bull's marketing strategy. Scuderia Toro Rosso is not the first sports team to be bought and completely renamed. The same was done for Red Bull Racing (formerly Jaguar Racing), the Austrian football club Red Bull Salzburg (formerly \"SV Austria Salzburg\"), Austrian Ice Hockey team Red Bull Salzburg EC and MLS' Red Bull New York (previously \"Metrostars\").\nOther current sponsors and suppliers include Hangar-7, Volkswagen, Advanti Racing (wheel), USAG, Magneti Marelli, Advanti Racing, Siemens and Hexagon Metrology."}

He started Deere &amp; Company, which is a big company that makes farm equipment. In 1837, he invented the first successful steel plow. This worked better with the tough soil of the Midwestern United States.\nJohn Deere was born in Rutland, Vermont, on February 7, 1804. He was the third son of William Rinold Deere and Sarah Yates Deere. In 1805, the family moved to Middlebury, Vermont, John\u2019s father worked as a tailor. In 1808, William took a boat to England, because he hoped to claim an inheritance and make a more comfortable life for his family. He was never heard from again, and people think that he must have died at sea. John\u2019s mother, Sarah, only had a small of money to raise him. John Deere's education was limited to the elementary schools of Vermont. At the age of 17 he learned how to be a blacksmith, which took him to several places in Vermont.\nIn 1836, John traveled to Grand Detour, Illinois, to make a fresh start. He had married and nine young children to look after. John was smart and hard working and he easily found work as a blacksmith. There were lots of farmers in Illinois and John had to fix their plows. The new farmers in Illinois struggled to turn heavy, sticky prairie soil with cast iron plows designed for the light, sandy soil of Vermont. John thought about the steel needles he had seen in father\u2019s tailor shop. The needles stayed smooth and shiny because they were pulled through rough leather. John Deere came up with the idea for a plow that would work. The plow in his mind was polished and shiny and made of steel just like his father\u2019s tailoring needles. It was shaped so that it could scour itself as it cut furrows. In 1837, he created his plow using a broken saw blade.\nJohn sold his first plow to a farmer named Lewis Crandall. Lewis loved the plow told lots of other farmers. By 1841, John was making 100 of the plows every year. In 1843, he started working with another man named Leonard Andrus to help him keep up! By 1848, John had stopped working with Leonard and moved the business to Moline, Illinois. Moline had water power, coal and cheaper transportation than in Grand Detour. In 1850, John\u2019s company made 1600 plows. The company was soon producing other tools to go with the steel plow.\nIn 1858, John asked his son Charles to be in charge of the company. John stayed on as president of the company, but he also wanted to work on others things. He started a bank in Moline and joined a church. He was also the mayor of the city for two years and the director of the city library! John Deere died on May 17, 1886, at his home in Moline."}

It formed when Pangaea broke up, starting 180 million years ago (mya), in the early middle Jurassic. \nThe global supercontinent Pangaea was complete 250 million years ago. Then it split into two smaller supercontinents, which were about the same size. The northern part of Pangaea became Laurasia, and the southern part became Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana drifted south, while Laurasia moved north. \nGondwana included most of the landmasses in today's southern hemisphere, including Antarctica, South America, Africa, Madagascar, Australia\u2013New Guinea, and New Zealand. It also included Arabia and the Indian subcontinent, which have now moved entirely into the Northern Hemisphere. \nGondwana itself began to break up in the mid-Jurassic period, about 170 million years ago.\nHistory of the name.\nGondwana was named by an Austrian scientist, Eduard Suess. He named the supercontinent after the Gondwana region because some of the earliest rock formations of this continent were first investigated in part of the region, in modern Odisha.\nThe adjective Gondwanan is often used in biogeography to describe where different organisms live. It is most commonly used when the organisms only live in two or more of the now-separate regions that were once part of Gondwana, including the Antarctic flora. For example, the Proteaceae, a family of plants, lives only in southern South America, South Africa, and Australia. This is called a \"Gondwanan distribution\" (meaning that the Proteaceae live only in the areas that used to be part of Gondwana). This pattern shows that the Proteaceae have existed for a very long time since the time that Gondwana existed.\nEvidence of plant and animal distribution supported the ideas of two scientists: Alfred Russel Wallace and Alfred Wegener. Wallace explained geographical distribution as the result of evolution. Wegener used geographical distribution as evidence for continental drift.\nBreakup of Gondwana.\nBetween 160 and 23 million years ago, Gondwana broke up. Africa separated from Antarctica around 160 million years ago. Next, it separated from the Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous period (about 125 million years ago). \nAbout 65 million years ago, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, with marsupial fauna. About 40 million years ago, Australia-New Guinea separated from Antarctica. This allowed latitudinal currents to separate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear in Antarctica. \nDuring the Eocene-Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago, levels of carbon dioxide were about 760 parts per million. They had been decreasing from earlier levels, which were in the thousands of parts per million. \nAround 23 million years ago, the Drake Passage opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that completely isolated Antarctica. Models of the changes suggest that decreasing levels of carbon dioxide became more important. The ice began to spread through Antarctica, replacing the forests that had covered the continent. Since about 15 million years ago, Antarctica has been mostly covered with ice. Around six million years ago, the Antarctic ice cap reached the size it is today.\nSubmerged former lands.\nThere are several submerged (underwater) lands in the Indian Ocean, off the west of Australia. They are under more than of water. Their rocks show that they used to be part of Gondwana. They are not the type of rocks that are usually found in the ocean, like basalt. Instead, they are typical land rocks, like granite, sandstone, and gneiss. They also have the type of fossils that are now found on continental areas. Recently, two of these sunken islands were found to the west of Perth, Western Australia. These islands are almost the size of Tasmania, and have flat tops. This shows they were once at sea level before being submerged underwater. It also shows that when India began to break away from Australasia in the early Cretaceous period, the islands formed part of the last link between the two present-day continents.\nNaturaliste Plateau.\nThe Naturaliste Plateau is a submerged land off of Western Australia. It has an area of 90,000 square kilometres (34,749 square miles).\nThe Naturaliste Plateau may have deposits of oil. When it was above land during the Mesozoic era, it had a tropical climate which might have been perfect for creating coal, oil and natural gas.\nKerguelen microcontinent.\nThe Kerguelen Plateau is a submerged microcontinent in the southern Indian Ocean. It is about to the southwest of Australia, and extends for more than in a northwest-southeast direction. It is under deep water, but a small part of the plateau is above sea level, forming the Australian Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and the French Kerguelen Islands. The islands are part of a large igneous province (LIP) which started when Gondwana started to break up, 130 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous period. \nVolcanic activity occurs sometimes on the Heard and McDonald islands."}

Formula One leader Bernie Ecclestone wanted a race in the USSR, but was not able to make a deal with Moscow. A Hungarian friend of his recommended the city of Budapest. Formula One wanted a street circuit similar to the Circuit de Monaco to be built in the N\u00e9pliget, Budapest's largest park. The Hungarian government decided to build a new circuit (track) just outside the city near a major highway. Construction work started on October 1, 1985. the circuit was built in eight months, less time than any other Formula One circuit. The first race was held on March 24, 1986 in memory of J\u00e1nos Drap\u00e1l. Drap\u00e1l was the first Hungarian to win a Grand Prix motorcycle race.

The F1 race is normally held in the middle of a Central European summer. The circuit is generally dusty, which limits traction. This is because the track is not used very much throughout the season and it is built on sandy soil. The track is built in a natural valley. About 80 percent of the racetrack is visible from any viewing location.\nThe Hungaroring is a twisty style circuit, where passing difficult.\nThe Hungaroring is the home of Hungarian motorsport. Besides Formula One, there were also DTM, FIA GT Championship races in its history. A public drag race event takes place every month.\nFans.\nMost of the foreign fans are from Germany and Austria.

Very often, the physical model is smaller than the original (scale model). \nThere are three basic types of building models: architectural, structural and mathematical (virtual).\nArchitectural building model.\nAn architectural model is a type of a physical model of a structure to study an architectural design or to share design ideas to clients, committees, and the general public. Architectural models are a tool which may be used for show, presentation, fundraising, getting permits, and sale purposes. Such models are a good tool for three-dimensional understanding of a design, used by architects, interior designers and exhibit designers.\nStructural building model.\nEngineers who need scale models to test the likely performance of a design at an early stage of development without paying for a full-sized prototype.\nVirtual building model.\nVirtual model is a digital model of the object (typically greatly simplified) that can be used in a computer simulation or virtual reality.\nThe most common examples of virtual models are those created in 3D for the purpose of \"visualisation\" - seeing how the structure looks before it is built. The field of architecture has greatly popularized the use of virtual models to animate fly-throughs of yet-to-be-built buildings."}

They were allowed to join F1 as Manor Grand Prix on 12 June 2009. They were one of four new teams selected to race in the 2010 season. On 30 November, the FIA released a revised entry list that stated the team's name as Virgin Racing. Richard Branson's Virgin Group is the title sponsor of the team, which was launched on 15 December 2009.\nOn 11 November, Russian car builder Marussia Motors became the majority share owner in Virgin Racing. Marussia has been a partner to Virgin Racing since the team started in 2009. The team will be known as Marussia Virgin Racing. Marussia fully bought the team in 2012 and re branded it Marussia F1 with Virgin remaining as a sponsor.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe team was first formed as Manor Grand Prix as a partership between Manor Motorsport and Wirth Research.\nInitially, Virgin's Alex Tai was the Team Principal (person in charge).

CFD is computer program used to design a race car that will move through the air well. It is used to replace test models of cars in a wind tunnel to see how well they perform.\nOn 17 November 2009 Virgin announced that former Toyota driver Timo Glock would be the team's lead driver for the 2010 season. The driver has signed a two-year contract with a one-year extension offer. Long-time Brazilian GP2 regular Lucas di Grassi will join him.

Starting in 2010, cars cannot be refueled during the race. The Virgin cars would not be able to finish any races unless the drivers ran at a reduced speed to conserve fuel. The team has been allowed to redesign the chassis to increase the fuel tank size.\nThe team was not able to complete a full race with both cars until the Spanish Grand Prix, the fifth race of the season. The team finished last in 12 position.\n2011.\nDuring the warm-up just before the race, Timo Glock had a problem with his race car. Fifth gear in the transmission broke.

Virgin stated they were fully committed to the team and were remaining as a sponsor. Timo Glock remained as a driver and scored the teams highest finish(a 12th in Singapore). The team occupied 10th spot in the championship for the majority of the season but they were beaten in the final race by Caterham.

Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body. They make up three to eight percent of the leukocytes in the blood. \nMonocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to the tissues will then differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells, which then stay in the tissue. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances. They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm and many internal vesicles for processing foreign material.\nMonocytes and their macrophage and dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions in the immune system. These are phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine production."}

It includes the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, known as the Greco-Roman world. \nClassical antiquity is the period in which Greek and Roman literature (such as Aeschylus, Ovid, and others) flourished. By convention, the period starts with the works of Homer, (8th\u20137th century BC), and ends with the arrival of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire (5th\u20136th century AD).\nArchaic period (8th to 6th centuries BC).\nThe earliest period of classical antiquity took place before the re-appearance of historical sources after the Bronze Age collapse. The earliest Greek alphabetic inscriptions are in the first half of the 8th century. Homer is usually assumed to have lived in the 8th or 7th century, and his lifetime is often taken as marking the beginning of classical antiquity. The traditional date for the first Ancient Olympic Games, in 776 BC, was also around this time. In Roman legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC. The earliest settlement at the Roman Forum seems to have taken place around this time. \nPhoenicians.\nThe Phoenicians originally expanded from Levantine ports, by the 8th century dominating trade in the Mediterranean. Carthage was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in Sicily, Italy and Sardinia, which brought about conflicts of interest with Etruria.\nGreece.\nThe Archaic period followed the Greek Dark Ages, and saw the rise of democracy, philosophy, theatre, poetry, as well as the revitalisation of the written language (which had been lost during the Dark Ages).\nPottery styles of the later part of the Archaic age are the black-figure pottery, started in Corinth during the 7th century BC. Its successor was the red-figure style, developed by the Andokides in about 530 BC.\nClassical Greece (5th to 4th centuries BC).\nThe classical period of Ancient Greece was from the fall of the Athenian tyranny in 510 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. During this period came the long struggle between Sparta and Athens, and the wars between the Greeks and the Persians. The rise of Macedon in the 4th century overturned all other political systems, at least for a while.\nHellenistic period (330 to 146 BC).\nThe Hellenistic period began with Alexander, when Greek became the \"lingua franca\" far beyond Greece itself, and Hellenistic culture came in contact with the cultures of Persia, Central Asia, India and Egypt. \nThe Hellenistic period ended with the rise of the Roman Republic to a super-regional power in the 2nd century BC and the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC.\nRoman Republic (5th to 1st centuries BC).\nThe Roman Forum was the central area around which ancient Rome developed.\nThe republican period of Ancient Rome began with the overthrow of the Monarchy at about 509 BC and lasted over 450 years until its subversion, through a series of civil wars and the Imperial period. \nRoman Empire (1st century BC to 5th century AD).\nDetermining the precise end of the Republic is a matter of dispute. Roman citizens of the time did not recognize that the Republic had ceased to exist. \nIt could be said that Rome was already of imperial character. It had no emperor when it conquered Gaul, Illyria, Greece Hispania, and the Roman province of Asia.\nLate Antiquity (4th to 6th centuries AD).\nDuring Late Antiquity Christianity rose under Constantine I, and finally became the Roman imperial cult in 393. Successive invasions of Germanic tribes meant the end of the Western Empire in the 5th century, but the Eastern Empire persisted throughout the Middle Ages as the Byzantine Empire.\nRevivalism.\nRespect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected politics, philosophy, sculpture, literature, theater, education, architecture and even sexuality.\nIn politics, the presence of a Roman Emperor was felt to be desirable long after the empire fell. This tendency reached its peak when Charlemagne was crowned \"Roman Emperor\" in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire. The notion that an emperor is a monarch who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized western world."}

He was also soon suspected in the death of Kennedy as well.\nSoon after he was arrested, Oswald talked to reporters in a hallway. Oswald shouted, \"I didn't shoot anybody,\" and, \"They've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!\" (a scapegoat or someone who is blamed for something someone else actually did). Later, at a press meeting, a reporter asked, \"Did you kill the President?\" and Oswald answered, \"No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question.\" As he was led from the room the question was called out, \"What did you do in Russia?\" and, \"How did you hurt your eye?\"; Oswald answered, \"A policeman hit me.\"\nTwo days later, while being moved from police headquarters to the county jail, Oswald was shot and mortally wounded by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, in full view of television cameras broadcasting live.\nWarren Commission study.\nIn 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy, a conclusion reached previously by the FBI and Dallas Police. In 1979, The United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations agreed that Kennedy was killed by Oswald, but also concluded Kennedy`s death was probably as a result of a conspiracy. The members of this probable conspiracy were not identified.\nFamily history.\nOswald had been born in New Orleans, 2 months after his father died, and his mother moved him and 2 brothers to several different towns, while marrying a third husband for 3 years, 1945-48. After attending 12 schools, around Fort Worth, New York City, and New Orleans, Oswald dropped out of 10th grade, at age 16, and worked as a office clerk/messenger. Moving back to Texas in July 1956, Oswald entered 10th grade in Fort Worth, but quit school again, at age 17 in October, to join the U.S. Marines, as had his brother Robert, after their half-brother John Pic joined the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1959, Oswald received a hardship discharge (for mother's health) to quit the Marines, but defected to the Soviet Union, for nearly 3 years. Having married Marina, the daughter of a Soviet security official, he re-defected back to the U.S. with her and their daughter, in June 1962.\nThey settled in Dallas, with his mother and brother Robert. Oswald worked 3 months in a welding company, then worked in a printing shop from October until being fired in April 1963. Oswald was later suspected of the April 10 attempt to shoot General Edwin Walker, using a rifle (and handgun) he received through mail-order in March. Oswald and Marina quickly moved to New Orleans in April, but she returned to Dallas in late September 1963, when he traveled to Mexico with failed plans to go to Cuba and the USSR. Instead, he returned to Dallas and began working at the Texas School Book Depository on October 16, 1963. The FBI was investigating Marina as a possible Soviet spy. That was one month before the shootings of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.\nLater, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, \"Did you kill the President?\" and Oswald \u2013 who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death \u2013 answered, his voice breaking, \"No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question.\" A reporter informed Oswald that he had been charged. Oswald reacted with a look of dismay. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mbSKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=Oswald%27s+voice+cracks+nervously+astonishment+charged+Vincent+Bugliosi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1-c32vw1UZ&amp;sig=ACfU3U11Bck6DqLEs4DH6iHIPY9v8BnY-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN5fW6mfDzAhXT_rsIHVQXA2IQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Oswald's%20voice%20cracks%20nervously%20astonishment%20charged%20Vincent%20Bugliosi&amp;f=false\nOswald died on November 24, 1963, from gunshot wound by Jack Ruby. He was survived by his wife Marina, 2-year-old daughter June, and 1-month-old daughter Rachel. \na cry of anguish from Oswald Oswald slumped to the concrete paving, as his manacled hands clutched at his abdomen and writhing with pain, moaning. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter The crowd outside the headquarters burst into applause when they heard that Oswald had been shot. a police detective Billy Combest suddenly recognized Ruby and exclaimed: \"Jack, you son of a bitch!\" A moaning Oswald was carried back into the basement level jail office. Combest asked Oswald, \u201cDo you have anything you want to tell us now?\u201d Oswald shook his head. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter.\nPrayer man.\nResearchers Greg Parker and Sean Murphy have given attention to a man standing on the Depository front steps in the Wiegman and Darnell films during the assassination, called \"Prayer Man\", named as the man is holding his hands in front of him as if praying. It has been suggested that Oswald was the figure, and Oswald\u2019s wife, Marina also expressed her belief. Researchers have argued that the official record of Marrion Baker and Roy Truly encountering Oswald in the TSBD second floor lunchroom was false and point to an account where Baker originally said he saw a man walking away from a stairway on the 3rd or 4th floor, and Baker testifying taking the 5th floor elevator only just \u201cone or two floors up\u201d after his official Oswald encounter on the second floor, indicating there was a 4th floor encounter. Also noted that on the day of the assassination, Truly was overheard by reporter Kent Biffle, informing Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) that he had seen Oswald in \u201ca storage room on the first floor\u201d. Occhus Campbell (the vice President of the TSBD) also told the New York Herald Tribune the same day that he saw Oswald \u201cshortly after the shooting\u201d in the first floor storage room. Fritz even wrote that Truly saw Oswald \u201cimmediately after the shooting somewhere near the back stairway\u201d. The storage room on the first floor was located near the back stairway. In addition, notes taken down by FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty and Fritz during the first interrogations of Oswald on November 22, indicate that when Oswald was asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, he claimed that he \u201cwent outside to watch P. Parade\u201d (referring to the presidential motorcade), and that he was \u201cout with [William Shelley, a foreman at the depository] in front\u201d. According to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald said that he was at the \u201cfront entrance to the first floor\u201d when he encountered a policeman who told him to \u201cstep aside\u201d."}

People may be moved into a county jail immediately after they are arrested, or may later be transferred to a county jail from a local holding cell or detention center. In smaller counties, there may be a single jail facility. Larger, more populated counties will often operate more than one jail at locations throughout the county.\nWho spends time in jail.\nCounty jails usually hold people under the following circumstances:\nJails may also hold key trial witnesses for criminal cases, known as \"material witnesses\", who have been found by a court to be unlikely to appear to testify if not detained, and people who have been charged with crimes in other states who are being held for extradition proceedings.\nAlthough it is unusual, some people charged with crimes might wait in a county jail for a year or longer, awaiting a criminal trial, while unable to bond out by posting \"bail\" (depending on the nature of the criminal charges against them).\nAfter a defendant is convicted of a crime, he or she may be sentenced to prison. When that occurs, the defendant will usually be held in the county jail until he or she can be taken into the custody of the state's prison system. U.S. prison populations include many \"hardened criminals\" who have been convicted of a significant crime or series of crimes, while a county jail might contain many people who have not yet been convicted and are thus presumed innocent, first-time offenders, who do not have a severe criminal mindset, along with more serious offenders who have not yet been convincted or sentenced, or are awaiting transfer to prison.\nOperation of jails.\nIn most states, each county jail is maintained by a \"sheriff's department\" run by the current county sheriff and his deputy officers. The County Sheriff's department is a police agency with county-wide jurisdiction, separate from the city or town police departments, within a county.\nIn order to protect the legal rights of inmates, both for their own safety and the safety of others, a county jail will have some private cells to hold especially violent or controversial suspects, to protect others from them or them from being targeted by the \"general population\" of the jail, as well as to observe inmates who may want to harm themselves. Also, a county jail will be subject to medical or health restrictions, such as providing medical care or Kosher foods, in order to ensure the health of inmates and to respect their civil rights.\nFor those reasons, a county jail is often very different, as to both structure and occupants, from a prison."}
{"id": "256799", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256799", "title": "Sheriff", "text": "A sheriff is generally a legal official with responsibility for a county or parish. The duties of a sheriff vary from country to country. The term comes from Anglo-Norman English. The kings officer in each shire was called a \"shire-reeve\". His function was to enforce the king's law in the shire or county. \nHistory.\nThe term shire reeve appears in documents in England in the early 11th century. When William the Conqueror conquered England in 1066, he kept most of the Anglo-Saxon sheriffs. When William abolished the great Anglo-Saxon Earldoms, the sheriff became the immediate representative of the king in the county. His appointment was typically for one year. He held court where he punished minor offenders. Later, his powers were reduced to arresting and imprisoning criminals. \nColonial America.\nWhen the American colonies began to grow, Britain established political control. As each colony established counties, a sheriff was appointed to keep law and order. He was also an officer of the British court. The sheriff had different titles in different colonies. In Rhode Island he was called a general sergeant. In Connecticut and Massachusetts the title was Marshal. In Plymouth Colony he was called a messenger. In the later colonial period, sheriffs were appointed by the colonial governor. They collected taxes, testified in court and served subpoenas. Because they were paid per task, and tax collecting paid the most, enforcing the law became a lower priority.\nAfter the American Revolutionary War sheriffs were elected by the people.\n17th and 18th century America.\nIn the American west, the Spanish were colonizing what would become Texas, California. The equivalent of the sheriff was called an Alguacil (sheriff/constable). As Americans moved west, they often started new communities. A sheriff was usually the only available law enforcement. Sheriffs had the power of \"posse comitatus\". That means a sheriff had the power to deputize anyone to help him keep the peace or go after and arrest criminals. A group of temporary deputies under the authority of a sheriff is called a posse. As America grew the posse was used less and less. Sheriffs are still the main law enforcement in rural areas. \nModern sheriffs.\nUnited States.\nIn many states the sheriff remains the highest ranking county law enforcement officer. Each state decides what powers the sheriff will have. In some states the sheriff is a court officer and law enforcement is left to the police. In other states they are charged with enforcing laws, investigate crimes, transport prisoners and operate jails. A sheriff can appoint deputies. A small sheriff's department might be run by a sheriff alone. A large sheriff's department could have hundreds of deputies and civilian employees. The main difference between a sheriff's office and a police department is that the sheriff usually operates correctional facilities and county civil functions.\nAustralia.\nSheriffs were appointed, as early as 1829 in Western Australia, as a court official. Duties included collecting taxes and fines."}

It is made by Philip Morris USA (a branch of Altria) within the US, and by Philip Morris International (now separate from Altria) outside the US. It is famous for its billboard advertisements and magazine ads of the Marlboro Man.\nMotorsport sponsorship.\nFormula One.\nMarlboro is also known for its sponsorship of auto racing. This started in with its sponsorship of Formula One teams BRM and Iso Marlboro-Ford.\nFor season Marlboro ended its sponsorship of both teams. Marlboro became associated with the McLaren team. Marlboro ended their sponsorship of McLaren in , which ended the famous red and white McLaren livery.\nMarlboro also sponsored Scuderia Ferrari as secondary sponsor starting in 1980s Ferrari company president Enzo Ferrari refused to allow \"outside\" sponsor brands to appear on his team cars. After Enzo Ferrari's death in 1988, Marlboro began to take over as the primary sponsor. Later the team was officially named Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro.\nIn September 2005, Ferrari signed an extension of their sponsorship arrangement with Marlboro until 2011. This came at a time when tobacco sponsorship was being banned in many location. It had become illegal in the European Union, including F1 races. Other major teams have withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies. In April 2008, the Marlboro logo was displayed on the Ferrari for the last time.\nMarlboro then replaced the logo with a variety of barcodes. Leading health officials called for a review of the barcode advertising. The Ferrari team claims the barcode is part of the car design, not an advertising message. The controversial barcode designed was recently removed by Ferrari for the start of the Spanish Grand Prix.\nMarlboro also sponsored the Alfa Romeo Formula One team between and .\nOther racing series.\nSince their start in Formula One, Marlboro has also sponsored numerous teams and races.\nMarlboro sponsorship in Champ Car (also known as 'CART' and 'IndyCar' at that time) dates back to 1986. The Penske cars in the Indy Racing League (IRL) currently run in Marlboro's distinctive red and white colors. In 2006, a Marlboro-sponsored car won the Indianapolis 500. For the 2007 season, Marlboro had ended their sponsorship of the Penske Cars. The Penske team will retain the color scheme. Where 'Marlboro Penske' appeared on the side of the cars, 'Team Penske' replaced it. Although Marlboro does not sponsor Team Penske, Philip Morris USA is still Team Penske's main sponsor.\nMarlboro also sponsored the Australian Marlboro Holden Dealer Team from 1974 through to 1984. The Marlboro branding gave rise to some of Australia's most prominently recognizable race cars such as the L34 and A9X Torana, as well as the VK Group C \"Big Banger\" Commodore.\nIn Motorcycling Grand Prix, Marlboro sponsored the Yamaha team in 500cc and 250cc class. Marlboro currently sponsors the Ducati MotoGP. As of the 2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, they are only allowed to put the Marlboro brand the bikes in Qatar.\nMarlboro also has a long history in rallying sponsorship, including with the factory World Rally Championship teams of Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Peugeot. During the 2007 GP2 Series Season, ART Grand Prix was also sponsored by Marlboro.\nMarlboro are generally credited as being among the most important of sponsors to the world of Formula 1 (and motor racing in general) in terms of the amount of financial backing given to various competitors. In mid-2006, special \"racing editions\" of Marlboro Red were sold in the UK, with a Ferrari-inspired design, although the Ferrari name and badge were not used."}

It was written by McCartney, though the songwriting credit is Lennon/McCartney.\nStructure.\nThe vaudevillian-style song is about medical student Maxwell Edison, who uses his silver hammer to murder his girlfriend Joan, then his teacher, and finally the judge during his murder trial. Despite the grim subject matter, the song is bouncy and upbeat (a \"happy song about a serial killer\").\nMeaning.\nMcCartney said in 1994 that it symbolizes the failures of life:\nMcCartney referred to the song when talking about his 2005 album \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\":\n\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" is a song by The Beatles, from the \"Abbey Road\" album, with Paul McCartney singing lead. It was written by McCartney, though the songwriting credit is Lennon/McCartney.\nRecording.\nAfter resuming to record the \"Abbey Road\" album, the Beatles began recording Maxwell's Silver Hammer at Abbey Road Studios on 9 July 1969. McCartney, Harrison and Starr taped 16 takes of the song, followed by a series of guitar overdubs.\nThe following two days the group overdubbed vocals, piano, Hammond organ, anvil and guitar. The song was completed on 6 August, when McCartney recorded a solo on a Moog synthesizer.\nJohn Lennon later said, \"I hate it...He did everything to make it into a single, and it never was and it never could have been.\"\nGeorge Harrison described it in 1969 as \"one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some people hate, and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge.\" In 1977 Harrison was more candid, describing it as \"so fruity\" but added \"we did a good job on it\". \nThe length of time it took to record the song created tension between the Beatles. Paul McCartney said: \"The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' - 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.' It was early-days Moog work and it did take a bit of time\".\nPersonnel.\nFor the studio version of the song, the anvil was played by Starr; in the Beatles film \"Let It Be\", however, Mal Evans is seen hitting the anvil as the Beatles play the track."}

Darling' I came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week.\"\nIn a 1980 interview with \"Playboy\" magazine, John Lennon said, \"'Oh! Darling' was a great one of Paul's that he didn't sing too well. I always thought I could have done it better\u2014it was more my style than his. He wrote it, so what the hell, he's going to sing it.\"\nGeorge Harrison described the song as \"a typical 1950s\u2013'60s-period song because of its chord structure.\"\n\"Let It Be\" session.\nAfter an early attempt at this song on 27 January 1969 during the \"Let It Be\" sessions, Lennon announced, \"Just heard that Yoko's divorce has just gone through\", after which he and the band burst into an improvised version of the song, singing \"I'm free at last\" instead of a part of the lyric."}

Harrison said: \"'Octopus's Garden' is Ringo's song. It's only the second song Ringo has ever written, mind you, and it's lovely.\" He added that the song gets very deep into your mind \"because it's so peaceful. I suppose Ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it.\"\nBackground.\nRingo Starr got the idea for the song when he was on a boat owned by comedian Peter Sellers in Sardinia in 1968. He ordered fish and chips for lunch, but instead of fish he got squid. It was the first time he'd eaten squid, and he said, \"It was OK. A bit rubbery. Tasted like chicken.\" The boat's captain told Ringo how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects to build gardens. The \"Let It Be\" movie had a scene where George Harrison is shown helping Ringo Starr work the song out on piano.\nThe song, which contains the words \"Oh what joy for every girl and boy / Knowing they're happy and they're safe,\" is sometimes thought of as being a song for children, like \"Yellow Submarine\", \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" or \"All Together Now\". It has been performed by the Muppets several times in their shows.\nRecording.\nThe basic instrumental track was recorded April 26, 1969, with two electric guitars (Harrison and John Lennon), bass guitar (Paul McCartney), and drums (Starr). George Martin did not produce the song, so the Beatles themselves were listed as producer, with Martin's assistant Chris Thomas present in the control room to help. Thirty-two takes were needed before the Beatles were happy with the song.\nThe backing vocals by McCartney and Harrison during the guitar solo were put through compressors and limiters to create a gurgling sound. Harrison added the sound of bubbles being blown into a glass of milk using a straw."}

John Lennon did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a car crash. Towards the end of the session, Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part. Harrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret, resulting the final key of A major. He also used the same technique on his 1965 song \"If I Needed Someone,\" which shares a similar melodic pattern. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound.\nA harmonium and handclaps were added on July 16. Harrison's guitar solo was overdubbed on 6 August, and the orchestral parts were added on 15 August. \"Here Comes the Sun\" was completed four days later with the addition of Harrison's Moog synthesizer part."}

At that time, in the port cities of the Ottoman empire there lived very many Italian speakers. \"Franca\" was the Italian word for \"Frankish\". Its usage in the term \"lingua franca\" came from its meaning in Arabic. That word came into use before the Crusades, when Europeans used to be called \"Franks\" or \"Faranji\" in Arabic. The term \"lingua franca\" is first recorded in English in 1678.\nExamples.\nThere are many languages in all continents that are used as lingua franca.\nIn Africa: Afrikaans, Berber, Fanagalo, Fula, Hausa, Krio, Manding, Sango, Swahili, Wolof\nIn Asia: Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic, Azeri, Bengali, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi-Urdu, Malay-Indonesian, Nepali, Persian, Sanskrit\nIn Europe: English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, Polish,\nPortuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Yiddish\nIn Pre-Columbian America: Chinook Jargon, Nahuatl, Quechua, Tupi\nPidgins and creoles: Guinea-Bissau Creole, Tok Pisin\nAll continents : Esperanto as an auxiliary lingua franca\nFor some of them some explanations may be given.\nEnglish.\nEnglish is the current \"lingua franca\" of international business, science, technology and aviation. It has replaced French as the lingua franca of diplomacy since World War II. The rise of English in diplomacy began in 1919, after World War I, when the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as in French. The use of English profited from the important international role of English-speaking nations (the United States and the Commonwealth of Nations) after World War II, particularly in the establishment and organization of the United Nations. English is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (the other five are French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish).\nWhen the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English was the \"lingua franca\" of the colonies of the British Empire. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations which had many indigenous languages decided to continue using English as the lingua franca to avoid the political difficulties that had developed if one had decided to use only one of the indigenous languages.\nFrench.\nFrench was the language of diplomacy in Europe from the 13th century, and as a result is still a working language of international institutions and is seen on documents ranging from passports to airmail letters. For many years, until the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark joined in 1973, French and German were the only official working languages of the European Economic Community. French was also the lingua franca of European literature in the 18th century.\nGerman.\nGerman was a \"lingua franca\" in large portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the Holy Roman Empire.\nAs it was one of the official languages of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, German remained an important second language in much of Central and Eastern Europe long after World War I. Today, it is still the most common second language in some of the countries in the region (e.g. in Slovenia (45% of the pop.), Croatia (34%), the Czech Republic (31%) and Slovakia (28%)). In others, it is also known by significant numbers of the population (in Poland by 18%, in Hungary by 16%).\nGreek and Latin.\nDuring the time of the Roman Empire, the \"lingua franca\"s were Greek and Latin. During the Middle Ages, the \"lingua franca\" was Greek in the parts of Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa where the Byzantine Empire had much influence, and Latin was used in the rest of Europe. Latin was used as the common language of the Roman Catholic Church. During the Second Vatican Council, Catholic liturgy changed to local languages, although Latin remains the official language of the Vatican. Latin was used as the language of scholars in Europe until the early 19th century in most subjects."}

Having not won a single Grand Prix race, the team was sold to BMW in 2005. The team competed as BMW Sauber from 2006 to 2009, and won one race. At the end of the 2009 season, BMW deceided to leave Formula One.\nThe race team's future was uncertain for several months. BMW sold the team back to Peter Sauber which allowed the team to race in entry. Due to issues with the Formula One contract, the team name will remain BMW Sauber for the 2010 season.\nSports cars.\nSince the 1970s, Peter Sauber built sports cars. After using turbocharged Mercedes V8 engines in the 1980s, his team became the official factory team of Mercedes-Benz, reviving the Silver Arrow legend. They won the 24 hours of Le Mans and the World Sportscar Championship in 1989 and 1990, competing against Jaguar and Porsche.\nFormula One.\nThe Mercedes era (1993\u20131994).\nMercedes-Benz had planed to enter Formula One with Sauber. They could not work out all the details, so Mercedes withdrew their formal support. Mercedes continued to fund Sauber's Formula One project unofficially. The Sauber team was powered by V10 Ilmor engines in a chassis named the C12. This continued the Sauber's naming policy from the sports car days. The 'C' was a reference to Peter Sauber's wife, Christine. The cars were driven by JJ Lehto and Karl Wendlinger.\nThe Sauber racing debut took place in the first race of the season in South Africa. The car finished in fifth place, earning two points under the scoring system at the time. Over the remainder of the season the team rarely saw the finish of a race due to unreliability and racing accidents. When the team did finish a race, they were often in the top ten. Sauber ended the season with twelve points, seventh out of the thirteen original entries.\nThe team competed in the season as Sauber Mercedes, now officially Mercedes' factory team. Their new car was the Sauber C13 and the Ilmor engine was re-badged (given a new name) as the Mercedes 3.5 V10. Former Sauber sports car driver Heinz Harald Frentzen was Karl Wendlinger's new teammate.\nEarly performance was disappointingly, delivering similar results as the previous year. They only scoring a few points in the opening rounds. Things got worse after the tragic deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix. Wendlinger was seriously injured in a crash during practice for the Monaco Grand Prix. He suffered serious head injuries and was unable to race for the of the season. Wendlinger was replaced by Andrea de Cesaris. After Lehto had been released by Benetton, he drove for Sauber the last two races of the season.\nSauber finished the season with twelve points and eighth out of the fourteen original teams entered. Mercedes were unhappy with the progress of Sauber and left the team at the end of the year.\nThe Ford era (1995\u20131996).\nFor , Sauber start the beginning of a ten-year sponsorship deal with energy drink giant Red Bull. Dietrich Mateschitz had purchased a majority share in the team. Fritz Kaiser joined the team as the commercial director. The Sauber C14 used a factory supply of Ford-Cosworth. The 1995 season saw the return of Karl Wendlinger and Heinz Harald Frentzen as the drivers. Wendlinger's accident in 1994 seemed to have reduced his driving potential and he was replaced rookie Jean-Christophe Boullion.\nThe team finished on a record 18 points despite the under-performing Ford engine. They also climbed back up to seventh in the constructor's championship.\nIn 1995, Petronas become Sauber's presenting sponsor. They renewed their association in 2007, by which time the team had changed ownership.\n saw Sauber's worst Formula One season in terms of points. They had a promising driver lineup with Heinz Harald Frentzen and Johnny Herbert, a revised C15 car and a new V10 engine from Ford. They held seventh spot on a shrinking list of constructors and only scored 11 points. For the next season they announced a customer deal to receive Ferrari V10 engines. They also were working with new sponsors Petronas to build their own engines. Unfortunately, due to a major economic crash in Asia, the engines were never completed.\nThe Ferrari era (1997\u20132005).\nSauber used Ferrari designed engines from 1997 to 2005. They were built by Sauber Petronas Engineering, a company founded for purpose of building these engines. The engines were nearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari. Sauber Petronas Engineering also built the gearboxes used by Sauber. Sauber licensed nearly every part they could from Ferrari. Sauber even had several Ferrari engineers on staff. Suspicious similarities between Ferrari and Sauber chassis were pointed out, but no formal accusations were ever made. The FIA rules require each team to design their own chassis.\nIn Sauber brought a virtually unknown and very inexperienced Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen into Formula One. There were protests by a few drivers and members of the FIA, including Max Mosley. They believed R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen would pose a danger to other drivers. His good performance that year proved the Sauber decision right. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen would later go on to win the Drivers Championship with Ferrari.\nIn its later years, Sauber's ties with Ferrari became weaker. They sided with the other teams over planned rule changes. Then they decided to switch to Michelin tyres, while Ferrari continued to use Bridgestones. Sauber's final grand prix came in China. Sauber departed F1 with their best results; six third places and two front row starts.\nAmong the notable Sauber drivers were Jean Alesi, Formula One championship runner-up Felipe Massa, Johnny Herbert and World Champion Jacques Villeneuve. Two former Sauber drivers, Nick Heidfeld and Jacques Villeneuve, drove for the new BMW Sauber team in 2006. BMW ownership of Sauber started on January 1, 2006.\nThe BMW era (BMW Sauber, 2006\u20132009).\nAt the end of the 2005 season the team was bought by BMW and was renamed BMW Sauber.

Because of their contract with Formula One, the team still formally uses the name 'BMW Sauber' in competitions for .\nFor the season the team signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be their lead driver, and retained Jacques Villeneuve as the second driver. Polish Robert Kubica was signed as the team's third or test driver. The team continued to use Sauber's facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing. BMW's headquarters in Munich was responsible for building the new P86 V8 engine.\nFormer Sauber title sponsor Petronas renewed their contract with the new team, as a simple team sponsor, as did Credit Suisse. BMW Sauber announced a technical partnership with Intel and the Germany company O2, saying that it will lead to technological improvements on BMW road cars. The new livery (paint scheme), unveiled in Valencia on 17 January 2006, was the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red.\nAt the Hungarian Grand Prix, Heidfeld scored the team's first podium. Kubica filled in for Villeneuve. Villeneuve could not drive due to complications following his accident at the German Grand Prix. Kubica finished seventh, but was disqualified for having too light a car. Kubica would drive for the rest of the season, bringing an to Villeneuve's F1 career.\nThe team's finished the season fifth place in the constructor's championship with 36 points.\nFor the season Kubica and Heidfeld were again the teams' drivers. Sebastian Vettel would be the third or test driver. Timo Glock was signed as the team's second test driver.\nThe performance of the BMW Sauber's F1.08 firmly placed them as the best team behind the two championship leading teams of Ferrari and McLaren.\nThe Canadian Grand Prix brought the teams best finish to date, with Nick Heidfeld finishing in 2nd place, but Robert Kubica had a huge crash that resulted in a sprained ankle and concussion.\nSebastian Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix and finishing in 8th place. He became the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point. After the European Grand Prix, Scuderia Toro Rosso announced that Vettel would take the second driver seat from Scott Speed.\nOn August 21, 2007, BMW confirmed its driver line-up of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica for the season. Their 2008 car, the BMW Sauber F1.08 was officially launched in Munich on January 14, 2008.\nIn Bahrain, Kubica scored his and the team's first ever pole position, beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race, equaling their highest round of points scored. For the first time, the team was in first place in the constructors' championship.\nBMW Sauber's first race victory came in the Canadian Grand Prix. BMS Sauber scored a one-two finish with Robert Kubica's first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. This was the first Formula One victory for a BMW engine since the Williams-BMW won the Brazilian Grand Prix.\nAfter the team's breakthrough win, the team stopped improving the current car. They started work on the new car for because of the new regulations for the next season. This was reflected in the team's performance for the remainder of the 2008 season. Kubica was leading the drivers championship after the Canadian Grand Prix. The lack of development was shown with a drop in performance through the second half of the season. BMW was outpaced by Renault, Toyota and Toro Rosso\nIn October 2008 the team confirmed that they would stay with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the Season.\nAlthough BMW Sauber targeted the 2009 season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was disappointing. Kubica was in 3rd place in the opening round, when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place. Kubica was forced to retire from the race. Heidfeld secured the team's first podium of the year in Malaysia, but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected only 6 points. They were in 8th place in the Constructors' Championship out of 10 teams.\nSeveral upgrades were scheduled for Turkey, including an improved energy recovery braking system (KERS) and a new air diffuser to improve downforce and traction. While the new diffuser was installed, the KERS would not fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. BMW had been one of the strongest supports of KERS. After the British Grand Prix, the team announced they would stop development KERS. They set their focus on improving the car's aerodynamics (how well the car moves through the air). This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the team's first points since the race in Turkey.\nOn July 28, the company announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009. BMW Chairman Dr. Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one. On 15 September 2009 BMW Sauber announced they had a buyer for the team, Qadbak Investments Limited. Qadbak turned to be a shell company (a company without any real assets or operations), and the deal fell apart.\nLotus Racing was given the 13th and final slot in the Season.\nReturn to Sauber ownership and Ferrari engines (2010).\nOn November 27, 2009 Peter Sauber announced he would purchase the team back from BMW. He would only agree to the purchase if the team receiving a FIA entry for the season.\nOn December 3, 2009, the FIA confirmed that Sauber had been granted the entry position left by Toyota's departure from Formula one. The new Sauber team would be using Ferrari engines, and the team's chassis for the 2010 season would be designated Sauber C29. Peter Sauber said that he has not applied to change the name of the team, so they remain for now as \"BMW Sauber F1 Team\" despite using no BMW components.\nKamui Kobayashi was signed as a driver for the 2010 season on the December 17, 2009. Pedro de la Rosa was signed as Sauber's second driver on January 19, 2010. Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez has joined the team as an observer for some race weekends. He has been placed on the same training program as the race drivers de la Rosa and Kobayashi.\nThe team struggled in the early rounds of the season, and did not score any points from the first three races. Peter Sauber admitted at this point that his decision to rescue the team had been emotionally-driven, but insisted that it was a correct decision.\nThe team ran without a primary sponsor for the first four races of the 2010 season. For the Spanish and European Grand Prix, they carried the logo of the Spanish arm of the Burger King fast food franchise.\nIn Turkey, Kobayashi qualified in the top ten for the race, then finished 10th, collecting the team's first point in 2010.\nOn 14 September, Sauber announced that Nick Heidfeld had been signed to replace de la Rosa for the rest of the 2010 season. Heidfeld drove for Sauber from to , and to . Heidfeld will race starting with the Singapore Grand Prix.\n2011.\nFor the season, Sauber kept driver Kamui Kobayashi, and added rookie driver Sergio P\u00e9rez. Kobayashi qualified in 9th place, and P\u00e9rez in 13th. P\u00e9rez received praise for making his tyres last better than any other driver. He needed only one pit stop, when all other drivers needed at least two. They both finished the race in the points. P\u00e9rez finished in 7th place, and Kobayashi in 8th. The two Sauber cars were disqualified after the race. The team had made a mistake with the rear wing, and it was not legal.\nP\u00e9rez suffered a serious crash in the Monaco race. He had intentions of being in the next race, at Canada, and ran in the Friday practice. However, P\u00e9rez fell ill (sick) and was replaced by Pedro de la Rosa."}
{"id": "257026", "revid": "578140", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257026", "title": "Lawrence, Kansas", "text": "Lawrence is a city in Douglas County in the state of Kansas in the United States. It is in the northeastern part of the state, near the Kansas City area. It is the county seat of Douglas County. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 94,934. This makes it the sixth-biggest city in Kansas. The University of Kansas and Haskell Indian Nations University are in Lawrence.\nThe New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) created Lawrence in 1854. It is named after Amos Adams Lawrence, who gave financial support to the city. During Bleeding Kansas, Lawrence was where the Wakarusa War (1855) and the Sack of Lawrence (1856) happened. Lawrence is also the site of the Lawrence Massacre (1863) which happened during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865).\nLawrence started as an important place for free-state politics. After that, Lawrence's economy grew to be in many industries. These industries include agriculture, manufacturing, and education. Lawrence is called a \"college town\" because the University of Kansas is an important part of the city. There are many places in town where students like to go.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBefore the creation of the Kansas Territory, the area was part of the Shawnee Reservation. The Shawnee reservation was created in 1830. Most of eastern Kansas was in the reservation. In 1854, it became part of the Kansas Territory. The Oregon Trail went through the area. People on the Oregon Trail used a hill called \"Hogback Ridge\" to help guide them. Today, Hogback Ridge is called \"Mount Oread.\"\nIn the first half of the 1800s, there were many arguments about slavery in the United States. During this time, every time a free state (a state where slavery was illegal) was added into the country, a slave state (a state where slavery was allowed) had to be added too. The Missouri Compromise continued to let this happen. As a compromise to people arguing about new states being free or slave, Senator Lewis Cass and Senator Stephen A. Douglas promoted the idea of \"popular sovereignty.\" That meant the people in the area would decide to have slavery or not (instead of politicians in Washington deciding). Popular sovereignty was a big part of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act. That law undid the Missouri Compromise in practice. The Kansas-Nebraska Act also created the Kansas Territory and the Nebraska Territory.\nAfter the law passed, anti-slavery people were worried that the Kansas Territory would become a slave state. This is because the state next to Kansas is Missouri, which was a slave state. People believed that the first settlers in Kansas would be from Missouri. To stop Missouri from influencing Kansas, anti-slavery people from around the United States came to Kansas. These people wanted to make Kansas a free state. These people were called \"free-staters.\" The New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) helped anti-slavery people move to Kansas. It sent two men named Charles L. Robinson and Charles H. Branscomb to explore the land. They would decide a good place to send people. They saw Hogback Ridge, and they liked it because it was close to the Oregon Trail. They told the NEEAC to send people to this place.\nWhile Robinson and Branscomb were exploring, the NEEAC was getting people to move to Kansas. The NEEAC wanted to send a big group of people to claim the land. However, a cholera outbreak in the Missouri Valley stopped this from happening. The NEEAC was able to get a small group of only 29 men to go. They left Boston, Massachusetts on July 17, 1854. Many people in Boston were happy to see them do this, and they hoped they would do well. In late July, the group came to St. Louis and met Charles Robinson. He gave them transportation and told them what to do. They came to the Kansas Territory in late July. They ate their first meal on Hogback Ridge on August 1, 1854. After they had eaten, half of them left to claim the land around them. The other half stayed on Hogback Ridge. They began putting up their tents between Mount Oread and the Kansas River (close to where Massachusetts Street is). This was the start of the city.\nFour weeks later, Robinson and Samuel C. Pomeroy led a second group of 67 people from Worcester, Massachusetts on August 31. While they were going to Kansas, other anti-slavery people joined them. When they came to Lawrence on September 911, their group had 114 people. This group had about ten women, some children, and some musicians. A third group came on October 8-9. However, many of them \"became disgusted\" by the settlement because it did not look good, and they went back to New England. Many felt the NEEAC tricked them. A fourth group came on October 30, a fifth group on November 20, and a sixth group on December 1.\nOn September 18, 1854, the people of Lawrence made a government. On September 20, they wrote a constitution which did not allow slavery. The people of Lawrence wrote this constitution even though other people near them wanted slavery. On September 30, the people of Lawrence came together to protect Thomas J. Ferril, an anti-slavery clergyman from Missouri. Pro-slavery people went to Ferril's house and threatened violence. The pro-slavery people left when they saw free-state people coming with guns. On October 1, a woman destroyed the tent of a free-state man. Pro-slavery people came to stop the settlers from building the tent again, but they built the tent again without violence.\nLawrence was first called \"Wakarusa\". It also had different names like \"New Boston\" or \"Yankee Town.\" Some people wanted the city to be called \"Lawrence\" to honor a man named Amos Adams Lawrence. He was a Republican businessman who did not like slavery. People believed that if they named the city \"Lawrence,\" he would give financial support to the city. He did. On October 1, the people voted to name the city Lawrence. On October 17, people started building houses and businesses. Pro-slavery people tried to build houses close to Lawrence, and people from Lawrence hated this. They had a very angry argument. The pro-slavery people threatened violence, but they left. No violence happened.\nIn early October 1854, Andrew Horatio Reeder, the first governor of the Kansas Territory, came to Lawrence. He had a party. He asked everyone to get along. He did not say anything about slavery. The first winter in Lawrence was difficult because it was very cold, and people did not have good houses. Two miles south of Lawrence on November 3, 1854, the first elections were held. At the elections, a man named Henry Davis attacked a pro-slavery man named Lucius Kibbee using a Bowie knife. Kibbee then shot Davis and killed him. This was the first murder in Kansas.\nTwo newspapers were started in 1854. They were the \"Kansas Pioneer\" and the \"Herald of Freedom\". The writers of the newspapers wrote about their belief that slavery was wrong. The Plymouth Congregational Church was built in September 1854; it was the first church in Kansas. In January 1855, Lawrence's first post office was built. The first postmaster was E. D. Ladd. On January 10, 1855, Lawrence's first free school was built. The teacher was Edward Fitch.\n\"Bleeding Kansas\".\nAt the start of 1855, the free-staters and the pro-slavery people around Lawrence started fighting for political power. At the Kansas elections on March 30, 1855, about 700-1,000 pro-slavery people from Missouri voted at the election. They came in more than 100 wagons. They had guns, rifles, pistols, and Bowie knives. They also brought two pieces of artillery. No one argued with them because there were a lot of them. They went back to Missouri the next day. Before the election, the government did a census which showed that 8,601 people lived in Kansas. Of those 2,905 were voters; Lawrence had 369 voters. There were a total of 2,905 voters in the territory, but there were 6,307 votes counted. 1,034 votes were cast in Lawrence, but 802 were from people who did not live in Kansas. Only 232 of the votes were real. At the election, a man named Silas Bond was shot at, and he ran away. He was shot at because he was \"an obnoxious free-state man.\"\nOn August 27, 1855, the pro-slavery people were happy when the Governor Daniel Woodson chose a pro-slavery man, Samuel J. Jones, to be the county sheriff. In October 1855, the anti-slavery man John Brown came to Kansas. He brought many guns to give to other anti-slavery people.\nIn June 1855, the people of Lawrence had a meeting and decided to resist any laws the Kansas legislature passed. They believed the legislature was elected by armed Missouri people, not Kansas people. Amos Lawrence and others sent crates full of rifles. They wrote on the crates that the things inside were books because \"the border ruffians had no use for books,\" so they did not take the rifles when they came to Lawrence. Horace Greeley helped send a howitzer to Lawrence.\nOn November 21, 1855, the pro-slavery man Franklin N. Coleman shot anti-slavery man Charles Dow in the head. This killed him. This happened after many angry arguments between them about land claims. When Sheriff Samuel Jones investigated the crime, Franklin Coleman said he shot Charles Dow in self-defense. Jones believed Coleman because they both were pro-slavery men. Jones decided to arrest Jacob Branson, a friend of Charles Dow and an anti-slavery man, for disturbing the peace. A group of anti-slavery people saved Branson.\nSacking of Lawrence.\nWilson Shannon, the governor of the Kansas Territory, saw that the people were becoming very angry and violent. He asked the Kansas militia to come and keep the peace. Shannon wanted the people in the militia to be from Kansas, but Samuel Jones brought 1,200-1,500 men from Missouri. When the people of Lawrence learned this, they made a militia of 600-800 men. They chose Robinson to lead the militia. James H. Lane was chosen as his second-in-command. John Brown and his four sons also joined to fight. Both groups were ready to fight, but they could not because the winter was very cold. Wilson Shannon decided to prevent a fight. He demanded that the leaders of both sides agree to a peace treaty. They did, and the men from Missouri went back to Missouri. This \"war\" is known as the Wakarusa War.\nIn spring 1856, pro-slavery people wanted to make the free-staters weak. The pro-slavery people said that the \"Herald of Freedom\" newspaper, the \"Kansas Free State\" newspaper, and the Eldridge Hotel were very bad. On April 23, 1856, Samuel Jones came to Lawrence. He tried to arrest some anti-slavery people who had created their own anti-slavery government. A sniper shot Samuel Jones, but he did not die. The people of Lawrence made Jones leave. On May 11, Federal Marshall (like a police officer but for the entire country) Israel B. Donaldson said that people interfered with Samuel Jones which was not legal. A Kansas grand jury agreed. They said that Lawrence built the Free State Hotel (the Eldridge Hotel) for military purposes. Donaldson, Jones, and others recruited an army of 800 men to enforce the law. However, they also wanted to stop the anti-slavery men in Lawrence.\nOn May 21, Donaldson and Jones took their army to Lawrence. They arrested more anti-slavery people. The people of Lawrence hoped that Donaldson and Jones would leave after the arrests, but this did not happen. Jones and his men started sacking Lawrence. They took over Charles Robinson's house and used it as a headquarters. They attacked free-state newspapers offices. They struck the printing presses, and they threw the sort into the Kansas River. They shot the Free State Hotel (the Eldridge Hotel) using a cannon and burned it down. They took $30,000 worth of things. After burning Charles Robinson's house, the army left. The day of destruction was called the \"Sacking of Lawrence.\" Surprisingly, only one person died; a man died when he was hit by falling masonry. In late September 1856, another sack seemed like it was about to happen when 2,700 pro-slavery men came to Lawrence. Anti-slavery men defended the city. Governor John W. Geary saw what was happening. He asked for federal reinforcements to defend the city. No violence happened.\nAnti-slavery capital.\nIn 1855 and 1857, Lawrence got a charter (a document that officially creates a town) from the pro-slavery Kansas government. The people of Lawrence resisted the Kansas government because they believed they were too pro-slavery. They did not accept it because it would force Lawrence to follow pro-slavery laws. In July 1857, the people of Lawrence tried to get an \"official\" (only the people of Lawrence saw it as official) charter from the extralegal (having no real authority) anti-slavery government. If they could not get one, Lawrence would simply make one themselves. Governor Robert J. Walker believed this was a revolt. On July 15, 1857, he sent an army to Lawrence and declared martial law. The army stayed close to Lawrence until October 1857. They stayed until October because there were elections. They wanted to make sure that there would be no violence at the elections. Anti-slavery people won the elections. The Kansas government became controlled by anti-slavery people. In early 1858, Samuel Jones quit his job, and he left Kansas. On January 16, 1858, Lawrence became the county seat of Douglas County. In February 1858, the Kansas government approved an anti-slavery charter for Lawrence. James Blood became the first mayor of Lawrence. The anti-slavery Kansas government met in Lawrence many times. In practice, Lawrence became the capital of Kansas from 1858 until 1861.\nAmerican Civil War and Kansas becoming a state.\nOn October 4, 1859, the people of Kansas voted to approve the Wyandotte Constitution. There were 10,421 \"yes\" votes and 5,530 \"no\" votes. The United States Congress approved the Wyandotte Constitution. Kansas became a free state on January 29, 1861. Pro-slavery people in Kansas knew they had lost. Kansas becoming a free state ended Bleeding Kansas. However, the American Civil War began around the same time.\nDuring the war, many Jayhawkers stayed in Lawrence. These Jayhawkers went to Missouri. They stole items and burned farms there. Many people in the Confederacy believed that the stolen items were in Lawrence. On August 21, 1863, a pro-slavery man named William Quantrill rode into Lawrence with some men. They destroyed much of the town. They killed every adult man they saw. More than 150 men and boys died. There was 2,000,000 dollars worth of property destroyed. The Plymouth Congregational Church was not destroyed, but many of its people died. This attack is known as the Lawrence massacre.\nAfter Quantrill's Raid, the people and Union soldiers rebuilt the city. It was not easy because the winter was very cold. They continued rebuilding until they finished in 1864. While they were rebuilding, the people of Lawrence were afraid of another attack. The military built some camps in Lawrence to guard the city, but no more attacks happened. After the Civil War, the camps were closed and removed.\nAfter the Civil War.\nThere was a plan to build a university in Kansas in 1855, but it did not happen until Kansas became a state in 1861. The Kansas government needed to decide where to build the university. Their choices were Manhattan, Emporia, or Lawrence. On January 13, 1863, Kansas State University was built in Manhattan. However, the Kansas government decided to build another one. The only cities left where a university could be built were Emporia and Lawrence. Amos A. Lawrence gave $10,000 and more than 40 acres (160,000\u00a0m2) of land for a university in Lawrence. The Kansas government liked that, so the government chose Lawrence. The University of Kansas opened in 1866.\nIn 1864, Lawrence got its first railroad. It connected Lawrence to Kansas City. The first train to go to Lawrence went on November 28, 1864. The first train to cross the Kansas River crossed it in Lawrence on November 1, 1867.\nIn the early 1870s, Lawrence needed more electricity. The city asked Orlando Darling to build a dam on the Kansas River. Darling became angry because it took a long time to build a dam, so he stopped. The Lawrence Land &amp; Water Company finished building the dam in 1873. The dam made Lawrence special because few cities had a dam. The dam closed in 1968, but the city reopened it in 1977. They wanted to build a new city hall next to the dam. Today, the dam helps prevent flooding.\nIn 1863, the first windmill in Kansas was built in Lawrence. It burned during Quantrill's Raid. In 1864, people rebuilt it. It cost them $9,700. People used it until July 1895. On April 30, 1905, the windmill burned, and it was not rebuilt.\nIn 1884, a school for Native Americans was built in Lawrence. It was named the United States Industrial Training School. Boys learned farming, blacksmithing, and more. Girls learned cooking and homemaking. In 1887, the name changed to the Haskell Institute. It was named after Dudley Haskell, a state legislator who helped make sure the school was built in Lawrence. In 1993, it was renamed the Haskell Indian Nations University.\n20th century.\nIn 1888, Jabez B. Watkins opened the Watkins National Bank at 11th Street and Massachusetts Street. It closed in 1929. The building was given to the city to become the city hall. In 1970, Lawrence built a new city hall, so the building became a museum. It was called the Watkins Community Museum, and it opened in 1975.\nIn 1903, the Kansas River flooded, which did a lot of damage. The water was high. The damage in North Lawrence was very bad. Lawrence was hit by other floods in 1951, when the water was 30 feet high. It was hit again in 1993. However, the damage was not very bad because of the reservoir and a levee.\nIn 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt came to Lawrence. He gave a short speech, and he dedicated a fountain at 9th &amp; New Hampshire Street. In 1910, Roosevelt came to Lawrence again after visiting Osawatomie.\nIn 1871, the Lawrence Street Railway Company was created. It made it easy for people to go to hotels and businesses on Massachusetts Street. They had the first streetcar in Lawrence. Horses and mules were used to pull the streetcar. They could be used only on Massachusetts Street. After the 1903 flood, the Kansas River Bridge had to be rebuilt. It was not safe for streetcars to go on the bridge. The Lawrence Street Railway Company closed in 1903. In 1902, C. L. Rutter tried to start a bus system. He failed. In 1907, he tried again. In 1909, a new streetcar system was built which caused Rutter's buses to close. The streetcar system stayed until 1935. In 1909, the streetcar company made a roller coaster. It was called \"Casey's Coaster.\" Some people called it \"Daisy's Dozer.\" It was made out of wood. It stayed until the 1920s.\nIn 1921, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital opened with 50 beds. By 1980, it had 200 beds. It has won many awards for good quality care and service.\nIn 1929, Lawrence had its 75th birthday. To celebrate, a big rock was placed. It is called \"Founder's Rock\" to remember the early settlers who came to Lawrence from the New England Emigrant Aid Company. On October 14, 1929, they opened the Lawrence Municipal Airport to the public.\nIn 1943, during World War II, the United States government brought prisoners of war to Lawrence. They were mostly German and Italian people. The government brought them because farmers needed more workers. They were forced to live in camps which were like prisons. Lawrence's camp was near 11th Street and Haskell Avenue. The camp closed in 1945.\nIn 1983, a famous movie, \"The Day After\", was filmed in Lawrence. The movie is about a fictional nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nIn 1989, the Lawrence Free State Brewing Company opened on Massachusetts Street. It was the first brewery in Kansas in over 100 years. The brewery is also a restaurant.\nIn 2007, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" said Lawrence was one of the best places to retire. In 2011, \"Parents &amp; Colleges\" said Lawrence was one of the 10 best college towns in the United States.\nGeography.\nLawrence is in northeastern Kansas. It is about east of Topeka and west of Kansas City, Kansas. The tallest place in Lawrence is Mount Oread at the University of Kansas, which is tall.\nLawrence is on the southern part of the Dissected Till Plains. To the south are the Osage Plains. The United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of . Of that, is land and is water.\nLawrence is between the Kansas River and the Wakarusa River. Many creeks flow through Lawrence. The Wakarusa River was dammed to create Clinton Lake. The University of Kansas has a small lake called Potter's Lake. The Haskell-Baker Wetlands is a big area with wetlands, plants, trails, and more. They are supported by Haskell University and Baker University. The wetlands are southeast of Lawrence.\nLawrence has 54 parks, cemeteries, and community parks. The community parks are South Park, Buford Watson Park, Broken Arrow Park, Riverfront Park, Holcomb Park, \"Dad\" Perry Park, Centennial Park and Prairie Park. Cemeteries include Oak Hill, Maple Grove and Memorial Park. Pioneer Cemetery is a cemetery that has some of the earliest people from Lawrence. It was created in 1854. It is at the University of Kansas.\nClimate.\nLawrence has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa\"), so it has hot and humid summers, with cold and dry winters. The highest temperature recorded was on August 11, 1934. The lowest temperature recorded was on February 12, 1899.\nEvery year, it gets of precipitation on average. Most of it happens during the summer.\nCity design.\nStreets.\nThe main street in Lawrence is called Massachusetts Street. Many early residents of Lawrence came because of the New England Emigrant Aid Company which was from Massachusetts. Streets that went north and south were named after US states in the order they became part of the country. Streets that go east and west were name after famous Revolutionary War heroes. Over time, people broke the first rule. Some states were never used, and some states were put in the wrong order. In 1913, the east and west streets became numbered streets.\nNeighborhoods.\nLawrence is organized into neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are close to downtown Lawrence like Old West Lawrence, North Lawrence, East Lawrence, Oread, Hancock and Pinckney.

The town overlooks Hilo Bay.\nHilo is near two shield volcanoes\nSome of the best ground-based astronomical observatories are on Mauna Kea.\nHilo is home to the University of Hawaii at Hilo, as well as the Merrie Monarch Festival, a week-long celebration of ancient and modern hula, which takes place every year after Easter. It is also home to the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation, one of the world's leading producers of macadamia nuts. It is served by Hilo International Airport, inside the CDP.\nHistory.\nAlthough there is not much archaeological evidence, people lived in the areas along Hilo Bay, Wailuku and Wailoa Rivers before the Western world made contact. They were known as the Hilo. They dominated the high mountaintops until the middle 1800s. Hilo means high mountaintop in the original language of the native peoples who lived on the mountaintops. King Kamehameha, the first king of Hawaii, conquered all the islands and then moved the Hilo mountain settlement to the shore after the arrival of outsiders.\nOriginally, the name Hilo applied to the whole district of Hilo, now divided into South Hilo District and North Hilo District. When William Ellis visited in 1823, the main settlement in Hilo district was Wai\u0101kea on Hilo Bay. Missionaries came to the district in the early to middle 1800s, founding several churches, notably Haili Church, in the area of modern Hilo.\nHilo expanded as sugar plantations in the surrounding area created new jobs and drew in many workers from Asia, making the city a trading center.\nA breakwater across Hilo Bay was begun in the 1900s and completed in 1929. On April 1, 1946, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake near the Aleutian Islands created a fourteen-meter high tsunami that hit Hilo 4.9 hours later, killing 160 people. In response an early warning system, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, was established in 1949 to track these killer waves and provide warning. This tsunami also meant the end of the Hawaii Consolidated Railway, and instead the Hawaii Belt Road was built north of Hilo using some of the railbed.\nOn May 23, 1960, another tsunami, caused by a 9.5 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Chile the previous day, claimed 61 lives allegedly due to people's failure to heed warning sirens. Low-lying bayfront areas of the city on Wai\u0101kea peninsula and along Hilo Bay, previously populated, were rededicated as parks and memorials.\nGeography and climate.\nHilo is at (19.705520, -155.085918).\nHilo is classified by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), and has a total area of , of which is land and of which (7.10%) is water.\nHilo features a tropical rainforest climate (Koppen \"Af\"), with substantial rainfall throughout the course of the year. Hilo's location on the eastern side of the island of Hawaii (windward relative to the trade winds) makes it the wettest city in the United States and one of the wettest cities in the world.

The hospital opened in September 1779.\nFrom September 1784 the festival was held every three years. It continued to raise money for the hospital.\nThe church and theatre where the festival was held became too small, so in 1834 they built Birmingham Town Hall which had much more room.\nMany famous musicians performed at the festival. In 1837 Felix Mendelssohn conducted a performance of his oratorio \"St. Paul\", played the organ, and played the piano part in the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 2 which had been especially commissioned by the Festival. In the next festival he played his Piano Concerto No. 1. In 1846 (a year before he died) the festival commissioned him to write his oratorio \"Elijah\". It was a huge success. He was paid 200 guineas. \"Elijah\" was played at every festival after that.\nThe festival commissioned other composers to write works, these included: Arthur Sullivan, Max Bruch, Charles Gounod and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.\nThe great conductor Hans Richter was made principal conductor in 1885.\nEdward Elgar wrote several works for the festival. In 1900 his oratorio \"The Dream of Gerontius\" was given its first performance. In 1903 he performed \"The Apostles\", and 1906 \"The Kingdom\". In 1912 he wrote \"The Music Makers\". The principal conductor for 1912 was Henry Wood.\nThe 1909 and 1912 festivals lost a lot of money and they could not give any money to the hospital. This was soon followed by World War I, so the festival stopped and did not continue after the war."}

The song is in three-part harmony, sung by Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Harrison. At the end of the song, the music stops abruptly and a Ringo Starr drum fill leads into the next track, \"Mean Mr. Mustard\".\nThe mixing of Romance languages occurs in the last three lines of the song. In 1969, Lennon was interviewed about these lyrics and said, \"We just started joking, you know, singing 'cuando para mucho.' So we just made up... Paul knew a few Spanish words from school, you know. So we just strung any Spanish words that sounded vaguely like something. And of course we got 'chicka ferdy' in. That's a Liverpool expression. Just like sort of-- it doesn't mean anything to me but (childish taunting) 'na-na, na-na-na!'\"\nIn 1976, The Bee Gees covered the song for the musical documentary \"All This and World War II\"."}

Diane Ashley, one of the group, says: \"We were bored, he was out and so we decided to pay him a visit. We found a ladder in his garden and stuck it up at the bathroom window which he'd left slightly open. I was the one who climbed up and got in.\" She then opened the front door to let the others in, and they stole a number of photographs. Another Apple scruff, Margo Bird, remembers being good friends with McCartney - she would often take his dog for walks - and later got a job at Apple Corps. She says that she was asked to get back a certain photograph, which she did.\nIn the 2006 DVD documentary \"The Classic Artists Series: The Moody Blues\" (DVD UK, released October 2006), Mike Pinder, the former keyboard player of Birmingham R&amp;B band The Moody Blues, states that the inspiration for the song actually rests with an incident that happened to them\u2014a groupie climbing into an open bathroom window in the band's home and spending the night with band member Ray Thomas. The next day, Pinder and Thomas told the story to McCartney, who\u2014guitar in hand\u2014strummed and sang \"She came in through the bathroom window...\".\nRecording.\nThe Beatles recorded the rhythm track for this and Polythene Pam as one piece on 25 July 1969. It took them 39 attempts, after which they added lead vocals and re-recorded the drums and bass guitar parts.\nOn July 28, they added more vocals, guitar, percussion and piano. The song was completed two days later with additional guitar and percussion.\nThis song was performed directly after \"Polythene Pam\", the song on the preceding track, without pause.\nAt the very beginning of the song, in anticipation to the change of meter, John Lennon says \"we'll listen to that now... heh-heh\" and then shouts \"Oh, look out!\" A slower, ethereal version of this song, recorded during the \"Let It Be\" sessions, appears on \"Anthology 3\"."}

It was the last song recorded by all four of the Beatles, and is the final song of the medley that dominates side two of the LP version of the album. \nComposition and recording.\nMcCartney said, \"I wanted [the medley] to end with a little meaningful couplet, so I followed the Bard [ Shakespeare ] and wrote a couplet.\" In his 1980 interview with \"Playboy\", John Lennon said, \"That's Paul again ... He had a line in it, 'And in the end, the love you get is equal to the love you give,' which is a very cosmic, philosophical line. Which again proves that if he wants to, he can think.\" Lennon misquoted the line slightly; the actual words are, \"And, in the end, the love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\"\nRecording began on July 23, 1969, when the Beatles recorded a one-minute, 20-second master recording that was extended via overdubs to two minutes and five seconds. At this point, the song was called \"Ending.\" The first vocals for the song were added on August 5, more vocals and guitar overdubs were added on August 7, and bass and drums on August 8, the day the \"Abbey Road\" cover picture was taken. Orchestral overdubs were added August 15, and the closing piano and accompanying vocal on August 18.\nAll four Beatles have a solo in \"The End\", including a Ringo Starr drum solo. Starr did not like solos. McCartney, Harrison, and Lennon perform a rotating sequence of three, two-bar guitar solos. The solos begin 53 seconds into the song and end just before the final piano part. Lennon described it in his 1970 interview with \"Rolling Stone\": \"There's a nice little bit I played on \"Abbey Road\". Paul gave us each a piece, a little break where Paul plays, George plays and I play.\" The first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, and the third two by Lennon, then the sequence repeats. Each has a style which McCartney felt reflected their personalities: McCartney's playing included string bends similar to his lead guitar work on \"Another Girl\" from the \"Help!\" album; Harrison's was melodic with slides yet technically advanced and Lennon's was rhythmic, stinging and had the heaviest distortion. Immediately after Lennon's third solo, the piano chords of the final line \"And in the end...\" begin. Then the orchestration arrangement takes over with a humming chorus and Harrison playing a final guitar solo that ends the song. \nPaul and John's last guitar solos and the drum solo were used in the intro to \"Get Back\" in the Beatles' Love.\n\"The End\" was at first intended to be the final track on \"Abbey Road\", but it is followed by \"Her Majesty\". In the first practice mix, \"Her Majesty\" followed \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" (on the released version of the album, \"Her Majesty\" begins with the excised final chord of \"Mean Mr. Mustard\"). According to sound engineer John Kurlander, McCartney said, \"I don't like 'Her Majesty,' throw it away.\" Kurlander cut it out, but said, \"I'd been told never to throw anything away, so after he left I picked it up off the floor, put about 20 seconds of red leader tape before it, and stuck it onto the end of the edit tape.\" When McCartney heard \"Her Majesty\" in its new position he liked it and decided that it should remain on the album.\nReception.\nRichie Unterberger of Allmusic said that \"The End\" was to be \"the group's take on the improvised jamming common to heavy rock of the late '60s, though as usual the Beatles did it with far more economic precision than anyone else.\" John Mendelsohn of \"Rolling Stone\" said it was \"a perfect epitaph for our visit to the world of Beatle daydreams: \"The love you take is equal to the love you make.\"."}
{"id": "257117", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257117", "title": "History of ancient Israel and Judah", "text": "Israel and Judah were Iron Age kingdoms of the old Near East. The area of time covered in this page is from the first mention of the name Israel in the archaeological record (1200 BCE) to the end of a independent Judean kingdom near the time of Jesus Christ.\nThe two kingdoms arose on the most eastern coast of the Mediterranean, the most western part of the Fertile Crescent, between the old empires of Egypt to the south, Assyria, Babylonia, later Persia to the north and east, Greece and later Rome across the sea to the west. The area is small, maybe only 100\u00a0miles north to south and 40 or 50\u00a0miles east to west.\nIsrael and Judah were from the Canaanite culture of the late Bronze Age, and were based on villages that formed and grew in the southern Levant highlands (today for the region between the coastal plain and the Jordan Valley) between c. 1200-1000 BCE. Israel became an important local power in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE before falling to the Assyrians. The southern kingdom, Judah, became rich inside the greater empires of the region before a revolt against Babylon led to it being destroyed early in the 6th century.\nJudean exiles returned from Babylon early in the following Persian period, starting a Judahite presence in the province of Yehud, as Judah was now called. Yehud was absorbed into the subsequent Greek-ruled kingdoms which followed the conquests of Alexander the Great. In the 2nd century BC, the Jews went up against Greek rule and created the Hasmonean kingdom, which became first a Roman dependency and soon went under the rule of the Roman Empire.\nLate Bronze Age background (1550-1200 BCE).\nGeography and human settlement.\nThe eastern Mediterranean seaboard - the Levant - goes 400\u00a0miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai desert, and 70 to 100\u00a0miles east to west between the sea and the Arabian desert. The coastal area of the southern Levant, large in the south and becoming short to the north, the southernmost part has a zone of foothills, the Shephalah; like the plain this area narrows as it goes northwards, ending at Mount Carmel. East of the plain and the Shephalah is a mountainous ridge, the \"hill country of Judah\" in the south, the \"hill country of Ephraim\" north of that, then Galilee and the Lebanon mountains. To the east again lie the steep-sided valley occupied by the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, and the wadi of the Arabah, which continues down to the eastern arm of the Red Sea. Beyond the plateau is the Syrian Desert, separating the Levant from Mesopotamia. To the southwest is Egypt, to the northeast Mesopotamia. \"The Levant thus constitutes a narrow corridor whose geographical setting made it a constant area of contention between more powerful entities\".\nThe central and northern part of the Levantine coast was known in Classical times as Phoenicia; the southernmost portion was known to the Egyptians as Canaan, by which they seem to have meant all their Asian possessions. In the bible Canaan can mean all of the land west of the Jordan river, or, more narrowly, the coastal strip. By Classical times the name Canaan had been dropped in favour of \"Philistia\", \"Land of the Philistines\", despite the fact that the Philistines had long since disappeared. The modern name \"Palestine\" is derived from this. Northeast of Canaan/Palestine was Aram, later called Syria after the Assyrians, who had likewise long since vanished.\nSettlement during the Late Bronze Age was concentrated in the coastal plain and along major communication routes, with the central hill-country only sparsely inhabited; each city had its own ruler, constantly at odds with his neighbours and appealing to the Egyptians to adjudicate his differences. One of these Canaanite states was Jerusalem: letters from the Egyptian archives indicate that it followed the usual Late Bronze pattern of a small city with surrounding farmlands and villages; unlike most other Late Bronze city-states, there is no indication that it was destroyed at the end of the period.\nCanaan and the Late Bronze collapse.\nCanaan in the 13th and early 12th centuries had people of various origins, united by a common socioeconomic system of city-states administered and controlled by Egypt. Egyptian power and the Canaanite city-state system collapsed. From the collapse two new communities emerged in the 12th century BCE, the Israelites in the hill country and the Philistines in the southern part of the coastal plain. The Philistines clearly represent the arrival of a considerable number of outsiders, probably from Cyprus, with their own non-indigenous culture. The Israelites are just as clearly indigenous to Canaan: to take linguistics as just one indicator, Judahite and Israelite Hebrew of the early 1st millennium BCE group with Phoenician, Ammonite, Moabite and Edomite; and within that grouping a \"core Canaanite\" of Israelite and Phoenician can be distinguished from a \"fringe Canaanite\" of Judahite, Ammonite, Moabite and Edomite.\nThe causes of the Bronze Age collapse - which extended throughout the eastern Mediterranean - are obscure. Drought, famine and other stresses may be behind the widespread population movements of the time. Whatever the cause, several important Canaanite cities were destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age (over a period of more than a century), and Canaanite culture was gradually absorbed into that of the Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelites.\nPre-Exilic period.\nIron Age I (1200-1000 BCE).\nThe Merneptah stele, erected by an Egyptian pharaoh about 1200\u00a0BC, contains the first record of the name Israel: \"Israel is laid waste and his seed is not.\" This Israel, identified as a people, were probably in the northern part of the central highlands. As chaos spread, people went to live in the previously unsettled highlands: surveys have identified more than 300 small settlements, most of them new and the largest with a population of no more than 300, in the Palestinian highlands during Iron Age I. The villages were bigger and more numerous in the northern regions (biblical Manasseh and Ephraim), although no settlements can be described as urban. The total settled population at the beginning of the period was about 20,000, and double this number by the end. Nevertheless, while Iron Age I villages with features such as four-roomed houses, collar-rim store jars, and hewn water-cisterns are counted as Israelite when found in the highlands, it is in fact impossible to differentiate these from Canaanite sites of the same period; nor is it possible to distinguish between Hebrew and Canaanite inscriptions down to the 10th century.\nIn Iron Age I the highlands lack any sign of centralised authority, or of temples, shrines, or centralised worship in general (although cult-objects associated with the Canaanite god El have been found); almost the sole marker distinguishing the highland \"Israelite\" villages from Cannanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether this can be taken as an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.\nThe same period saw the rise of the kingdoms of the kingdoms of Aram Damascus and Ammon to the east of the northern hill country, Moab (east of the Dead Sea), and Edom (in the Arabah south of the Dead Sea), in that order.\nIron Age II (1000-586 BCE).\nAn inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I, probably identical with the biblical Shishak, record a series of campaigns apparently directed at the area immediately north of Jerusalem in the second half of the 10th century BCE. About a hundred years later, in the 9th century BCE, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III names Ahab of Israel among his enemies at the battle of Qarqar (853 BCE), while in the Mesha stele (c.830 BCE) a king of Moab celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the \"House of Omri\" (i.e. Israel). Similarly, the Tel Dan stele tells of the death of a king of Israel, probably Jehoram, at the hands of an Aramaen king about 841 BCE. Excavations at Samaria, the Israelite capital, further reinforce the impression of a powerful, centralised kingdom in the northern highlands during the 9th and 8th centuries. In the second half of the 8th century king Hoshea of Israel revolted against the Assyrians, and was crushed (c.722 BCE). Part of the population was deported, outside settlers were brought in to replace them, and Israel became an Assyrian province.\nThe first evidence for the existence of an organised kingdom in the southern region comes from the mid 9th century Tel Dan stele, which mentions the death of a king of the \"House of David\" alongside the king of Israel; the contemporary Mesha stele may also mention the House of David, although the reconstruction which allows this reading is disputed. It is generally assumed that this \"House of David\" is identical with the biblical dynasty, but the archaeological evidence from surface surveys indicates that during the 10th and 9th centuries Jerusalem was only one of the four large villages in the area, with no sign of primacy over its neighbours. It was only in the last part of the 8th century that Jerusalem experienced a period of rapid growth, achieving a population far greater than at any time before and clear primacy over the surrounding towns. The older scholarly reconstruction of events is that this was due to an influx of refugees from Israel following its conquest by the Assyrians (c.722\u00a0BC), but the newer view is that it reflects a cooperative effort between Assyria and the kings of Jerusalem to establish Judah as a pro-Assyrian vassal state exercising control over the valuable olive industry. The sudden collapse of the Assyrian power in the last half of the 7th century led to an unsuccessful bid for independence under king Josiah, followed by the destruction of Jerusalem by Assyria's successor, the neo-Babylonian empire (587/586 BCE).\nExilic and Post-Exilic period.\nBabylonian and Persian periods (586-333 BCE).\nIn 586 BCE, the Babylonians, under king Nebuchadnezzar II captured Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple of Solomon, ended the Davidic kingship, and carried the people into captivity. Only the poorest were left behind in Judah, now the Babylonian province of Yehud with its capital at Mizpah in the former territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. A few years later, again according to the bible, the governor of Yehud was murdered by rivals, triggering another exodus of refugees, this time to Egypt. Thus by about 580 the people of Judah were to be found in three separate locations, the elite in Babylon (where, incidentally, they appear to have been well treated), a large community in Egypt, and a remnant in Judah. The Exile ended when Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylon (traditionally 538 BCE). The Persians reconstituted Judah/Yehud as a province (\"Yehud medinata\") within the satrapy \"Beyond the River\", and over the following century some of the exiles returned to Jerusalem. There they eventually rebuilt the Temple (traditionally 516/515 BCE), but for over a century the administrative capital remained at Mizpah. Samaria, meanwhile, continued as the province of Semarina within the same satrapy as Yehud.\nThe Persian Period.\nIn 539 BCE the Persians conquered Babylon and in 537 BCE, inaugurated the Persian period of Jewish history. In 520 BCE Cyrus the Great allowed Jews to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple (completed 515 BCE). He appointed Zerubbabel (the grandson of the second to last Judean king, Jehoiachin) governor, but did not allow the restoration of the kingdom. The influence of Zoroastrianism on monotheism, Judaism, as well as Christianity are still the subject of academic debate.\nWithout a powerful king, the Temple became more powerful, and priests became the dominant authority. However, the Second Temple had been constructed under a foreign power, and there were lingering questions about its legitimacy. This provided the condition for various sects to develop within Judaism over the coming centuries, each of which claimed to represent \"Judaism\". Most of these typically discouraged social intercourse, especially marriage, with members of other sects.\nThe end of the Babylonian Exile saw not only the construction of the Second Temple, but, according to the Documentary Hypothesis, the final version ion of the Torah as well. Although the priests controlled the monarchy and the Temple, scribes and sages (who later became the \"rabbis\") monopolized the study of the Torah, which (starting from the time of Ezra) was read publicly on market-days. These sages developed and maintained an oral tradition alongside of the Holy Writ, and identified with the prophets. According to Geza Vermes, such scribes were often addressed using a basic term of respect, \"lord.\"\nHellenistic and Roman periods (333 BCE-70 CE).\nThe Hellenistic period began in 332 BCE when Alexander the Great conquered Persia. Upon his death in 323 BCE, his empire was divided among his generals. At first, Judea was ruled by the Egyptian-Hellenic Ptolemies, but in 198 BCE, the Syrian-Hellenic Seleucid Empire, under Antiochus III, seized control over Judea.\nThe Hellenistic Period saw the canonization of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), according to one theory, and the emergence of extra-Biblical sacred traditions. The earliest evidence of a Jewish mysticism tradition surrounds the book of Ezekiel, written during the Babylonian Exile. Virtually all known mystical texts, however, were written at the end of the Second Temple period. Some scholars think the esoteric traditions of the Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), were influenced by Persian beliefs, Platonic philosophy and Gnosticism.\n2 Esdras 14:45-46, which was written in the second century CE, declares: \"Make public the twenty-four books that you wrote first, and let the worthy and the unworthy read them; but keep the seventy that were written last, in order to give them to the wise among your people.\" This is the first known reference to the canonized Hebrew Bible, and the seventy non-canonical texts may have been mystical; the Talmud suggests other mystical traditions which may have their roots in Second Temple Judaism.\nThe Near East was cosmopolitan, especially during the Hellenistic period. Several languages were used, and the matter of the \"lingua franca\" is still subject of some debate. The Jews almost certainly spoke Aramaic among themselves. Greek was often used throughout the entire eastern portion of the Mediterranean. Judaism was rapidly changing, reacting and adapting to a larger political, cultural, and intellectual world, and in turn drawing the interests of non-Jews.\nHistorian Shaye Cohen observed:\nCultural Struggles with Hellenism.\nMany Jews lived in the Diaspora, and the Judean provinces of Judea, Samaria, and the Galilee were populated by many Gentiles (who often showed an interest in Judaism). Jews had to live with the values of Hellenism and Hellenistic philosophy, which were often directly at odds with their own values and traditions. Broadly, Hellenistic culture saw itself as a civilizor, bringing civilized values and ways to peoples they thought of as insular or either backwards or degenerate.\nFor example, Greek-style bath houses were built in sight of the Temple in Jerusalem, for instance, and even in that city the \"gymnasium\" became a center of social, athletic, and intellectual life. Many Jews, including some of the more aristocratic priests, embraced these institutions, although Jews who did so were often looked down upon due to their circumcision, which Jews saw as the mark of their covenant with God, but which Hellenistic culture viewed as an aesthetic defacement of the body. Consequently, some Jews began to abandon the practice of circumcision (and thus their covenant with God), while others bridled at Greek domination.\nAt the same time that Jews were confronting the cultural differences at their door, they had to confront a paradox in their own tradition: their Torah laws applied only to them, and to proselytes, but their God, they believed, was the one and only God of all. This situation led to new interpretations of the Torah, some of which were influenced by Hellenic thought and in response to Gentile interest in Judaism. It was in this period that many concepts from early Greek philosophy entered or influenced Judaism, as well as debates and sects within the religion and culture of the time.\nIn 331 BCE Alexander the Great took over the Persian Empire. Upon his death in 323 BCE his empire crumbled, and the province of Yehud became part of the kingdom of Egypt, ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty. Ptolemaic rule was mild: Alexandria became the largest Jewish city in the world, and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt (281-246 BCE) promoted Jewish culture, sponsoring the Septuagint translation of the Torah. This period also saw the beginning of the Pharisees and other Jewish Second Temple parties such as the Sadducees and Essenes. But in the early 2nd century BCE Yehud fell to the Seleucid Syrian ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes (174-163 BCE), who, in contrast to the tolerance shown by the Ptolemids, attempted complete Hellenization of the Jews. His desecration of the Temple sparked a national rebellion, which ended in the expulsion of the Syrians and the re-consecration of the Temple under the Maccabees\nThe kingdom established by the Maccabees was a conscious attempt to revive the Judah described in the bible: a Jewish monarchy ruled from Jerusalem and stretching over all the territories once ruled by David and Solomon. In order to carry out this project the Hasmonean kings conquered (and forcibly converted to Judaism) the one-time Moabites, Edomites and Ammonites, as well as the lost kingdom of Israel.\nGenerally, the Jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute, and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally. Nevertheless, Jews were divided between those favoring hellenization and those opposing it, and were divided over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids. When the High Priest Simon II died in 175 BCE, conflict broke out between supporters of his son Onias III (who opposed hellenization, and favored the Ptolemies) and his son Jason (who favored hellenization, and favored the Seleucids). A period of political intrigue followed, with priests such as Menelaus bribing the king to win the High Priesthood, and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title. The result was a brief civil war.\nHuge numbers of Jews flocked to Jason's side, and in 167 BCE the Seleucid king Antiochus IV invaded Judea, entered the Temple, and stripped it of money and ceremonial objects. Jason fled to Egypt, and Antiochus imposed a program of forced hellenization, requiring Jews to abandon their own laws and customs under threat of slaughter. At this point Mattathias and his five sons, John, Eleazar, Simon, Jonathan, and Judah Maccabee, priests of the Hasmon family living in the rural village of Modein (pronounced \"Mo-Ah-Dein\"), assumed leadership of a bloody and ultimately successful revolt against the Seleucids.\nJudah liberated Jerusalem in 165 BCE and restored the Temple. Fighting continued, and Judah and his brother Jonathan were killed. In 141 BCE an assembly of priests and others affirmed Simon as high priest and leader, in effect establishing the Hasmonean dynasty. When Simon was killed in 135 BCE, his son (and Judah's nephew) John Hyrcanus took his place as high priest and king.\nThe Hasmonean kingdom.\nAfter defeating the Seleucid forces, John Hyrcanus established a new monarchy in the form of the priestly Hasmonean dynasty in 152 BCE \u2014 thus making priests as political as well as religious authorities. Although the Hasmoneans were popularly seen as heroes and leaders for resisting the Seleucids, some regarded their reign as lacking the religious legitimacy conferred by descent from the Davidic dynasty of the First Temple Era.\nSadducees, Essenes, and Pharisees.\nThe rift between the priests and the sages grew during the Hellenistic period, when the Jews faced new political and cultural struggles. Around this time the Sadducee party emerged as the party of the priests and allied elites (the name \"Sadducee\" comes from Zadok, the high priest of the first Temple).\nThe Essenes were another early mystical-religious movement, who are believed to have rejected either the Seleucid appointed high priests, or the Hasmonean high priests, as wrong. But they soon rejected the Second Temple, arguing that the Essene community was itself the new Temple, and that obedience to the law represented a new form of sacrifice.\nAlthough their lack of concern for the Second Temple alienated the Essenes from the great mass of Jews, their notion that the sacred could exist outside of the Temple was shared by another group, the Pharisees (\"separatists\"), based within the community of scribes and sages. The meaning of the name is unclear, though.\nDuring the Hasmonean period, the Sadducees and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties (the Essenes not being as politically oriented). The political differences between the Sadducees and Pharisees became evident when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannai choose between being king and being High Priest in the traditional manner. This demand led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties. Alexander was succeeded by his widow, whose brother was a leading Pharisee. Upon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus II, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees.\nIn 64 BCE the Roman general Pompey took over Jerusalem and made the Jewish kingdom a client of Rome. In 57-55 BCE Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split it into Galilee, Samaria &amp; Judea, with 5 district Sanhedrin/Synedrion (councils of law). In 40-39 BCE Herod the Great was appointed King of the Jews by the Roman Senate, but in 6 CE his successor, Herod Archelaus, ethnarch of Judea, was deposed by the emperor Augustus and his territories annexed as Iudaea Province under direct Roman administration: this marked the end of Judah as an even theoretically independent kingdom.\nReligion.\nIsrael and Judah inherited the religion of late first-millennium Canaan, and Canaanite religion in turn had its roots in the religion of second-millennium Ugarit. In the 2nd millennium, polytheism was expressed through the concepts of the divine council and the divine family."}

The song begins the progression that leads to the end of the album and is followed by \"Carry That Weight.\" The two songs were recorded together as a single piece, and both were written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney).\nRecording.\nMcCartney was the lead vocalist. He begins the song in a soft tone, with piano, bass guitar, and string section accompaniment. Starting with the line \"Golden slumbers fill your eyes\", the drums come in and McCartney switches to a stronger tone.

The ending also repeats the arpeggiated guitar motif from the end of that song, similar to the figure featured in the George Harrison written songs \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Badge\" (co-written by Harrison and Eric Clapton).\nMeaning.\nMusic critic Ian MacDonald said that the lyrics were an acknowledgment by the group that nothing they would do as solo artists would equal what they had achieved together, and they would always carry the weight of their Beatle past. McCartney said the song was about the Beatles' business difficulties and the atmosphere at Apple at the time.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" is a song credited to Lennon/McCartney, and released in 1967, on The Beatles' album of the same name. The song appears twice on the album: as the first song (transitioning into \"With a Little Help from My Friends\"), and as \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\", (which transitions into \"A Day in the Life\"). As the title track, the lyrics introduce the fictional band that performs in the album.\nSince its original album release, the song has also been released on singles, on compilation albums, and has been performed by several other artists including Jimi Hendrix (such as at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970), U2, and a comic interpretation by Bill Cosby.\nSong structure.\nOn the \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album, the song opens to the sound of a loud audience, and an orchestra tuning up, which was taken from the February 10 orchestra session for \"A Day in the Life\". The crowd sounds edited into the song were recorded in the early '60s by Martin, during a live recording of the stage show Beyond the Fringe. When the song itself begins, the band introduces its members. The song is in G major, with a 4/4 meter. A horn quartet was used to fill out the instrumental sections.\nReprise.\n\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\" is a repeat of the song at a faster tempo with heavier instruments. While the first track stays largely in the key of G major (except for transient modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and modulates back to G. The track opens with a distorted guitar strumming a \"Hendrix chord\" (dominant 7th sharp 9). McCartney counts 1-2-3-4, and between 2 and 3, Lennon says \"bye!\".\nThe idea for a reprise was Aspinall's, who thought that as there was a \"welcome song\", there should be a \"goodbye song\". The song contains the same melody as the opening version, but with different lyrics. At 1:18, it is one of the Beatles' shorter songs (the shortest is \"Her Majesty\" at 0:23). The reprise was recorded on 1 April 1967, two months after the version that opens the album. At the end of the track, Martin's pre-recorded applause sample segues into the real final track of the album, \"A Day in the Life\".\nPersonnel.\n\"Full version:\"\n\"Reprise\":"}

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" in 1967. The song was written for and sung by Beatles drummer Ringo Starr as the character \"Billy Shears\"; it is ranked #304 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr performed this song for the first time together at the David Lynch Foundation Benefit Concert in the Radio City Music Hall, New York on 4 April 2009.\nOrigins.\nLennon and McCartney finished writing this song in mid-March 1967, written as Starr's song for the album. It was briefly called \"Bad Finger Boogie\" (later the inspiration for the band name Badfinger), because Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his forefinger; but in his 1980 \"Playboy\" interview Lennon said: \"This is Paul, with a little help from me. 'What do you see when you turn out the light/ I can't tell you, but I know it's mine...' is mine.\"\nLennon and McCartney wrote a tune with a limited range - except for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve. \nSpeaking in the Anthology, Starr insisted on changing the first line which originally was \"What would you do if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and throw tomatoes at me?\" He changed the lyric so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after George Harrison made a comment that he liked jelly babies, fans would throw them at the Beatles at all of their live shows.)\nThe song is in the form of a conversation. The other three Beatles sing a question and Starr answers, for example: \"Would you believe in a love at first sight? / Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.\"\nThe band started recording the song the day before they posed for the Sgt. Pepper album cover (29 March 1967), ending the session at 5:45 in the morning.\nCultural references.\n\"With a Little Help from My Friends\" was played as wake-up music on Space Shuttle Mission STS-61."}

Shortly after the song's release, people realized that the first letter of each of the title's nouns spelled LSD. Though Lennon denied and mocked the idea of a hidden LSD reference, the BBC banned the song. \nLater, other artists made a cover version of the song. One of them was Elton John, whose 1974 recording was at the top of the \"Billboards\" chart for two weeks.\nTitle and lyrics.\nJulian's drawing.\nAccording to the Beatles, Lennon's son, Julian Lennon showed his father a nursery school drawing he called Lucy - in the sky with diamonds, depicting his classmate, Lucy O'Donnell. \nJulian said, \"I don't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea...\" Lucy Vodden n\u00e9e O'Donnell died of an immune system disease in 2009.\nLennon was surprised at the idea that the song title was a hidden reference to LSD.\nReviews and legacy.\n\"Rolling Stone\" magazine described the song as \"Lennon's lavish daydream\" and music critic Richie Unterberger said \"'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds' was one of the best songs on the Beatles' famous Sgt. Pepper album, and one of the classic songs of psychedelia as a whole. There are few other songs that so successfully evoke a dream world, in both the sonic textures and words.\" In a review for the BBC, Chris Jones described the song as \"nursery rhyme surrealism\" that contributed to Sgt. Pepper's \"revolutionary ... sonic carpet that enveloped the ears and sent the listener spinning into other realms.\"\nIn later interviews, Lennon expressed disappointment with the Beatles' arrangement of the recording, complaining that inadequate time was taken to fully develop his initial idea for the song. He also said that he felt he didn't think that he sang it very well. \"I was so nervous I couldn't sing,\" he told the journalist Ray Connolly, \"but I like the lyrics.\"\nA 3.2 million year-old, 40% complete fossil skeleton of an \"Australopithecus afarensis\" specimen discovered in 1974 was named \"Lucy\" because the Beatles song was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp.\nThe White dwarf star BPM 37093, which contains a core of crystallized carbon roughly 4000\u00a0km in diameter, is informally named \"Lucy\" as a tribute to the Beatles song."}

This was one of a handful of songs of the Beatles in which the members did not play any instruments.\nBackground.\nPaul McCartney:\nThe newspaper story McCartney mentioned was from the front page of the \"Daily Mirror\", about a girl named Melanie Coe. Although McCartney made up most of the content, Coe, who was 17 at the time said that he got most of it right. Her parents wondered why she had left... \"She has everything here.\" In real life, Melanie did not \"meet a man from the motor trade\", but instead a croupier, and left in the afternoon while her parents were at work. She was found ten days later because she had said where her boyfriend worked.\nCoincidentally, Coe had met McCartney three years earlier when she was a contestant and prize winner on ITV's \"Ready Steady Go!\". An update on Melanie appeared in the Daily Mail in May 2008.\nRecording.\nThe day before McCartney wanted to work on the string arrangement, he learned that George Martin was not available to do the score. He contacted Mike Leander, who did it in Martin's place. It was the first time a Beatle song was not arranged by Martin (and the only time it was done with the Beatles' consent: Phil Spector's orchestration of \"Let It Be\" was done without McCartney's knowledge). Martin was hurt by McCartney's actions, but he produced the song and conducted the string section. The harp was played by Sheila Bromberg, the first female musician to appear on a Beatles record.\nThe stereo version of the song runs at a slower speed than the mono mix, and consequently is a semitone lower in pitch. This is mentioned in the booklet accompanying \"The Beatles in Mono\" CD box set, but no reason is given. A 2007 Mojo magazine article revealed the mono mix was sped up to make Paul sound younger and tighten the track.\nCritical reception.\nWhen discussing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, composer Ned Rorem described \"She's Leaving Home\" as \"equal to any song that Schubert ever wrote.\""}

He had been forced to put his ship, HM Bark Endeavour, onto the beach at the river mouth so that it could be repaired. The ship had been damaged by coral on the Great Barrier Reef. The Aboriginal Australians, the Guugu Yimithirr people, called the river \"Wabalumbaal\". \nCook and his crew stayed for seven weeks and met with the Guugu Yimithirr. The word \"kangaroo\" was a Guugu Yimithirr word for the animal which Cook wrote down in his diary. The naturalists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander made big collections of native plants and flowers, while Sydney Parkinson made pictures of the flora and fauna of the region. \nThe Endeavour River is very wide at its mouth where it meets the sea. Upstream it quickly branches into many small creeks. There are 25 species of mangrove grwoing along the river. Saltwater crocodiles live in the river, and can often be seen on the banks during the winter in June and July. In October 2008, a man fishing for crabs on the river bank was taken by a crocodile. At first people thought it was a big crocodile, more than six metres in length. But his remains were later found inside a crocodile. The river is also a good place to go fishing for barramundi. \nIn recent years, tilapia fish, which are a \"noxious species\" in Australia, have moved into the river in large numbers. Scientists are worried that this will harm the numbers of native fish. These fish, which are often farmed for food in other countries, are listed in the worst 100 introduced species. A person in Australia owning or selling a tilapia could be fined up to AU$11,000.\nThere is now a town, Cooktown, at the mouth of the Endeavour River. About 2000 people live in the town. Cooktown is the northernmost town on the east coast of Australia. It was first settled in 1873, at the site of Cook's landing. It was a port for the newly discovered Palmer River Goldfields. Some of the relatively undisturbed natural features near the mouth of the river have been protected as a Queensland National Park, the Endeavour River National Park.\nReferences.\nSources:"}

Her father was an engineer and after his death in 1946, Ullmann returned to Norway with her mother and older sister, where they settled in Trondheim. \nAfter high school, she decided on an acting career.

She nonetheless persevered and after some studies at the Webber School of Acting in London, she eventually found work with a repertory theatre company in Stavenger. She also began appearing in bit parts in movies and on television. \nShe got her first major break when she met Swedish director Ingmar Bergman who offered her a role in his movie \"Persona\" (1966), opposite Bibi Anderson. She became his muse and lover and went on starring in several of his movies to considerable acclaim; \"Hour of the Wolf\" (1968), \"Shame\" (1968), \"The Passion of Anna\" (1969), \"Cries and Whispers\" (1972), \"Scenes of a Marriage\" (1973), \"Face to Face\" (1975), \"The Serpent's Egg\" (1977), \"Autumn Sonata\" (1978) and \"Saraband\" (2003).\nShe also appeared in Jan Troell's epic movie \"The Emigrants\" (1971) and its sequel \"The New Land\" (1972), which earned her an Academy Award nomination as best actress. \nAfter her break up with Bergman in the early 1970s, she went to Hollywood and appeared in movies such as \"Pope Joan\" (1972), \"New Horizons\" (1973), \"Forty Carats\" (1973), \"The Abdication\" (1974), \"Zandy's Bride\" (1974), but failed to establish herself as the new Nordic star like Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman before her.\nShe published two autobiographies \"Changing\" (1977) and \"Choices\" (1984), in which she candidly discussed her life and career. \nIn the 1990s, she turned to directing with movies including \"Sofie\" (1992) and \"Kristin Lavransdotter\" (1995).

This chapter, along with chapter 13, is referred to as deuterocanonical, in that it is not universally accepted among Christians as belonging to the Bible. The story is typically not included in Protestant Bibles.\nIt is believed by some scholars to have been written in the late 2nd century BC and accounted apocryphal by Protestants. The chapter is formed of three independent narratives, which place the culture-hero Daniel at the court of Cyrus, king of the Persians: \"When King Astyages was laid to rest with his ancestors, Cyrus the Persian succeeded to his kingdom.\" There Daniel \"was a companion of the king, and was the most honored of all his Friends\" (14:1).\nThe narrative of Bel (14:1\u201322) is a folk tale ridiculing worship. In it, the king asks Daniel \"Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?\" Daniel proves through a ruse that the sacred meal of Bel is actually consumed at night by the seventy priests and their wives and children, who entered through a secret door when the temple's doors were sealed. The priests and their wives and children are killed, and Daniel is permitted to destroy the idol of Bel and the temple. This version has been cited as an ancestor of the \"locked room mystery\". \nIn the brief companion narrative of the Dragon (14:23\u201330), \"there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered.\" In this case the supposed god is no idol, but not all that eats is divine: Daniel slew the dragon by making cakes of pitch, fat and hair. The dragon ate them and burst open. Now the Babylonians were indignant. \"The king has become a Jew; he has destroyed Bel, and killed the dragon, and slaughtered the priests,\" they said, and demanded that Daniel be handed over to them.\nThe third narrative (14:31\u201342), Daniel in the Lions' Den, is apparently Daniel's 1st or 2nd trip. It has been made into a consequence of the preceding episode, but the Septuagint precedes it with the notice: \"From the prophecy of Habakkuk, son of Jesus, of the tribe of Levi.\" Daniel remained unharmed in the den with seven lions, fed by the miraculous transportation of the prophet Habakkuk. \"On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den he looked in, and there sat Daniel! The king shouted with a loud voice, \"You are great, O Lord, the God of Daniel, and there is no other besides you!\" Then he pulled Daniel out, and threw into the den those who had attempted his destruction, and they were instantly eaten before his eyes.\" Some have suggested that the Daniel in Bel and the Dragon is different from that of Daniel 1-13.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, the song was \"aimed chiefly at parents, and as a result got a cool reception from the group's own generation.\"\nComposition.\nThe song is sung by a young man to his lover, and is about his plans of growing old together with her. Although the theme is aging, it was one of the first songs McCartney wrote, when he was sixteen. The Beatles used it in the early days as a song they could play when the amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn thought that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for \"Sgt. Pepper\" in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year.\nLennon said of the song, \"Paul wrote it in the Cavern days. We just stuck a few more words on it like 'grandchildren on your knee' and 'Vera, Chuck and Dave' ... this was just one that was quite a hit with us.\" In his 1980 interview for \"Playboy\" he said, \"I would never even dream of writing a song like that.\"\nRecording.\nThe song was recorded on 6 December 1966, during one of the first sessions for the as-yet-unnamed album that became \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". There were multiple overdub sessions, including the lead vocal by McCartney on 8 December and backing vocals by McCartney, Lennon, and George Harrison on 20 December. The clarinets were recorded on 21 December.\nThe song is in the key of D-flat major. The Beatles recorded the song in C major but the master take was sped up in order to raise the key by one semitone at the insistence of McCartney. Martin remembers that McCartney suggested this change in order to make his voice sound younger. McCartney says, \"I wanted to appear younger, but that was just to make it more rooty-tooty; just lift the key because it was starting to sound turgid.\"\nRelease.\nThe song was nearly released on a single as the B-side with either \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" or \"Penny Lane\" as the A-side. Instead, Martin decided on a double-A-sided-disc. The single did not make #1 in the UK, breaking a string of #1 singles going back to 1963. If \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" had been issued as a B-side, it probably would not have appeared on \"Sgt. Pepper\"."}

It was founded by former driver Adri\u00e1n Campos, and first known as Campos Meta 1. The team was taken over by Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carabante and renamed HRT. The team made its debut in the season. It is the first Spanish team to race in Formula One. A previous Spanish effort known as Bravo F1 tried but failed to enter the sport in .\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe team began as a collaboration between Adri\u00e1n Campos of Campos Racing and Enrique Rodr\u00edguez of Meta Image, under the name of Campos Meta. Campos Racing currently runs a team in the European F3 Open Championship. They also used to run the GP2 Series team now known as Addax Team. Campos was running the Formula One operation in conjunction with Meta Image. Meta Image is a Madrid-based sports agency, who managed one of Campos' F3 Open drivers, Bruno M\u00e9ndez. Campos and Rodr\u00edguez began looking at the possibility of creating Spain's first Formula One team in February 2009. In March, the team gained shareholders (investors) such as Spanish businessman Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carabante and basketball players Pau Gasol and Jorge Garbajosa.\nThe team's headquarters were first located at Meta Images's offices in Madrid, housing marketing and administration. Its technical centre is located at Campos Racing's headquarters in Alzira, Valencia. In October 2009 the team completed a deal with the local government of the Region of Murcia to build new facilities for the team at the Parque Tecnol\u00f3gico Fuente \u00c1lamo de Murcia science park. Italian constructor Dallara built the 2010 cars in Parma, which used Cosworth engines.\nOn June 12, Campos Meta were named by the FIA as one of three new teams granted entry to the 2010 season..\nOn the weekend of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Campos confirmed that Bruno Senna, the nephew of former world champion Ayrton Senna, would be one of their racing drivers for 2010.\nFinancial struggles and rebranding.\nIn January 2010, A1 Grand Prix principal Tony Teixeira was one of several potential investors linked to the team. The investors were an effort to open up revenue for the 2010 pre-season testing. On January 27, the team admitted that they may not be able to participate in the 2010 pre-season testing, and that their second driver may not be announced until the eve of their first race. Teixeira said the team was aiming to make the second test session and believed that they would \"definitely\" make the third session at Jerez.\nOn 5 February 2010, Campos boss Adri\u00e1n Campos told BBC Sport that the team were struggling to find funding. It was paying \u20ac7 million to Dallara stating that \"sometime we have the money sometime we don't\". He also denied that F1 hopeful Stefan GP had taken the Campos' car. He stated that \"we've got a contract and as long as we're paying the contract is valid\". In February, speculation began as to whether Campos would actually make the 2010 field. The team admitted budgetary problems. \nOn February 19, it was announced that majority shareholder Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carabante had taken over full control of the team from Adri\u00e1n Campos. Colin Kolles also replaced him as team principal. The team was re-named to Hispania Racing F1 Team (HRT), with the name taken from Grupo Hispania, one of Carabante's companies. The team's headquarters were moved to Grupo Hispania's offices in Murcia. On March 4, Karun Chandhok was confirmed as the team's second driver. The team launched their Cosworth-powered, Dallara-designed car on the same day; it was called the Hispania F110.\n2010 season.\nWith no pre-season testing, the F110 completed its first laps during the weekend of the Bahrain Grand Prix. Senna's car was completed in time for him to complete three installation (first test lap) laps in the first free practice session. In the second session, he completed 17\u00a0laps, running over 11\u00a0seconds off the pace. He then slid off the track after his wheel came loose. Senna described the day's work as a \"great start\", considering the team's lack of preparation. \nChandhok's did not complete any laps in the Friday practice. The mechanics were unable to make the clutch and gearbox on the car work. In qualifying, Senna and Chandhok set the two slowest times to share the back row of the starting grid: Chandhok was finally able to complete his car's first laps at speed. \nFor the race, both cars started from the pit lane. Chandhok crashed on the second lap and was out of the race. Senna retired on lap\u00a018 with an overheating engine. Hispania finally had both car finish the race at the Malaysian Grand Prix with Chandhok finishing in front of Senna. Chandhok was 3 laps down and Senna was 4 laps down. \nIn Turkish Grand Prix, the team's test driver Sakon Yamamoto completed the first practice session, and ran the slowest time of the session.\nOn the eve of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Hispania announced that Bruno Senna had been dropped for the race. Yest driver Sakon Yamamoto would race in his place. After the race, HRT announced that Senna would return after Silverstone. Yamamoto has replaced Chandhok for the German Grand Prix and the Hungarian Grand Prix.\n2011 Season.\nHispania parted company with Dallara in May 2010. The partnership between the two companies had become tense due to the car's lack of performance. The team is seeking a new technical deal to assist in the construction of its chassis.\nWhen Hispania was still under the Campos name, team owner Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carabante said in an interview with Autosport that Campos Meta F1/HRT were eyeing a Ferrari engine supply for the season. Colin Kolles said in an interview with Diario AS in July 2010, that talks about a partnership with Toyota was an option for 2011. Hispania continues to use Cosworth engines for 2011.\nThe first race of the 2011 season was the Australian Grand Prix. Hispania was not ready to race yet. The new chassis, the F111, had not been ready during the off season testing. During the weekend at Australia, the team was still putting the cars together. Karthikeyan and Liuzzi had to qualify in cars without any practice. Because of this, they were not fast enough to qualify for the race.\nThe fastest lap time during the first qualifying session was 1m\u00a025.296s. Based on the new 107% rule, the minimum qualifying time was 1m\u00a031.266s. Both Hispania cars were at least one second slower than the minimum time.\nComplete Formula One results.\n Season in progress."}

It can also be used for smoking herbal fruits.\nThe hookah gained popularity under the reign of the Ottoman Dynasty. A hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat.\nHistory.\nThe hookah has origins in Arabia, Persia, Turkey, India and ancient China. Ancient Persian paintings depict people smoking hookahs. In the early 19th century, Hookahs became popular with rich men, who often smoked them wearing smoking caps or fezzes and smoking jackets.\nThe more colloquial terms \"hubble-bubble\" and \"hubbly-bubbly\" may be used in the region surrounding the Red Sea.\nThe archaic form of this latter Indian name \"hookah\" is most commonly used in English for historical reasons. It was in India that many English-speakers first sampled the effects of the water pipe. The writer William Hickey wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that shortly after his arrival in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India in 1775:\nSmoking the hookah.\nThe jar at the bottom of the hookah is filled with water sufficient to submerge a few inches of the body tube, which is sealed tightly to it. Deeper water will only increase the inhalation force needed to use it. Tobacco or tobacco-free molasses are placed inside the bowl at the top of the hookah. Often the bowl is covered with perforated tin foil or a metal screen and coal placed on top. The foil or screen separates the coal and the tobacco, which minimizes inhalation of coal ash with the smoke and reduces the temperature the tobacco is exposed to, in order to prevent burning the tobacco directly.\nWhen one inhales through the hose, air is pulled through the charcoal and into the bowl holding the tobacco. The hot air, heated by the charcoal vaporizes the tobacco without burning it.\nThe vapor is passed down through the body tube that extends into the water in the jar. It bubbles up through the water, losing heat, and fills the top part of the jar, to which the hose is attached. When a smoker inhales from the hose, smoke passes into the lungs, and the change in pressure in the jar pulls more air through the charcoal, continuing the process.\nThe hookah in modern times.\nHookahs are widely used today. At parties, some people choose to smoke a hookah and spread it around for others to use. Hookah bars are places where people can meet up and smoke hookahs. Nowadays, hookahs appear in numerous designs, shapes, and sizes, from classic Egyptian look to modern and futuristic. \nHealth.\nA 2005 WHO report states that smoking using a waterpipe poses a serious potential health hazard and is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. The average hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke of a cigarette."}

After the PLO leadership and its Fatah brigade were expelled from Jordan in 1971 for fomenting a revolt, they entered Lebanon and internal and cross-border violence increased. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had already recruited militants in Lebanon from among the families of Palestinian refugees who were expelled or fled due to the creation of Israel in 1948. By 1968, the PLO and Israel were committing cross border attacks against each other. Meanwhile, demographic tensions over the Lebanese National Pact led to the Lebanese Civil War (1975\u20131990). PLO was one of the key factors to the eruption of the Lebanese Civil War and its bitter battles with Lebanese factions caused foreign intervention. Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon pushed the PLO north of the Litani River, but the PLO continued their campaign against Israel. Israel invaded Lebanon again in 1982, in alliance with major Lebanese Christian militias, and forcibly expelled the PLO. Israel withdrew to a slim borderland buffer zone, held with the aid of proxy militants in the South Lebanon Army (SLA). Israel and Lebanon signed the May 17 Agreement providing a framework for the establishment of normal bilateral relations between the two countries, but relations were disrupted with takeover of Shia and Druze militias in early 1984.\nIn 1985, a Lebanese Shi'te resistance movement sponsored by Iran, calling itself Hezbollah, called for armed struggle to \"end the Israel occupation of Lebanese territory\". When the Lebanese civil war ended and other warring factions agreed to disarm, Hezbollah and the SLA refused. Combat with Hezbollah weakened Israeli resolve and led to a collapse of the SLA and an Israeli withdrawal in 2000 to their side of the UN designated border. Citing Israeli control of the Shebaa farms territory, Hezbollah continued cross border attacks intermittently over the next six years. Hezbollah now sought freedom for Lebanese citizens in Israeli prisons and successfully used the tactic of capturing Israeli soldiers as leverage for a prisoner exchange in 2004. The capturing of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah ignited the 2006 Lebanon War. Its ceasefire called for the disarmament of Hezbollah and the remaining armed camps of the PLO, and for Lebanon to control its southern border militarily for the first time in four decades.\nHostilities were suspended on 8 September 2006. As of 2009 Hezbollah had not disarmed. On 18 June 2008, Israel declared that it was open to peace talks with Lebanon."}

The conflict has gone on since 1948.\nThe Arab\u2013Israeli conflict began from earlier tensions between the Arab and Jewish communities in British Mandatory Palestine, with the rise of two nationalist movements - Zionist movement among Jews and Arab nationalism among the Arabs. The ethnic conflict in Mandatory Palestine was also a result of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which created tension over the division and ownership of the land. While the Jewish people saw the land as their historical homeland of the Land of Israel, the Palestinian people and Pan-Arab movement saw the land as Palestine belonging to the Arabs and in the Pan-Islamic context, as territory regarded as Muslim lands.\nThe modern conflict started with the 1948 Arab-Israeli war in parallel with the creation of state of Israel by the Jews. Later, on the course of the 1948 War, the All-Palestine Government was created in Gaza Strip by the Arab League, as an Arab Palestinian state. Israel won the 1948 war, and the All-Palestine Government moved to Cairo in Egypt and were not allowed to return to Gaza. They gradually lost importance, until abolished in 1959 by the Egyptian President Nasser.\nIn 1964, another Palestinian political organization was formed by Yasser Arafat (named Palestinian Liberation Organization), and became the most important Palestinian movement. In 1967, Arab countries and Israel fought the Six-Day War, resulting in Israeli takeover of Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, West Bank from Jordan and Golan Heights from Syria. Jordan, Egypt and PLO soon began a low-level War of Attrition, which lasted from 1967 to 1970 with no significant benefits to any side. In 1973, another major war, the Yom Kippur War, was started by Egypt and Syria to regain the territory lost in the Six Day War. Egypt liberated part of the Sinai, and Syria was pushed back to Damascus. Egypt and Israel both claimed victory and till now historians argue as to whom the victory belongs to.\nOver the years, it has changed from the large-scale Arab\u2013Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though the Arab World and Israel still disagree with each other over specific territory."}

This was after a six-month truce between Israel and Hamas had run out and Hamas had resumed rocket attacks against Israel. Israel's said its aim was to stop Hamas' rocket attacks on Israel from and arms import into the territory. Israeli forces attacked military targets, police stations and government buildings. Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against Southern Israel, reaching the major cities of Beersheba and Ashdod for the first time. An Israeli ground invasion began on January 3, 2009. The war ended on January 18, when Israel first declared a unilateral(one-sided) ceasefire, followed by Hamas' announcing a one-week ceasefire twelve hours later. Israel completed its withdrawal on January 21. The conflict resulted in between 1,166 and 1,417 Palestinian and 13 Israeli deaths."}

D'umo (n\u00e9e Cortopassi born September 11, 1973), also known as Nappytabs, are husband and wife choreographers who are often credited with developing the new style of hip-hop dance known as lyrical hip-hop. They have been working together in the dance industry since 1996 and are best known for their choreography on the TV show \"So You Think You Can Dance\". They were nominated for a 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for their work on the fourth season of the show. Napoleon and Tabitha were also supervising choreographers on MTV's \"America's Best Dance Crew\" for the first five seasons.\nNapoleon and Tabitha started their career in Las Vegas while they were still in college choreographing industrial musicals for large businesses. After moving to Los Angeles, they began teaching hip-hop dance classes and choreographing for professional basketball and football dance teams including the Orlando Magic and the Dallas Cowboys. Their career improved to choreographing music videos, commercials, movies, television shows, and concerts. Napoleon and Tabitha have worked with entertainers such as Missy Elliott, Celine Dion, Kanye West, Ricky Martin, and Jennifer Lopez. They have also choreographed for Cirque Du Soleil. In addition to choreography and teaching classes, they direct concert tours and live events and have their own dance clothing line called \"Nappytabs\".\nEarly life.\nWhile growing up in Victorville, California, Napoleon learned how to dance by traveling to Los Angeles and spending time with b-boys; he was eventually cast as an extra in the movie \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo\" in 1984. After graduating from Apple Valley High School, Napoleon joined the US military and was sent to Germany. After he was discharged from the military, he attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) where he majored in molecular biology. In college, Napoleon started taking jazz dance and modern dance classes. He eventually received a full scholarship as a member of the university's dance team.\nTabitha grew up in Galloway, New Jersey. Her mother enrolled her in jazz dance classes when she was young. Since there were no hip-hop classes, Tabitha learned by watching music videos and participating in her high school's cheer and dance teams. She names Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Paula Abdul as influences. After graduating from Absegami High School, Tabitha moved to Nevada to attend UNLV where she majored in communications and started taking hip-hop dance classes. It was there that she met her future husband Napoleon.\nTabitha and Napoleon started their professional partnership in 1996 while still in college as part of the dance company Culture Shock. During their time with Culture Shock, they choreographed a variety of industrial musicals\u2014musicals performed for the employees of a business to motivate/entertain\u2014for companies such as Nike, Levi, Redken, Matrix Hair, and MAC. Although Tabitha was planning to take a job in public relations and Napoleon was planning to attend medical school, they both decided when they graduated college to pursue a career in the dance industry.\nCareer.\nChoreography.\nNapoleon and Tabitha have choreographed for sports teams, movies, television, and for the stage. They have choreographed for NFL and NBA dance teams including the Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, Chicago Bulls, and Orlando Magic. Some of the celebrities they have worked with include Sean Kingston, Jennifer Lopez, Carrie Underwood, Celine Dion, Missy Elliott, Destiny's Child, and Timbaland.\nNapoleon and Tabitha were supervising choreographers for \"America's Best Dance Crew\" from season one in 2008 to season five in 2010. Also in 2008, Napoleon and Tabitha joined the choreography team on Fox's \"So You Think You Can Dance\" (SYTYCD). It was on this show that their lyrical hip-hop style gained popularity. The term \"lyrical hip-hop\" was created by SYTYCD judge Adam Shankman when he commented on a routine choreographed by Napoleon and Tabitha to Leona Lewis' song \"Bleeding Love\".\nThis routine was later nominated for a 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography. In an interview with DanceInforma.com Tabitha stated that they do not create choreography without a story because the story determines the movement and the feeling they want to show: \"We listen to the song over and over and over and finally we find that skeleton and then we can start preparing some steps.\"\nIn April 2009, Napoleon and Tabitha choreographed three dance routines for the second season of \"So You Think You Can Dance Australia\". SYTYCD Australia judge and choreographer Matt Lee called their \"Dead and Gone\" lyrical hip-hop routine the best routine of the season. Later that year in September, Napoleon and Tabitha choreographed the opening dance performance on the season seven premiere of The Ellen Degeneres Show. The performance featured both DeGeneres and the top 10 dancers from season five of \"So You Think You Can Dance\".\nIn February 2010, Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed Cirque Du Soleil's \"Viva ELVIS\" show at the Aria Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. In July, they choreographed a hip-hop routine for Seattle Theatre Group's 12th Annual \"DANCE This\" concert. In September, they choreographed a pilot episode for another dance television show called \"MOBBED\". The following year, \"MOBBED\" expanded to a series and Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed another ten episodes.\nTeaching.\nNapoleon and Tabitha spend a lot of time teaching classes at dance studios and conventions\u2014regional educational events hosted by professional dancers. They have taught hip-hop dance at Millennium Dance Complex, the Edge Performing Arts Center, Xtreme Dance Force, Shock the Intensive, Coastal Dance Rage, iHollywood, and Monsters of Hip Hop dance conventions. They were guest instructors at Project 818 in Moscow, Russia and judges at the 2009 Australian Hip Hop Championships in Sydney.\nDirecting.\nMost of Napoleon and Tabitha's work is in choreography and teaching but they have also provided creative direction for tours and live events. Creative directors are responsible for the design, vision, and theme of a show. In 2006 and 2007, they served as assistant creative directors for Christina Aguilera\u2019s \"Back to Basics Tour\" and for Ricky Martin\u2019s \"Black and White Tour\". In 2008, they were assistant creative directors for Celine Dion's \"Taking Chances Tour\" and Kanye West\u2019s \"Glow in the Dark Tour\". They were the lead creative directors for \"Monsters of Hip Hop: The Show\", the \"So You Think You Can Dance Tour\", and \"America's Best Dance Crew Live\".\nIn 2009, they directed the second \"So You Think You Can Dance Tour\" and in 2010 they directed the Jabbawockeez' \"M\u00dcS.I.C\" (muse-i-see) show at the MGM Grand Las Vegas hotel and casino. In 2013, Tabitha and Napoleon directed a new show for the Jabbawockeez called \"PRiSM\".\nProjects.\nNapoleon and Tabitha have their own line of dance clothing line called \"Nappytabs\". \"Nappytabs\" is the first line of hip-hop dance clothing. They decided to create it because of the lack of appropriate dance clothing for urban hip-hop dancers. For this reason, it is only sold at selected regional dance clothing stores, major dance conventions, online through the \"Nappytabs\" official website, and at their only retail location and dance studio in North Hollywood.\nIn 2007, Tabitha was the host of an exercise DVD titled \"Drop it with Dance\".\nThe video is split into six 10-minute routines that gradually increase in difficulty; movements from all six routines are combined in the finale \"Showtime\" segment. Tabitha also appeared in \"Rock Your Body\", a dance/fitness DVD hosted by choreographer and creative director Jamie King who is known primarily for his work with Madonna.\nNapoleon and Tabitha appeared in the dance documentary \"MOVE\". The movie is about dance as an art form and how notable choreographers were able to go from dancing as a hobby to dancing as a career. There are over fifty dance professionals who appear in this movie including director and choreographer Kenny Ortega.\nAwards and recognition.\nIn 2009, Tabitha and Napoleon were nominated for an Emmy Award for the lyrical hip-hop routine \"Bleeding Love\" that they choreographed on season four of \"So You Think You Can Dance\". On September 10, 2011, they won an Emmy Award for three routines they choreographed on season seven\u2014\"Scars\", \"Fallin'\", and \"Outta Your Mind\".

According to the Gospel of Matthew, the star made the magi travel to Jerusalem. There they met King Herod of Judea, and asked where the king of the Jews had been born. Herod's advisors said that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, a nearby village, because of a prophecy in the Book of Micah. While the magi were going to Bethlehem, they saw the star again. The star stopped above the place where Jesus was born. There, the magi saw Jesus with his mother, worshipped him and gave costly presents to him. They then returned to their \"own country\".\nChristians usually think of the star as a miraculous sign to show the birth of the Christ. Astronomers have thought of many different explanations for the star. A nova, a planet, a comet, an occultation, and a conjunction (planets coming together) have all been suggested.\nSome scholars say that the story is not historically right and that the star was not real.\nThe Star of Bethlehem is a well-loved subject at planetarium shows during Christmas, but the Bible seems to suggest that the magi visited Jesus at least several months after he was born. The visit is usually celebrated on Epiphany (January 6) in Western Christianity and on Christmas (December 25) in Eastern Christianity.\nBiblical story.\nThe Gospel of Matthew says that Magi (usually translated as \"wise men\", but probably meaning here \"astronomer\" or \"astrologer\") came to the court of Herod in Jerusalem and told the king of a star which marked the birth of the King of the Jews:\nNow after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold (see), wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, \"Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East\" [or \"at its rising\"] \"and have come to worship Him.\" When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them (asked) where the Christ was to be born.\nHerod was \"troubled\"\u2013not about the star, but because a \"king of the Jews\" had been born. He understood that this meant the Messiah. The Messiah was a leader of the Jewish people, and had been spoken of in Old Testament prophecies. So he asked his helpers where the Messiah would be born. They replied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, the place where King David was born, remembering what the prophet Micah had said. The king told this to the magi.\nThen Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, \"Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also.\" When they heard the king, they departed (went away); and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly (very) great joy.\nMatthew suggests that the magi knew from the star that the \"king of the Jews\" had already been born even before they entered Jerusalem. They gave Jesus gold, frankincense, and myrrh as presents. The magi were told in a dream not to go back to Jerusalem. So, they \"left for their own country by another road\". When Herod found out that he had been tricked, he ordered all male children in Bethlehem who were 2 or younger to be killed. Joseph was warned in a dream to escape. He took his family to Egypt to be safe. The Gospel connects the escape to a verse from the Old Testament, which is seen as a prophecy: \"Out of Egypt I called My Son.\" The Old Testament verse was about how the Hebrews went away from Egypt, led by Moses. Because of this, the quote seems to suggest that Matthew thought that Jesus' life was like the story of the Jewish people. Judea could have symbolized Egypt and Herod represented pharaoh. After Herod died, God called Joseph and his family back from Egypt, and they settled in to Nazareth in Galilee.\nDiscovering the year Jesus was born.\nOne way to interpret the Star of Bethlehem is to find the year in which Jesus was born. Matthew wrote that Jesus was born when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died shortly after a lunar eclipse. This lunar eclipse is often thought of as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Those who ruled after Herod used coins showing that they dated their rules as beginning in 4 BC. Because of this, it is mostly thought that Herod died that year. However, some still disagree with this idea.\nExplanations.\nFulfillment of prophecy.\nFrom long ago, many people believed that the movements of the stars were connected with the things that happened on earth. Miracles were often thought to happen at the same time important people were born.\nThe Star of Bethlehem is traditionally linked to the Star Prophecy in the Book of Numbers:\nBy the time the Gospels were written, it was thought by many people that it was about the coming of a Messiah. For example, Josephus quoted it (though he thought it was about Emperor Vespasian).\nIn art.\nPaintings and other works of art about the magi's visit may include the star. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is in the shape of a comet. In a tapestry about the Magi, designed by Edward Burne-Jones, the star is held by an angel.\nChristmas songs.\nChristmas songs often describe the Star of Bethlehem. For example, \"We Three Kings\" has the words:\nO star of wonder, star of light,&lt;br&gt;\nStar with royal beauty bright,&lt;br&gt;\nWestward leading, still proceeding,&lt;br&gt;\nGuide us to thy perfect light.&lt;br&gt;"}

It was home to several classic rides including the \"Little Dipper\" roller coaster, which opened in 1950. The park closed on September 27, 2009, at 8 PM, and demolished in 2010 to make way for a new Costco store.\nHistory.\nKiddieland started out as a small venture of Arthur Fritz in 1929 when he purchased six ponies and offered rides as an escape for parents reeling from the Great Depression. Miniature gasoline-powered cars were added a few years later after Fritz learned that they were being given away to children by a Chicago newspaper as a subscription promotion.\nIn 1940, the \"German Carousel\", two Miniature Steam Locomotives, the \"Little Auto Ride\", the \"Roto Whip\" and the \"Ferris Wheel\" were added. The latter two lasted until the park's closing. The park saw its first major expansion in the 1950s with the addition of the Little Dipper and the Carousel, of which both still exist today. Bumper cars were added in the 1960s as they replaced the original pony ride.\nThe park transferred ownership in 1977, as Arthur Fritz's grandchildren took over the park and its operation. The park continued its expansion and installed several major attractions, including a Log flume, a swinging pirate ship, a long water coaster, and numerous other attractions.\nClosure.\nA dispute developed between Shirley and Glenn Rynes, who own the land that Kiddieland occupies, and Ronald Rynes, Jr. and Cathy and Tom Norini, who own the amusement park itself. The landowners sued the park owners in 2004, claiming that the park had an improper insurance policy and that fireworks were prohibited in the lease. The case was thrown out in a Cook County court and later in an appeals court. The landowners declined to extend the lease on the land in early 2009. In late June 2010, it was announced that Kiddieland would be demolished, nine months after the park closed to the public. A Costco store will be built in its place.\nThe Little Dipper.\nThe Litter Dipper was designed by Herbert Schmeck and built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company in 1950. The brakes are operated manually by a wooden handle in the station. The out-and-back coaster is tall and travels a course of . It was awarded the ACE Coaster Classic award by the American Coaster Enthusiasts.\nSix Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois bought the ride in November 2009 at a Kiddieland auction. They paid $33,000 for the ride equipment at the auction."}

It is about 2 miles from the border with England. It is the county town of Monmouthshire, and just under 9,000 people live there. The River Wye and the River Monnow meet in Monmouth.\nHistory.\nThe Romans built a small fort there called \"Blestium\", but few people lived in the area after the Romans left. Eventually, the Normans built a castle by the River Monnow, after they conquered England in 1066. Monmouth grew in the Middle Ages, with a priory church, and a market street (now called Monnow Street). This street ran between the castle and a fortified bridge across the river, which is the only fortified bridge of its type in Britain. King Henry V of England was born in Monmouth Castle in 1387, but the castle itself was mostly knocked down after the Civil War in the seventeenth century.\nMonmouth was well known at one time for producing Monmouth caps - a sort of woollen headgear worn by soldiers, sailors and others. It also became famous at the end of the eighteenth century, when people such as Admiral Nelson, and many poets and painters, came to visit the beautiful Wye valley nearby. The town also has a famous public school, Monmouth School, which was started in 1615.\nIn 1840, an important trial took place in Monmouth, of Chartists who had protested that more people should be allowed to vote in elections. One of the first makers of cars in Britain, Charles Rolls who founded Rolls Royce, was born just outside the town. He was killed in an airplane crash in 1910 at the age of 33; there is a statue of him in the town centre.\nThe town today.\nThe town is known for its schools and its many shops, as well as for the services that it provides for its surrounding area. The hills around Monmouth are covered with woodland and farms. Monmouth is linked by the A40 road to the M4 motorway at Newport and the M50 at Ross-on-Wye. The town is twinned with Carbonne, France and Waldbronn, Germany.\nIn 2011, MonmouthpediA was set up as the first Wikipedia project to cover a whole town."}

Only a certain number of a driver's best results would count. In this caused a very unusual result. Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were the drivers for McLaren. They were the best two drivers of that year. There were 16 races that year, but only the best 11 results counted towards the championship. Prost won seven races and finished seven races in second place. He scored a total of 105 points, but only 87 of them counted for the championship. Senna won eight races and finished second in three, giving him 90 points for the championship and 94 for the season. This resulted in the strange event where Prost took a record number of points, yet Senna won the champion. A new system counting all races was introduced in . One additional point was also awarded to the race winner.\nThe current system was introduced for the season.

Nearly half of the circuit is across the Northamptonshire boundary in Buckinghamshire. The closest large towns are Northampton and Milton Keynes. It is best known as the home of the British Grand Prix, which it first hosted in 1948 and which has been held on the circuit every year since 1987. The circuit is also home to the BRDC International Trophy, awarded to the winner of a race for historic F1 cars at the annual Silverstone Classic meeting.\nCircuit development.\nSilverstone Circuit is built on the site of RAF Silverstone, a World War II Royal Air Force bomber station. RAF Silverstone opened in 1943.\nSilverstone was first used for racing by a group of friends who set up their own race in September 1947. Maurice Geoghegan, lived in Silverstone village and was knew that the airfield was deserted. He and eleven other drivers raced over a two-mile circuit. Geoghegan's car ran over a sheep and killed it. The car was beyond repair. This informal race became known as the \"Mutton Grand Prix\".\nThe next year the Royal Automobile Club leased the airfield and set-up a more formal racing circuit. Their first two races were held on the runways, with long straights and tight hairpin corners. For 1948, it was decided to switch to the perimeter track. This arrangement was used for the and British Grands Prix. Several small changes were made in the track before the track underwent a major redesign after the race.\nFollowing the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix, many Grand Prix circuits were modified in order to reduce speed and increase driver safety. The entry from Hangar Straight into Stowe Corner was modified in 1995 so as to make its entry less dangerous and less challenging. The high speed Abbey kink was changed to a chicane in just 19 days before the Grand Prix.\nSpectator traffic management.\nSilverstone has suffered with bad traffic delays on race days. The traffic problem was improved when the A43 Silverstone bypass was built. When the race date was moved to April in 2000] heavy rain turned the fields used for parking into mud pits, causing severe problems for the spectators trying to park. On F1 race day many spectators travel to the circuit by helicopter. Silverstone Heliport is the busiest airport in the UK for this day.\nHosting Grands Prix and Formula One.\nSilverstone is the current home of the British Grand Prix, which it first hosted in 1948. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly created Formula One World Championship. The race rotated between Silverstone, Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986. In 1987 the rotation stopped and the race stayed at Silverstone.\nIn 2004, Silverstone was in danger of losing the Grand Prix. There was even the possibility that the British Grand Prix would not be run in 2005. In December an agreement was reached with Formula One Silverstone would host the British Grand Prix until 2009. Starting in 2010 Donington Park would become the new host of the British Grand Prix. Then the Donington Park leaseholders ran into economic problems. A new deal with Formula One resulted in a 17-year deal to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.\nOther competitions.\nThe Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship withdrew the track from its calendar in 2007. Strong demand brought the series back to Silverstone for the 2008 BTCC calendar. Silverstone also hosts rounds of the FIA GT, British Superbikes, British F3, British GT and Le Mans Series championships as well as many club racing series. It is also host to the UK's only 24-hour car race, the Britcar 24, which is gaining in popularity, having first started in 2005.\nIt has in the past hosted exhibition rounds of the D1 Grand Prix both in 2005 and 2006. The course makes use of both Brooklands and Luffield corners to form an S-bend \u2013 a requirement in drifting. The section is currently used to host a European Drift Championship round. The Course also hosts the Formula Student Competition by the iMeche yearly.\nIn 2010 Silverstone hosted its very first Superleague Formula event.\nRedevelopment for motorcycle racing.\nBoth the FIM and Silverstone agree the circuit needs to be remodeled for motorcycle racing. The riders are concerned over the closeness of the bridge at Bridge corner.\nOn 22 January 2010 it was confirmed that Silverstone would host the British round of the 2010 Superbike World Championship season. The race was moved after Donington Park was deemed \"un-raceable\".\nCurrent circuit configurations.\nLike most racing circuits around the world, the Silverstone Circuit has a number of different layouts. The layouts offer different lengths and complexity."}

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", written and sung by Paul McCartney, although as with all McCartney-written Beatles songs it is credited to Lennon/McCartney. It is about a female parking attendant and the narrator's love for her.\nInspiration.\nThe term \"meter-maid\" was largely unknown in the UK prior to the song's release. It is American slang for a female traffic warden, now officially known by the gender-neutral term parking attendant. According to some sources, the song emanates from when a female traffic warden named Meta Davis gave a parking ticket to McCartney outside Abbey Road Studios. Instead of becoming angry, he accepted it with good grace and expressed his feelings in song. When asked why he had called her \"Rita\", McCartney replied, \"Well, she looked like a Rita to me\".\nRecording.\nRecording began on 23 February 1967. Using a four-track recorder, this first performance featured Harrison's guitar on track 1, Lennon's guitar on track 2, Ringo's drums on track 3, and McCartney's piano set on track 4. The band later added lead vocal, bass, and a three-part backing vocal section. By 21 March, the final mono mix was completed and a month later, the stereo mix was done.\nThe unusual noises during the song after the lines \"and the bag across her shoulder/ made her look a little like a military man\" were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison playing comb and paper. Mal Evans was sent to Abbey Road's lavatories to get toilet paper (which was stamped with the words, \"PROPERTY OF EMI\"). This was used to cover hair combs, which they blew through to sound like a kazoo orchestra.\nPink Floyd watched the Beatles recording \"Lovely Rita\". It is rumored that \"Lovely Rita\" influenced the song \"Pow R.

Like other department capitals, it is home of the Valle del Cauca Governance, Departmental assembly, The Court of Justice, and other official institutions.\nSantiago de Cali was founded in 1536 and although is one of the oldest cities in America, only until the 1930s accelerated its development to become one of the major economic and industrial centers of the country and the main urban center, cultural, economic, industrial and agriculture of southwestern of Colombia.\nPlace names.\nThe city has a compound name in the fashion of almost all Spanish settlements in America. Santiago (one of the most popular names on the continent thanks to the devotion of Santiago de Compostela in Spain), lives up to the Apostle Santiago. Cali was founded 25 July, the day which marks the date of the Apostle Santiago, principal patron of Europe. So given this name to the city. Cali, derived from the word of the P\u00e1ez language, \"Caly\" (Knitting). Like many others placements of the department. Ej: \"Buga\" (Large clay pot), \"Yumbo\" (Flood, river bank, large river.), \"Sonso\" (Frog), \"Dagua\" (A type of tree), \"Petecu\u00e9\" (Macaw), \"Tulua\" (Orchad), \"Chipichape\" (Cooked corn kernels), \"Yotoco\" (fans the flame), \"Quilichao\" (Flame sheds), \"Changos\" (Chisel).\nHistory.\nSantiago de Cali is one of the oldest cities in Colombia, and the Americas. Its foundation dates back to 1536 by the conquistador Sebastian de Belalcazar (one of the indigenous genocide of the time), to just three years after the foundation of Cartagena de Indias (1533), two years before the foundation of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 (1538) and 26 years of the founding of the first Hispanic population on the continent: Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua del Dari\u00e9n (1510), missing.\nGeography and Resources.\nGeography.\nThe city is located at coordinates ((coord | 3 | 27 | 00 | N | 76 | 32 | 00 | W)), in the department of Valle del Cauca. Geographically Cali is in the valley of the Cauca River, the second largest in the country. At the height of Cali this valley is 35\u00a0km wide and the urban area is on the west side of river. The western part of the city is guarded by the famous Farallones de Cali, which are part of the Cordillera Occidental of the Colombian Andes.\nThe municipality of Cali bordered to the north with Yumbo and La Cumbre, in the northeast by Palmira and east to Candelaria. To the south is the municipality of Jamund\u00ed, rural areas of Buenaventura in the southwest, and Dagua to the northwest.\nThe city is flat with an average elevation of 1,000 m. Cali is situated besides a focal and strategic point: to the west (approximately 100 km) is connected with the port of Buenaventura on the Pacific coast, and northeastern industrial center that conforms to Yumbo the Metropolitan Area of Cali. The city is a step in addition to the Pan-American Highway and therefore a must from Colombia to the Ecuador.\nThe main river of the city and the department is the Cauca River, the part of the municipality comes from the mouth of the river Jamund\u00ed to the border between Cali and Yumbo. The Cauca is a sinuous on his way through the department of Valle, 40 miles sailed in the municipality, advanced only 26\u00a0km south-north after multiple meanders.\nClime.\nThe climate is tropical savanna. The Western Cordillera blocks of moist air fronts from the Pacific Ocean although it is notable that the sea breeze comes to town. The Western Cordillera has 2,000 m average altitude in the north of the city and reached the 4,000 m in the south, this makes in the city the southwestern region that is more rainy than Northwest. The average annual precipitation ranges from 900 mm in the drier areas to 1,800\u00a0mm in wetter areas, with 1,000\u00a0mm average over most of the metropolitan area of Cali. The average temperature is 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) with a minimum average of 19\u00a0\u00b0C (66\u00a0\u00b0F) and a maximum average of 34\u00a0\u00b0C (93\u00a0\u00b0F). Dry seasons are December to March and July to August and the rainy season from April to June.\nNatural Resourses.\nThe location in the Cauca Valley, the climate and terrain, make the city an area of great natural wealth. The confluence of rivers and other water sources make the region a natural output of crops such as sugar cane and animal breeding.\nAs for minerals, although Valle del Cauca is not a metal region, in the city of Cali there are several coal mines in formations called Guachinte and Ferreira, in the south and north of the urban area. In the northern part of the urban area, extending to Yumbo is open pit mining for construction materials.\nEducation.\nUniversities.\nCali have a great number's of Universities and Knowledge Centers, that make the city one of the principal centers of education in the country.\nUniversidad del Valle.\nThe principal university in cali, is the Universidad del Valle (Univalle), University of Valley, Public institution founded in 1945, serves a demand of 29 000 students in undergraduate and graduate (8000 in the regional headquarters), at the headquarters of Cali, 20 800 are undergraduates and 2380 graduate and doctoral programs. It is the leading research and academic center of southwestern Colombia. It has the largest library in the region with 628 569 copies (307 514 books). is among the best national universities and South America.\nOther universities.\nOther universities in the city:\nIcesi University, Pontifical Javeriana University, Autonomy University of Western, Saint Buenaventura University, Santiago de Cali University, and many others technical and technological institutes."}

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album.\nLyrical inspiration.\nInspiration for the song came to Lennon from a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The jingle went: \"Good morning, good morning, The best to you each morning, Sunshine Breakfast, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Crisp and full of fun\".\nThe line \"It's time for tea and Meet the Wife\" refers to a BBC sitcom, \"Meet the Wife\".\nRecording.\nThe track was recorded on 8 February 1967, with overdubs (extra music that's recorded into the song) on 16 February (bass and vocals), 13 March (brass section), 28 March (backing vocals and guitar solo), and 29 March (animal noises). The guitar solo was played by Paul McCartney.\nAt Lennon's request, George Martin brought in Sounds Incorporated to play the brass section with their signature saxophone sound.\nLennon asked engineer Geoff Emerick to arrange the animal noises heard at beginning as well as the end of the song so that the animal heard was one capable of devouring or frightening the animal that came before it..\nThe final sound effect of a chicken clucking was so placed that it transforms into the guitar on the following track, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\".\nIn the mono version, the length is 2:35, whereas in the stereo version, the length is 2:41 because there are more animal noises."}
{"id": "257757", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257757", "title": "A Day in the Life", "text": "\"A Day in the Life\" is a song by the English rock group The Beatles. It is the last song on the group's 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". It is a very famous song.\nInspiration.\nMany people think that the first verse was written about the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune and close friend of Lennon and McCartney, who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 when a Volkswagen pulled out of a side street into his path in Redcliffe Gardens, Earls Court. In many interviews, Lennon said this was the verse's main inspiration. However, George Martin thinks that it is a drug reference (as is the line \"I'd love to turn you on\" and other passages from the song) and while writing the lyrics Lennon and McCartney were imagining a stoned politician who had stopped at a set of traffic lights.\nThe description of the accident in \"A Day in the Life\" was not a literal description of Browne's fatal accident. Lennon said, \"I didn't copy the accident. Tara didn't blow his mind out, but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song\u00a0\u2014 not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene\u00a0\u2014 were similarly part of the fiction.\"\nThe final verse was inspired by an article in the \"Daily Mail\" in January 1967 regarding a substantial number of potholes in Blackburn, a town in Lancashire. However, he had a problem with the words of the final verse, not being able to think of how to connect \"Now they know how many holes it takes to\" and \"the Albert Hall\". His friend Terry Doran suggested that they would \"fill\" the Albert Hall.\nSong structure.\n\"A Day in the Life\" is in the key of G major, but, as Alan W. Pollack explains, \"its true center of gravity is in the parallel minor and Major keys of E.\" The verses are in G-major/E-minor and the bridge is in E-major. A 4/4 meter is used throughout.\nThe song is laid out with an instrumental beginning, followed by three verses (0:13), an orchestral crescendo (1:45), a middle section (2:16), an orchestral bridge (2:49), the final verse (3:19), a second orchestral climax (3:50), and a final piano chord (4:21\u20135:05).\nEach verse sung by Lennon follows the same basic layout, but each has a different way of ending. The first verse, which is twenty measures, ends with a repetition of the F major chord progression before returning to the home key. The second verse, two measures shorter than the first, ends on the C major chord rather than repeating the F major progression. The third verse is the same as the second, except that there is one more measure (to accommodate the \"I'd love to\"), and the verse does not return to the home key. Instead it leads to a bridge, a long climax starting from low E to an E several octaves higher. Random cymbal crashes are interspersed near the end to \"challenge your sense of meter\".\nAn alarm clock rings, beginning McCartney's verse. While the pulse of this section remains the same, the accents suggest a tempo twice as fast as that of the verses before. The three chords in this nineteen measures long section are the I, flat VII, and V chords (E, D, and B). This is followed by an orchestral bridge: a repeated circle of fifths (from C to E) over twenty measures. The bridge is accompanied by a wordless vocal (\"Ahhhh...\") and leads to the fourth and final verse.\nThe final verse has the same layout as the third verse. Starr's drumming, however, retains its double-time feel from McCartney's section. This verse leads to the second crescendo. However, after the orchestra hits its highest note, there is a measure of silence, which leads to the final E-major piano chord.\nThe final chord.\nFollowing the final orchestral climax, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history. Lennon, McCartney, Starr, and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on the Harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.\nThe piano chord was a replacement for a failed vocal experiment: on the evening following the orchestra recording session, the four Beatles had recorded an ending of their voices humming the chord, but after multiple overdubs they wanted something with more impact.\nMcCartney provided the fourth verse of the song, a short piano piece he had been working on by himself, with lyrics about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to drift off into a dream. He had written the piece as a wistful recollection of his younger years, which included riding the bus to school, smoking, and going to class. The line \"I'd love to turn you on\", which concludes both verse sections, was, according to Lennon, also contributed by McCartney; Lennon said \"I had the bulk of the song and the words, but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he couldn't use for anything.\""}

They are usually between \u22122 and +3.\nOxidation states were invented by Antoine Lavoisier to predict how oxygen reacted in chemical reactions; hence the name. Later on, we learned that Lavoisier's theory can be used to predict other reactions too, many of them have nothing to do with oxygen.\nIn ionic compounds, oxidation states tell us about the movement of charge within the compound. For example, chlorine has a very high electronegativity which means that it really likes electrons and sodium has a very low electronegativity which means that it really hates electrons. When sodium and chlorine are close together, sodium will give away an electron to chlorine. A change in charge has taken place; chlorine's charge has gone down which we call reduction, and sodium's charge has gone up which we call oxidation."}

It is done by immersing the object and a bar of the metal in a solution containing the metal ions. Electric current is then applied; the positive goes to the metal and the negative goes to the object. The metal bar dissolves in the solution and plates out on the object, forming a thin but durable coating of metal. It is often used to gold-plate objects for decoration or to stop corrosion. Normally the metal becomes fragile, and is only used for display."}

{"id": "257978", "revid": "7506271", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257978", "title": "JPEG", "text": "In computing, the JPEG file format is a file format which is used to compress digital images. The amount of compression can be changed depending on the wanted quality. If an image is high quality, it will take up a large amount of storage. If it is low quality, it will take up a small amount of storage. The JPEG file format is commonly found on the World Wide Web. The word \"JPEG\" is short for the Joint Photographic Experts Group which created the format. JPEG file extensions include codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and others.\nHow it works.\nYPbPr.\nThe first notable thing about JPEG compression is the way in which the colour of each pixel is stored. Each pixel of the image is assigned 3 bytes to define its colour. All three bytes can have any value from 0 to 255 and every possible combination of the three bytes stands for another colour. In most file formats, the RGB format is used for defining the colour. RGB stands for Red Green Blue. It's named this way because the first of the three bytes tells you how much red there is in the pixel's colour. The second byte tells you how much green there is in the colour and the third byte how much blue. The higher value the first byte has, the more red the pixel looks.\nJPEG also uses three bytes for every pixel each, but it's using the YPbPr (also known as YCbCr) format. Here, the first byte tells us how bright the pixel is. The second byte tells us how blue the pixel is. The third byte tells us how red the pixel is. Using this colour format, the brightness is stored apart from the colour. This is useful, because we are going to compress an image. Because the human eye is better at seeing brightness than seeing colour, we can apply a greater compression to the colour bytes (the Pb-byte and the Pr-byte). Since we see brightness better, we use less compression on the Y-byte, to have the image look better after compression.\nBecause images are most often stored in RGB format, the first step of JPEG compression is usually to correctly change the RGB format into the YPbPr format.\nDiscrete Cosine Transform.\nJPEG uses cosine functions to represent an image. Therefore, we are going to talk a little bit about cosine functions. This is what a cosine function could look like: \nTo have the cosine function represent the colour of a pixel, we say that the higher the value of the cosine function, the brighter the pixel. If we had a set of pixels that went bright-dark-bright, we could use the function above to define them. \nThe function could also have a higher frequency. Like this:\nBut here's where it gets interesting. We can also create different functions by taking the average of different cosine functions. Here is what it would look like if we took the average of the above two functions:\nIn JPEG, DCT is applied to blocks of 8 \u00d7 8 pixels.\nQuantisation.\nSo far, no information has been lost in the process of compressing the image. In this step, we're filtering out information. For that reason, this is the step that lowers the quality of the image. For every block of 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 pixels, the cosine functions with high frequencies are set to 0. This means that these can no longer have any impact on how the image looks when you decompress it. \nA lot of values will now be 0, which means that this can be very easily compressed. This is done using Huffman coding. Huffman coding is the last step of JPEG compression. It is also the only step in which the data is actually compressed.\nStructure.\nBeing a computer file, a JPEG file is made of multiple bytes. One byte in hexadecimal could look like 0x01. The very first bytes of a JPEG are 0xFF, 0xD8 (\"FF D8\"); these bytes are named Start Of Image (SOI). The first section of bytes in a JPEG is the header; this is from FF D8 to right before the last 0xFF, 0xDA (\"FF DA\") bytes. The header contains data about the data and other helpful data. The next section of bytes in a JPEG is the image data; this is from FF DA to 0xFF, 0xD9 (\"FF D9\"). The FF DA bytes are named Start Of Scan (SOS), and the FF D9 bytes are named End Of Image (EOI)."}

When injected into a vein it is much more toxic.\nUse in lethal injection.\nIn the United States, people sentenced to death by lethal injection have usually been executed using three different medications. Potassium chloride is the third medication. It is given after a sedative (to put the prisoner to sleep) and a medicine that paralyzes the prisoner. Potassium chloride works by speeding up the heart until it stops.\nThe use of potassium chloride in lethal injections is controversial. For example, one scientist who studied the three-drug combination called potassium chloride \"extremely painful.\" United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer used her research to argue that lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment. Other doctors agree that if the drugs are not given correctly, a prisoner could experience \"a great deal of pain\" or \"excruciating [terribly painful] suffering.\"\nHowever, other doctors say that lethal injection is less painful than other ways of executing people, like using an electric chair or a gas chamber. They also say that if the three drugs are given correctly, lethal injection should be pain-free. Because doctors are supposed to \"do no harm\", many executions are now done by people who are not doctors. Supporters of lethal injection say that mistakes, not the drugs themselves, are what cause pain."}

It is a reducing agent. \nPreparation.\nIt can be formed by electrolysis of water with a piece of iron metal as the anode (positive connector). A green slime will appear around it, and hydrogen will be released at the cathode (negative connector). It is normally made by reacting iron(II) sulfate with sodium hydroxide.\nUses.\nIt was being investigated as a detoxifier in wetlands. Some wetlands have toxic selenite and selenate ions in them. Iron(II) hydroxide reduces them to selenium, which is much less toxic. It is also used in the nickel-iron battery."}

It was the only song that reached the top 10 in America on the Hot 100 for Oasis. It also reached number 1 in four countries and reached the top 10 in 10 countries.\nBackground.\nNoel Gallagher says the song was written about a girl he met at a concert when he was touring with Oasis.\nIt is said that \"Wonderwall\" was written for Gallagher's then-girlfriend, Meg Mathews. Gallagher now says the song was not about her, but he did say \"The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it. How do you tell your Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself.\"\nIn 2008 Liam Gallagher said this about the song: \"I can't fucking stand that fucking song! Every time I have to sing it I want to gag. Problem is, it was a big, big tune for us.\" Noel said that Liam, \"...thought we had gone too dance when I wrote 'Wonderwall' because the drums didn't go boom-boom bap, boom-boom bap.\" \nRecording.\nThe song was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales in May of 1995. According to producer Owen Morris, the song was done in 6 to 8 hours.\nIn the beginning, Noel wanted to sing this song, but he gave his brother Liam Gallagher the choice, and Noel ended up singing \"Don't Look Back in Anger\". He later said he had only ever wanted to sing \"Don't Look Back in Anger\", and had used \"Wonderwall\" as a bargaining tool.\nMusic video.\nThe music video to the song was filmed in the short period when bassist Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan quit the band due to nervous exhaustion; Scott McLeod came in to replace him.\nThe song won Best British Video at the 1996 BRIT Awards."}

It can be powered by different types of fuels, including gasoline, diesel, natural gas and alcohol.\nApplications.\nGenerally, V8s are only available on more powerful cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The traditional 90\u00b0 large V8 engine is generally too wide and too long to fit easily in vehicles with a front-wheel drive layout, so its application is mostly limited to rear-wheel drive cars and trucks. \nV8s are common in purpose-designed engines for racing cars. They are a common engine configuration in the highest levels of auto racing. The V8 engine is used in the United States where it is required in IRL and NASCAR. V8s engines are also used in Australian auto racing, most notably in the V8 Supercars. Formula One began the 2006 season using V8 engines, which replaced the V10. Formula One made this change to reduce costs and lower power. However Formula One replaced V8 with V6 Turbo in 2014\nV8 engines are also used in large truck and industrial equipment. V8s were an early choice for airplane engines. Modern aircraft seldom used V8s because the heavy weight reduces performance."}

It is the largest unspoilt wilderness in eastern Australia and one of the last remaining wilderness areas on Earth. The area is mostly flat and about half is used for grazing cattle. Much of the wildlife is threatened by introduced species and weeds. However, the eucalyptus wooded savannah, tropical rainforests, and other types of habitat are now recognized as being globally important.\nGeography and geology.\nThe Cape York Peninsula region covers an area of about 137,000\u00a0km\u00b2 north of 16\u00b0S latitude. From the tip of the peninsula, Cape York, it is about to New Guinea across the island and coral reefs of Torres Strait.\nThe west coast is bordered by the Gulf of Carpentaria and the east coast by the Coral Sea. There is no clear border to the south, but the boundary in the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act 2007 of Queensland follows the 16\u00b0S latitude.\nAt the peninsula\u2019s widest point, it is 430\u00a0km from the Bloomfield River, on the east coast, to the Aboriginal community of Kowanyama on the west coast. It is some 660\u00a0km from the southern border, to the tip of Cape York. The largest islands in the Torres Strait include Prince of Wales Island, Horn Island, Moa, and Badu Island.\nCape York is the northernmost point on the Australian continent. It was named by Lieutenant James Cook on 21 August, 1770, after Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany. The Duke was a brother of King George III of the United Kingdom, and died from illness in 1767 when he was only 20 years old:\nThe tropical landscapes are among the most stable in the world. There has been no tectonic activity for millions of years. The peninsula is an extremely eroded, almost level, low plain with mighty meandering rivers and vast floodplains. There are some very low hills, about 800m above sea level in the McIlwraith Range on the eastern side around Coen.\nPart of Australia\u2019s Great Dividing Range, the Peninsula Ridge, is like a backbone along the peninsula. This mountain range is made up of ancient (1,500 million year-old) Precambrian and Palaeozoic rocks. To the east and west of the Peninsula Ridge lie the Carpentaria and Laura Basins, themselves made up of ancient Mesozoic sediments. There are several important landforms on the peninsula: the large area of undisturbed sand dunes on the east coast around Shelburne Bay and Cape Bedford-Cape Flattery; the huge piles of black granite boulders at Black Mountain National Park and Cape Melville; and the limestone karsts around Palmerston in the south.\nThe soils are poor, even compared to other areas of Australia. They are ancient and weathered, not suitable for ploughing and do not respond to fertilizers. Because of the poor soil, the region is thinly settled. Attempts to grow commercial crops have usually failed.\nThe climate on Cape York Peninsula is tropical and monsoonal. The heavy monsoon season is from November to April, during which time the forest becomes almost inhabitable. The dry season is from May to October. The temperature is warm to hot, with a cooler climate in higher areas. The mean annual temperatures range from 18 \u00b0C at higher elevations to 27 \u00b0C on the lowlands in the drier southwest. Temperatures over 40 \u00b0C and below 5 \u00b0C are rare.\nAnnual rainfall is high, ranging from over 2000\u00a0mm. in the Iron Range and north of Weipa to about 700\u00a0mm. at the southern border. Most of this rain falls between November and April. Only on the eastern slopes of the Iron Range is the median rainfall between June and September above 5mm (0.2\u00a0inches). Between January and March, however, the median monthly rainfall ranges from about 170mm (6.5\u00a0inches) in the south to over 500mm (20\u00a0inches) in the north and on the Iron Range.\nRivers.\nThe Peninsula Ridge forms the drainage divide between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Coral Sea. To the west, large, winding river systems including the Mitchell, Coleman, Holroyd, Archer, Watson, Wenlock, Ducie and Jardine flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria. During the Dry season, those rivers become a series of waterholes and sandy beds. Yet, with the heavy rains in the Wet season, they become mighty waterways, spreading across huge floodplains and coastal wetlands and giving life to many freshwater and wetland species.\nOn the Eastern slopes, the shorter, faster-flowing Jacky Jacky Creek, Olive, Pascoe, Lockhart, Stewart, Jeannie and Endeavour Rivers flow towards the Coral Sea. These provide important freshwater and nutrients to the healthiest section of the Great Barrier Reef. Along their banks, those wild, undisturbed rivers are lined with dense rainforests, sand dunes or mangroves.\nThe floodplains of the Laura Basin are now protected in the Lakefield and Jack River National Parks. The plains are crossed by the Morehead, Hann, North Kennedy, Laura, Jack and Normanby Rivers.\nThe Peninsula\u2019s rivers are famous for their hydrological integrity. This means that they are still in their natural state, with water flows and vegetation unchanged. Cape York Peninsula is one of the few places where tropical water cycles remain unchanged. Cape York Peninsula has as much as a quarter of Australia's surface runoff. With less than 3% of Australia's land area it produces more run-off than all of Australia south of the Tropic of Capricorn. The peninsula\u2019s rivers are also important as they put water back into central Australia\u2019s Great Artesian Basin. The Queensland Government is planning to protect 13 of Cape York Peninsula\u2019s wild rivers under the Wild Rivers Act 2005.\nGeological history.\nAround 40 million years ago, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. As it crashed into the Pacific Plate on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central New Guinea were made around 5 million years ago. Protected from this collision zone, the ancient rocks of what is now Cape York Peninsula were did not move.\nDuring the Pleistocene epoch Australia and New Guinea have been land-linked and separated by water a number of times. During the ice ages with their low sea levels, Cape York Peninsula was a low-lying land bridge. Another link existed between Arnhem Land and New Guinea, at times making a big freshwater lake, Lake Carpentaria, in the centre of what is now the Gulf of Carpentaria. In this way, Australia and New Guinea were joined until the shallow Torres Strait was last flooded around 8,000 years ago.\nEcology.\nPlants.\nCape York Peninsula has a range of intact tropical rainforests, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands, tropical savannahs, heath lands, wetlands, wild rivers and mangrove swamps. These are home to about 3300 species of flowering plants. Almost all of the Cape York Peninsula (99.6%) still has its native vegetation. Cape York Peninsula also contains one of the highest rates of endemism in Australia, with more than 260 endemic plant species found so far. Because of this, parts of the Peninsula have been noted for their very high wilderness quality. The plants of the peninsula includes original Gondwanan species, plants that have developed since the breakup of Gondwana and species from Indo-Malaya and from across the Torres Strait in New Guinea. Most variety is in the rainforest areas. Most of the Cape York Peninsula is drier than New Guinea which stops the rainforest plants of that island from moving across to Australia.\nMost of the Cape York Peninsula is covered in grass and woodlands. These have a tall, thick grass layer and scattered trees, mostly eucalypts. The most common tree is the Darwin stringybark. Although common and complete on the peninsula, tropical savannahs are now rare and in poor condition in other parts of the world.\nTropical rainforests cover an area of 748,000 ha, or 5.6 percent of the total land area of Cape York Peninsula. Rainforests need some rainfall during the long Dry season. These conditions are mostly on the eastern slopes of the Cape\u2019s coastal ranges. These are old-growth forests and support a huge range of plants. These rainforests are of high conservation significance. The largest rainforest area on the Cape is in the McIllwraith Range-Iron Range area. The Gondwanan plants of this area includes Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae conifers and Arthrochilus, Corybas, and Calochilus orchids. This rainforest has at least 1000 different plants, including 100 rare or threatened species, and 16% of Australia's orchid species.\nOn poor, dry soils there are tropical heathlands. Northeast Cape York Peninsula has Australia\u2019s largest areas of this highly diverse ecosystem.\nThe big wetlands on Cape York Peninsula are \u201camong the largest, richest and most diverse in Australia\u201d. 19 wetlands of national significance have been identified, mostly on the large floodplains and in coastal areas. Important wetlands include the Jardine River National Park, Lakefield National Park and the estuaries of the great rivers of the western plains. Many of these wetland only happen during the Wet season and have rare or uncommon plant types.\nThe Peninsula\u2019s coastal areas and river estuaries are lined with mangrove forests of kwila and other trees. Australia\u2019s largest mangrove forest is at Newcastle Bay.\nAnimals.\nThe Cape has lots of animals, with more than 700 vertebrate land animal species . Of these, 40 live only here. Because of its geological history, the plants and animals \"of Cape York Peninsula are a complex mixture of Gondwanan relics, Australian isolationists and Asian or New Guinean invaders\u201d (p.\u00a041). Birds include Buff-breasted Buttonquail (Turnix olivii), Golden-shouldered Parrot \"(Psephotus chrysopterygius)\", Lovely Fairywren \"(Malurus amabilis)\", White-streaked Honeyeater \"(Trichodere cockerelli)\", and Yellow-spotted Honeyeater \"(Meliphaga notata)\". Some, such as Pied Oystercatcher, live in other parts of Australia but have important populations on the peninsula. The Cape is also home to the Eastern brown snake, one of the world's most venomous snakes. Mammals include the endangered rodent Bramble Cay Melomys, which lives only on Bramble Cay in the Torres Strait.\nThe rainforests of the Iron Range have species that also live in New Guinea, including the Eclectus Parrot and Southern Common Cuscus. Other rainforest animals includes 200 species of butterfly including 11 endemic butterflies one of which is the huge Green Birdwing, the Green Tree Python and the Northern Quoll. Number of this forest marsupial have dropped because they have tried to eat the introduced poisonous cane toads.\nThe riverbanks of the lowlands are home to specific wildlife of their own. The rivers including the Jardine, Jackson, Olive, Holroyd and the Wenlock are rich in fish. The wetlands and coastal mangroves are noted for their importance as a fish nursery and crocodile habitat, providing important drought refuge. The Great Barrier Reef is off the east coast and is an important marine habitat.\nThreats and preservation.\nCattle farms use about 57% of the total area, mostly in central and eastern Cape York Peninsula. About 20% is indigenous land, with the entire West coast being held under Native title. The remainder is mostly National Park and managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. Land uses include broad acre pastoralism, bauxite and silica sand mining, nature reserves, tourism and fishing. There are big deposits of bauxite along the west or Gulf of Carpentaria coast. Weipa is the centre for mining. Much has been damaged by overgrazing, mining, fires, wild pigs, cane toads, weeds, and other introduced species. But Cape York Peninsula remains fairly unspoilt with intact and healthy river systems and no recorded plant or animal extinction since European settlement.\nThe \"Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy\" study, by the Australian government in 1990, created plans to protect the wilderness. A nomination for World Natural Heritage is currently being looked at by the Queensland and Australian Federal governments. Major national parks include the Jardine River National Park in the far north, Mungkan Kandju National Park near Aurukun, and Lakefield National Park in the southeast of the bioregion.\nPeople and culture.\nThe first known contact between Europeans and Aborigines took place on the west coast of the peninsula in 1606. It was not settled by Europeans until the 19th century when fishing communities, then cattle ranches and later mining towns were started. European settlement led to the displacement of Aboriginal communities and the arrival of Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland. Today the peninsula has about 18,000 people. About 60% of them are Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.\nThe administrative and commercial centre for much of Cape York Peninsula is Cooktown, in its far southeastern corner. The peninsula\u2019s largest settlement is the mining town Weipa on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Most of the Peninsula has few people, with half the people living in very small settlements and cattle ranches. Along the Peninsula Developmental Road, there are small service centres at Lakeland, Laura and Coen. At the tip of Cape York, there is a sizeable service centre on nearby Thursday Island. Aboriginal communities are at Hopevale, Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama, Aurukun, Lockhart River, Napranum, Mapoon, Injinoo, New Mapoon and Umagico. Torres Strait Islander communities on the mainland are at Bamaga and Seisia. A completely sealed inland road links Cairns and the Atherton Tableland to Lakeland Downs and Cooktown. The road north of Lakeland Downs to the tip of the Peninsula is sometimes cut after heavy rains during the wet season (roughly December to May).\nThe Peninsula is a popular with tourists in the Dry Season for camping, hiking, birdwatching and fishing. Many people make the adventurous, but rewarding, drive to the tip of Cape York, the northernmost point of mainland Australia.\nSome of the world's most extensive and ancient Aboriginal rock painting galleries surround the town of Laura, some of which are available for public viewing. There is also a new Interpretive Centre from which information on the rock art and local culture is available and tours can be arranged.\nReferences.\nFurther references"}

To convert the motion, the crankshaft has one or more offset shafts. The pistons are connected to the crankshaft by these shafts. When the piston moves up and down, it pushes the offset shaft. This in turn rotates the crankshaft.\nThe pistons cause a pulsing affect in the rotation. A crankshaft usually connects to a flywheel. The flywheel smooths out the rotation. Sometimes there is a torsion or vibration damper on the other end of the crankshaft. This helps reduce vibrations of the crankshaft. \nLarge engines usually have several cylinders. This helps to reduce pulsations from individual firing strokes. For some engines it is necessary to provide counterweights. The counterweight is used to offset the piston and improve balance. While counterweights add a lot of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a smoother running engine. This allows higher RPMs to be reached and more power produced."}

He released his debut album in 1986. He is the most successful singer in Thailand, as he sold more than 20 million albums. He is also sometimes called the following names:\nBiography.\nThongchai McIntyre, or \"Bird Thongchai\", is best known for his \"string (Thai pop)\" and \"luk thung music\". He is also known for acting in numerous films, on the television, musicals, and in commercials.\nThongchai McIntyre was born in Bangkok in 1958. His parents were James and Udom McIntyre. He lived in a family of musicians, and so, he enjoyed an upbringing in a musical environment. His father died when Bird was still a child. He started working in a bank as an officer. During that time, he had a chance to meet the famous Thai TV producer, \"Kai Varayuth\", who saw entertainment talent in Bird. Bird played his first TV series with Kai while still working in the bank. This task showed his talent. His most memorable roles were those of \"Captain Kobori\" from \"Koo Kam\", which was a tragic love story between a Japanese soldier (played by Bird) and a local Thai girl during the World War II. In both, he starred in a television series, and he reprised his role in the 1996 film adaptation, \"Sunset at Chaophraya\".\nHe reached the top of his musical career in the early nineties. Some of Bird's best-known songs are \"Duay Rak Lae Pook Pan\", \"Koo Gud\", \"Sabai Sabai\" and \"Kob Jai Jing Jing\". His popular singles released recently include luk thung singles \"Mah Tummai\" (with Jintara Poonlarp), \"Fan Ja\" (with Jintara and Jarin B. (Joey Boy), Nat Myria Benedetti and Katreeya English), \"Lao Su Kan Fang\", and \"Yak Tham Kor Tob\" and \"Mai Kang Ying Pae\" from his album \"Volume One\". Westerners became aware of him in the mid nineties as he became the first Thai artist to receive an International MTV Award, be featured in the most high budget Thai film at the time, \"Sunset at Chaopraya\" (which reached international acclaim in Japan as well as the United States). He was featured on CNN and Variety magazine. An award winning documentary on his life entitled \"Crossing Borders\" directed by Phanjanit Garnploog can be seen at St. John's University in New York which includes rare interviews with the director. In 2010, Bird made his first international tour in Los Angeles and the 50th Anniversary of Lincoln Center in New York. It marks the first time in history a Thai pop artist has made an international tour. His Grammy label mates have previously only performed at local venues. \nIn late 2007, he released another album entitled \"Simply Bird\", which features songs such as Chuay Rap Tee and Mee Tae Kid Tueng.\nDiscography.\nAlbums and Singles\nCompilations"}

Marches are usually 2/4 time (One - two - one - two - left - right - left- right) or 4/4 (the same as two bars (measures)) although other time signatures are possible.\nMarches can be slow marches or quick marches. A slow march may be a funeral march.\nJohn Philip Sousa was a composer whose marches became extremely popular (e.g. \"Colonel Bogey's March\").\nIn classical music many composers wrote marches which are not intended to be marched to, but still give the mood of a march. Some famous examples of funeral marches include the second movement of Beethoven's \"Eroica\" Symphony, the \"Marche fun\u00e8bre\" (Funeral March) in Chopin's \"Piano Sonata in B flat minor\", and the \"Dead March\" in Handel's oratorio \"Saul\".\nGustav Mahler often wrote marches in his symphonies. Marches often occur in operas (e.g.Verdi's \"A\u00efda\"), ballets (e.g. Prokofiev's \"Romeo and Juliet\") or, indeed, any kind of music.\nMusic composed for marching uses instruments that soldiers play in marching bands, such as brass instruments, woodwind instruments including fife, snare drum and bass drum. Composers writing marches in classical music may imitate the sound of military bands by using these instruments.\nMarch music is often composed for special ceremonial occasions such as coronations. Edward Elgar and William Walton both wrote march music for coronations."}

It is written by their former lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. The song was released on August 14, 1995 as the second single from their second album \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\". It reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The songwriting started off as a copy of early Beatles songs, mainly \"She Loves You\" and \"From Me to You\".\n\"Roll with It\" received a lot of attention when Food Records, the label of Britpop rivals Blur, moved the original release date of single \"Country House\" to match \"Roll with its release date\", sparking what came to be known as \"The Battle of Britpop\". The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands. This clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot. In the end, Blur's \"Country House\" single sold 274,000 copies to Oasis' 216,000 copies of \"Roll with It\". The singles charted at number 1 and number 2, respectively.\nThe song is like other Oasis songs, such as \"Supersonic\", because it tells the importance of being yourself.\nThe melody for this song appears in The Lemonheads' song \"Purple Parallelogram\", which was co-written by Gallagher and Evan Dando.\nCharts.\nIt was the 20th biggest selling single of 1995 in the United Kingdom."}

He also claims that Creation Records boss, Alan McGee, upon hearing the song, told Noel it was \"too good\" to be a B-side. Noel reportedly replied, \"Well, I don't write shit songs!\".\n\"The Masterplan\" is sung by Noel, and features all band members except for Liam Gallagher, in addition to an orchestra. The song features a backwards guitar solo after the first chorus. Approximately 30 seconds from the end of the song, Noel can be heard singing the chorus from \"Octopus's Garden\" by The Beatles.\nThe song is included in Oasis' album \"Stop the Clocks\".

Discovering a beam of light streaming through a hole in the wall between them, Collins follows the light and spots Penny modelling for a photo shoot. Intrigued, he begins to make more holes, as days go by and they do more photo sessions. Oscar gradually becomes infatuated with the girl, and feels a part of the couple's lives, even forsaking work to observe them.

Sometimes it is called an inline-eight engine. All eight cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft. It can be powered by different types of fuels, including gasoline and diesel.\nA straight-8 can be designed with balanced engine forces. Crankshaft vibration is present in all engines. The use of a harmonic damper is needed at the end of the crankshaft. Without the damper, the vibrations may lead to engine failure.\nThe straight-8 is a smooth running engine. This made it popular in luxury and racing cars of the past. The length of the engine required a long engine compartment. This makes the basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles. The design has been replaced almost completely by the shorter and sturdier V8 engine. Mercedes and BMW made straight-8 aircraft engines during World War I. The engine for aircraft use provided good aerodynamics.\nPerformance and racing cars.\nThe Duesenberg brothers introduced the first successful straight-8 racing engine in 1920. Their engine placed third, fourth and sixth at the Indianapolis 500. The following year one of their cars won the French Grand Prix. The straight-8 was the engine design of choice from the late 1920s until the mid-1950s. Bugatti, Duesenberg, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz and Miller built successful racing cars with high-performance straight-8 engines in the 1920s and 1930s."}

A round mass is attached to the hub by an elastic material. This becomes a spring-mass-damper system. By selection of the damping material and the size of the mass, the damper can be made to quiet the torsional vibrations. The overall appearance is that of a thick disk."}
{"id": "258390", "revid": "293183", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=258390", "title": "Tyndale Bible", "text": "The Tyndale Bible generally refers to the body of biblical translations by William Tyndale. Tyndale\u2019s Bible is credited with being the first English translation to come directly from Hebrew and Greek texts. The term \"Tyndale's Bible\" is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete Bible. Prior to his execution Tyndale had only finished translating the entire New Testament and roughly half of the Old Testament.\nHistory.\nThe chain of events that led to the creation of Tyndale\u2019s New Testament started in 1522. It was in this year that Tyndale illegally acquired a copy of Martin Luther\u2019s German New Testament. Tyndale was inspired by Luther\u2019s work and immediately set out to imitate Luther\u2019s work but in English. He made his purpose known to the Bishop of London at the time Cuthbert Tunstall. However Tunstall rejected Tyndale\u2019s offer of creating an up-to-date modern English Bible. After this rejection Tyndale moved to the continent and ended up in Hamburg where he completed his New Testament in 1524. \nThe first recorded complete edition of his New Testament was published in 1526. Two revised versions were latter published in 1534 and 1536, both personally revised by Tyndale himself. After his death in 1536 Tyndale\u2019s works have been revised and reprinted numerous times.\nReaction of the Catholic Church.\nTyndale\u2019s translations were condemned by both church and state in England, where it must be said it took longer for the reform movement to take hold. Tyndale was forced to flee England for the continent where he found safe haven in pro-reform areas. The church and state reacted strongly against Tyndale\u2019s work, banning his New Testament of 1526 from England. In addition any copy of his work found in England was to be burned. \nLegacy.\nThe legacy of Tyndale\u2019s Bible cannot be overstated. His translations laid the foundations for many of the English Bibles which followed his. His work made up a significant portion of the Matthew Bible which was the first authorized version of the English Bible.

The music was composed by Charles Gounod. The French libretto was written by Jules Barbier and Michel Carr\u00e9. The libretto was based on Carr\u00e9's play \"Faust et Marguerite\". Carre's play was, in turn, based on the first past of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's \"Faust\". The opera was first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique in Paris on 19 March 1859. It was well received. The opera was Gounod's greatest success. \n\"Faust\" was one of the most popular operas of the 19th century. It was the first opera to be performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in October 1883. It is an expensive opera to perform because of its large cast and many sets and costumes. Productions of the opera have declined since 1950. References to the opera have been frequent in other media. It is the opera being performed in the 1925 silent movie \"The Phantom of the Opera\", for example. Despite its cost, the opera is still performed. It is number 35 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide.\nStory.\nThe opera takes place in Germany during the 16th century.\nAct 1.\nDoctor Faust is an aging scholar. He decides that his studies have come to nothing. They have only caused him to miss out on life and love (\"Rien! En vain j'interroge\"). He tries to kill himself with poison. He stops when he hears a choir. He curses science and faith. He asks for guidance from Satan. M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s appears (\"duet: Me voici\"). He tempts Faust with a vision of the beautiful Marguerite at her spinning wheel. He persuades Faust to buy M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s's services on earth in exchange for Faust's in Hell. Faust's cup of poison magically becomes an elixir of youth. He drinks it. The aged doctor becomes a handsome young man. The two companions then set out into the world.\nAct 2.\nNear the city gates, students, soldiers, and villagers sing a drinking song (\"Vin ou Bi\u00e8re\"). Valentin is leaving for war with his friend Wagner. Valentin asks his young friend Si\u00e9bel to take care of his sister Marguerite (\"O Sainte Medaille\"). M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s appears. He provides the crowd with wine. He sings a rousing song about the Golden Calf (\"Le veau d'or\"). M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s says bad things about Marguerite. Valentin tries to strike him with his sword. The sword shatters in the air. Valentin and his friends use the cross-shaped hilts of their swords to drive off what they now know is an infernal power (chorus: \"De l'enfer\"). M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s is joined by Faust. The villagers dance a waltz (\"Ainsi que la brise l\u00e9g\u00e8re\"). Marguerite appears. Faust declares his admiration. She declines to walk with Faust out of modesty.\nAct 3.\nIn Marguerite's garden, the lovesick Si\u00e9bel leaves a bouquet for Marguerite (\"Faites-lui mes aveux\"). Faust sends M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s in search of a gift for Marguerite and sings a cavatina (\"Salut, demeure chaste et pure\") idealizing Marguerite as a pure child of nature. M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s brings in a decorated box containing exquisite jewelry and a hand mirror and leaves it on Marguerite's doorstep, next to Si\u00e9bel's flowers. Marguerite enters, pondering her encounter with Faust at the city gates, and sings a melancholy ballad about the King of Thul\u00e9 (\"Il \u00e9tait un roi de Thul\u00e9\"). \nMarthe, Marguerite's neighbour, notices the jewellery and says it must be from an admirer. Marguerite tries on the jewels and is captivated by how they enhance her beauty, as she sings in the famous aria, the \"Jewel Song\" (\"Ah! je ris de me voir si belle en ce miroir\"). M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s and Faust join the women in the garden and romance them. Marguerite allows Faust to kiss her (\"Laisse-moi, laisse-moi contempler ton visage\"), but then asks him to go away. She sings at her window for his quick return, and Faust, listening, returns to her. Under the watchful eye and malevolent laughter of M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s, it is clear that Faust's seduction of Marguerite will be successful.\nAct 4.\n\"Marguerite's room / A public square outside her house / A cathedral\"\n[Note: The scenes of acts 4 and 5 are sometimes given in a different order and portions are sometimes shortened or cut in performance.] \nAfter being impregnated and abandoned by Faust, Marguerite has given birth and is a social outcast. She sings an aria at her spinning wheel (\"Il ne revient pas\"). Si\u00e9bel stands by her. The scene shifts to the square outside Marguerite's house. Valentin's company returns from the war to a military march (\"Deposons les armes\" and \"Gloire immortelle de nos a\u00efeux\", the well-known \"soldiers' chorus\"). Si\u00e9bel asks Valentin to forgive Marguerite. Valentin rushes to her cottage. While he is inside Faust and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s appear, and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s, thinking that only Marguerite is there, sings a mocking burlesque of a lover's serenade under Marguerite's window (\"Vous qui faites l'endormie\"). Valentin comes out of the cottage, now knowing that Faust has debauched his sister. The three men fight, M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s blocking Valentin's sword, allowing Faust to make the fatal thrust. With his dying breath Valentin blames Marguerite for his death and condemns her to Hell before the assembled townspeople (\"Ecoute-moi bien Marguerite\"). Marguerite goes to the church and tries to pray there but is stopped, first by M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s and then by a choir of devils. She finishes her prayer but faints when she is cursed again by M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s.\nAct 5.\n\"The Harz Mountains on Walpurgis Night / A cavern / The interior of a prison\"\nM\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s and Faust are surrounded by witches (\"Un, deux et trois\"). Faust is transported to a cave of queens and courtesans, and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s promises to provide Faust with the love of the greatest and most beautiful women in history. An orgiastic ballet suggests the revelry that continues throughout the night. As dawn approaches, Faust sees a vision of Marguerite and calls for her. M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s helps Faust enter the prison where Marguerite is being held for killing her child. They sing a love duet (\"Oui, c'est toi que j'aime\"). M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s states that only a mortal hand can deliver Marguerite from her fate, and Faust offers to rescue her from the hangman, but she prefers to trust her fate to God and His angels (\"Anges purs, anges radieux\"). At the end she asks why Faust's hands are covered in blood, pushes him away, and falls down motionless. M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s curses, as a voice on high sings \"Sauv\u00e9e!\" (\"Saved!\"). The bells of Easter sound and a chorus of angels sings \"Christ est ressuscit\u00e9!\" ('\"Christ is risen!\"). The walls of the prison open, and Marguerite's soul rises to heaven. In despair Faust follows it with his eyes; he falls to his knees and prays. M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s is turned away by the shining sword of the archangel."}

Fanny Tacchinardi-Persiani played the title role. The opera is celebrated for the sextet \"Chi mi frena\" and Lucia's lengthy Mad Scene, a technically and dramatically demanding double-aria \"tour de force\". The opera was a great success. Every number received a tremendous ovation. Donizetti and the cast were called forth for numerous curtain calls. The opera is number 19 on the Operabase list of the most performed operas worldwide.\nStory.\nBackground. The story is set in the early 18th century at Lammermoor Castle in Scotland. Two noble families the Ashtons and the Ravenswoods are bitter enemies. They have very nearly exterminated one another with constant warring. Enrico is almost broke. He has arranged a marriage for Lucia with a rich man. He hopes this marriage will relieve his money troubles. He is aware however that Lucia is in love Edgardo.\nAct One. Normanno and others search the castle gardens for an intruder. They believe it is Edgardo on his way to meet Lucia. Enrico has marriage plans for Lucia, and vows to end her affair with his mortal enemy. Lucia waits for Edgardo in another part of the garden. She says she has seen the ghost of a maiden who died for love. Her maid believes this is a bad omen. Edgardo enters. He tells Lucia he must leave for France on family business. He hopes to make his peace with Enrico and marry Lucia. They exchange rings.\nAct Two. Enrico has decided Lucia will marry Arturo at once. He knows she will resist, so he shows her a forged letter. It says that Edgardo has found a new lover. Lucia is crushed. Raimondo urges her to marry Arturo. Arturo arrives, and, with the stunned Lucia, signs the marriage contract. Edgardo suddenly enters and discovers Lucia's signature on the marriage contract. He curses her, and throws his ring on the floor.\nAct Three. The wedding has taken place. Arturo and Lucia have retired to the bridal chamber. Raimondo interrupts the festivities in the Great Hall. He says Lucia is insane and has stabbed her husband to death. Lucia enters carrying a dagger. Her gown is smeared with blood. She acts disoriented. She imagines she is beside Edgardo, and soon to be married to him. She collapses and is carried away. Outside the castle, Edgardo learns that Lucia has died. He stabs himself, hoping to be united in death with Lucia."}

It was written by the band's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. It became the second single to be released from the album \"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\". The song reached number 4 on the UK singles charts. The single was a success, but it failed to achieve a Silver or better certification in the UK. The previous 11 British Oasis singles had reached this level of certification.\nThe album was noted for its psychedelic feel, and \"Who Feels Love?\" was the best example of this. Mark Stent was praised for his production on the song, creating a \"trippy\" feel like that found on Beatles songs such as \"Rain\". With the psychedelic and Eastern sound, the song also reminds of George Harrison achievements like \"Within You Without You\" and also some of his solo work. \nHowever, despite the high-quality production, the song was not well received by the critics, \"NME\" said that the production \"triumphs over any real sort of feeling... pure mock Maharishi spirituality that not even Liam can salvage from the realm of self-parody\".\nOne of the B-sides is a cover of The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\".

It was nicknamed the \"Terror Bird\" for obvious reasons: it was one of the largest carnivorous birds ever to have existed, along with \"Titanis\", \"Kelenken\" and \"Brontornis\". Its rudimentary wings had claws shaped like a meat hook for tackling prey, which was then killed with the massive beak. It ate small mammals and carrion. \nIts skull was up to sixty centimeters long, armed with a powerful, hook-tipped beak. The structure of the beak and the large claws on the toes show that this was a bird of prey. It raced over the grassy plateaus and hills of Patagonia, catching small reptiles and mammals leaving larger prey to its more massive relatives such as \"Brontornis\". "}

The Milankovitch theory says the planet will continue to go into glaciation cycles because of the planet's difference in orbit from a perfect circle, the axis of the planet tilting, and pushing of the Earth's orbit. As part of the supercontinent cycle, plate tectonics may create a supercontinent within 250 million\u2013350 million years. Some time in the next 1.5 billion\u20134.5 billion years, the axis's tilt may begin to change into bad versions, with changes in the axis's tilt of up to 90\u00b0.\nOne billion to two billion years in the future, the increase in solar radiation caused by the helium build-up at the core of the Sun will result in the loss of the oceans and the cessation of continental drift. Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a bad greenhouse effect. By that point, most if not all the life on the Earth will be gone. The most likely fate of the planet is being destroyed by the Sun in about 7.5\u00a0billion years, after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded to cross the planet's orbit.\nHuman influence.\nHumans now play a top role in the biosphere, with the large amount of people in many of Earth's ecosystems. This has caused a widespread, ongoing extinction of other species known as the Holocene extinction. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the large distribution of invasive species, hunting and climate change.\nSolar evolution.\nThe energy generation of the Sun is based upon changing of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star.\nWhen the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, increasing by 1% every 110 million years. In three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be limited in 4.8 billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the increase in luminosity reaches 121% of the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will be into a red giant."}

It inhabited subtropical open woodland in Australia during the late Miocene. It may have been partly carnivorous. It was heavier than the Moa and taller than \"Aepyornis\". \n\"D. stirtoni\" had a long neck and stub-like wings, so it was flightless. Its legs were powerful, but it was not a fast runner. The bird's beak was large and immensely powerful, leading early researchers to believe that it was used to shear through tough plant stalks.

She was perhaps most historically famous and also perhaps best notable for having written up and also having published several classic children's storybooks with which are all about and mostly based loosely on the narrative tales of amongst several of her classic and most beloved animal characters such as \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\".\nPotter was born on July 28, 1866 and was then raised and eventually grew up in Kensington, London during the early childhood stages of her life. She was somehow and pretty well-off and her whole family was also quite rich and even became extremely wealthy overnight at the next and in between the period of time from directly onwards and just shortly at right after when her father Rupert William Potter, who had also great multi-artistic talents and was also an adept amateur photographer, had wisely invested a large part of their family income and hard-earned savings in the stock exchange market during the early 1890's. She was also surrounded as well as highly taught and intellectually educated by many governesses while throughout and during her growing teenage and adolescent years. Although, she did not have as many friends at while all throughout and at during in her entire lifetime period and longtime writing career, but she did rather was surrounded by the beautiful mother nature and on while on the contrary on the other hand, she otherwise had many loving pets, including Benjamin and Peter, 2 favorite pet rabbits, the latter of which would be her basis for her very first and most beloved storybook character. She had also spent most of her happy holidays in Scotland and the Lake District. There, she eventually began to learn to love nature, plants and animals, by which she had also carefully sketched, artistically illustrated and creatively painted and also thus on became interested at painting and favorably loved to paint pictures of them.\nBy around the time when she was around at the age of 30 and from there onwards, Potter had then on written up and also then officially published her first original and classic children's storybook entitled \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\". It was very widely popular and had universal appeal to people of all ages, especially to amongst all young children. She also at one point on in the time of her life became romantically engaged to her then-publisher Norman Warne. Both of her parents unfortunately disapproved of this and thus so became very angry with her as they disputed over the love affair and thereby tumultuosly separated with her because of this as they really did not want her to marry someone who was socially lower than her. However, Warne had unexpectedly died just before he and Potter could even officially marry each other. Eventually, both of Potter's parents had then forgiven her and eventually reconciled with her.\nPotter then went and moved on with her life and also began on with prominently writing up and even creatively illustrating multiple classic children's storybooks along with many illustrative background designs and distinctive character sketches within the pages of her storybooks at over full-time. Fortunately, she did not have to depend on her parents anymore for any help and much support and did not even need to ask her parents for any more money because she already had enough self-earned money of her own from out of writing and publishing a lot of her prominent children's storybooks. In time, she then bought out Hill Top Farm and even purchased some more huge tracks of land. While then on at throughout and during much later in her 40's, she then married William Heelis, a local solicitor. She also began raising sheep and thus became a farmer, though she still continued on with writing her storybooks based on the epic tales of her several classic beloved animal characters. She has perhaps written and published over 23 classic children's storybooks to date during most of all the time of her life.\nPotter eventually married William Heelis in 1913 and their marriage had lasted for about 30 years on until the time of her death in 1943. Although, the couple never had any children while living together on since during the years of their marriage. She had then on since suffered from a congenital heart problem and had died of a cardiovascular heart disease and pneumonia in Near Sawrey, Lancashire at the age of 77 on December 22, 1943. Almost all of her whole life-savings from within and out of her self-earned money from writing up her stories and publishing her books and all of the money by which she had also thus inherited on from the time of the death of her immediate family members including both of her parents and as well as her younger brother Walter Bertham Potter was entirely left behind with to the National Trust. Her popular classic children's storybooks continued to sell out well around the world, in many different languages. Her then-widower, Heelis had also eventually died just nearly between 1-2 years later in sometime on and around August 1945."}

They lived in the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs of the Cainozoic. The first remains were discovered in the mid-19th century.\nIn the 1870s, the famous American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope discovered another, more complete set of fossils in North America, and named them \"Diatryma\".\nThe fossil remains of these birds have been found in western-central Europe (England, Belgium, France and Germany) as well as North America. Their life style is in dispute.\nDescription.\n\"Gastornis parisiensis\" measured on average 1.75 metres (5.7 ft) tall, but large individuals grew up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall. \"Gastornis\" had a huge beak with a slightly hooked top, which possibly suggests that it was carnivorous. \"Gastornis\" had large powerful legs. It had large feet with small talons. Fossil footprints suggest it was a herbivore.\nPaleobiology.\nDistribution.\nAlthough North American and Europe were separated by the end of the Cretaceous, there must have been a landbrige still in place somewhere. This is because the European and North American \"Diatryma\"s were so similar. Other bird and mammal genera also occur on both sides of the (present-day) North Atlantic in the Palaeocene and Eocene. This is evidence that Europe and North America were once connected by dry land in part of the early Cainozoic.\nPalaeoecology.\nAt its time, the environment where \"Gastornis\" lived had dense forest and a moist to dry subtropical or even tropical climate. North America and Europe were still rather close, and Greenland probably was covered with lush woodland and grassland. Only narrow straits of a few 100\u00a0km at most would have blocked landbound dispersal of the \"Gastornis\" ancestors. Land in North American was connected. Their European range was an archipelago, with the Alpsbuilding up, and high sea levels in the Paleocene and Eocene. Geographically, it was roughly similar to today's Indonesia.\n\"Gastornis\" has been depicted as predatory. However, some doubt the bird was agile enough to catch fast-moving prey, and have doubts about the beak being right for carnivory. It may be that \"Gastornis\" was an ambush hunter, or used pack hunting techniques to pursue or ambush prey. If \"Gastornis\" was a predator, it would have needed some means of hunting prey through the dense forest.\nAlternatively, they may have been mainly scavengers, omnivores or even herbivores. The large beak of \"Gastornis\" would have been suited for crushing seeds and tearing off vegetation. But it seems too strong for a purely vegetarian diet. Regardless of what these birds ate, the beak may have been used also for social display \u2013 its presence in all known fossils argues against a sexual display role. These contradicting hypotheses, which can't be separated by the evidence, make the paleobiology of \"Gastornis\" unclear.\nSimilar gigantic birds of the Cenozoic were the South American terror birds (phorusrhacids) and the Australian mihirungs (\"Dromornis\"). The former were certainly carnivorous, and the latter are suspected of being predators, too. On the other hand, ratites, the flightless giant birds of our time, feed on plants, small vertebrates, and invertebrates.\n\"Gastornis\" were among the largest, if not \"the\" largest birds alive during the Paleogene. They had few natural enemies and serious competitors. If these huge birds were active hunters, they must have been important apex predators which dominated the forest ecosystems of North America and Europe until the middle Eocene. \nThe mid-Eocene saw the rise of large creodont and mesonychid predators in Eurasia and North America. The appearance of these new predators coincides with the decline of \"Gastornis\" and its relatives. This was possibly due to an increased tendency of mammalian predators to hunt together in packs (especially in the hyaena-like creodonts). We know of no bird which weighed more than half a metric ton. Perhaps they could not evolve to larger sizes. If so, they could not compete by sheer bulk as mammals are often able to do.\nTrace fossils.\nIn late Paleocene deposits of Spain and early Eocene deposits of France, shell fragments of huge eggs have turned up in Provence. These are presumably from \"Gastornis\". \nSome of these fragments were complete enough to reconstruct a size of 24 by 10\u00a0cm (about 9.5 by 4\u00a0inches) with shells 2.3\u20132.5\u00a0mm (0.09\u20130.1\u00a0in) thick. This is roughly half again as large as an ostrich egg, and very different in shape from the more rounded ratite eggs. "}
