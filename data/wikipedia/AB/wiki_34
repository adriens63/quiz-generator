He was one of the most famous painters of the 20th century. His work was influenced by Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. He was also very interested in the theory of color.\nLife and career.\nKlee was born in M\u00fcnchenbuchsee, a town near Bern in Switzerland. His mother, born Ida Maria Frick, came from Basel in Switzerland. His father, Hans Klee, came from Tann, a small town in the Hesse state of Germany. Both his parents were musicians. When he was very young he trained to be a violinist. Then he decided to become an artist. He studied art under Heinrich Knirr. In 1899 he was admitted to the Academy of Fine arts in Munich. After leaving the academy he also studied art in Italy. After Italy, he returned to Bern and lived with his parents for several years.\nKlee married the pianist Lily Stumpf in 1906. They went to live in Munich. In 1906 he had his first major exhibition. Besides his painting, Klee taught art at the Bauhaus from 1920 to 1931. and later at the Dusseldorf Academy. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, life became very hard for modern artists. Klee moved back to Switzerland in 1933. He died in Muralto, Switzerland in 1940. For many years he had suffered from scleroderma, an autoimmune disease.\nKlee made over 10,000 paintings, drawings, and etchings in his lifetime. His works are held in museums all over the world. In 2005, the Zentrum Paul Klee (Paul Klee Center) was opened in Bern. The building was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. It holds 4000 works by Klee and shows 150 at time. The exhibition changes every six months.\nGallery.\nThese pictures are from Klee's mature career. He painted them while he was teaching at the Bauhaus. During this time he was also a member of a group of artists called Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four). The other three members were Wassily Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky. Like Klee, both Kandinsky and Feininger taught at the Bauhaus. The four artists lectured and exhibited together in Germany and the USA. "}

{"id": "626454", "revid": "731605", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=626454", "title": "Qubit", "text": "A Qubit (or QBit) is a unit of measure used in quantum computing. \nLike a bit in normal (non-quantum) computing, a Qubit has two distinct states, 0 state and the 1 state. However, unlike the normal bit, a qubit can have a state that is somewhere in-between, called a \"superposition.\"\nIf you try measure a qubit that is in a superposition, the qubit will change, and become one of two states. The state the qubit changes to depends on how it is measured. For simplicity, let's assume we are measuring in a way that will make the qubit change to either a 0 state or a 1 state.\nA qubit can be represented as a 2-element column vector.\nA qubit in the 0 state looks like formula_1. \nA qubit in the 1 state looks like formula_2.\nIn general, a qubit state will look like formula_3 , where formula_4.\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 are called amplitudes. They can be complex numbers. Each state has an amplitude.\nBy squaring a state's amplitude, you can get the probability of measuring that state.\nEach state can also have a phase. The phase is part of the amplitude and is what can make the amplitude a complex number.\nA state's phase is like how much that state has rotated. The angle of phase is usually represented as either \u03a6 or \u03c6. Let's use \u03c6.\n\u03c6 can go from 0 to formula_5 radians. The angle sort of goes into an Euler identity, where instead of formula_6, the formula_7 gets substituted with the angle \u03c6. The state's phase becomes formula_8.\nThis expression formula_8is a phase factor that becomes part of a state's amplitude. It gets multiplied with the amplitude.\nA phase angle of 0 makes the amplitudes positive real numbers, since formula_10.\nA phase angle of formula_11 makes the amplitudes negative real numbers, since formula_12. (This is Euler's identity)\nA phase angle of formula_13 makes the amplitudes positive imaginary numbers, since formula_14.\nA phase angle of formula_15 makes the amplitudes negative imaginary numbers, since formula_16.\nBeyond 0 and formula_5, the phase angle just wraps back around again, since it is just a rotation.\nAn example qubit may look like formula_18. There is a 50% chance of measuring a 0 or a 1. There is a phase of 1 on the 0 state's amplitude. There is a phase of -1 on the 1 state's amplitude.\nQubits are generally written as kets, which look like formula_19. Kets are part of Bra-Ket notation, also known as Dirac notation. Kets are a way of saying column vector.\nThe 0 and 1 state are written as formula_20 and formula_21 respectively. \nA general qubit in ket notation will be written as formula_22.\nThis equation is exactly the same as formula_23, since formula_24"}

They killed two civilians and the bomber, as well as injuring another six people.\nThe suspected bomber was Mark Anthony Conditt, age 23, who lived in Pflugerville, Texas, outside Austin. \nBackground.\nThe Austin Police Department (APD) believe the explosions were connected and considered the possibility that they are racially motivated. They have also warned civilians to not open suspicious packages, and to call the police.\nAustin police officially connected the March 2 bombing following the bombings on March 12. None of the packages were mailed, instead they were placed near the individuals' homes. Two of the bombs were triggered upon being picked up, another was triggered upon being opened, and the fourth bombing was suspected to be activated by tripwire.\nOn March 2, 2018, 39-year-old Anthony Stephan House was killed by picking up an apparent package bomb at his home. Then, on March 13, 2018, the bombings killed 17-year-old cellist Draylen Mason. \nAuthorities first offered a reward of $65,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the bomber or bombers.

He first studied art in Russia but he spent most of his career in Germany. He painted in the Expressionist style and was particularly known for his portraits. He also painted landscapes and still lifes.\nLife and career.\nJawlensky was born in Torzhok, a town in the western part of Russia. His father, Georgi von Jawlensky, was a colonel in the Imperial Russian Army. Like his four brothers, Jawlenskywas became an officer in the army. He studied at the military academy in Moscow, but was very interested in art. He studied art privately while he was serving as a soldier. In 1890 he was accepted at the St. Petersburg Academy of Art. He received permission from the army to study art there while still serving as a soldier. He became friends with artists who worked in the studio of Ilya Repin.\nIn 1896, Jawlensky resigned from the army. He went to Munich in Germany to study art and begin his career as a painter. In Munich he lived with Marianne von Werefkin. She was a painter who studied with Repin. He studied with Anton A\u017ebe in Munich. He also became friends with Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky became an important influence on Jawlensky's art. In 1902 Jawlensky's son Andreas was born. His mother was H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Nesnakomoff (1881-1965). She was Marianne von Werefkin's maid in Russia and then lived with her and Jawlensky in Munich. In 1905\u20131906 Jawlensky travelled to Paris for an exhibition of his paintings. In Paris he met Henri Matisse. Matisse became another important influence on Jawlensky's painting style. World War I began in 1914. Jawlensky was expelled from Germany because Russia was one of the countries fighting against Germany. He went to live in Switzerland.\nIn 1922 Jawlensky married H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Nesnakomoff. They returned to Germany and settled in Wiesbaden. For the next 11 years, he concentrated on abstract paintings of heads. He also organized the artistic group \"Die Blaue Vier\" (The Blue Four). The other three members of the group were Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Paul Klee. The four artists lectured and exhibited together in Germany and the USA. From 1929 Jawlensky suffered very badly from arthritis. He had to give up painting in 1937 because he could no longer hold his brushes. He died in Weisbaden in 1941 at the age of 77.\nJawlensky's son Andreas (1902-1984) also became a painter. As a teenager he exhibited with his father. By the end of the 1920s, he became known in his own right. Andreas served in the German army during World War II. He was captured by the Russians and spent 10 years in prisoner of war camp in Siberia. His later paintings, done in Germany and Switzerland, were mostly landscapes. In 1987 there was an exhibition of both Alezej and Andreas's paintings in New York City.\nGallery.\nThe first picture is a portrait of Jawlensky's future wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Nesnakomoff from 1900. It was painted in the more realistic style taught in the art schools of Russia. The later paintings show the influence of expressionism and fauvism on Jawlensky's work after he moved to Germany."}

{"id": "626649", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=626649", "title": "Sustainability in Conwy", "text": "The local authority of Conwy is located in North Wales and borders Gwynedd and Denbighshire. The County includes some of North Wales\u2019s largest settlements such as Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Conwy town. It has holds 4% of Wales\u2019s total population at 111,273 for mid-2006 according to the national assembly for Wales (2006). Industry in this county has changed considerably over the last 2 centuries as during the industrial revolution slate quarrying was a big industry as stated by Day (2002, PP36) \u201cThe most distinctive economic feature of north-west Wales was its unique slate quarrying industry\u201d. However, in recent times there has been a big emphasis on tourism, especially in seaside resorts such as Llandudno. But one big questioned raised by many in recent years is how is sustainability being implemented in Conwy? This article will focus on sustainable approaches in which Conwy as a local authority are implementing over the next couple of years. This report assesses the sustainability of Conwy in regards to environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations in this region but also looking at Conwy\u2019s LDP and corporate plan for 2017-2022.\nEnvironmental Sustainability.\nConwy being located on the North Wales Coast and stretching into the Snowdonia National Park has very impressive and outstanding scenery. Although as mentioned earlier slate quarrying in some of these areas has left scaring on the landscape with \u201centire mountains chiseled away\u201d Day (2002, PP36) in some areas. It is therefore crucial that Conwy is enlisting schemes to help preserve its environment for future generations. In 2016 the Welsh assembly government published the Environment for Wales act (2016). This act applies to all the public bodies in wales and aims to help Welsh local authorities by up to 80% by 2050 - Conwy Council (2017) and this features in both the corporate plan and the LDP for Conwy.\u00a0 \nThey plan to do this by a number of objectives including implementing sustainable coastal and flooding defenses so properties and the coastline at risk are protected by a scheme, which is fit for purpose. Also the CBCC (2017) is aiming to improve recycling facilities and working with the Welsh government to increase recycling and reduce their Carbon footprint by investing in more renewable energies. In regards to renewable energy in this county they are trying to promote the development of a tidal lagoon in Colwyn Bay. This project would not only produce renewable low carbon energy for North Wales but can act as a coastal defense on the Conwy coastline and has potential to be used as a recreational facility. The County are also looking into other renewable energy schemes for the future decades. Leading on from this the CBCC (2017) state in there LDP that they are focusing on improving the landscape of areas that have been scared because of quarrying as mentioned earlier. This is in conjunction with the environment for Wales act (2016) and mentions that they are introducing agricultural grading to their land to ensure it returns its essential nutrients and increasing peat productions. Another scheme which is CBCC are looking to implement is a green wedge scheme. This involves promoting and encouraging the amount of green space available in the county and this is incorporated in both their LDP and corporate plan. \nCultural sustainability.\nCultural sustainability is the adapting beneficial parts of a specific nation\u2019s history and culture to help the development for the future and present generations. Aspects such as language and historical buildings reflect tradition values of past cultures and can therefore be used as a means to measure sustainability. In the 2011 census published by the Conwy County Borough Council, that in Conwy: \nStudies in China show that among those living in China there was strong evidence of residents having a specific connection to building that represent their history and past culture. Even though this is a study that was conducted in China, examples of this can also be seen everywhere in the world including Conwy. This sense of longing for historical styled building is evident in Wales in terms of listed buildings. \nIn Wales (and England) buildings with significant historical interest are often classified into either Grade I or Grade II buildings. Grade I listed buildings are buildings with significant historic relevance whereas Grade II listed buildings are buildings which are important in reflection to past history and culture but with less significance than Grade I buildings. Accorded to the British Listed Building website Conwy has a total of 254 listed buildings (both Grade I and Grade II), which is the second highest in the whole of Wales, second to Llandudno which has 394 and then followed by Abergele which has 81. The listed buildings in Conwy range from Grade I listed buildings such as: \nGrade II buildings such as:\nBuildings can also be used to view the national identity of the area through the eyes of those living there and those visiting as in recent years culture has played an important part of tourism and is increasingly in demand from tourists which is reflected in the Conwy Culture Centre. The development of this cultural centre was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2015 and a planning application was approved in 2017 which allows building and development to start. The Centre was planned to provide a safe space for youths to meet as well as a place to hold and display historic collections as well as offer training programmes and volunteer opportunities to locals who live in the area to improve their quality of live and the job aspects etc they are able to get. These aspects are all insightful of the \u2018Conwy County Borough Council annual report 2016/17\u2019 which explains how they had created a new strategy to increase the number of Welsh speakers (as well as the quality of the language that people who can speak the language were confident that they were able to speak). It also said that they had gained enough funding to be able to begin to develop the centre. As well as this it stated that heritage tourism within Conwy was increasing as a result of the changes that they made and that the volunteering support that was bring provided by the Conwy Culture Centre was worthwhile as two of the volunteers who took part were awarded with well-known awards (BBC Sports Wales young volunteer of the year).\nSocial Sustainability.\nOne of the four main indicators which are usually used to measure successful sustainability is the social aspects available in an area. Often studies into social sustainability include \u201chousing, household structure, paid domestic work, material cultures of home and homelessness\u201d. In attempt to reduce the rate of homelessness in Conwy, Conwy County Borough Council have made a five year strategy in 2013 (Local Housing Strategy). The aims of this strategy included making housing more affordable in attempt to allow the working population, those most likely to be renting homes, to remain in the area as housing is hard to afford. 2,200 homes in Conwy in 2015 were overcrowded as families could not afford large enough houses. Conwy County Borough Council (2015) also reveal that homelessness began to decrease in 2005, however overall, the rate of homeless in Conwy is lower than the national average for Wales. The Conwy Housing Solutions has an online help guide for those who are affected by homelessness and those that are expected to become homeless within 8 weeks and explains how Part 2 of the 2014 Housing (Wales) Act and Conwy County Borough Council (CCBC) can offer help. As well as homelessness in general studies have shown that there is often more homeless females than males and that this pattern is not being investigated enough and also that often, as women have different needs to men, women who are homeless suffer more from the effects of homelessness than men do.\nUnemployment levels in Conwy in 2005 were 4% which was higher than the average for Wales at the time. One possible explanation for this could be due to the fact that in many places women still struggle to get jobs in 'male-dominated' fields such as farming and building therefore they often aren't able to get training or if they already have the necessary training they can find anyone to hire them. To try to change the problem with gender inequality in Conwy, CCBC have formed a \u2018Strategic Equality Plan\u2019 which was put into action in 2016. This plan attempts to contest gender inequalities in employment, pay and training by 2020.\nEconomic Sustainability.\nEconomic sustainability in Conwy is being planned by Conwy County Borough Council through the Conwy economic growth strategy 2017-2027. The creation of renewable energy has a great potential to increase the sustainable development of specific areas by creating a large selection of socioeconomic benefits such as improving regional and rural development opportunities, employment opportunities and the establishment of a domestic industry (del R\u00edo and Burguillo, 2009). There are five ambitions in Conwy\u2019s economic growth strategy 2017-2027, one of them being to facilitate the tidal lagoon as mentioned earlier and other renewable energy projects across the county Conwy Council 2018. The tidal lagoon will create employment opportunities for the people of Conwy improving the sustainability of the local economy. Sourcing from small businesses can also improve the economic sustainability of local economies. Buying from small businesses can add to the development of the local economy in a variety of ways such as providing innovative green products and services (Walker and Preuss, 2008).\nConwy council want the local economy to be confident, resilient and sustainable. Conwy council will encourage new ideas and will work proactively with businesses to promote conditions in which they can grow. This is evidence that Conwy Council are aiming to effectively improve their local economy through the enhancement of local businesses that will in turn increase the economic sustainability of Conwy. Sustainable tourism is important for sustainable economic development. Appropriate policies are being applied within the Principality of Wales through the Wales Tourist Board to ensure successful sustainable tourism development (Owen, Witt and Gammon, 1993). An ambition of the Conwy Economic Growth Strategy 2017-2027 is to create winter tourism offer across the county making Conwy a year-round visitor destination Conwy Council (2018). This is an appropriate policy for Conwy as the area faces problems associated with seasonal tourism. The improvement of winter tourism in Conwy aims to counteract these problems and make the county a year-round tourist destination. Tourism is an important part of Conwy\u2019s local economy and the creation of sustainable year-round tourism will further support the local economy, specifically in winter months. This will then improve the sustainable economic development of the County of Conwy. Higher education provides benefits to individuals and the society and must be considered when evaluating the economic sustainability of an area. Students who attend higher education obtain a wide range of personal and financial benefits (Baum et al, 2010). This would then support individuals in contributing to their local economy and its sustainable development. The Conwy County Borough council have recognised this and aim to establish a dedicated higher education presence in the county as outlined in the Conwy Economic Growth Strategy 2017-2027. This ambition will lay out a future for higher education institutions in the area and Wales as a whole. The increase in students attending higher education institutions shall then see a rise in financial benefits in Conwy County which will in turn promote the development of a sustainable economy in the area.\nSummary.\nIn Summary Conwy has introduced a variety of schemes to help preserve the county for future generations. It is good to see that sustainability features so much in both the council\u2019s Local development plan and corporate plan 2017-2022. It would be interesting to revisit this in the next five year and to see what goals featured in the corporate plan have been met and in particular developments on the proposed Tidal Lagoon in Colwyn Bay. For an area with such a diverse history and culture, it is good to see that both the council and communities want to preserve it for future generations. "}

He painted in the realist style. Less than 30 of his paintings and drawings survive. The National Gallery of Slovenia in Ljubljana holds most of his works. He was most famous for his private painting school which he opened in Munich in 1892. Many foreign students came to study with him including Alexej von Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky.\nLife and career.\nAnton A\u017ebe and his twin brother Alois were born to a peasant family in Dolen\u010dice, a small village in Slovenia. Their father died of tuberculosis when the boys were seven years old. Their mother had a very bad mental illness. She could not look after the farm or take care of the boys. A guardian took care of them. Anton had very poor health. He did not grow like a healthy child. He remained very short all his life. He also had problems with his spine and his legs. His guardian sent him to Klagenfurt as an apprentice to a merchant. After five years A\u017ebe ran away. He went to Ljubljana. In Ljubljana he met the painter Janez Wolf. He helped Wolf paint frescos in churches.\nIn 1880 Wolf helped A\u017ebe get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. A\u017ebe studied for there for two years, but he did not like the academy's teaching method. He thought it was old-fashioned. In 1884 he moved to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. The Munich academy was much more modern. A\u017ebe did very well there. His teachers, Gabriel von Hackl and Ludwig von L\u00f6fftz, admired his work. The academy gave him a scholarship. He and his friend Ferdo Vesel, another art student, earned extra money by selling their drawings and paintings. They also earned money by helping other students with their painting and drawing assignments.\nA\u017ebe finished his studies at the Munich academy in 1891. By that time he was already known for his portrait painting. His paintings were shown in art exhibitions at the Glaspalast. The Glaspalast was a large glass and iron exhibition building in the old botanical garden of Munich. It was modeled after the Crystal Palace in London. In 1892, Ferdo Vesel encouraged A\u017ebe to give private lessons to art students in Munich. He started with seven students who rented a room for their lessons, but the number grew very fast. Soon A\u017ebe was able to rent a building on 16 Georgenstrasse for the school. He also had his own studio on that street. The door to the school had a sign that said \"Nur fest!\" (\"Be bold!\"). The school became very famous. It specialised in painting nudes and portraits. Famous artists who studied at A\u017ebe's school included Alexej von Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky.\nA\u017ebe did all the teaching at the school by himself. This left little time for his own painting. In his later years Kandinsky wrote about his old teacher's generosity and kindness. A\u017ebe often gave free lessons to students who could not afford to pay. A\u017ebe died from cancer in 1905 at the age of 43. His obituary in a Munich newspaper described him as a man of great modesty and one of the city's \"most original and best-known artistic personalities.\""}

The game is centered around being the last person alive. It also consists of a storm slowly moving towards a point on the map. If a player is caught in the storm for too long, their character is eliminated. The game is so popular that one weekend there were 3.6 million people playing it. In the first year of Fortnite, Epic Games made a mode called Save the World which is Fortnite's main campaign. Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world, where around 40 million people log on to play the game monthly. The original version of this game was called \"Save The World\" and was first introduced in 2011 with the name of Fortnite. In this mode, your mission is to save the survivors trapped in the storm zone.\nGameplay.\nIn Fortnite Battle Royale, the game starts with up to 100 players. The player may join with other players to form a team of two to four players, or the player may play on their own. The main goal of the game is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players. The round starts with weaponless players skydiving from floating buses (called \"Battle Buses\") into a region of land. The game is set in that particular environment with all of the weapons, health items and other combat support that is needed for players to survive. Opponents attack other players and defend themselves by building structures. Throughout the game, a purple storm approaching from outside the land will move closer and closer towards the center of the map. Any player caught in the storm will become damaged. This directs surviving players closer to each other, forcing them to have to fight against each other. During the match, supply drops that provide legendary weapons and items will appear in random locations. Similar to \"\", \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" is primarily played in third-person perspective (a type of perspective where the player controls the character as if they were around the character).\nWhat makes \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" unique from other Battle royale games is the new building system, originating from the original Fortnite game. Players may destroy objects in their environment to provide materials so that they can build fortifications (walls, roofs, floors, etc) that help protect them from enemies. Some fortifications can be built quickly, but they will be destroyed easily. Some fortifications, however, can be built slowly but resists attacks better.\nThe game is free-to-play, however players have the option to make in-app purchases that earn extra V-Bucks. \"Vinderbucks\", or V-Bucks for short, allows players to purchase new skins for their characters, weapons, or dances. The player can also earn V-Bucks without in-app purchases through completing missions or challenges that can even include skins.\nEver since Fortnite Battle Royale was first released, Epic Games, the creator of the game, adds new features to it regularly. They frequently add new items and weapons for the game as well as fixing up any glitches or other critical problems in the game that affect gameplay.\nSeasonal changes.\nFortnite Battle Royale has \"seasons\" that last for about 10 weeks each.. These seasons introduce a new theme, along with a new chapter in the game's storyline. Each season also brings new content, including new exclusive skins and new gameplay elements. There are currently 16 seasons, and 2 chapters at the moment.\nOn October 15, 2019, a new chapter was released to Fortnite Battle Royale. This added even more new gameplay like boats, fishing, new guns, a lot of guns and items being vaulted, and a completely new map.\nPopularity.\nThe game quickly gained popularity, with over 10 million players playing the game within the first two weeks of release. As of March of 2019, Fortnite Battle Royale has 250 million players, exceeding the population of Canada.\n\"Fortnite Battle Royale\" has also been popular with children, even though the game is all about shooting each other. The game's cartoonish art style, free-to-play nature (does not cost money to play the game), and being able to interact online makes it attractive to kids. Since the release of the mobile version of \"Fortnite Battle Royale\", many parents and teachers were concerned about how it affects children psychologically. Teachers have noticed that children are easily distracted when playing Fortnite. Epic Games, the creator of \"Fortnite Battle Royale\", responded by adding warning labels to the game's loading screens that the game should not be played during a class session.\nCriticism.\nSome agencies (organizations that service a special field) were worried that many children are not getting enough proper exercise and real-world social interaction because of playing games such as \"Fortnite\". Other agencies had warned parents that \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" causes children to do violent behavior. On April 2019, Prince Harry proposed that \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" should be banned. He believes \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" has a negative effect on society. He said, \"The game should not be allowed, It's created to addict children. An addiction to keep you in front of a screen for as long as possible. It's so irresponsible.\" \nReferences.\nExternal Links"}

This dynasty ruled most of the Northern states of India. This dynasty ruled India for a huge period from the 7th century to the 11th century. They had Ujjain as the capital and later shifted to Kannauj.\nHistory.\nNagabhata I (730\u2013756) was the first ruler of the dynasty. He extended his control east and south from Mandor. He conquered Malwa as far as Gwalior and the port of Bharuch in Gujarat.He established his capital at Avanti in Malwa. Nagabhata I was famously known for defeating the Arab army of the Ummayyad Caliphates under Junaid and Tamin. Kakushta and Devaraja are two weak rulers who succeeded Nagabhata I. Vatsaraja (775\u2013805) was the next powerful ruler of the dynasty.\nConquest of Kannauj.\nKannauj kingdom was ruled by a weak ruler, after the death of Harshavardhana. The Pratiharas, The Palas and The Rashtrakutas fought to get control over Kannauj. But Vatsaraja of Pratihara defeated the Palas and the Rashtrakutas. Around 786, Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva (780\u2013793) crossed the Narmada River into Malwa. From there he tried to capture Kannauj and defeated Vatsaraja. \nVatsaraja was succeeded by Nagabhata II (805\u2013833). Nagabhata II was initially defeated by the Rashtrakuta ruler Govinda III (793\u2013814). But later recovered Malwa from the Rashtrakutas. He conquered Kannauj and the Indo-Gangetic Plain as far as Bihar from the Palas. He rebuilt the great Shiva temple at Somnath in Gujarat. Kannauj became the center of the Gurjara-Pratihara state. At this time, the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty covered much of northern India.\nRambhadra (833-c. 836) for a short time, succeeded Nagabhata II. Mihira Bhoja (c. 836\u2013886) expanded the Pratihara dynasty west to the border of Sindh, east to Bengal, and south to the Narmada. His son, Mahendrapala I (890\u2013910), expanded further eastwards in Magadha, Bengal, and Assam.\nDecline.\nBhoja II (910\u2013912) was the successor of Mahendrapala I . He was overthrown by Mahipala I (912\u2013944). Many kingdoms emerged independent using the weakness of Pratiharas. The south Indian Emperor Indra III (c. 914\u2013928) of the Rashtrakuta dynasty for a short time captured Kannauj in 916. Later again Pratihara ruler gained control over Kannauj. But the dynasty was still weakening due to the attacks of the Turks, Rashtrakutas and several other dynasties. Mahmud of Ghazni captured Kannauj in 1018, and the Pratihara ruler Rajapala fled (escaped). Somehow Rajapala was captured and killed by a Chandela Ruler named Vidhyadhara.The Chandela ruler then placed Rajapala's son Trilochanpala on the throne. Jasapala, the last Gurjara-Pratihara ruler died in 1036."}

He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as the governor of the new territory in 624 CE. Kubja Vishnuvardhana founded the Eastern Chalukya dynasty after the death of Pulikeshin II in the Battle of Vatapi.\nHistory.\nBetween 641 CE and 705 CE some kings, except Jayasimha I and Mangi Yuvaraja, ruled for very short durations. Then periods with weak rulers followed. At this time, the Rashtrakutas removed the Western Chalukyas of Badami. The weak rulers of Vengi had to face the Rashtrakutas. There was no Eastern Chalukya ruler who could fight against them. During the period of Gunaga Vijayaditya III, the Rashtrakuta emperor Amoghavarsha treated him as his ally (supporter). After Amoghavarsha's death, Vijayaditya made the state independent."}

Booba has since embarked on a successful solo career, selling more than 10 million discs over his career and becoming the most legally downloaded artist in French history.

His father is Senegalese and his mother is French.\nWith his friend Ali they formed the duo Lunatic in 1994. Unable to secure a record deal from a major label because of their controversial lyrics, they created their own independent record label 45 Scientific in 1999.

They lived in the lands of the Byzantine Empire (or Eastern Roman Empire) like Greece, Asia Minor and Cyprus. They spoke medieval Greek, preserved Greek culture, obeyed Roman law and followed Eastern Christianity. Their society had peasants, traders, teachers, soldiers and priests.\nIdentity.\nThe Byzantines called themselves Romans (\"Romaioi\"), Greeks (\"Graikoi\"\u2013\"Hellenes\") and Christians (\"Christianoi\") throughout their history. They used those names synonymously because they were the political heirs of the Roman Empire, the offspring of the ancient Greeks, and believers in Jesus Christ. The Byzantines also called everything that was not Greek \"barbarian\" and called paganism \"Hellenism\". \nSociety.\nByzantine Greek society had different classes like the poor, the peasants, the soldiers, the teachers, the merchants, and the priests.\nPoor and peasants.\nThere were two groups of poor people in the Greek world since the time of Homer: the \"ptochos\" (, \"passive poor\") and the \"penes\" (, \"active poor\"). Byzantine Greek peasants lived in villages, drank wine and ate grains, beans, fish, bread and olives. They were hunters, fishers, bee-keepers, craftsmen, smiths, tailors and shoemakers.\nSoldiers and teachers.\nSoldiers were chosen for military duty every year and served as medics and technicians. Their appearance, customs, habits and life were part of a Greek and Roman military tradition. Along with farmers, they ate a type of dried biscuit bread called a \"paximadion\" (originally called a \"boukelaton\").\nByzantine education was part of an ancient Greek educational tradition that started in the 5th century BC. It was made up of three levels: 1) elementary school with students aged six to ten years old, 2) secondary school with students aged ten to sixteen years old, 3) higher education.\nLiteracy was much higher in the Byzantine Empire than in Western Europe. Elementary school education was widely available in places like towns and the countryside. Secondary schools were mostly in larger cities and higher education was offered at the University of Constantinople.\nIn elementary schools, teachers used simple fairy-tale books like Aesop's Fables. In secondary schools, teachers used ancient Greek texts like the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" of Homer.\nWomen.\nThe life of a Byzantine Greek woman was split into three stages: 1) girlhood, 2) motherhood and 3) widowhood. Daily life for women included doing household and farm chores. Poor women sometimes wore sleeveless tunics and most wore a veil called the \"maphorion\" that covered their hair. Wealthy women bought and wore silk fabrics and clothes with expensive jewelry. Some women worked as traders, clerics and teachers.\nTraders and priests.\nByzantine Greek traders were mobile and developed new methods of investing money like the \"chreokoinonia\". Byzantine Greek priests were close to the rest of society and were allowed to get married (except for bishops)."}

{"id": "627892", "revid": "196884", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=627892", "title": "Sea ice", "text": "Sea ice is simply frozen ocean water. It forms, grows, and melts in the ocean. In contrast, icebergs, glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves all originate on land. Sea ice occurs in both the Arctic and Antarctic.\nDescription of Sea Ice.\nBecause sea ice is made of frozen seawater, it is salty (unlike icebergs). Sea ice generally grows in the winter (when it is often dark all day and night) and melts in the summer (when there is twenty-four hour daylight). Sea ice normally covers more area near in the Antarctic than the Arctic. Because the ice is salty, sea ice is heavier, less transparent and easier to break than ice that isn't salty.\nSea Ice Mechanical Properties.\nThe 'mechanical properties' of sea ice refer to how easy it is to bend, break, squash and stretch the ice. This behaviour is dominated by the fact that sea ice is not entirely solid - instead it contains lots of tiny pockets of salt water. Older ice also often contains many air bubbles. This makes it much easier to squash, break and snap than a normal ice cube in a drink.\nWhen two pieces of sea ice squash up against each other, they can crumple up and break to form a 'ridge' at the part where they touch. Before doing this they might bend. It is also relatively easy to pull apart a single piece of sea ice by pulling opposite edges in opposite directions.\nSea Ice Optical Properties.\nBecause sea ice has air bubbles and saltwater pockets inside it, it is much harder to see through than non-salty, clear ice. This is because light can't go through it without hitting the bubbles and pockets. Most sea ice in winter is covered by a layer of snow, which you also can't see through. All this means that when the sun shines on sea ice, not much of its light gets through to the sea below the ice. This limits the amount of algae and tiny plants that can grow in the sea. This is important because when the ice melts, much more light gets through and the algae and tiny plants can then thrive. This effect also keeps the sea below cooler.\nImportance to the people that live in the Arctic.\nAround four million people live in the Arctic, with many of them living near the sea. Many of these people have lived here for centuries, and have learned to use and depend on the sea ice to live. In particular, coastal residents of the Arctic travel over the sea ice and use it to hunt animals. This hunting is done both for food and to make clothes. Because some people spent a lot of their lives on the ice, it becomes very important to them and their communities.\nImportance to the animals that live in the polar regions.\nMay animals live on top of and under the sea ice. It makes life more difficult for some, but less difficult for others. Animals like seals and polar bears exist both on top of the sea ice, but also swim in the sea. Because microscopic plants and algae don't grow well under the sea ice because they need the sun, the animals that eat them (like fish) also spend less time under the ice.\nImportance to the climate.\nAlthough it's not smooth like a mirror, sea ice is very shiny. Most of the sunlight that hits it bounces off and shines back into space. By not absorbing a lot of sunlight, the poles stay cold. Having cold regions near the top and bottom of the earth is important for global weather, because it affects the way cold and warm air moves around. When cold air moves down from the Arctic, it can cause very serious storms. When warm air moves up into the Arctic, it can cause the sea ice to melt and break up.\nSea ice also acts as a barrier between the sea and the air. In the rest of the world, water is often evaporating from the sea to the air. Eventually when the air fills up with water, it rains. Sea ice strongly reduces this transfer, so the air is very dry and it doesn't rain or snow very much.\nSea ice also reduces the amount of heat that flows from the sea to the air.\nSea ice is important for the mixing of the sea surface. When wind blows over the sea, it stirs the water and mixes it up. However when wind blows sea ice around, this mixing is much deeper, and the strength can change. This mixing is important because it affects the lives of microscopic animals that live at the sea surface, and it also affects how salty it is at the sea surface.\nSea ice is changing.\nHuman beings have been releasing a lot of greenhouse gases, which have been making the earth warmer. The Arctic in particular has been getting much warmer. One reason for this is because sea ice formation and melting is very sensitive to temperature changes. When the air is warmer, sea ice grows slower and melts faster.\nThese temperature rises mean that the sea ice begins growing later in the year, and begins melting earlier in the year. It also means that the area of sea ice is decreasing.\nSatellites and Sea Ice.\nGoing to the sea ice is difficult and sometimes dangerous. This makes it impossible to keep track of all the sea ice at once and see how its changing. To solve this, scientists often look at sea ice from space using satellites. There are many ways to do this. Some satellites use cameras that work similarly to common consumer ones. Others make pictures of the sea ice using microwave energy that can go through clouds. Some don't just look at the ice, but send down energy from laser and radar machines and then record how it bounces off the ice.\nThese satellites allow scientists to measure the area covered by sea ice relatively well. However they are still relatively unsure how thick the sea ice is, in part because it is unclear how much snow is resting on the ice at any one time. Measuring the amount of snow that exists on sea ice is difficult, European scientists are currently designing a new satellite called CRISTAL to help study it."}

However, that book was already quite long: it was published in two volumes. So the \"Expression of the Emotions\" was published separately in 1872.\nThe book is about the way emotional life is shown by the faces and actions of man and other mammals. Darwin sets out ideas that our systems of emotions are inherited, and have evolved in a similar way to the more familiar structural aspects of man and animals.\nHe explores the origins of such human characteristics as the lifting of the eyebrows in moments of surprise and the mental confusion which typically accompanies blushing. The book is very notable for being the first book to use photographs as the main way of showing scientific evidence. The field of study is now called \"behavioural genetics\". One line of evidence he uses is the way many different peoples in different parts of the world have similar facial and emotional reactions.\nDarwin's basic points were: a single origin for the entire human species, and universal human expressions. Also, there are obvious links between the way human emotions are shown and the way other mammals show their emotions. Our emotional displays are adapted from a more basic set of emotional displays common to many mammals. The emotional displays are inherited, automatic and are difficult to control with our conscious mind. They are operated by the more ancient unconscious mind. Modern research has shown that it is extremely difficult to avoid giving signs of our emotions.\nA German translation of \"The Expression\" appeared in 1872; Dutch and French versions followed in 1873 and 1874. A second edition of the book, with only minor alterations, was published in 1890."}

They transport water and mineral salts. Tracheids are one of two types of elements in the xylem, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids do not have perforation plates; vessel elements do. These define vascular plants, as opposed to non-vascular plants.\nAll tracheary elements get a thick lignified cell wall. When the plant is mature, the protoplast has broken down and disappeared. Tracheids have two functions. They transport material and provide structural support.\nThe secondary walls have thickenings in various forms: rings, spirals, networks or as extensive thickenings except where there are pits. Tracheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type.\nBecause tracheids have a much larger surface area to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring. This mechanism helps plants prevent air embolisms.\nThe term \"tracheid\" was introduced by Carl Sanio in 1863, originally as \"Tracheide\", in German."}

It is probably caused when two stars merge to become one. Their red colour is distinctive. The light curve near the star stays in the infared. Luminous red novae are different from normal novae. Those are explosions on the surface of white dwarf stars.\nHistory and discovery.\nThe first luminous red nova found was in the Messier 85 galaxy. It was discovered when people working at the Rickett Observatory were searching for supernovas. Astronomers from U.C. Berkeley and Caltech investigated it. They found that it was different from normal novae and thermal pulses. Afterwards, they announced that luminous red novae are a new type of star explosion.\nMore luminous red novae were found after the discovery. Researchers found V1309 Scorpii in 2008. The star system was a contact binary. Researchers were studying it for six years before it merged and exploded. In 2015, two different luminous red novae were found. One was in the Andromeda galaxy, and the other was in the Pinwheel galaxy. Astronomers think that in 2022, KIC 9832227 will merge and become a new luminous red nova. This star system is 1800 light years away from the Sun. A team from Calvin College found that the orbital period of the star system was slowing down and that the stars were coming closer to each other.\nTraits.\nLuminous red novae have these traits:"}

Over the centuries a large number of typefaces were designed, and the serif/sans-serif feature is just one of many issues which type designers have to deal with.\nHowever, the original source of the serif may be in monumental inscriptions.

It is not very well defined. The border between the two countries has constantly altered, and many of the small towns have been, at various times, on one side or the other.\nOn the English side. the area was the Kingdom of Mercia. The fortifications known as Wat's Dyke and Offa's Dyke were built by Mercian kings. The market towns on the English side (such as Shrewsbury and Hereford) were garrisoned.\nThe term \"March of Wales\" was used in the Domesday Book of 1086. Over the next four centuries the Norman rulers established Earldoms for the \"Marcher Lords\", whose job it was to patrol the Marches. Dozens of small castles were built in the border area in the 12th and 13th centuries. From the castles the Norman lords could patrol and defend the area against against Welsh raiders and rebels.\nUnder the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542 under Henry VIII, rule by the marcher lords was abolished in 1536. This had the effect of creating a single state and legal jurisdiction, \"England and Wales\". The powers of the marcher lordships were abolished, and their areas were organised into the new Welsh counties of Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire, Monmouthshire, and Carmarthenshire.\nIn present-day Britain, the boundary between England and Wales is more or less ignored. In fact, one can cross the border without knowing it, except that painted on the roads on the Welsh side are strange words such as \"Arif\".

Its agents search for the authors, co-perpetrators and alleged accomplices of those offences. If they likely to be on the French territory the Central Office can take action against them. \nThe motto of the OCLCH is: \"Hora fugit, stat jus\" (\"time passes, law remains\"). \nCreation and Missions.\nThe Central Office for Combating Crimes against Humanity, Genocide and War Crimes was created on 5 November 2013. Considering the offenses it is in charge of, it has the particularity of exercising its activity within the legal framework of universal jurisdiction. It regularly sends his investigators abroad using international rogatory commissions, to places where the facts have been committed. There, in co-operation with the local authorities, it gathers the elements useful to the manifestation of the truth. \nOrganization.\nLike the Central Office for Combating Environmental Crime and Public Health (OCLAESP), the Central Office for Combating Illegal Labor (OCLTI) and the , the OCLCH is attached to the sub-directorate of the Judicial Police of the Directorate General of the National Gendarmerie.\nThe OCLCH maintains specific international relations and in particular with the foreign judicial units specialized in this same field. It is the single point of entry into France for its foreign counterparts (american FBI, german BKA, ...). As a mirror image, it is the recipient of requests for mutual legal assistance addressed to France by foreign states or international institutions (International Criminal Court (ICC), International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), EULEX Kosovo, etc.).\nLed by a brigadier general (NATO nomenclature: OF6) from the Gendarmerie Nationale, the general Jean-Philippe Reiland, the Office staff consists of 30+ civil servants, coming from the gendarmerie, the national police and the Ministry of Defense. It is completed by operational reservists.\nIn August 2020 a division was created within the OCLCH dedicated to the fight against hate crimes, in particular racist, anti-Semitic, anti-religious or LGBT-phobic acts. This creation was motivated by the fact that, although the decree creating the OCLCH already included the fight against hate crimes in its missions, there were relatively few commitments by the office on these subjects, because it gave priority to the fight against crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. However, the increase in hate crimes over the years, which have been poorly taken into account, led to the decision to specialise a group of gendarmes on this particular mission, with a strong emphasis on monitoring social networks. There are seven gendarmes who investigate full-time in this division. The division can be contacted in different ways: either by a report on the Pharos platform, or by the public prosecutor's office to which a complaint has been filed. Its work is done in collaboration with the national centre for combating online hate. "}

In the program, presenters Joachim Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf present three independent show concepts. The studio audience decides that after all six shows have been presented, which show wins the title of the \"best show in the world\" or the \"worst show in the world\". It is agreed with voting devices that every spectator in the audience has since the beginning of the show. These \"remote controls\" can also be used for the interactive design of the show. The moderator is Jeannine Michaelsen. In the third and fourth edition, Oliver Kalkofe commented on the events and judged the respective shows.\nThe program is produced by Florida TV and was awarded the German Television Prize in 2017.\nShow concept.\nJoko Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf present three (up to four four) shows each with a length of about 20 to 30 minutes. The presented shows are partly new show ideas, but are also based on existing TV show formats, which are slightly modified and parodied. At the same time, the two of them may force each other to participate in a show once per appointment (\"Joker\").\nIn the first four episodes, the studio audience with voting devices determined the audience for the show shown, which was the TV viewer at home live as a graphic superimposed. This graphic has been removed with Issue 5 of December 2, 2017. Each of the 600 people in the studio could switch on or off during the show, as if sitting at home in front of the TV, using their voting device, which acts like a remote control. Over the entire running time of the show could be switched on or off as often as you like. The course of the ratings was therefore close to how good or bad the show arrived at the studio audience. This was only visible to the television viewer at home, not for the studio audience. Until the second installment of the program, a \"cloud of light\" consisting of white spheres fixed above the studio and illuminated with lasers was installed in the studio, which had visualized the audience rating by their brightness. The more spectators from the studio audience turned on, the brighter the cloud of light became. Since the third edition, these are no longer available.

It connected Rome with Mogadiscio in Italian East Africa, and from 1939 the route could be travelled without a change of airplane. The route was a key political and symbolic connection between Rome, the 'capital of Italy's Empire', and Italy's colonies in Libya and East Africa.\nHistory.\nThe line was opened after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and was followed by the first air links with the Italian colonies in Italian East Africa, which had begun in an experimental way from 1934. The route was enlarged to 6,379\u00a0km and initially joined Rome with Addis Ababa via Syracuse, Benghazi, Cairo, Wadi Halfa, Khartoum, Kassala, Asmara, Dire Dawa. There was a change of aircraft in Benghazi (or sometimes in Tripoli).\nThe route was carried out in three and a half days of daytime flight and the frequency was four flights per week in both directions. Later from Addis Ababa there were three flights a week that continued to Mogadishu, capital of Italian Somalia.\nIn 1939 the time taken to travel the route was reduced with the introduction of the new Savoia-Marchetti \"Marsupiale\", an aircraft that did not require change of aircraft. The flight lasted just 2 days and connected Rome to Tripoli-Cairo-Kassala-Asmara-Addis Abeba-Mogadiscio. In early 1940 it was the fastest and longest route in Africa and was the most prestigious line of Italian civil aviation.\nIn summer 1940, with the start of WWII the route was militarized and controlled by the \"Comando Servizi Aerei Speciali\". In the first months of 1941 it was definitively closed when Italy lost the Africa Orientale Italiana.\nAircraft.\nThe Empire Line was opened using the three-engined seaplane CANT Z.506 in the stretch Rome \u2013 Benghazi/Tripoli and the three-engined land-based Savoia-Marchetti SM-73 from Benghazi/Tripoli to Addis Abeba and Africa Orientale Italiana.\nIn 1938 entered service the faster Savoia-Marchetti SM-75 with greater autonomy, capable of carrying a nearly 5000\u00a0kg load of mail and up to twenty-four passengers. This aircraft was used from the beginning of 1939 and made it possible -thanks to improved flight authonomy and top speed of 370kmh- to eliminate the change of aircraft, to reduce the number of stopovers and to shorten the travel time of a full day."}

If he even thinks about leaving her, she weeps.

Using a telescope from the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, English astronomer Edmond Halley rediscovered this object in 1677, listing it as a non-stellar object. In 1715, it was published by Halley among his list of six \"luminous spots or patches\" in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\".\nOmega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eye. It appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area. It is the brightest, largest and, at 4 million solar masses, the most massive known globular cluster in the Milky Way. Of all the globular clusters in the Local Group of galaxies, only Mayall II (orbiting the Andromeda Galaxy) is brighter and more massive.

The idea is to find the age of an object or event by comparing it to another object or event, or by using clues from the environment or circumstances where it was found. Relative dating is not about finding the absolute age. In geology, rock or superficial deposits, fossils and lithologies can be used to correlate one stratigraphic column with another. Before the discovery of radiometric dating in the early 20th century, archaeologists and geologists used relative dating to determine ages of materials. \nRadiometric dating, on the other hand, is a means of absolute dating. Relative dating can only determine the \"order\" in which a series of events occurred, not \"when\" they occurred. Even so, it remains a useful technique. Relative dating by biostratigraphy is the preferred method in paleontology and is, in some respects, more accurate. Steno's Law of Superposition states that older layers will be deeper in a site than more recent layers. This law was the 'relative dating' method of choice in geology from the 17th century to the early 20th century"}

It helps many bony fish (but not cartilaginous fish) to control their buoyancy.\nFish with a swim bladder can stay at their current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming. The dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the center of volume, so it acts as a stabilizing agent. Also, the swim bladder is a resonating chamber, to produce or receive sound.\nSwim bladders are evolutionarily closely related (i.e., homologous) to lungs. Traditional wisdom has it that the first lungs (simple sacs connected to the gut) allowed the fish to gulp air in oxygen-poor conditions. They evolved into the lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and some fish (lungfish, gar, bichir) and also into the swim bladders of the ray-finned fishes."}

{"id": "630941", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=630941", "title": "Hotarubi no Mori e", "text": " is a Sh\u014djo manga. It was written by Yuki Midorikawa. It was shown in the \"LaLa DX\" magazine in July 2002. After, in July 2003, the manga was recreated as tank\u014dbon short stories. The manga is about a girl called Hotaru and her friend Gin. Gin is a young man that wears a mask. They met when Hotaru was six in a forest. Hotaru learnt that if she touched Gin, he would disappear forever. Hotaru comes back every summer so that she can spend time with Gin. Many people think that \"Hotarubi no Mori e\" was a starting point for another book that was also written by Yuki Midorikawa. That was called \"Natsume's Book of Friends\".\nAn anime movie that had the same name as the manga was created. It was 44 minutes and it was released in 2011. It was made in a studio called Brain's Base. The director of the movie was Takahiro Omori. The main voice actors of the movie were Ayane Sakura and K\u014dki Uchiyama. Some of the music in the movie was made by Makoto Yoshimori. Many people enjoyed the movie and many people were big fans for a long time after the movie was released. The movie came out on 17 September 2011. It was showed at the Scotland Loves Animation festival, the Leeds International Film Festival, Anime Expo, and the 66th Mainichi Film Awards.\nThe movie came out on blu-ray and DVD in Japan. This was on 22 February 2012. An extra story that was called also came out. This came out in a special version of the manga. The special manga and the blu-ray were on number 13 of the Oricon list. People that reviewed the movie said that the movie was very good. They said that it was a beautiful and simple movie. They compared the movie to movies by Hayao Miyazaki and Makoto Shinkai.\nStory.\nThe original manga and movie have the same story. A six-year-old girl called Hotaru Takegawa gets lost in a forest. Many \"yamagami\" and \"y\u014dkai\" live in this forest. A person wearing a mask called Gin finds Hotaru. Gin tells Hotaru that if she touches him, he will disappear. He helps Hotaru get out of the forest. Later, Hotaru keeps visiting Gin in the forest. They become friends, but Hotaru has to go back home in the city for school. Hotaru promises Gin that she will keep coming back each year.\nHotaru grows up but Gin doesn't grow. Hotaru's age quickly becomes closer to Gin's age. When Hotaru becomes a teenager, she finds it hard to keep their friendship together. This might be because they love each other a little bit and that their future together seemed very uncertain. Gin wishes that he could touch and hold Hotaru, but he cannot. One year, Gin takes Hotaru out on a date in a festival. This festival was organised by the spirits. Gin accidentally touches a human boy. He disappears, but he and Hotaru hug. They both tell each other that they loved one another. Hotaru soon moves on with her life near the end of the story.\n\"Hotarubi no mori e Tokubetsu-hen\".\nIn , the story is told from Gin's point of view. When Hotaru leaves after the summer, some of the \"y\u014dkai\" try to cheer Gin up. They give him some persimmons. Persimmons were a very special treat on the mountain. Gin wants to share a persimmon with Hotaru next year. He goes up to the top of a mountain to find ice so that he can preserve a persimmon but he could not find any ice. One of the spirits named Matsumino feels sorry for him and tries to bring the persimmon to Hotaru. Matsumino gets lost on the way there and eats the persimmon. At the end of the story, Hotaru comes back the next summer. Gin thinks about if he can tell Hotaru that he loves her.\nCreation.\nManga.\nThe author of \"Hotarubi no Mori e\" said that the idea for the story came to her really easily. She said this in the postscript of \"Aizoban Hotarubi no Mori e\". She said that she wanted to write a harder story when she had more experience in writing manga. She wrote it before she thought she would because she was scared that she would lose the idea. There were not too many issues while she was writing even though she had many different ideas. Midorikawa wanted to draw many different scenes in the story. She wanted to do a forest in the summer that had a lot of shadows. This was because she wanted to add more colours in the manga. She also wanted to do a calm summer festival and Gin's mask.\nMany people think the love story between Hotaru and Gin was the starting point for \"Natsume's Book of Friends\". This is because both stories have humans and \"y\u014dkai\" interact together. In both of these stories, there are many differences between the characters. Many things stop their relationships and how they understand each other.\nMidorikawa wrote another part of the story in 2011. This was before the anime movie's release. It was called \"Hotarubi no Mori e Tokubetsuhen\". She didn't want to add to the story at first, because the story was already finished. Because of this, she wrote from Gin's point of view.\nAnime.\nThe animation director, who was Yumi Satou, said that he began making the anime because he liked to animate original manga. The movie was approved in the beginning of 2011. The movie's producer (Shuko Yokoyama) said that the movie was supposed to be an original video animation. If it was made as an original video animation, it would not be released in theatres. But another movie, \"Natsume's Book of Friends\" was very popular and it allowed them to make a movie. This was because the same people that made \"Hotarubi no Mori e\" also made \"Natsume's Book of Friends\". The movie was made by the studio Brain's Base. It was directed by Takahiro Omori and it starred Japanese voice actors Ayane Sakura as Hotaru and K\u014dki Uchiyama as Gin. Satou and Yokoyama worked with each other a lot before this. Not that many people worked on the movie. This is because the movie was very short. The movie was made in Japan instead of other countries. Anime are usually made in different countries."}

This may be because they do not understand that what they are doing is not good for them; they do not realise that it might make them ill or get them into trouble.\nPeople can also lack capacity if they are unable to communicate in any way; for example, if they're in a coma or if they have severe brain damage. In this case, it may be necessary for someone else, such as an advocate or a Judge to make decisions for them by making a court order.\nIn some countries, like the United Kingdom, laws exist which tell those working with people whose capacity might be in doubt, what they must do and how to decide if someone is capable of making their own decisions. In the UK, this law is called the Mental Capacity Act (2005). It lists 5 rules which must be used as a guide; in simple terms, they are:\nThis law also allows people who have capacity, to pick someone else to make their decisions for them, in the case that they can't do it themselves.\nSupposing a person is unable to make decisions for themselves, what happens then? In the UK (and many other countries) there is a legal framework to make sure no-one takes advantage of the said person. It often consists of a physician or psychiatrist dealing with the person in question, a solicitor representing the person, and a solicitor representing the \"public interest\" (the state). Meetings are held at agreed times, say once every three months. The purpose is to make sure that decisions taken are in the person's interest."}

Her role was known as Special Operations Executive (SOE). She was twice parachuted into France to help the French resistance activity against German forces (the Wehrmacht).\nDuring her second mission, Szabo was caught by the Germans. She was interrogated, and sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp in Germany, where she was treated harshly. Like most other prisoners, she had to perfom hard work in freezing cold conditions with few clothes. She was shot near the end of the war. After her death, she was awarded the George Cross, the Croix de Guerre and the Medaille de la Resistance.\nSzabo's father was British, and her mother was French.\nEarly life.\nViolette Szabo was born Violette Reine Elizabeth Bushell in Paris on 26 June 1921. Her father was a taxi-driver and car salesman, and her mother was a dressmaker. During her childhood, Violette lived in both France and England at different times. She could speak both languages well. When the Second World War broke out, she was working at \"Le Bon March\u00e9\", a Brixton department store.\nSzabo married \u00c9tienne Szabo in 1940. He was a Hungarian non-commissioned officer in the French Foreign Legion. Violette was 19, \u00c9tienne was 31.\nAfter her marriage, Violette became a switchboard operator for the General Post Office in central London, working throughout the blitz. Bored by the job, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) on 11 September 1941. Szabo found within weeks that she was pregnant, so she left the ATS to return to London for the birth.\nViolette sent her baby to childminders while she worked at the South Morden aircraft factory where her father was stationed. Then she was told of her husband's death in action. \u00c9tienne had died on 24 October 1942 at the beginning of the Second Battle of El Alamein; he had never seen his daughter. It was \u00c9tienne's death that made Violette accept an offer to train as a field agent in the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). It was her best way to fight the enemy.\nSpecial Operations Executive.\nSzabo was sent to the SOE \"finishing school\" at Beaulieu, Hampshire, where she learnt escape and evasion, uniform recognition, communications and cryptography. She had training in weaponry. The final stage in training was parachute jumping. On her first attempt, Szabo badly sprained her ankle and was sent home to recover (it was this ankle that was to fail her later in France). She was able to take the parachuting course again and passed with a second class in February 1944.\nIn 2012 Max Hastings wrote that Szabo was \"adored by the men and women of SOE both for her courage and endless infectious Cockney laughter\", while Leo Marks remembered her as \"A dark-haired slip of mischief...She had a Cockney accent which added to her impishness\".\nAwards.\nSzabo was only the second woman to be awarded the George Cross. Both Violette and \u00c9tienne Szabo were awarded the French Croix de Guerre for their bravery in the field. On 17 December 1947 their five-year-old daughter Tania received the George Cross from King George VI on behalf of her late mother.

These bacteria are related to the ones that cause leprosy and those that cause tuberculosis. The disease can be found in tropical regions, but is not limited to the tropics. It is common in Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia. Currently, it is unknown in what way the disease spreads. It often occurs in rural areas close to swamps, rivers, or lakes. For this reason, vector organisms such as mosquitoes appear likely. \nThere are different forms of thearpy: the most common one consists of a combination two or three different drugs, and removing the affected tissue. Simple tissue removal looks promising, when no ulcers have formed yet. The bacterium does not support temperatures above 40 \u00b0C. For this reason, some forms of therapy have included heating the affected skin parts above 40\u00b0C. This will kill the bacteria. First attempts suggest that after killing the bacteria, the ulcer will heal in several cases. Even 18 months after the treatment, the disease no longer shows. This means that the method can be tested on more people.&lt;ref name=\"DOI10.1371/journal.pntd.0000380\"&gt;Thomas Junghanss, Alphonse Um Boock, Moritz Vogel, Daniela Schuette, Helmut Weinlaeder, Gerd Pluschke, David J.

It was officially formed on 22 July 1940 under Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton. It was formed by combining three existing secret organisations. Its purpose was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, and to aid local resistance movements. Later there were also reconnaissance missions in occupied Southeast Asia.\nOne of the organisations from which SOE was created was also involved in the formation of the Auxiliary Units, a top secret \"stay-behind\" resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a German invasion of Britain.\nFew people were aware of SOE's existence. Those who were part of it or liaised with it sometimes referred to as the \"Baker Street Irregulars\", after the location of its London headquarters. It was also known as \"Churchill's Secret Army\" or the \"Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\". Its various branches, and sometimes the organisation as a whole, were concealed for security purposes behind names such as the \"Joint Technical Board\" or the \"Inter-Service Research Bureau\", or fictitious branches of the Air Ministry, Admiralty or War Office.\nSOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal Allies (the Soviet Union and the United States). It also made use of neutral territory on occasion, or made plans and preparations in case neutral countries were attacked by the Axis. The organisation directly employed or controlled just over 13,000 people, about 3,200 of whom were women.\nAfter the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946. A memorial to SOE's agents was unveiled on the Albert Embankment by Lambeth Palace in London in October 2009."}

People know him for his books about Japan, especially his collections of Japanese legends and ghost stories, such as \"\". In the United States, Hearn also wrote about the city of New Orleans. He also used the Japanese name .\nLife.\nEarly life.\nHearn was born in and named after the island of Lefkada, one of the Greek Ionian Islands, on 27 June 1850. He was the son of Surgeon-Major Charles Bush Hearn (of County Offaly, Ireland) and Rosa Antoniou Kassimatis, a Greek woman.\nEmigration to Ireland, abandonment.\nA complex series of conflicts and events led to Lafcadio Hearn being moved from Greece to Ireland, where he was abandoned first by his mother (leaving him in the care of her husband's aunt), then his father, and finally by his father's aunt, who had been appointed his official guardian.\nIn 1857, he was seven years old. Both his parents were still alive, but his great aunt, Sarah Brenane, took care of him. Hearn began exploring Brenane's library and read a lot of Greek literature, especially myths.\nCatholic education, abandonment.\nIn 1861, Hearn's aunt sent him to the Institution Eccl\u00e9siastique, a Catholic church school in Yvetot, France. Hearn learned to dislike Catholic education. Hearn became fluent in French and would later translate into English the works of Guy de Maupassant, who coincidentally attended the school shortly after Hearn's departure.\nIn 1863, entered St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, a Catholic seminary at what is now the University of Durham. At age 16, Hearn injured his left eye in a schoolyard accident. The eye became infected. He left school for one year. He became blind in that eye. Hearn also myopia, so he had poor vision for the rest of his life. Hearn was embarrassed by his appearance, so he covered his left eye.\nIn 1867, Henry Molyneux, who had become Sarah Brenane's financial manager, went bankrupt, along with Brenane. There was no money for tuition, and Hearn was sent to London's East End to live with Brenane's former maid. She and her husband had little time or money for Hearn, who wandered the streets, spent time in workhouses, and generally lived an aimless, rootless existence. His main intellectual activities consisted of visits to libraries and the British Museum.\nEmigration to Cincinnati.\nBy 1869, Henry Molyneux had some money. He bought Hearn a one-way ticket to New York and told him to go to Cincinnati, find Molyneux's sister and her husband, Thomas Cullinan, and ask them for help. Cullinan gave him $5 and wished him luck. He was very poor and lived in stables or store rooms in exchange for hard work. \nNew Orleans.\nHearn lived in New Orleans for nearly a decade. He worked for several newspapers and magazines. He also translated the French author Gautier into English. Hearn also published in \"Harper's Weekly\" the first known written article (1883) about Filipinos in the United States, the Manilamen or Tagalogs, one of whose villages he had visited at Saint Malo, southeast of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.\n\"Two Years in the French West Indies\".\nHarper's sent Hearn to the West Indies as a correspondent in 1887. He spent two years in Martinique, He wrote for the magazine and wrote two books: \"Two Years in the French West Indies\" and \"Youma, The Story of a West-Indian Slave\", both published in 1890.\nLater life in Japan.\nIn 1890, Hearn went to Japan as a newspaper correspondent. In Japan, he found a home and his greatest inspiration. Basil Hall Chamberlain helped Hearn get a teaching job during the summer of 1890 at the Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School in Matsue. The Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum and his old home are still two of Matsue's most popular tourist attractions. In Matsue, Hearn married Koizumi Setsu, the daughter of a local samurai family. They had four children together. He became a naturalized Japanese and changed his name to Koizumi Yakumo, in 1896. He followed many religions: first Greek Orthodox, then Roman Catholic, and, later on, Spencerian. Finally, he became Buddhist.\nDuring late 1891, Hearn started teaching in Kumamoto, Ky\u016bsh\u016b, at the Fifth Higher Middle School. He worked there for three years and completed his book \"Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan\" (1894). In October 1894, he got a job as a journalist with the English-language newspaper \"Kobe Chronicle\". In 1896, he began teaching English literature at Tokyo Imperial University. He taught there until 1903. In 1904, he became a professor at Waseda University.\nOn 26 September 1904, he died of heart failure. He was 54 years old. His grave is at the Z\u014dshigaya Cemetery in Toshima, Tokyo.\nIn the late 19th century, Westerners knew little about Japan. However, the Exposition Universelle of 1900 made Japanese styles fashionable in Western countries. So, Hearn became well-known because of his books about Japan. Later, some critics said Hearn made Japan seem too exotic. But, he gave the West some of its first descriptions of pre-industrial and Meiji Era Japan, so his work has value.\nWorks.\nBooks by Hearn about Japan.\nSource:\nFurther reading.\nTrilingual Book: Greek, English tr.

{"id": "632089", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=632089", "title": "Rekawka", "text": "Rekawka - a Polish folk festival celebrated on the first Tuesday after Easter Sunday in Krakow, on the Krak Mound (also known as Krakus Mound). It is an ancient tumulus, not far from one of the oldest churches in Krakow \u2013 St. Benedict\u2019s church.\nHistory.\nRekawka\u2019s beginnings go back to the ancient Slavic springtime celebrations, called Dziady. For ancient Slavs, spring was a time of burning sacred fires to celebrate the dead, and of planting sacred groves. They also had the custom of leaving food for the dead. The Krak Mound might have been one of such places where they held their celebrations.\nThese ancient Slavic traditions evolved over time, and customs changed. In the 19th century, it was customary for rich citizens of Krakow to throw coins, apples, sweets and boiled eggs down the grassy slope of the Krak Mound to be picked up by poor local people. Some historians see it as a continuation of the Slavic traditions of leaving food for the dead.\nThe name of the festival.\nThe name of the festival, Rekawka, might go back to the times of a legendary Slavic prince, Krak (or, Krakus). The legend says that Krak was the founder of the city of Krak\u00f3w, and a great ruler. After his death, the people of Krak\u00f3w built a high mound in his honour. To build the mound, they were carrying up the earth in their sleeves (Polish \"rekaw\" \u2013 \"sleeve\") \u2013 and, that is why the festival is called Rekawka. \nHowever, the festival\u2019s name might also come from the Old Slavic words \"raka\", \"rakev\", meaning \"grave\" or \"burial\". While excavating the mound, archaeologists found man-made objects from many different cultures and different periods \u2013 from the Stone Age to modern times. And, they also found some burial remains. These finds give evidence to the Old Slavic origin of the mound\u2019s name.\nRekawka in modern times.\nNowadays, Rekawka has a popular, folk character. If the weather is warm and sunny, it can be an occasion for a pleasant family outing. There are stalls selling sweets and toys, merry-go-rounds, and street musicians. More recently, the festival has been featuring medieval knights fighting each other in mock duels,and medieval craftsmen at work. There is also an opportunity to taste traditional dishes such as ko\u0142acze."}

The prison is said to be breaking international human rights laws, as prisoners have been held without trial , and there have been reports of prisoners being tortured.\nHistory.\nBush administration.\nThe prison was established under the presidency of George W. Bush, in 2002 during the War on Terror. The Secretary of Defense at the time was Donald Rumsfeld, who said that the prison was built to hold dangerous people, question them, and charge them with war crimes: \"These men are particularly dangerous... at least one detainee now in Cuba has been threatening to kill Americans. Another has bitten a guard... To stop future terrorist attacks, we have detained these people, and we have and will be questioning them to gather additional intelligence information...The reality is that they have been charged with something. They have been found to be engaging on the behalf of Al-Qaeda or the Taliban and have been captured.\" \nSince January 2002, 779 men have been kept in Guantanamo. These men have been from over 50 countries. Nearly 200 were released in mid 2004. \nAlthough the Bush govenrnment said that most of the men had been captured at war, a 2006 report found that over 80% of the prisoners were captured by Pakistanis and Afghans for bounty payments. The US had offered $5,000 for each prisoner. \nIn 2012, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson said that US officials (including president Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld) had known that most of the original prisoners were innocent, but kept them to make themselves look better \nA report by the \"Institute on Medicine as a Profession\" in 2013 said that health professionals in Guantanamo \"designed and participated in cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and torture of detainees.\" This involved:\nMorris Davis (former chief prosecutor for the terrorism trials at Guantanamo Bay), began an e-petition to close Guantanamo. The e-petition got over 72,000 signatures, and called attention to the huger strikes that 'involves more than 100 prisoners, including come 21 who are being force-fed to keep them from starving to death.\" \nOn 12 December 2013, retired US marine Major General Micheal R Lehnert (who oversaw the building of the Guantanamo prison camp) published a piece in the Detroit Free Press. He called Guantanamo \"out nation's most notorious prison - a prison that should never have been opened\", and provided a short description of its history:\n\"Our nation created Guantanamo because we were legitimately angry and frightened by an unprovoked attack on our soil on September 11, 2001. We thought that the detainees would provide would provide a treasure trove of information and intelligence.\n\"I was ordered to construct the first 100 cells at Guantanamo within 96 hours [4 days]. The first group of 20 prisoners arrived 7 days after the order was given. We were told that the prisoners were the 'worst of the worst', a common refrain for every set of detainees sent to Guantanamo. The US has held 779 men there, most of them cleared for transfer, but stuck by politics.\n\"Even in the earliest days of Guantanamo, I became more and more convinced that many of the detainees should never have been sent in the first place. They had little intelligence value, and there was insufficient evidence linking them to war crime [they didn't know anything, and there was little proof they had committed war crimes]. That the remains the case for many, if not most, of the detainees.\"\nObama administration.\nIn his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama described Guantanamo bay as a sad chapter in America's history and promised to close the prison in 2009. He changed this statement after he was elected. President Obama was not able to close Guantanamo before he left office, but he did reduce the prison's population to 41. \nTrump administration.\nPresident Trump has promised to keep the prison open, and to use it keep \"bad dudes\". He also wants to bring back waterboarding and \"worse\".\nOn 31st January 2018, Trump signed an order to keep the prison open.\nTorture claims.\nIn court filings made public in 2007, FBI agents said that they saw prisoners:\nOther claims include:\nMurder accusations.\nOn 10 June 2006, three prisoners (Mani al-Utaybi, Yasser al-Zahrani, Ali Abdullah Ahmed died in Guantanamo Bay. The Pentagon told the media that the prisoners had been hanged with clothing and bedsheets.\n\"[The detainees] were found unresponsive and not breathing in their cells by guards.\n\"Medical teams responded quickly and all three detainees were provided immediate emergency medical treatment in attempts to revive them. The three detainees were pronounced dead by a physician after all life saving measures were exhausted.\"\n- Statement issued by Joint Task Force Guantanamo \nFamilies of all three detainees doubted the post mortems and wanted second post mortems done. Patrice Malign (the pathologist who re-examined al-Zahrani's body) said that the organs of al-Zahrani's throat were missing. His team could not find if al-Zahrani had hanged himself or died of another form of asphyxiation. The team said that there is no reason for there organs to have been removed. The US government has never given the missing organs back to the family.\nLegal issues.\nPresident Bush's military order.\nOn 14th September 2001, Congress pushed for the \"Authorisation for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists\", which would have given the President broad powers to start The War on Terror in response to the 9/11 attacks. However, Secretary of State Colin Powell and State Department Legal Advisor William Howard Taft IV said that the president must observe the Geneva conventions.\nOn 13th November 2001, President Bush signed a military order titled \"Detention, Treatment and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism\".\nRasul v Bush.\nOn 19th February 2002, Guantanamo detainees petitioned to review their detentions and the reasons for them. US District Judge Collen Kollar-Kotelly rejected the petition, finding that non-US citizens in Cuba could not access or use US courts.\nOn 28th June 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States decided against this in \"Rasul v Bush\" (UK prisoner in Guantanamo petitioning against Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision in 2002). Justice John Paul Stevens said that the prisoners had the right to petition the court to review their cases.\nHamden v Rumsfeld.\nThe Bush government said that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the prisoners. Supreme Court decisions since 2004 have said different: it decided in the \"Hamden v Rumfeld\" trial that Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (which sets rules for the treatment of prisoners of war) applies to the prisoners\nIn 2006, Deputy Defense Scretary Paul Wolfowitz created 'Combatant Status Review Tribunals' (CSRTs) to decide if prisoners were war criminals\nThe CSRTs were completed in March 2005. Thirty-eight of the prisoners were found innocent. After the autobiography of Murnat Kurnaz (Turk-German held in Guantanamo 2002-2007) was published, military lawyer Eugene R. Fidell said that the book \"suggested the [CSRT] procedure is a sham; if a case like that can get through then the [smallest trace] of evidence against someone would [win over] for the governments, even if there's a mountain [of evidence] on the other side.\" \nOn 15 July 2005, a panel on the Court of Appeals threw out all of the prisoners' petitions. On 7 November 2005 Supreme Court agreed to review that decision.\nOn 30 December, Supreme Court passed the 'Detainee Treatment Act' which removed the prisoners' right to petition for review.\nBoumedine v Bush.\nThe Military Commissions Act 2006 was passed on 17 October 2006, allowing trial in military court for war criminals. On 12 June 2008, the US Supreme Court decided against the government. Justice Antony Kennedy said that Guantanamo prisoners had the right to petition in federal court.\nOther court rulings.\nOn 3 March 2006, on order of US District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, the Department of Defense released the names of 317 of the 500 prisoners being held in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining 183 were held for privacy reasons.\nOn 27 September 2007, French Judge put back a conviction of six former Guantanamo prisoners. Defense lawyers for the men (who were all French citizens), accused the French government of working with the US on their detentions.\nOn 21 October 2008, US District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ordered the release of five Algerians and for a sixth to remain in Guantanamo.\nAccess to court.\nIn the summer of 2012, the US government rejected a bid to limit lawyers' access to Guantanamo prisoners. Instead lawyers were required to sign a \"Memorandum of Understanding\", meaning that they agreed to certain restriction when visiting the prisoners, including losing access to some classified information. This gave the Commander of the Joint Task Force of Guantanamo full control over lawyers' contacct with prisoners, including visits and letters. On 6 September, US District Judge Royce. C Lamberth rejected the argument that prison officers to take charge of meetings between lawyers and prisoners\nInternational law.\nIn April 2004, diplomats called for a investigation of Guantanamo Bay\nIn May 2007, the United Nations released a report for the UN Human Rights CouncilThe report said that the US had broken international law, Article 5 of the Geneva conventions, and the Nuremberg principles.\nIn April 2011, a report published in the Public Library of Science Medical Journal looked at nine prisoners for evidence of torture. They found that medical doctors at Guantanamo ignored or hid medical evidence of intentional harm and torture. \nGuantanamo lease agreement.\nThe base containing the prison camp is on territory that is recognized as sovereign Cuban territory. It is legally leased (rented) to the American Navy by the Cuban government through the 'Agreement between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval sites'. This suggests it is illegal for the US to hold a prison on the land.\nActions of some released prisoners..\nAbdallah Salih al-Ajmi committed a successful suicide attack in Mosul on 25 March 2008. Al-Ajmi had been released from Guantanamo in 2005 and transferred to where he was from. A Kuwati court later dropped all his terrorism charges.\nMoussa Zenmouri (37, Belgian of Moroccan descent) and Soufiane A (Algerian) were arrested on 24 July 2015 on charges of terrorism. They were release from Guantanamo in April 2005 and had been under police for suspected robbery.\nIbrahim al Qosi was featured in a video for 'Guardians of Shariah'as a religious leader in a high position in Al-Qaeda. Al Qosi was Osama bin Laden's accountant in the early 90's, and moved to Afghanistan with bin Laden in 1996. He was also bin Laden's chauffer. He was in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2012.\nOn 8th March 2016, Reuters reported that 111 of 532 prisoners released by the Bush administration and 7 of 144 released by the Obama administration have returned. So, 118 of 676 (17%) are confirmed to have returned to fighting, and a further 86 (13%) are suspected to have returned to fighting.\nIn March 2016, Paul Lewis (Pentagon employee tasked with closing Guantanamo) said that \"Americans have been killed by prisoners released from Guantanamo Bay\", He refused to give a total or say when the attacks occurred.\nCriticism and condemnation.\nHuman Rights Watch criticised the Bush administration in its 2003 world report, stating \"Washington has ignored human rights standards in its own treatment of terrorist suspects. It has refused to apply the Geneva conventions to prisoners of war from Afghanistan, and has misused the designation of 'illegal combatant' to apply to criminal suspects on U.S. soil.\" \nOn 25 May 2005, Amnesty International released its annual report calling the prison the \"gulag of our times\".\nIn November 2005, a group of experts from the United Nations on Human Rights called off their visit to Guantanamo Bay Camp Delta, saying that the US was not allowing them to hold private interviews with the prisoners. The group continued to write a report on the conditions in the prison based on interviews with released prisoners, lawyers, and human rights groups that had already visited. In February 2006, that report was published. The report called on the US to either charge or release all suspected terrorists, and included the US ambassador's reply to the draft versions of the report.\nOn 10 March 2006, a letter in the Lancet (a weekly medical journal) was published, signed by over 250 medical experts, calling for the US to stop force-feeding prisoners and close the prison. Dr David Nicholl (who wrote the letter), said that the definition of torture (that the US was using) as only actions that cause \"death or major organ failure\" was \"not a definition anyone on the planet is using.\" \nPolls run by the \"Program of International Policy\" (PIP) found that \"large majorities in Germany and Great Britain, and pluralities in Poland and India, believe the US has committed violations of international law at its prison on Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, including the use of interrogations.\" (This means that large amounts of people in Germany, Great Britain, Poland and India thought that the US was breaking international laws at Guantanamo Bay.) PIP found that a lot of the people who filled the polls said that they no longer saw the US as leaders of human rights because of Guantanamo."}

It is also called Alaskan Inuit. The name also refers to the people who speak the language. Outside Alaska, it it is also spoken on the Diomede Islands. People on Little Diomede speak it; people on Big Diomede spoke it. Big Diomede Island belongs to Russia, and is uninhabited since the end of World War II. The other speakers live in northern and northwestern Alaska, and part of the Northwest Territories. The Inupiat language is closely related to Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers in Alaska, and about 24.000 speakers in Canada. It is considered a threatened language with most speakers at or above the age of 40. I\u00f1upiaq is an official language of the State of Alaska.\nThe name is also rendered as Inupiatun, I\u00f1upiatun, I\u00f1upiaq, Inyupiaq, Inyupiat, Inyupeat, Inyupik, and Inupik.\nThe main varieties of the I\u00f1upiaq language are Northern Alaskan I\u00f1upiaq and Seward Peninsula I\u00f1upiaq. \nThere are differences in the three big dialects, both regarding the sounds and the words used. Speakers of two of the three dialects usually understand each other, even though the forms and words used are different. As an example: tupiq means tent in the North Slope dialect, and house in Malimut. The north slope dialect uses iglu to mean house. Sometimes the difference is mostly in spelling: dog is written as qimmiq in North Slope and qipmiq in Malimut. The dialect on the Seward peninsula is quite different, and speakers need some training to understand the two other dialects. \nThe I\u00f1upiaq language has been in decline since contact with English in the late 19th century. After Alaska became part of the US, many people from other parts moved there. The children of Inuit families were often put in boarding schools far away: There they learnt English, but they lost most of the Inuit languages their parents spoke, and the Inuit culture. This has led to a situation where only a small minority of Inupiat speak the I\u00f1upiaq language. Several communities try to revive the language, though."}

Warhol used silkscreen ink on synthetic polymer paint on canvas. Completed in 1962, it depicts the celebrity Marilyn Monroe. The image of Monroe is a direct copy of a close-up shot from her film \"\". This piece was completed the same year as the celebrity's untimely death.\nThe art currently resides at MoMA.\nMarilyn Monroe: The Celebrity.\nA sex icon with an innocent aura, Monroe lived a paradoxical life. She was a highly sought-after celebrity, yet she suffered from stage fright and anxiety. Once Monroe was immersed into Hollywood, she was an influential character but she was subject to the lifestyle that accompanies fame. As her popularity increased, her drug habits and anxiety got more and more out of control. This led to her eventual suicide in 1962.\nArtistic Technique of Gold Marilyn Monroe.\n(Andy) Warhol painted a large canvas a shiny gold color. In the center of the canvas and latex, he silk-screened a black and white photograph of Monroe. He painted her face, hair, and blouse. \nInterpretations.\nThe color gold is known to signify wealth, fame, illumination, and wisdom. It draws the eye to the central figure of the painting: Marilyn Monroe. The image of Monroe was not painted by Warhol. In fact, it is a direct copy of a close-up image from the film Niagara. This suggests to the reproductibility of Hollywood actors: Hollywood will always find new actors to replace old ones. Gold Marilyn Monroe includes a reproduction of an iconic image, but it is shown in a new light. She is encompassed by this ocean of gold, the relentless waters of Hollywood. Though Monroe\u2019s face is the main focal point, it is very small in relation to the whole canvas, signifying the effects of grandeur on the human psyche. Monroe\u2019s struggle with fame and drug addiction led to her eventual overdose and suicide in 1962. \nWarhol was entranced by the idea of fame and beauty, leading him to undergo a number of cosmetic surgeries in early adulthood. He dyed his hair metallic-white after college and got nose-reduction surgery in his mid-twenties. He was living in New York City when he created Gold Marilyn Monroe. He was much immersed into the celebrity lifestyle, frequenting Studio 54 and even producing television shows in his later years. It can be inferred that he idolized Marilyn Monroe and related to her struggles with anxiety. Gold Marilyn subtly conveys these struggles Monroe and Warhol both underwent.\nThe figure in the center of the canvas is empowered, yet oppressed. This dichotomy is synonymous to the life that Monroe led. As her popularity and stardom increased, her drug habits and anxiety got more and more out of control. The shiny-gold background of Gold Marilyn Monroe adds to the twinkling quality of Monroe\u2019s close-up. She appears to shine brighter amidst this already shiny color; this gives the impression that Monroe was her own entity, illuminating those around her. Although she was part of Hollywood, she created her own image and had a unique personality. She turned into a sex icon while still retaining elements of childlike innocence, a feat that many have failed to accomplish. She was known as a feminist, but she died before the feminist movement gained much traction. Monroe\u2019s life was very complex. Although she was a star, she struggled with stage fright. She had drug problems, but she was mostly successful in keeping it out of the public sphere. The Hollywood lifestyle was a catalyst for her eventual suicide. The gold background of Warhol\u2019s Gold Marilyn is the depiction of Hollywood; Marilyn is stuck right in the middle, unable to escape, lending to the oppressed feeling."}

He was a turkic slave of Muhammad of Ghor. The Mamluk dynasty ruled North India from 1206 to 1290. It was the first of five dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate, which lasted until 1526.\nIt is also known as yamini dynasty\nHistory.\nThe Mamluk, literally meaning \"owned\", was a soldier of slave origin (came from a slave background) who had converted to Islam. In the 9th century the Mamluks became a powerful military caste in Muslim societies. Mamluks held political and military power most notably in Egypt, but also in Levant, Iraq, and India.\nIn 1206, Muhammad of Ghor, Sultan of the Ghurid dynasty was assassinated. Since he had no children, his empire split into minor sultanates led by his former mamluk generals. \nTaj-ud-Din Yildoz became the ruler of Ghazni. Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji got Bengal. Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha became the sultan of Multan. Qutb ud-Din Aibak became the sultan of Delhi, and that was the beginning of the Slave dynasty. However, his reign as the Sultan of Delhi was short lived as he died in 1210. His son Aram Shah came to the throne, only to be assassinated by Iltutmish in 1211.\nThe Sultanate under Iltutmish established friendly contacts with the Abbasid Caliphate between 1228\u201329. He had managed to keep India unaffected by the invasions of Genghis Khan and his successors.Following the death of Iltutmish in 1236, a series of weak rulers remained in power. The throne shifted from Rukn ud din Firuz to Razia Sultana until Ghiyas ud din Balban, the last powerful ruler of this dynasty. The Khalji dynasty was established, when Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji overthrew the last of the Slave dynasty rulers, Muiz ud din Qaiqabad, the great grandson of Balban."}

Most leaf-mining insects are moths (Lepidoptera), sawflies (Symphyta, a type of wasp) and flies (Diptera). Some beetles also do this.\nLike woodboring beetles, leaf miners are protected from many predators and plant defences by feeding inside a leaf, eating its tissues. It eats only the layers that have the least cellulose. Also, when attacking \"Quercus robur\" (English oak), they feed on tissues with lower levels of tannin. Tannin is a chemical produced in abundance by the tree. It is not edible.\nThe pattern of the feeding tunnel and the layer of the leaf being mined shows what insect is responsible, sometimes even to the exact species. The mine often contains frass, or droppings, and the pattern of frass deposition, mine shape, and host plant identity show the species and instar of the leaf miner. A few mining insects feed in other parts of a plant, such as the surface of a fruit.\nIt has been suggested that some patterns of leaf variegation may be part of a defensive strategy used by plants. It deceives adult leaf miners into thinking that a leaf has already been preyed upon."}

It is the first elevated stacked island platform, as there is a possible future two-station extension to Tuas South leading out from this station or interchange with another line. The $190-million contract was awarded to Shanghai Tunnel Engineering, a major civil engineering company from China for this station.\nThis station ceiling is above ground - about the height of a 10-storey HDB (Housing Development Board) block, the highest elevated station along the MRT network. There are two reasons for the height. First, the 7.5\u00a0km, $3.5 billion extension goes over the Ayer Rajah Expressway viaduct at the Pan-Island Expressway interchange. Second, a 4.8\u00a0km portion of the line is being integrated with a road viaduct, which runs below the rail line.\nThe opening of the station was delayed from 2016 to the second quarter of 2017 to make way for the installation of the new signalling system.

The United States designated Jabhat al-Nusra as a foreign terrorist organization, followed by the United Nations Security Council and many other countries. It was the official Syrian branch of al-Qaeda until July 2016, when it became a separate organization. In early 2015, the group became one of the major components of the powerful jihadist joint operations room named the Army of Conquest, which took over large territories in Northwestern Syria.

On 10 December 2012, the U.S. designated Nusra a foreign terrorist organization and an alias of Al Qaeda in Iraq. That decision made it illegal for Americans to deal financially with Nusra. Days earlier, the American ambassador to Syria, R. Ford, had said: \"Extremist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra are a problem, an obstacle to finding the political solution that Syria's going to need\"."}

The battle was between Viking invaders and English Earls. It was fought by, on one side, King Harald III of Norway (Harald Hardrada (Old Norse, meaning \"hard ruler\") and his English ally Tostig Godwinson. On the other side were two Earls, Edwin and Morcar. Tostig was the exiled brother of the English king Harold Godwinson. The battle was fought out on the outskirts of the village of Fulford, close to York.\nThe battle was a decisive victory for the Viking army. The earls of York could have hidden behind the walls of their city. Instead, they met the Viking army across a river. All day the English tried to break the Viking shield wall but failed.\nEdwin and Morcar had survived the battle. York surrendered to the Norwegians. Harald had won the battle. One cause of the battle was that Earl Morcar had replaced Tostig as Earl of Northumbria.\nBackground.\nThe Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor died on 5 January 1066 without an heir. The only surviving member of the royal family was Edgar, the young son of Edward \u00c6theling. On the day of King Edward's funeral, 6 January, Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, rushed to London, where he was crowned king in the Abbey of Saint Peter of Westminster, by Ealdred, Archbishop of York. Harold Godwinson was elected as King by the Witenagemot, who had gathered in Westminster to celebrate the feast of Epiphany.\nHowever, two powerful earls, brothers Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria, challenged his authority. Sources indicate that Harold moved north to confront them; however, in the end he got their loyalty by marrying their sister, Edith, the widow of Griffith of Wales. By securing the loyalty of Edwin and Morcar, Godwinson increased his strength in the north. These men were, in fact, the first barrier between Harald Hardrada and Harold Godwinson.\nThe defeat of the earls had a big consequence. Because his enemies won, King Harold Godwinson had to force-march his troops , from London to York. He did this within a week of Fulford. He surprised the Viking army and defeated them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In the meantime William, Duke of Normandy, had landed his army in Sussex on the south coast.\nProbably the engagements at Fulford Gate and at the Battle of Stamford Bridge seriously affected Harold's strength at the Battle of Hastings some three weeks later. There is no doubt that if Harold had not been diverted by the battles in the north, he would have been better prepared to fight William at Hastings and the result might have been different."}

Now it is a bullion coin and is sometimes mounted in jewellery. \nA bullion coin is a coin struck from precious metal and kept as a store of value or an investment, rather than used in day-to-day commerce. The United Kingdom defines investment coins as \"coins that have been minted after 1800, have a purity of not less than 900 thousandths and are, or have been, legal tender in their country of origin\".\nIn most recent years, it has the well-known design of Saint George and the Dragon on the reverse\u2014the initials () of the designer, Benedetto Pistrucci, is to the right of the date.\nThe British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade. The Royal Mint took lightweight gold coins out of circulation. From the 1850s until 1932, the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints, initially in Australia, and later in Canada, South Africa and India. They have been struck again in India since 2013 for the local market. The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design, but by 1887, all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci's George and Dragon design. Strikings there were so large that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia.\nWith the start of the First World War in 1914, the sovereign vanished from circulation in Britain, replaced by paper money, and it did not return after the war, though issues at colonial mints continued until 1932. The coin was still used in the Middle East, and demand rose in the 1950s, which the Royal Mint eventually responded to by striking new sovereigns in 1957. It has been struck since then both as a bullion coin and, beginning in 1979, for collectors. Though the sovereign is no longer in circulation, it is still legal tender in the United Kingdom."}

It is based on the original work of Rudolf Laban, and many others helped to develop it. Its main and original purpose was to be a dance notation. Before film and video were developed, there was no way to record dance moves so that later dancers could use those moves. The transmission of dance from one generation to the next depended on older expert dancers teaching young dancers.\nThe problem was especially notable in modern dance, where the vocabulary of classical dance figures was expanded with almost no limits. Towards the end of his life, Laban extended his ideas into the movements workers made during physical work.\nLMA draws from many fields including anatomy, kinesiology and psychology. It is used by dancers, actors, gymnasts and many other groups. However, it is fair to say that it is now largely replaced by video recordings. Also, it is not the only kind of dance notation, and not the only way human movement can be written down as a record for later generations. And, it was not the first such system. For example, in the 1680s Pierre Beauchamp had a dance notation system for baroque dance, and in 1887/8 Eadweard Muybridge started to use film to record human and animal movement. It is film and video which has transformed our understanding of motion, rather than dance notation. But in its field the Laban notation was notable.\nDance which has been reliably recorded on notation and perhaps backed up by video recording, can be and has been used to copyright choreography."}

Essex County is in Ontario, Canada. Point Pelee is a peninsula of land and has many marshes and forest habitats. The shape of the park is a triangle with a sharp point in Lake Erie. Middle Island in Lake Erie is also part of the national park.\nThe national park is at the southernmost part of mainland Canada. The area is around by wide in the north part of the park. The park was created in 1918. It was the first national park of Canada that was created to protect the area. All of the other national parks of Canada were created at first for tourism. It became a Ramsar site on 27 May 1987. The park also became a dark-sky preserve in 2006.\nHistory.\nThe First Nations of Canada lived on Point Pelee for a long time. This was before the Europeans came to colonize the area. People think people used to live on the biggest archaeological site that was found at Point Pelee between AD 700 and 900. Point Pelee was named by two priests in 1670. They were Fathers Dollier and Galinee. The word \"pel\u00e9e\" is the French word for bald.\nNaturalists and hunters wanted to protect the area. They thought that the biodiversity of virds needed protection from land development in the area. Before the park was created, a group called the Great Lakes Ornithological Society was created. They studied the bird migration in the area. In 1915, they recommended that Point Pelee become a national park. It was the first national park that was created to protect the area. That changed how national parks were created. When the park was created, there were still many cottages in the area and two hotels. There were also many farms and a school.\nMany cottages were still being built after the national park was created. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, no more land in the park was sold. The park had a development plan in the 1920s. A highway was supposed to be built in the park. Beginning in the 1960s, a lot of people went to the park. Point Pelee became the national park that the most people went to. Almost 781 000 people went to Point Pelee in 1963. Because many people visited the park, a lot of the nature and wildlife was destroyed. The government of Canada said that Point Pelee should not be a national park anymore because of this.\nAfter the 1980s, the government of Canada began protecting the area more. They stopped allowing cars to drive to the tip. Instead, they began a shuttle to the tip. They began buying all the cottages in the park and removing them. They removed more than 350 buildings. They have also removed two roads. In 1989, duck hunting wasn't allowed in the park anymore. In 1991, the government began killing some of the deer in the park to protect the plants. They have killed some of the deer a few more times after that.\nPoint Pelee became a dark-sky preserve in 2006. It was the first national park of Canada to become a dark-sky preserve. In 2006, waves from Lake Erie washed away the tip. After this, in 2007, the tip reappeared. This was because Lake Erie's water level went down. The tip changes each year, growing longer or shorter. In 2017, a fire in Point Pelee burned down some of the marsh land. Around 125 hectares were burned down.\nGeography.\nThe park is in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. It is Canada's second smallest national park, after the Georgian Bay Islands National Park. This is because it is only . A very large area of the park is marshland and has ponds. This is 70% of the park. The rest of the park is mostly forest. Forests are 21% of the park. The sandspit around the park mostly has till plains. These till plains were created in the last Ice Age.\nClimate.\nPoint Pelee has a humid continental climate. It has warm and humid summers and cold winters. The temperatures of the park are changed by Lake Erie."}

She names the girl Yuki and the boy Ame. Not long after this, their father dies. Hana decides to keep raising the children.\nAs the children grow older, Hana finds it is hard to hide the werewolf powers inherited from their father: ultimately, she moves them to the countryside to avoid trouble from the public. She works hard to repair a house and grow their own food.\nAme becomes confident in himself after a near-death experience, and the children are allowed to attend school. Yuki adapts and makes friends, while Ame drops out to receive lessons from an old fox named Sensei about surviving in the wild. At this time, they are beginning to form their life paths.\nIn fourth grade, a transfer student named Souhei begins attending Yuki's class. He realizes she is not normal, and during a chase, Yuki accidentally injures his ear. He tells his mother a wolf attacked him, not Yuki. Over time, they become friends.\nAme and Yuki later fight each other over their \"real\" selves: neither sibling can agree whether or not they are wolf or human. Hana recognizes they are forming their futures, but is worried about it. Ame reveals that Sensei has been gravely wounded during a storm and will likely not survive, but then hints that he will succeed Sensei as the guardian of the wild. Hana is horrified by this, and begs him not to return to the forest.\nTwo years later, despite what Hana told him, Ame disappears into the forest during a severe storm to replace Sensei; Hana goes after him. She forgets to pick up Yuki from school, who is left alone with Souhei while the other students are retrieved. She decides to reveal herself as a wolf to him. He replies that he already knew and will keep her secret.\nHana gets hurt by a fall and dreams about her lover, who tells her that Ame will be fine with his chosen path. Ame picks her up and gets her to safety, but then turns into an adult wolf and runs off into the mountains. Hana is initially heartbroken as she believes she has not yet done anything for Ame, but soon recognizes he is now \"where he belongs\" and bids him farewell.\nThe next school year, Yuki leaves home to move into a dorm room with her friends in Junior High. Ame's howls are heard throughout the forest. Despite living alone in the house, Hana feels that she has raised her children well."}

Rice flour is also used as a thickening agent in recipes that are refrigerated or frozen.\nMany dishes are made from rice flour, including rice noodles and desserts like Japanese mochi and Filipino cascaron. Vietnamese banh canh uses rice flour and it is also used in making General Tso's chicken. In Chinese, it is called \"mifen\" (Chinese: \u7c73\u7c89; pinyin: m\u01d0 f\u011bn) Also it can be used in cooking, steamed, fried (fried rice noodlesChinese: \u7092\u7c73\u7c89; pinyin: ch\u01ceo m\u01d0 f\u011bn). Also it is used in other cuisine, such as galapong in Ilokano/Filipino, and pirin\u00e7 unu in Turkish cuisine. It can also be used to make rice bread.\nBrown rice flour can be combined with vermiculite for the cultivation of mushrooms. Hard cakes of colonised substrate can then be fruited in a humid container. This method is often (though not always) employed by growers of edible mushrooms. It is a very simple and low-cost method of growing mushrooms."}

The ECF was formed in 2004, and took charge in 2005.

It did not administer chess in the other countries of the UK. The BCF did have a British dimension, since it ran the British Chess Championship. This is one of two important tournaments held each year in Britain (the other is the annual international tournament at Hastings).\nFrom the 1990s there was a campaign for the BCF to become a company limited by guarantee, to bid for more sponsorship money.\nAt the start of the 2005/6 season the English Chess Federation was created, inheriting the BCF's assets and personnel. The former BCF still exists for legacy purposes, but its website was inherited by the ECF. The Scottish and Welsh Federations hold their own championships every year as they did before. Therefore the change does not make much difference to most players.\nThe situation in Ireland is more complicated. The Irish Chess Union since 1912 was the governing body for both the Republic and Northern Ireland. In 2005 the Ulster Chess Union broke away from the Irish Chess Union. These two groups were part of the original British Chess Federation, but are not in any way connected to the new English Chess Federation. All groups except the Ulster Chess Union are members of the International Chess Federation FIDE, and the European Chess Union."}

{"id": "634542", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634542", "title": "Transport in Singapore", "text": "Transport within Singapore is mainly land-based. Many parts of Singapore, including certain islands such as Sentosa and Jurong Island are accessible by road. The other major form of transportation within Singapore is rail: the Mass Rapid Transit which runs the length and width of Singapore, and the Light Rail Transit which runs within a few neighbourhoods. The main island of Singapore is connected to the other islands by ferryboat services.\nSingapore also has a great deal of links to the rest of the world. There are two bridges which link Singapore to Malaysia \u2013 the Causeway, and the Second Link. The Singapore Changi Airport is a major aviation hub in Asia, and Singapore is a major transshipment port.\nPublic transport.\nSingapore has one of the best public transport networks in the world, according to a study by London consulting firm Credo. Public transport\u00a0includes\u00a0bus, train, and taxi.\nRegulations.\nThe public transport system is regulated by the Land Transport Authority, which oversees the three main modes of public transportation. Fare regulation and bus service standards are under the purview of an independent body, the Public Transport Council, while TransitLink, established by SBS Transit, SMRT Trains and SMRT Buses, helps to create an integrated multi-modal system with a common fare-payment mode, information platform, and a physical network without duplication of services.\nThe policies of the Land Transport Authority are meant to encourage the use of public transport in Singapore. The key aims are to provide an incentive to reside away from the Central district, as well as to reduce air pollution. Singapore has a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) rail system consisting of five lines. There is also a system of bus routes throughout the island, most of which have air conditioning units installed due to Singapore's tropical climate. Besides cash, a contactless smart card called the EZ-Link card can be used to pay bus and MRT fares.\nStatistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Singapore, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 84 min. 25% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 11% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7.3\u00a0km, while 16% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nPublic transport for tourists.\nLaunched in December 2007 by Land Transport Authority, Singapore Tourism Board and EZ-Link, the Singapore Tourist Pass offers unlimited travel for tourists to Singapore on Singapore's public transport system. For S$10 a day (S$20 for 3 days, as of April 2017) and with S$10 deposit, tourists can take any number of rides on buses and trains operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and SMRT Trains. Certain buses like Night Rider, train service like Sentosa Express are not applicable. The Singapore Tourist Pass is available at selected MRT stations.\nRail transport.\nMass Rapid Transit (MRT).\nSingapore's public transport system has been mostly\u00a0buses, until the opening of the first section of the Mass Rapid Transit in 1987. Although buses still enjoy an average daily ridership exceeding the number carried on both the MRT and LRT systems (3.9 million on buses, compared to 3.1 million on the MRT and LRT in the year 2016), the Land Transport Authority plans to expand the rail system such that buses will eventually play only a feeder role to an extensive rail network.\nThe current MRT network consists of five main lines, for a total network length of and with 119 stations. The North South Line, East West Line and Circle Line are operated by SMRT Trains (SMRT Corporation), while the North East Line and Downtown Line since 22 December 2013, are run by SBS Transit. The Circle Line Extension from Promenade to Marina Bay began operation since 14 January 2012.\nLight Rail Transit (LRT).\nLight rail transit functioning as feeders to the main MRT network has been under study for some time, particularly since the existing urban configuration of self-containing new towns spread out in the suburbs meant it was feasible to consider having light rail systems connecting each town to the MRT station in the town centre, a role which has traditionally been provided by feeder buses. Thus, the first SMRT Light Rail (SMRT Corporation) operated LRT was opened in Bukit Panjang in 1999 to provide a connection to Choa Chu Kang in neighbouring Choa Chu Kang New Town. Although subsequently hit by over 50 incidents, some of which resulted in several days of system suspension, similar systems albeit from a different company were introduced in Sengkang and Punggol in 2003 and 2005 respectively, both operated by SBS Transit.\nOther Lines.\nSingapore has had other various forms of light urban rail systems, such as the monorail system on Sentosa island, which opened in February 1982. This 6.4\u00a0km, 6-station system was closed in March 2005 and a new Sentosa Express system was built by December 2006. The Changi Skytrain, a people mover system shuttling passengers between the three terminals at the Singapore Changi Airport, was opened originally in 1990 along with Terminal 2 and upgraded in 2006 with the completion of Terminal 3. The Jurong BirdPark previously featured an air-conditioned panorail which closed in 2012.\nRoad transport.\nTaxis and transportation network companies.\nTaxicabs are a popular form of public transport in the compact sovereign city-state of Singapore, with fares considered relatively low compared to those in most cities in developed countries. As of December 2014, the total taxi fleet in Singapore was 28,736 taxis, operated by 6 taxi companies and 178 independent drivers. Taxis may be flagged down at any time of the day along any public road outside of the Central Business District (CBD). However, increased usage of Uber and Grab has resulted in a decrease in the usage of taxis.\nAir transport.\nThere are six local scheduled service airlines, all of them operating from Singapore Changi Airport, offering scheduled flights to over 70 cities on six continents. The national flag carrier, Singapore Airlines, operates from Changi Airport Terminal 2 and 3. Its subsidiaries, SilkAir and Scoot, operate from Changi Airport Terminal 2.\nSingapore's two budget airlines, Jetstar Asia Airways and Valuair, operate from Changi Airport Terminal 1. Only one budget airline, Tiger Airways, chose to operate at the Budget Terminal; other budget airlines have cited various reasons for not shifting operations to the Budget Terminal, including accessibility and ease of transfers to connecting flights.\nThere are 6 airlines operate from Singapore. these are\u00a0\nAerial lift transport.\nCable car.\nThe Singapore Cable Car, plies between Mount Faber on the main island of Singapore and the resort island of Sentosa as an alternative means of accessing that tourist attraction. The cable car system underwent a revamp that was completed in August 2010.\nMaritime transport.\nWater transport within the main island is limited to the River Taxi along the Singapore River. The service was introduced in January 2013, with low ridership. There are also daily scheduled ferry services from the Marina South Pier to the Southern Islands such as Kusu Island and Saint John's Island.\nSingapore Cruise Centre (SCC) runs Tanah Merah and HarbourFront Ferry Terminals which are connected by ferry services to Indonesian Riau Islands of Batam, Bintan and Karimun. Commercial ferry services are available for booking with SCC's subsidiary SCC Travel Services which operates wowgetaways.com portal\nInfrastructure.\nAirports.\nSingapore aims to be Asia's aviation hub chiefly via the promotion of liberal aviation policies in a bid to encourage airlines to commence and maintain operations there. The aviation industry is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, a statutory board of the Singapore government under the Ministry of Transport.\nAn open skies agreement was concluded with the United Kingdom in October 2007 permitting unrestricted services from Singapore by UK carriers. Singapore carriers were allowed to operate domestic UK services as well as services beyond London Heathrow to a number of destinations, including the United States along with Canada.\nSingapore Changi Airport, with its four terminals, is one of the most important air hubs in the region. The international airport is situated at the easternmost tip of the main island, and serves 185 cities in 58 countries. With the recent opening of the third terminal, Changi is now capable of handling 64 million passengers every year.\nSeletar Airport is Singapore's first civil aviation airport and is primarily used for private aviation today. The airport also serves limited scheduled commercial flights by Berjaya Air to the Malaysian islands of Tioman Island and Redang Island.\nPorts and harbours.\nThere are boats and ferry services to nearby islands of Malaysia and Indonesia. These services can be found at Changi Ferry Terminal, Changi Point Ferry Terminal, Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, Singapore Cruise Centre and Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore.\nThe Port of Singapore, run by the port operators PSA International (formerly the Port of Singapore Authority) and Jurong Port, is the world's busiest in terms of shipping tonnage handled 1.04 billion gross tons were handled in the year 2004, crossing the one billion mark for the first time in Singapore's maritime history. Singapore also emerged as the top port in terms of cargo tonnage handled with 393 million tonnes of cargo in the same year, beating the Port of Rotterdam for the first time in the process. In 2006, it handled a total of 448 million tonnes of cargo.\nSingapore is ranked second globally in terms of containerised traffic, with 21.3 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) handled in 2004, and is also the world's busiest hub for transshipment traffic. Additionally, Singapore is the world's largest bunkering hub, with 23.6 million tonnes sold in 2004.\nIn 2007, the Port of Singapore was ranked the world's busiest port, surpassing Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Port of Singapore is also ranked the Best Seaport in Asia.\nRailways.\nMalaysian Railway.\nThe international railway line to Malaysia is an extension of the Malaysian rail network operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (Malayan Railways). Since 1 July 2011, Woodlands Train Checkpoint serves as the southern terminus of the KTM rail network. Previously, KTM trains terminated at Tanjong Pagar railway station in central Singapore. Two more rail links are being planned: the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail terminating in Jurong East, and the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System between Woodlands North and Bukit Chagar, Johor Bahru.\nMRT lines.\nMRT trains run through tunnels and viaducts along the following lines:\nLRT lines.\nLRT trains run on viaducts along the following lines:\nCauseway and link bridge.\nSingapore has two land links to Malaysia. The Johor-Singapore Causeway, built in the 1920s to connect Johor Bahru in Johor, Malaysia to Woodlands in Singapore, carries a road and a railway line. The Tuas Second Link, a bridge further west, was completed in 1996 and links Tuas in Singapore to Tanjung Kupang in Johor.\nRoads and expressways.\nSingapore pioneered the modern use of toll roads to enter the most congested city centre area with the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme, which has since been replaced with the Electronic Road Pricing, a form of electronic toll collection.\nTraffic drives on the left which is typical in Commonwealth countries.\nThe influence of expressways on Singapore's transport policy developed shortly after independence during the history of Singapore because of frequent traffic congestion in the Central district. The aim was to encourage residential development in other parts of the island and give residents in these new \"satellite towns\" a convenient link between their homes and their workplaces (which were mostly situated around the city centre.)"}

His siblings were Inge Scholl, Elizabeth Scholl, Sophie Scholl, and Werner Scholl. The family moved Forchtenberg in 1929. When Hitler came into power, Hans and his siblings joined the Hitler Youth against the wishes of his parents, who were devout Christians and did not approve of the course Hitler was taking with the formerly illustrious country. \nthe turning point came for Hans when he was the flag bearer for a Hitler youth rally. This was a great honor, but when Hans came back from the rally, instead of being elated and happy, he came home depressed. He later explained that he had seen that freedom of expression wasn\u2019t allowed or accepted in Hitler\u2019s Germany. Instead, public conformity was the law. Whether or not this caused him to begin to innerly revolt against Hitler, he was even more inspired to revolt in 1937 when he was captured for being part of an illicit anti nazi christian group known as d.j.1.11. He was held in prison for six weeks. At his trial, he was accused of being part of the Christian Youth Group and also of having a homosexual relationship. he was set free for both offenses, but this persecution left a lasting impact on him. \nAfter graduation from the high school he did work service in G\u00f6ppingen. In November he began to military service in Bad Cannstatt. In 1938 after ending military training Hans began studying medicine placement. In May 1940 he was a paramedic in France. In 1942, Hans, along with his good friend Alexander Schmorell, started an Anti-Nazi resistance group. Calling themselves The White Rose (and later, The Resistance Movement in Germany), the two young men wrote leaflets denouncing the state of Nazi Germany and calling for passive resistance. They then mailed the leaflets to officials and intellectuals around Munich. The first four leaflets were written from June 1942-July 1942. In July 1942, Hans and Alexander (as well as their good friend Willi Graf) received notice that they were being deployed to Russia for a three month stint as medics. They left Munich on July 23, 1942. During there three months there, the young men saw horrifying things, including the Warsaw Ghetto. What they saw inspired them to step up their leaflet game. When they returned to Munich, Hans and Alexander, as well as Willi Graf, Christoph Probst, and Sophie Scholl, began to step up their efforts. They were soon joined by Sophie\u2019s philosophy teacher Kurt Huber. Together, these six individuals made up the core of the White Rose Resistance. In January 1943, the fifth leaflet was released. While the other pamphlets had only about a hundred distributed, about 10,000 copies were made of the fifth leaflet, which was distributed all around Germany by the members, who braved trains swarming with Gestapo to post their letters from different places in Germany. \nOn February 8, inspired by a student protest against Hitler, Hans, Willi and Alexander went out in the middle of the night to graffiti Munich with slogans such as \u201cDown with Hitler,\u201d \u201cHitler the mass murderer\u201d, and \u201cFreedom!\u201d They repeated these graffiti campaigns on February 13 and February 15. \nOn February 9, Kurt Huber gave Hans his draft for the sixth pamphlet. Hans agreed with most of the pamphlet, but decided to remove a section against Huner\u2019s wishes. This infuriated Huber, who left the encounter angry and upset. He never saw Hans again.\nOn February 17, burdened with a surplus of 1,000+ leaflets and no envelopes, Hans suggested his most daring idea yet: that they drop leaflets in the halls of the Ludwig Maximilian University. Willi and Alexander declined, saying it was to risky, but Sophie went along. On the morning of February 18, Hans and Sophie snuck into the University while classes were going. Spreading leaflets in the halls, they began to leave the university when Sophie realized she still had more leaflets in her briefcase. Hurrying up to the top floor of the University, they began to distribute the remaining leaflets. They were still up there when the bell signaling the end of classes rang. Panicked, Sophie grabbed the last stack of flyers and threw them over the balcony and into the open atrium. This action was noticed by Jakob Schmid, who was a custodian working in the atrium as the papers fell. Schmid, who was also a Nazi Party Member, locked the exit doors and alerted the Gestapo, who came and arrested Sophie and Hans. For four days Hans was interrogated. At first he denied everything, but when he realized that denying was pointless he changed his story, taking all of the blame in order to protect the other members who hadn\u2019t been captured yet. Unfortunately, Hans had had a leaflet draft written by Christoph on his person when he was arrested. Christoph, who had bowed off the group due to being married with three children, was captured on February 20. On February 22, Hans, Sophie and Christoph were tried by Roland Freisler, a hard judge known as the \u201changing judge\u201d for sentencing up to 90% of the accused to death. The verdict was as expected as it was sad: death by guillotine. Hans and the others were hustled off to prison, where they learned the shocking news that the execution was to take place that same day. Hans and Sophie were able to see their parents before they died.\nat around 5 pm, the guards came for Sophie, who was the first to be executed. A few minutes later, the guards came back for Hans. As the ax fell he yelled, \u201cEs leibe die Freiheit!\u201d (Let freedom live!)\ntoday, the White Rose group, and particularly the Scholl siblings, are commonly know in Germany.

The genus has been used under many different spelling variants, although only one, \"Poekilopleuron\", is valid.

Few material is currently known, as the holotype was destroyed in World War II, although many casts of the material still exist.\nDiscovery and naming.\n\"Poekilopleuron\" is a genus of theropod with a long and complex history. The genus was first named and described by Jacques-Amand Eudes-Deslongchamps in a report published in 1836, based on holotype material that is now destroyed. In 1837, Eudes-Deslongchamps published a more detailed account of this discovery in a monograph which was also inserted next year in volume 6 of the \"M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Linn\u00e9enne Normandie\".\nThe holotype, which was housed in Mus\u00e9e de la Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de Caen and destroyed during World War II, included gastralia, phalanges, a left forelimb, caudal vertebrae, chevrons, ribs and a hindlimb. Of all the material, few is still preserved, although the gastralia, phalanges and forelimb were casted.\nIn the same 1836 publication, Eudes-Deslongchamps also named the type species of \"Poekilopleuron\", \"P. bucklandii\". Eudes-Deslongchapms noted similarities with some material of \"Megalosaurus bucklandii\" and \"Poekilopleuron\", and chose the species name \"bucklandii\" for \"Poekilopleuron\", so that it the two genera were synonymized, only the genus name would be suppressed. The generic name is derived from Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \"poikilos\", \"varied\", and \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd, \"pleuron\", \"rib\", a reference to the three types of rib present.

Sivana is tempted by sin and the Wizard tells him he will never be good enough. Shazam then sends him back to the world to the very moment that he left. Sivana panics and his father accidentally crashes his car and permanently breaks his legs. Sivana's brother blames him for what happened and hates him ever since. Sivana later becomes a doctor and pays for an experiment to reverse engineer what happened to him that way he could enter Shazam's world and fight Shazam. Dr Sivana then strikes a deal with the Seven Deadly Sins to become a supervillain in exchange for power. Dr. Sivana then kills his father and brother. Billy Batson is taken in by a new family after having repeatedly run away from foster homes to try to find his mother who was accidentally separated from him at a carnival when he was a young child. Billy meets his new foster brother Freddie who knows everything there is to know about superheroes and who walks with a crutch. Billy finds Freddie annoying. He then sees two bullies beat Freddie up with his crutch and does nothing until they make fun of Freddie for not having a mother. Billy then attacks and beats Freddie's bullies. Billy then runs away and gets onto a train. The wizard Shazam then appears to Billy and tells him that he is worthy of his power. The wizard tells him to say the name Shazam and transform into a superhero with his powers. Billy says Shazam and transforms into an adult superhero.

Billy becomes arrogant because of his power and so he chooses not to transform into his superhero form and visit Freddie as his hero at the school\u2019s next lunch like Freddie had said he would. When no superhero showed up, they gave Freddie a suitcase wedgie. Freddie then came to Billy while Billy was in his superhero form during a public appearance and tells him he only cares about himself. Dr. Sivana then comes and attacks Billy. Billy tries and fails to fight Dr.Sivana and he transforms back into a teenager by saying Shazam so that he can escape. Dr. Sivana attacks Freddie and threatens to kill him if he doesn\u2019t tell him where Billy lives. Freddie tells him. Dr. Sivana then kidnaps Billy\u2019s foster family to get Billy to come to their rescue. Billy strikes a deal with Dr.Sivana to give up his powers in exchange for his foster family but instead of giving Dr. Sivana his power he gives his powers to his family by having them say Shazam. Dr.Sivana has six of the Seven Deadly Sins try to fight against Billy and his family but they are defeated. Billy then manages to trick the Sin of Envy to leave Dr. Sivana and fight Billy himself. After Billy wins Dr. Sivana is left without power and is captured and imprisoned. Billy in his superhero form then visits Freddie at his cafeteria lunch and brings Superman with him.

In the game, players can earn \"badges\", each of which correspond to common techniques used in the production of fake news, such as polarization, conspiracy theories, discrediting, trolling, and invoking emotion. The goal is to build your own fake news empire and gain as many followers as possible while maintaining credibility.

It happened as the two large continents Africa and India (plus a smaller plates) moved north and collided with Eurasia. This happened at the end of the Mesozoic era, and is slowly continuing today.\nSo this slow collision sqeezed the Eurasian plates, and caused mountains to build from the western edge far into Asia. These are the mountain ranges of the Alpide belt. They include (from west to east) the Atlas, the Rif, the Baetic Cordillera, the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Apennine Mountains, the Dinaric Alps, the Hellenides, the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkan Mountains, the Taurus, the Armenian Highlands, the Caucasus, the Alborz, the Zagros, the Hindu Kush, the Pamir, the Karakoram, and the Himalayas.\nThe Alpine orogeny also led to more distant and smaller geological features such as the chalk hills in southern England and northern France (the 'Weald\u2013Artois Anticline'). The remains of this can be seen in the chalk ridges of the North and South Downs in southern England. Its effects are visible on the Isle of Wight, where the chalk and overlying Eocene strata are folded to near-vertical, as seen at Alum Bay and Whitecliff Bay, and on the Dorset coast near Lulworth Cove.\nThe Alpine orogeny was the last of the three major phases of orogeny in Europe that made its geology. The Caledonian orogeny which formed the Old Red Sandstone continent was the first. The second was the Variscan orogeny. That was when Pangaea formed as Gondwana and the Old Red Sandstone continent collided in the middle to late Palaeozoic."}

During its early years, the publishing company Psygnosis backed DMA Design, and it focused mainly on making games for the Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64 game systems. During this time, DMA created successful shooters such as \"Menace\" and \"Blood Money\", but it soon turned to platform games after the release of \"Lemmings\" in 1991. \"Lemmings\" was an international success and led to several sequels and spin-offs. After developing \"Unirally\" for Nintendo, DMA Design was set to become one of their main second-party developers, but this partnership ended after Nintendo's disapproval of \"Body Harvest\"."}
