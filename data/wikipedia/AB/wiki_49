The target of the missions was the 60 megawatt Vemork power station. This power station produced a type of water that is named heavy water. Heavy water is based on a hydrogen isotope called deuterium. The missions were to stop Germany from making heavy water. Germany needed the heavy water to understand and help make an atomic bombs. The attacks started in February 1942 by Norwegian Commandos and Allied bombers. The missions were code named Grouse, Freshman, and Gunnerside. The missions were successful and the Vemork power plant was no longer working by 1943.\nMissions.\nOperation Grouse.\nBritish Special Operations Executive (or SOE) made plans to put four Norwegian commandos in the area in October 1942. On 19 October 1942, these Norwegian commandos parachuted in. They had to ski a very long way to get to the station. They were supposed to watch the power station to make sure it was safe for other troops to arrive. The mission went well and the commandos began surveillance of the power station from Hardanger Plateau.\nOperation Freshman.\nOn 19 November 1942, British paratroopers were supposed to meet the Norwegian commandos and attack the power station. The paratroopers were flown in on gliders pulled by large bombers. The gliders and bombers crashed before they got to Vemork. Most of the British paratroopers were killed in the crash. One crew from a bomber survived, but they were all captured by the German army. The German Gestapo then tortured and executed all of the prisoners. Even though the Norwegian commandos were able to hide from the Germans, the mission was a complete failure.\nOperation Gunnerside.\nA new mission was started in February 1943. This time, the Norwegian commandos were able to sneak up to the power station and attacked it. The commandos set bombs on the machines that made the heavy water. The commandos left a Thompson submachine gun behind on purpose so the German military would know it wasn't people from the town. The bombs destroyed the machines and stopped the station from making heavy water. No one from the ferry survived and the heavy water was lost. All of the commandos survived.\nSinking of the \"SF Hydro\".\nAfter the station was damaged, the German soldiers tried to move the heavy water they had made. The German army moved the remaining heavy water to a dock on Lake Tinn. The heavy water was in drums that were loaded on a railroad car. They loaded the railroad cars on a ferry called the \"SF Hydro\". Norwegian resistance fighters, led by one of the commandos from Operation Gunnerside, were able to plant bombs on the ferry. After the ferry left the dock, the bombs exploded and the ferry sank into deep water. 18 people died on the ferry, 14 Norwegian people and 4 German soldiers."}

Paul wanted the new believers and their churches to be accepted by the original church in Jerusalem and to be known in faith and fellowship as true churches. After discussion, Peter concluded that the churches and their faith should be recognized as being on equal with the believer in Jerusalem. James concluded the same and the church issued a letter affirming the same faith in both sets of churches. The letter is found in the book of Acts 15:23-29. The affirmation was to accept their biblical faith, as reported by Paul and Barnabas, and to ask them to not offend their brothers in Jerusalem.\nIn the history of Christianity in the West (Roman empire) there were seven ecumenical councils include the following: the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the First Council of Constantinople in 381, the Council of Ephesus in 431, the Council of Chalcedon in 451.

Polymorphism can be found in any crystalline material including polymers, minerals, and metals. It is related to allotropy, which refers to chemical elements. The complete morphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such as crystal habit, amorphous fraction or crystallographic defects. Polymorphism is important in fields such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, pigments, dyes, foods, and explosives.\nPolimorphism that exists because of a difference in crystal packing is called packing polymorphism. Polymorphism can also result from the existence of different conformers of the same molecule in conformational polymorphism. In pseudopolymorphism the different crystal types are the result of hydration or solvation. This is more correctly referred to as solvomorphism as different solvates have different chemical formulas. An example of an organic polymorph is glycine, which is able to form monoclinic and hexagonal crystals. Silica is known to form many polymorphs, the most important of which are; \u03b1-quartz, \u03b2-quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, moganite, coesite, and stishovite. A classical example is the pair of minerals, calcite and aragonite, both forms of calcium carbonate.\nAn analogous phenomenon for amorphous materials is polyamorphism, when a substance can take on several different amorphous modifications."}

The existence of God(s) is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant.\nScientist and philosopher Ian von Hegner has argued that apatheism is an alternative to positions such as theism, atheism, and agnosticism, with implications that have been overlooked in modern philosophical discussions. Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism \"uncharted territory in the philosophy of religion.\""}

These numbers can be categorized into two types: transfinite cardinals and transfinite ordinals.\nTransfinite cardinals are infinite numbers used to quantify the different sizes of infinity\u2014of which there are many kinds. For example, the number formula_1 (aleph null) is used to refer to the size of the set of natural numbers (or other sets having the same size as the natural numbers). Other such numbers include formula_2 (aleph one) and formula_3. These are called aleph numbers.\nUnder continuum hypothesis, the number formula_2 is the same as the size of the set of real numbers. This number is sometimes referred to as formula_5 (or the cardinality of the continuum).\nAside from transfinite cardinals, transfinite ordinals also exist. These are numbers used to describe the ordering of sets. For example, the ordinal number formula_6 is the set of all finite ordinals. It is also the first transfinite ordinal."}

These forces were led by Oliver Cromwell. The event is known as Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or Cromwellian war in Ireland. Cromwell invaded Ireland with his New Model Army on behalf of England's Rump Parliament in August 1649.\nAfter the Irish Rebellion of 1641, most of Ireland came under the control of the Irish Catholic Confederation. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English Royalists, who had been defeated by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, ending the Irish Confederate Wars (or Eleven Years' War). However, guerrilla warfare continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of Penal Laws against Roman Catholics (the vast majority of the population) and confiscated large amounts of their land.\nThe Parliamentarian conquest was brutal, and Cromwell is still a hated figure in Ireland. The extent to which Cromwell, who was in direct command for the first year of the campaign, was responsible for the atrocities is debated to this day. Some historians argue that the actions of Cromwell were within the then-accepted rules of war, or were exaggerated or distorted by later propagandists; these claims have been challenged by others.\nThe impact of the war on the Irish population was unquestionably severe, although there is no consensus as to the magnitude of the loss of life. The war resulted in famine, which was worsened by an outbreak of bubonic plague. Estimates of the drop in the Irish population resulting from the Parliamentarian campaign range from 15 to 41 percent. The Parliamentarians also transported about 50,000 people as indentured labourers. Some estimates cover population losses over the course of the Conquest Period (1649\u201352) only, while others cover the period of the Conquest to 1653 and the period of the Cromwellian Settlement from August 1652 to 1659 together."}

It was centered in the city of Axum and grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC. It became important by the 1st century AD. \nAksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India. The Aksumite rulers made trade easier by minting their own Aksumite currency. The state also assumed its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush. It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. The Manichaei prophet Mani (died 274 AD) regarded Axum as one of the four great powers of his time; the others were Persia, Rome, and China. \nThe Aksumites built monumental stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, at 90 feet. Under Ezana (fl. 320\u2013360) Aksum adopted Christianity. In the 7th century, early Muslims from Mecca sought refuge from Quraysh persecution by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in Islamic history as the First Hijra.\nThe kingdom's ancient capital, also called Axum, is now a town in Tigray Region (northern Ethiopia). The Kingdom used the name \"Ethiopia\" as early as the 4th century. Tradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the Queen of Sheba."}

The wood is obtained from pear tree, walnut tree or beech tree. The moulds have many different shapes. These includes animals, floral patterns, people or landscapes. \nThe biscuit is cooked in an oven preheated to around for 15 minutes. This allows the honey to caramelize. On cooling, the biscuit becomes very hard. It can be preserved indefinitely. \"Couques\" can be displayed as decoration as they will not rot. They are used as as Christmas tree ornaments, or used to commemorate special occasions.\nA different type, the couque de Rins also adds sugar to the dough. It is sweeter and softer as a result.\nConsumption.\n\"Couques de Dinant\" cannot be bitten as they are very large and hard. They are instead broken into small pieces. The pieces can then be bitten, sucked, left to melt in the mouth or be soaked in coffee. \"Couques de Dinant\" have been traditionally given to babies during teething.\nDinant bakeries see large sales over the summer season due to tourists. The consumption of \"couques\" is highest near Saint Nicholas Day in December. At that time of year, they are sold and eaten all over Belgium.\nOrigins.\nA popular but unlikely legend said that couques came from from the sacking of Dinant in 1466. Dinant was sacked by Charles the Bold during the Li\u00e8ge Wars. The citizens were supposedly desperate and had little to eat but flour and honey. They then decided to make a dough by mixing honey and flour. As the dough was so hard, they find that ornaments can be made out of it. One example is \"dinanderie\" (local ornamental brasswork). The people thereby began the tradition of giving the biscults patterns.\nIt is more clear that \"couque\" began to appear some time in the 18th century. The exact circumstances of its invention are unclear though."}

This image is false, and largely relies on ignorance. These groups are not technophobic, they simply judge the technologies they use: if the technology is useful for the group as a whole, and it does not pose a risk in making the group fall apart, the technology is usually kept. As an example, tractors are used, because they help with agriculture. Cars, on the other hand, are often not used, because they help drive the community apart.\nOccurrence.\nIn a study, done between 1992 and 1994 University students in different countries were asked if they were technophobic: Among the 3.392 participants in the United States, 29% identified as strongly technophobic.

It lies within the barony of Gaultier (\"G\u00e1ll T\u00edr\" \u2013 \"foreigners' land\" in Irish): \nHistory.\nIron Age people established a promontory fort overlooking the sea at Shanooan (referred to in 1832 as meaning the 'Old Camp' but more likely Canon Power's Sean Uaimh, 'Old Cave') \nIn 1640, Lord Power of Curraghmore, who owned a large amount of property in the area, built a castle on the cliff overlooking the strand about two hundred metres from St. Andrew's Church. The castle was falling into ruin by the middle of the next century and now just one tower remains.\nIn Smith's history of Waterford, the village was mentioned as being a fishing port about the year 1745. The fishermen's homes were in the Lower Village near the Strand Inn and boats were launched from the slip at Lawlor's Beach before the harbour was built. There is mention of a fleet of fifty fishing boats working from Dunmore East in 1776.\nIn 1812 a decision was made at Westminster, London to create an entirely new landing point for passengers and mails coming to Ireland from London and southern England. The place selected was Dunmore East and \u00a3118,000 was set aside for the erection of a pier there. In 1814 big changes took place when Alexander Nimmo commenced work on the new harbour at Dunmore. The work mainly the building of a large pier or quay with a lighthouse at the end. Nimmo's original estimate had been \u00a320,000 but at the time of his death in 1832 about \u00a393,000 had been spent and the final cost was \u00a3108,000. By then (1837) the harbour had started to silt up, so the packet station was transferred to Waterford city.\nThe sheltered harbour meant that Dunmore East became an important fishing port. It also then developed into a very popular tourist resort and it is now a favourite port of call for large cruise liners visiting the south-east of Ireland.\nThe Haven Hotel, formerly the Villa Marina, was a holiday home built by the Malcolmsons, who were involved financially in the American Civil War. The Fisherman's Hall in the village was also built by the family for fishermen to mend their nets.\nSport.\nDunmore East is home to many sporting clubs from sailing to Gaelic Football. Gaultier GAA which focuses primarily on Gaelic Football is located just outside the village, across the road from Dunmore FC soccer club. Gaultier were founded in 1927 and compete in the Waterford Senior Football Championship as well as catering for over 100 juvenile members. Dunmore FC were founded in the 1970s initially before being re-established in the early to mid 2000s. The sailing club was founded in 1934.\nHarbour.\nThe harbour is one of the five designated National Fishery Harbours and has the second-highest figure for fish landings after Killybegs. In the summer months, it is popular with visiting yachts which have a designated pontoon. A plan was developed in 2005 by Waterford County Council to expand the harbour to accommodate more recreational marine activities. However, that plan appears to have been shelved due to lack of funding.\nTourism.\nThe village is home to the Waterford Harbour Sailing Club with dinghy and keelboat sailing and the Dunmore East Adventure Centre. The local golf course is on the clifftop overlooking the bay.\nSea angling and Diving is catered for by Dunmore East Angling Charters.\nDunmore East is home to several seafood restaurants, and there are two principal hotels in Dunmore: The Strand Inn and The Haven. The Haven was the summer home of the Malcomson family of Portlaw who were wealthy millers and shipbuilders. \nThere is also a caravan site catering for motorhomes and touring caravans.\nAmong the events held in Dunmore East is the annual bluegrass festival which takes place at the end of August. During this festival the village hosts a number of bluegrass groups over the weekend during which almost every bar becomes a music venue from 3pm until late in the evening.\nTwin town.\nDunmore East is twinned with the village of Clohars-Carno\u00ebt in France.\nTransport.\nThere is a good road connection to Waterford City. Suirway operate a bus route linking Dunmore East to Waterford."}

One is usually located above a steep cliff, often only connected to the mainland by a small neck of land. Most seem to date to the Iron Age. They are mainly found in Brittany, Ireland, the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, Devon and Cornwall.\nIreland.\nOnly a few Irish promontory forts have been excavated and most date to the Iron Age, though some, like Dunbeg (County Kerry) might have originated in the Bronze Age. Others, like Dalkey Island (County Dublin) contain imported Eastern Mediterranean pottery and have been reoccupied and changed in the early medieval period. \nIsle of Man.\nOn the Isle of Man promontory forts are found particularly on the rocky slate headlands of the south. Four out of more than 20 have been excavated and several, especially in Santon, can be visited using the Raad ny Foillan coastal footpath. All have a rampart on their vulnerable landward side, and excavations at Cronk ny Merriu have shown that access to the fort was via a strongly built gate.\nThe Scandinavians who arrived in the Isle of Man in the eighth and ninth centuries AD sometimes re-used these Iron Age promontory forts.\nDevon &amp; Cornwall.\nPromontory forts can be found all along the coast of Penwith. Maen Castle, near to Land's End is one of the oldest, having been dated to around 500 BC. They are also found in other districts, e.g. The Rumps near Padstow and Dodman Point on the southern Cornish coast as well as Rame Head close to Plymouth. In Devon, Burgh Island and Bolt Tail are located on the south coast and Embury Beacon and Hillsborough on the north coast.\nThe famous site at Tintagel may be a rare example of promontory fort whose occupation continued after the Romans and from there into later periods.\nBrittany.\nCaesar's \"de Bello Gallico\" describes the Veneti in southern Armorica \u2013 a powerful sea-faring people allied with the southern British during the war of 56 BC \u2013 as living in clifftop oppida. Their capital was \"Darioritum\" on the Morbihan bay, now modern Vannes/Gwened. The Veneti were linguistically British: they spoke Breton, which was derived from Cornish, and they once ruled Cornwall and Devon. They had close trade ties.

This is called the greenhouse effect because a greenhouse stops some of the sun's heat from escaping, and these gases stop some heat escaping from Earth. The greenhouse gas which makes the most warming is carbon dioxide (short name CO2), and burning coal is the biggest thing which puts it in the atmosphere. Climate sensitivity means how much the Earth will warm when a certain amount of CO2 is released into the atmosphere. Usually it means how much warmer the Earth would be if the atmosphere had twice as much CO2 as the year 1750, before people started burning lots of coal. Scientists think that when CO2 in the atmosphere doubles an extra 4 joules of heat gets trapped every second on every square metre on Earth, and that after a long time the Earth will be about 3\u00a0\u00b0C hotter.\nHow sensitive is the climate?\nClimate scientists don't know the climate sensitivity very well but they think it is probably between 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 4.5\u00a0\u00b0C. So if the atmosphere had twice as much CO2 as it had in 1750 then Earth would likely be between 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 4.5\u00a0\u00b0C warmer, after thousands of years.\nHow do we know?\nThere are three ways to try to find out the climate sensitivity. The first way is to look at the temperature measurements made each year since 1750 and compare them with measurements of how much greenhouse gas was in the atmosphere at the same time. The second way is to try and work out how much greenhouse gas there was and what the temperature was in the distant past before people started measuring them. For example by measuring how much CO2 is in tiny bubbles of air trapped deep in ice sheets thousands of years ago. The third way is to make models of the climate system in computers.\nWhy is it important to know better how sensitive the climate is?\nThe Paris Agreement is to keep global warming below 2\u00a0\u00b0C. If the climate is very sensitive this will be very difficult, so maybe people and countries should change to using cleaner energy more quickly. But if the climate is not very sensitive perhaps it would be a waste of money to stop using the coal burning power stations which are still almost new. So it is very important to find out more exactly what the climate sensitivity is.\nWhy is it difficult to find out?\nIt is difficult to find out how sensitive the climate is, because after the greenhouse effect makes the Earth a little bit warmer there are a lot of different kinds of feedbacks, which can make the warming faster or slower. For example the warmth evaporates more water from the sea, and this water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, which makes the Earth even warmer. Scientists are fairly sure that most feedback makes the warming faster: but because the feedback is so complicated they don't understand very well, and sometimes their computers are not fast enough to do enough calculations to get a good answer. The project where they work together to understand better is called the Coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP). One of the things they are trying to understand better is clouds, because they might make a big difference.\nDifferent ways to talk about climate sensitivity.\nPeople who are thinking about the 21st century might talk about climate sensitivity differently to people who are thinking about thousands of years in the future.\nWhen the CO2 stops increasing.\nIf the CO2 increases gradually by 1% each year the \"transient climate response\" (TCR) is the increase in temperature by the year when it has doubled. This is likely between 1\u00a0\u00b0C and 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C. Because this is a bit like what might happen this century this might be the most useful way for most people to talk about climate sensitivity when they are talking about the Paris Agreement.\nWhen the temperature of the ocean balances the temperature of the atmosphere.\nBut most of the extra heat warms up the oceans, and after the CO2 has stopped increasing some of this heat leaves the oceans and keeps on slowly warming up the atmosphere for thousands of years. The \"equilibrium climate sensitivity\" (ECS) is the temperature the Earth would get to once the atmosphere had got back in balance with the oceans, if the CO2 stopped increasing but stayed at the double level."}

It\u2019s temperature is 51,000 oK.\nThe extreme luminosity is by the CNO process. It is 230 times the mass of the Sun and 5,623,000 times more luminous. \nThe star is losing mass by stellar winds. It is strongly suspected to be a binary system, due to the hard x-ray emission of colliding wind binaries. However, the companion makes only a small part of the luminosity.\nR136c is likely to end in a supernova, a hypernova, or a gamma ray burst, or no visible explosion at all and become a black hole. The fate of R136c depends on it\u2019s mass loss. The future of R136c is uncertain. It might become or just skip the LBV stage and become a hydrogen free (WNE or WNL)star. Lastly, it will be a wolf rayet star that is fusing oxygen (WO). Then, it will most likely to explode in a supernova. Its remnant would be most likely a black hole.\nIt is a very young, highly luminous object. R136c can be seen on the lower left to the center of the R136 cluster.

In 1902, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Hendrik Lorentz for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect.\nChildhood and youth.\nPieter Zeeman was born in Zonnemaire, a small town on the island of Schouwen-Duiveland, Netherlands. He was the son of Rev Catharinus Forandinus Zeeman, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Willemina Worst.\nPieter was interested in physics at an early age. In 1883, the aurora borealis could be seen in the Netherlands. Zeeman, still a high school student, made a drawing and description of the aurora. He sent it to Nature, where it was published. The editor praised \"the careful observations of Professor Zeeman from his observatory in Zonnemaire\".\nAfter finishing high school in 1883, Zeeman went to Delft. He studied classical languages, which he needed for admission to University. He stayed with Dr J. W. Lely, co-principal of the gymnasium. Lely was the brother of Cornelis Lely, who was responsible for the idea and building of the Zuiderzee Works. In Delft, he met Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who was to become his thesis adviser.\nEducation and early career.\nZeeman studied physics at the University of Leiden under Kamerlingh Onnes and Hendrik Lorentz. In 1890, even before finishing his thesis, he became Lorentz's assistant. This allowed him to take part in research on the Kerr effect. In 1893 he submitted his doctoral thesis on the Kerr effect, the reflection of polarized light on a magnetized surface. He then went for six months to Friedrich Kohlrausch's institute in Strasbourg. In 1895, Zeeman came back from Strasbourg to teach mathematics and physics in Leiden. He married Johanna Elisabeth Lebret (1873\u20131962); they had three daughters and one son.\nIn 1896, shortly before moving from Leiden to Amsterdam, he measured the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field. This research looked at what effect magnetic fields would have on a light source. He discovered that the spectral line is split into several parts in the by the magnetic field. Kamerlingh Onnes told Lorentz about Zeeman's observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam. The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman into his office and presented him with an explanation, based on Lorentz's theory of electromagnetic radiation. Zeeman's discovery is now known as the Zeeman effect. \nThe discovery was important. It proved Lorentz's theory about the polarization of light emitted in the presence of a magnetic field. It showed that the oscillating particles, the source of the light, were negatively charged, and were a thousandfold lighter than the hydrogen atom. This was well before Thomson's discovery of the electron. The Zeeman effect became an important tool for understanding the structure of the atom.\nProfessor in Amsterdam.\nShortly after his discovery, Zeeman was offered a position as lecturer in Amsterdam. In 1900 he became professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam. In 1902, together with Lorentz, he received the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of the Zeeman effect. Five years later, in 1908, he succeeded Van der Waals as full professor and Director of the Physics Institute in Amsterdam.\nA new laboratory built in 1923 allowed Zeeman to continue to study the Zeeman effect. The laboratory was renamed the Zeeman Laboratory in 1940. For the remainder of his career he remained interested in research in Magneto-Optics. He also studied the propagation of light in moving media. This became important because of study into special relativity, and enjoyed keen interest from Lorentz and Einstein. Later in his career he became interested in mass spectrometry.\nZeeman died on 9 October 1943 in Amsterdam, and was buried in Haarlem."}

Because it is easy to do, it is usually taught in schools. There are other methods which are faster, or easier to program with a computer, but they are more difficult to understand and perform manually. If we have a large or complicated division problem, we can use long division to break it down into a series of easier calculations. Long division can also be done on polynomials as well.\nOverview.\nAs with most division problems we have three numbers: the dividend, our first number; the divisor, the second number we divide it by; and the quotient, which is the result. Long division is a kind of algorithm, which means it helps us to find the solution to a problem by following a set of clearly-defined steps:\nExamples.\nBasic case.\nLet's assume we want to divide 780 by 4. To do so with long division, we need to split 780 into digits -- 7 and 8 and 0 -- and then divide each one by 4, carrying any remainders to the next step.\n7 / 4 = 1 R 3 -- since we have a remainder of 3, we have to carry this down.\n38 / 4 = 9 R 2 -- we carry our remainder of 2 down.\n20 / 4 = 5 R 0 -- we have reached the end.\nBy using long division, we have found that 780 / 4 = 195.\nComplex case.\nLet's perform a similar calculation where our numbers do not divide easily: 468 / 12\n4 / 12 = 0 R 0 -- we cannot perform this division as 4&lt;12, so we have to carry our dividend like a remainder.\n46 / 12 = 3 R 10 -- we carry our remainder of 10 down.\n108 / 12 = 9 R 0 -- we have reached the end.\nBy the same process we have found that 468 / 12 = 39.\nDecimal Answers.\nLet's follow the same process for numbers that give an answer with a decimal because they don't have common factors: 123 / 8\n1 / 8 = 0 R 0 -- we cannot perform this division as 1&lt;8, so we have to carry our dividend like a remainder.\n12 / 8 = 1 R 4 -- we carry our remainder of 4 down.\n43 / 8 = 5 R 3 -- we have reached the end with a remainder, which we have to add to our final answer.\n123 / 8 = 15 R 3, which equals 15.375 (15 3/8)."}

He won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905 for his work on cathode rays. His most important work was his study of the photoelectric effect. He discovered that the energy (speed) of the electrons from a cathode depends on the wavelength, not the intensity of the light.\nLenard was a nationalist and anti-Semite. He was a supporter of Adolf Hitler in the 1920s. He was a role model for the \"Deutsche Physik\" movement during the Nazi period. He said that Albert Einstein's contributions to science were \"Jewish physics\".\nEarly life and work.\nPhilipp Lenard was born in Pressburg (today's Bratislava), on 7 June 1862 in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Lenard family were of German-descent. His father, Philipp von Lenardis (1812\u20131896), was a wine-merchant in Pressburg. His mother was Antonie Baumann (1831\u20131865). In 1880, he studied physics and chemistry in Vienna and Budapest, going back to Pressburg in 1882. After being refused an assistant's position in the University of Budapest in 1883, he moved to Heidelberg. He studied under the Robert Bunsen, and also one semester in Berlin with Hermann von Helmholtz. He gained a doctoral degree in 1886. In 1887 he went back to Budapest to work for Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s. After working in Aachen, Bonn, Breslau, Heidelberg (1896\u20131898), and Kiel (1898\u20131907), he went back to the University of Heidelberg in 1907 as the head of the Philipp Lenard Institute. In 1905, Lenard became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1907, he became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\nHe studied phosphorescence, luminescence, and the conductivity of flames.\nContributions to physics.\nPhotoelectric investigations.\nLenard began the study of cathode rays in 1888. These rays were made in simple, partially evacuated glass tubes. Inside were metallic electrodes across which a high voltage could be placed. It was difficult to study the rays inside the sealed glass tubes. They were difficult to access, and there were still air molecules in the tubes. Lenard was able to make small metallic windows in the glass, thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure, but thin enough to let the rays pass through. He could pass the rays out into the laboratory, or into another chamber that was completely airless. These windows are now known as \"Lenard windows\". He could easily detect the rays and measure their intensity by using paper sheets with a layer of phosphorescent materials.\nLenard saw that the absorption of cathode rays was proportional to the density of the material they passed through. This was opposite to the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through the air and appeared to be scattered by it. This meant that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of J.J. Thomson's work, and this showed that cathode rays were streams of negatively charged energetic particles. He called them quanta of electricity or for short quanta, after Helmholtz. J.J. Thomson had called them corpuscles, but electrons became the everyday term. Lenard used this knowledge, together with the results of his and others' earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals. He showed that electrons were parts of the atom. Lenard worked out that atoms were mostly empty space. He said that every atom consists of empty space and electrically neutral corpuscules called \"dynamids\", each consisting of an electron and an equal positive charge.\nHe experimented using a Crookes tube. He showed that the rays produced by irradiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were like cathode rays. He found that the energy of the rays was independent of the light intensity, but was greater for shorter wavelengths of light.\nAlbert Einstein explained this as a quantum effect. This theory said that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to Planck's constant, \"h\". This was proved some years later. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this theory. Lenard did not like the attention given to Einstein. He did not believe in Einsteins theories, including relativity. However he did agree with Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect.\nLenard received the 1905 Nobel Prize for Physics in recognition of this work.\nMeteorological contributions.\nLenard was the first person to study what is now called the \"Lenard effect\" in 1892. This is the separation of electric charges related to the aerodynamic breakup of water drops. It is also known as spray electrification or the waterfall effect.\nHe studied the size and shapes of raindrops. He built a wind tunnel in which water droplets could be held still for a few seconds. He discovered that large raindrops are not tear-shaped, but are rather shaped like a hamburger bun.\n\"Deutsche Physik\".\nLenard was a strong German nationalist, and did not like \"English physics\". He thought the English had stolen their ideas from Germany. He joined the National Socialist Party before it was popular. He said that Germany should rely on \"Deutsche Physik\" and ignore what he said were the false and deliberately misleading ideas of \"Jewish physics\". By this he meant the theories of Albert Einstein, including \"the Jewish fraud\" of relativity. He became an advisor to Adolf Hitler, and the Chief of Aryan physics.\nLenard retired from Heidelberg University as professor of theoretical physics in 1931. He was removed from his honorary position by Allied occupation forces in 1945. The Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg had been named the Philipp Lenard Schule from 1927 until 1945. it was renamed in September 1945, The military government were removing Nazi street names and monuments . Lenard died in 1947 in Messelhausen, Germany."}

Torquay on the eastern shore was the largest. It had a police station, post office, magistrate, at least three hotels, shipyards and stores. A river ferry service connected the two villages. Between 1870 and 1880 the shipping industry grew and work was undertaken to deepen the mouth of the river. The first regular steamship services operated to Melbourne, Victoria. The Marine Board building (1882) is the oldest building in Devonport. \nIn 1889 the Bluff lighthouse was built, and later the railway reached Formby. A wharf was created on the west bank, close to the railway and warehouses. This began a building boom in Formby. In 1890 the public voted to join the two villages together to become the town of Devonport.\nThe Victoria bridge was opened in 1902 and linked Devonport and East Devonport.\nDevonport was proclaimed a city by Prince Charles of Wales on 21 April 1981 in a ceremony at the Devonport Oval.\nThe cross river ferry service was stopped in 2014 after 160 years of continuous service.

It is located in North-Central Mexico. It is part of the macroregion of Baj\u00edo, which is among the safest and most prosperous regions in Mexico. It was part of the kingdom of Nueva Galicia. In 1835 Aguascalientes became the capital of the Free and Sovereign State of Aguascalientes. Aguascalientes has been called the cleanest city in Latin America. Aguascalientes is experiencing an ongoing social, economic, and aesthetic revitalization process. Aguascalientes has a population which includes Japanese, Koreans, and Germans.\nIt stands on the banks of the Aguascalientes river, 1880\u00a0meters above sea level, at . It is the municipal seat for the Aguascalientes Municipality. The Aguascalientes metropolitan area includes the municipality of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda and San Francisco de los Romo. It was a Chichimeca Indian territory. It later blossomed as a strategic link between Mexico City and the mines of Zacatecas, while prosperous agriculture and ranching helped feed Spain's emerging New World cities.\nOECD has recognized Aguascalientes as having a good business climate. It is a strong business and economic center in the Baj\u00edo region. Its strategic location and infrastructure have made it a regional hub and a location for international headquarters. Also home to two of Nissan's largest and most important manufacturing plants in Latin America. Other important companies located in Aguascalientes include Jatco, Coca-Cola, Flextronics, Texas Instruments, Donaldson, and Calsonic Kansei.\nBecause of its services and hotel industry, Aguascalientes is one of the most important centers in Mexico for entertainment, gastronomy, leisure activities, arts and recreation.\nHistory.\nThe city of Aguascalientes was founded on October 22, 1575, by Juan de Montoro as a postal service rest stop between the cities of Zacatecas and Mexico City, though it is known that the site already featured a small population by the time it was granted an official status. Although its founders did not envision it becoming a major city, it became the capital of the newly formed state of the same name when its territory separated from the adjacent state of Zacatecas in 1835. When the state separated from Zacatecas, Aguascalientes raced ahead in its development, while the state of Zacatecas remained behind in comparison.\nThe historical center of Aguascalientes was born out of four distinct neighborhoods. The oldest of these is the \"Barrio del Encino\", which is technically older than Aguascalientes proper. Founded in 1565 by the Andalusian Hern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Berrocal, the neighborhood was originally named \"Triana\" after the neighborhood in Seville, Spain. The \"Barrio del Encino\" is home to the baroque-style \"Templo del Se\u00f1or del Encino\", a Catholic temple built between 1773 and 1796. The \"Cristo Negro del Encino\" (\"Black Christ of the live oak\"), is a widely venerated religious icon symbolic of this neighborhood. The colonial square and the Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada Museum, adjacent to the temple, are one of the main attractions in the city.\nThe second neighborhood is the \"Barrio de San Marcos\", which has its roots in the early 17th century as an indigenous settlement on the outskirts of the then-village of Aguascalientes. Between 1628 and 1688, some communal land was allocated to the community, but the indigenous people still worked on Spanish-owned farms and produced goods to sell in Aguascalientes. Meanwhile, they organized the construction of a simple hospital and a chapel. This original chapel was replaced by the current \"Templo de San Marcos\" completed on December 15, 1763; this church is the spiritual headquarters of the \"Feria Nacional de San Marcos\".\nThe third neighborhood is the \"Barrio de Guadalupe\", which began its development as a string of shops and trading posts alongside the road leading from Aguascalientes to Jalpa and Zacatecas during the latter half of the 18th century. The neighborhood's iconic \"Templo de Guadalupe\" was built between 1767 and 1789; it's recognized for its Spanish Baroque fa\u00e7ade and its dome lined with Talavera tiles. Especially after the founding of the \"Fundici\u00f3n Central Mexicana\" (\"Mexican Central Foundry\"), the neighborhood developed quickly; by the early 20th century its roadside inns had mostly been converted into homes and its boundaries had blurred with those of the \"Barrio de San Marcos\".\nThe final neighborhood is the \"Barrio de la Salud\", which has its roots in a small chapel and a cemetery developed towards the end of the 18th century to deal with a number of disease epidemics that had struck the area. Gravediggers established homes near the cemetery, and others took advantage of the open land to establish orchards. Though the orchards began to disappear during the early 20th century, clues as to the neighborhood's roots still remain. First of all, the fact that property lines generally followed irrigation ditches can still be seen in the neighborhood's haphazard street grids today. Second, the neighborhood's working-class character is visible in its primarily single-story homes featuring simple fa\u00e7ades.\nA fifth neighborhood, the \"Barrio de la Estaci\u00f3n\", is often grouped in with the city's original neighborhoods. However, this neighborhood is considerably more modern, with much of its development dating from the final decades of the 19th century or later. Therefore, despite its important role in the history of Aguascalientes, it's not strictly accurate to consider the \"Barrio de la Estaci\u00f3n\" one of the city's original historical neighborhoods.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Aguascalientes has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSh). Most of the precipitation is concentrated from June to September.\nEtymology.\nThe name originates from the Spanish words \"aguas calientes\", meaning \"hot waters\" although a more accurate translation is \"hot springs\", part of the original name of \"Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n de las Aguas Calientes\" (Village of our Lady of Assumption of the Hot Springs). When the city was first settled by Juan de Montoro and twelve families, it was given this name for its abundance of hot springs. These thermal features are still in demand in the city's numerous spas and even exploited for domestic use. People from Aguascalientes (both the city and the state) are known by the whimsical Spanish demonym \"hidroc\u00e1lidos\" or \"hydrothermal\" people.\nModern day.\nAguascalientes today identifies itself as at the confluence of tradition and industry. Its preserved colonial downtown testifies to its rich architectural heritage and cultural vision. On the other hand, the precisely planned peripheral expressways, as well as its first class avenues and lanes, are surrounded with industrial parks that employ thousands of people. The state reports a high index of migrants, especially from other states, seeking to acquire a better quality of life.\nDemographics.\nAs of 2010, the city of Aguascalientes proper had a population of 797,010. The two other municipalities considered parts of the Aguascalientes metropolitan area are Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda and San Francisco de los Romo; they had populations of 99,590 and 35,769, respectively. As such, the Aguascalientes metropolitan area had a total population of 932,369.\nAccording to the latest census by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Data Processing (INEGI), Aguascalientes City was the 13th largest metropolitan area by population in the country. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Mexico.\nQuality of life.\nThe city had a Human Development Index of 0.82 in 2000, placing it in the very high development category. Open heart surgeries and heart and kidney transplants have been performed in Aguascalientes for the past 20 years; by comparison, these same surgeries were first performed in the United States 28 years ago. The life expectancy of 76 years is similar to that which can be found in Denmark, Ireland or Portugal.\n100% of the population has Medical Service Coverage. In addition, two more government-controlled Medical Services exist for those who work in a job affiliated with them. There are also plenty of options in the form of private medical centers.\nEconomy.\nAccording to the World Bank, Aguascalientes has the most business friendly environment in Mexico and is one of the best places in the world to invest. 240 multinationals were installed during the last 30 years, representing the United States, Japan, Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and Brazil among others. 70% of Japan's investment in Mexico is in Aguascalientes.\n25 companies from the industry of IT &amp; Software cluster. Softtek, the largest software development company in Mexico, has large operations in Aguascalientes.\nAguascalientes is home to two large Nissan manufacturing plants, including the most important outside of Japan. Among other models of cars, they manufacture the Sentra and the Versa. The Aguascalientes plants are responsible for the majority of Mexico's overall annual production of 850,000 Nissan automobiles. Due to their presence, the city has a significant Japanese population.\nTexas Instruments has one plant in Aguascalientes, it is dedicated to integrated circuitry (IC) manufacturing. Sensata Technologies, has one plant in the city, making sensors and controls for automotive, HVAC and industrial use. Flextronics is another electronics manufacturer that has a plant located in Aguascalientes City. There are also several companies that work in the robotics industry, the most notable being FANUC Robotics.\nEducation.\nEight out of the 100 best colleges in Mexico are in Aguascalientes. There are 25 universities and colleges for only 1 million inhabitants. This ranks as first place per capita in Mexico.\nThe \"Escuela Japonesa de Aguascalientes\" (\u30a2\u30b0\u30a2\u30b9\u30ab\u30ea\u30a8\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821 \"Aguasukarientesu Nihonjin Gakk\u014d\"), an overseas Japanese school, is in Aguascalientes.\nAs of 2013, the city contains 59 primary schools and 13 junior high schools.\nTransport.\nCycling.\nAguascalientes is known as one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in Mexico. The municipality is also developing a system of interconnected green bicycle routes, greenways, the aim being to facilitate fast, safe, and pleasant bicycle transport from one end of the city to the other.\nRoads.\nAguascalientes has a large network of roads connecting different municipalities of the city together and to other cities.\nAirport.\nLic. Jes\u00fas Ter\u00e1n Peredo International Airport serves the city, with four daily non-stop international flights from Los Angeles, Dallas and Houston.\nUrban development.\nAguascalientes is a strategically planned city, having been pioneers in urban development regulation since 1936. The city is planned around three beltway loops, which is unique in Mexico. The third beltway loop will be fully operational in 2022.\nFiber optic infrastructure.\nAguascalientes has the same fiber-optic and voice/data communication infrastructure as\nMexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey.\nCulture and recreation.\nAguascalientes houses the largest festival held in Mexico, the San Marcos Fair, which takes place from the middle of April to the beginning of May. The celebration was held originally in the San Marcos church, neighborhood, and its magnificent neoclassical garden; since then, it has greatly expanded to cover a huge area of exposition spaces, bullrings, nightclubs, theaters, performance stages, theme parks, hotels, convention centers, and other attractions. It attracts almost 7 million visitors to Aguascalientes every year.\nThe old part of the city revolves around downtown and the four original neighborhoods from which the city expanded. The most notable building here is the Baroque Government Palace, dating from 1664 and constructed out of red volcanic stone; it is known for its one hundred arches. The prominent Baroque Cathedral, begun in 1575, is the oldest building in the city.

Since there are so many different pronouns for each person (first, second, and third), and so few that can be appropriately used in every situation, many people say that Japanese lacks true pronouns.\nAccording to the Japanese language blog Tofugu, Japanese has more first-person pronouns than any other language. To give examples of the complexity of Japanese pronouns, \"watashi\" could be considered the normal polite way of calling yourself if you are unsure of what to call yourself, but if you are male, you could call yourself \"boku\" or \"ore\" if you are with friends or family, but you should call yourself \"watakushi\" if you are talking to your boss or in a formal situation. If you are female, it is normal to call yourself \"watashi\" even in casual situations, although you can also call yourself \"atashi\" or \"uchi\". The most common plural first-person pronoun is \"watashi-tachi\", but in formal situations you can call yourselves \"ware-ware\" (which is also sometimes used to describe \"the people [of Japan]). This does not describe every first-person pronoun, but this explanation is written to give the reader an idea. \nSince most Japanese see the second-person (e.g. \"you\") pronoun as very intimate, second-person is usually avoided and the second-person is talked to using a third-person (e.g. \"he/she/it/they\") pronoun instead."}

Despite this, he was forgiven. Louis gave him the management of an area of south-east France known as the Dauphin\u00e9. There, Louis led his own political establishment and married Charlotte of Savoy, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. His father did not approve of the marriage and sent an army, but Louis fled to Burgundy, where he was hosted by Charles' biggest enemy Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.\nWhen Charles VII died in 1461, Louis became King of France. He earned the nicknames \"the Cunning\" (Middle French: \"le rus\u00e9\") and \"the Universal Spider\" (Middle French: \"l'universelle aragne\"), as his enemies accused him of spinning webs of plots and conspiracies.\nIn 1472, the next Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, fought against Louis in the Burgundian Wars. However, Louis was able to separate Charles from his English allies by signing the Treaty of Picquigny (1475) with Edward IV of England. The treaty officially ended the Hundred Years' War. With the death of Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the dynasty of the Dukes of Burgundy ended. Louis took advantage of the situation to seize numerous Burgundian territories, including Burgundy itself and Picardy.\nWithout direct foreign threats, Louis was able to get rid of his rebellious vassals, expand royal power, and strengthen the economic development of his country. He died on 30 August 1483, and was succeeded by his son Charles VIII."}

He was President of Burkina Faso from 1983 to 1987. He was a Marxist and pan-Africanist. His supporters viewed him as a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution. For this reason, he is sometimes called \"Africa's Che Guevara\".\nCareer.\nThere was a coup in 1983, supported by the people. A number of revolutionaries seized power for Sankara, who was under house arrest at the time. Aged 33, Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta. \nHe immediately launched programmes for social, ecological and economic change and renamed the country from the French colonial name Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (\"Land of Incorruptible People\"), with its people being called Burkinab\u00e9 (\"upright people\"). His foreign policies were centred on anti-imperialism, with his government refusing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritising education with a nationwide literacy campaign and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles.\nHis national agenda also included planting over 10 million trees to combat the growing desertification of the Sahel, redistributing land from feudal landlords to peasants, suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents and establishing a road and railway construction programme. On the local level, Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour. \nMoreover, he made female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy illegal. He appointed women to high governmental positions and encouraged them to work outside the home and stay in school, even if pregnant. Sankara encouraged the prosecution of officials accused of corruption, counter-revolutionaries and \"lazy workers\" in Popular Revolutionary Tribunals. As an admirer of the Cuban Revolution, Sankara set up Cuban-style Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.\nHis revolutionary programmes for African self-reliance made him an icon to many of Africa's poor. Sankara remained popular with most of his country's citizens. \nHowever, his policies alienated and antagonised several groups, which included the small but powerful Burkinab\u00e9 middle class; the tribal leaders who were stripped of their long-held traditional privileges of forced labour and tribute payments; and the governments of France and its ally the Ivory Coast. \nDeath.\nOn 15 October 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. A week before his assassination, Sankara declared: \"While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas\"."}

The most commonly known example is the decimal point, named so for its use in base 10 notation. Similarly, \"binary point\" is used for base 2. In most English-speaking countries the radix point is usually a small dot (.), but this can vary as other languages can use different notation such as a comma (,) instead.\nExamples.\nIn mathematical notation, each column of numbers represents a power of the radix, with a radix point separating negative powers. For example, the base 10 number formula_2 is read as follows:\nHence, we can unwrap the representation as this:\nTo the left of the radix point is the integer parts (made from positive powers of base 10).

{"id": "741282", "revid": "7849326", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=741282", "title": "Emu War", "text": "The Emu War, also called the Great Emu War, was a military operation in Australia. The army tried to kill many emus because they were pests. The war was fought in late 1932. Farmers were having trouble with the many emus invading the Campion district of Western Australia. Soldiers used Lewis guns to try to kill the emus, a large flightless bird. The media called it the \"Emu War\" when describing the military action. The army did kill some birds. The emu population stayed large and continued to destroy crops.\nBackground.\nAfter World War I, the Australian government gave land to many ex-soldiers from Australia and some from Great Britain. The government gave these settlers land to farm in Western Australia. A lot of the land was not very good. When the Great Depression hit Australia in 1929, the government told these farmers to grow more wheat. The government promised to help by giving money to farmers. But the farmers didn't get the money. Wheat was becoming worth less and less money, and by October 1932 there were big problems in Western Australia. The farmers were ready to harvest the season's crop but also threatening to refuse to deliver the wheat.\nFarmers lives and work became even worse when about 20,000 emus arrived. Emus regularly migrate(move from one area to another in big groups) after breeding each year. They return to the coast from inland areas. Western Australian farmers had cleared more land and made water supplies for their livestock and crops better. The emus found that the settlers' farm lands were good places to live. They began to move into farms. Many moved into the farms around Chandler and Walgoolan. The emus ate and ruined the crops. They also made large holes in fences where rabbits could enter and cause more problems.\nFarmers complained to the government about the birds destroying their crops. A group of veteran settler-farmers went to meet with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. The settler-farmers had been soldiers in World War I. They knew how powerful machine guns were. They asked the government to send machine guns. The minister agreed. But, he had some requests of his own: soldiers must use the guns, not the settler-farmers; the Western Australian government would pay to transport the soldiers; and, the farmers would give food and housing, and pay for the bullets. Pearce also wanted to send the guns because the birds would make good target practice. Some in the government may have thought the military operation was a good way to be seen helping the Western Australian farmers, to stop the secession movement that was starting. A cinematographer(a person who films motion pictures) from Fox Movietone was joined the military campaign.\nThe \"War\".\nMilitary involvement was due to begin in October 1932. The \"war\" was conducted under the command of Major G. P. W. Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Artillery, with Meredith commanding soldiers Sergeant S. McMurray and Gunner J. O'Halloran, armed with two Lewis guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. The operation was delayed, however, by a period of rainfall that caused the emus to scatter over a wider area. The rain ceased by 2 November 1932, whereupon the troops were deployed with orders to assist the farmers and, according to a newspaper account, to collect 100 emu skins so that their feathers could be used to make hats for light horsemen.\nFirst try.\nOn 2 November the men travelled to Campion, where some 50 emus were sighted. As the birds were out of range of the guns, the local settlers tried to herd the emus into an ambush, but the birds split into small groups and ran so that they were difficult to target. Nevertheless, while the first shots from the machine guns was not hurting the emus because they were far away, a second round of gunfire was able to kill \"a number\" of birds. Later the same day they found a small flock and \"perhaps a dozen\" birds were killed.\nNext, on 4 November, Meredith prepared an ambush near a local dam. They saw more than 1,000 emus heading towards Meredith and his soldiers. This time the gunners waited until the birds were very close. Then, they started to fire their guns. The guns jammed after only twelve birds were killed. The surviving birds ran away before any more could be shot. They did not see any more birds that day.\nAfter losing the Battle of the Dam, Meredith moved further south, because he heard the birds were \"fairly tame\". But, again he had only limited success even though he and his men tried very hard to kill more emus. By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers reported that birds looked well organized. \"Each pack seems to have its own leader now \u00a0\u2013 a big black-plumed bird which stands fully six feet high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them of our approach\". Meredith was desperate. He even tried to put one of the guns on a truck. This failed because the truck was slower than the emus. The ride was so rough that the gunner could not fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the first fighting, the army had fired 2,500 bullets. Nobody know how many birds were killed. One estimate was 50 birds. Others said from 200 to 500 birds. Settlers gave the large estimate. Meredith's official report said that none of his men were injured.\nOn 8 November, members in the Australian House of Representatives discussed the operation. Following the negative coverage of the events in the local media, that included claims that \"only a few\" emus had died, Pearce took out the military personnel and the guns on 8 November.\nAfter the withdrawal, Major Meredith compared the emus to Zulus and commented on the striking manoeuvrability(ability to move quickly and carefully) of the emus, even while badly hurt.\nSecond try.\nAfter the army retreated, the emu continued to attack crops. Farmers again asked for support, citing the hot weather and drought that brought emus invading farms in the thousands. James Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia lent his strong support to renewal of the military assistance. At the same time, a report from the Base Commander was issued that indicated 300 emus had been killed in the initial operation.\nOn November 12, the Minister of Defence started the war again because of the settlers requests and the Base Commander's report. He explained the decision to the Senate. He said they needed soldiers to fight the serious agricultural threat from the big emu population. The army had agreed to lend the guns to the Western Australian government. The army expected people from the Western Australian government would use the guns. But, there were not enough experienced machine gunners in the state, so Meredith was sent to fight again.\nTaking to the field on 13 November 1932, the military were successful during the first two days. They killed about 40 of the invading emus. The third day, 15 November, was less successful. By 2 December, the soldiers were killing about 100 emus per week. Meredith was recalled on 10 December, and in his report he claimed 986 kills with 9,860 rounds, at a rate of exactly 10 rounds per confirmed kill. In addition, Meredith claimed 2,500 wounded birds had died as a result of the injuries that they had sustained. In judging the success of the cull, an article in the \"Coolgardie Miner\" on 23 August 1935 reported that although the use of machine guns had been \"criticised in many quarters, the method proved effective and saved what remained of the wheat\".\nAfter the War.\nIn and after 1930, people built fences to keep emus out of farms. (The fences stopped dingoes and rabbits too.)\nBy December 1932, people in the United Kingdom had heard about the Emu War. Some people who cared about animals said killing the emus was bad. They called it \"extermination of the rare emu\". Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittell, the eminent Australian ornithologists, described the \"war\" as \"an attempt at the mass destruction of the birds\".\nSome farmers asked the army to fight the emu again in 1934, 1943, and 1948. Each time, the government said no. Instead, the government continued the bounty system that had started in 1923. This worked. For six months in 1934, Western Australians killed 57,034 emu and claimed the bounty money.\nIn November 1950, Hugh Leslie, a newspaper editor and state and federal politician from Western Australia, complained about emus in federal parliament. He asked the Army Minister Josiah Francis to give .303 ammunition from the army to farmers to kill the emus. The minister said yes and gave 500,000 bullets to the farmers."}

The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the Yana) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century. Ishi lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he came out near the foothills of Lassen Peak in Northern California.\n\"Ishi\", which means \"man\" in the Yana language, is an adopted name. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. When asked his name, he said: \"I have none, because there were no people to name me,\" meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name for him.\nIshi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a janitor. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco. His life was shown and discussed in many films and books. A popular biography was \"Ishi in Two Worlds\" published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nIn 1865, Ishi and his family were attacked in the Three Knolls Massacre, in which 40 of their tribesmen were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was believed to be extinct. Prior to the California Gold Rush of 1848\u20131855, the Yahi population numbered 404 in California, but the total Yana in the larger region numbered 2,997.\nThe gold rush brought tens of thousands of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining polluted the water and killed fish. Deer left the area. The settlers brought new infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. The northern Yana group became extinct while the central and southern groups (who later became part of Redding Rancheria) and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, who set bounties of 50 cents per scalp and 5 dollars per head on the natives. In 1865, the settlers attacked the Yahi while they were still asleep.\nSince then more has been learned. It is estimated that with this massacre, Ishi's entire cultural group, the Yana/Yahi, may have been reduced to about sixty people. From 1859 to 1911, Ishi's remote band became more and more mixed with non-Yahi Indian representatives, such as Wintun, Nomlaki, and Pit River members.\nIn 1879, the federal government started Indian boarding schools in California. Some men from the reservations became renegades in the hills. Volunteers among the settlers and military troops carried out more campaigns against the northern California Indian tribes during that period.\nIn late 1908, a group of surveyors found the camp with two men, a middle-aged woman, and an elderly woman. These were Ishi, his uncle, his younger sister, and his mother. Three ran away while the old woman hid herself in blankets because she was sick and unable to run away. The surveyors stole from the camp, and Ishi's mother died soon after he came back. His sister and uncle never returned.\nWalking into the modern world.\nAfter the 1908 attack, Ishi spent three more years in the wilderness, alone. Finally, starving on August 29, 1911, Ishi was captured trying to get meat near Oroville, California, after forest fires in the area.\nThe local sheriff took the man into custody for his protection. The \"wild man\" caught the imagination and attention of thousands of onlookers and curiosity seekers. Professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Museum of Anthropology\u2014now the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)\u2014read about him and brought him to the university. Studied by the university, Ishi also worked as a janitor and lived in an apartment at the museum for most of the remaining five years of his life. In June 1915, he lived in Berkeley with the anthropologist Thomas Talbot Waterman and his family.\nWaterman and Alfred L. Kroeber, director of the museum, studied Ishi closely over the years. They talked with him for a long time. They wanted to understand Yahi culture. He described families, Yahi names, and the ceremonies that he knew. Much tradition had already been lost when he was growing up, as there were few older people in his group. Ishi taught his native Yana language. It was recorded and studied by the linguist Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects.\nIshi died of tuberculosis on March 25, 1916. It is said his last words were \"You stay. I go.\" His friends at the university tried to prevent an autopsy on Ishi's body, since Yahi tradition kept the body in one piece. But the doctors at the University of California medical school performed an autopsy before Waterman could stop them.\nIshi's brain was preserved and the body cremated. Kroeber put Ishi's preserved brain in a Pueblo Indian pottery jar wrapped in deer skin. He sent it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1917. August 10, 2000, the Smithsonian returned it to the descendants of the Redding Rancheria and Pit River tribes. This followed the National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989. According to Robert Fri, director of the National Museum of Natural History, \"Ishi was not the last of his kind ... We learned that as a Yahi\u2013Yana Indian his closest living descendants are the Yana people of northern California.\" His remains were also returned from Colma, and the tribal members intended to bury them in a secret place.\nIshi in popular culture.\nMusic.\nShown in the video for \"blue train lines\" a song by Mount Kimbie and King Krule. The video tells the story of the two anthropologists falling out. One sells all of Ishi's possessions on eBay. (\"kimbie.2017\")"}

People who get the disease might get fever, dry cough, fatigue (tiredness), loss of taste or smell, and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose, or sneezing is less common. In some cases, people might wheeze, have difficulty breathing, have fewer white blood cells, or not be hungry. In severe cases, COVID-19 can kill people. COVID-19 has killed more than one million people around the world. Some infected people are \"asymptomatic carriers\", which means that they spread the virus without anybody knowing they're sick.\nThe countries with the most infected people are the USA, India, and Brazil. The COVID-19 virus travels from one person to another through air droplets.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAccording to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things.\nAccording to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea, and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.\nName.\nIn February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19, replacing the temporary name \"2019-nCoV.\" \"Co\" is for \"corona,\" \"Vi\" for \"virus,\" and \"D\" for \"disease,\" and \"19\" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like \"Wuhan,\" because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.\nHow the virus causes disease.\nThe expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli, have two main types of cells. One cell, type I, absorbs from the air, i.e. gas exchange. The other, type II, produces surfactants, which help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease.\nLung damage.\nScientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but did not from any problem with their lungs. They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and that there was more blood clotting. The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels. Smoking marijuana and tobacco and vaping can further damage your lungs.\nOther organs.\nAccording to doctors and scientists from Columbia University, the virus damages the inside of the blood vessels, which causes blood clotting. The blood clots travel through the body and can damage the heart, kidneys and other systems. The virus can also damage organs by itself. In New York City hospitals, 50% of COVID-19 patients had kidney failure in some way. The scientists said that the kidneys have many ACE2 receptors, the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to sneak into cells.\nLong-term effects.\nSome scientists, for example Robert Stevens of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, are starting studies to watch people who have recovered from COVID-19 to see what long-term effects they have. Scientists think that people who have COVID-19 and do not die might still have lung or brain damage for the rest of their lives.\nOther scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 made the body make less of the male hormone testosterone and considered that SARS-CoV-2 could cause sterility the way the mumps and other viruses do. A sterile man cannot father children naturally.\nCOVID-19 and pollution.\nScientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany, and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs.\nTransmission and prevention.\nThere are many ways to stop the spread of COVID-19. Washing hands for 20\u00a0seconds or more will help kill the viruses. Try not to touch your own face - eyes, nose, or mouth - with unwashed hands.\nPeople should stay away from crowded places if they can, because being close to big groups of people can easily spread the virus. In fact, many health organizations say that people should stay at least two metres or 6\u00a0feet from another person.\nMany people wear face masks in public to stop getting the virus, and it is recommended by countries such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand. Most face masks work best to stop you giving the virus to other people. When people with the virus wear masks they give it to less people. One study published in \"Cell\" showed that wearing a mask pulled down to cover the mouth but not the nose was not good. People usually breathe through their noses and not their mouths. Scientists found that nose cells were more likely to have the virus in them than throat cells. Because of this, the scientists said, breathing out through the nose was more likely to spread the virus than breathing out through the mouth, so people should wear masks that cover their noses.\nOne study in China found the virus in semen from men with COVID-19. The scientists wondered if men could give COVID-19 to partners in sexual intercourse.\nTests and testing.\nExperts recommend testing people for COVID-19. Some people may have SARS-CoV-2 in their bodies but not feel sick right away. These people can spread the virus to others.\nThere are two types of tests. Viral tests show whether a person has the virus right then. Antibody tests show whether the person had the virus and has since recovered.\nA group of scientists from Hokkaido University developed an antibody test that could detect avian flu antibodies in only 20\u00a0minutes. They said their test could be changed to detect SARS-CoV-2.\nMedicines.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is new to humans. This means that there are no medicines that can stop people from getting COVID-19 or that can treat them if they do get it. Scientists are working hard to invent and test new medicines. Some scientists are trying to invent a new vaccine which would stop people from getting sick with COVID-19. Other scientists are testing medicines used for other diseases to see if those medicines make people get less sick if they do get COVID-19.\nVaccines.\nIn April 2020, the group Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said that scientists were looking at 115 compounds that could be a vaccine. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says it takes 18 months to test a vaccine to make sure it works and is safe.\nIn April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc, and tested it in mice.\nAnother team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called \"human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2\" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01.\nIn late April 2020, a team from Oxford University said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.\nIn November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna both said their vaccines had completed some testing. Both were over 90% effective. Both companies asked the United States Food and Drug Administration for permission to start giving the vaccine to people. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA vaccines they teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make than protein or whole-virus vaccines.\nA 90 year old woman from Northern Ireland was the first to receive the Pfizer vaccine on December 8, 2020.\nInterferon beta.\nA study from a British company called Synairgen showed that some patients with mild COVID-19 who took interferon beta were less likely to develop severe COVID-19, and they got better faster. The doctors gave the patients interferon beta by letting them breathe in a spray. The study was performed on 101 patients, which is not many. The scientists gave some patients interferon beta and other patients a placebo, a harmless but empty spray. The COVID-19 patients who received the real medicine were 79% less likely to develop a severe case. As of July 2020, scientists are planning to test inhaled interferon beta in a larger study with 400 patients to see if it really does help.\nUnlike hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta is a common drug. Giving interferon beta to COVID-19 patients would not mean taking medicine away from people with malaria or lupus.\nHydroxychloroquine.\nSome people thought hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, might work against COVID-19. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. United States President Donald Trump said he was taking hydroxychloroquine and told other people to take it too, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, part of the White House official coronavirus task force, said no one could know for sure if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration allowed doctors to give hydroxychloroquine and another drug called chloroquine to COVID-19 patients, but in June, they told doctors to stop. By then, more studies had shown that the drugs did not help much and could harm the patients' hearts.\nRemdesivir.\nSome scientists also think the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against other viruses and it has already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away.\nDoctors gave remdesivir to some COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available. 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works.\nThe chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies.\n On July 3, the European Commission approved remdesivir for use in the very sickest COVID-19 patients.\nGilead Sciences, which makes remdesivir, charges about US$2,340 per patient, and it agreed to send most of its remdesivir to the United States. In July 2020, the Drug Controller General of India approved the third of three generic version of remdesivir made by Indian companies. The cheapest of them costs 4800 rupees per vial, or US$64.31.\nAntibodies.\nSome scientists gave SARS and MERS to llamas so the llamas' immune systems would make antibodies, or natural medicines, against those viruses, and they found a few antibodies that worked. In a May 2020 study, the scientists said this could work with SARS-CoV-2 too.\nPrevention and treatment.\nStaying home when sick will reduce your chances of spreading COVID-19. Wearing a mask and staying 2\u00a0meters (6\u00a0feet) away from people in public, washing your hands, using disinfectants, and avoiding large crowds when outside will help prevent catching COVID-19.\nThe effectiveness of the mask depends on what type of mask it is. While masks like surgical masks are effective, others like a neck gator are not.\nCOVID-19 vaccines, such as Moderna and Pfizer, will reduce your chances of catching the deadly virus. Getting vaccinated is 90%+ effective. People who are vaccinated have a far lower chance of being hospitalized. The single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing COVID-19 2 weeks after vaccination. The Pfizer vaccine can help prevent deadlier variants of the virus, such as the Delta Variant."}

Quantrill led a group of 400 guerrillas and Confederate Army to attack Lawrence. Lawrence had few defenses. Much of the town was destroyed. About 180 men and boys were killed. A militia became active by spring 1864 to prevent another attack.\nFive blockhouses were built by May 1864. One militia group was assigned to stay at each blockhouse. Each blockhouse was built out of logs. They had port holes to be used to aim rifles outside. It is unknown where all the blockhouses were at. One was somewhere in west Lawrence, and two may have been far from town. One was at the intersection of Massachusetts and Winthrop streets; another was at the intersection of Massachusetts and Berkley streets.\nThe exact places are known for only two of the blockhouses. These are:\nBoth Cordley and Ridenour said some people from the militia were assigned to stay at each blockhouse every night. In late October 1864, towns in Kansas were worried when Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price came close to Kansas City from the east. On October 22, three of the five Lawrence militia groups were sent to the front. This left the other two to stay at the blockhouses and guard Lawrence.\nOn October 23, the people of Lawrence heard that the Union army attacking Price were defeated. There was nothing that could stop the Confederates from coming to Lawrence. However, on October 23, it was learned Price's men had been hurt, and they were going south. The two militia groups continued to stay at the blockhouses for about two weeks. The other three groups were busy with following the retreating Confederates.\nThe nightly guard duty and the use of the blockhouses continued until the end of the Civil War. After that time, nothing more was mentioned of the blockhouses."}

BSA began production, under the name \"Model 1914\". The design was officially approved for service on 15 October 1915 under the name \"Gun, Lewis, .303-cal.\" No Lewis guns were produced in Belgium during the war; all manufacture was carried out by BSA in England and the Savage Arms Company in the US.\nProduction.\nThe Lewis was produced by BSA and Savage Arms during the war. The two versions were very similar, but there were enough differences to stop them being completely interchangeable. This problem was fixed by the time of the Second World War.\nDesign details.\nThe Lewis gun was gas operated. \nThe Lewis gun used a pan magazine holding 47 or 97 rounds.\nThe gun fired about 500\u2013600 rounds per minute. It weighed 28\u00a0lb (12.7\u00a0kg), only about half as much as a typical medium machine gun of the era, such as the Vickers machine gun. It could be carried and used by one soldier.\nService.\nFirst World War.\nDuring the first days of the war, the Belgian Army had put in service 20 prototypes (5 in 7.65\u00d753mm and 15 in .303) for the defense of Namur.\nAircraft use.\nThe Lewis was the first machine gun fired from an airplane. On 7 June 1912, Captain Charles Chandler of the US Army fired a Lewis gun from the foot-bar of a Wright Model B Flyer."}

Rhode Island police has suspected Alahverdian of faking his own death.\nAlahverdian said that he was abused as a minor while under the care of the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth &amp; Families. Over this, he sued the organization in 2011 in federal court, then withdrew the lawsuit when Rhode Island waived his ~$200,000 medical fees.\nIn 2008, Alahverdian, then known as Nicholas Rossi, was convicted of \"sexual imposition\" and public indecency over an incident with another student at Ohio's Sinclair Community College, where he studied in. Alahverdian requested that the trial be restarted based on new evidence from the Internet. A computer expert analyzed the new evidence in 2011. He was 90% confident that it was fake, pointing to a date error which only a human would make, not a computer. The judge refused Alahverdian's request for the trial as the new evidence was \"not credible\".\nIn 2015, Alahverdian was married for the second time; the couple ended their marriage by 2017, after a court ruled that Alahverdian was \"guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty\" towards his wife.\nIn January 2020, Alahverdian said that he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. According to his family, Alahverdian died of the disease on February 29, 2020. His wife said that Alahverdian would be cremated and that Alahverdian's remains would be scattered at sea. Upon Alahverdian's death, WPRI reported that he had moved out of the United States around four years earlier, with his wife saying that it was because they were not safe in the United States.\nIn July 2020, Rhode Island State Police looked into whether Alahverdian's reported death was real; no conclusion was reached by January 2021. The investigation occurred due to claims that Alahverdian was still alive, plus a warrant against Alahverdian as he was accused of failing to register as a sex offender in Rhode Island due to his 2008 conviction.\nJust before his illness and death, Alahverdian knew that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating him for fraud, said his former lawyer Jeffrey Pine. The FBI's investigation happened because his foster mother Sharon Lane claimed that he opened 22 credit cards under her husband's name, spending over $200,000 which her husband now owed. Pine was suspicious whether Alahverdian really died, because his illness and death were reported so quickly after Alahverdian learned of the FBI investigation. Lane believed that Alahverdian was still alive, because in her opinion, the obituary and memorials written about him had a writing style matching Alahverdian's.\nA person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow denied that he had faked his death, but also refused to provide copies of his death certificate to the media. According to a Rhode Island pastor, he had been contacted by a person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow, who had requested the holding of a mass in tribute to Alahverdian. The pastor said that a Rhode Island policeman told him not to hold the event, and that the policeman also said that Alahverdian had faked his death, with the person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow possibly being Alahverdian himself using a \"device that can change people's voices\". A person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow, 'Louise', also sent an email in January 2021 to \"The Providence Journal\", which included criticism of people who had past connections to Alahverdian, including the victim of Alahverdian's sexual offenses, the police officer who took Alahverdian's sexual offenses case, the judge who oversaw Alahverdian's sexual offenses case, and Alahverdian's former foster parents."}

During its existence from 911-609 BC, it was the largest empire in the world up to that time, doing many early techniques of imperialism which became normal in later empires. It was, according to many historians, the first real empire in history. It also pioneered many tactics such as arming themselves with iron weapons and employing advanced, effective military tactics.\nAfter the conquests of Adad-nirari II in the 900s BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire became the successor to the Old Assyrian Empire (2025-1378 BC) and the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-934 BC), and dominated the Ancient Near East, the East Mediterranean, Asia Minor, the Caucasus, and parts of both the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa, conquering and lasting longer than their rivals, such as Babylonia, Elam, Persia, Urartu, Lydia, the Medes, Phrygia, the Cimmerians, Israel, Judah, Phoenicia, the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Canaan, the Kushite Empire, and Ancient Egypt.\nThe empire began to fall in 631 BC when Ashurbanipal died, and many civil wars, allowing Cyaxares, King of Persia and the Medes, to form an alliance with Nabopolassar, Ruler of Babylonia and the Cimmerians and invade Assyria. Assyria allied itself with Egypt, but they both fell at the Fall of Harran in 609 BC. The second Siege of Harran finally ended Assyria. However, even today there are still Assyrian people living in Iran, Iraq, and elsewhere.\nHistory.\n911-859 BC.\nThe campaigns of Adad-nirari II allowed Assyria to become a great power after overthrowing the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt and conquering Elam, Urartu, Media, Persia, Mannea, Gutium, Phoenicia/Canaan, Arabia, Israel, Judah, Philistia, Edom, Moab, Samarra, Cilicia, Cyprus, Chaldea, Nabatea, Commagene, Dilmun, Shutu, and the Neo-Hittites, as well as removing the Nubians, Kushites, and Ethiopians from Egypt and forcing a tribute from Phrygia and others. In addition, he and his successors conquered areas previously only somewhat under Assyrian control, and deporting Arameans and Hurrians. He then twice attacked and defeated Shamash-mudammiq of Babylonia and again to his successor, Nabu-shuma-ukin I. \nThe next three kings were also equally aggressive. Tukulti-Ninurta II in 891 BC succeeded Adad-nirari II and expanded into Asia Minor and the Zagros Mountains, before being succeeded by Ashurnasirpal II in 883 BC, who recovered much of the territory lost after the fall of the Middle Assyrian Empire in 1100 BC, and ended an uprising caused by the Lullibi and Gutian people. He and his successor and son, Shalmaneser III were known for their ruthlessness and policies of deportation, as well as their love of art. Ashurnasirpal II also moved the capital to Kalhu.\n859-783 BC.\nAnnual campaigns under Shalmaneser III allowed both the capital to be turned into an army camp and the occupation of important rivals. Babylon was occupied and Babylonia came under Assyrian rule, however the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC against Aramean states ended in a stalemate. In 849 BC Carchemesh was occupied and by 842 BC Damascus was forced to pay tribute, as well as Tyre and Sidon, then part of Phoenicia in 841 BC.\nA civil war then began in 828 BC as his eldest son Ashur-nadin-aplu and 27 cities rebelled against the governors of Assyria, allowing Babylonia, the Medes, Manneans, Arameans, Neo-Hittites, and Persians to largely recapture their land and Urartu to exert its influence in the region. Second son of Ashurnasirpal Shamshi-Adad V finally ended the Civil War in 824 BC, the same year as his father's death, and spent almost the entire rest of his reign trying to re-conquer lost land before his death in 811 BC, when succeeded by his wife, Queen Sammuramat and then his son Adad-nirari III in 806 BC.\nAdad-nirari III was an aggressive Monarch, invading The Levant, subjugating the Arameans, Phoenicians, Philistines, Israelites, Neo-Hittites and Edomites, reinforcing tribute upon Damascus, invading Persia and subjugating the Persians, Medes, and Manneans up to the Caspian Sea, and conquering the Chaldean and Sutu tribes of southern Mesopotamia.\n783-745 BC.\nAfter the death of Adad-nirari III in 783 BC there was a period of stagnation, when Shalmaneser IV led only minor victories against Urartu during the Battle of Til Barsip, Arameans and Neo-Hittites before his own death in 773 BC. Another set of civil wars beset the reigns of Ashur-dan III, who reigned from 772-754 BC and Ashur-nirari IV from 754-745 BC, with uprisings in Ashur, Arrapkha, and Guzana, the failure to invade Aram-Naharaim or Babylonia, an outbreak in plague, and a solar eclipse, seen as a bad omen. Ashur-nirari IV was deposed by general Pulu, who changed his name upon becoming King to Tiglath-Pileser III in 745 BC, bringing back Assyria.\n744-727 BC.\nAs soon as Tiglath-Pileser took the throne in 744, Assyria had both civil war and pestilence threatening it, while a war with Uratru was lost. However, Tiglath Pileser III made enormous changes to the structure of Assyria, improving its security and efficiency. The provinces \nINCOMPLETE"}

To keep the plant in operation, Keith developed a fruit flavored drink made from apple fiber, left over from cider pressings, and whey, a byproduct from cheese manufacture, creating Fanta.\nFanta sold three million cases in 1943, sustaining the firm's business in Germany. In 1945, at the last stages of the war, Keith was ordered by a German general to rename the subsidiary, but he refused. The general was killed in an air raid before any action was taken against Keith."}

{"id": "744158", "revid": "396686", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=744158", "title": "Atlanta Student Movement", "text": "The Atlanta Student Movement was formed in February 1960 in Atlanta by students of the six colleges in the Atlanta University Center (AUC). The Committee on the Appeal for Human Rights (COAHR) led the Atlanta Student Movement. It was part of the Civil Rights Movement. Its goal was to end segregation, the laws that separated African-American people from white people. In Atlanta, and other places in the United States, segregation gave African-American people fewer rights than white people.\nThe Beginning of the Movement.\nOn February 3, 1960, Atlanta University Center (AUC) senior, Lonnie King, read about the sit-in at the Woolworth Store in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. A sit-in is a kind of protest. People sit someplace and will not leave until they get what they want. The people sitting-in at the Woolworths store restaurant were African-American college students. They wanted to be able to eat at the store's restaurant along with white people. King also thought it was fair for African-American people in Atlanta to be able to eat at the same restaurants as white people. King talked to other students, Joseph Pierce and Julian Bond. They decided to organize a Student Movement in the four colleges at the Atlanta University Center. Their goal was to convince all restaurants in Atlanta to serve food to all people.\nOn February 5, 1960, approximately fifteen students attended the first meeting. The first sit-in did not have enough people. The students' universities called a meeting with the Atlanta University Center's college Presidents. Each president explained their opinion of the sit-in movement. The four presidents asked students not to have sit-ins. The presidents wanted lawyers to make changes by asking courts to force restaurants to change. They asked students to work hard on their school work. The presidents suggested the students write an advertisement for the newspapers about what they wanted restaurants to do. The presidents paid to put the advertisement in the newspaper.\nLonnie King asked Roslyn Pope, Morris Dillard, Albert Brinson, Julian Bond, and Charles Black to write the advertisement. It was called \"An Appeal for Human Rights.\" It explained why it was bad for African-American people and white people to have different rights. It asked for changes. On March 9th, 1960, An Appeal for Human Rights was published as a full-page ad in Atlanta Constitution, Atlanta Journal, and Atlanta Daily World. It was also published in the New York Times, Harvard Crimson, and Nation magazine. New York Senator Jacob Javits read it out loud in Congress so that the words would be saved in the Congressional Record.\nOn March 16th, 1960, the representatives from all the colleges in the Atlanta University Center met. Students started a new group, called the \"Committee on Appeal for Human Rights\" (COHAR). All the students agreed to start a committee to lead the group. They also agreed that each college should have three students on the committee. The people on the committee were:\nLonnie King was the Chairman, or leader; John Mack was theCo-Chairman, or second leader.\nSit-ins, Protests, and Boycotts.\nThe students wanted to make more changes. On March 15th, 1960, more than two hundred Atlanta University Center students had sit-ins. They went to eleven restaurants in downtown Atlanta. Seventy-seven students were arrested for sitting-in. The six students who signed \"An Appeal for Human Rights\" were also arrested. \nAfter their summer vacation, students started protesting again. Lonnie King was still the Chair of COHAR. Herschelle Sullivan was the new Co-Chair of COHAR. She was studying in France when COHAR started. In September she returned to Spelman. She wanted to protest, too. \nIn fall of 1960, Lonnie King and Herschelle Sullivan requested that Dr. Martin Luther King protest with them. There was a presidential election that year. John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon both wanted to be president of the United States. But neither Nixon nor Kennedy was talking about the African-American student protests. They believed that Dr. King could help get attention from Nixon or Kennedy. \nOn October 19th, 1960, hundreds of students had sit-ins in Atlanta restaurants. Dr. King went with them. The police arrested many students. The police also arrested Dr. King. The next day, even more people protested. Three days later, Atlanta Mayor Hartsfield met with COHAR. COHAR asked everyone to stop protesting. The students got out of jail. The students, Mayor Hartsfield, and restaurant owners tried to talk to each other about segregation.\nThe talks did not fix the problem. Students protested more. Arrested students would stay in jail. Staying in jail was another protest. The jails had too many people. The city government had a hard time.[5] Before Christmas the African-American adults protested with the students. They would not buy Christmas presents from stores in Atlanta that were owned by white people. Stores in Atlanta sold $10 million fewer presents. It hurt the stores. The owners were more willing to talk to COHAR leaders, but no one could agree to end segregation. In February, 1961, COHAR decided no one would shop at stores owned by white people until April, 1961.\nOn March 6th, 1961, adults called Lonnie King and Herschelle Sullivan to a meeting. White adults and African-American adults were at the meeting. Those adults agreed to wait six months to end segregation in restaurants. The United States government said Atlanta needed to let African-Amerian children go to the same schools as white children. The adults decided that restaurants could be segregated until after schools fixed their problem. Lonnie King and Herschelle Sullivan refused this agreement. However, both the African-American and white adults said they must agree. King and Sullivan felt angry that African-American adults agreed to wait. They finally agreed, too.\nOn March 10th, 1961, COHAR had a big meeting about this agreement. The agreement to wait made students very angry. They felt angry at the adults, not angry at Lonnie King or Herschelle Sullivan. Dr. Martin Luther King Sr. spoke to the meeting. He asked people to follow the agreement and said: \u201cIf anyone breaks this contract, let it be the white man.\u201d\nAchievements.\nRestaurants in Atlanta department stores began serving African-American customers September 28, 1961. In 1964 other restaurants ended segregation."}

Triacylglycerides are the main energy source in the body. They are stored in fat tissue called adipose tissue. Body fat in humans and animals and vegetable oil contain triglycerides. Triglycerides are found in the blood and in fat cells. \nTriglycerides are made of three fatty acids connected to a glycerol. The long, repeating chain of carbons and hydrogens at the end of the fatty acid, called the fatty acid \"tail\", makes the molecule hydrophobic, meaning it does not mix with water. These hydrophobic tails are why oil and water do not mix. The longer the fatty acid tail length, the more energy the triglyceride has. \nThere are two main types of triglycerides, saturated and unsaturated fats. Saturated fats have carbon atoms that have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible. Saturated fats have a higher melting point and are usually solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats have a least one carbon-carbon double bond, so there are not as many hydrogen atoms on the carbons. Unsaturated fats have a lower melting point and are usually liquid at room temperature. Oils are usually unsaturated fats. Saturated fats give the body more energy than unsaturated fats. \nTo use the energy stored in the triglyceride, our body breaks down the triglycerides into smaller molecules, called Acetyl-CoA (). Acetyl-CoA is further broken down in an energy producing process called the Krebs cycle. The Kreb cycle is the same process that gives us energy from the carbohydrates, like bread and sugar, we eat."}

The people at the time said, that most forms of therapy were developed by men, but the majority of people seeking counseling or therapy are women. Many people believing in feminist therapy say that when a woman undergoes a therapy, this therapy should also take into account that she is a woman. Feminist therapy grew out of concerns that established therapies were not helping women. Specific concerns of feminist therapists included gender bias and stereotyping in therapy; blaming victims of physical abuse and sexual abuse; and the assumption of a traditional nuclear family."}

It is often used in the context of testing whether drugs are effective against a set of symptoms. When doing the test, the participants are randomly put into different groups. Each group is treated differently, and at the end the results are compared. A common case is that one group will receive a placebo drug, while the other will receive the real one. The trial is called blinded, if the participants, or those giving the drugs do not know what group a patient is in. \nHistory.\nControlled studies and trials have been done for a long time. In 1753, James Lind published a study that shows that scurvy could be treated by a diet including many lemons and oranges. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor in Vienna, established the term \"systematic controlled observation\". Semmelweis is known today because he linked an increase in childbed fever to missing hygiene in hospitals. At the end of the 19th century, the first problem of not assigning people to test groups randomly became apparent. Austin Bradford Hill established the term \"randomized controlled trial\" in the 1940s. He did a study regarduing the treatment of tuberculosis with Streptomycin (an antibiotic) in the 1940s. This study is seen as thew first randomized controlled triall."}

After a severe injury of his left knee in 1991, he quit playing pro football.\nCoaching career.\nHe started his coaching career when he was 25. His first senior job came across when he took over 1st division outfield Shahab Zanjan. During his three years with the club, he implemented 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2 systems with flat back four which was refreshing in Iran's football dominated by traditional 3-5-2 formation. Zanjan club produced some fluid and contemporary football despite limited talent and finance.\nAfazali's tactical vision and practical savvy did not go unnoticed. After a friendly match between Iran national football team and Shahab Zanjan in Tehran, Iran's then head coach Miroslav Ciro Blazevic, who had already guided his Croatian side to third place in the 1998 World Cup, invited Afazeli to join the national team staff as technical adviser and analyst.

He was appointed as Steel Azin's head coach on 27 June 2011. while Steel Azin was second on the table on the way for promotion to top flight, FIFA voted to reduce 12 points out of the club due to their case with former coach Theodor Jung and his assistant. On 17 February 2012, Steel Azin and Afazeli decided to part company due to their different views as it has been mentioned.\nOn September 20, 2013, Iranian Football Federation appointed Afazeli as technical director of Iran national under-23 football team, to supervise the team progress and plans for upcoming Asian Championship in Oman which is the first ever championship of the age category in Asia.
