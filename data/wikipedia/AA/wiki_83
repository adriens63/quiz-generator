There are eleven recognised subspecies, and some variation in the colouring. \nThe nest is usually in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. This owl is resident through the year, and highly territorial. Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.\nThis nocturnal bird of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by dropping from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in towns its diet includes a higher proportion of birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The Tawny is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the Eagle owl or Northern Goshawk. Red foxes are an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young.\nAlthough many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's. Rather, it is its asymmetrically placed ears that are key to its hunting. They give the Tawny owl excellent directional hearing. Like most owls, it hunts at night. It has a rather strange, but easily imitated, call."}

Therefore, when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the carbon dioxide in the ocean increases, too.\nWhen carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it makes it more acidic.\nProblems.\nThe skeletons and shells of many sea animals need what is known as calcium carbonate minerals. Due to ocean acidification, there are fewer of these minerals and there are species that could no longer produce or keep their shells. With more carbon dioxide in the ocean, this problem becomes worse and many species will be at risk. As a result, if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, ocean life will be in severe danger.

The word \"Dame\" means a woman who has the title of a Knight. The children were usually taught by women and did not learn very much. The schools were most common from the 17th century to the 19th century. Most of these schools were located in Britain, the United States, and Australia. The Dame schools were also a common place for girls to be educated because they could not go to other schools, which were only for boys. The girls at Dame schools often learned how to sew or do other crafts. \nBritain.\nDame schools were different\u2014some were day care facilities overseen by women who were not literate, but other schools taught the students how to read and write. The differences of Dame schools in England were shown in 1838 by the Statistical Society of London that found almost half of all children surveyed were only taught spelling, with few being taught mathematics and grammar. Dame schools became less common in Britain after the introduction of compulsory education in 1870. Schools that were below government-specified standards of tuition were closed.\nNorth America.\nIn North America, \"dame school\" is a name for a private school with a female teacher during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The education at these schools could be good or very good. Most dame schools were in New England, where every child needed to be literate because of the laws. In the Southern colonies, there were not as many women who knew enough to teach the children.\nMotivated by their Puritan religion, some austrailian women in 17th century opened small, private schools in their homes to teach reading to young children. All children needed to know their religion and how to read because of the Massachusetts School Law of 1642. This law was later made more important by the famous Old Deluder Satan Act. According to Puritan beliefs, Satan would try to keep people from understanding the Scriptures, therefore all children had to be taught how to read. For a small fee, women, often housewives or widows, offered to take in children to whom she would teach a little writing, reading, basic prayers, and religious beliefs. These women received pay in coin, home industries, alcohol, baked goods, and other valuables. Teaching materials generally included a hornbook, primer, Psalter, and Bible. Both girls and boys were provided education through the dame school system. Dame schools generally focused on the four R's of education-\"Riting, Reading, Rithmetic, and Religion\". In addition to primary education, girls in dame schools might also learn sewing, embroidery, and other \"graces\". Most girls received their only formal education from dame schools because of sex-segregated education in common or public schools during the colonial period. If their parents could afford it, after attending a dame school for a rudimentary education in reading, colonial boys moved on to grammar schools where a male teacher taught advanced arithmetic, writing, Latin, and Greek.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, some dame schools offered boys and girls from wealthy families a \"polite education\". The women running these special dame schools taught \"reading, writing, English, French, arithmetic, and music, and dancing\". Schools for upper-class girls were usually called \"female seminaries\", \"finishing schools\" instead of \"dame schools\".\nAustralia.\nThe first school in Australia started in 1789. The school was a Dame school where children were taught basic skills by a prisoner, Isabella Rossen."}

Marines specialize in military actions in other countries, such as amphibious warfare. Marines usually have strong links with the country's navy. The commander in the field is usually the commander of the fleet. Support for the marines such as medical, legal, and supplies come from the navy. The anchor is often used as a symbol for the marines. The word \"marine\" is from the English word \"marine\", meaning \"of the sea\", from the French \"marin(e)\", \"of the sea\" which was from the Latin \"marinus\" (\"maritime\"). The name \"marine\" means \"navy\" in French, Dutch, and German. Marine forces are usually part of the navy, but they can be part of the army or act on their own.\nIn the past the marines have protected ships at sea. When ship crews were pressed (forced to serve) the marines protected the ship from mutiny. They would also board other ships during battle or capture prize ships. They carried out raids on the shore to help the navy. Marines would also take part in campaign ashore, to help the army.\nHistory.\nIn the earliest days of naval warfare, there was little difference between sailors and soldiers on a warship. The oarsmen of Ancient Greek and Roman ships had to be able to fight the oarsmen of other ships. Armed soldiers were used on Greek ships to get on board enemy ships to fight their crews. The Roman Navy's two legions, I \"Adiutrix\" and II \"Adiutrix\", were among the first special naval infantry units.\nThe first organized group of marines was created when Charles V first assigned the naval infantry of the \"Compa\u00f1\u00edas Viejas del Mar de N\u00e1poles\" (Naples Sea Old Companies) to the Escuadras de Galeras del Mediterr\u00e1neo (Mediterranean Galley Squadrons) in 1537. This was the start of the current Spanish Navy Marines (Infanter\u00eda de Marina) corps. The American Marine Corps began on 10 November 1775 in Tun Tavern, Philadelphia, just seven months before America declared its independence on 4 July 1776.\nRoles.\nThe main task for marine troops is military actions near the coast. Based on ships they are trained to land on and secure key points to around 50 miles inland. Marines leave the warships using helicopters, landing craft, hovercraft and amphibious vehicles.\nMarines are also in other naval roles such as boarding other ships, ship clean up, naval port security, mess duty, and field day operations.\nBy country.\nArgentina.\nThe Argentine Marine Corps (\"Infanter\u00eda de Marina de la Armada de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina\" or IMARA) is a part of the Argentine Navy. It has a Fleet Marine Force with one marine battalion, artillery, air defence, communications, logisticss, engineer and vehicle units. There is a Southern Marine Force with two marine battalions, a river operations battalion, a special forces unit (the Amphibious Commandos Group) and several security battalions and companies. The 5th Battalion of the \"Infanteria de Marina\" fought in the Falklands War ().\nIndonesia.\n1. Two Marine Forces (\"Pasukan Marinir\"), a unit similar to a division, led by a Marine Brigadier General.\n2. Three Marine Infantry Brigades (with nine Marine Infantry Battalions).\n3. Two Marine Cavalry Regiments (with Marine Amphibious Tank and also Amphibious Artillery-bearer Landing Craft Battalions).\n4. Two Marine Artillery Regiments (with Marine Rocket, Howitzer and Gun Battalions).\n5. Two Marine Combat Support Regiments, with Marine Engineer, Military Police, Base Defense, Motorized Transportation, Amphibious-Reconnaissance and also Logistic Battalions.\n6. Two Marine Bases in Jakarta and Surabaya.\n7. Two Marine Hospitals.\n8. An anti-terrorism unit called \"Detasemen Jala Mangkara\" (literally \"Sea Ghost Detachment\").\nIraq.\nThe Iraqi Navy is a small force with 800 sailors and six platoons of marines designed to protect the shoreline and inland waterways. The navy also protects offshore oil platforms. The navy will have coastal patrol squadrons, assault boat squadrons and a marine battalion. The force will consist of 2,000 to 2,500 sailors by 2010.\nItaly.\nItalian Navy\nItalian Army\nJapan.\nThe JSDF has brigades operated similar to marines:\nHistorical marine forces.\nAncient Greece.\nThe ancient Greek states did not possess specialized marine infantry, instead they used hoplites and archers as an onboard contingent (\"epibatai\").\nAncient Rome.\nThe Roman Navy used regular infantry as marines. Naval personnel were trained for raiding and also provided the troops for at least two legions (I \"Adiutrix\" and II \"Adiutrix\") for service on land. The various provincial fleets were usually provided with marines from the adjacent legions.\nByzantine Empire.\nFor several centuries, the Byzantine navy used the descendants of the Mardaites, who were settled in southern Anatolia and Greece, as marines and rowers for its ships. Emperor Basil I also established a separate marine regiment, 4,000 strong, for the central Imperial Fleet based at Constantinople. These were professional troops, and were counted among the elite \"tagmata\".\nIn the 1260s, when emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos rebuilt the navy, he recruited the \"Tzakones\" (settlers from Laconia) and the \"Gasmouloi\" (men of mixed Greek-Latin descent) as special marine troops. Despite the progressive decline and virtual disappearance of the navy, they remained active until the late Palaiologan period.\nConfederate States of America.\nThe Confederate States Marine Corps (CSMC), a branch of the Confederate States Navy, was established by the Confederate Congress on 16 March 1861.\nDenmark-Norway.\nMarineregimentet (The Marine Regiment) was the naval infantry of the Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy.\nEstonia.\nThe Meredessantpataljon, was a short lived infantry battalion of the Estonian Navy. The battalion was created in 1919 from the crews of the Estonian surface warships and was based in Tallinn. The unit was mainly used on the Southern Front during the Estonian War of Independence. The unit was operational from March to June in 1919.\nFrance.\nThe \"Troupes de marine\" were founded in 1622 (as \"compagnies ordinaires de la mer\") as land forces under the control of the Secretary of State of the Navy, notably for operations in French Canada. The \"Compagnies de la Mer\" were transformed in line infantry regiments by Napoleon, but became once more marine forces in 1822 (for the artillery) and 1831 (for the infantry). These \"Troupes de marines\" were in the 19th century the main overseas and colonial forces of the French military. In 1900 they were put under the orders of the War Ministry and took the name of \"Troupes Coloniales\" (Colonial Forces). In 1958 the designation of \"Troupes Coloniales\" was changed to \"Troupes d'Outre-Mer\" (Overseas Forces) but in 1961 it reverted to the original \"Troupes de marine\". Throughout these changes in title these troops continued to be part of the French Army.\nGran Colombia.\nThe Confederation of Gran Colombia Marines were formed in 1822 and were disbanded in 1829, Personnel were mostly from Venezuela.\nItaly.\nThe Blackshirt militia maintained an independent \"Marine Group\" with four MVSN battalions (24th, 25th, 50th and 60th).\nJapan.\nBoth the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army maintained marine-type units. Both were dissolved at the end of World War II and Japan no longer has marines.\nLebanon.\nThe Lebanese Forces militia maintained a small elite marine unit until the LF was disarmed and disbanded the unit. The Marines were the navy of the militia and it maintained a force of small boats.\nThe Netherlands.\nThe Corps was founded on 10 December 1665 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War by the unofficial leader of the republic Johan de Witt and Admiral Michiel de Ruyter as the Regiment de Marine. Its leader was Willem Joseph Baron van Ghent. The Dutch had successfully used ordinary soldiers in ships at sea in the First Anglo-Dutch War. It was the fifth European marine unit formed, being preceded by the Spanish Marines (1537), the Portuguese Marines (1610), the French Marines (1622) and the English Royal Marines (1664). Like Britain, the Netherlands has had several periods when its Marines were disbanded. The Netherlands itself was under French occupation or control from 1810 until 1813. A new marine unit was raised on 20 March 1801 during the time of the Batavian Republic and on 14 August 1806 the Korps Koninklijke Grenadiers van de Marine was raised under King Louis Bonaparte. The modern Korps Mariniers dates from 1814, receiving its current name in 1817.\nThe battle honors on the Korps Mariniers' colors are: Raid on the Medway (1667), Kijkduin (1673), Sennefe (1674), Spain, Dogger Bank (1781), West Indies, Algiers (1816), Atjeh, Bali, Rotterdam (1940), Java Sea (1942), Java and Madoera (1947\u20131948), and New Guinea (1962).\nOttoman Empire.\nThe role of Ottoman naval infantry originated in Orhan's conquest of the Karasi Beylik and the capture of its fleet. From then on Janissaries and Azaps were sometimes deployed as marines during the 14th Century. The Deniz azaps were used during the 16th Century; while troops called Levend (Bahriyeli) were raised on and off over the centuries - over 50,000 of them by the late 18th century. The last raised units were the \"Ta'ifat al Ru'sa\" (corsair captains militia) recruited from among the North African Arabs and indigenous Berbers. Ottoman marines were part of the Ottoman navy.\nPortuguese Empire.\nPortugal raised numerous companies of Special Marines (\"Fuzileiros Especiais\") and African Special Marines (\"Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos\"), both at home and in the African colonies of Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique, for service in Africa during the Portuguese Colonial Wars. The African Special Marines were all-black units.\nRussia.\nThe Imperial Russian Navy used several regiments of marine equipage troops that fought as much on land as they served in ship detachments. One battalion was formed within the Guard, and served on the Imperial family's ships.\nThe Ushkuiniks were medieval Novgorodian pirates who led a Viking-like life and often raided other Russian settlements.\nSoviet Union.\nThe Soviet Navy had a number of small battalion-sized naval infantry and coastal defence units that mostly served in the ports and bases before the Second World War. During the war, and building on the visuals of the mutinied sailors of Petrograd in 1917, the Stavka ordered formation of naval infantry brigades from the surplus to either ship or shore duty sailors, and forty brigades served in mostly ground troops roles until 1944 when they were used for amphibious operations in Norway and along the Black Sea coast.\nSouth Africa.\nThe South Africa Marine Corps was set up as a sub-branch of the South African Navy in 1979, with the primary purpose of protecting harbours. The Marines were disbanded in 1989, following a major restructuring of the Navy at the end of the South African Border War.\nRepublic of Vietnam.\nThe forerunner of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps (VNMC) was established by Ngo Dinh Diem, then prime minister of what was then the State of Vietnam on October 13, 1954. The Republic of Vietnam was established in October 1955 after Diem used a fraudulent referendum to topple Bao Dai. The VNMC became defunct on 1 May 1975 after the fall of Saigon.\nYugoslavia.\nThe 12th Naval Infantry Brigade (\"Mornaricka Pesadijska Brigada\") of the Yugoslavian Navy consisted of 900 to 2,000 men in three battalions. A multi-ethnic unit, the brigade was broken up during the dissolution of the Yugoslav federation and saw little action."}

Premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called missing premises, for example:\nIt is understood that Socrates is a man. The fully expressed reasoning is thus:\nIn this example, the first two independent clauses before the comma (namely, \"all men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\") are the premises, while \"Socrates is mortal\" is the conclusion.\nMathematical logic.\nIn logic, an argument requires a set of two declarative sentences (or \"propositions\") known as the premises, with another declarative sentence (or \"proposition\") known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure.\nMore complex arguments can use a series of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic."}

Clements was the first Republican to have served as governor of the U.S. state of Texas since Reconstruction. Clements' eight years in office were the most served by any Texan governor prior to former Governor Rick Perry.\nEarly career.\nClements was born in Dallas and worked as an oil driller for many years. He studied at Southern Methodist University (SMU) but did not finish a degree. He founded SEDCO in 1947, which became the world's largest offshore drilling company. He entered politics as the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. From 1975-1977 he worked under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\nIn 1975, he married political organizer Rita Crocker Clements.\nGovernor.\nOn January 16, 1979, Clements replaced Democrat Dolph Briscoe as governor of Texas. He defeated State Representative Ray Hutchison in the Republican primary by a vote of 115,345 to 38,268. Clements won the November 1978 general election defeating Democrat John Hill. Hill had been the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court and had been the Texas Attorney General for six years. Clements got 49.96% of the votes. With help from the votes of several minor candidates he narrowly won the election. \nClements ran for reelection in 1982 but was defeated by Democratic Attorney General Mark White. People think that he lost votes because the economy was bad.\nThe 1986 return.\nAfter being defeated, Clements was chairman of the board of governors of SMU in Dallas. He ran again in 1986 and won a primary against U.S. Representative Thomas Loeffler of New Braunfels and former Democratic turned Republican Congressman Kent Hance of Lubbock. At the election Clements defeated Governor White getting 52.7% of the votes.\nClements as governor.\nHis first term was marked by SEDCO's involvement in the then largest oil blowout in history, the Ixtoc I oil spill, which caused extensive environmental damage. Charlie Brooks, Jr., became the first prisoner to be executed by lethal injection (December 1982). Clements faced heavily Democratic state legislatures. In 1980, Clements changed the death penalty for Randall Dale Adams to life in prison. Adams was the subject of \"The Thin Blue Line\", an Errol Morris documentary movie. Adams was found to be innocent in 1989 after serving twelve years in prison.\nDuring his second term, Clements worked to reduce crime, improve education, and boost the Texas economy. He tried to improve relations with Mexico, especially on immigration and the War on Drugs.\nFootball scandal.\nClements's second term was hurt by actions he took at SMU. On March 3, 1987, Clements admitted that he and the SMU board of governors had approved a secret plan to pay 13 college football players using money from an alumnus. The NCAA shut down the SMU football program for the 1987 season. They did not have a team in 1988 as well. The shutdown and other sanctions hurt the team for many years. The College of Bishops of the United Methodist Church investigated the scandal. The discovered Clements had met with athletic director Bob Hitch, and agreed that the payments had to continue.\nIn late 1985 then SMU President L. Donald Shields and board of trustees chairman Edwin L. Cox wanted to stop the payments completely. Clements told President Shields to \"stay out of it\" and to \"go run the university\".\nA week later, Clements said he was sorry that he kept making the payments. He said the he had learned about the payments in 1984, and discovered that players had been paid since the mid-1970s. The board \"reluctantly and uncomfortably\" decided to continue paying players who had already been guaranteed payments. However, he now knows that they should have stopped the payments immediately.\nClements faced calls for his impeachment as a result of these statements. Two state legislators argued that he would have never been elected Governor had told the truth about his role in the scandal. Because of this, Clements did not run for a third term as governor. On January 15, 1991, Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards replaced him.\nPost-political life.\nAfter leaving the governorship, Clements worked hard to help Republican candidates seeking office in Texas. He lived in Dallas with his second wife, Rita Crocker. She was later appointed to the University of Texas Regents by Governor George W. Bush. Clements was known for his acerbic, energetic personality, which Democrats hated but Republicans loved. In 1993, he unsuccessfully supported the conservative Congressman Joe Barton in a special election for the U.S. Senate. \n In 2006, Clements raised money for U.S. Senator John McCain to run for President.\nIn June 2009, Clements donated $100 million to UT Southwestern Medical Center, the largest civic donation in Dallas history. A high school in Sugar Land, Texas and a state office building in Austin, Texas are named in honor of Clements.\nDeath.\nOn Memorial Day weekend in 2011, Clements died at age 94 in a Dallas hospital from natural causes."}

A tidal stream generator is a machine that extracts energy from moving water in tides. Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents.\nTidal stream power is the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the three main forms of tidal power generation.\nTidal stream power is a relatively new technology. It was first conceived in the 1970s during the oil crisis.\nThe potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine. Water is about 800 times the density of air. So, water pushing against a turbine can provide much more power than air pushing against a similar turbine at the same speed. Also, the lowest water speeds needed for an economic power project is lower than the wind speed needed for a wind turbine project. In practice, the tide must move at speeds of at least 2\u00a0knots (1\u00a0m/s) even close to neap tides to be a source of power. \nAs with wind power, selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine. Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions, for example at the entrances to bays and rivers, around rocky points, headlands, or between islands or other land masses. \nEnvironmental impact.\nThe main concern has been whether the turbines kill fish. Very little direct environmental research or observation of tidal stream systems exists. Most direct observations consist of releasing tagged fish upstream of the device(s) and direct observation of mortality or impact on the fish.\nOne study of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE, Verdant Power) project in the East River (New York City), utilized 24 split beam hydroacoustic sensors (scientific echosounder) to detect and track the movement of fish both upstream and downstream of each of six turbines. The results suggested (1) very few fish using this portion of the river, (2) those fish which did use this area were not using the portion of the river which would subject them to blade strikes, and (3) no evidence of fish traveling through blade areas.\nWork is currently being conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC) to explore and establish tools and protocols for assessment of physical and biological conditions and monitor environmental changes associated with tidal energy development."}

Ronnie stated in her autobiography that she walked out of the house through the closed and locked rear sliding glass door, shoeless, shattering the glass as she left, and feet all cut up by the time she got to the gate. She never returned. Ronnie Spector filed for divorce in 1972. She wrote a book about her experiences, and said years later: \"I can only say that when I left in the early 1970s, I knew that if I didn't leave at that time, I was going to die there\".

In August 2011, Spector admitted that she went to rehab in order to escape living with Phil.\nTop hits.\nThe first top hit credited to the Ronettes was \"Be My Baby\" in 1963. They had already recorded several hits which were issued and credited to another group, the Crystals. \"Walking in the Rain\" (Ronette version) won a Grammy Award in 1965, and \"Be My Baby\" went into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

He attracted scientific and humanitarian backing for the International African Association (), which he formed during a Brussels Geographic Conference of geographic societies, explorers, and leaders he hosted in 1876. Leopold used the Association and the defunct \"Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo\" () as a way to claim most of the Congo Basin. \nLeopold created the International Association of the Congo () as a new organization. The entity was officially recognized by the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 and various governments. On May 29, 1885, the king named his new colony the Congo Free State () and ruled it as a dictator (even though he never visited his colony and Africa).\nThe Congo Free State under Leopold II used slave labor and mutilation of their hands, in order to get full control and force the natives to work at extracting natural resources, mainly rubber and ivory, for Leopold II's personal profit.\nHis harsh rule was responsible for the deaths of between five to 10 million Congolese people. The Congo became one of the most infamous international scandals of the early 20th century. As a result, Leopold II was forced to give control of it to the government of Belgium. The Belgian government took control in 1908 and created the Belgian Congo."}

He is the only Englishman ever to have been Pope.\nLife.\nBreakspear was born near St. Albans in Hertfordshire in England. His father was Robert, who later became a monk at St Albans Abbey. Nicholas himself, however, was not yet to attend the monastery. He was told by the Abbot to 'wait to go on with his schooling so that he might be considered more suitable' (Abbey chronicles). He did not wait and went instead to Paris. He finally became a canon regular of the cloister of St. Rufus monastery near Arles. He rose to be Prior and soon was unanimously elected Abbot. This election has been traditionally dated to 1137. Evidence from the Abbey's chronicles suggests it was about 1145.\nIn 1146, Breakspear was made Bishop of Albano. Pope Eugene III raised Breakspear to the rank of Cardinal in the same year, 1146.\nFrom 1152 to 1154, Cardinal Breakspear was the papal legate to Scandinavia.\nPope.\nCardinal Breakspear was elected pope on 3 December 1154. He chose the name Adrian IV. He at once tried to bring down Arnold of Brescia, the leader of the anti-papal faction in Rome. Disorder in the city led to the murder of a cardinal. Adrian, shortly before Palm Sunday 1155, took the step of putting Rome under interdict. The Senate (City Council of Rome) then exiled Arnold.\nPope Adrian was involved in Italian and European political disputes.\nA proposed alliance with the Eastern Byzantine Empire came to nothing.

It's characterized by daily cough and mucus (sputum) production.\nSymptoms of COPD include difficulty breathing and cough, in particular coughing up lots of phlegm. It is usually caused by smoking cigarettes, and around half of people who smoke for their whole lives will develop COPD. In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes.\nAt the beginning of the disease, the difficulty breathing is only noticeable when exercising, but over many years it gradually becomes worse, until there is difficulty breathing even when sitting or lying down. It can also lead to infections of the lung, which may be serious enough to cause death. \nThe most important step in treating COPD is to stop smoking. Exercise and medications can also help. The most commonly used medications are called bronchodilators, which help to open up the airways and allow more air into the lungs.\n3% of all disability is related to COPD. People can die from COPD. The World Health Organization predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. It is thought that more people will die from it in the future."}

So, the native Irish after this were virtually unrepresented since they were almost all Catholic.\nThe Irish Parliament's power was restricted by \"Poynings law\". Poynings Law was a bill sponsored by English Lord Deputy of Ireland Sir Edward Poynings in 1494. In 1782, the bill was repealed and the kingdom of Ireland had brief period of legislative autonomy. But in 1800 it passed a law called the Act of Union to abolish itself and the kingdom of Ireland, and incorporate Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After that, the island was represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the Palace of Westminster."}

She is well known for her trademark sobbing styles. She was popular during the 1950s and 1960s and topped the Billboard Hot 100 musical charts many times.\nPersonal life.\nConnie Francis was born on December 12th 1937 to Ida and George Franconero. For the first few years of her life she lived in a Brooklyn neighbourhood on Utica Avenue/St. Marks Avenue until her family packed up and moved to New Jersey. She spent her teens years in an Italian/Jewish Neighbourhood; due to this, she became fluent in Yiddish and later went on to record multiple songs in Yiddish and Hebrew.\nCareer.\nFrancis recalls her father being a very supportive and encouraging her to regularly attend talent shows, pageants, etc. since the age of four as a singer and accordion player. She attended Newark Art School in 1951-\u201952 until her family moved to Belleville, where she graduated as Salutatorian from Belleville High School in the Class of 1955. During this time she continued her passion for performing and appeared at many neighbourhood talent shows (some of which were televised). Under the name Connie Franconero she appeared on NBCs variety show Startime Kids between 1953 and 1955.\nDuring rehearsals for her appearance on Arthur Godfreys Talent Scouts, she was advised to change her name (for the sake of easier pronunciation) and drop the accordion, advice she gladly took as she had begun to despise the bulky instrument. She was also a singer on demo records around this time, she would record songs and companies or established singers would subsequently choose whether or not to buy the rights to the song and record it professionally. \nIn 1955 (the same year the Startime Kids went off the air), George Franconero Sr. and Francis' manager George Scheck raised money for a recording session in an attempt to get four songs sold to a major company under Francis\u2019 name, however they were declined as she had not yet developed her own distinctive sound. \nWhen MGM Records finally signed her, it was only because of one song, \u201cFreddy\u201d, that the co-executive thought would make a good present for his son of the same name. Her first few singles were commercial failures, her first chart success was in 1957 and that was a duet with Marvin Rainwater.\nHer breakthrough, although amazing, came too late, after the failure of her last few singles her company said that her contract would not be renewed. This led her to consider a career in medicine and was about to accept a four year scholarship had it not been for her father, who insisted that she record a cover of \u201cWho\u2019s Sorry Now?\u201d This, like the rest of her singles, at first went unnoticed but in 1958, after she did a performance on TV, it reached no. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and no.4 in the US and her contract was immediately renewed.\nOver the next several years she would have many more commercial successes and would record some songs in European languages (such as, \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" that was first on German charts, and others in Yiddish, Irish, Hebrew, French, etc.). After 15 years of this success she decided to allow her contact to run out and to distance herself from the business and would on appear on shows as a special guest.\nAfter her moderate success with one single, she began to perform regularly again but sadly this led to an extremely tragic event; when performing at a music fair in New York in 1974 she was raped at a motel and almost suffocated under the weight of the mattress her attacker had thrown upon her. She subsequently sued the motel she was staying in and received $2.5 million, this entire ordeal led to a reform in hotel security but her rapist was never found. Francis went into a deep depression and reportedly began to abuse pills daily and rarely left her home.\nIn 1977 she decided to get nasal surgery and almost lost her voice, leading to her having to attend several other surgeries and vocal lessons. A year after losing her voice she returned to the studio to cut an album called \u201cWho\u2019s Happy Now?\u201d She recorded \u201cWhere the Boys Are\" also in Japanese, Italian, and Spanish, as she had done before with her original 1960 version. Again in 1981 she returned to the studio to record her original releases under MGM records.\nIn 1981, more tragedy struck Francis as her Brother George Franconero Jr. (with whom she was very close) was killed by mafia hitmen. Despite this event she took up performing again, her newfound success was short-lived though as she was soon diagnosed with manic depression and was committed to a total of 17 hospitals. Francis admitted she even attempted suicide due to the hospitals environments being extremely upsetting. Despite this, she was able to publish her autobiography \"Who\u2019s Sorry Now\" that\u2019s went on to become a \"The New York Times Bestseller\".\nIn 1989 she resumed her career and re-recorded 18 of her biggest hits and in \u201992 one of her biggest German hit charted and ended up among the best singles of the year, this brought Francis the R.SH-Gold award for best comeback of the year. She continued to perform live in the more recent years also, in Las Vegas in 2004, San Francisco in 2007 and Manila in 2008. She also appeared at the Las Vegas Hilton with Dionne Warwick and in 2017 released her most recent autobiography \"Among My Souvenirs\"."}

After, they began developing their plan for a microfinance project that became Kiva. Kiva means \u201cunity\u201d in Swahili. \nIn January 2006, Premal Shah became Kiva\u2019s president. More and more countries were included in Kiva\u2019s projects like Mongolia, Liberia and Columbia in 2009. On top of that, since its creation, the organization has won a lot of prizes, for example the World Summit Award for \u201ce-Business\u201d in 2007 and the Webby People\u2019s Choice Award for Charitable Organizations in 2008.\nKiva has become more and more popular. It belongs to the \u201c50 best websites 2008\u201d according to TIME magazine. President Clinton\u2019s book \"Giving\" names Kiva \"a way to give back\". In October 2010, Kiva celebrated its fifth birthday. In five years it has given 100 million loans.\nHow it works.\nKiva follows the rules of microcredit. Small, interest-free loans to people in difficulties or who cannot access a regular bank loan. The following points represent the different steps of the Kiva system.\nTo simplify all the transfers of money, there is a Kiva account which allows you to have a Kiva credit. When you are repaid, the money is available on this account, and you can loan it again. So, if you loan 25$, when you have been repaid you can lend it again, and actually, you have given 50$!\nKiva has achieved a total value of all loans at present of 251 142 725 $\nKiva's home base.\nIn July 2007, the Kiva headquarters moved to their current address at 3180 18th Street, San Francisco.\nKiva's team.\nKiva's team is composed of around 450 employees and volunteers who work for the organisation. There are different sectors:\nEveryone who works for the organisation is personally engaged in Kiva. \nThe microcredit system.\nThe system of microcredit generally deals with the attribution of low sum loans to businessmen or artisans who cannot have regular bank loans. Microcredit is being developed in developing countries : nations with a low level of material wealth, where it allows small \u201cmicro\u201d projects to become reality. It favours activity and wealth creation. Microcredit is also practiced in developed countries.\nMicrocredit is one of the financial sectors, like savings, micro insurance and others which compose the microfinance system.\nOn the 13th October 2006, Muhammad Yunus and the bank he created, Grameen Bank, were awarded the Nobel Peace prize. They were rewarded because of microcredit development at international, almost worldwide level.\nThis microcredit system is aimed at local economic development generally in poor countries to help small businesses and artisans to increase their goods or services production. Thanks to this system, little by little it allows economic development at national level, then at international level. It represents a solution to improve the situation of poor people."}

To prevent this divers would stop at various points as they returned toward the surface to allow their bodies to adjust to the pressure change.

On October 6, 2009, he won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit\u2014the CCD sensor\".\nLife.\nBorn in Amherst, Nova Scotia, he was the son of a medical doctor and moved to Quebec with his father and mother Beatrice when he was three. He was home schooled by his mother until age fourteen, when he attended Montreal's Lower Canada College to complete his secondary education. Boyle attended McGill University, but his education was interrupted in 1943, when he joined the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. He was loaned to the Britain's Royal Navy, where he was learning how to land Spitfires on aircraft carriers as the war ended. He gained a Bachelor of Science (1947), Master of Science (1948) and PhD (1950) from McGill University.\nCareer.\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Boyle spent one year at Canada's Radiation Laboratory and two years teaching physics at the Royal Military College of Canada. In 1953 Boyle joined Bell Labs a part of Bellcomm, where he invented the first continuously operating ruby laser with Don Nelson in 1962. He also helped invent a semiconductor injection laser. He became director of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at the Bell Labs in 1962. They provided support for the Apollo space program and helped to select Moon landing sites. He returned to Bell Labs in 1964, working on the development of integrated circuits. \nIn 1969, Boyle and George E. Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD). Before CCDs were used in cameras, all cameras used chemicals to capture photographic images. CCDs made electronic photography possible. Boyle and Smith jointly received the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1973, the 1974 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award, the 2006 Charles Stark Draper Prize, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the CCD. NASA used the CCD to send clear pictures to Earth back from space. CCD is also used in many digital cameras today. Smith said of their invention: \"After making the first couple of imaging devices, we knew for certain that chemistry photography was dead.\"\nBoyle was Executive Director of Research for Bell Labs from 1975 until his retirement in 1979. In retirement, he split his time between Halifax and Wallace, Nova Scotia where he helped launch an art gallery with his wife Betty, a landscape artist. He married Betty in 1947, and has four children, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2010. Boyle died in Wallace from kidney disease."}

It was invented to help teach children articles of the Catholic faith without drawing attention from government officials, using imagery as a tool to help the children remember. The song represents increasingly grand gifts given during each of The Twelve Days of Christmas. The partridge in a pear tree symbolizes Christ on the Cross. The two turtledoves represent his Human and divine nature, the two books of the Old and New Testament, and the two tablets the Ten Commandments were carved on. The three French hens symbolize the Trinity of the Catholic faith: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, as well as the three Cardinal virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity. The four calling birds were the four Evangelists who wrote the gospels, etc.\nThis Christmas song has been subject to parody numerous times and has been covered by multiple musicians, including though not limited to Connie Francis, Natalie Cole, and the Muppets over many years."}

The three founders were soon joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form a seven-member \"brotherhood\". After they had broken up, John William Waterhouse painted in their style. Their influence shrank as the impressionists and post-impressionists became more important.\nThe group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what they considered to be the 'mechanistic approach'. This was first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed that the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art. So, they are called Pre-Raphaelites. \nIn particular, they objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called \"Sir Sloshua\". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, \"sloshy\" meant \"anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind\". In contrast, they wanted to return to the abundant detail, intense colours, and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art.\nThe Pre-Raphaelites continued to accept the idea of history painting, and the imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. Despite this, they were a reform movement: they created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, \"The Germ\", to promote their ideas. Their debates were recorded in the \"Pre-Raphaelite Journal\".\nThe Brotherhood were highly praised by the art critic John Ruskin, and in turn they were influenced by his ideas. Rossetti's wife Elizabeth Siddal was their favourite model, and she developed into an excellent artist herself."}

It is completely within the City of Westminster. St. James's lies to the south of the eastern section of the street, while the western section overlooks Green Park. The area to the north is Mayfair.\nIt is the location of Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Royal Academy, The Ritz Hotel, the RAF Club and Hatchards book shop. Simpsons, once amongst the United Kingdom's leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s. The store closed in 1999 and the site is now the flagship shop of the booksellers Waterstone's.\nHistory.\nThe name Piccadilly may come from a tailor named Robert Baker, in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling \"piccadills\" \u2013 stiff collars with scalloped edges and a lace border, which were then in fashion. With his great fortune he bought a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London.\nAfter the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, Piccadilly and the area to the north (Mayfair) began to be systematically developed as a fashionable residential locality. Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of Piccadilly: Clarendon House, Berkeley House (later Devonshire House), and Sir John Denham's house (later Burlington House) were built in the 17th century. Later mansions included Melbourne House (now The Albany), Apsley House, Bath House and Cambridge House. Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street, and that part was colloquially referred to as Rothschild Row. \nBy the 1920s most of these buildings had been demolished or were in institutional use. The enlargement of Park Lane and the formation of Hyde Park Corner as a major traffic gyratory system has cut off the western stretch of Piccadilly, with the result that Apsley House has become detached from it.\n21st century Piccadilly is not one of London's principal shopping streets, despite the presence of several famous shops. The Ritz Hotel is in the street, along with some other luxury hotels. There are also some offices and some very expensive flats. Piccadilly is one of the widest and straightest streets in central London."}

{"id": "313781", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313781", "title": "Lock picking", "text": "Lock picking is the art of opening a lock without the key and without damaging or destroying the lock or its door. It is usually used by locksmiths to let people back in who have lost their keys or locked them inside a car or house. Lock picking is very rarely used by criminals, because picking a lock is difficult and other ways of entering such as breaking a window are much easier. Some people pick their own locks as a hobby. In most places picking locks that you own is legal, but it is illegal to pick locks that you do not own or do not have permission to pick.\nHistory of keys and locks goes back for about 4,000 years.\u00a0Ancient people also wanted to protect their possessions and keep them in places where other people cannot get access to them. The first locks and keys were made of wood and other easily accessible materials and they provided the small safeguard against theft or break-in. However, such locks at least let the owners know if someone tried to tamper with the lock.\u00a0\nThe earliest known key and lock was discovered in the Nineveh ruins, which was the capital of ancient Assyria. They were dated to 704 BC. The first models of wooden locks and keys originate from Ancient Babylon and Egypt. These simple devices had small pins, controlling the movement of the security bolt. In order to unlock the bolt, it was necessary to lift the pins, by using bulky wooden keys.\u00a0\nRoman age introduced many improvements of the Egyptian wooden locks. Ancient Romans created stronger and smaller locks than Egyptians, by using bronze and iron. The keys of locks from Roman era were small and light enough to be carried everywhere. Such small keys were often viewed as one of the effective ways of showing your wealth to other people. Rich Romans often kept their valuable things in secure boxes and wore the keys as finger rings.\u00a0\nThe warded lock also comes from antiquity and is still the most recognizable lock and key type. Nowadays, there is a wide range of different locks, keys and other security systems available on the market. Among them are also keyless entry systems, that allow people to operate their locks without using the keys.\nMethods.\nWarded locks.\nWarded locks are the simplest locks to pick and are picked by inserting a warded lock pick (also called a skeleton key) into the keyhole and turning it as if it were the key. A pick for warded locks can be made by filing down all of the teeth on a regular key except the last one, or for some locks, the last two.\nPin-tumbler and wafer-tumbler locks.\nPin-tumbler and wafer-tumbler locks normally open when the correct key pushes all of the pins or wafers to the shear line. An incorrect key will push the pins or wafers too little or too far. These locks are more difficult to pick than warded locks and are picked by putting tension on the keyhole and pushing the pins or wafers up individually until they reach the shear line. When all of the pins have reached the shear line, the lock will turn as if the key were inserted. Other methods of raising the pins or wafers involve moving an S-shaped pick called a rake through the keyhole to vibrate the pins or wafers to the shear line, or using the pick gun, which bounces the pins to the shear line. It is also possible to pick a pin-tumbler lock with a bump key, which, when struck with a hammer, will bump the pins to the shear line. The force on the hammer should be slightly less than that used for driving a nail, because too much force will break off the head of the key, leaving the rest of the key stuck in the lock. Many newer locks have special pins that make picking more difficult. The special pins are usually spool-shaped and work by wedging into the shear line when pushed up by the pick.\nOther locks.\nMost padlocks can be opened by inserting a thin piece of metal called a shim between the shackle and the body of the lock. This will need to be done on both sides if there are locking levers on both sides. The shim pushes the locking latch aside and allows the lock to open. High-security padlocks often use a ball-bearing latch, which can not be pushed aside with a shim. Some door locks can be shimmed with a credit card or similar thin plastic object. The card is placed between the door and doorframe, which pushes the latch aside. Combination locks can not be picked, but it is often possible to find the combination by feeling for certain clicks inside the lock, except on certain high-security safe locks. Some combination locks have small cracks through which the parts inside the lock can be seen, allowing the combination to be determined. The Master Lock #175 brass combination lock has a very unique flaw allowing a small piece of metal to be inserted into the bottom of the lock, which pushes the locking bar aside, opening the lock. A special pick exists for disc-detainer locks, but it is only effective on inexpensive locks that do not have false gates. A well-made disc-detainer lock with false gates (such as the Abloy Protec) is considered almost impossible to pick. Lever locks are considered difficult, although possible, to pick and also require a special pick. Tubular locks can be picked with a special tubular pick. Some poorly-made tubular locks can be picked with an ordinary writing pen. Most car locks can be defeated by inserting a metal or plastic rod with a small hook on the end into the area between the rubber seal on the window and the car body, and using the hook to pull the lock lever that is normally pulled by hand from the inside of the car. On most cars, it is possible to electrically connect the switch contacts on the ignition lock to start the car without a key, completely bypassing the mechanical lock. This is called hotwiring the car. Most cars use a wafer-tumbler based lock, so it is also possible to pick the door or ignition locks the traditional way. Some cars, such as many Honda and BMW models, have electronic protection against both hotwiring and traditional picking."}

It features five-star hotels, such as The Dorchester, Grosvenor House Hotel and InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel, and showrooms for several makes of high-end sports car. The hotels are part of the area known as Mayfair.\nHistory.\nOriginally a country lane running north-south along what is now the eastern boundary of Hyde Park, it became a fashionable residential address from the eighteenth century onwards. It has views across Hyde Park and a position at the most fashionable western edge of London. It became lined with some of the largest privately owned mansions in London, including the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor House and the Holford family's Dorchester House (demolished in 1929 and replaced by 1931 with The Dorchester, which are now both hotels, and the Marquess of Londonderry's Londonderry House, which has been demolished. \nOn a corner with Oxford Street, Somerset House (No. 40), built in 1769-70, was successively the town house of Warren Hastings, a former Governor-General of India, the third Earl of Rosebery, and the Dukes of Somerset.\nIn the 1960s the Lane was widened to three lanes each way either side of a central reservation. This required the demolition of a number of houses at Hyde Park Corner. It claimed land previously in Hyde Park to make room for the multi-lane carriageway. The result was to diminish the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, as it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. It has little or none of the countryside atmosphere that once made it popular. The widening of the road distanced the houses on the east side of Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass."}

It is a creeping annual or perennial herb often grown for its curiosity value: the compound leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, re-opening minutes later. The species is native to South America and Central America, but is now a widespread weed.\nDescription.\nThe stem is erect in young plants, but becomes creeping or trailing with age. The leaves of the \"Mimosa pudica\" are compound leaves.\nThe leaves are bipinnately compound, with one or two pinnae pairs, and 10-26 leaflets per pinna. The round-shaped flower heads, which are inflorescences, are 8\u201310\u00a0mm in diameter (excluding the stamens). The floret petals are red in their upper part and the filaments are pink to lavender. The fruit consists of clusters of 2-8 pods from 1\u20132\u00a0cm long each. The pods break into 2-5 segments and contain pale brown seeds some 2.5\u00a0mm long. The flowers are pollinated by the wind and insects. The seeds have hard seed coats which restrict germination.\nPlant movement.\n\"Mimosa pudica\" is well known for its rapid plant movement.\nLike a number of other plant species, it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed \"sleep\". The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light.\nThe leaves also close when touched, warmed, blown, or shaken. When the plant is disturbed, specific regions on the stems release potassium ions which force water out of the cell vacuoles. The water diffuses out of the cells, producing a loss of cell pressure and cell collapse; this differential turgidity between different regions of cells results in the closing of the leaflets and the collapse of the leaf petiole. This is quite a common trait in the Mimosoideae subfamily of the legume family, Fabaceae. The stimulus can also be transmitted to neighbouring leaves. The function of this trait is not known. The plant may use its ability as a defense from predators. Animals may be afraid of a fast moving plant and would rather eat a less active one. Another possible explanation is that the sudden movement dislodges harmful insects.\nReferences.\n[change]"}

He became W\u0101li, and self-declared Khedive of Egypt and Sudan.\nThough not a modern nationalist, he was the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms he made to the army, economy, and culture of Egypt. He also ruled some Levantine territories outside Egypt. The dynasty he established ruled Egypt and Sudan until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\nMuhammed Ali was born in the Ottoman Empire, in the area which is now the Greek province of Macedonia. His Ancestors was from \u0130li\u00e7 a City in Asia Minor. He led a group of Albanian troops sent to Egypt. They were part of an Ottoman force that reoccupied Egypt after Napoleon's French troops left. The Ottomans had ruled Egypt by a Wali (Governor) with Mamluk troops. The Mamluks were former slaves.\nThe French Capitulation of Alexandria left a power vacuum in the Ottoman province. Mamluk power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power. During this period of anarchy Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to play both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself. As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. A group of prominent Egyptians demanded that the then W\u0101li, Ahmad Khurshid Pasha, step down and Muhammad Ali be installed as the new W\u0101li in 1805.\nThe Mamelukes were still powerful, so in 1811 he massacred their leaders and sent troops to chase the followers out of Egypt.\nReforming Egypt.\nMuhammad Ali\u2019s goal was to establish a powerful, European-style state. To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali\u2019s land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, and kept the surplus. This was very profitable for Egypt, especially with their cotton, which was of high quality. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.\nBeyond building a more modern economy, Muhammad Ali started to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising men to Europe to study. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. European education also provided talented Egyptians with social mobility. Bright boys from poor families could work their way up, and become successful.\nA byproduct of Muhammad Ali\u2019s training program was the establishment of a Civil service. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was needed for Muhammad Ali\u2019s other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the W\u0101li had to fill the posts that the Mamluks had previously filled. He divided Egypt into ten provinces, each leader responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order. Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\nHorse stud.\nHe loved Arabian horse, he build a very big Horsestud in Egypt at Shoubra, and from this Horses, they are descendants until today.\nMilitary campaigns.\nAt the start, Muhammad Ali waged war on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, in Arabia and Greece. Later, he came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.\nHis first military campaign was an expedition into the Arabian Peninsula. The holy cities of Mecca, and Medina had been captured by the House of Saud, who held a form of Islam called Wahhabism. Armed with their new religious zeal, the Muhammad ibn Saud began conquering parts of Arabia.\nWith the main Ottoman army busy in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to recapture the Arabian territories. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, Tosun Pasha, to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that recaptured Hejaz.p43-44 After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, Abdullah ibn Saud, was sent to Istanbul, and executed.p48\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns of his own design, beginning with the Sudan which he viewed as a valuable addition of territory, gold, and slaves. Sudan at the time had no real central authority and used primitive weaponry in its tribal infighting.\nIn 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail, south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.p51 Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance. Ultimately, Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the conquest of Sudan. Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the Nile in Ethiopia, and Uganda. His administration captured slaves from the Sudan, who were then made into a foot regiment of soldiers. Ali's harsh reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, led eventually to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammed Ahmed, in 1881.\nAs Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire faced ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The Greek rebellion against Ottoman rule began in 1821. The Ottoman army failed to put down the revolt, and ethnic violence spread as far as Constantinople. Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of Crete in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\nMuhammed Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, Ibrahim Pasha.p71. Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the Navarino, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington (1770\u20131851). Muhammad Ali suffered the loss of his competent, expensive navy. With its fleet destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy for no gains.\nTo compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the conquest of Syria was set in motion. Like other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control the Levant, both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources. Not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the Levant. It would be a captive market for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Perhaps best of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria started the First Turko-Egyptian War. The Egyptians overran most of Syria with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more to support his campaign, and his people resented the increased burden.\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into Anatolia. At the Battle of Konya (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali watched the European powers carefully. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, he continued the practice of using the Sultan\u2019s name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories. He continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.p111 So long as Muhammad Ali\u2019s march did not threaten the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained passive observers.\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant Abd\u00fclmecid. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid. This led to the Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi.p72 Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, so they worked for a negotiated solution. In May 1833 the Convention of Kutahya was signed.\nThe terms of the peace were that Muhammad Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of Crete and the Hejaz as compensation. Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W\u0101li of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.p122"}

He was also Elector of Hanover, which made him a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.\nDuring George's reign, he lost control of the United States of America. His two kingdoms, Great Britain and Ireland, were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Also during his reign, the British were at war with republican and Napoleon I's France. The Electorate of Hanover eventually became a Kingdom.\nGeorge suffered from periodic bouts of mental illness. One of them caused a crisis in 1788, and attempts were made to nominate his son George IV as regent. The king quickly recovered and prevented that from happening.\nGeorge signed the Quebec Act of 1774, which abolished William III's anti-Catholic laws in the American colonies. Also during his reign, George III signed legislation abolishing some of the anti-Catholic Laws in Great Britain and Ireland. For example, the Catholic Relief Acts of 1772 and 1774 allowed Roman Catholics to have land leases in Great Britain. In 1793, Hogart's Act allowed Roman Catholics to vote in Irish elections, but George blocked a proposal in 1800 to allow Catholics to sit in the British Parliament.\nIn the later part of his life, George suffered from recurrent mental illness, which was eventually permanent. Although it has since been suggested that he suffered from a genetic blood disease, porphyria, the cause of his illness is not certain. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.\nBecause of \"his plain, homely, thrifty manners and tastes\", George III has had the nickname of \"Farmer George\"."}

The song features American rapper and songwriter and producer Lupe Fiasco. The original track does not feature Fiasco's addition to the rap versus in the single. In January 2010, Stump announced that he was producing his debut solo album, titled \"Soul Punk\". This came after Fall Out Boy (his main band)'s hiatus in late 2009. His album is a complete solo effort as he is doing everything: performing, composing all music, penning all lyrics, playing over ten instruments and producing, with the album's recording is funded by his own Fall Out Boy earnings. Its musical direction is generally pop/R&amp;B orientated and has been described by Stump as \"soul punk\" and \"smart pop,\" drawing influence from a wide scope of artists including Prince, Michael Jackson and David Bowie. According to Stump, the song changed the entire course of \"Soul Punk\". \"I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with \"This City,\" I really loved the song but felt like, conceptually, it didn't fit on the album. I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much. So one of the holdups on [the album] was re-writing the record around [it].\" With \"Soul Punk\" originally due in February 2011, Stump delayed it to October 18 and rebuilt the album with the song, releasing \"Truant Wave\" EP in the meanwhile for its delay in February 2011. \"I had this feeling that the album was disjointed, and right before I was mastering, I played \"This City\" for my manager \u2014 I really liked it, but I was unsure about it, although I thought it was what I wanted to say \u2014 and he was like, 'Put it on, it's great! Then I thought, 'Well, if I'm going to put that on the record, then I really need to go back to the drawing board.' Basically I took \"This City\", \"Everybody Wants Somebody\", \"Allie\", and a song called \"Dance Miserable\", and rebuilt the album around those four songs.\"\nMusic video.\nA music video for the remix has been released, directed by Ken Koller.

Prior to that he Tweeted about the video in the making Twitter and a behind-the-scenes clip was reported by MTV on their website. The video features Stump dancing and performing the song in a room with flashing lights, projections and heavy use of special effects, alternating with brief grayscale flashes of a city. Despite not being available at first, Lupe Fiasco appears for one scene by himself. Stump and Koller made the video simplistic to let the music do the talking rather than the video.\n\"There's not really a plot, there's not really a story to it. The song's called 'This City,' and it describes a lot of these images in a city, and I feel like those images are already there; it would be kind of redundant to take a camera into a city; it's almost like the colors and the lights and the images that are going to be around this are going to be representing the life in a city. One thing that Ken and I were talking about is that a city is so complicated, so ... we wanted to do something a bit different with it, and a bit more abstract [...] the treatment was really funny to look at; it was literally one sentence, like 'Patrick stands in a room and sings and we project all these images and lights on the walls.'\"\u2014Stump, reported by MTV."}

Molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while fossil evidence suggest an early Tertiary radiation. Attempts made to bring together the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial.\nThe classification of modern birds is difficult. Sibley &amp; Ahlquist's \"Phylogeny and classification of birds\" (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds, though it is often debated and revised. Most evidence suggests that the modern bird orders are accurate taxa. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders."}

Predators, such as birds, lady beetles and lacewings, are free-living species that eat many prey during their lifetime. \nParasitoids are species whose larvae develop on or in a single insect host, ultimately killing or fatally infecting the host.

There are about 85 genera and (differing between sources) 1,300\u20132,000 species in this widespread group. However, in America and Europe, the two genera \"Chrysopa\" and \"Chrysoperla\" are very common.\nMost species of lacewings and their larvae are active predators, and are often used for biological control. \nMany adults of \"Chrysopa\" can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their thorax.\nThey have 'ears' at the base of their front wings. When they hear bat echolocation sounds, they close their wings and drop down. They can escape spider webs, because, being so light, they do not create much vibration to alert the spider. Instead of struggling like most insects, the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae. When it is stuck only by its wings, it become completely immobile. Slowly, the lacewing slides downwards out of the web. Tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky spider silk from touching the wings' surface. \nThe larvae are voracious, attacking other insects of suitable size, especially soft-bodied ones (aphids, caterpillars and other insect larvae, insect eggs). When they touch a potential prey object, the larva grasps it. Their maxillae are hollow, and inject a digestive secretion into the prey. The organs of an aphid can be dissolved by this in 90 seconds.

It is mainly used in Japan, but is also important in some other countries. The test started in 1977. The full name of the exam is the \"Test of English for International Communication\". The Educational Testing Service (ETS) writes and gives the test.\nOverview.\nThe Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) is meant to measure English skills in everyday workplace activities.\nTOEIC Listening &amp; Reading Test.\nThe TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading Test is a two-hour multiple-choice test. It has 200 questions. One hundred questions test listening comprehension, and the other 100 test reading comprehension.

The TOEIC certificate comes in five colors based on the scores:\nTOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing Test.\nETS began to offer the TOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing Test in 2006. Test takers get separate scores for each of the two tests. They can also take the Speaking test without taking the Writing test. The TOEIC Speaking Test takes about 20 minutes.

There are two ways to take the TOEIC test. One is the TOEIC Secure Program (SP), the other is the TOEIC Institutional Testing Program (ITP). The SP is offered at a set place and time, and test takers go there for the exam. In the ITP, a group such as a university gives the test when and where they like. Groups giving the ITP test must follow the test rules.\nTOEIC Scandal in Japan.\nThe Institute for International Business Communication had a scandal in 2009.\nThe IIBC\u2019s 92 year-old Chairman Yaeji Watanabe made his girlfriend's son Chairman of the IIBC Board of Directors. Watanabe forced out half the board of directors. Also, Watanabe only worked about one day a week. Watanabe's salary was more than 25 million yen each year. Watanabe said he was Chairman in name only and had little to do with choosing the new chairman. Then, Watanabe suddenly quit the IIBC. The son of his girlfriend was in charge of the non-profit company. The IIBC paid Watanabe 25 million yen for his retirement.\nThe IIBC lowered the price of the TOEIC Secure Program Test from 6,615 yen to 5,985 yen from September 13, 2009. Ministry of Trade asked the IIBC to lower the price because the test was making too much money.\nIIBC has a for-profit partner company called International Communications School (ICS). In July 2010, the Tokyo Tax Bureau announced that ICS lied about 100 million yen in income. ICS had to pay 30 million yen in taxes and fines.\nTOEIC in the Republic of Korea.\nSouth Korea is the second largest user of TOEIC by population. But, some major corporations have stopped using TOEIC scores for employment, or have required lower scores.\nFrom 2011, Korean universities were no longer allowed to use TOEIC and TOEFL scores as part of the selecting students. Seoul National University has developed another English proficiency test, TEPS. It may replace TOEIC.\nTOEIC in Europe.\nIn France, some Grandes \u00e9coles require a TOEIC score of at least 785 for a diploma. Some people think this is wrong because it means a diploma from a state school depends on a private corporation. The \"Commission des titres d'ing\u00e9nieur\" set the 785 score as similar to a B2+ level on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.\nStudent who cannot score 785 may have to show their English language ability in some other way. Some schools allow one more year after the end of studies to complete the diploma.\nIn Greece, TOEIC is accepted by ASEP as part of hiring new government workers.\nTOEIC is used by some universities in Italy. All universities require that students pass an English examination before entering a degree courses or receiving diplomas. Students usually need a TOEIC score of 600 to earn a diploma. Many universities allow other tests such as the Cambridge certificate and TOEFL.\nTOEIC Bridge.\nTOEIC Bridge is a simpler version of the TOEIC test. This test is for beginning and intermediate speakers. It has 100 multiple-choice questions. The test lasts about one hour."}

When the League of Nations demanded that Japan stop fighting, the Japan withdrew from the League on March 27, 1933.\nAs the Japanese army was under clear orders from Emperor Hirohito (who wanted a quick end to the fight with China) not to go into the Great Wall, the Japanese halted their attack in May 1933.\nTalks.\nOn May 22, 1933, Chinese and Japanese representatives met to talk the end of the fight. The Japanese demands were serious: a demilitarized zone covering one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall, from Beijing to Tianjin was to be set up, with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control. No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the zone, although the Japanese were allowed to use scout aircraft or ground patrols to check that the agreement was maintained. Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a police unit Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps. Furthermore, they forced China to recognise Manchukuo as a legitimate government. \nTwo secret clauses left out any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from this Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any problems that could not be fixed by the Peace Preservation Corps to be arranged by agreement between the Japanese and Chinese governments. Having lost every major battles and much territory, and with the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-shek more concerned with fighting the Chinese Communist Party than the Japanese, the Chinese government agreed to all demands. Furthermore, the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang.\nResult.\nThe Tanggu Truce resulted in the \"de facto\" recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomingtang government, and acceptance of the loss of Rehe. It brought a short end to the combat between China and Japan and for a brief period, relations between the two countries improved. On May 17, 1935, the Japanese legation in China was improved to the status of , and on June 10, 1935, the He-Umezu Agreement was concluded. The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang kai Shek time to merge his forces and to focus his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party, though at the cost of northern China. However, Chinese public opinion was opposing to truce so favorable to Japan and so shameful to China. Although the Truce set up a demilitarized buffer zone, Japanese territorial desires towards China remained, and the Truce proved to be only a short break until fightings broke out again with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937."}

Although the explosion was so weak that the rail was still usable, the Japanese army, blaming the action on the Chinese people, fully invaded Manchuria, leading to its occupation. Japan set up its puppet state of Manchukuo six months later. Soon the world knew the event, leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its withdrawal from the League of Nations."}

The action is moderated by the influence of the pre-frontal cortex. The system is a delicate balance between the need to satisfy urges from the most ancient parts of the brain, such as hunger, self-defence and sex, with the need to act in a way which is socially acceptable. \nThe precentral gyrus, forming the back of the frontal lobe, contains the primary motor cortex. This controls voluntary movements of specific body parts.\nEvolution.\nFor many years, many scientists thought that the frontal lobe was comparatively larger in humans than in other primates. They thought that this was an important feature of human evolution and was the main reason why human cognition is different from that of the other primates. \nHowever, this view has been challenged by later research. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to find the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all living ape species and several monkey species. The human frontal cortex is \"not\" relatively larger than the cortex in the other great apes, but it is relatively larger than the frontal cortex in the lesser apes and the monkeys."}

The first degree of an undergraduate degree is normally named a bachelor's degree. Therefore, for many subjects in many systems of education, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a bachelor's degree. This education usually takes place in a university. In the United States, a person starting at a university is known as undergraduate while students who have higher degrees are known as graduate students. In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a master's degree, for example in some science and engineering courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.\nDifferences in different places.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, it normally takes four or five years to complete an \"undergraduate\" degree. Students need to choose their main subjects before they join the university by taking a test named a \"vestibular\".\nEurope.\nUndergraduate degrees are not like in the United States where students have general studies during the first years and only specialize in a \"major\" during the last years of college. European students enroll in a specific course of studies they want to do from the start. They are expected to have received a good general education already in the secondary level in a school (like a gymnasium or lyc\u00e9e). In many countries they go to university at 18 or 17. The degree normally takes four or five years. After completing the first degree students can move on to doctoral studies. In many countries, the English distinction between a bachelor's and master's degree is only now being introduced by the Bologna process. This means that the old first degree would be approximately equal to a master's degree in the US or the UK.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, undergraduate normally means students studying to get a Bachelor's degree. It is also called an award. Getting a bachelor's degree normally takes three years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, it takes four years to obtain what is known as an \"ordinary\" degree, and five years to obtain a Scottish master's degree. Some undergraduates in England do a master's degree as their first degree in a similar manner to Scotland. The first three years are spent attaining a bachelor's degree and the last year includes research and more difficult subjects. In England, this is more common for degrees in science and engineering.\nThe only universities where it is possible to receive a master's degree without even attending the university beyond the award of the bachelor's degree are Oxford and Cambridge. Master's are generally awarded to Oxford and Cambridge graduates a year after they have graduated with bachelor's degrees.\nIreland.\nIn Ireland, undergraduate study is like in the United Kingdom. It is like this because undergraduate education was first taught the same in both countries. In Ireland, the undergraduate degree is closest to the Scottish type in the United Kingdom. They are four year undergraduate programmes.\nIndia.\nIn India, it takes 3 years to complete the undergraduate course (other than engineering, law and medicine). There are two types of undergraduate courses. Arts and Science is the first one which takes 3 years to complete the courses. Another one is Engineering, this will take 4 years to complete the courses (B.E/B.TECH).\nUnited States.\nIn the United States most undergraduate education is done at colleges or universities. Undergraduate education gives a bachelor's degree. This usually takes four years of study, although some courses take five years.\nIn the United States students in different years are often given different names:\nSome students choose to attend a community college or junior college for two years beforehand to further study at another college or university.\nMost universities also offer graduate study. Some institutions (e.g. liberal-arts colleges) only give undergraduate education or only give a small number another level of education. Getting an undergraduate degrees normally needs many courses to be completed. The courses have different subjects and different levels of difficulty. The academic discipline of the most number of subjects taken is called a \"major\" or concentration.\nUnlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as graduate study after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medicine has set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment. However, nursing is taught as an undergraduate program."}

A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated. \nSome fluids are anti-thixotropic: constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing. They are much less common.\nNatural examples.\nIt is a common experience walking on sand that in places it liquifies as one walks on it. This is a thixotropic response to pressure. In extremes, a quicksand may be danger to man and animals.\nSome clays are thixotropic, and their behaviour is of great importance in structural and geotechnical engineering. Landslides, such as those common in the cliffs around Lyme Regis, Dorset and in the Aberfan disaster in Wales are evidence of this. Similarly, a lahar is a mass of earth liquefied by a volcanic event, which rapidly solidifies once coming to rest. \nDrilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic. Honey from honey bees may also exhibit this property under certain conditions.(Heather honey). \nAnother example of a thixotropic fluid is the synovial fluid found in joints between some bones.\nSome clay deposits found in the process of exploring caves exhibit thixotropism: an initially solid-seeming mudbank will turn soupy and yield up moisture when dug into or otherwise disturbed. These clays were deposited in the past by low-velocity streams which tend to deposit fine-grained sediment.\nThese properties are often used in commercial products which are applied to surfaces, such as paint or toothpaste. With paint, the fluidity vanishes quickly and the surface sets permanently as water (or oil) evaporates."}

This is done in an airless furnace or oven (kiln) at temperatures as high as but usually around . This baking drives off volatile parts of the coal, such as water, gas, and tar.\nCoke is an almost pure form of carbon. The calorific value (heat energy produced when a fuel is burnt) of coke is about 56,000 kilojoules/kilogram.\nCoke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces iron oxide (hematite) to the iron product.\nAlthough coke is more expensive than coal, it can be used in households as a clean fuel, relatively free of smoke and impurities.

Weapons used for this are selective fire rifles. They usually have a bipod and a heavier barrel so that they can be used as light machine guns. SAWs usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles used by other people in the squad/section. This makes logistics easier because only one type of ammunition needs to be given to a unit. SAWs are light enough to be used by one man. However, heavy machine guns such as the Browning M2 are more powerful but need a crew to be as effective as they can be.\nOverview.\nMany SAWs (such as the RPK and L86) are just assault rifles or battle rifles that have been changed. They may be able to carry more ammunition and will almost always have a bipod. In the case of some assault rifles, such as the H&amp;K G36 or Steyr AUG, the SAW is simply the usual rifle with a few parts changed. However, the Austrian Army, who uses the most Steyr AUGs, doesn't use the HBAR (heavy barrel) version of the assault rifle. Instead, they use the MG 74, which is a gun which was made from the design of the German WW2-machine gun MG 42. One of the first weapons designed for this role was the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. Even though it could not carry many bullets in its magazine, it was still better than the usual infantry rifle."}
{"id": "314603", "revid": "917214", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314603", "title": "Sign (mathematics)", "text": "In mathematics, the word sign refers to the property of being positive or negative. Every real number that is non-zero is either positive or negative, and therefore has a sign. Zero itself is without a sign, or signless. In addition to putting signs into real numbers, the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity. Usually, if numbers are seen without a sign, they are seen as a positive number. Otherwise, a minus sign \"formula_1\" is appended before the number to indicate that the number is a negative of another number.\nThe word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs, such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign.\nSign of a number.\nA real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number. Zero itself is not considered to have a sign.\nIn arithmetic, the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number. For example, +3 would denote a positive 3, and \u22123 would denote a negative 3. When no plus or minus sign is given, the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive.\nThe sign of any number that is not zero can be changed to positive using the absolute value function. For example, the absolute value of \u22123 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3. In symbols, this would be written as |\u22123| = 3 and |3| = 3.\nSign of zero.\nThe number zero is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign. In arithmetic, +0 and \u22120 both mean the same number 0.\nMeanings of signs.\nBecause zero is neither positive nor negative, the following are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:\nThus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero. For example, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.\nThe same definition is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values. For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.\nSign of an angle.\nIn many texts, it is common to see a sign together with the measure of an angle, particularly a located angle or an angle of rotation. In such a situation, the sign says whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.\nIt is also possible to put a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented. Specifically, a right-handed turn around an axis usually counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.\nSign of a direction.\nIn arithmetic and physics, it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative. For a basic example, the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:\nOn the Cartesian plane, the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive \"x\"-direction, and upward being the positive \"y\"-direction.\nOther meanings.\nIn addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and other sciences:"}

At first, he supported the Corsica becoming a part of Italy, but then promoted the autonomy of Corsica after World War II.\nLife.\nRocca, called Petru in Corsican, was a gifted writer since young age. He contributed in Corsica to the magazine \"A Tramuntana\". During World War I, he wrote about the war and was decorated with the French Legion of Honor.\nFrom May 1920, Rocca worked with the literary magazine \"A Muvra\". During the first half of the 20th century, this was the most important Corsican publication in Italian. In 1922 he created the \"Partitu Corsu d'Azione\", following the model of the Italian Partito Sardo d'Azione of Sardinia that had autonomism ideals.\nAfter that, in the late 1920s, he created the \"Partito autonomista di Corsica\" with the support of Domenico Parlotti and Dr. Croce, director of the Archivi di Stato della Corsica.\nDuring the late 1930s Rocca, slowly changed his political opinions from wanting autonomy for Corsica to supporting the union of Corsica with Italy. He supported the ideals of Petru Giovacchini, an irredentist leader who created the main pro-Italian political organization in Corsica: the \"Gruppi d\u2019Azione Irredentista Corsa\".\nIn 1938, the French government punished him for his approach to the Italian Risorgimento ideals. They took away his French Legion of Honor medal. \"A Muvra\" started in 1939 to write articles against the Jews (responsible in Rocca's opinion for the French \"occupation\" of Corsica) and was quickly closed.\nDuring World War II, Rocca supported Benito Mussolini's ideals about the union of Corsica to the Kingdom of Italy. When Italian troops occupied the island in 1942, Rocca was proposed to be \"Governor\" of a Corsica united to Italy. After the Italian defeat in September 1943, he was harassed by the French authorities.\nAs a consequence of this in 1946 he was sentenced to 15 years of jail and sent to French Guiana. When released, he quickly recreated his original \"Partito autonomista di Corsica\".\nIn 1953, Rocca created an academy for the defense of the Corsican language. He demanded from France the recognition of the Corsican people and language and the creation of the University of Corte. Rocca was, until his death in 1966, a strong supporter of Corsican nationalism."}

The town lies in Lyme Bay, on the English Channel coast at the Dorset-Devon border. It is nicknamed 'The Pearl of Dorset'.\nThe town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast\u2013a World Heritage Site. The harbour wall, \"The Cobb\", features in Jane Austen's novel \"Persuasion\", and in the movie and novel, \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\", by local writer John Fowles.\nWhen people were counted in the town's most recent census in 2001, the population was 4,406. 45% of the town's population were retired people.\nGeology.\nThe town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast\u2013a World Heritage Site. The Jurassic Coast stretches over a distance of .\nThe coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the Earth's history. The localities along the Jurassic Coast include some important fossil zones.\nThe Blue Lias rock is host to a multitude of remains from the early Jurassic, a time from which good fossil records are rare. Many of the remains are well preserved, with complete specimens of several important species. Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were made in the area surrounding Lyme Regis, notably those discovered by Mary Anning (1799\u20131847). Significant finds include \"Ichthyosaur\", \"Plesiosaur\", \"Dimorphodon\", \"Scelidosaurus\", one of the first armoured (Thyreophora) dinosaurs. The town now holds an annual Mary Anning Day and Lyme Regis Fossil Festival. A fossil of the world's largest moth was discovered in 1966 at Lyme Regis.\nLandslips.\nThe coastal region near Lyme Regis is subject to large landslips. This means that Jurassic age fossils are regularly exposed and can be found on the beaches, but also causes devastation to the town.\nOne of the most spectacular landslips occurred on 24 December 1839, west along the coast in Devon belonging to Bindon Manor and known as \"The Dowlands Landslip\". About of fields growing wheat and turnips were dislodged when a great chasm was formed more than across, deep and long. The crops remained intact on the top of what became known as \"Goat Island\" among the newly formed gullies. On 3 February 1840, five weeks later, there was a second landslip nearby but much smaller than the former. This strange phenomenon attracted many visitors, and the canny farmers charged sixpence for entrance and held a grand reaping party when the wheat ripened. The area is now known as The Undercliff and is of great interest because of its diverse natural history.\nIn 2005, work began on a \u00a316 million engineering project to stabilise the cliffs and protect the town from coastal erosion. The town's main beach was reconstructed and re-opened on 1 July 2006.\nOn the evening of 6 May 2008, a section of land slipped onto the beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Local Police described the landslip as the \"worst for 100 years\"."}

It gives its name to a stage in the Upper Jurassic called the Kimmeridgian, lasting from 157.3\u2013152.1 million years ago.\nKimmeridge clay is perhaps the most economically important unit of rocks in the whole of Europe, because it is the major source for oil fields in the North Sea.\nThe clay is named after the village of Kimmeridge on the Dorset coast of England, where it is well exposed and forms part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. It exists across England, in a band stretching from Dorset in the south-west, north-east to East Anglia and Hull. The River Humber Bridge's foundations are in the Kimmeridge Clay deposits under the Humber estuary.\nThe fossil fauna of the Kimmeridge Clay includes a reptile fauna of turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs, as well as many invertebrate species such as \"Gryphaea\".\nClimate.\nThe Kimmeridge Clay was laid down in \nan environment which is not present on the Earth today. Much of Western Europe was covered by a high sea-level: this may be related to the opening of the Atlantic. As a consequence, the UK was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea, perhaps less than 100m deep, with occasional landmasses.\nThis was shallower water than the Blue Lias of the Lower Jurassic. It was often low in oxygen, which led to its organic material being only partially decomposed. The mudstones are organic-rich, and gave rise to most of the North Sea oil."}

The name Sungai Petani has its roots from \"sungai\" meaning river and \"petani\" meaning farmer in the Malay language. Sungai Petani in full means \"Farmer's River\", as there are a lot of paddy fields and farmers in the state. The word \"petani\" may also refer to \"Pattani\", a city in present-day Thailand to which the river was once connected. Even the old spelling of Sungai Petani was \"Sungei Patani\", without any reference to farming.\nPolitics.\nSungai Petani is designated as a parliamentary area in its own right. A total of 983,851 people (2008) are able to vote. It is currently represented by Johari Abdul from Parti Keadilan Rakyat.\nThe parliamentary area of Merbok and part of the parliamentary area of Yan (Gurun) form part of Sungai Petani Municipal administrative area.\nEconomy.\nSungai Petani has a high and medium-sized business community. Small and medium industry also play a part in the local economy, producing many products, from semiconductors to television tubes and from textile to wood products. Sungai Petani is also a booming business center with many large malls, franchise stores and business enclaves.\nSungai Petani has many malls and shopping centers such as Central Square, Village Mall, Lagenda Height Tesco, Sungai Petani North Tesco, Sungai Petani South Tesco, Giant Hypermarket, Econsave, Billion, Sp Plaza and Parkson.\nTransportation.\nThe town is accessible through the Federal Route 1 and also the North-South Expressway. Sungai Petani has two highway exits while the Federal Route I runs across the city. Apart from that, it also has a train station and a makeshift express bus hub that caters to any destination within Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.\nSungai Petani also has a relatively below average local bus service called City Liner, with air-conditioned red coaches.The express bus station not far from Sungai Petani Railway Station. The railway station is managed by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad.\nThe nearest airport is the Penang International Airport on Penang Island.

This archaeological area was the site of an ancient Hindu-Buddhist kingdom that ruled the region from the 4th century AD. There is also an archaeological museum here which is known as The Lembah Bujang Archaeological Museum. This museum displays more than 2,500 artifacts from Malaysia's earliest civilization that have been unearthed from the surrounding excavation sites. Gold, gems, ceramics, Hindu gods and beautiful Buddha stone statues dating from the third to 14th centuries are all on display, though its main feature is Chandi Bukit Batu Pahat, a reconstructed temple built to worship the Hindu god Shiva."}

Eleven states and two federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula while the remaining two states and one federal territory are on the island of Borneo.\nThe states and federal territories.\nMalaysia is a federation consisting of 13 states (\"Negeri\") and 3 federal territories (\"Wilayah Persekutuan\"). These are divided between the two regions of Malaysia, with 11 states and 2 federal territories on West Malaysia and the other 2 states and 1 federal territory in East Malaysia. \nGovernance.\nAs Malaysia is a federation, the governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, while the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. The specific responsibilities of the federal and the state governments are listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia. Theoretically, any matter not set out in the Ninth Schedule can be legislated on by the individual states. However, legal scholars generally view this as a \"pauper's bequest\" because of the large scope of the matters listed in the Ninth Schedule. The courts themselves have generally favoured a broad interpretation of the language of the Ninth Schedule, thus limiting the number of possible subjects not covered. The Ninth Schedule specifically lists the following matters as those that can only be legislated on by the states: land tenure, the Islamic religion, and local government.\nThe 13 states are based on historical Malay Kingdoms, and 9 of the 13 states, known as the Malay States, retain their royal families. The Federal King (titled \"Yang di-Pertuan Agong\") is elected (de facto rotated) among the nine rulers to serve a 5-year term. The nine \"Malay States\" have a hereditary Ruler as titular Head of state and an executive Chief Minister or \"Menteri Besar\" as politically responsible Head of government. The rulers of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu are styled Sultans (typically Islamic). Only Negeri Sembilan's elective ruler holds the rare, autochthonous Malay title of \"Yang di-Pertuan Besar\", whereas only the Ruler of Perlis is titled \"Raja\". Former British settlements and crown colonies of Penang and Malacca (both peninsular) and Sabah and Sarawak (both on Borneo) each have a federally appointed titular Governor (styled \"Yang di-Pertua Negeri\") and an executive Chief Minister or \"Ketua Menteri\".\nSabah and Sarawak have additional powers as part of the terms when they joined Malaysia, such as immigration controls. They have separate immigration policies and controls and a unique residency status. Passports are required even for Malaysians for travelling between these two states or between either state and Peninsular Malaysia, however Peninsular Malaysians who are on social/business visits up to three months are allowed to produce a MyKad or birth certificate and fill in a special form in lieu of a passport.\nEach state has a unicameral legislature called \"Dewan Undangan Negeri\" (\"DUN\", State Assembly). Members of DUN are elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on the population. The state leader of the majority party in DUN is usually appointed Chief Minister by the Ruler or Governor. The term of DUN members is five years unless the assembly is dissolved earlier by the Ruler or Governor on the advise of the Chief Minister. Usually, DUN of the states in Peninsular Malaysia are dissolved in conjunction with the dissolution of the federal parliament, in order to have state elections running concurrently with the parliamentary election. However, Rulers and Governors hold discretionary powers in dissolving the DUN.Each state sends two representatives to the \"Dewan Negara\" (Senate), the upper house of the federal parliament.\nThe Parliament of Malaysia is permitted to legislate on issues of land, Islamic religion and local government in order to provide for a uniform law between different states, or on the request of the state assembly concerned. The law in question must also be passed by the state assembly as well, except in the case of certain land law-related subjects. Non-Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated on at the federal level for the purpose of conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations. Each state is further divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into \"Divisions\".\nSingapore and Brunei.\n was a Malaysian state from the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 until it was expelled from the Federation on 9 August 1965.\n was invited to join the Federation but decided not to at the end due to several issues, such as the status of the Sultan within Malaysia, division of Bruneian oil royalties, and pressure from opposition groups which amounted to the Brunei Revolt."}

There have been attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations, along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing.\nThe physicist Enrico Fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950. A paper by Michael H. Hart in 1975 made scientists more curious and they began to study the question in more detail. This is why some people call it the Fermi\u2013Hart paradox. Other common names for the same phenomenon are \"Fermi's question\" (\"Where are they?\"), the \"Fermi Problem\", the \"Great Silence\", and \"silentium universi\" (Latin for \"the silence of the universe\"; the misspelling \"silencium universi\" is also common).\nWhy interstellar communication is difficult.\nSpace is deep.\nExtraterrestrial life might exist, but humans may not know about it. To send signals across long distances in our galaxy, and the universe, is difficult. This is because the power output needed to project the signal would be very large. Coherent (laser-like) signals travel at the speed of light, but our own galaxy is 100,000 light years across. Alien civilizations may not be able to detect the signal, or they may not understand the communication or the method used to communicate. \nSpace is dusty.\nSpace is full of dust clouds and magnetic fields, which would disturb or eliminate even a coherent (laser-like) beam of electromagnetic radiation. Thousands of tons of cosmic dust are thought to reach the Earth's surface every year. A signal would face much interference in any long-distance travel across space.\nIf it is difficult or impossible for us, it may also be difficult for other forms of life. As for other galaxies, the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years away. \nTime.\nIn our Galaxy, the time it takes for signals to travel is very large. Vast eras of time would pass before a reply could be received. There are theories about \"worm-holes\" in space in which communication could be sent through space more quickly, but these are just theories now. There is still a desire for space travel. Locally in the Solar System, the main goal is to get minerals which are scarce on Earth."}

Seneca often lived in the city of Rome. He died by suicide in year 65.\nDuring the reign of Roman emperor Claudius, Seneca was sent in exile to the island of Corsica for nine years. This act was caused by Messalina who was the wife of Claudius. In 49 AD Claudius married his own niece Agrippina, and she called Seneca back to Rome to be a tutor for her son Nero. Nero became emperor in 54 AD, and Seneca helped him to rule the Roman Empire for the next five years. After 59 AD, Nero became like a tyrant, and Seneca lost control over him. In 65 AD Nero accused Seneca of helping the people in the Pisonian conspiracy who wanted to kill Nero. Seneca was probably innocent, but Nero forced Seneca to kill himself.\nWritings.\nSeneca was a very famous writer. He wrote books on philosophy, and he also wrote plays. Most of his books still exist.\nHis philosophy books were about Stoicism. These books include his \"Letters to Lucilius\" and his \"Essays\" (or \"Dialogues\"). Seneca wanted to find the right way for people to be happy, so he wrote about ethics. He believed that some emotions, including anger and grief, are bad and should be avoided. He wrote about the shortness of life, and he wrote about favours, mercy, friendship, and the need to help other people.\nHis plays are tragedies.

Like the sun, a tanning bed can also cause a sunburn if the person stays in too long. There are many kinds of tanning beds, but most look like the one in the photo.\nHistory.\nTanning beds became popular in Europe and America because of the work of Friedrich Wolff around 1979. He patented his design and charged others to use his ideas. His company, \"Wolff Systems\" does not build the tanning beds, they research and design for the tanning lamp. Some of the early adopters of the Wolff technology include ETS, Inc., SCA, Sun Industries, Inc., Montego Bay, Sunal. Later, Friedrich sold Wolff Systems to his brother Jorg Wolff, who was the founder of Cosmedico, Ltd., another pioneer in the tanning industry.\nDesign.\nTanning beds use a special fluorescent lamps (16 to 32 per tanning bed) that creates visible light and ultraviolet light. Like all fluorescent lights, they use a ballast system to limit the electricity going to each lamp, which is most often 100 watts per lamp. The tanning beds use a special acrylic, or clear shield over the lamps. Most clear plastics will block ultraviolet, but this special type of plastic lets most of the ultraviolet light pass through. Most tanning beds also have a cooling fan system, to cool the electronics inside the tanning bed and keep it from getting too hot. All tanning beds have a timer, a device to limit the amount of time the person is exposed to the ultraviolet light. After a few minutes, the timer makes the bed turn off.\nBenefits and risks.\nLike the sun, tanning beds help your skin to produce vitamin D due to the exposure to the UV (ultraviolet light). Both the sun and tanning beds can damage your skin if you stay exposed for too long. Getting too much UV, or many sunburns can cause skin cancer, including melanoma, which can be deadly. There is a lot of controversy due to the risks. Most countries have many laws and rules that regulate tanning beds. It can give you burns. "}

It is located near the junction of the roads from Landsborough to Redbank, and from Frenchmans to St Arnaud. It is close to the western side of the St Arnaud Range National Park.\nThe area was first called the Navarre Diggings after gold was found in June 1859 by a group led by James Law (1827-1910). It was about six miles from the Navarre township. This caused a gold rush and there were soon about 700 people on the diggings. At the peak of the rush, there were over 6000 people in the area digging for gold.\nJames Law, who had come to Australia from Scotland, was given a reward of 150 pounds for being the first person to find gold. Other members of his group, John Fewster, W.R. Marshall and George Mill also were rewarded.\nThe name was changed to Barkly on 1 November 1861, after the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly. The name was changed by the local gold warden, Mr. Warden Alley, a government official in charge of the diggings. A school was started, the Barkly Common School.\nA cemetery, now called the Pioneer Cemetery, was begun close to the original diggings. The town of Barkly developed about two miles from this area, and a new cemetery was opened.\nBarkly has a small Anglican church, a hall, and a few houses. The school has been closed and the buildings removed. There is a rose and lavender farm which is open to the public during the year. A headstone was placed on James Law's grave on 5 May, 1985. In 1996 a memorial stone was placed at the site of the first gold discovery."}

Complete protection against all weapons is not possible.\nIt is usually made from two or more types of material, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex (bend) instead of shatter. There must be a clear view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches.\nA popular method is stick a special plastic film to the inner surface of ordinary glass. This 'security laminate' bonds to the glass with an adhesive. This gives a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass. Transparency is better, tint-free; thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50-70%. The laminate can be stuck on to existing windows; this a called a 'retrofit'.\nMethods.\nThe concept.\nThe plastic provides little bullet-resistance. Glass, much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet. The plastic deforms, absorbing energy and (perhaps) stopping the bullet. The ability of the plastic layer to stop projectiles is directly proportional to its thickness. Bulletproof glass may be up to three inches thick.\nThe materials.\nAll the parts of the glass must be transparent. The essential components are these:\nThe most usual method today requires three parts in layers:\nSimpler version.\nA simpler version is used for car windshields. It consists of two panels of toughened glass, bonded together with polyvinyl butyal (PVB). The PVB stops cracks in the outer glass from spreading.\nLatest ideas.\nOne-way.\nThe idea is for guards inside to be able to shoot out, while attackers can't shoot in. One-way bulletproof glass is usually made of only two layers, a brittle layer on the outside and a flexible one on the inside. A bullet fired from the outside hits the brittle layer first, shattering an area of it. This absorbs some of the bullet's kinetic energy, and spreads it on a larger area. When the slowed bullet hits the flexible layer, it is stopped.\nHowever, when a bullet is fired from the inside, it hits the flexible layer first. The bullet penetrates the flexible layer because its energy is focused on a smaller area; the brittle layer then shatters outward due to the flexing of the inner layer and does not significantly hinder the bullet's progress. A problem with this idea is that a two-layer glass has limited stopping power.\nImprovement on glass.\nThere is a new type of transparent armour with aluminium oxynitride instead of glass. As the outside 'strike plate' layer, it is much lighter and performs better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride 'glass' can defeat .50 caliber armour-piercing rounds. Various types of other materials which closely resemble glass are also being developed.\nCeramics.\nCertain types of ceramic can also be used for \"transparent\" armour. They are denser and harder than traditional glass. These new types of transparent ceramic armours make thinner armour with equal stopping power to traditional laminated glass."}

As a young boy (in Chicago), Drake loved electronics and chemistry. He says that he thought of life on other planets but never said the idea with his family or teachers.\nHe enrolled at Cornell University on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. Once there, he began studying astronomy. A lecture from astrophysist Otto Struve in 1951 strengthen Drake's ideas about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. After college, he served briefly as an electronics officer on the USS Albany. He then went on to graduate school at Harvard in radio astronomy.\nDrake's hobbies include lapidary and orchid cultivation.\nCareer.\nDrake started his career undertaking radio astronomical research at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, and for a short time in 1963 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He conducted key measurements which revealed the presence of a Jovian ionosphere and magnetosphere.\nIn 1960, he started Project Ozma, which searches for extraterrestrial life. Drake is one of the pioneers of the modern field of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence with Giuseppe Cocconi, Philip Morrison, Iosif Shklovsky, and Carl Sagan. \nDrake joined the Astronomy faculty of Cornell University in 1963. Drake lead the conversion of the Arecibo Observatory to a radio astronomical facility. He lead Arecibo's improvements in 1974 and 1996. As a researcher, Drake was involved in the early work on pulsars.

Lasting just 13 days, it is considered one of the shortest wars in history.\nDuring the war, Indian and Pakistani forces fought on the eastern and western fronts. The war effectively came to an end after the Eastern Command of the Pakistani Armed Forces signed the Instrument of Surrender (1971) on December 16, 1971. After the surrender, East Pakistan seceded as the independent state of Bangladesh. Around 97,368 West Pakistanis who were in East Pakistan at the time of its independence, including some 79,700 Pakistan Army soldiers and paramilitary personnel and 12,500 civilians, were taken as prisoners of war by India.\nWestern and Soviet involvement.\nThe Soviet Union sided with the Bangladeshis, and supported the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini during the war. The Soviets thought that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals\u2014the United States and China. The USSR gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures. This assurance was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty signed in August 1971.\nThe United States supported Pakistan politically and with supplies. President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a \"rapprochement\". Nixon was planning to visit China in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would give the Soviets control over the region. It would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. In order to demonstrate to China the \"bona fides\" of the United States as an ally, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan, routing them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the \"genocidal\" activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram. This prompted widespread criticism and condemnation both by Congress and in the international press.\nThe United States introduced a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan. It was vetoed by the Soviet Union. In the following days Nixon and Kissinger tried to get India to withdraw, but they did not succeed.\nPresident Nixon requested Iran and Jordan to send their F-86, F-104 and F-5 fighter jets in aid of Pakistan. \nWhen Pakistan's defeat in the eastern sector seemed certain, Nixon deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS \"Enterprise\" into the Bay of Bengal. The \"Enterprise\" and its escort ships arrived on station on 11 December 1971. According to a Russian documentary, the United Kingdom deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier HMS \"Eagle\" to the Bay.\nOn 6 December and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok; they trailed U.S. Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by USS \"Enterprise\" task force in the Indian Ocean."}

The density of air is about 1.275\u00a0mg/cm3, which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material.\nThe lightest material ever made was invented in 2011. It is made out of a microscopic micro-lattice of hollow tubes \u2013 a criss-cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes. The researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than Styrofoam and is very strong. The material is low density: it has a density of 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre. Silica aerogels, the world's lightest \"solid\" materials, are only as low as 1.0\u00a0mg per cubic cm. The metallic micro-lattices are 99.99% air and only 0.01% solid. The metal used is nickel.\nThe material is not just light: it has some elastic properties. When it is squashed, the little tubes are also squashed, but when the pressure is removed, they rebound. A sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98% when the pressure is lifted. That makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers: they are materials used to cushion against shock."}

VENONA was made to decrypt secret communications of Soviet intelligence agencies including NKVD, KGB and GRU. Decryption was possible because the encrypting one-time pads were reused.\nThe Venona project was most famous for the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case known as LIBERAL and it ended in both of them being executed. VENONA exposed other spies including Klaus Fuchs and Alger Hiss. \nIn July 1995, the first six documents were shown which included had 49 messages about the Soviets trying to get information on the United States atomic bomb and the Manhattan Project. In the next five more years, about 3,000 VENONA messages were made public."}

The spliceosomes govern alternative splicing.\nThe background to this is that, in eukaryotes, most genes code for a protein in separated strings of DNA. This is because, of a total gene, coding bits (exons) are separated by non-coding bits (introns). The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways. Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNAs, and these produce different proteins. Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing.\nThe two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it 'recognises' the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns. The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA: it acts both as an enzyme (catalyst) and builds structure.\nSnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz.\nThomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development."}

The boat was first created by (1820\u20131885) during the 1840s. Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic. He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain, but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions.\nHalkett's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber. This boat could be filled with air (inflated) to float on water or the air could be removed (deflated) so it would be smaller and lighter to carry. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak. The oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella. Next, he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack. When it was deflated, It could be used as a waterproof blanket.\nMany people who explored Canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people. He tried to show the Royal Navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed. He also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck. They were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats are still known to exist. One belonged to Orcadian explorer John Rae. The other is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.\nPeter Halkett.\nPeter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s. He was the son of John Halkett, a director of the Hudson's Bay Company who had lived in Canada for many years before returning to England. Peter Halkett was interested in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic for a long time. He was very interested in John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition of 1819\u20131822. This expedition had many problems.\nFranklin explored the northern coast of Canada for three years. He was looking for the Northwest Passage. His search ended very badly. It was said that people killed other members of the expedition and that some even ate the other people. 11 of the 20 members of the group were killed. The people that were not killed had to eat lichen, their own boots, and the remains of dead animals left by wolves. They had become stranded on the wrong side of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm. John Richardson tried to swim to safety. This caused him very bad hypothermia. One person in the party built a small canoe from canvas and willow. They had to cross the river one at a time using the canoe.\nHalkett was an amateur inventor. During his spare time while in the navy, he worked on building a boat that would be small and light enough to be carried through wilderness, but strong enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. He chose to build a boat in which all parts could also be used as clothing or items that the user would normally carry with them.\nBoat-cloak.\nHalkett made a waterproof cloak. It was created from an early form of Macintosh cloth. This cloth was made of cotton combined with India rubber. The inside of the cloak was an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid. It was made of four different airtight sections. If one section was damaged and could not hold air, the others would still keep the boat floating. The cloak had a pocket that held a paddle blade and a small bellows. The person wearing the cloak would carry a walking stick. This stick was also used as the handle for the paddle. There was also a large umbrella which was used as a sail for the boat. The cloak weighed about . It took three to four minutes to inflate the boat. Once the boat was inflated, it could carry six to eight people.\nIn early 1844, Halkett tested the first boat-cloak on the River Thames. He paddled it without taking on any water. His test went very well. Because of this, he took the boat-cloak with him while on naval service. He used it whenever he could to test it under many different sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett wanted to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions. The seas of the Bay of Biscay were usually very bad, but the weather was unusually calm when he got there. The boat-cloak was very well liked by explorers. John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819\u20131822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that \"Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely\".\nHalkett's boats in the Canadian Arctic.\nBecause of how well the boat-cloak did during his tests, Halkett built a larger version. This boat could be folted into a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men. Each man would use a paddle on each side of the boat. When deflated, the boat could be used as a waterproof blanket. This would allow the users to sleep on wet ground. The people in charge of the Royal Navy though the boat could be useful to some people but was not likely to be useful to the Navy. On 8 May 1845 Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that \"My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service\".\nAlthough the Navy saw no use for Halkett's boats in general naval service, this larger boat was liked very much by explorers. John Franklin bought one to take on the 1845 expedition. This expedition ended badly. All 129 men and their two ships were lost and never found. Franklin believed that Halkett boats were very needed to travel in Canada. He gave the boat that was to be used for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land so that Simpson could use in his travels in the region. He got another boat from Halkett to be used on his last expedition.\nOrkneyman John Rae, known by the Inuit as (, \"He who takes long strides\"), was a Hudson's Bay Company surgeon. He became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic. Unlike most Europeans of that time, Rae believed that the local people knew the best ways to deal with the very bad weather conditions. He travelled Inuit-style, using sledges and snowshoes. He slept in snow igloos. Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846. He said that it was \"most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at Repulse Bay\". He also said that \"although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair\" and \"ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition\".\nIn 1848, the Royal navy sent out people to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklin's expedition. The search party was led by John Richardson and John Rae. They had a Halkett boat bought by the government. The party did not find Franklin, but they learned that the Halkett boat very useful. During the search, they used the single boat to move their entire party across a river in 14 trips. Rae said that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, it was not hard to warm it to soften the material when needed. Halkett boats were also taken on 6 other expedition that were sent to look for Franklin. During these they were used for fishing.\nIn 1851 French explorer Joseph Ren\u00e9 Bellot led another expedition to find Franklin. This was paid for by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey. He said that it was \"of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft\". Bellot's expedition did not find Franklin. It was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (using with \"two beautiful Halkett boats\") found a group of Inuit who told them that they saw men dragging a boat four years earlier. Their bodies were found soon after that.\nCommercial failure.\nEven though the boats were said to be very good for lake-fishing and duck-shooting and were shown in the Great Exhibition of 1851, they did not sell well. Halkett's boat were not widely used except in the field of Canadian exploration. Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the building of his boats stopped. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall. Many years later it was found and is now in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second boat is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum."}

It is a group of igneous rocks which were formed during a massive igneous event starting about\u00a01,270 million years ago. The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in northwestern Ontario.\nMLIP is one of the largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces on Earth, as well as the world's largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain. This huge area of igneous rock was spewed out in a short time, geologically speaking. The MILP is much larger than other well-preserved large igneous provinces. The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum of . However, the Mackenzie dyke swarm itself occupies an area of at least , making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or the U.S. state of Alaska.\nThe Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by processes other than normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition, including basalt and gabbro.\nOrigins.\nLike most large igneous provinces, the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by a mantle plume\u2014an upwelling zone of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle. As the head of the Mackenzie plume reached the Earth's lithosphere, it spread out and melted catastrophically to form large volumes of basaltic magma. This resulted in the creation of a stationary volcanic zone west of Victoria Island, called the Mackenzie hotspot.\nCoppermine River Group.\nThe Coppermine River Group is a sequence of Mesoproterozoic continental flood basalts forming part of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. It is one of the largest flood basalt provinces on Earth, covering the area with a volume of approximately .\nBetween 1,200\u00a0and 740\u00a0million years ago, a series of flood basalt eruptions took place. At the northern portion of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province, vast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large part of the northwestern Canadian Shield. This constructed a large lava plateau with an area of , a volume of lavas of at least 500,000 km3 (120,000 cubic miles). \nThis extensive area of flood basalt lava flows has been called the Coppermine River flood basalts. With an area of and a volume of 650,000 km3 (120,000 cubic miles), the Coppermine River flood basalt sequence is larger than the Columbia River Basalt Group in the United States. It compares in size to the Deccan Traps in west-central India. This makes the Coppermine River flood basalts one of the largest flood basalt events ever to appear on the North American continent, as well as on Earth. The maximum thickness of the Coppermine River flood basalts is and has 150\u00a0lava flows, each to thick.\nThe Coppermine River flood basalts occurred shortly after a period of crustal uplift. The uplift then collapsed. This sudden uplift was likely caused by rising magma of the Mackenzie plume, which caused the Mackenzie hotspot. The Coppermine River basalts show over 100\u00a0individual lava flows."}

In July 1455 Giorgio bought home from a local nobleman Simeonich, where he engraved his family's heraldic symbol - a bear. When signing contracts, Giorgio often used his art name Georgius Dalmaticus, Sixty five years after his death, his grandson, Giacomo, an advocate by vocation, was recognized as a descendant of the noble House of Orsini. Giorgio's and Elizabetta's daughter Flavia married another Dalmatian painter, Giorgio Culinovich (Schiavone) in the year of 1463. Other source claims that the Orsinis' daughter's name was Elena (who married Schiavone).\nArt work.\nIn Venice, in 1441, Giorgio was invited to Sebenico to replace Messer Antonio di Pietro Paolo who had fallen into disrepute with the building committee of the cathedral of Sebenico. Antonio commenced the Cathedral building in 1431. Giorgio abandoned the Gothic style based ideas of his predecessor and followed revolutionary ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture, The whole cathedral building is roofed with wagon vaults, made of huge slabs of marble supported on strong transverse ribs, the same stone covering forming the ceiling inside and the roof outside. He was the chief cathedral architect from 1441 to 1473. From July 1, 1477 the work was continued by another architect, Niccol\u00f2 di Giovanni da Firenze. In 1444 Giorgio went to Spalato to build the chapel of S. Ranier in the church of S. Benedetto. The work was finished in two years. He came back to Spalato in 1448 to make the chapel of S. Anastasius in the cathedral.\nOrsini did not follow always the Renaissance. There are also several fine late Ancona Gothic buildings, among them the facade of S. Francesco and S. Agostino churches, the build of Palazzo Benincasa, all done by Giorgio Orsini. Work on S. Agostino facade was finished in 1455. On the S. Agostino facade, Orsini worked between 1455 and 1459. On the Loggia dei Mercanti, which was built by Giovanni Pace in 1443, the facade, with statues representing the virtues, is the work of Giorgio Orsini (1451-9) In 1460, Giorgio returned to Sebenico. In 1464 and 1465 he was at Ragusa, where he helped in building the Torre Menze, and in restoring the palace of the Rectors. The Palace of Rectors was badly damaged by the 1462 earthquake. Orsini replaced the tree central capitals, who were damaged beyond repair, of that building. The next year he was at Pago (today Pag, Croatia), improving and enlarging the courtyard of the bishop's palace. The design and work on facade of the cathedral at Ossero belongs to him, too. In the next year he undertook work on the facade of the Cappella Grande of the parish church at Pago. In 1470 he went to Rome, where his compatriot Giovanni Dalmato, the sculptor, of Trau (today Trogir, Croatia), was at work on the monument of Paul II. In 1472 he commenced the facade of S. Maria, Cittanova, in the Marche.\nHe had many pupils, some of whom continued to work on the cathedral at Sebenico after his death in 1475.\n\"Juraj Dalmatinac\".\nIn Croatia, Giorgio Orsini is celebrated as a Croatian sculptor and architect, known under the Croatian name \"Juraj Dalmatinac\". This name is translation of his art name \"Georgius Dalmaticus\". The translation is coming from the second half of 19th century. Another version of the Orsini's croatised name is \"Juraj Matejevi\u0107\". This name comes as translation of the \"Georgvs Mathei\" (Georg, Mathew's son) text engraved in the marble of St. Jacob cathedral church in Sebenico. Croatian author Fiskovi\u0107 claims that \"Orsini\", as his family name, was never used by the artist and it was adopted by his son, after the death of his father. His claim is not supported by any documents or records dated back to the times Orsini lived and worked. Fiskovi\u0107's claim is defeated by the home sale contract where Giorgio Orsini was named as the home buyer. Two Italian authors recorded the use of Giorgio's family name by his son Mateo and grandson Giovanni and refuted Fiskovic\nCroats erected a monument celebrating Orsini in the front of St. Jacob cathedral church in \u0160ibenik, Croatia. This monument, an over-sized standing statue of Orsini, is a work of Yugoslav sculptor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107. Two elementary schools in Croatia bear that name: one in Pag, and one in \u0160ibenik."}

He was \"an important contributor to the \"Golden age\" of Pakistani movie music.\" Rushdi is acclaimed as one of the greatest singers ever lived in south Asia. He is considered to be one of the most famous and versatile singers of the subcontinent. He is also considered to be the first regular pop singer of south Asia. and credited as having sung the \"first-ever South asian\" pop song. In 1954, he recorded the official National anthem of Pakistan with several other singers. Rushdi has recorded the highest number of movie songs in the history of \"Pakistani cinema\" in many languages. He suffered from poor health during the latter part of his life and died of a heart attack at the age of 48, after recording approximately five thousand movie songs for 583 released movies. Besides popular music, Rushdi also helped popularize the ghazals of Naseer Turabi. In 2003, 20 years after his death, Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf awarded him the \"Sitara-e-Imtiaz\".\nPopularity.\nMany of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained singers, although Rushdi never had any influences from any classical singer. He is famously known as \"Magician of voice\" and his popularity also turned traditional classical singers against him but did not affect his fame and his death is termed as irreparable loss to the industry. Actor \"Waheed Murad\" declared Rushdi's song, \"Bhooli hui hoon daastan\", his favorite song. Music directors like M.Ashraf and Nisar Bazmi also hold centaury partnerships with Ahmed Rushdi and they have composed hundreds of songs for him. According to complete songography, M.Ashraf composed 734 songs in 211 movies for Rushdi but available figures indicate a composition of 132 songs in 100 movies for him. The first movie of this pair was \"Speran\" in 1961 and the last was \"Hero\" in 1983. Ahmed Rushdi influenced many singers in music industry.\nDeath.\nSince 1976, Ahmed Rushdi was a heart patient and his doctors advised him to abstain from singing but Rushdi refused by saying that music was his life. When he had a second heart attack in 1981, he was composing a musical album in the voice of singer \"Mujeeb Aalam\". On the night of April 11, 1983, he had a third heart attack. He was immediately taken to the hospital but pronounced dead by the doctors. He was 48. Rushdi was buried at Sakhi Hassan Graveyard, Karachi. His last non movie song was \"Aaney walo suno\" which was a duet with \"Mehnaz\".\nAwards.\nNigar Awards"}

Floorball is usually played in gyms with little plastic balls and special hockey sticks. In floorball, there are basically five players with sticks and a goalkeeper without any special equipment. The goalkeeper has only special jersey and helmet. Floorball is very popular today.\nFloorball was invented in the USA, but has been most popular in Sweden since the 1970s. Its popularity quickly spread to Finland and Switzerland, but with different rules. For example, in Switzerland a goalkeeper was allowed to use a stick. In 1986, the International Floorball Federation (IFF) was founded and rules became the same.\nFloorball is played in a gym on an area of 40x20 meters bordered by boards 50 centimetres high. The formations are very similar to ice hockey. Both teams play with 3 attackers, 2 defenders and a goalkeeper. They can relieve whenever they want. Floorball is usually played 3x20 minutes with 15 minutes breaks. This is only for men and women. In juniors matches the time is different. Floorball is a contact sport so players can play with their body, but it has limits. The goalkeeper is not allowed to use a stick, but he can handle the ball with his body. The field players cannot hit the ball with their hands or head and they cannot jump. The goalkeeper can hit the ball with every part of his body and he can hold it for 3 seconds. In floorball, a player can be excluded for 2 minutes when he breaks the rules.\nThe currently strongest leagues are located in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.\nIFF organises world championships in floorball. Every year they are in a different country and it's also alternating between the mens and the womens tournament."}

In those works a character uses many tricks, including turning the gas lamps lower than normal, to convince his spouse that she is crazy. Since then, the phrase has become a common expression which has also been used in clinical and research literature."}

Users can use them to hand-draw images, graphics or handwriting as if they were drawing on a piece of paper. They use a pointing device, most often a stylus.\nGraphics tablets are one way of \"digitizing\" a physical piece of artwork. Instead of using hardware like scanners, one can simply trace an image from a piece of paper and it will be recreated on the screen.\nAnother thing that graphics tablets can do is handwriting recognition, which is popular in East Asia as a quick way to enter Chinese characters into an application.\nParts.\nSurface: A tablet has a flat surface on which the user can draw. This surface can be of different sizes or shapes, most often a square. Images drawn on a \"graphics tablet\" are most often not shown on the surface itself but can only be seen on a screen. However, there are special \"graphics tablets\" which allow the user to see their input right on the drawing surface. These hybrids are combination of a graphics tablet and a screen. Graphics tablets often have features like \"pressure sensitivity\" or \"stylus hovering\" that most touchscreens lack\".\"\nStylus: A stylus is a pen-like device that is used to give the tablet its input. It is also used to detect different amounts of pressure, often for use in a drawing program to change line thickness or color density. \nPuck: After stylus, pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. Professional pucks often have a loupe for greater precision.\nTypes.\nPassive tablets use electromagnetic induction technology. The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by a circuit in the stylus. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the stylus to read its position. The stylus does not require a battery for this.\nActive tablets use self-powered electronics that generate and send a signal to the tablet. These graphics tablets may listen for pen signals constantly, reducing inaccuracies in the reading of user input. This type of stylus often requires a battery, making it larger and heavier.\nOptical tablets operate by a very small digital camera in the stylus.\nAcoustic tablets are early models of \"graphics tablets\". A small sound generator is mounted in the stylus and the sound is picked up by two microphones placed near the surface.\nCapacitive tablets work by detecting \"electrostatic\" or \"capacitive\" signals by a stylus or human. Capacitive touchscreens are most often used in smartphones and tablet computers, making them the most well known type of input device next to a computer mouse. However, these are rarely used in graphics tablets as the lack of precision and many other features make them less useful. \nUses.\nBecause a stylus can be used to measure pressure, tilting and other factors, it is useful for use in digital art (especially two dimensional). These factors can be used to change brush size, opacity, shape, color and more in certain graphic programs depending on the input. Graphics tablets are often used for technical drawing and computer-aided design as well as for digital drawing, graphic design, sketches and much more.\nThey are also used for online teaching, e.g. live tutorials or lessons where visual information is needed. Some users prefer tablet computers for some purposes, though those devices often lack sensors for pressure and tilt.\nWhen it comes to buying a drawing tablet, you have two options either you can buy a drawing tablet with screen or one without screen. Drawing tablets with screen are way costlier than screenless tablets."}

The word is now used to describe the large pre-Roman towns that existed across Western and Central Europe. Many oppida grew from hill forts, but not all of them had an important defensive role. The main features of the oppida are:\nThe development of oppida was an important step in the urbanisation of Europe. They were the first large settlements north of the Mediterranean that could be described as towns. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida, but that they were not all of equal importance. This suggests that there was some form of hierarchy.\nIn conquered lands, the Romans took over the oppida to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.\nOne of the best preserved oppida is at Enserune in France. It was occupied continuously from 6th century BC until the 1st century. Other oppida are now buried beneath large cities, such as Vindobona which is covered by Vienna."}

When a substance is heated, its basic particles move around more quickly and by doing so generally maintain a greater average . Materials that contract with an increase in temperature are very uncommon; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges. The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature. \nThermometers are an example of using thermal expansion. They contain a liquid which can only move in one direction (along the tube) when volume changes along with temperature.\nThermal expansion can become a problem for trains because it can cause the rails to buckle. On the rails they will have monitors so that if it does get abnormally high in temperature they can be warned and trains could be told to slow down to reduce the heat of friction. Sometimes on the inner parts of the rails they will be painted white to reflect the sun's hot rays so that it won't cause buckling."}

Algal blooms may occur in fresh water as well as salt water. Algal bloom concentrations may reach millions of cells per milliliter of water. Algal blooms are often green, but they can also be other colors such as yellow-brown or red, depending on the species of algae. So-called algal blooms are often caused by Cyanobacteria such as \"Aphanizomenon flosaquae\", which are no longer considered to be algae. Some kinds of algal blooms, such as red tides, are poisonous.\nAlgal blooms are often caused by eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when abnormal amount of nutrients, especially phosphorous and nitrogen, enter a body of water. Algal blooms are a big problem to ecosystems because, like any sudden unnatural growth, it harms the other animals in that ecosystem, usually decreasing their numbers quickly. The abundance of algae in algal blooms causes layers of algae that are unable to get sunlight, and this causes the algae to die and start to decompose. The top layers of algae is able to photosynthesize and continue living. The lack of nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the water inhibits other life. Fish become unable to breathe and other aquatic vegetation cannot photosynthesize. All the organisms in the water start to die and decompose. The decomposition of the dead organisms use up most of the remaining dissolved oxygen in the water. Without a sufficient amount of nutrients and dissolved oxygen all living organisms in the water die which leads to a dead zone."}

He was the first person to make a telegraph with only one wire, and also helped come up with the idea of Morse code.\nSince the 1700s, there were different types of telegraphs being made, but they were hard to use because they had several wires. (The first telegraph ever built had 26 wires, which made it almost impossible to use.) Morse spent years trying to build one with only one wire, and managed to do it in 1836. Morse and his assistant made a code with \"dots and \"dashes\", which were two different types of \"clicks\" on the telegraph.\nMorse's invention made it possible to quickly communicate with people far away, and many telegraph lines were built. A telegraph line using his invention was built between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in 1844. By the 1860s, there were telegraph lines all around North America, and in 1866, a telegraph line was built across the Atlantic Ocean.\nLife.\nSamuel F. B. Morse was born in\u00a0Charlestown, Massachusetts\nMorse was a painter before he was an inventor. He was a professor of art at New York University. He wanted to do some paintings that were going to be done at the United States Capitol, but was not chosen to do them. He was so disappointed that he gave up painting.\nMorse was a devout Christian. The first message he sent on his 1844 telegraph line was \"What hath God wrought?\", which comes from the Book of Numbers in the Bible.\nHe died in New York City on April 2, 1872."}

He is best known for his improv and co-production work on the American and British versions of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" and the role of Lewis Kiniski on \"The Drew Carey Show\". He played Herb Melnick on the CBS comedy \"Two and a Half Men\" and was a performer on the show \"Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza\".\nEarly life and career.\nStiles was born in Seattle, Washington, the youngest of five children. His father, Sonny, was a fishing plant supervisor. Stiles lived in Vancouver, British Columbia as a teenager. At the age of seventeen, he dropped out of his high school, Richmond Secondary, to have a career in comedy. He worked in his father's fish-processing plant to earn a living. He then began performing improv with Vancouver TheatreSports League. In 1986, Stiles successfully auditioned for a berth at Toronto's renowned Second City comedy ensemble.\nTelevision work.\nBy 1989, the producers of the comedy show, \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", noticed his work. Stiles was a regular guest on the show until 1998, and the show's short production season allowed him to make numerous television and motion picture appearances in the United States.\nIn 1995, Stiles was asked by American comic Drew Carey to be a regular on his comedy \"The Drew Carey Show\". Stiles played Drew's smart but under best friend, Lewis Kiniski. Stiles' first line in the first episode of the show, \"And that's why the French don't wash,\" is a line he had used in an episode of the British version of \"Whose Line?\".\n\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\".\nIn 1998, Carey successfully got ABC to get an American version of \"Whose Line?\" produced. Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey as executive producers. Stiles and Colin Mochrie were the only two actors to appear in every episode of the US version, though Wayne Brady also became a regular near the beginning of the second season. The series was produced until 2006.\nStiles was the most iconic performer on the original UK version of \"Whose Line?\", appearing in 76 of the series 136 episodes (including compilations). He first appeared in the fifth episode of the second season, which aired in late 1988. He appeared in one other episode of that season, before returning for four episodes of the third season. His prominence increased with each season, including appearances in every episode of Season 4 which was filmed in New York; ultimately appearing in every episode from the seventh season onwards.\nStiles was known for several recurring impressions he performed on the shows, performed both at his own decision and as an assignment in games. These included Carol Channing, Elvis Presley, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Steve Irwin and Christopher Lloyd's character in \"Taxi\", Jim Ignatowski. He made clear his dislike of the musical segments of the show at every opportunity whenever he was chosen to perform in them, mostly because of his inability to form lyrics quickly. In particular, he disliked the games Hoedown and Irish Drinking Song, often reacting negatively (or sarcastically positively) to its being announced. Other than in early UK playings, Stiles was always the last performer to sing in Hoedown and other similar musical games, allowing him more time to devise lyrics, and giving him the final punch-lines, as well as injecting (usually not-so subtle) jabs at the Hoedown itself, or of the host for having him perform in it.\nStiles had first met Colin Mochrie years before while performing stand-up. They first performed together in Vancouver TheaterSports then in Second City, Toronto.There were a number of games which paired Mochrie and Stiles at every playing. Though other performers did so, he was the most common performer to make bald jokes at Mochrie. In return, Mochrie often made jokes about Stiles's height, nose, attractiveness, and tendency to wear exotic, flamboyant shoes, which were designed by George Esquivel. However, he would sometimes stand up to or make jokes at the other performers (including Drew Carey) who made fun of Mochrie's baldness or Mochrie in general, mostly during Scenes From A Hat.\nStiles received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 2002 for his work on the show.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1981, Stiles met Patricia McDonald at Punchlines where she was waitressing. They lived together for seven years before marrying in 1988. They have three children: Sam, Mackenzie, and Claire. When not working in Hollywood, he lives at his home on Lake Sammamish, outside Bellingham, Washington, where he has opened the Upfront Theatre, a small theatre dedicated to live improv comedy.\nStiles once lived in a house previously owned by Liberace in Sherman Oaks, California, but he sold it.\nOther appearances.\nStiles appeared in the 1991 film \"Hot Shots\" as Mailman Farnham, and also starred in the 1993 sequel (follow-up) \"Hot Shots! Part Deux\", as marine Rabinowitz.\nSince 2004, Stiles has been seen as the reappearing character Dr. Herb Melnick in several episodes of the comedy \"Two and a Half Men\" which stars his \"Hot Shots\" co-star Jon Cryer and formerly Charlie Sheen. Stiles also made short guest appearances on \"Murphy Brown\", \"Mad About You\", \"Mad TV\", and \"Dharma &amp; Greg\". In July 2008, he was a guest star on \"Reno 911!\" as Sergeant Clift, an acting coach.\nDuring the 1994 Major League Baseball strike Stiles appeared in several commercials for Nike, hanging out in an empty ballpark doing things such as playing the organ and attempting to do the wave alone. The commercials ended with the tag line: \"Play ball. Please.\""}

As of 2 October 2006, there were 747 people living there.\nDescription.\nVillage Ratibo\u0159sk\u00e9 Hory is 9 miles northeast of Tabor in the direction of Kutna Hora.\nThe village currently has about 740 inhabitants and consists of five parts - Ratibo\u0159sk\u00e9 Hory, Vresce, Dub, Podoli and Ratiborice. There already begins Moravian Highlands with the occurrence of minerals and ores containing silver.\nIn 1526 King Louis Jagelonsky granted brothers Medencum of Ratiborice and Podoli right to extract minerals in a half miles in circumference around Ratiborice. The king reserved the preferential right to purchase precious metals, gold and lot for two stacks and talent of silver for three and a half stack.\nThis privilege started extensive mining activity area Ratiborice, which enriched the local landscape of picturesque islands heaps especially with forest vegetation. It is these heaps, vivid evidence of mining, are a wonderful adornment of the landscape, we can observe the dominant height, from Adam's Hill, whose summit is at an altitude of 611 meters, or from the top of the loaf, which is above the natural park Polanka and its altitude is 666 m.\nThrough this cycle, called the results \"silver eight\" that showcases the very beautiful natural scenery with twelve ponds that are surrounded by meadow vegetation in protected plants - such as \"Menyanthes trifoliata\" which is an herb that has known its share in it drink, which has a great success both at home and abroad and is known for Becherovka.\nFrom cultural attractions dominate renovated churches St. Bartholomew in Ratiborice and St. Adalbert in Ratiborske Hory.\nThe development of the municipality contributes to school, post office, health center, public library, grocery store and last but not least, the local association Sokol, volunteer firefighters, SK Ratiborske Hory and hunting associations.\nTourists, who can also use the regular bus lines from the district town, offering a pleasant rest and two restaurants on the square of Ratiborske Hory.\nHistory.\nThe town Ratibo\u0159sk\u00e9 Hory (Bergstadtl), founded four hundred eighty years ago in the northeast of Tabor, was for several centuries dependent on mining.\nThe boom in mining caused a much greater concentration of population in Ratibo\u0159sk\u00e9 Hory than the corresponding options of agricultural production in the town and its surroundings.\nFundamental change in character fit in well with the renewal of mining in the district of Ratiborice sometime early 16 century. Already from 1515, was preserved record of the smelting of silver ore from Ratiborice and Vresce in Rosenberg's steelworks in the Czech Krumlov.

The sport normally takes place on water that is moving very slowly or not moving at all. The goal of the sport is to move the canoe a given distance in the shortest time. This sport is an Olympic event. At one time, wooden boats were used for racing. Over time, people started using boats made of carbon fibers. These boats are lighter and tougher than wooden boats.\nClasses.\nThere are two main types of races. These are canoe (C1, C2, C4) and kayak (K1, K2, K4). The number tells how many people are on the boat. In a kayak, a person sits. In a canoe, a person kneels on one knee. A kayak has a rudder. It is used to steer the boat. A canoeist (person who uses a canoe) uses the paddle to move the boat. This is done by moving the paddle from the bow to the stern (front to back). After each race, the boats are looked at to make certain they are legal. If a boat does not have enough weight, the racer is disqualified and cannot win the race.\nRaces.\nRaces are divided into several groups based on how long they are.\nShort distance.\nIn short distance races, the races are either 200\u00a0m, 500\u00a0m or 1000\u00a0m long. The path of the race is laid out using buoys. Each person has a separate path to follow from the starting line to the finish. On longer races, there may be a point where the paths cross each other to let the person turn their boat.\nLong distance and marathon.\nLong distance races are 5000\u00a0m long. Marathon races are at least 15\u00a0km. Men's marathon has a minimum length of 20\u00a0km. Women's marathon has a minimum of 15\u00a0km. Most major races are 30\u00a0km or longer. There is no maximum distance for marathon races. There is a marathon race that is about 1000\u00a0km long on in the Yukon. The longer races are usually broken up into several parts and may be raced over several days. In long distance and marathon races, all racers start at the same time. They do not use \"intervals\" where the racers are started at different times."}

Players use a receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide or look for containers, called \"geocaches\" or \"caches\".\nOne of the main ideas of geocaching is putting caches in places that are interesting, but not often visited by tourists. In the listing of the cache, information about the places is given.\nAfter 19 years of activity there are over 3,000,000 active geocaches. There are over 5 million geocachers worldwide.\nHistory.\nGeocaching was invented shortly after the removal of artificial error from GPS on May 2, 2000. Accuracy of the GPS before this date was about 100m, after this date is less than 3m. Improved accuracy allowed geocachers to specify where caches are located.\nThe first cache was placed on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek. It was found by Mike Teague of Vancouver on May 6, 2000. The original name of the game is \"GPS Stash Hunt\", but it was changed on May 30, 2000 after the discussion of several players to \"Geocaching\". \nCache.\nThe cache is usually in a waterproof plastic container with a logbook where geocachers write their registered nickname and date they find it. Larger containers usually contain items for trading like plastic toys, hockey cards or special trackable items called Travel Bugs or Geocoins. Trackable items are logged on the website and moved from cache to cache.\nThe coordinates of a hidden cache with the rating of the difficulty and terrain and information about size are placed by owner at the official website Geocaching.com. After checking by a reviewer, they are published and available for other geocachers.\nTypes of caches.\nTraditional cache: The basic cache type, hidden on the place defined by coordinates in header of listing.\nMulti cache: The geocacher usually has to go over the stages, find some information at every stage (such as number on information board etc.) and at the finish calculate the coordinates of the final cache.\nMystery/puzzle cache (also called \"Unknown cache\"): The coordinates of the final cache are usually hidden in some cipher, image or text and the geocacher has to discover it.\nLetterbox hybrid cache: A combination of geocaching and letterboxing in the same container. Instead of a classic cache there is a stamp, which the finder can print to his or her diary.\nWebcam cache: It is not a typical cache where the geocacher has to find a hidden box with a logbook. Instead, he has to find a webcam on the published coordinates and take a photo of himself.\nVirtual cache: Similar to webcam cache, there is no hidden box at the coordinates. The geocacher only has to find out information such as the name on a monument and send it to the owner of the cache.\nEarth cache: Very similar to virtual cache, but in a geographically interesting place. The geocacher has to find out answers for the questions in a listing, take a photo here, and send it to the owner of the cache.\nEvent cache: Meeting organized and attended by geocachers. There is also special type of event \u2013 CITO (Cache in, trash out), where geocachers have to clean up an area. An event attended by more than 500 people is called a Mega-event, and an event attended by more than 5000 people is called a Giga-event"}

He was a military leader in medieval Spain. After his death, he became the hero in a mediaeval Spanish poem, \"El Cantar de mio Cid\".\nExiled from the court, El Cid went on to command a Moorish force. After the Christian defeat, El Cid was recalled to service. He took command of a combined Christian and Moorish army. He used this army to create his own fiefdom in Valencia. He was a brave general that lead his country to victory. El Cid was born in Vivar, also known as Castillona de Bivar. The Muslims gave him the nickname \"El Cid\" from the Spanish Arabic word al-sid, meaning \"lord.\" \nEl Cid was brought up at the court of King Ferdinand the Great and served Ferdinand's son, Sancho II of Le\u00f3n and Castile. He rose to become the commander and royal standard-bearer of Castile when Sancho became king in 1065. \nSancho wanted to reunite all the three parts of his dead father's kingdom. Rodrigo lead the Castilian military campaigns against Sancho's brothers, Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Garc\u00eda II of Galicia, as well as in the Muslim kingdoms in Al-Andalus. Sancho was murdered in 1072. \nWorking for Alfonso.\nAfter his brother's death, Alfonso returned from exile attempting to claim his dead brothers throne. El Cid then swore Alfonso to the throne and named him King.\nAlthough, Alfonso feared that El Cid would not prove loyal, but with no proof. In 1074, El Cid married Alfonso's niece, Jimena. Some believe the marriage was encouraged by Alfonso to bring El Cid under his watchful eye. Alfonso never gave El Cid a chance to make a better name for himself in the military, and kept him from becoming famous. \nEl Cid soon became fed up, and in 1081, without Alfonso's permission, he invaded the city of Toledo.\nThis made Alfonso very mad, and his advisors told him that El Cid had tried to betray him by attacking the city without his permission, false information. Alfonso then banished him from the Kingdom of Castile. \nLater life.\nEl Cid then worked as a paid, professional soldier for the Muslim king of Saragossa. During the time that had past, El Cid defeated Christian attacks and continued to make himself better known and more famous as a general. This caused other kings and generals to fear that El Cid would overtake them with his power.\nIn October 1086, Alfonso had a battle with the Almoravids. They attacked each other at Sagrajas, where Alfonso was defeated. The loss made Alfonso reconsider banishing El Cid. Alfonso called him back, hoping El Cid could defeat the Almoravids. However, the trust issues led the two men to go their separate ways yet again. The Alfonso and El Cid were meet together with their armies, but they failed to because of miscommunication. People convinced King Alfonso that El Cid had planned to not show up, and let Alfonso and his army be defeated. Once again, Alfonso exiled El Cid.\nEl Cid and his small army left, and invaded land in eastern Spain. Four years later, he ruled a large, wealthy territory. Its capital was Valencia.\nHe ruled well, allowing Muslims and Christians to mingle. King Alfonso begged for El Cid\u2019s help in his ongoing battle with the Almoravids. Meanwhile, the kingdom El Cid had worked so hard to build was falling apart from Muslim revolts. El Cid went back to Valencia and returned the city to peace.\nEl Cid continued to conquer many cities before his death on July 10, 1099 in Valencia. El Cid's life story inspired many playwrights and poems."}

As something starts to look more human-like, there is a point at which people start to feel it looks wrong. At this point, they have negative feelings toward the object. These feelings keep getting worse as the object is made to look more human-like. At a certain point, as the object starts to get very close to looking human-like, how people feel towards it tend to reverse and they have more positive emotional feelings towards it. The theory was created by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori in 1970.\nOne of the main points of the theory to explain this is that people are not as affected in an emotional way by the object if it is easy to tell it is not human. After a certain point, people start to feel emotionally about it, but feel negatively because it is so nonhuman. As it gets closer to looking human, they start to feel more positive emotions towards it. A graph of these feeling shows a valley. This is part of the reason for the naming of the theory."}

Black started in the physiology department at the University of Glasgow. While there, he became interested in how adrenaline affected the human heart. He went to work for ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. While working for ICI, he created propranolol. Propranolol is a beta blocker, used to treat heart disease. Black also created cimetidine. It is a drug used to treat stomach ulcers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for creating these drugs.\nEarly life and education.\nBlack was born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire. He was the fourth of five sons of a Baptist family. His father was a mining engineer. He grew up in Fife. Black went to Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. At the age of 15, he won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews. At St Andrews, he studied medicine. He graduated in 1946.\nAfter graduating he joined the Physiology department at University College as an Assistant Lecturer. He later took a lecturer position at the University of Malaya. Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he perceived as the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.\nCareer.\nAfter graduation, Black took a teaching job in Singapore for three years. He moved to London in 1950. Later in 1950, he returned to Scotland. He joined the University of Glasgow (Veterinarian School). There that he became interesteed in how adrenaline affects the human heart. He was mainly interesting in how it affected people with angina. He found the effects of adrenaline did not help. He joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. He worked with the company until 1964. During this time, he created propranolol, which became the world's best-selling drug. While at ICI, Black developed a new way of doing research. Before this, drug molecules would be created and then tested to find in what ways the molecules could be used as medicine. Black chose to pick a medical use and then try to create the molecules for that medicine. The discovery of propranolol was said to be the greatest discovery in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis.\nAt the same time, Black was trying to find a treatment for stomach ulcers. ICI did not wish to do this so Black stopped working for them in 1964. He joined Smith, Kline and French. He worked for them for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine. It was first sold under the brand name Tagamet in 1975. Tagamet soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.\nBlack became the department head of pharmacology at University College London in 1973. He created a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry. He had many problems trying to get money for research, so he quit. He went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978. He worked there until 1984. Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of King's College London medical school. He stayed there until 1992. He created the James Black Foundation in 1988 with money from Johnson and Johnson. He worked with 25 scientists in drugs research. This research included gastrin inhibitors which may stop some stomach cancers.\nBlack helped increase basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology. His creation of propranolol is thought to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century. Propranolol has helped millions of people.\nHonours and awards.\nBlack was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research. He received the honour from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the Order of Merit by the Queen.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. That same year he was awarded the Lasker award. In 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development. In 1994 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine."}

They use diesel fuel.\nLayout.\nA semi-tractor has no body and does not carry any cargo on it. The front of a semi-trailer is put on it. Only the rear of the trailers have wheels, so the tractor pulls the trailer and carries the front part of the trailer's weight.\nThe tractor and driver cost as much as a truck, but the trailers don't cost very much. You can have more trailers than tractors and the tractors can change trailers easily. The tractor and driver do not have to wait to be loaded or unloaded, they can change trailers. They can also pull different kinds of trailers, any type that is needed at the time.\nCountry differences.\nAll countries have different laws for semi-trucks. The biggest difference between the EU, UK, and US is the length of the semi-truck. Most weigh about the same (US trucks weigh a little less than EU and UK trucks). Most are about the same width and height. In large countries truck s can be longer. They can have a larger cargo space. Longer semi-tractors drive better at faster speeds. Most US trucks are \"convential\" (bonneted in UK) with the engine under a hood in front of the cab. In the US shorter trucks weigh less. The weight has to be spread out over a long length. This is important on bridges. With long semi-trucks not as many trucks fit on the bridge and the weight of the axles are far apart. This length is important in the US.\nIn the UK and EU roads are smaller and turn more. Trucks have to be shorter. Most are cab-over-engine models (COE). The driver sits over the engine and the front of the cab is flat. Shorter trucks can weigh more. Trailers can have three axles under the load, and short semi-tractors with two axles. These have the same weight and number of axles as a long semi-truck. They take up less space and can turn better.\nDifferent countries drive on different sides of the road. This is named for the side the driver sits on. The UK is the main right-hand drive (RHD) country. Most countries that were British colonies are RHD. The EU and most other countries are LHD. The US was British but is LHD. Canada (next to the US) is LHD. When you are building a truck LHD or RHD is not important. Australia builds US type Mack and International trucks with RHD.\nTrailer types.\nSemi-trailers can be the same types as trucks. Because they don't cost as much as a truck they can also be special types. Shipping containers are large and heavy. In some countries special laws cover them. Skeleton frame trailers are built to carry them. Long semi-trailers are used for logs. In the UK and EU some logs are smaller. The trailers are 2 or 3 logs long. They have a crane to load them. In the US \"lowboys\" (the load is just above the road) carry large construction machines. Special trailers can be built for very big loads. Australia \"road-trains\" can pull 4 trailers."}

Analog video cameras produce signals that can be displayed with analog televisions. The signals can be shown at the time, or can be stored in an analog format on magnetic tape. Digital video cameras produce digital images.\nVideo cameras were invented early in the 20th century for television use, and by the end of the century, people could buy digital video cameras, which can almost immediately display the image. Video recorders that could record the image on magnetic tape were created in the middle 20th century.\nAt first, video cameras were large and expensive. Only professionals operated them. As the electronics industry advanced, and solid state circuits with transistors and microprocessors replaced vacuum tubes, video cameras became smaller and inexpensive. Now many mobile phones and other consumer electronic devices include video cameras. In addition, software is now widely available to edit or to compress the output from video cameras.\nUses.\nModern video cameras have numerous designs and uses, not all of which resemble the early television cameras. \nSpecial uses of video cameras include systems that capture images at the finish line to time races and sporting events. Some toll roads use video cameras to make pictures of the license plate of any car that fails to pay tolls.

Usually the person who shows this type of aggression feels provoked to do so. Instrumental relational aggression (predatory, goal-oriented) is used in order for an individual to get what they want.\nPredatory or defensive behavior between members of different species is not normally considered as \"aggression.\"\nLike most, or even all behaviors, aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help an animal reproduce and survive. Animals may use aggression to gain and secure territories, as well as other resources including food, water, and mating opportunities.\nThe most apparent type of aggression is that seen in the interaction between a predator and its prey. An animal defending itself against a predator becomes aggressive in order to survive and predator in order to secure food. Because aggression against a much larger enemy or group of enemies would be nearly certain to lead to the death of an animal, animals have developed a good sense of when they are outnumbered. This ability to gauge the strength of other animals gives animals a \"fight or flight\" response to predators; depending on how strong they gauge the predator to be, animals will either become aggressive or flee.\nAlthough humans share aspects of aggression with non-human animals, they differ from most of them in the complexity of their aggression because of factors such as culture, morals, and social situations.\nAggression research.\nAggression is a behavior where one harms another individual intentionally. Over the years, there has been an ongoing debate on the origin or causes of aggression among humans. Some theories argue that aggression is innate, while others contend it is a learned behavior."}

This lead him to believe that steroids lessened the pain caused by the disease. During this time, biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall has found several steroids created by the adrenal gland cortex. After several years of work, Hench and Kendall decided to use one of these steroids on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Testing of the hypothesis was delayed because the synthesis of Compound E was costly and time-consuming, and Hench served in the military during World War II. The tests were conducted successfully in 1948 and 1949. The steroid they used was named Compound E at the time. It later become known as cortisone.\nHench, Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein won the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects.\" As of the 2010 prizes, Hench and Kendall are the only two Nobel winners who worked with Mayo Clinic. \nDuring his career, Hench was one of the founding members of the American Rheumatism Association.

In 2010 the population was only 14, making it the second-smallest incorporated community in Illinois. It was a major French colonial town of the Illinois Country. Its peak population was about 7,000 when it was a regional center. Kaskaskia became the capital of the Illinois Territory on February 3, 1809. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state and Kaskaskia was its capital until 1819. \nIn April 1881, the Mississippi River moved its path to the east. This flooded most of the town. The river now passes east rather than west of the town. The state boundary line, however, remained in its original location. Kaskaskia is on a small part of Illinois west of the river. It can only be reached from Missouri.\nHistory.\nThe town was named after the Native American word for the Kaskaskia River. The site of Kaskaskia had been a Native American village for thousands of years. In 1703 French Jesuit missionaries started a mission. They wanted to change the Illini (Native American) people's religion to Catholicism. The first stone church was built in 1714. The French also had a fur trading post at the village. French settlers came to farm and mine lead on the Missouri side of the river. In 1718 Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana and a fort, Fort de Chartres,was built.\nFrom its beginning, Kaskaskia was a French/Indian settlement, with a few French men and many Illinois and other Native Americans. In 1707, the population was about 2,200. Most were Illinois, who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans. From the French, the Native Americans, and their mixed-race descendants at Kaskaskia came the voyageurs and coureurs des bois. They explored and hunted in the Missouri River country. The French wanted to trade with all the Prairie tribes, and with the Spanish colony in New Mexico. This idea horrified the Spanish. The explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne set up trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719.\nKing Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church. During French rule, Kaskaskia and the other farming settlements in the Illinois Country were important for supplying Lower Louisiana, especially New Orleans, with wheat and corn. Farmers sent tons of flour south over the years. These staple crops could not grow in Louisiana's climate.\nIn 1733, the French built Fort Kaskaskia. The British destroyed the fort in 1763 during the French and Indian War. After the war France gave up the territory east of the river. Many French-speaking people from Kaskaskia and other colonial towns moved west of the Mississippi to the Spanish-held, Upper Louisiana settlements of Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and other areas.\nOn July 4 1778, during the American Revolution, the city was captured by George Rogers Clark and his force of 200 men including Captain Leonard Helm. It was one of the western-most battles of the Revolution. The parish rang the church bell in celebration, which has since been called the \"liberty bell\". The bell is housed in a brick building near the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The brick church was built in 1843 in the squared-off French style.\nAs a center of the regional economy, Kaskaskia was the capital of Illinois Territory from 1809 until Illinois became a state in 1818. Zaskaskia continued as the state capital until 1819. Its peak population was about 7,000 before the capital moved in 1819 to Vandalia. Although introduction of steamboats on the Mississippi River helped the economies of river towns in the 19th century, their use also had devastating environmental effects. Loss of trees (Deforestation) along the river banks was caused by steamboat crews' cutting trees to feed the engine fires. River banks became unstable and collapsed into the water.\nAt first, the town had a good site where the Kaskaskia and Mississippi Rivers joined. But from St. Louis to the junction of the Ohio River, the Mississippi became wider and more shallow, with more severe flooding. Much of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns have been lost through flooding and erosion. Following the Great Flood of 1844, Kaskaskia was rebuilt to the south. The original site became an island, surrounded by the Mississippi River. The flood of 1881 destroyed the original town, and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River, passing east instead of west of the town. Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area.\nAs the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which is in the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old river bed, is regularly flooded. It has a bridge to carry traffic over it. In 1893, the people of the town moved and rebuilt the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Kaskaskia Island.\nBy 1950 only 112 people lived in Kaskaskia. By 1970 the population had fallen to 79, and it continued to fall to 33 in 1980. The town was flooded with nine feet of water by the Great Flood of 1993, which reached the roofs of the buildings. By 2000, with a only nine residents, Kaskaskia was almost a ghost town and the least populous incorporated community in the State of Illinois.\nGeography.\nKaskaskia is located at .\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total land area of 0.2809\u00a0km\u00b2 (0.1085 sq\u00a0mi, or 69.41 acres), all land. However, the village is only a small part of Kaskaskia Precinct, which includes all of Randolph County's land west of the Mississippi. Kaskaskia Precinct has a land area of 24.037 square miles (62.255\u00a0km\u00b2) and a 2000 census population of 36 persons. In 1993 the Mississippi River almost completely flooded the island."}

Psychopaths are unemotional. They do not care about the emotions or rights of others. They show almost no empathy, and do not try to conform to social norms. They lack a conscience and do not feel guilt. A similar term is sociopathy.\nMany psychopaths are charming and often manage to have superficial ties with other people. They use other people for their own benefit. Psychopaths often show other antisocial behaviour as well, including sadism, violence and deception. They are very selfish and discard people whom they have no further use for. They tend to have many children by many partners.\nThe definition of psychopathy has varied. Different definitions are used. They only partly overlap and sometimes seem contradictory.\nThere are efforts to use behaviour therapy to treat psychopaths; very often, this is done in prisons.\nSome people are mislabeled as \"psychopaths\", but have no problems with social norms, but they are good at influencing people."}

Such projections are necessary to create maps. The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way; this is called distortion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions may be less bad. This is why cartographers use different mathematical projections for different maps.\nCarl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane, without distorting it. This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today.\nTo understand the projections, it is easier to imagine a light source, a globe, and another geometric object. The light source shines \"a shadow\" of each point of the globe onto the geometric object. At the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled, this yields the map. It is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used."}

These usually start closer towards the end of the pregnancy. It often proceeds for various amounts of time after childbirth. Restrictions: certain food taboos, staying only in the village or at home, avoiding certain places, no consumption of alcohol, cigarettes or stimulants or handling with sharp instruments.

These days, it still exists in various cultures around the world among indigenous people in India, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Africa, North America and South America.\nReasons.\nThese range from the spiritual and physical protection of the child, bonding of father with child as well as wife, the public recognition of fatherhood and support and relief of mother so she can maintain the household after the childbirth.

It was founded in 1808. Corydon was the second capital of the Indiana Territory, from May 1, 1813, until December 11, 1816. When Indiana became a US state in 1816, Corydon became Indiana's first state capital. On January 10, 1825 the capital moved to Indianapolis. The town remains the county seat of Harrison County. It had a population of 3,122 at the 2010 census.\nHistory.\nCorydon was part of the land captured for the United States by George Rogers Clark from the British during the American Revolution.\nIn the early 1800s, Edward Smith and his family settled on the site of today's county fairgrounds. William Henry Harrison, Governor of the Indiana Territory, often stopped to rest at their home while travelling to and from Vincennes. Harrison decided to build a town there and asked Edward Smith's daughter, Jenny, to name it. She chose the name \"Corydon\" from Harrison's favorite hymn, the Pastoral Elegy.\nEarly history.\nHarrison sold the town site to Harvey Heth in 1808, a government surveyor and large landowner. Heth donated the town square for public use, and sold individual lots to settlers and the government. In 1809, Corydon was joined by road to Doup's Ferry, 15 miles (24\u00a0km) to the south in Mauck's Port. This gave access to the Ohio River for trade. Corydon sent a mounted militia company company nicknamed the Yellow Jackets to support the US army in the War of 1812. They fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe.\nCorydon, Madison and Jeffersonville all wanted to be the new capital of the territory, but Corydon was more central to the population of the newly reorganized Indiana Territory. Corydon became the second capital of the Indiana Territory on May 1, 1813, when it was moved there from Vincennes. When Indiana became the 19th US state on 11 December 1816, Corydon became the state capital of Indiana. The first state capitol building made using limestone from a nearby quarry, was built from 1814-1816. The Governor's Mansion and First State Office Building were built in 1817. The Grand Masonic Lodge, the first in the state, was built in 1819.\nThe state's first constitution was written in Corydon during June 1816. The 43 delegates, representing Indiana Territory's counties, met in the Harrison County Courthouse. Because of cramped conditions inside the courthouse and the summer heat, they often met outside under a giant elm tree next to Big Indian Creek. This tree is now known as the Constitution Elm, and its trunk is still preserved.\nDennis Pennington, the speaker of territorial legislature and others from Harrison County in the Indiana General Assembly did not want to move the capital from Corydon. They added a clause to the state constitution during the convention preventing the capital from leaving the town before 1825. But as the population of the state shifted continually northward, it was no longer convenient to have a state capital at the southern edge of the state. The capital was finally moved to Indianapolis on January 10, 1825.\nPost-capital period.\nCorydon was the site of the only Civil War battle fought in Indiana. On July 9, 1863, Confederate cavalry led by Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan, and citizens of Brandenburg, Kentucky, crossed the Ohio River into Indiana. This became known as \"Morgan's Raid\". Morgan's 2,500 men were opposed by 400 hastily assembled home guard at the Battle of Corydon. The Union troops were quickly defeated and the town surrendered. Corydon was sacked in retaliation for Union looting in Kentucky. The town's treasury of $690 was seized, and prisoners in the jail were released. Morgan demanded from $600 to $700 from each mill and shop owner; otherwise their buildings would be burned. Tradition says one Corydon miller overpaid by $200; Morgan promptly returned it to him.\nThe railroad reached Corydon in 1882. Corydon was connected by Southern Railways to the main line running across northern Harrison County at Crandall. The line remained open to passenger traffic until 1996. In 2008, the line was owned by Lucas Oil.\nIn 1929, the county built a new courthouse to replace the old state capitol building. The old statehouse was converted into an historical memorial.\nThe Old Capitol Building is now a state historic site and the downtown area became a National Historic District in 1973. The Governor's Headquarters, Constitution Elm, First State Office Building and Posey House are also part of the historic area. The O'Bannon Publishing Company prints the \"Corydon Democrat\"', a weekly newspaper. Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon owned the publishing company and his wife still lives nearby.\nGeography.\nCorydon is located at (38.212724, -86.125318).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1\u00a0km\u00b2), all land."}

The Tayasu was one of the \"gosanky\u014d\". The Tayasu were the oldest members of the Shogun's family who still had the name Tokugawa. The other members of the family had the Matsudaira surname.\nHis father was Tayasu Munetake and he was the grandson of the eighth shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune. The Tayasu house held different beliefs than the others living in Edo Castle. They lived a lifestyle that was more strict. The Tayasu following the example set by Yoshimune. In Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit (\"masuraoburi\") as opposed to feminine spirit (\"taoyameburi\"). This set them apart from the rest of the family. Munetake thought he would rule after his father died. This did not happen. Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige became ruler. Because of this, Sadanobu was raised under the belief that he would be the next heir to the title of Shogun. His education growing up was very good. He was taught along Confucian lines. By the time Sadanobu was in his teens, he had already learned much of the teachings of Confucius. As he grew older, many expected more strongly for Sadanobu do well because many members of the Tayasu house began to die young. The family tried many ways to make Sadanobu as the next shogun. Their attempts were stopped by the political clique of Tanuma Okitsugu. Okitsugu was the chief r\u014dj\u016b at that time.\nCareer.\nAfter the last failed try to get Sadanobu adopted by the shogun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni. Sadakuni was head of one of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira houses. This was another part of the Tokugawa branch of the family. They ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern (Mutsu Province.\nSandanobu took control of Shirakawa in 1783. As soon as he took control he had to deal with a very bad problem. The lands he controlled were said to be worth 110,000 \"koku\". 1 Koku was the amount of rice needed to feed one person for one year. The land should have been able to create enough rice to feed 110,000 people for a year. But 108,600 Koku was said to be \"lost\". Sadanobu worked constantly to fix the economic problem in Shirakawa. He work fixed the problems of the finances and economy of the lands. The changes he made, along with his political workings made him very famous. Because of this, he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787. He was also made regent to the 11th shogun Tokugawa Ienari early the next year.\nLiterary Skill.\nSadanobu was also known as a writer. He wrote using the pen name \"Raku\u014d\" (\u697d\u7fc1).

Another term, which really means the same thing, is postmodern art. Yet another term, which goes wider than art, is Postmodernism.\nThis problem of labelling comes about because the word 'modern' in art was used for some art from the mid-Victorian period through the whole 20th century. It covers a wide range of styles and movements. So when art critics wanted to describe post-WWII art they had to use a different word. Thus, in art, 'contemporary' (which really means 'at the same time as') comes to mean 'modern', and modern comes to mean 'earlier'."}

In 2010 there were 65,794 people living in the city. St. Charles is the second largest city, and the county seat of St. Charles County. It is northwest of St. Louis, Missouri on the Missouri River. It is the third oldest city west of the Mississippi. It began in 1765 as \"Les Petites C\u00f4tes\", \"The Little Hills\", named by Louis Blanchette, a French Canadian fur trader. The town was the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804. The city served as the first Missouri capital from 1821 to 1826. The Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne shrine is in Saint Charles. It is also the home of the St. Louis National Weather Service Forecast Office, serving central, east-central and northeastern Missouri, as well as west-central and southwest Illinois.\nHistory.\nLouis Blanchette.\nLouis Blanchette was a French Canadian who went to the Americas for adventure. Blanchette settled in Saint Charles in 1769 under the authority of the Spanish governor of Upper Louisiana. He was the civil and military leader until his death in 1793. About 25 buildings were built. Although the settlement was under Spanish control, most settlers were French Canadians.\nFort San Carlos.\nThe first church, built in 1791, was dedicated to San Carlos Borromeo, and the town became known as \"San Carlos del Misuri\": \"St. Charles of the Missouri\". This church was destroyed by a tornado in 1916. The Spanish Lieutenant-Governor Carlos de Hault de Lassus appointed Daniel Boone commandant of the Femme Osage District, which he served until the United States government bought the area in the Louisiana Purchase in 1804. The name of the town, San Carlos, was anglicized (turned into English) to become St. Charles. \nState capital and growth.\nMissouri became a US state in 1821. The government decided to build a new state capital, the \"City of Jefferson\", in the center of the state on the Missouri River. A temporary capital was needed, and St. Charles beat eight other cities in a competition to be the temporary capitol. It offered free meeting space for the legislature in rooms above a hardware store. This building is preserved as the First Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site. It is open to tourists. The Missouri government met there until Jefferson City was ready in 1826. \nSt. Charles, Missouri is where the first claimed interstate project started in 1956. A highway sign making this claim is placed off of Interstate 70 going westbound to the right of the first capital exit.\nEducation.\nThe City of St. Charles school district has five elementary schools, two middle schools, two high schools, and the Lewis &amp; Clark Tech Building.\nLindenwood Universitywas started in 1827 by Major George Sibley and his wife Mary as a women's school named Lindenwood School For Girls.

The Xia was probably created by emperor Yu the Great. It is not known for certain if the Xia dynasty actually existed. Many people think that the Xia dynasty is only a legend. This is because there is no evidence that can prove that there was some dynasty before 1600 BC. There were found some archaeological excavations from 1500 BC which may come from the Xia dynasty. For example one of the excavations causes archaeologists to believe that the foundations of China were created during the Xia dynasty. Also there are findings of the oldest Chinese calendar called a lunar calendar. Xia dynasty was ended by a dynasty named Shang.\nShang dynasty.\nThe Shang dynasty lasted from 1600 BC until 1046 BC. It started when Tang took control from the last Xia emperor, Jie. The dynasty ended with the suicide of Di Xin.\nThe Shang dynasty was important for Chinese culture. The first Chinese character fonts were created at this time. They were mainly used by seers and shaman. People made their own ritual vessels, agricultural and craft tools and even weapons. Everything was made of cast bronze.\nIn agriculture, millets, wheats and rice were the main crops. Mulberries were also grown. They were used to feed mulberry silkworms.\nZhou dynasty.\nThe Zhou dynasty lasted from 1045 BC until 256 BC. The Shangs had became weak because they were always fighting with a neighboring tribes. This was good for the less advanced Zhou. They defeat the Shang in the current town of An-yang. After that, the Zhou dynasty took the government.

It is a simple device and is easy to configure. A hub acts like a repeater: all data that arrives to one port is sent to all other ports (without looking at IP address for the data's destination). That means that all devices in this network will get all data. A hub is a very simple device and does not operate Ethernet traffic. In contrast, a switch hub has a lower latency. Many hubs have LED signal lamps to show the state of the hub (which ports are connected and if the hub is working). A \"collision\" happens when two or more devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time. When collisions happen all of the devices have to go through a routine to resolve the conflict. The process is set in the Ethernet Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol.\nSome hubs may also come with a BNC and/or Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.\nThere are three kinds of hubs:\nUses.\nHubs can be used for:\nHistorically, the main reason for purchasing hubs rather than switches was their price.

It is the county seat of Lancaster County. It is one of the older inland cities in the United States. It has a population of 59,322. It ranks eighth in population among Pennsylvania's cities. The Lancaster metropolitan area population is 507,766. So, it is 101st among US metropolitan areas.\nLancaster was home to James Buchanan, the nation's 15th president, and to congressman and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens.\nThe city's primary industries include healthcare, tourism, manufacturing, and professional services. It also has the Park City Center shopping mall. A controversial, citywide video surveillance system includes the most outdoor cameras per capita of any US city.\nHistory.\nIt was first called Cuteanal Town. Its first leader, John Wright, renamed the city after his home English city of Lancaster. The city's symbol, the red rose, is from the House of Lancaster. Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn's Woods Charter of William Penn, and was laid out by James Hamilton in 1734. It was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818. When the British captured Philadelphia in the American Revolution, Lancaster became the capital of the colonies on September 27, 1777. After the Continental Congress met one day, they moved still farther away, to York, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania government also moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster, but stayed in Lancaster until the British troops left Philadelphia. Lancaster was capital of Pennsylvania again from 1799 to 1812, after which the capital was moved to Harrisburg.\nIn 1737, the Lancaster County Prison was built in the city, styled after Lancaster Castle in England. The prison remains in use. Public hangings were conducted there until 1912.\nThe first paved road in the United States was the former Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike (which makes up part of the present-day U.S. Route 30). The Turnpike opened in 1795. The Turnpike connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia, and was designed by a Scottish engineer named John Loudon MacAdam. Lancaster residents are known to use the word, \"macadam\", instead of \"pavement\" or \"asphalt\". This name is a reference to the paving process used by MacAdam.\nThe city of Lancaster was home to several important figures in American history. Wheatland, the estate of James Buchanan, the fifteenth President of the United States, is one of Lancaster's most popular attractions. Thaddeus Stevens, considered among the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives, lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a Radical Republican and for his abolitionism. The Fulton Opera House in the city was named for Lancaster native Robert Fulton, who had designed the modern steamboat. \nAfter the American Revolution, the city of Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster: the Conestoga wagon and the Pennsylvania long rifle. The Conestoga wagon was named after the Conestoga River, which runs through the city. \nIn 1803, Meriwether Lewis visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known surveyor Andrew Ellicott. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude and longitude as part of his overall training needed to lead the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\nIn 1879, Franklin Winfield Woolworth opened his first successful \"five and dime\" store in the city of Lancaster. The F. W. Woolworth Company is succeeded by Foot Locker.\nLancaster was one of the winning communities for the All-America City award in 2000.\nGeography.\nLancaster is located at 40\u00b002'23\" North, 76\u00b018'16\" West (40.039860, -76.304366), and is above sea level.\nThe city is located about southeast of Harrisburg, west of Philadelphia, north-northeast of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and 0.14% is water.\nTop employers.\nAccording to Lancaster's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nGreen Roofs.\nLancaster has one of the highest rates of green roof space per capita in the US.Lancaster now has of green roofs for a city with a downtown population of 65,000.\nSecurity Camera Controversy.\nCommunity discussion of rising crime rates sought to avoid a government- or police-operated system of cameras. The Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 2004 to carry out the implementation and operation of a video surveillance system. Paid LCSC staff are background checked by the FBI and trained to monitor the network of 164 closed-circuit TV cameras in the city of Lancaster.\nIn 2009, the LCSC's expansion from a 70 to a 165 camera network attracted national attention. The national attention led to people asking to end the system. MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann used the story in his 'Worst Person in the World' segment, \"calling out the 'citizen patriots of Lancaster, Pennsylvania' and criticizing them for spying on each other\". The surveillance system was also featured on ABC's \"Nightline\" and \"CBS Evening News\".\nAlthough public opinion was initially mixed among Lancaster residents, statistical and anecdotal data suggest that the network of cameras is achieving the desired effect. In the fall of 2010, the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition was among several factors credited for a 13.7% drop in Lancaster's violent crime rate according to the FBI's Unified Crime Report (UCR). Property crime dropped 7.1% during the same period. Neighboring cities have not experienced similar reductions in crime. Although in the year 2010, cameras only helped solve 28 of the 6,653 crimes committed in the city in the year 2010. Although the year of 2009 received a reduction in violent crimes of over 13% and recorded 465 violent offenses, the following year of 2010 saw a rise in violent offenses. Violent offenses jumped from 465 in 2009 to 511 in 2010. Lancaster Community Safety Coalition had a success rate of preventing and helping police catch a suspect in .037% of crimes committed and Lancaster has more unsolved homicides since the installation of the cameras.\nTransportation.\nThe Red Rose Transit Authority (RRTA) provides local bus transit to Lancaster City as well as surrounding areas in Lancaster County. RRTA is headquartered outside the City of Lancaster.\nBieber Trailways (formerly Capitol Trailways) provides intercity bus transit from the Lancaster Train and Bus Station to King of Prussia, Philadelphia, and New York City to the east, and York and Harrisburg to the west.\nAmtrak also serves the Lancaster Train and Bus Station, located on the northernmost edge of the city at 53 East McGovern Avenue. The \"Pennsylvanian\", with service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as well as the \"Keystone Service\", which runs from Harrisburg to New York via Philadelphia, both serve Lancaster.\nThe city is served by the Lancaster Airport, located six miles (10\u00a0km) north of downtown and just south of Lititz.\nLancaster is also a hub for automobile traffic, with so many major roadways passing through or around the city, including US-30, US-222, PA-283, PA-72, and PA-272.\nArt and museums.\nThe city of Lancaster hosts several museums that preserve its important contributions to society. The Demuth Museum is in the former home of a well-known Lancaster painter named Charles Demuth. Additional art museums include the Lancaster Museum of Art and the Philips Museum of Art on the campus of Franklin &amp; Marshall College. Art students at the state-of-the-art Pennsylvania College of Art and Design present their works at the academy's gallery that is open to the public. Another newly constructed museum, completed in 2007, is the Lancaster County Quilts and Textile Museum that celebrates the hand-sewn quilts and other textile items produced by the region's Amish and Mennonite communities. Lancaster also possesses two other museums showing Pennsylvania Dutch heritage with the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society Museum and the Heritage Center Museum. Children can have a hands-on experience with educational learning at the Hands-on House, also known as Children's Museum of Lancaster. Nature and geology-minded visitors can view the more earthly exhibits of the Louise Arnold Tanger Arboretum and the North Museum of Natural History and Science. Upon completion, the Lancaster County Convention Center will incorporate the Stevens and Smith Historic Site, a museum that will include the preserved home of Thaddeus Stevens and his confidante Lydia Hamilton Smith.\nEducation.\nEducation in Lancaster is provided by many private and public institutions. The School District of Lancaster runs the city's public schools. The local high school campuses are McCaskey and McCaskey East. Established in 1836, it is the second oldest school district in Pennsylvania. Lancaster Catholic High School was founded in 1926. It currently falls under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Harrisburg. With a P-12 enrollment of more than 500 students, Lancaster Country Day School is one of the region's largest independent nonsectarian schools. Founded in 1908 as the Shippen School for Girls, the school later became coeducational.\nLancaster area hosts several colleges and universities including: Consolidated School of Business, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Lancaster General College of Nursing &amp; Health Sciences, Lancaster Theological Seminary, Lancaster Bible College, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Central Pennsylvania College,and the Harrisburg Area Community College.\nOther websites.\n from Wikivoyage"}

It lets bicycle riders use a switch to shift gears, instead of a lever. Electronic gear shifting can be faster than shifting gears with a lever.\nHow it works.\nThe standard system for gearing up and down works with bowdens. A bowden is special kind of wound steel cable, which connects levers to the shifter, derailleur or brakes. As the rider pulls or taps a lever, the bowden reacts at the same time. That causes the bicycle to change gear.\nElectronic works without bowdens. The system is digital. There is no wound steel cable. Instead, there are multiple combinations of 0 and 1. A battery placed under the frame powers the system. Each battery should last for 1000\u00a0km depending on the manufacturer. Then it needs to be recharged. Wires for data and power are hidden inside the frame. Parts of the shifting systems are connected to each other. Servomotors do the shifting. The shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built into them. There is a self-adjustable microchip in the derailleur. The system has its own logic, which keeps the chain from dropping. There is no need for maintenance because the derailleur adjusts itself using the microchip.\nPros and cons.\nPros:\nCons:"}

It is part of an old area which includes Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Spitalfields and Petticoat Lane.\nToday, it is the heart of the city's British Bangladeshi community and is known to some as \"Banglatown\". It is famous for its many curry houses.\nHistory.\nBrick Lane gets its name from former brick and tile manufacture, using the local brick earth deposits, that began in the 15th century.\nSuccessive waves of immigration began with Huguenot refugees spreading from Spitalfields, where the master weavers were based, in the 17th century. This started a connection with clothing which lasted for over three centuries.\nThe Huguenots were followed by Irish, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the last century, Bangladeshis. The area became a centre for weaving, tailoring and the clothing industry, due to the abundance of semi- and unskilled immigrant labour.\nBrewing came to Brick Lane before 1680, with water drawn from deep wells. One brewer was Joseph Truman, first recorded in 1683. His family went on to establish the sizable Black Eagle Brewery on Brick Lane.\nThe Brick Lane Market was developed in the 17th century for fruit and vegetables. The Sunday market, like the ones on Petticoat Lane and nearby Columbia Road, dates from a dispensation given to the Jewish community. The Brick Lane Farmers' Market opened 6th June 2010.\nEmma Elizabeth Smith was viciously assaulted and robbed in Osborn Street, the part of Brick Lane that meets Whitechapel High Street, in the early hours of 3 April 1888. It was one of the first of the eleven Whitechapel Murders, some of which were done by the serial killer, Jack the Ripper.\nIn 1742, La Neuve Eglise, a Huguenot chapel, was built on the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street. By 1809, it had become The Jews\u2019 Chapel, for promoting Christianity to the expanding Jewish population, and became a Methodist Chapel in 1819 (John Wesley having preached his first covenant sermon at the nearby Black Eagle Street Chapel). In 1898, the building was consecrated as the Machzikei HaDath, or Spitalfields Great Synagogue. In 1976, it became the London Jamme Masjid (Great London), to serve the expanding British Bangladeshi community. The building is Grade II* listed. Many Bangladeshi immigrants to Brick Lane were from the Greater Sylhet region. These settlers helped shape Bangladeshi migration to Britain; families from Jagannathpur and Bishwanath tend to dominate in the Brick Lane area today."}

It was broadcast from September 26 to December 19, 2011 on Fox. Fox has said they will not pick the series up for a second year. The series is shopped to other networks. The series tells the story of the Shannon family as they travel 85 million year into the past. The series starred Jason O'Mara and Stephen Lang.\nSetting.\nIn the future, Earth is overcrowded. Most plants and animals are extinct. The skies are dark grey and the air is barely breathable because of pollution. The only hope for humanity to survive is in the distant past. Scientists find a way to travel to the past. They decide to send people into prehistoric times. They want to try to rebuild civilization and not repeat the mistakes they have made in their own world. The group in the past calls their new home \"Terra Nova\". The name means \"new land\" in Latin. People are sent back in time in groups called \"pilgrimages\". The story told in the series begins in the year 2149. It continues 85 million years in the past.\nPlot.\nThe series is about the Shannon family as they join the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova. Jim Shannon is the father of the family. He is a former police officer. Jim\u2019s wife, Elisabeth, is a surgeon. She is the newest member of Terra Nova\u2019s medical team and the new chief medical officer. Jim and Elizabeth have three children; Josh, Maddy and Zoe. Josh () is their 17 year old son. Josh did not want to travel back in time because doing this meant he would have to leave his girlfriend. Upon arriving at Terra Nova, he finds himself instantly drawn to the beautiful and rule-breaking Skye. Maddy is Josh\u2019s 15 years old sister. She hopes Terra Nova will give her a chance to reinvent herself. Zoe is the Shannon's 5 year old daughter.\nWhen the Shannon family first gets to Terra Nova, they meet Commander Nathaniel Taylor. He is the first person to go to Terra Nova and leader of the settlement. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it looks. Along with blue skies, large waterfalls and vegetation, the land is full of danger. This danger is not just from the man-eating dinosaurs. There is also a second group of people lead by Mira, who is opposed to Taylor and his leadership. This group, the Sixers, came to Terra Nova on the Sixth Pilgrimage. Many of the people on that pilgrimage had secret reasons for being there.\nReactions.\nThe series was given both good and bad reviews. Before it was being broadcast, most critics liked the series. Near the middle of the season, this opinion changed. Many critics did not like the way the characters acted with each other. By the end of the season, the opinion of the critics had changed again and had become more positive."}

An artificial fly is cast into the target area with a fly line and fly-fishing rod. This way, the fisherman or woman can catch a lot of fish, both freshwater and marine. Fly fishermen and women use special equipment, such as fly-fishing rod, fly-fishing reel, fly-fishing line, and pitfalls, which are made from natural or synthetic sling materials.\nHistory.\nFly fishing probably began in ancient Egypt, but its modern form goes all the way back to the England of the second half of the 19th century. The local fishermen caught fish with live and later artificial insects. This method began to spread to the rest of Europe. National and international competitions and championships were started. This has brought fly fishing to the attention of the public. \nTypes of fly fishing.\nLake fly fishing.\nLake fly fishing is done on backwaters and mostly on reservoirs, ponds and lakes. The actual hunt is done either from the bank or from the water, by fording or with the help of vessels like ships.\nRiver fly fishing.\nRiver fly fishing is usually done in flowing waters. It is normally done by fording. The fisherman or woman stands in the water dressed in special waders and wading boots. Fishing from the bank is also possible but it is not done very often. \nSea fly fishing.\nSea fly fishing is done by fording as well as fishing from a boat.\nDry fly fishing.\nDry fly fishing is done with a floating line. The bait floats on the water. The fly often looks like hatched insects or other food on the water surface.\nWet fly fishing.\nWet fly fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The fly is underwater and looks like drowned or newly hatched insects. \nStreamer fishing.\nStreamer fishing is mostly done with sinking fly lines. The flies look like insects or other organisms.\nNymph fishing.\nNymph fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The flies look like young insects.\nFly fishing equipment.\nFly-fishing rod is a kind of fishing rod which is designed only for fly fishing. Its purpose is to give enough power to the fly-fishing line, which carries an artificial fly to the hunting area. \nThe fly-fishing line moves an artificial fly to the place of casting. It is only supposed to be used for fly fishing and with the fly-fishing rod and fly-fishing reel. It is not suitable for other ways of fly fishing because it would be damaged.\nThe fly-fishing reel is used for storing and backing the fly-fishing line. The fly line is stored in a coil. This coil revolves around its vertical axis in the reel. The fly-fishing line is reeled by moving the coil. The coil is secured with a handle."}

Four main versions have been developed. These are called Merkava Mark I \u2013 Mark IV.\nWhen designing the Merkava tank, everything was subordinated to the survival aspect of the crew, the engine is placed in front of the tank and thus serves as an additional component of ballistic protection, while the crew can escape from the damaged Merkava door at the rear of the tank. The thick armor and high mobility make it one of the best protected tanks in the world. The design team that developed the first version of this tank, led by commander of the Israeli armored corps, Israel Tal.\nGeneral characteristics.\nMerkava Mark I.\nThe Mark I weighed 63 tons. It had 900 horsepowers and the maximum speed was 46\u00a0km/h. It was armed with a 105-millimeter M64 main gun, and the M68 was later installed. Coaxially with the main gun, a 7.62\u00a0mm machine gun was mounted; the turret featured two more 7.62\u00a0mm machine guns as well as a 60\u00a0mm mortar mounted externally.\nMerkava Mark II.\nThe Mark II was almost the same as the Mark I. The main differences were the internal mortar, better mobility and better resistance.\nMerkava Mark III.\nThe Mark III weighed 65 tons. It had 1200 horsepowers and the maximum speed was 60\u00a0km/h. It was armed with a 120-millimeter MG251 main gun. Other equipment was almost same as the Mark II. The Mark III was longer and had better armor than the Mark II, and some new systems such as fire-control system were added.\nMerkava Mark IV.\nThe Mark IV weighs 65 tons. It has 1500 horsepowers and the maximum speed is over 60\u00a0km/h. The Mark IV is armed with a 120-millimeter MG253 main gun using an electrical semi-automatic revolving magazine for 10 rounds. Coaxially with the main gun, a machine gun was mounted; on the turret, there is one more machine gun operated from inside the tank, in addition to an internally mounted 60-mm mortar. Mark IV has a new fire-control system that allows for shooting down helicopters; upgraded tracks; a digital battlefield management system; etc.\nMuseum exhibits.\nOne tank (Mark I) was donated to the Prague Military Technical Museum (Czech Republic), the only such exhibit in the world outside Israel."}

The silver mining started in the second half of 13th century. Unfortunately, the exact date and place, where it all started, remains unknown. Because of that there are lots of legends about the discovery of silver. The most common legend tells a story of a monk named Anthony from the monastery in Sedlec. According to this legend \nthe monk found out three silver rods at the foot of the hill.\nThe peak of mining in Kutn\u00e1 Hora was reached in 14th century.

Their depth varied from 20 to 150 metres. \nMiners worked with simple tools. Only 50 dm3 of rock were extracted within a six-hour shift. This technology allowed them to reach depths ranging from 400 to 450 metres in 14th century. The deepest mine in 16th century was the Osel (donkey) mine, which reached the depth of 600 metres.\nSt. George Mine.\nMine was discovered in 1967 during a hydro-geological exploration of the heart of the city. Originally it was thought that the legendary Osel mine had been discovered. But further exploration proved that it is St. George mine.\nThe mine was established around 1330\u2019s and remained operational until the end of 15th or beginning of 16th century.\nNowadays visitors may see 250 meters long tunnel, but in total there more than 800m of stopes, drifts or corridors. During those 250 meters it\u2019s possible to see several interesting areas. Such as drifts to other levels of mine, exploration drifts, partly flooded stope, fragments of wooden drainage or wooden props (protection against collapsing of ceiling)."}

The ADR was founded on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis, Georgia. Its borders were with Russia in the north, Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north-west, Democratic Republic of Armenia in the west, and Persian Empire (Iran) in the south. It had a population of 2.86 million. Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku, which is the de jure capital, was under Bolshevik control.\nUnder the ADR, the government was a parliamentary system in which a parliament, called the Milli Majlis (National Assembly of Azerbaijan) elected on the basis of universal, free, and proportional representation, was the highest political institution of state authority and the Council of Ministers was responsible before it. Fatali Khan Khoyski became its first prime minister. Besides the political party Musavat who had the majority in parliament, other political parties were Ehrar, Ittihad, Muslim Social-democrats as well as representatives of Armenian (21 out of 120 seats), Russian, Polish, Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament. Some members supported Pan-Islamist and Pan-Turkist ideologies.\nAmong the important accomplishments of the parliament was to give women the right to vote, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to give women equal political rights with men. Apart from this accomplishment, Azerbaijan made these reforms earlier than the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan.\nEnd of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, 1920.\nBy March 1920, it became clear that Soviet Russia would attack and invade Azerbaijan. The Soviet Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified by the fact that Soviet Russia could not survive without the Baku oil fields, which was at that time the largest oil field in the world with more than half of the world's oil reserves. According to the common opinion in Moscow, Russian Bolsheviks were to \"help\" the Baku proletariat (workers) in overthrowing the \"counter-revolutionary nationalists\", meaning the government and the state of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.\nAfter a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. On April 25, 1920, the Soviet Russian 11th Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan, entering Baku on April 27. They demanded the closing of the Azerbaijani parliament and set up their own Bolshevik government headed by Nariman Narimanov. To avoid bloodshed, the members of parliament had to agree with the demand and the ADR officially ended on April 28, 1920, giving way to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state. The Red Army met very little resistance in Baku from the Azerbaijani army, which was tied up on the Karabakh front. The first Communist government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left-wing political factions of the \"Hummat\" and \"Adalat\" political parties.\nIn May 1920, there was a major rebellion against the occupying Soviet Russian 11th Red Army in Ganja, who wanted to restore the Musavatists to power. The rebellion was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which was the last independent Caucasian country that was invaded in 1921 by Soviet Russia, then to Turkey and Iran, or were captured by Bolsheviks, like Mammed Amin Rasulzade, who was later allowed to emigrate (leave the country), or were executed (killed) like Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov, a total of over 20 generals, or assassinated by Armenian terrorists like Fatali Khan Khoyski and Behbudagha Javanshir. Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries, never to return again to their country. Other important ADR military leaders like the former Minister of Defense General Samedbey Mehmandarov and deputy defense minister General Ali-Agha Shikhlinski (who was called \"the God of Artillery\" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of Nariman Narimanov. Gen. Mehmandarov and Gen. Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school.\nIn the end, \"the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.\" However, the founding of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was made easier by the fact that there was a certain popular support for Bolshevik ideology in Azerbaijan, among the industrial workers in Baku."}

{"id": "316622", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316622", "title": "Thunderstorm", "text": "Thunderstorms are small, intense weather systems that make strong winds, heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. Thunderstorms can happen anywhere with two conditions: the air near the Earth's surface must be warm and moist (with lots of liquid), and the atmosphere must be unstable. 100 lightning bolts hit the earth every second, and at any one moment, about 1,800 thunderstorms happen around the earth.\nThunderstorms are rare in winter, mostly because of cold weather. When they happen, it is called thundersnow. Thundersnow is common in blizzards.\nCycle.\nUsually there are more clouds in the afternoon than in early morning. This is because the ground has warmed up enough by the afternoon for winds (\"updrafts\") to blow upward from the ground. When the air has gone high enough, the water vapor in it condenses into a cloud. The height where this happens depends on the temperature and humidity of the air. Sometimes the air can rise up as high as 5,000 to 10,000\u00a0feet (1,524 to 3,048\u00a0m) before a small cumulus cloud can condense from the invisible water vapor.\nHigh, puffy little clouds do not change until a lot of moisture is added. This moisture helps the updraft. Moisture can add heat, which means the cloud will warm up inside and go up even faster. The moisture makes the cumulus cloud \"mushroom\" upwards and turn into a tall cumulus cloud. The winds inside this cloud are very strong. Thunder and lightning begins when the top of the cloud is 25,000\u00a0feet (7,280\u00a0m) high. The inside of the cloud is, by this time, cold enough so that the water drops are turned into ice crystals. A cumulus cloud stops growing when it hits the warm stratosphere. Some thunderstorms grow twice as high as Mount Everest!\nStrong upper winds in the stratosphere smooth and spread the top of the cloud. This make the cloud look like the top of a mushroom or an anvil. The ice crystals in the anvil cloud give it a fuzzy look. As a thunderstorm grows, water drops or ice crystals inside the cloud hit and mix with each other, getting bigger. The bottom of the cloud grows dark with water about to fall. When the drops become so heavy that the winds inside the cloud cannot keep them up any more, they fall from the cloud as rain or hail. Even as they fall the water drops grow by mixing with the smaller drops, and makes big raindrops. Hail becomes bigger inside the cloud. One thunderstorm cloud usually runs out of energy in about 30 to 50\u00a0minutes. But supercell thunderstorms can last for hours until they dissipate by outflow.\nLightning.\nThunderstorms are very active with electricity and so are also called electrical storms.Lightning is a large electrical discharge that happens between two opposite charged surfaces.\nWhen lightning strikes, energy is let out. This energy moves to the air and makes air spread quickly and send out sound waves. Thunder is the sound that comes from the rapid spread of air along the lightning strike. Thunder is slower than lightning, because light is faster than sound.\nSevere thunderstorms.\nOnly about 10% of thunderstorms are thought severe. Severe thunderstorms cause high winds of more than , hail 1\u00a0inch in diameter (24\u00a0mm), flash floods, and tornadoes. Hailstorms damage crops, damage the metal on cars, and break windows. Sudden flash floods that happen because of heavy rains is the biggest reason for weather-related deaths.\nLightning, which happens with all thunderstorms, makes thousands of forest fires each year in the United States. Lightning also kills or injures hundreds of people a year in the United States.\nRegular thunderstorms begin when warm air near the ground mix with moist air, which makes an updraft (a wind that goes upward). A severe thunderstorm needs a strong \"up\"draft and a strong \"down\"draft. A strong updraft is made when, firstly, the ground is very hot; secondly, when the air is very moist; and thirdly, the air above is very cold. When the updraft gets stronger, so does the thunderstorm.\nFlash floods happen when slow-moving thunderstorms pour down much more water than usual in a small area. It rains so hard that the water can not soak into the ground fast enough, and the water rushes down the mountainsides or hills into streams and rivers. These streams and rivers cannot carry all the water, so it quickly floods. The most severe flash flood makes the water level rise dangerously in streams, dry places, or canyons. Flash floods can make terrible mud slides and can move very quickly. They can roll big rocks, tear out trees, and destroy buildings and bridges.\nFlash floods can also happen when two or more thunderstorms hit the same spot, one right after the other. They can happen when a dam bursts open or ice breaks up. Flash floods can also happen when it rains very hard on quickly melting snow.\nBenefits.\nThunderstorms do not do only damage; however, they can be a great help to man and all living creatures. We get lots of water for many continents during the summer. Plants receive lots of life-giving rain when they need it. Without the thunderstorms, many continents would become dry. Fish would die, crops would fail, and animals would die.\nThunderstorms are also our natural air conditioners. Hot air at the surface rises up into the high atmosphere where the heat is put out into space. Clouds give us shades, and rain can cool down a hot day. Without thunderstorms, the earth would be as much as warmer. In the summer, dust, haze, and other pollutants come together in the lower atmosphere. When the air rises, either in cumulus clouds or in thunderstorms, spreads the pollution higher up into the atmosphere. Rain from thunderstorms washes away many of these pollutants out of the air.\nLightning in thunderstorms also helps keep the electrical balance between the earth and the atmosphere. Lightning is also fertilizer. When it splits through the sky, it changes nitrogen gas in the air to nitrogen compounds. These fall to the ground and are added to the soil. Nitrogen is one of the main ingredients in fertilizer. Ten percent of the nitrogen fertilizer needed for farming is made by lightning.\nSo, even though thunderstorms are dangerous, they can be a great help. They give summer water, cool the earth, and clean the air. Lightning balances the earth's electricity and helps fertilize the soil. And after a thunderstorm, sometimes there is a rainbow.\nKeeping safe in a storm.\nSome tips to keep safe in a thunderstorm are:"}

December 20, 1812; was a Lemhi Shoshone woman, who went along with the Lewis and Clark Expedition as an interpreter and guide. Lewis and Clark explored the Western United States with her, traveling thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean between 1804 and 1806.\nCultural significance.\nSacagawea is well remembered today. When many people think about Lewis and Clark today, they also think about Sacagawea.\nIn 2000, the United States Mint issued the Sacagawea dollar coin in her honor, showing Sacagawea and her son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau. The face on the coin was made to look like a modern Shoshone-Bannock woman named Randy'L He-dow Teton. This was because nobody knows exactly what Sacagawea looked like.\nIn 2001, she was given the title of Honorary Sergeant, Regular Army, by President Bill Clinton.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nThere is little information that is definitively known about Sacagawea.\nAt about thirteen years of age, Sacagawea was taken as a wife by Toussaint Charbonneau, a Quebecer trapper living in the village. He had also taken another young Shoshone named Otter Woman as a wife.\nThe Lewis and Clark expedition.\nSacagawea was pregnant with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804\u20131805. Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan. They interviewed several trappers who might be able to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter when they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone, as they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at the headwaters of the Missouri.\nLewis wrote in his journal on November 4, 1804: \nCharbonneau and Sacagawea moved into the expedition's fort a week later. Clark nicknamed her Janey. Lewis wrote about the birth of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau on February 11, 1805.\nIn April, the expedition left Fort Mandan and headed up the Missouri River in \"pirogues\". They had to be poled against the current and sometimes pulled from the riverbanks. On May 14, 1805, Sacagawea rescued items that had fallen out of a capsized boat, including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark. The corps commanders, who praised her quick action, named the Sacagawea River in her honor on May 20.\nBy August 1805, the corps had found a Shoshone tribe and was trying to trade for horses to cross the Rocky Mountains. They used Sacagawea to interpret and discovered that the tribe's chief was her brother Cameahwait.\nLewis recorded their reunion in his journal:\nAnd Clark in his:\nThe Shoshone agreed to trade horses to the group, and to provide guides to lead them over the cold and barren Rocky Mountains. The trip was so hard that they were had to eat candles just to live. When they went down into the more temperate regions on the other side, Sacagawea helped to find and cook camas roots to help them get their strength back.\nAs the expedition approached the mouth of the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast, Sacagawea gave up her beaded belt to let the captains trade for a fur robe they wanted to give to President Thomas Jefferson.\nOn the trip back, they came near the Rocky Mountains in July 1806. On July 6, Clark wrote \"The Indian woman informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well... She said we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction...\" which is now Gibbons Pass. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea told Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass. This was later chosen as the best route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.\nWhile Sacagawea has been thought of as a guide for the expedition, she probably only gave directions a few times. Her work as an interpreter certainly helped the party to talk with the Shoshone. However, the most important thing she did for the group may have been being there during the hard journey, which showed they did not want to attack any Native Americans they came across. While traveling through what is now Franklin County, Washington, Clark noted, \"The Indian woman confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter,\" and, \"the wife of Shabono our interpreter we find reconciles all the Indians, as to our friendly intentions a woman with a party of men is a token of peace.\"\nLater life and death.\nAfter the expedition, Charbonneau and Sacagawea spent three years among the Hidatsa before accepting William Clark's invitation to live in St. Louis, Missouri in 1809.\nSacagawea gave birth to a daughter, Lizette, sometime after 1810. According to Bonnie \"Spirit Wind-Walker\" Butterfield, historical documents say that Sacagawea died in 1812 of an unknown sickness: \nAs further proof that Sacagawea died in 1812, Butterfield writes:\n\"An adoption document made in the Orphans Court Records in St. Louis, Missouri states, 'On August 11, 1813, William Clark became the guardian of 'Tousant Charbonneau, a boy about ten years, and Lizette Charbonneau, a girl about one year old.' For a Missouri State Court at the time, to designate a child as orphaned and to allow an adoption, both parents had to be confirmed dead in court papers.\""}

A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving data from or to the other node in the network.\nOther devices are often needed for the network to work correctly. Examples for such devices include hubs and switches. Different kinds of network can be connected to each other with a router. In general, networks that use cables to connect can operate at higher speeds than those using wireless technology.\nA Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers which are close together. Building a LAN is easier than connecting different networks (by a Wide Area Network). The largest Wide Area Network is the Internet. (Different Area Networks are classified based on their range.)\nComputers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The \"local area network\" in a small business is usually connected to the \"corporate network\" of the larger company. These connections may allow access to the \"Internet\". For example, a shop may use it to show merchandise on its Web site through a web server, or to convert received orders into shipping instructions.\nA network must be connected with appropriate hardware. This can be wired or wireless. For a simple LAN, computers, media and peripherals are sufficient. WANs (wide area networks) and some large LANs (local area networks) need some additional devices like a bridge, gateway or router to connect different small or large networks.\nA network needs a communication protocol (a system for exchanging messages between computing systems.) Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use TCP/IP. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the 20th century, but use TCP/IP now.\nNetwork models.\nOne large network of communication technology would be difficult to implement. As a result, we split up various components of the network into smaller modules or layers. The standard model of a network is the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model set by the International Organization Standard (ISO). \nOther network models exist, though they are all split into similar layers. Each layer uses the services that the layer below provides, while providing services for the layer above it. Each layer can only communicate with the same layer on the destination device. \nOSI model.\nOSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a 7-layer network model specified by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) norm and is widely used all around the world. The concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman, Honeywell information Services. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, NPLNET, EIN and CYCLADES networks and the work in IFIP WG6.1.\nLayer 1.\nThe physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. It also specifies modulated and baseband transmission.\nBaseband.\nBaseband is digital data in their raw form (in binary, the language understood by the computer in the form of 0s and 1s - 1001 1101 1010 0011). This allows very fast and reliable transmission over short distances; however, the media tend to make the bits interfere with each other, the range of baseband transmission is very limited. It becomes worse with increasing speed. Baseband technology is frequently used on LAN.\nTypical technology: Ethernet cables\nModulated transmission.\nIn telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted. The device that provides modulation of the baseband signal is called a modulator, and the device that provides demodulation of the modulated signal back to baseband is called a demodulator. Today, the modulator and demodulator are integrated into one device called Modem (modulator-demodulator). Frequently used on WAN, WLAN, WWAN.\nTypical technology: WI-FI, ADSL, cable TV connection (CATV)\nLayer 2.\nThe data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.\nLayer 3.\nThe network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network using the IP address.\nIP address.\nAn Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. At present there are two versions of protocols in use \u2013 IPv4 and IPv6.\nLayer 4.\nThe transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.\nLayers 5-7.\nCommonly united into one layer in simplified network models, its main purpose is to interact with applications, encrypting and establishing dedicated connections if necessary.\nNetworking terms.\nLatency.\nLatency, incorrectly called ping, is a value that measures how much time packets need to travel to their destination. It is measured in miliseconds (ms). The tool that measures latency is called ping, commonly using special ICMP packets which are smaller than standard data packets so they do not weight the network by their presence.\nCapacity (bandwidth).\nCapacity is a measure of transfer capacity of a network and is measured in bits per second (bps or b/s), today commonly Mbps or Mb/s. It shows us how many data units are transferred each second. At present, the average bandwidth is far higher than is necessary and it is not a limiting factor in most cases.\nBroadcast.\nBroadcast is a special transmission that is not meant for a single device but is addressed to all devices in specific network. It is mostly used to automatically issue IP addresses to devices by a DHCP server and to create an ARP table that maps the network and speeds up the traffic."}

It has a population of 29,524. It is located where the Trent and the Neuse rivers meet. The city is east of Raleigh and northeast of Wilmington. New Bern is the county seat of Craven County. New Bern is the birthplace of the international drink, Pepsi Cola.\nNew Bern was a Native American town named Chattoka. Swiss immigrants moved to New Bern in 1710. It was named after the capital of Switzerland: Bern. \"Bern\" is bear in the German language, and the flags of both towns have the drawing of a bear.\nNew Bern is the second oldest town in North Carolina. It was the capital of the North Carolina colonial government and the state capital for a short time until 1792. After the American Revolution, New Bern became rich and quickly developed a rich cultural life. At one time New Bern was called \"the Athens of the South.\" After Raleigh was named as the state capital, New Bern rebuilt its economy with the help of trade routes to the Caribbean and New England. It reached a population of 3,600 in 1815. During the 19th-century Federal period, New Bern was the largest city in North Carolina.\nNew Bern has four historic districts with homes, stores and churches dating back to the early eighteenth century. Close to the waterfront are more than 164 homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also nearby are several bed and breakfast inns, hotels, restaurants, banks, antiques stores and specialty shops. Tryon Palace, the home of British governor William Tryon, was built in 1770. It was used as the original state capitol building of newly independent North Carolina. It burned down in the 1790s. People can now visit a replica, built from the original plans and on the original foundation. The Masonic Temple and the Athens Theater are both still very active today. The Masonic Theater is the oldest theater in America in continuous use.\nThe historic districts also are home to many of the town's 2,000 crape myrtles \u2014 New Bern\u2019s official flower \u2014 and gardens. The district has flowering dogwoods and azaleas.\nUnion Point park is where the Neuse and Trent Rivers join. It is the city\u2019s major celebration spot for events such as Neuse River Days and the Fourth of July. In 1979, the local government gave Swiss Bear Downtown Revitalization Corp \u2014 a nonprofit corporation of civic leaders \u2014 control of the failing downtown area. Today, art galleries, specialty shops, antiques stores, restaurants and inns have changed downtown and the waterfront into a social hub. Improvements are still being made.

The footprint is then compared to the amount of natural resources nature can renew. The ecological footprint takes into account how much farm land, forest area, grazing land and sea area it takes to provide everything people use. More simply, footprint calculations answer the questions: how much nature do we have? And how much do we use?\nWhen analyzing the world as a whole, humanity is using nature about 1.7 times faster than nature renews itself. It is like using 1.7 planet Earths. Since people consume differently around the world, it is also possible to calculate how many planet it would take if everybody around the world consumed like a particular population. For instance, if everybody consumed like the Germans, it would take nearly 3 planet Earths. Expressed in area: The ecological footprint per world citizen is about 2.8 global average hectares per person while there are only 1.6 global hectare of biologically productive land and water per person on Earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 70% and now lives unsustainably by depleting stocks of \"natural capital\". \nAll this data is based on the 2020 assessment from Global Footprint Network, York University, and FoDaFo. It uses 2017 data."}

These goods and services may be needed around the entire world. A water footprint can be determined by math for any well-established group of users, or producers. It is measured by dividing the total amount of water used, by the water that became polluted, in the same area during the same amount of time. While the water footprint of an organization is a good indicator for its water consumption and pollution, it does not show how other water sources are affected. More studies will need to be done in order to determine the effect of the water footprint on water sources.\nEtymology.\nThe water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by A.Y. Hoekstra from UNESCO-IHE as an alternative indicator of water use.[2]. The concept was refined and accounting methods were established with a series of publications from two lead authors A.K. Chapagain and A.Y. Hoekstra from the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, now at WWF-UK and University of Twente respectively. The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004-report on the 'Water footprint of nations' from UNESCO-IHE [3] and the 2008-book Globalization of Water by A.Y. Hoekstra and A.K. Chapagain, published by Blackwell, 2008. Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008 that aims to coordinate efforts to further develop and disseminate knowledge on water footprint concepts, methods and tools."}

The two main species are both called 'trembling aspens' or 'quaking aspens' on account of their leaves.\nAmerican aspen.\nPopulus tremuloides is the American aspen. It is common in temperate and colder regions of North America.\nIt forms large stands (groups) of genetically identical trees (clones) connected by a single underground root system. These trees form through root sprouts coming off an original parent tree. The largest known fully connected aspen is a grove in Utah nicknamed 'Pando', and some experts call it the largest organism in the world, by mass or volume. It covers 0.43\u00a0km2 (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh .\nEuropean aspen.\nPopulus tremula is a species of poplar native to cool temperate regions of Europe and Asia, from the British Isles east to Kamchatka, north to inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and south to central Spain, Turkey, the Tian Shan mountain system, North Korea, and northern Japan. It also occurs at one site in northwest Africa in Algeria. In the south of its range, it occurs at high altitudes in mountains.\nIt is a hardy species which tolerates long, cold winters and short summers. Aspen is dioecious, so individual trees are either male or female (in contrast to most trees, where male and female flowers occur on the same tree). Trees flower in March and April, before the leaves appear, with both the male and female trees producing catkins. Pollinated female catkins ripen in early summer and release tiny seeds which are tufted with hairs.\nLike other aspens, its main method of reproduction is vegetative (asexual). It spreads extensively by root sprouts, which may be produced up to 40 metres from the parent tree. They form extensive clonal colonies. Large numbers of new shoots can be produced in this way, especially after a major disturbance such as fire."}

Its total sales reached 684,226 cars in 2009 and 85,000 for the month of March 2011.\nHistory.\n\u0160koda Works was started as a firearms maker in 1859.\n\u0160koda Auto goes back to the early 1890s as a company which started out making bicycles. In 1894, 26-year old V\u00e1clav Klement (a bookseller in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav) could not find any spare parts to fix his bicycle. Klement returned his bicycle to the makers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter. It was written in Czech. The letter asked the company to repair the bicycle. When Klement got his reply, it was in German. It said (in English): \"If you would like an answer to your inquiry, you should try writing in a language we can understand\". Klement was very unhappy at this. Even though he did not have any experience, he decided to start a bicycle repair shop. He and V\u00e1clav Laurin opened this in 1895 in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav. Before working with Klement, Laurin was a bicycle maker in the town of Turnov. Turnov was near to Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav. In 1898, after moving to their newly-built factory, the pair bought a Werner \"motorcyclist\". It was made by French manufacturer Werner Brothers. Laurin &amp; Klement's first motorcyclette was powered by an engine on the handlebars. It drove the front wheels. It was dangerous and unreliable. Laurin had an accident on it, and lost one of his front teeth. To design a safer motorcycle, the pair wrote to German specialist Robert Bosch for advice. The pair's new motorcycle went on sale in 1899.\nIn 1900, when the company had 32 people working for them, motorcycles began being exported. 150 machines were shipped to London. Shortly after, the press said that they were the makers of the first motorcycle. The first model, Voiturette A, was a success. The company was set up both within Austria-Hungary and all over the world. By 1905 the company was making automobiles.\nAfter World War I, the Laurin-Klement company began making trucks. However, in 1924, the company looked for a partner after running into problems. It was bought by \u0160koda Works, a firearms maker. Most things made later were under the \u0160koda name. \u0160koda was successful again after an economic depression. The \"Popular\" in the late 1930s is an example of a popular car.\nDuring World War II, when Nazi Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia, the \u0160koda works was turned into part of \"Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring\". It helped the German war effort.\nCar models.\nThis table shows the \u0160koda car models still being made."}

They say that the Rohingya are Bengalis and do not belong in the country. Because of this, Rohingyas cannot do things that other people in Burma can, such as go to school and vote.\nIn the 2010s, the Burmese government started to put the Rohingya in concentration camps and not allow them to leave.

The band was formed in Helsinki in 1986. The original members were K\u00e4rtsy Hatakka, Sale Suomalainen and Jariot Lehtinen. Their name is a reference to popular Finish writer Mika Waltari \u2013 a favorite author of band\u2019s guitarist Jariot Lethinen. \nWaltari is more famous in the rest of Europe than in Finland and the band members have very positive relationships to Czech Republic. They\u2019ve collaborated with Czech punk rock band Wohnout and K\u00e4rtsy is a good friend of Lenka Dusilov\u00e1. The band has collaborated with many other artists. They\u2019ve made albums with Finnish ethno band Angelit, they hosted on Apocalyptica\u2019s album and Tarja Turunen from Nightwish was a part of Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! live performance.\nMusicial style.\nWaltari's music is well known for it\u2019s destruction of rock and metal genre boundaries. Their heavy sound is often combined with elements of electronic music, pop, rap, disco, funk, grindcore and bits of many other genres and creates a fusion which can be described as avant-garde. The lead singer and bass guitarist, K\u00e4rtsy Hattaka, delivers very distinctive vocal part to their music and makes Waltari's sound even more unique and easily recognizable. \nLyrics.\nWaltari\u2019s lyrics are as diverse as their music. They\u2019re about various range of topics including everyday misery, personal struggles, science fiction motives, and music industry philosophical questions. They have one thing in common \u2013 heavy irony, self-irony and sarcasm. \nAlbums.\nWaltari started their musical career with demo records. The longest one was \"Monk Punk\". This album presents an interesting mixture of punk and funk music, but the first release which provided the band more positive reviews was the album called \"Torcha!\" and it was also the first one which combined bits of many musical genres. It also includes the cover of Madonna\u2019s song \"Vogue\".\nNext two albums, \"So Fine\" and \"Big Bang\" were also very successful. They mainly concentrate on mixing heavy metal with techno, which was something fresh and innovative. Their biggest success among death metal fans yet came with the \"Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die!\" album, which is mixture of death metal and classical music. It also has a musical feeling to it, because it\u2019s kind of an epic story from future sung in dialogues of various characters. \nNext album \"Space Avenue\" is more electronic and it has some pop feeling to it. Another one called \"Radium Round\" goes even further in that. It\u2019s almost a pop/disco album with some metal elements. Waltari returned to more rock sound with albums like \"Rare Species\" and very successful \"Blood Sample\". Last two albums \u2013 \"Release Date\" and \"Below Zero\" are mainly focused on heavy sound with bits of progressive rock. "}

{"id": "316916", "revid": "982025", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316916", "title": "Multiple sclerosis", "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time. In this disease, the body\u2019s natural guard against illness (the immune system) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the nerve cells (neurons) in the central nervous system (CNS). The disease has different effects in different people, and can make people\u2019s bodies, eyesight, speech, and minds work poorly. People with MS do not normally live as long as healthy people.\nIn healthy people, myelin sheaths help neurons work. Electric signals in neurons move quickly through long, narrow axons like electricity in a wire. The myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end. In people with MS, infiltration of immune cells causes inflammation within the CNS resulting in the loss of the protective insulator, called \"demyelination.\" The progressive loss of the myelin sheath, as well as the loss of myelin-producing cells, impair the ability of the body to regrow its myelin. Without the protective covering, the signals between neurons do not travel well. Because of this, the mind and body cannot work like they normally do.\nPossible causes.\nScientists and doctors do not know for certain the cause of MS, but they think some things put some people at a higher risk for MS:\nResearch about the causes of MS is still incomplete. Some scientists think that a relatively unknown pathogen called Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause MS. Also, some viruses can cause myelin damage, there are other viruses that have been shown to make people more likely to get MS. Even though scientists and doctors have theories, no one has found one cause that explains every case of the disease.\nSymptoms.\nQuite a few forms of MS exist, which can create difficulty in deciding how to manage the illness. The disease damages myelin. Sometimes, the body can do limited repairs to myelin. When this happens, symptoms (the problems caused by the disease) go away for a short time. This is called remission. When the body attacks the myelin again, the symptoms return and this is called relapse. The type of MS that has remissions and relapses is called Remitting-Relapsing MS. In less common cases, the body continues attacking myelin and the symptoms get worse rapidly, a form called \"Primary Progressive MS\". Sometimes a combination of the two types of disease can occur simultaneously.\nPeople with MS have many problems. Their muscles are usually weak, they may shake uncontrollably, they have trouble moving, and they have trouble balancing. People with MS often feel a great amount of pain and tire easily. Their speech and sight sometimes become very poor. Thinking and solving problems is more difficult for people with MS than for healthy people. \nInside the body, MS causes damage that cannot be seen or measured without special medical equipment. The immune system attacks either the fatty parts of the myelin or the protein parts of the myelin. The body may also attack the cells that produce the myelin sheath, called glial cells. When myelin is damaged or missing, large areas of axons affected by the damage are visible as scars or lesions in the central nervous system tissue that build up with repeated repair attempts by the body over time. Lesions appear in different areas of the central nervous system depending on what form of MS a person has.\nInflammation is an important part of MS symptoms. Inflammation occurs whenever an injury or illness is detected by the body. It is the first part of an immune system response. In MS patients, inflammation against myelin causes swelling and other harmful effects in the nervous system. Inflammation can happen due to infection by Chlamydia Pneumoniae. \nPeople with MS.\nThe people who get MS are usually between 20 and 40 years old, although it can happen to older or, very rarely, younger people too. MS is significantly more common in areas of the world that are far away from the equator. Areas far from the equator get less sunlight than areas near the equator, and the human body requires sunlight to make vitamin D for itself. This observation supports the idea that MS is caused partly by too little vitamin D. People who move from one part of the world to another when they are children are more likely to develop MS than people who do not move long distances until later in life or who never move long distances.\nDiagnosis.\nTo diagnose MS, or to tell if a person has it, a doctor will determine what kind of symptoms are present and how often they occur. The most common guidelines used for this are called the McDonald criteria, which define the symptoms of MS and how often they must occur in order to make a diagnosis. A doctor can also order tests to be done by a laboratory, which can determine how active the immune system is in the patient. A special machine called an MRI can photograph the inside of the central nervous system to show if the person has lesions from damaged myelin. Certain types of neurons can be checked to see how responsive they are. Neurons with damaged myelin around their axons will respond more slowly than normal neurons.\nTreatment.\nOnce a person is diagnosed with MS, a doctor can help ease the symptoms. Scientists have not yet found a way to cure MS, or take it away entirely. The form of MS that comes and goes regularly can be treated more easily than other forms. Some treatments are used only during attacks to make the attacks easier on the patient or to help recovery after the attacks are over. Other treatments are used all the time to help make attacks happen less often. These kinds of treatments are usually injections or infusions directly into veins, but newer treatments can be taken daily by mouth instead. Some people seek other treatments outside of usual medicine, but these have not been shown in scientific studies to be effective."}

He worked as an adviser to his father.\nPresidency.\nWhen Bashar's father died, the government changed the constitution. Under Syrian law the president had to be at least 40 years old. With the law changed, Assad was able to be elected President of Syria in June 2000. He was also made commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and leader of the Ba'ath Party which has ruled Syria since 1961.\nSyrian Civil War.\nLarge protests began in January 2011. The protesters wanted political reforms, an end to the state of emergency (which had been in place since 1963), and the return of civil rights. The protests in March were the largest to take place, and the government used violence against the protestors.\nThe United States placed sanctions against the Assad government in April 2011. Canada and the European Union also placed sanctions against the government in May 2011.\nIn June 2011, Assad promised reform, a new parliarmentary election, and more freedoms. He also urged refugees to return to Syria.\nIn January 2012, Reuters claimed that over 5,000 civilians and protesters (including militants) had been killed by the Syrian army, security agents and militia, while 1,100 people had been killed by terrorists.\nIn January 2012, Assad gave a speech in which he claimed that the uprising was being engineered by foreign countries. He said that a new referendum could be held in March.\nThe referendum was held in February 2012. The referendum would change the term limits of future Syrian presidents. It passed with 90% support. The U.S. and Turkey did not accept the results. The European Union pushed new sanctions on the government.\nIn June 2012, the ICRC announced that Syria was in a civil war. The national death toll on both sides reached 20,000.\nIn 2014 and 2015, he began to lose some support from the Alawite community. This was because an unequal number of soldiers killed in the conflict were Alawites.\nIn September 2015, Russia got involved in the Syrian Civil War. President of Russia Vladimir Putin said that Russia's goal in Syria is to \"stabilis[e] the legitimate power in Syria and creat[e] the conditions for political compromise.\" In November 2015, Assad said that the two months of Russian intervention had accomplished more than the U.S.-led coalition had done in a year.\nIn December 2016, government forces recovered most of Aleppo from rebel forces.\nAfter the election of Donald Trump, the U.S. no longer wished to remove Assad from power. That changed after the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. Donald Trump ordered missile strikes to hit a Syrian airbase. Assad responded by saying that the United States's behaviour was an \"unjust and arrogant aggression.\" He also said that the Syrian army had given up all its chemical weapons in 2013. He claimed that the chemical attack was a lie and was used to justify a U.S. airstrike.\nAs of March 2018, between 350,000 and 511,000 people have been killed in the civil war.\nPersonal life.\nAssad is married to Asma al-Akhras. Together, they have three children; Hafez, Jr., Zein, and Karim al-Assad.\nInfluenced by his western education and urban upbringing, Bashar initially seemed eager to implement a cultural revolution in Syria."}

In numerical control, the commands these machines get come from a storage medium; they are not controlled and operated manually. The first such machines were Jacquard looms controlled by punched cards. Machine tools for cutting metal were built in the 1940s and 1950s. They used punched tape instructions. Soon, the tools were changed, to use computers. Numerical control with computers is known as Computer Numerical Control, or CNC.\nNowadays, it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools, based on a CAD drawing of the piece to be produced.\nAttempts to automate machines in the 19th century, for example copying-lathes, used cams. These are basically wheels that change the position of notches to control a machine. The basic difference to modern NC is that these cams only automated one given task; modern NC and CNC machines can be programmed to a greater extent.\nHistory of the NC.\nThe invention of numerical control has been due to the pioneering works of John T. Parsons in the year 1940, when he tried to generate a curve automatically by milling cutters by providing coordinate motions. In the late 1940s Parsons conceived the method of using punched cards containing coordinate position system to control a machine tool. The machine directed to move in small increments and generate the desired finish. In 1948, Parsons demonstrated this concept to the US Air Force, who sponsored the series of project at laboratories of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After research MIT was able to demonstrate first NC prototype in 1952 and in the next year they were able to prove the potential applications of the NC.\nCNC Milling Materials.\nOne of the most usual material types for milling are metals, and there are many to select from."}

The first known use of the word was somewhere in the 1400s where they were simply called crows or iron crows.\nIt is used as a lever either to force apart two objects or to remove nails. Crowbars are commonly used to open nailed wooden crates. Common uses for larger crowbars are: removing nails, prying apart boards, and generally breaking things. Crowbars can be used as any of the three lever classes but the curved end is usually used as a first-class lever, and the flat end as a second class lever.

It is part of a world-wide system of mid-ocean ridges. These ridges make up the longest mountain range in the world, all underwater except for short stretches like Iceland. On Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reaches the surface.\nThe ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates, and moves the plates apart at about 2.5\u00a0cm per year.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length. At the rift, the boundary between tectonic plates, magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor. New magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro.\nHistory.\nThe ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS \"Challenger\" in 1872. A team of scientists on board discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic. They were planning the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable. The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925\nIn the 1950s, mapping of the Earth\u2019s ocean floors showed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to have valleys and ridges. Its central valley is seismologically active and the epicentre of many earthquakes. Ewing and Heezen discovered the ridge to be part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earth\u2019s oceans. The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegener's theory of continental drift and expansion as plate tectonics.\nGeology.\nThe ridge started forming in at the end of the Triassic period, and was responsible for the separation of the Americas from Africa and Europe with the breakup of Pangaea.\nThe ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing up the oceanic crust and lithosphere."}

This way of designing buildings came out of the rebuilding of Japan after World War II. Members of the group include: Kiyoshi Awazu, Noboru Kawazoe, Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa, Fumihiko Maki, Masato Otaka, and Kenz\u014d Tange. They wrote a short book in English and Japanese called \"The proposals for a New Urbanism\" for the World Design Conference in 1960. Many Metabolist projects or designs were very large city plans called \"megastructures\". The members thought of cities as living things that changed over long periods of time.\nThese architects were interested in building housing for large numbers of people. They often planned buildings that could be changed. One example is the Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kurokawa (1972). Each apartment was a rectangular block with one round window. These blocks could be added, moved, or removed as needed. It was a \"plug-in building\". Kurokawa planned for new, better capsules to be added to replace old ones. However, people living in the tower plan to tear it down and rebuild a larger building. "}

It was the first modular capsule building.\nDesign and construction.\nThe building is actually two towers. One is eleven and the other is thirteen floors. These towers are the utility cores. They have the elevators, stairs, electric, and water services in them. They also support the whole building. 140 capsules are attached to the two cores. Each capsule unit is one apartment or office. They are \u00d7 \u00d7 and have one round window. Just four bolts connect each unit to a tower. The units are made from lightweight steel. They were built in Shiga Prefecture and brought to Tokyo on trucks. The capsules are not connected to each other, so any capsule can be removed or replaced without moving the others.\nThe towers are the permanent part of the building and the capsules were temporary. Kurokawa planned for new units to be built to replace old ones. As building technology improved, better units could be added. Also, units could be changed as people moved in or out. Capsules could even be moved from one building to another. This part of the plan never happened. No new capsules were ever built.\nResidents plan to tear down the building. They say there are problems with asbestos and that the building is too old and has not been repaired well. Kurokawa and other architects want to keep the building as an historic example."}

The protesters were angry that their countries did not give them many rights. They also felt that, because of the governments, their quality of life was poor.\nThe Arab Spring resulted in many leadership changes. By 2012, most of the governments involved had either been defeated and replaced or had stopped the protests.\nA few years after the Arab Spring stopped, the Arab Winter began. Many countries went back to having leaders that limited rights and many terrorist groups were made. Many protests have continued.\nWhere.\nThe protests forced rulers out of power in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya and Yemen. Civil uprisings occurred in Bahrain and Syria. Large protests happened in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco and Sudan. Smaller protests happened in Mauritania, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Western Sahara and Palestine. There were minor protests in countries that are not part of the Arab World, such as Iran and Israel.\nThere were border clashes in Israel. Protests in Iranian Khuzestan by the Arab minority occurred in 2011. Weapons and Tuareg fighters returning from the Libyan civil war had encouraged a conflict in Mali in North Africa. The clashes in Lebanon were described as a spillover of violence from the Syrian uprising.\nWhat.\nThe protests shared some techniques of civil resistance in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, and rallies. They were also effective at using social media to organize, communicate, and raise awareness against state attempts at repression and Internet censorship.\nMany Arab Spring demonstrations were met with violent responses from authorities, as well as from pro-government militias and counter-demonstrators. These attacks were answered with violence from protestors in some cases. A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world was \"Ash-sha`b yurid isqat an-nizam\" (\"the people want to bring down the regime\").\nSome observers compared the Arab Spring movements to the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in Eastern Europe or the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.\nOrigin of term.\nThe first specific use of the term \"Arab Spring\" as used to signify these events may have started with the American political journal \"Foreign Policy\". Marc Lynch, referring to his article in \"Foreign Policy\", writes \"Arab Spring\u2014a term I may have unintentionally coined in a January 6, 2011 article\". Joseph Massad on \"Al Jazeera\" said the term was \"part of a US strategy of controlling [the movement's] aims and goals\" and directing it towards American-style liberal democracy. Due to the electoral success of Islamist parties before protests began in many Arab countries, the events have also come to be known as \"Islamist Spring\" or \"Islamist Winter\".\nArab winter.\nThe series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa has become known as the \"Arab Spring\", and sometimes as the \"Arab Spring and Winter\" even though not all the participants in the protests are Arab. It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in Tunisia on 18 December 2010 following Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in protest of police corruption and ill treatment. The protests also triggered similar unrest outside the region resembling a 'chain effect'."}

Historically, it was known to Westerners as Canton, which is a misnomer, or a mistake in naming, since the name is an older English pronunciation for the entire region that the city is in, Guangdong. It is also called the City of Flowers. It is in the south of China and is one of the five biggest cities in China. In mainland China, Guangzhou is regarded as one of the three most popular cities with Beijing and Shanghai, which is called Bei-Shang-Guang for short. It is where the 16th Asian Games were held and it is famous for its food all over the world.\nGeography.\nGuangzhou is the core city of South China. It is on the north of Zhu Jiang Delta (Pearl River Delta), where the Dong Jiang River (East River), Xi Jiang River (West River) and Bei Jiang River (North River) join together. On its South is the South China Sea. With its geographical advantages, Guangzhou has been a very important port in South China for hundreds of years. Today, it is the biggest and most important port for air, sea, and trains in China. The area of Guangzhou is about . The north part and middle part of Guangzhou are hills. The west part and south part are plains that have a lot of rivers and streams. Guangzhou is in the subtropics monsoon climate region. It has a lot of sunshine and rain. The average temperature is from 21.4 to 21.9\u00a0\u00b0C (about 71\u00a0\u00b0F) and the lowest temperature in winter is about . The rainy season lasts for almost six months and the typhoons in summer also bring lots of rain. The average humidity is about 77 percent.\nGuangzhou has Baiyun Airport, which is one of the three most important parts of air transportation in the country. The passenger throughput ranks third in China and 19th in the world. It is also a very important harbor in China, second to Shenzhen in South China and the fourth one in the country. With the Jing-Guang Railway, Jing-Jiu Railway, Guang-Shen Railway and other railways, Guangzhou has become one of the four biggest railway passenger stations in China. A high speed railway has been built here.\nEconomy.\nGuangzhou has been the city famous for business for hundreds of years. It has been open to the world for nearly 2000 years. After the Reform and Opening Up in 1979, Guangzhou has gained great economic achievement. For example, Guangzhou's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) has grown about 14% per year. It ranks as the third economic city in China (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). In addition, Guangzhou has become a city with a sound industrial foundation and developed tertiary-industry. In September of 1993, Guangzhou was accepted as a member of the World Association of Metropolises.\nThe most important elements of Guangzhou\u2019s economy are light manufacturing sector and foreign trade. They are the main reasons for Guangzhou\u2019s economic achievement and its attraction to appeal people from all over the world to begin their own business in this city. Every year, the China Import and Export Commodities Fair (Guangzhou Fair) is held here. It has the biggest conference and exhibition center, Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center, in Asia. After 2000, Guangzhou began to change its industrial structure and increase its investment in the heavy manufacturing sector. Nowadays, the automobile industry, petrochemical industry, and the IT industry have been the three mainstay industries in Guangzhou.\nCulture and Education.\nGuangzhou is a typical city for Lingnan Culture. The main characters of Lingnan Culture are open-mindedness, practical spirit and civilian consciousness. People here don\u2019t adhere to traditional rules. They combine culture from different parts in the world with the local culture and are creating new culture to adjust to the modern world. This is very different from the Center Plains Culture in the north part of China. Guangzhou has its own opera, Guangdong Opera, and its own language, Cantonese. In Guangzhou Metro, you can hear the announcement for station not only in Chinese and English, but also in Cantonese. Besides, sotto portico is the typical construction for Lingnan Culture. A flowers market held every Spring Festival is famous around South China.\nThe education in Guangzhou began in the Western Han Dynasty. Now, Guangzhou is one of the cities with the most colleges and universities in the South China. It is one of the cities which has the most education resource in the country. The best comprehensive university here is Sun Yat-sen University. It is a university built in memory of Sun Yat-sen, who led the Xinhai Revolution and is regarded as the father of China."}

These lamps produce light by sending electricity through an ionized gas. Most of these lamps use a noble gas, or a combination of noble gases, but they often contain other materials, such as mercury, sodium or metal halides. The gases in these lamps are ionized in operation. This means that there are free electrons. When an electric current is sent through the gas, electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals. This will mean that some reach a higher energy state. When they fall back into the lower energy state, they will emit the energy in the form of light. \nThe fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp. Sodium vapor lamps are commonplace as streetlights.\nGas-discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency, but they are more complicated to manufacture, which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps. Due to their greater efficiency, gas-discharge lamps replacing incandescent light bulbs for many purposes in the late 20th century. Early in the 21st century, light-emitting diodes improved, with even higher efficiency. They began to replace some gas discharge lamps. "}

Her \"Ball 'n' Chain\" album in 1968 with Lightnin' Hopkins (guitar) and Larry Williams (vocals), included the songs \"Hound Dog\", \"Wade in the Water\", \"Little Red Rooster\", \"Ball 'n' Chain\", \"Money Taker\", and \"Prison Blues\".\nOne of Thornton's last albums was \"Jail\" (1975) for Vanguard Records.The album was recorded in the mid-1970s at two prisons. She became the leader of a blues ensemble .Thornton performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 and 1968, and at the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1979. In 1965 she performed with the American Folk Blues Festival package in Europe where she recorded her album \"Big Mama Thornton in Europe\" and followed it up the next year in San Francisco with \"Big Mama Thornton with the Chicago Blues Band\". Both albums came out on the Arhoolie label. Thornton continued to record for Vanguard, Mercury, and other small labels in the 1970s and to work the blues festival circuit until her death in 1984. She was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984.\nThornton died of a heart attack in Los Angeles on 25 July 1984 at the age of 57."}

{"id": "317385", "revid": "7380028", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317385", "title": "Ballistic coefficient", "text": "In ballistics, the ballistic coefficient (BC) of a bullet is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight. A high BC means the object will slow down less. It will have more of its speed left when it reaches the target. BC depends on mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. Ballistic coefficient has units of lb/in\u00b2 or kg/m\u00b2. BCs for bullets are normally stated in lb/in\u00b2 by their manufacturers without referring to this unit. The values for BC can be as low as 0.12 and as high as 1.00 for commonly used bullets.\nBullet performance.\nA bullet with a high BC will travel farther than one with a low BC since it will keep its speed better, resist the wind better, and \u201cshoot flatter\u201d (see external ballistics).\nWhen hunting with a rifle, a higher BC is good for several reasons. A higher BC results in a flatter flight. The effect of mistakes in estimating the distance to the target is smaller for bullet with a higher BC. This is important when attempting an effective hit on a game animal. If the target animal is closer than estimated, then the bullet will hit higher than expected. On the other hand, if the animal is further than estimated the bullet will hit lower than expected. Such a difference in bullet drop can make the difference between a clean kill and a wounded animal.\nThis difference in flight path becomes more important at longer distances. Sometimes, the difference in two bullet designs fired from the same rifle can result in a difference between the two of over 30\u00a0cm (1\u00a0foot) at 500 meters (550 yards). A bullet with a high BC arrives at the target faster and with more energy than one with a low BC.\nSince the higher BC bullet gets to the target faster, it is also less affected by crosswinds.\nGeneral trends.\nSporting bullets have BC\u2019s in the range 0.12 to slightly over 1.00, with high being the most aerodynamic, and low being the least. Very-low-drag bullets with BCs \u2265 1.10 can be designed and produced on special lathes using mono-metal rods. These special bullets often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.\nBullet makers often offer several weights and types for a given size. Heavy-for-caliber pointed (spitzer) bullets with a boat tail design have high BCs. Lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs. \nIn the United States, hunting cartridges such as the .25-06 Remington (a 6.35\u00a0mm caliber), the .270 Winchester (a 6.8\u00a0mm caliber), and the .284 Winchester (a 7\u00a0mm caliber) are used when high BCs are desired.\nIn the larger sizes, the .338 Lapua Magnum and the .50 BMG are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1000 meters. They have very high BCs. Other choices in the larger size are the .375 and .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .416 Barrett.\nChanges in bullet ballistic coefficients.\nDifferences in BC claims for exactly the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the air density used for these BC statements or differing range-speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based. The BC changes during a projectile's flight and stated BCs are always averages for certain distances and speeds. Some more explanation about the transient nature of a projectile's G1 BC during flight can be found at the external ballistics article. This article suggests that knowing how a BC was established is almost as important as knowing the stated BC value itself.\nTo find the correct BC (osome scientists would call it drag coefficients), Doppler radar-measurements are required. The normal shooting or aerodynamics person, however, does not have this expensive equipment. Weibel 1000e Doppler radars are used by governments, professional ballisticians, defense forces, and a few ammunition manufacturers to get exact real world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest.\nTest results came from many shots, not just a single shot. Any single bullet can have a very different BC than another. It is important to know the average behavior of a bullet. How different speed regimes affect several rifle bullets made by Lapua can be seen in the .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established BC data.\nMathematical models and bullet ballistic coefficients.\nMost ballistic mathematical models and hence tables or software assume that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistics coefficient. Those models do not have any differences for wadcutter, flat-based, spitzer, boat-tail, very-low-drag, etc. bullet types or shapes. However, some different drag curve models have been made for several standard projectile shapes.\nFreeware small arms ballistic coefficient calculators.\nThese free computer programs can be used to calculate ballistic coefficient if other information is known."}
