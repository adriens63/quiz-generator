It is the most popular Buddhist temple in Laos.\nHistory.\nBuddhist missionaries from the Mauryan Empire are believed to have been sent by the Emperor Ashoka, including Bury Chan or Praya Chanthabury Pasithisak and five Arahata monks who brought a holy relic (believed to be the breastbone) of Lord Buddha to the stupa in the 3rd century BC. It was rebuilt in the 13th century as a Khmer temple which fell into ruin.\nIn the mid-16th century, King Setthathirat relocated his capital from Luang Prabang to Vientiane and ordered the construction of Pha That Luang in 1566. It was rebuilt about 4 km from the centre of Vientiane at the end of Pha That Luang Road and named Pha That Luang. The bases had a length of 69 metres each and was 45 metres high, and was surrounded by 30 small Stupas.\nIn 1641, a Dutch envoy of the Dutch East India Company, Gerrit van Wuysthoff, visited Vientiane and was received by King Sourigna Vongsa at the temple, where he was, reportedly, received in a magnificent ceremony. He wrote that he was particularly impressed by the \"enormous pyramid and the top was covered with gold leaf weighing about a thousand pounds\".[4] However, the stupa was repeatedly plundered by the Burmese, Siamese and Chinese.\nPha That Luang was destroyed by the Thai invasion in 1828, which left it heavily damaged and abandoned. It was not until 1900 that the French restored to its original design based on the detailed drawings from 1867 by the French architect and explorer Louis Delaporte. However the first attempt to restore it was unsuccessful and it had to be redesigned and then reconstructed in the 1930s.[3] During the Franco-Thai War, Pha That Luang was heavily damaged during a Thai air raid. After the end of World War II, the Pha That Luang was reconstructed.\nArchitecture.\nThe architecture of the building includes many references to Lao culture and identity, and so has become a symbol of Lao nationalism.\nThe first level is 223 feet (67 metres) by 226 feet (68 metres); the second is 157 feet (47 metres) along each side; and the third level is 98 feet (29 metres) along each side. From ground to pinnacle, the Pha That Luang is 147.6 feet (44 metres) high. Only the pinnacle is covered in real gold, the remainder of the stupa is painted a gold color.\nThe area around Pha That Luang is now gated, to keep traffic out. Previously visitors could drive around the whole complex. The encircling walls are roughly 279 feet (85 metres) long on each side and contain a large number of Lao and Khmer sculptures including one of Jayavarman VII.\nGallery.\nKing Jayavarman VII of the Khmer empire\nThe naga of Pha That Luang\nPha That Luang\nThe stupa of Pha That Luang\nThe stupa of Pha That Luang (inside the temple)"}

It is the capital of Siem Reap Province. This city surrounds Angkor Wat, the world's largest religious monument.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Siem Reap\" can be translated to mean 'defeat of Siam' (siem in Khmer), and is commonly taken as a reference to an incident in the centuries-old conflict between the Siamese and Khmer kingdoms, although this is probably apocryphal. According to oral tradition, King Ang Chan (1516\u20131566) had named the town \"Siem Reap\" after he repulsed an army sent to invade Cambodia by the Thai king Maha Chakkraphat in 1549. Scholars such as Michael Vickery consider this derivation to be simply a modern folk etymology, and maintain that while the names Siem Reap and Chenla. the old Chinese name for Cambodia, may perhaps be related, the actual origin of the name is unknown.\nThe traditional tale claims that King Ang Chan of Cambodia tried to assert greater independence from Siam, which was then struggling internally. The Siamese king Chairacha had been poisoned by his concubine, Lady Sri Sudachan, who had committed adultery with a commoner, Worawongsathirat, while the king was away leading a campaign against the Kingdom of Lan Na. Sudachan then placed her lover on the throne. The Thai nobility lured them outside the city on a royal procession by barge to inspect a newly discovered white elephant. After killing the usurper, along with Sudachan and their new-born daughter, they invited Prince Thianracha to leave the monkhood and assume the throne as King Maha Chakkraphat (1548\u20131569). With the Thais distracted by internal problems, King Ang Chan attacked. He seized the Siamese city of Prachinburi in 1549, sacking the city and making slaves of its inhabitants. Only then did he learn that the succession had been settled and that Maha Chakkraphat was the new ruler. Ang Chan immediately retreated to Cambodia, taking captives with him. King Maha Chakkraphat was furious over the unprovoked attack, but Burma had also chosen to invade through Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese army posed a much more serious threat, as it captured Kanchanaburi and Suphanburi. It then appeared before Ayutthaya itself.\nThe Thai army managed to defeat the Burmese, who quickly retreated through the pass. Maha Chakkraphat's thoughts then turned to Cambodia. Not only had Ang Chan attacked and looted Prachinburi, turning its people into slaves, but he also refused to give Maha Chakkraphat a white elephant he had requested, rejecting even this token of submission to Siam. Maha Chakkraphat ordered Prince Ong, the governor of Sawankhalok, to lead an expedition to punish Ang Chan and recover the Thai captives. The rival armies met, and Ang Chan killed Prince Ong with a lucky musket shot from an elephant's back. The leaderless Thai army fled, and Ang Chan allegedly captured more than 10,000 Siamese soldiers. To celebrate his great victory, King Ang Chan supposedly named the battleground \"Siem Reap\", meaning 'the total defeat of Siam'.\nPub Street, Siem Reap\nIn reality, surviving historic sources make this derivation appear unlikely, since they date the decline of Angkor to more than a century before this, when a military expedition from Ayutthaya captured and sacked Angkor Wat, which began a long period of vassal rule over Cambodia. The 1431 capture coincided with the decline of Angkor, though the reasons behind its abandonment are not clear. They may have included environmental changes and failings of the Khmer infrastructure.\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, infighting among the Khmer nobility led to periodic intervention and domination by both of Cambodia's more powerful neighbors, Vietnam and Siam. Siem Reap, along with Battambang (Phra Tabong) and Sisophon, major cities in northwest Cambodia, was under Siamese administration and the provinces were collectively known as Inner Cambodia from 1795 until 1907, when they were ceded to French Indochina. During the 18th century, under the rule of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, it was known as Nakhon Siam ('Siam's city').\nAppearance.\nSiem Reap is a cheerful city that embraces travelers like old friends. This region was the site of successive capitals of the Khmer Empire from the ninth to the 15th centuries. The ruins, collectively known as the Angkor Archaeological Park, are located about four miles north of the city center. The city surrounds Angkor Wat as well.\nGallery.\nSiem Reap at Night."}

Due to the different climate types in Azerbaijan which range from subtropical along the Caspian Sea coast, temperate further inland, and continental and subarctic in the mountains, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus. About 67% of the species growing in the whole Caucasus can be found in Azerbaijan.\nMany plant species are also native, and are found in no other country. Another reason why Azerbaijan has many plant species, many of which are relicts of the Tertiary period, is because they were not affected by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations and did not become extinct.\nThe richness of Azerbaijan's flora and the many types of its vegetation also results from its geography and topography that provide many different habitats, like mountains, plains, bodies of water, etc.\nThe ecosystems found in Azerbaijan where plant life is most widespread, are grassland (mostly in the plains), forest (mostly in the mountains), tundra (in the high mountains) and wetland.\nThe forest is the ecosystem which has the most number of plant species in Azerbaijan. The forests are found mostly in the Caucasus Mountains, which have a lot of precipitation. The forests in these places are mostly deciduous (which lose their leaves in autumn) and are coniferous in higher elevations. There are also mixed deciduous and coniferous forests in middle elevations.\nIn drier areas, which are usually in the plains, the forests and plants are xerophytic (resistant to drought).\nHowever, in the steppes found in the plains which are semi-arid grasslands and the largest ecosystem of Azerbaijan, where forests and trees cannot grow, plant life is made up of flowers and some shrubs which are resistant to drought."}

This is known as Dodo bird verdict, or Dodo bird conjecture in psychotherapy. Saul Rosenzweig introduced the concept in 1936, and named it after Dodo, a character from Lewis Caroll's book Alice in Wonderland. The topic is controversial. It only became widely known with new research evidence, in the 1970s.\nHistory.\nSaul Rosenzweig introduced the termology in 1936 to illustrate the notion that all therapies are equally effective. Rosenzweig borrowed the phrase from Lewis Carroll's 1865 book, \"Alice in Wonderland\". In the setting, some characters become wet and, in order to dry themselves, the Dodo Bird decided to issue a competition: everyone was to run around the lake until they were dry. Nobody cared to measure how far each person had run, nor how long. When they asked the Dodo who had won, he thought long and hard and then said, \"Everybody has won and all must have prizes.\" In the case of psychotherapies, Rosenzweig argued that common factors were more important than specific technical differences, so that (on the Dodo bird conjecture) all therapies are winners; they all produce equally effective outcomes.\nIn 1974, Lester Lubarsky, Barton Singer and Lise Luborsky published the results of one of the first comparative studies: They showed that there were only few significant differences in the outcome of different psychotherapies. After the study was published, there were many other similar studies: some agreed with the Dodo bird verdict, others didn't.\nIn very basic terms, the Dodo bird debate is focused on the following: Can different components of specific treatmenrs lead to the fact that some of these treatments perfom much better than others, for specific disorders? Those supporing the Dodo bird verdict say that all treatments are equivalent, because they all have \"common factors\". Critics say that the different therapies use different techniques, and these differences are important. For this reason, for a given problem, some therapies produce results that are not equivalent to the others.\nImportance.\nThe outcome of the Dodo bird debate is very important for the future of clinical psychology. For one, policymakers have to know how effective each existing psychotherapy is in order to be able to decide which therapies should be supported. This controversy may also lead government officials to no longer fund psychological treatments and other public health measures."}

(See Mohan Jo Daro, the first form of bullock cart)\nThis is the Sindh that, through the Sumerian nation, brought Babylon and Greece to the brink of arch-building.\nThis is the Sindh whose Mohenjo-daro has found the mark of peace, the traces of the best civilization in the world have been found, and if it has not been found, the name and mark of any weapon so far, which shows that it Civilization may have invaded another region.\nThis is the Sindh that is meeting China and Kabul in the north, then Persia in the west, Gujarat in the east and the sea in the south.\nThere was no Punjab here!\nNo border or Balochistan\nThis is the time when the hungry eyes of the Umayyad Empire stare at it, and go to the extent of plundering it ...\nAnd today! This Sindh is a living proof of the tyranny of Hajjaj bin Yusuf. Where are the imperialist plays trying to take him from?\nIndus Civilization Indus Valley Civilization\nIndus Valley Civilization.\nLet me tell you about the Indus Valley Civilization. The books and writings written by the people or nations who invaded Sindh, especially the Greeks, Iranians and Arabs, have something in common.\nOne is that they are a wise people and we the people of Indus Valley (Indus) are ignorant of these Aryans (non-Aryans). For example, if you read any book written by them, they tried unsuccessfully to prove it. Yes, they are Aryans, the word Aryan is written by the Greeks as it belongs to their language and they are the real Aryans and the people of Indus Valley (Indus) did not know anything. People were Aryans (non-Aryans), and if you read the written history of Persia (Iran), it is also written in the same way that they are Aryans. I didn't know, there was no understanding. It was the people of Sindh (Sindhu) who were Aryas (non-Aryans).\nSecondly, the Greeks, Iranians (Persians) and Arabs have tried hard to somehow change the original name of Sindh (Sindhu). For example, if you read any book written by them, The Persians and Arabs have written Sindh as India, Sindhu as Hindu and the British have changed the name of Sindh (Indus) to India and Indus.\nIn fact (Aryan) and its opposite word (non-Aryan) is Pratakri and Sindhi which means intelligent people of understanding. The people of Sindh (Sindhu) knew that Sindh ( The people of Sindhu have become (Aryans) and the rest of the world did not know that they were human beings and lived in caves so they used the opposite word (non-Aryans) for them and when the invaders Occupied here and when they began to understand the local language, it must have become clear to them that the people of Sindh (Sindhu) consider themselves Aryans, meaning intelligent people, and used the word Aryans (non-Aryans) for these invaders. That is why when these invaders wrote history, we must have started writing these Arya and Arya ourselves in it and claimed the word Arya in their own language.\nWhen the British excavated the ancient great cities of Sindh (Indus) Moin Jo Daro Sindh, Lothal, Alamgirpur Alam Pari India, Harappa Punjab Mandiga (Shortughai), (Mundiga) Shortgai Afghanistan and Luthal India they found out this ancient city They are 5,000 years old and the people living in these cities have a great civilization, especially Moenjodaro, which was Paris at that time and when their DNA was tested, it was found that these races are one and There are real cousins and Moin Jo Daro and other small towns and villages around it may have migrated at some point.\nAfter independence, India discovered and excavated Surkotada in 1964, and when their DNA was tested, it also matched that of the Moin Jo Daro people, hence the name Surkotada. This name is from Gujarati language which means Moin Jo Daro.\nMehrgarh is located 9 km away from Sibi, a city in Balochistan, which is 9000 years old. French and Italian archaeologists Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jarrige and Catherine Jarrige have done research on it from 1974 to 2006, on April 6, 2006 in Paris, France. An international conference of archaeologists was held in which a French archaeologist proved that the people of Mehrgarh were the first people in the world to come out of caves and build their own raw houses. He knew how to weigh cattle, he knew how to raise cattle, he knew how to make jewelry from sea dogs and DNA proved that Moin Jo Daro, Lothal, Sarko Tada, Kali Bangan, Alamgirpur, Harapa. And the people of Shortughai and Mundiga are descendants of him.\nWhich proves that the people of Sindh (Sindhu) are actually Aryans.\nThe fact that Sindh (Sindhu) has been renamed is a fact that these invaders have deliberately tried their best not to leave its name. For example, if you read any book of Arabs and Persians, I have justified the renaming of Sindh (Sindhu) as there is a problem of pronunciation in Persian, therefore Sindh is written as Hind, Sindhu is written as Hindu. In my opinion, there is nothing but lies and I have two very important proofs that there is no problem of pronunciation in Persian which I will address in an important forum.\nThe British changed the name of Sindh (Sindhu) to India, which means beautiful girl. According to them, Sindh (Sindhu) was lush and beautiful, so they named it India in 1700 AD. India was kept.\nFour inspired books have been revealed on this land of Sindh (Indus). Nowhere in the books is the word Hindu written.\nIndus Valley, the world's first game.\nThe world's first dice and chess piece has been discovered in Mohenjo-daro.\nLanguage of Indus Valley.\nLanguage translated from ancient Sindhi and modern Sindhi\nThe first game in the Indus Valley\nThe world's first dice and chess piece has been discovered in Mohenjo-daro.\nIndus Valley Coin.\nThe oldest coin in the Indus Valley was \"Kodi\" and \"Photi Kodi\". Which lasted till the Mughal period.\nSindh Valley bullock cart.\nThe Indus Valley was traded throughout Eurasia by bullock carts and horses.\nAnd the red bull of Sindhi breed and its color is dark red and chocolate. The skin color of this bull is darker than that of a cow. The head and chin are small, wide, and the middle is a little high. The top of the bull is very high. And the navel and the skin are hanging. And it spread to Sindhi Bell, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and many other countries and even today it is known as \"Sindhi Bell\" in South Asia.\nEnglish bullock cart of British era.\nIn 1876, during the British rule, the owner of this state-of-the-art luxury bullock cart service that burned from Sukkur to Shikarpur was an Englishman. Richard Burton, author of several books on Sindh He wrote in his book that it was very comfortable and the fare was 5 paisa. He started his journey at 9 pm and reached his destination at 7 am. The Russians also used it for entertainment.\nSindh Valley Clothing.\nSindhi clothing 6000 hundred years ago\n18th century clothing.\nSindhi war armor, swords and equipment of the 18th century.\nSindhi Topi Ajrak.\nSindh is the southern province of Pakistan. An area of its own kind of civilization, traditions, and millennial heritage, this is where the magical Indus Valley falls into the sea, which gave the whole region its name - India. \nSome of the earliest civilizations of the East were born and developed on this earth,\nIt has a round or cylindrical shape, it has a characteristic neck, which is made with front beads or mirrors. Very often it was given to distinguished guests and dear friends as a token of respect.\nSindhi hats can have two different options - hard and soft. Difficult people keep their shape good and don't lose it even after washing. Gentle people are easier said than done - they're easier to carry around in a regular pocket.\nThe embroidery on the cape is very interesting. Generally speaking, it is handmade; In addition to multi-threads, it also includes the use of beads and small round mirrors. The hat is usually round but has a neck in the form of a minbar or mahram on the forehead (rarely in the form of a mosque) This element appeared later when the people of Sindh converted to Islam so that the forehead of the worshiper Could touch\nSindhi Tapi can now be found all over Pakistan. In Punjab, Balochistan, North West Province ... Neighboring Afghanistan, India and Iran are also popular.\nHistory of Sindh, as well as most of the Pakistani regions, migration of tribes, mix of movements and cultures, raids with conquerors, Alexander the Great, Persian and Mongols to English. However, many space creatures preferred the land of Sindh to their homeland and remained here forever, adding something to their local complex culture.\nA long time ago, a man without a headcoat was not initially welcomed in Sindhi culture as an option to cover his head. The first prototype was probably a cotton cup on his head with a bean in the middle. Which gave it the shape of a quadruple. And based on that, many hat options have already been developed that have changed over time.\nOne of the current five styles (cape, circular, quadruple, conceptual and a beetle leaf shape) is slowly advancing -\nIn pre-Islamic times and then for non-Muslims it was customary to decorate the hat with silk, gold and silver threads. Such hats were often worn under the turban, except for the upper part. Then the good line like the pulpit has not been accepted yet but the good line of the crescent appeared. Currently, this option is considered outdated, and you can only define it in museums.\nLater, pieces of enamel, pearls and jewels are found on the hat.\nEmbroidery begins to install traditional patterns: squares, rectangles, circles and ovals, stars, sun and moon. Mirror pieces of different shapes seem to dominate the jewelry. They reflect the Cape with a bright, festive look\nYoung people think of old age as a tribute to traditional headwear, meaning they can sometimes be worn for a national holiday or religious occasion.\nThat is why the National Province of Sindh Culture Day was instituted in 2009 to preserve the consciousness of religion and national consciousness, the central symbol of the Sindhi hat and adjark (a unique national cap which was printed in block form). This day is held annually in early December.\nOn the occasion of the holiday, he says that at present the youth do not understand the value of their culture and consider Sindhi hats and turbans as unnecessary and forget that once their forefathers were proud of them and considered them as a sign of honor.\nToday, most men wear the national white shalwar kameez with a reliable Sindhi hat of various colors on their heads, while most of them cover Ajrak's shoulders. In their traditional suits, womenplace the dupatta (dupatta) with ajrak (the color and color and shape are slightly different from that of the men). Local folk art products in national bazaar parks are hosting large-scale festival sales.\nOrganizers say that this day in Sindh province does not belong to any political party and does not serve any government purpose. \u2032 \u2032 In our framework, we want to show the world our national culture, its diversity and richness of internal content. Today we celebrate the importance of our cultural heritage, which is very precious in Sindh! \"\nThis day is not only celebrated in Pakistan but also many representatives of this country abroad sometimes want to remember their roots, their culture.\nSindhi hat is not just a decorated hat and a mirror, it is now a symbol of Pakistan's national culture. \nMehrgarh.\nMehrgarh is an important site of modern stone in archeology which is located in present day Balochistan, Pakistan. According to known history, this is the first region in South Asia where wheat and barley were first cultivated and animal husbandry was known. \nNine thousand years ago, due to population growth and declining hunting, a local tribe settled permanently in Mehrgarh on the banks of the Bolan River. Gradually, he began to cultivate grain and raise livestock in order to put out the fire in his stomach. Thus the tribe became one of the first human groups to start farming and raising animals on the planet. This revolutionary process in the history of mankind became known in the science of effects as the \"Neolithic Revolution\". Mehrgarh was the birthplace and center of this international revolution, at least in Asia. Initially, the settlement was spread over a few acres. Gradually other nomadic tribes also settled there, so the area of the settlement began to expand. According to archaeologists, between 7,000 and 10,000 people lived in Mehrgarh 7,000 years ago. This is a very large number in terms of the time because at that time the human population in the entire subcontinent was only 200,000. That is why Mehrgarh is one of the first cities in the world. Other older cities include Qatlihouk (Turkey), Ain Ghazal (Jordan) and Orak (Iraq). \nCurrent effects of Mehr Garg.\nYou may have read earlier that the present \"Mehr Nation\" was settled in Mehr Garh. And the population in the subcontinent at that time\nIt was two lakh. And this population grew. And the Indus today is called Mehran and the Indian state of Maharashtra is one of them. Seal\nMaking the Indus Valley a continent.\nThe Indus Valley is called by many names. As the Indian subcontinent, the small continent, the Indus continent or the Sindh continent and the Iqbal Declaration have repeatedly called it the subcontinent.\nQuaid-e-Azam.\nQuaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah said: South Asia, Indus India is not a country but a continent. And it is not possible for Muslims and Hindus to live together on one continent.\nChristopher Columbus.\nColumbus was born in 1450 in the famous Italian city of Geneva. Columbus wanted that\nGo on a long voyage. And travel to other parts of the world. When Columbus did not have such an opportunity in Italy, he moved to Portugal. He wanted the Indus to mean the present day Pakistan and India and the Far East\nFind new sea lanes. But the king of Portugal refused to help him. That's why new routes were being sought. Which trades between Europe and Asia The tremors were by sea. But in the 15th century, the Strait of Hormuz and its environs were annexed by Turkey. And trading by sea was no longer safe for the Pope.\nDisappointed with the King of Portugal, Columbus now moved to Spain. Where he persuaded Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to expedite and help find new routes. On August 13, 1492, Columbus embarked on a long voyage on three ships. The ship Columbus was aboard. Her name was Santa Maria. The initial journey was very difficult. But Columbus's ship cascaded in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. And with bad weather, he had to deal with rebellious waves. \nColumbus finally landed on an island with his ship. He saw many small islands around him.

This transition put Woerde in a position where he could leave the advertising company and focus solely on LetsHeal.\nIn 2011, Mark Woerde published the book \u201cHow Advertising Will Heal The World And Your\u201d which lays the foundations for a radical paradigm shift in branding and advertising.\nSocial activities.\nWoerde was the driving force behind the success of Neighbor Day (Burendag), an early prosocial activity to stimulate social cohesion. It was developed by Woerde and his partners at advertising agency Lemz; Peter de Lange and Remco Marinus for coffee brand Douwe Egberts. Neighbor Day was started in 2006 and has evolved into an annual tradition in the Netherlands. Neighbor Day inspires people to look after their neighbors, spending time together and making their neighborhood even more beautiful. After three years, Woerde managed Neighbor Day to earn the participation of the and the Oranje Fonds.\nIn 2013, the Dutch branch of , noting that efforts to combat child sex tourism in impoverished countries had resulted in pedophiles instead seeking victims online, joined forces with Mark Woerde and his team at advertising agency Lemz that at first preferred to remain anonymous to create the animated, photorealistic image of a 10-year-old Filipina girl named . The Sweetie operation took almost 2 years of preparation. In a period of 10 weeks more than 20,000 predators interacted with Woerde's team. Eventually over 1,000 predators from 71 countries were identified and handed over to Interpol. Most of the identified predators could be identified via bits of information revealed by the team using a fake identity as a 10 year old Filipino kid. Sweetie as an avatar/virtual girl proved to be especially useful in a smaller but difficult to track down number of predators. The information was given to the local police or Interpol. Over one billion people have seen the operation in the evening news.\nAfter receiving a letter of recognition from the United Nations, Woerde and his team admitted to the creative industry that they were behind this initiative. Woerde decided to give one public interview to the popular TV show \u2019s to explain the intervention and to make clear that he was no longer involved in , or police activities.\nIn 2017 Mark Woerde and his team from Lemz and LetsHeal developed together with the groundbreaking, record-breaking and award-winning media project \u201cMake Friends Across Religions\u201d that brought to the man on the street a friendship call by the world\u2019s most prominent faith leaders, such as Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama."}

She recorded just over thirty pop and jazz albums between 1955 and 1969. Her recording of the Arthur Hamilton melancholy pop ballad \"Cry Me a River\" was added into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001. London was also awarded a Golden Globe Award in 1974 for her role as Dixie McCall in the 1970s NBC television show \"Emergency!\" (1972 to 1977).\nLondon was the female lead in a lot of Western movies. Those included acting with Gary Cooper in \"Man of the West\" (1958), Robert Taylor in \"Saddle the Wind\" (another 1958 Western movie) and Robert Mitchum for \"The Wonderful Country\" (1959). Other movies were the crime movie \"Crimes Against Joe\" (1956) and the musical and comedy movie \"The Girl Can't Help It\" (also from 1956). \nLondon released several albums during the 1960s. Those included \"Whatever Julie Wants\" (1961), \"Love Letters\" (1962) and \"The End of the World\" (1963).

{"id": "863586", "revid": "138847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=863586", "title": "Music censorship", "text": "Music censorship refers to editing, censoring or changing different forms/areas of music for a particular reason. The reasons for censoring or editing a song often include moral, religious or political subjects or themes involving the song in question. Censorship often varies from the complete government-enforced legal prohibitions for musical works to the optional removal of questionable or inappropriate material when a song or other musical work appears in a particular context.\nDecency.\nSongs are often edited before they're broadcast on any radio or television networks. This is for removing any material that may be classified as objectionable for a number of listeners. The objectionable materials in question include profanity, references to sex, violence and drug abuse/trafficking. This is mainly done to comply with the relevant rule in broadcasting and with the conduct codes. It's also done for making songs more marketable for mainstream audiences. Songs edited for materials within this manner are mainly called clean version songs. Common editing techniques include backmasking, blocking or completely replacing any offensive lyrics with different words.\nExamples of songs with questionable or offensive words.\nSeveral different edits of the CeeLo Green pop/soul song \"Fuck You\". These include one where the song's lyrics and title were changed to \"Forget You.\" Another mutes the profanity \"fuck\" without actually replacing it. The original title for The Black Eyed Peas' 2003 song \"Let's Get it Started\" was \"Let's Get Retarded\". The song's title was changed because the word \"retarded\" was an offensive word. \"Let's Get it Started\" was later released as a standalone single. It peaked at #21 on the United States' \"Billboard Hot 100\".\nSongs having possibly objectionable wordings with double meanings or mishearings of certain phrases were also sometimes censored. One example for such songs includes Britney Spears' 2009 dance-pop single \"If U Seek Amy\". The chorus and title for this Spears' song were heard in the words \"F-U-C-K me\". Spears' then record labels made a radio edit of the song in which the word \"seek\" was replaced by \"see\". That was because \"If U Seek Amy\" was criticized for being a sexually offensive song. The song caused serious controversy related to possible obscenity all across the world. Similar concerns and troubles happened with The Black Eyed Peas' 2005 single \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\". Radio stations were especially worried the word \"phunk\" (the misspelling of the word \"funk\") could be misheard by listeners as sounding almost like the word \"fuck\". The group's record label created an alternate version changing the word to \"mess\".\nCriticism.\nSome listeners have not been satisfied with musical works being edited for being played over radio. They say that it damages the artistic integrity of the original song. Listeners have to seek out other platforms which are not being censored. One example of such platforms is listening to music through the Internet. The gangsta rap group N.W.A was highly controversial, in particular for the song \"Fuck tha Police\", released in 1988. The assistant directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent letters to Priority Records to protest against the lyrics of the song. In 1992, another song about violence towards law enforcement agents, \"Cop Killer\", was released by Body Count and rap singer Ice-T. \nThe civil rights activist C. Delores Tucker criticized gangsta rap. She was intensely criticized during several songs over her having negative opinions toward gangsta rap. One especially criticizing song was the 1996 Tupac Shakur song \"How Do U Want It\". Tucker sued Shakur's estate for emotional distress and slander related to the song. The lawsuit, however, was later dismissed.\nIn 1990, Floridian political activist Jack Thompson targeted Miami-based rap singers 2 Live Crew and their 1989 album \"As Nasty as They Wanna Be\". Songs on the album included \"Me So Horny\" (taken from the 1987 war movie \"Full Metal Jacket\"). Thompson classified the rap album as obscene."}

It looked like a motorcycle. It was a steam engine on a bicycle. Louis-Guillaume Perreaux made the steam engine, and Pierre Michaux made the bicycle. It was made in France between 1867 and 1871. It is one of three moving machines that people say could be the first motorcycle. The two others are the Roper steam velocipede of 1867 or 1868 and the internal combustion engine Daimler Reitwagen of 1885. Perreaux made the steam velocipede better over time. He had built a tricycle version by 1884. The only Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede made, on loan from the Mus\u00e9e de l'\u00cele-de-France, Sceaux, was the first machine viewers saw when they went into the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum rotunda in the Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in New York in 1998.\nFirst motorcycle?\nNot everyone agrees on which machine was the first motorcycle. Wtiter L. J. K. Setright said the simplest way to say what a motorcycle was was a bicycle with a heat engine. \"If we accept this we must go on to admit that its prototype is unidentifiable, shrouded in the mists of industrial antiquity,\" meaning that this definition meant no one could say for sure which motorcycle was first. Both the Michaux-Perreaux and Roper machines have also been said to be produced in the years 1867, 1868, and 1869.\nOther people, such as \"Cycle World\"'s Technical Editor Kevin Cameron, say neither of these two machines were the first motorcycles. They either say that a true motorcycle must use a gasoline internal combustion engine, or that the first motorcycle must use the same technology as motorcycles that were good enough for people to make many of them. They say that \"dead end\" motorcycles do not count. These people say that Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler's 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was the first motorcycle.\nThe first motorcycle that was mass-produced is easier to find. It was the liquid cooled four-stroke Hildebrand &amp;amp; Wolfm\u00fcller of 1894. It was mass-produced, and sold commecially. \nDefinition of first motorcycle.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and other dictionaries say that motorcycles must have an internal combustion engine. By this definition, the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede is not a motorcycle. For most of the 20th century, people thought this definition of \"motorcycle\" was good. But then electric motorcycles became more important.\nSome people say the Reitwagen was the first motorcycle because its power generator is like the power generators in almost all later motorcycles that worked well. Cameron said, \"History follows things that succeed, not things that fail.\" Writer Glynn Ker ignored the Michaux-Perraux altogether. Ker says the Daimler Reitwagen is, \"the predecessor of all gasoline-driven vehicles on land, sea, or air.\" He does not call it a true motorcycle, though, because it had to use two wheels that stuck out from the sides to keep from falling over, so it could not lean to the side the way modern motorcycles do. Kerr also says that that the Reitwagen was not as well designed as other vehicles Daimler and Maybach made. Daimler and Maybach were not interested in motorcycles at the time. They wanted to use the Motorwagen to test their engine. After they had developed it, they worked on building a four wheeled stagecoach, a hot air balloon, and a boat instead. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed \"a crude makeshift.\" He said, \"as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date.\"\nDevelopment.\nL. J. K. Setright and David Burgess-Wise say that it was Pierre Michaux's son Ernest who first attached the engine to the velocipede. Charles M. Falco says it was Louis-Guillaume Perreaux. The Michaux-Perreaux machine was made out of one of the first pedal bicycles that sold well, a boneshaker. Michaux had been building over 400 of these bicycles per year since 1863. The velocipede also used a single cylinder alcohol fueled Perreaux engine, which used twin flexible leather belt drives to the rear wheel. They put a steam pressure gauge where the rider could see it, above the front wheel. They added a hand control so the rider could control the steam. The base Michaux velocipede came with a spoon brake, but the steam version had no brakes. The engine weighed , and the whole steam velocipede weighed . In a June 14, 1871 version, Perreaux removed some cranks and pedals from the front wheel. There was an arched downtube instead of straight one to give the engine more space. The steam velocipede worked. It did not have any commercial successors.\nOnly one of the original 1867\u20131871 machine was ever made, but by 1884, Perreaux showed a tricycle version of his steam velocipede at the Industrial Exhibition on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Paris. It had two rear wheels, and the belt drove the front wheel. The alcohol-fueled engine had a bore and stroke like the original's, and developed a steam pressure of 3\u00bd atm (250 kPa) in its boiler. It could move as fast as . The water tanks had enough fuel for two to three hours of steam, so it could go ."}

{"id": "863740", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=863740", "title": "Blue space", "text": "In urban planning and design, blue space or blue infrastructure refers to all the areas which have bodies of water or water courses (that is lakes, rivers, and bays). Together with greenspace (parks, gardens and the like), it allows to lower the temperature in the city (called urban heat island).\nMany cities have waterbodies. Very often, these waterbodies have been important in the history of the city. One such example is the River Thames in London.\nAccessible blue spaces can help revitalize neighborhoods. It can also promote the people feeling like they belong together. Examples of such project are the Chattanooga Waterfront (Chattanooga, Tennessee), the CityDeck in Green Bay, Wisconsin, or the Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City. Festivals at the waterfront also help promote this feeling.\nNeighborhoods with access to attractive natural features often have the problem of gentrification, people with more money, a better education or a higher social class will move in, and lead to a price increase. For this reason, the social benefits associated with waterbodies are often not distributed equally. Normal neighborhoods and poorer ones often do not have access to good quality blue spaces.\nHealth benefits of blue spaces.\nLiving close to water bodies carriessome risks, such as water-borne diseases in drinking water, flooding risks, or drowning. Scientific evidence shows that exposure to blue spaces is also associated with different health benefits to those near water bodies. One of the mechanisms by which this phenomenon can be explained is by the Biophilia hypothesis developed by Edward O. Wilson. This theory states that humans have developed a strong connection with nature throughout their evolution: This leads them to subconsciously seek natural environments, including green and blue spaces.Recent research has identified three main way that can help explain why living close to green and blue spaces can be beneficial to health.\nEffects of blue spaces on physical health.\nIncreased physical activity.\nDifferent studies have found that people who live near coastal areas are more likely to practice a form of physical activity that is healthy. This has been explained by the fact that there are walking paths along the coast, that can be used. Another explanation is that blue spaces have aestethical attributes (they 'look good') which may motivate people to practice a physical activity near or on the water. Having a body of water close by is not enough to motivate people to be physically active: These bodies of water need to be accessible. A study that focused on teenagers found that those living near beaches that had a major road between their homes and the water body had lower levels of physical activity than those with a direct access to the beach.\nReduced obesity.\nAs outlined above, the presence of blue spaces may lead to people being physically more active. A study found that people who lived far from green spaces or a waterfront in an urban area have a higher risk of developing obesity.\nBetter breathing.\nPeople who have conditions that affect breathing (such as asthma) can improve their quality of life when they move closer to a body of water. This could be explained by the mists and sprays generated by the water movement. Another study that measured the impact in health of green and blue spaces for those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had similar findings.\nEffects of blue spaces on mental health.\nBetter overall mental health.\nResearchers found a reduction of psychiatric cases on people living near green or coastal areas. Some of the studies found that ocean exposure or running along river helped war veterans suffering from PTSD. Others found that practising water-related activities such as surfing can help coping with mental health issues and help develop self-confidence and self-reliance skills.\nBetter mood and happiness.\nExposure to blue spaces is also linked to increased happiness. A group of researchers studying the effect of green and blue spaces on happiness used a mobile app to track feelings of people when they were near water landscapes. The researchers found that people were happier near water bodies. Consistently with the findings focusing on physical health, the positive effects on mood associated to blue spaces seem to diminish as the distance between the residence and the water increases.\nImproved recovery from drug and alcohol addiction.\nIt was shown that pratising a common activity in blue spaces, for example sailing, had a positive effect on people doing drug and alcohol rehabilitation.\nBlue spaces quality assessment tools.\nA group of researches has developed a set of tools, to be able to measure the quality and potential health benefits of these blue spaces. The BlueHealth Environmental Assessment Tool (BEAT) - enables comparable assessment of environmental aspects and attributes that influence access to, use of and health-promoting activities in blue spaces.

Very often it was the oldest man in the familiy. His family consisted of his wife, his children, his slaves, and other relatives. Hi duty was to represent the family to the outsie, towards the state, but also towards the gods. If his sons married, their wives and children were also subject to the pater familias. He had supreme power, called patria potestas. This also meant that he was a judge in family matters. As such, he has the right to decide over life and death of the family members (called i\"us vitae necisque\" \"-\" the right [to decide] over life and death\")\"\nWhen the Pater famliias died, his children would become free from his power.

{"id": "863756", "revid": "850667", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=863756", "title": "Twelve Tables", "text": "The Law of the Twelve tables ( or \"Duodecimo Tabulae\") was the legislation that stood at the foundation of Roman law. Formally promulgated in 449 BC, the Tables were mostly a summary earlier traditions written down as a set of laws.\nDisplayed in the Forum, \"The Twelve Tables\" stated the rights and duties of the Roman citizen. Their formulation was the result of considerable agitation by the plebeian class, who had until then been excluded from the higher benefits of the Republic. Before that, the law had not been written down. Higher-class priests, the pontifices, intepreted it. Cicero (106\u201343 BC) stated that the \"Twelve Tables...seems to me, assuredly to [be better than] the libraries of all the philosophers, both in weight of authority, and in [usefulness]\". Cicero hardly exaggerated; the Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law for a thousand years.\nThe Twelve Tables are rather comprehensive, they have been described as a 'code'. Modern scholars consider this characterization exaggerated. The Tables were a sequence of definitions of various private rights and procedures. They generally took for granted such things as the institutions of the family and various rituals for formal transactions. The provisions were often highly specific and diverse.\nInfluence and significance.\nThe Twelve Tables are often cited as the foundation for ancient Roman law. The Twelve Tables provided an early understanding of some key concepts such as justice, equality, and punishment. Although legal reform occurred soon after the implementation of the Twelve Tables, these ancient laws provided social protection and civil rights for both the patricians and plebeians. At this time, there was extreme tension between the privileged class and the common people. This meant that some form of social order was needed. While the existing laws had major flaws that were in need of reform, the Twelve Tables eased the civil tension and violence between the plebeians and patricians.\nThe Twelve Tables also heavily influenced and are referenced in later Roman Laws texts, especially The Digest of Justinian I. Such laws from The Digest that are derived from the Twelve Tables are the legal recompense for damage caused by an animal, protocol for inheritances, and also laws about structural property damage.\nThe influence of the Twelve Tables can still be seen today. The Twelve Tables play a significant role in the basis of the early American legal system. Political theorists, such as James Madison have highlighted the importance of the Twelve Tables in crafting the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of property was also perpetuated in the Twelve Tables, including the different forms of money, land, and slaves. Another example: the Twelve Tables are tied into the notion of Jus Commune, which translates as \"common law\", but is commonly referred to as \"civil law\" in English-speaking countries. Some countries including South Africa and San Marino still base their current legal system on aspects of jus commune. In addition, law school students throughout the world are still required to study the Twelve Tables as well as other facets of Roman Law in order to better understand the current legal system in place.\nThe Twelve Tables no longer exist: although they remained an important source through the Republic, they became obsolete, and were only of historical interest. The original tablets may have been destroyed when the Gauls under Brennus burned Rome in 387 BC. Cicero claimed that he learned them by heart as a boy in school, but that no one did so any longer. What we have of them today are brief excerpts and quotations from these laws in other authors, often in clearly updated language. They are written in an archaic, laconic Latin (described as Saturnian verse). As such, though it cannot be determined whether the quoted fragments accurately preserve the original form, what is present gives some insight into the grammar of early Latin. Some claim that the text was written as such so plebeians could more easily memorize the laws, as literacy was not common during early Rome. Roman Republican scholars wrote commentaries upon the Twelve Tables, such as L. Aelius Stilo, teacher of both Varro and Cicero.\nLike most other early codes of law, they were about the procedure: They specified in detail, how something needed to be done. They also gave the same detail, about what the punishment was if the procedure wasn't followed. In most of the surviving quotations from these texts, the original table that held them is not given. Scholars have guessed at where surviving fragments belong by comparing them with the few known attributions and records, many of which do not include the original lines, but paraphrases. It cannot be known with any certainty from what survives that the originals ever were organized this way, or even if they ever were organized by subject at all."}

U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to remove troops from Afghanistan, followed by his replacement Joe Biden continuing to do so, made it easier for the Taliban to take power. \nIn the days before and after Kabul's fall, thousands of civilians left the country and thousands of others have failed in their attempts to do so. Many Afghan women are scared because they don't know how the Taliban will treat women in Afghanistan.\nOn 30 August 2021, evacuations from Afghanistan ended, allowing Taliban to take full control of the country and ending the War in Afghanistan."}

It made advertisements and public service announcements to get people to stop throwing garbage on the ground outside. Its most famous public service announcement is the Crying Indian public service announcement and for starting the word \"litterbug.\" Most of the groups that started Keep America Beautiful are for-profit companies that make bottles, cans, and other packaging. They wanted people to think pollution came from people littering and not from companies making too much packaging. This is called greenwashing.\nBeginning.\nAfter World War II, many companies decided to sell their products in packages that could not be used again. They did this because it was cheaper than using bottles and cans again. Many of these companies did not want the government to make laws telling them what to do. For example, in 1953, the state of Vermont passed a law against one-use bottles because farmers said people were throwing the empty bottles into haystacks and that cows were eating them. This type of law was called a \"bottle bill.\"\nIn 1951, the American Can Company and Owens-Illinois Glass Company and other companies started Keep America Beautiful. Other groups joined too:\nOwens-Illinois would later own the Dixie Cup Company.\nIdeas.\nThe companies behind Keep America Beautiful did not want the government to pass laws that would cost them money. For example, they wanted to stop laws that would make them sell drinks in reusable bottles. Throwaway bottles were cheaper. Keep American Beautiful wanted voters to look at the ad and think people made pollution one by one and not that big companies made pollution.\nThe Ad Council started by thinking of litter as something ugly and poor citizenship. They said that people who littered were thoughtless and careless and made the world ugly for other people. The Keep America Beautiful media fact sheet read that littering ruined \"pleasure and recreation from their beautiful outdoors. [...] Yet their enjoyment of the natural and man-made attractions of our grand landscape is everywhere marred by the litter which careless people leave in their wake. [...] The mountain of refuse keeps growing.\" They also said that litter cost money to clean up and could be bad for health.\nPolitics.\nKeep America Beautiful supported some laws but not others.\nKeep America Beautiful did support laws telling people what to do:\nKeep America Beautiful did not support laws telling companies what to do:\nAds.\nThe Advertising Council helped make ads for Keep America Beautiful. The Advertising Council had already made Smokey Bear for the U.S. Forest Service. Smokey the Bear tells people \"Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires.\" The Council decided their ad for Keep America Beautiful should be like the Smokey Bear ads: It should tell people that their own choices solve problems.\nSusan Spotless.\nBefore the Crying Indian ad, Keep America Beautiful used a character called \"Susan Spotless.\" This was a young white girl in a white dress who shook her finger at adults who littered and told them to stop: \"Daddy, you forgot . . . every litter bit hurts!\" (\"Litter\" sounds like \"little\" in American English.) The idea was that parents should be ashamed to teach their children to litter.\nCrying Indian ad.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the idea that the environment must be protected became strong in America. Many of the protesters just before the first Earth Day talked about throwaway containers. For example, students from the University of Michigan put a big pile of empty drink containers on the ground outside the offices of the National Soft Drink Association.\nThe hippies of the 1960s liked the idea of Native Americans. In 1967, \"Life\" wrote that hippies saw \"the dispossessed Indian as America\u2019s original dropout, and convinced that he has deeper spiritual values than the rest of society, hippies have taken to wearing his costume and horning in on his customs,\" meaning that hippies wanted to copy American Indians.\nIn the Crying Indian ad, an actor dressed as a Native American, paddles a canoe through a stream. At first, the stream is clean and pretty but it becomes dirtier and full of garbage. He gets out of the stream and walks to a highway, where people throw garbage out of their cars. Then he slowly cries one tear. A voice says, \"Some people have a deep, abiding respect for the natural beauty that was once this country. And some people don't. ... People start pollution. People can stop it.\" The ad was on television starting in 1971. It was about littering. The ad won many awards, for example two Clio Awards. Television stations played it so much that their copies of the film wore out and they had to get new ones.\nTrent University history professor Finis Dunaway says that the man in the Crying Indian ad \"appears completely powerless. In the commercial, all he can do is lament the land his people lost,\" when, at the same time, real-life American Indians were working to solve their problems.\nAnother Crying Indian ad was on television in 1975. In 1998, the first one was on television again.\nActor.\nIron Eyes Cody was an actor who played Native Americans on television and in movies. He had already been in many movies and TV shows before the Crying Indian ad. Iron Eyes Cody said he was a Native American, but he was really Italian American.\nEnvironmental groups.\nFor a while, environmental groups, for example the National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, worked with Keep America Beautiful. These two groups stopped agreeing in the 1970s when they wanted to pass more bottle bills and Keep America Beautiful did not. One of Keep America Beautiful's leaders called the environmental groups \"communists\" for wanting to pass these laws.\nOther work.\nKeep America Beautiful started the National Center for Resource Recovery in the 1970s. The NCRR is a lobbying group: It sends people to talk to lawmakers and convince them to pass or not pass laws."}

The company began its business operations in Los Angeles, California in 1926. Orange Julius is known for a popular drink named after the restaurant. The beverage is blended ice, powdered egg whites, milk, orange juice and vanilla flavoring.\nHistory.\nThe drink grew from an orange juice stand that was opened in 1926 by Julius Freed. Original sales were only about $20 each day (that equals almost $290 in 2020 United States dollars). Three years later, Bill Hamlin, Freed's real estate broker, developed a blend that made the acidic orange juice not bother his stomach as much. Freed's stand began giving out the drink. It had a more bubbly and smoother texture. The sales at the stand went up when the new drink was introduced. The sales increased to just over $100 per day.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Orange Julius was always sold from a variety of outlets. They included county and state fairs along with standalone Orange Julius stands. \nThe Orange Julius chain was bought out by the International Dairy Queen Corporation in 1987. IDQ, a subsidiary for Berkshire Hathaway, has the rights to all Orange Julius stores. It has expanded the chain so its drinks are offered and sold from most of its Dairy Queen stores.\nNaming and mascot.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Orange Julius beverage stands used the images of a devil having a pitchfork around an orange. Their slogan was \"A Devilish Good Drink\". The devil images looked almost like Sparky (the Sun Devil). The actual Sparky was the mascot used by Arizona State University.

Young girls are often raped, because they are thought to be virgins because of their age. Sometimes, people with disabilities are raped, because the rapist thinks that because of their disability, these people do not have sex and are therefore virgins.\nHistory.\nThe myth was first reported in 16th-century Europe; it became widely known in 19th-century Victorian England as a cure for syphilis and gonorrhea among other sexually transmitted diseases. The origin is unknown, but historian Hanne Blank writes that the idea may have evolved from Christian legends of virgin\u2013martyrs, whose purity served as a form of protection in battling demons.\nPrevalence.\nPeople all over the world have heard this myth, including in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.\nA survey by the University of South Africa (UNISA) in South Africa found that 18 percent of workers thought that having sex with a virgin cures HIV/AIDS. An earlier study in 1999 by sexual health educators in Gauteng reported that 32 percent of the people taking part in the survey believed the myth.\nAccording to Betty Makoni of the Girl Child Network in Zimbabwe, traditional healers carry on the myth, because they tell HIV-positive men that having sex with a virgin can cure HIV/AIDS. In Zimbabwe, some people also believe that the blood produced by raping a virgin will cleanse the infected person's blood of the disease.\nIn 2002, psychologist Mike Earl-Taylor wrote that the virgin cure myth may explain the rise in child or infant rapes in South Africa, which is facing an HIV/AIDS epidemic. UNICEF has attributed the rape of hundreds of girls to the virgin cleansing myth.\nThere have been no studies to find out how common the myth is, and how many people get raped because of this belief. Researchers Rachel Jewkes and Helen Epstein say that the belief does not drive HIV infection or child sexual abuse in Africa. A study done on convicted sex offenders in Malawi also did not find any evidence to support the idea that the virgin cleansing myth prompted any rapes.\nImportance of education.\nBecause peolple do not know about HIV and the AIDS infection, this causes problems with preventing it in many countries in Africa.\nEducation has helped women such as Betty Makoni speak out against the myth and attempt to dissuade people from believing the virgin cleansing myth."}

The motion picture was directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. The movie is a loose adaptation of \"The 120 Days of Sodom\" (a 1785 book first published in 1904). The book was first published by Marquis de Sade. The movie happens during World War II. It was Pasolini's final movie. The movie was released almost three weeks after Pasolini's murder.\nThe movie deals with rich, corrupt Italian serial seducers at the time of the fascist Republic of Sal\u00f2 (1943\u201345). The seducers kidnap eighteen youths. The youths are exposed to almost four months of sadistic behavior, intense violence and sexual torturte. The movie is associated with certain themes. They include morality, nihilism, capitalism, sexual material and fascism. The movie has four segments, which were inspired from the narriative poem \"The Divine Comedy\" by Dante Alighieri (the Italian poet): the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Excrement, and the Circle of Blood. The movie also has constant references towards and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche's 1887 novel \"On the Genealogy of Morality\", Ezra Pound's poem \"The Cantos\" and Marcel Proust's novel sequence \"In Search of Lost Time\".\nThe movie first began showing at the Paris Film Festival on 23 November 1975. It was briefly shown in movie theaters across Italy. Just after New Year's Day 1976, however, this motion picture was officially banned in that country. It was later released on 3 October 1977 in the United States. Because of the movie depicting teens becoming victims of graphic violence, sexual abuse and murder, it was controversial when released. It remains banned in several countries.\nCensorship.\n\"Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom\" was rejected by the British Board of Film Classification (the name then was the British Board of Film Censors) in early January 1976. The reason behind the rejection was later cited as \"gross indecency\" (anything which offended against the recognised standards of propriety).\nIn Australia, \"Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom\" was banned all across the country for indecency reasons. Following a seventeen-years-long ban, rating officials at the Australian Classification Board re-rated the movie R18+ (meaning 18 and older) uncut for its theatrical release in mid July 1993. In July 2008, however, the Australian Classification Review Board members rated the movie Refused Classification for the third time. In 2010, it was released having an R18+ rating. The Classification Board officials said the DVD of the movie was passed due to \"the inclusion of 176 minutes of additional material which provided a context to the feature film.\"\nThe movie was originally banned in 1976 in New Zealand for almost twenty-one years. \nReception.\nThe Rotten Tomatoes rated the movie near 71% with thirty-eight reviews. The site's reviews read: \"Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom will strike some viewers as irredeemably depraved, but its unflinching view of human cruelty makes it impossible to ignore.\" \nDirector Michael Haneke called \"Sal\u00f2\" as his fourth-favorite motion picture while voting for a 2002 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" magazine poll. Director Catherine Breillat said the movie wasn't really meant to be shocking.\nDirector John Waters said, \"\"Salo\" is a beautiful film...it uses obscenity in an intelligent way...and it's about the pornography of power.\"\nIn 2011, Roger Ebert wrote that he owned the movie since its release on LaserDisc. Ebert, however, had not watched it. The reason Ebert didn't watch the movie was due to its transgressive reputation."}

Cranberry juice sold in stores usually has sugar and water added. Some has other fruit juices.\nThe terms \"cranberry juice cocktail\" and \"cranberry juice blend\" mean products have between 25% and 49% cranberry juice. The rest comes from different fruit juice concentrate (usually peach, grape or raspberry), also having added sugar to improve taste. Low-calorie cranberry juice products contain artificial sweeteners. Cranberry juice is tart due to its mixed content of polyphenols. Those include flavonoids, phenolic acids and anthocyanins. \nAlthough many people believe that cranberry juice helps prevent urinary tract infections, it has no such proven effect. This was determined by the Cochrane review during completed clinical research. The scientific panel of the European Food Safety Authority said a cause-and-effect relationship could not be established between cranberry juice and urinary tract infections.\nConsuming cranberry juice and nutrition.\nCranberry juice is 86% water, 26% carbohydrates, and less than 1% fat or protein. A cup of regular (fortified) cranberry juice (248 grams or 8 ounces) has 107 calories. It has vitamin C as an ingredient to preserve freshness. Other micronutrients may be added during manufacturing. Other than vitamin C and folate having more than 10% of the Daily Value, a typical serving of cranberry juice has no micronutrients in significant content.\nOne half cup of cranberry juice has 60 calories, 20% of the Daily Value for vitamin C. That counts as one-half of a fruit serving toward the United States MyPlate daily nutrition guide.\nEffect on health.\nCranberry juice is an acidic drink with a pH of about 2.6. Some cranberry juice products have large amounts of sugar used in manufacturing. This makes the drink taste better. Drinking cranberry juice may increase the risk of hyperglycemia and reduced control of blood glucose in people with diabetes or glucose intolerance."}

Her first husband was a part of the Merkit clan. Some people say that his name was Qudu (d. 1217), son of Toqto'a Beki of the Merkits. However, Rashid-al-Din Hamadani called her first husband as Dayir Usun of the Merkits. When Genghis conquered the Merkits in 1204, he gave T\u00f6regene to \u00d6gedei as his second wife. While \u00d6gedei's first wife Boraqchin had no sons, T\u00f6regene gave birth to five sons, G\u00fcy\u00fck, K\u00f6t\u00e4n, K\u00f6ch\u00fc, Qarachar, and Qashi (father of Kaidu).\nShe became more important than all of \u00d6gedei's wives and slowly became a more powerful person in court. But T\u00f6regene still did not like \u00d6gedei's officials and the rules of the government being managed more by the ruler and lowering tax. T\u00f6regene paid for the reprinting of the Taoist canon in North China. Through the power of T\u00f6regene, \u00d6gedei made Abd-ur-Rahman a tax farmer in China.\nGreat Khatun of the Mongol Empire.\nAfter \u00d6gedei died in 1241, power first passed to M\u00f6ge Khatun, one of \u00d6gedei's widows and one of Genghis Khan's wives before that. With the help of Chagatai and her sons, T\u00f6regene took complete power as regent in spring 1242 as Great Khatun and removed her old husband's ministers and made new people she liked ministers, the most important of whom was Fatima, a Tajik or Persian woman who was a prisoner of war from the Middle Eastern campaign. She was a Shiite Muslim who was moved from the city of Meshed to Mongolia even though she did not want to.\nShe tried to put some of \u00d6gedei's main officials in jail. Her husband's chief secretary, Chinqai, and another important person in the government, Mahmud Yalavach went to her son Koden in North China while an important Turkestani, Masud Begh, ran to Batu Khan in Russia. In Iran, T\u00f6regene put Korguz in jail and handed over him to the wife of Chagatai, whose husband was dead, and Korguz he had not agreed with Chagati. The Chagatayid Khan Qara H\u00fcl\u00ebg\u00fc killed him. T\u00f6regene made Arghun Aqa of the Oirat as governor in Persia.\nShe made Abd-ur-Rahman ruler in North China, and Fatima became even more powerful at the Mongol court. This made the rich Mongols into ask for a lot of money for their work.\nRole in Mongol conquests.\nT\u00f6regene was friends with \u00d6gedei's commanders in China. The fighting between the Mongols and the Song soldiers was in Chengdu. T\u00f6regene sent people to make peace, but Song put them in prison. The Mongols put Hangzhou in prison and attacked Sichuan in 1242. She then told Zhang Rou and Chagaan (Tsagaan) to attack the Song Dynasty. When they attacked the Song territory, the Song court sent somebody to ceasefire. Chagaan and Zhang Rou went north back to their homes after the Mongols accepted the term.\nDuring the reign of \u00d6gedei, the Seljuks of Rum wanted friendship and gave money Chormaqan every year. Under Kaykhusraw II, however, the Mongols began to pressure the Sultan to go to Mongolia himself, give people whom he put in jail, and accept a Mongol darughachi. Mongol raids began in 1240. The Seljuk Sultan Kaykhusraw made a large army to meet them. The king of Cilician Armenia was required to give 1400 lances and the Greek Emperor of Nicaea 400 lances. Both rulers met the Sultan in Kayseri to talk. The Grand Komnenos of Trebizond gave 200 lances, while the young Ayyubid prince of Aleppo gave 1000 horsemen.In addition to these, Kaykhusraw told the Seljuq army and Turkmen cavalry, though both had been weakened by the Baba Ishak rebellion. However, Baiju and his Georgian helpers defeated them at the battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f in 1243. After that battle, the Sultanate of Rum, the Empire of Trebizond and the Lesser Armenia quickly declared their allegiance one by one to the Mongol Empire ruled by T\u00f6regene Khatun.\nThe Mongol troops under general Baiju probed the forces of Abbasid Iraq and Ayubid ruled Syria in 1244\u201346.\nG\u00fcy\u00fck's coronation.\nShe was an powerful person in a society that was usually led only by men. She was able to control the many powers within the empire, and even within the family of Genghis Khan, over a 5-year period in which she not only ruled the empire, but helped her son G\u00fcy\u00fck as Great Khan become ruler. During T\u00f6regene's reign, people arrived from the far away parts of the empire to her capital at Karakorum or to her moving imperial camp. The Seljuk sultan came from Turkey\u2014as did people from the Caliph of Abbasid in Baghdad. So did two people wanting the throne of Georgia: David Ulu, the son of the old king that could not legally take the throne\u2014and David Narin, the son of the same king who could. The highest-ranking European was Alexander Nevsky's father, Grand Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir and Suzdal, who died just after eating dinner with T\u00f6regene Khatun.\nThe Mongols did polygamy, meaning they married many people each. \u00d6gedei Khan's favorite son was Kochu, who was his son but not T\u00f6regene's, rather another wife of his. He had chose Kochu's son Siremun to become ruler after him because his father suddenly died in China in 1237. But some sources say that Khoch was a son of T\u00f6regene and she did not want Shiremun to succeed. T\u00f6regene did not agree the choice in favor of G\u00fcy\u00fck, but despite the huge influence she had on him, she was not able to make \u00d6gedei to change his mind. She did what she wanted through clever planning and trickery. When the lesser Khans made her regent after her husband died, she gave her favorite people high positions in the imperial household and started what was a good plan to make her son G\u00fcy\u00fck become ruler. When Tem\u00fcge Otchigen, the youngest brother of Genghis, made an army and tried to take the throne, though he did not, G\u00fcy\u00fck quickly came to meet him. T\u00f6regene managed to keep a Kurultai from happening until it was sure her son G\u00fcy\u00fck was liked by the most people. T\u00f6regene gave power onto her son G\u00fcy\u00fck in 1246. She retired west to \u00d6gedei's appanage on the Emil.\nDespite her planning in making sure G\u00fcy\u00fck's election as Khagan, the relationship between T\u00f6regene and her son eventually became bad. G\u00fcy\u00fck's brother Koden said Fatima was using witchcraft to make him sick; when Koden died a few months later, G\u00fcy\u00fck continuously said that his mother let Fatima be killed. T\u00f6regene threatened her son G\u00fcy\u00fck that she would commit suicide to spite him. G\u00fcy\u00fck's men took Fatima and killed her by sewing up her nose, mouth and ears and drowning her; People who helped or liked T\u00f6regene in the imperial household were also killed. After 18 months of Fatima's death, T\u00f6regene herself died because of unknown reasons. She was later called Empress Zhaoci () after her death by Kublai in 1265-1266."}

In 1977, Quebec declared Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day the national day of Quebec.\nOther Canadian provinces and territories also have their own official holidays celebrating the foundation of their provinces or territories. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day differs from them, that it is today celebrated like a national day rather than a religious holiday, because it became highly politicized with the rise of Quebec nationalism and separatism. As a result, the religious symbolism of this day is largely forgotten, and acts as a counter holiday for Quebec nationalists and separatists against Canada Day."}

It lives in New Zealand. This bird does not fly. It runs on the ground.\nAppearance.\nThe southern brown kiwi is about 45 cm long. The adult male kiwi weighs about 2.4 kilograms and the adult female weighs about 3.1 kilograms. The birds living on Stewart Island are the largest. It has red-brown feathers and no tail. It has a long, curved beak. The nostrils are at the end of the beak and not up at the top near the rest of its face.\nHabitat and food.\nThe southern brown kiwi lives in forests, scrublands, grasslands and up in hills below the Alpine zone.\nBefore human settlement of New Zealand tokoeka were widespread throughout the southern and eastern part of the South Island as far north as North Canterbury.\nMost southern brown kiwis hide during the day in burrows, areas with plants or hollow trees and look for food at night, but others look for food during the day. They walk along the ground and tap their beaks against it. They eat animals without bones, for example earthworms, insect larvae, centipedes, spiders and weta. Kiwis fight each other over good places to find food.\nThe kiwi's closest relative is the elephant bird. It lived in Madagascar long ago. Its closest living relatives are the emu and cassowary.\nEggs.\nBoth male and female southern brown kiwi sit on the eggs in the nest. Sometimes other adult kiwi will help too.\nThreats.\nBefore human beings came to live in New Zealand, the southern brown kiwi lived all through the south and east of New Zealand's South Island. There are fewer southern brown kiwi today because human beings change the places where they live and because dogs, cats, stoats and other introduced species eat them. To save the southern brown kiwi, some humans take their eggs and chicks and raise them on islands where there are no stoats.\nSubspecies.\nThere are two or three subspecies of southern brown kiwi: Everyone agrees that the Fiordland tokoeka (\"A. a. australis\") and the Stewart Island tokoeka (\"A. a. lawryi\") are subspecies. Scientists do not think that the Haast tokoeka (\"A. a. Haast\") is a real subspecies, but the people trying to keep the birds alive decided it was easier to save the birds if they acted as if it were a third subspecies.\nHistory.\nFor years, historians disagreed about where Western scientists found the first kiwi specimen, meaning the first dead kiwi that they brought back to universities for study. The first speciimen is usually the one scientists use as a holotype. The holotype is the individual plant or animal that scientists use for the first formal scientific writeup of a species.\nGeorge Shaw from the British Museum wrote the first paper about the kiwi in 1813 in his group of books \"Vivarium naturae\". A friend had brought him the kiwi skin. The friend got it from a ship captain named Andrew Barclay. He was captain of a fighting ship and prisoner transport ship called the \"Providence\". It wasn't clear exactly where the ship captain got it.\nIn 2019, scientists took a tiny piece of the kiwi skin and did DNA analysis. They found the dead kiwi was most closely related to kiwis from Rakiura, an island south of New Zealand's South Island."}

If the frogs begin to dry out, they spread the waxy substance over their skin.\nReproduction.\nThese frogs put their eggs on leaves above water. They put jelly next to the eggs. Then the frogs fold the leaves around the eggs with their legs. The jelly acts as a plug so the eggs do not fall out. When the tadpoles hatch, the jelly turns to liquid and the tadpoles fall through into the water below.\nScientific classification.\nMost of these species are in \"Phyllomedusa\", but some scientists say some of these frogs should be in \"Pithecopus\" instead.\nScientists used to put some other frogs in \"Phyllomedusa\", but now they put them in other phyllomedusid genera: \"Callimedusa\" and \"Pithecopus\"."}

The hurricane threatened Long Island in southeastern New York State and southern New England. Henri threatened being the first hurricane to move across Long Island since Hurricane Gloria in September 1985 and into New England since Hurricane Bob just over thirty years earlier.\nHenri was first classified by the National Hurricane Center as Tropical Depression Eight around 11:00 pm Atlantic Standard Time on August 16. Later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri. \nTropical storm and hurricane notices were put into effect over Long Island, northeastern New Jersey and southern New England. The first such notices extended from Newark and New York City eastward to near Martha's Vineyard and Woods Hole on Cape Cod in southeast Massachusetts.\nThe state governors of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and Connecticut put states of emergency into effect in advance of the hurricane moving into these areas. The storm was reminiscent of Hurricane Sandy almost nine years earlier (Sandy struck land near Brigantine and Atlantic City in southeast New Jersey). The winds, however, extended almost a thousand miles from the storm's center. Hurricane-force winds from Sandy also affected the New York City and Long Island areas.\nHenri was forecast to strengthen before moving across Long Island and into New England on August 22."}

It lives in New Zealand. This bird does not fly. It runs on the ground.\nAppearance.\nThe Stewart Island tokoeka is the largest type of southern brown kiwi. It has red-brown feathers that look like fur. It has small wings and does not fly. It has a long, curved bill, or beak. The nostrils are at the end of the bill, not at the top near the rest of its face. Experts think the kiwi can smell very well.\nHabitat and family.\nAbout 20,000 Stewart Island tokoeka live on Stewart Island. Unlike other kiwis, they look for food during the day and at night instead of only at night.\nUnlike other kiwis, the Stewart Island tokoeka does not live alone. Instead, Stewart Island tokoeka live in families. The baby kiwis stay with their parents for up to seven years. They help sit in their parents' younger eggs. This makes it so much easier to raise eggs that kiwi parents sometimes have two clutches, groups of eggs, each year. It also goes onto the beach to look for food, which most other kiwis do not do.\nThreats.\nMustelids, for example stoats, never came to Stewart Island the way they came to the rest of New Zealand as invasive species. So the Stewart Island tokoeka does not have stoats that try to eat its eggs and chicks. However, there are stray cats on Stewart Island, and they can be very big."}

All three used to work with Buzzfeed. Bergara and Madej did \"BuzzFeed Unsolved\". Steven Lim did the Buzzfeed food show \"Worth It\". The series started in January 2020.\nOn \"Puppet History\", a colorful puppet historian leads a game show, a contest. Each episode is about one strange thing from history. The two people in the contest answer questions, and the Professor gives them points.\nFormat.\n\"Puppet History\" is not fiction. All the historical events on the show are real.\n\"Welcome one and all to Puppet History. Today we take an ever-widening look into the heavy heavy book we call history while our guests ruthlessly compete for the coveted title of History Master! I am obviously your beloved host, the Professor!\" - the Professor at the beginning of most episodes\nThe show begins with the Professor, a blue puppet voiced by Shane Madej, saying hello to the guests from a puppet theater stage. He then tells a story about history. He stops every few minutes to ask the two guests a question. They are sometimes multiple choice and sometimes not. The guests write down their answers on whiteboards. Then the professor says \"Let's see the answer through the magic of theater!\" and paper cutouts of the people from history act out the answer to the question. Then the professor gives \"jelly beans\" to whoever had the true answer. Each jelly bean is worth one point.\nThe Professor encourages the guests to speak and tell jokes. Sometimes, he will give a \"rotten jelly bean\" to whoever makes a bad joke. The rotten jelly bean is worth negative one points. The Professor gives the special guest extra points. This way, Ryan Bergara always loses.\nBefore the end of the show, the Professor leaves to \"tally the score\" and another puppet comes onto the stage and sings a song about the historical event.\nThe show always ends with the \"coveted cup and title of History Master\" going to the guest who is not Ryan Bergara. The cup is usually a small plastic trophy with real jelly bean candy in it. Sometimes it contains a small piece of \"Puppet History\" merchandise, for example a pin.\nEpisodes.\nIn season one, Ryan Bergara and the other contestant sat in chairs in the same room as the puppet theater. In seasons two and three, the show was \"Puppet History: Online University\" and both contestants appeared through computers. This was because of the coronavirus pandemic. Each episode has about 1 million views.\nProfessor.\nThe Professor is a small hand puppet with blue fur and a white nose. He usually wears a safari hat and jacket and carries a satchel, or large bag. He wears glasses and a bow tie. Sometimes, he wears other costumes. For example, in the episode about Ching Shih, he wore a pirate hat.\nThe Professor sometimes talks about his life through wrong answers to the multiple-choice questions. These answers say the Professor found a magic lamp that had a magical genie inside it. He told the genie to turn a \"seemingly ordinary household object\" into a secret time machine. The genie did so, but was also \"a total prick about it.\" In the flashbacks, the genie is also played by Shane Manej."}

It doesn't need to make the life expectancies of dogs shorter than usual. If not treated, however, the condition could lead to cataracts, malnutrition, diabetic ketoacidosis, dehydration and possibly death. Diabetes mostly affects middle-aged and older dogs. There are, however, juvenile cases. The typical dog with diabetes is overweight or obese and middle-aged. Females are affected almost three times more often than male dogs. But there are arguments about whether or not neutering male dogs may increase the risks of developing diabetes. Some data mention that male dogs' risks of becoming obese double or triple after they are neutered.\nDiabetes is commonly split into two types: type 1 and type 2.\nType 1 diabetes (previously called \"juvenile diabetes\") happens when the beta cells of the pancreas are either destroyed or severely damaged. The condition, in the past, was also called \"insulin-dependent diabetes\". That means insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Type 1 is the most common form of diabetes and affects approximately 0.34% of dogs. \nType 2 diabetes does develop in dogs. However, this form is not as common as type 1. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to bring about a remission (meaning no evidence of the disease) as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases. In cats, the usual type of diabetes is type 2. \nGestational diabetes does happen in dogs. The condition, though, does not happen in dogs as often as for human beings. \nGenetic susceptibility of certain breeds.\nThis list of risk factors for canine diabetes is taken from the genetic breed study. This study was published in 2007. The \"neutral risk\" category should be taken for being not enough evidence that the dog breed genetically shows a high, moderate, or a low risk for the disease. All risk information is based only on discovered genetic factors.\nHigh risk\nModerate risk\nNeutral risk\nLow risk"}

In Malaysia, there are 18 areas granted city status (\"bandar raya\") by law. However, there are also highly urbanised and populated areas that do not have city status but are sometimes colloquially also referred to as cities. City status is granted to a place within a local government area. Other populated areas which do not have city status are legally categorised as municipalities or towns.\nCities of Malaysia.\nThe following is a list of places in Malaysia in order by the date they were granted city status.\nPenang.\nGeorge Town became a city on 1 January 1957 by a royal charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the first town in the Federation of Malaya to become a city (Singapore became a city in 1951). The royal charter stated that :\"... the said Municipality of George Town shall on the First Day of January in the year of Our Lord One thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven and forever after that be a city and shall be called and styled the CITY OF GEORGE TOWN instead of the Municipality of George Town and shall thenceforth have all such rank, liberties, privileges and immunities as are incident to a City.\"However, local government elections were abolished by the federal government in 1965, and the functions of the City Council were transferred to the Chief Minister of Penang in 1966. A Municipal Council for the whole of Penang Island, the Penang Island Municipal Council, was set up between 1974 and 1976.\nAlthough the city status of George Town was never officially revoked, George Town's existence as a corporate entity was in doubt, let alone as a city. This is similar to the position of the former city of Rochester in England, the site of England's second-oldest cathedral, which had been a city from 1211 until 1998 when it was merged with a neighbouring borough. As the new council was not granted city status, and the city, through oversight, failed to appoint charter trustees to inherit the city charter, the city ceased to exist.\nMost residents disagreed with this view, who held that as George Town's city status has never been revoked, it remains a city to this day. According to lawyer Datuk Anwar Fazal, George Town \"legally has been and is still a city because the City of George Town Ordinance 1957 had not been repealed\"\".[3] As city status is a matter of law, the actual legal position will depend on an analysis of the City Council of Penang (Transfer of Functions) Order 1966 and the Local Government Act 1976.\nOn 1 January 2015, the Malaysian federal government upgraded the Penang Island Municipal Council into the present-day Penang Island City Council, thereby expanding the city limit of George Town to encompass the entirety of Penang Island, as well as a handful of surrounding islets.\nSubsequent cities.\nThe royal charters for Kuala Lumpur, Kuching, Kota Kinabalu, Shah Alam, Malacca City, Alor Setar and Miri were from the Malaysian head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, while Ipoh, Johor Bahru, Iskandar Puteri and Subang Jaya were granted by their respective state sultans. Malacca City was declared a \"historical city\" prior to being granted city status in 2003.\nKuala Lumpur, the largest city, is the national capital and a federal territory, but as of 2012, most government ministries have relocated to the new administrative capital of Putrajaya.\nCriteria.\nAmong the latest (2008) basic criteria for granting City status on a local government is that it has a minimum population of 500,000 and an annual income of not less than RM 100 million.\nPopulation.\nKuala Lumpur is by far the largest urban area as well as the largest metropolitan area in Malaysia. George Town, the capital city of Penang, is the second-largest city in Malaysia and the heart of Malaysia's second-largest conurbation. To the south, the twin cities of Johor Bahru and Iskandar Puteri form the core of the third-largest metropolitan area in the country. Other metropolitan areas with a population of more than 500,000 include Ipoh, Kuching, and Kota Kinabalu.\nThe following table shows the largest cities by population in Malaysia."}
{"id": "865978", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=865978", "title": "States and federal territories of Malaysia", "text": "The states and federal territories of Malaysia are the principal administrative divisions of Malaysia. Malaysia is a federation of 13 states (\"Negeri\") and 3 federal territories (\"Wilayah Persekutuan\").\nStates and federal territories.\n11 states and 2 federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula, collectively called \"Peninsular Malaysia\" (\"Semenanjung Malaysia\") or \"West Malaysia\". 2 states are on the island of Borneo, and the remaining federal territory consists of islands offshore of Borneo; they are collectively referred to as \"East Malaysia\" or Malaysian Borneo. Out of the 13 states in Malaysia, 9 are monarchies.\nRestoration of Sabah and Sarawak status.\nIn conjunction with the celebration of Malaysia Day in 2018 under the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has promised to restore Sabah and Sarawak status in the Malaysian federation in accordance with the Malaysia Agreement, changing \"their status from merely a state to an equal partner of the Malayan states\". Although the status of both entities were clearly defined in Article I, Malaysia Agreement 1963 as 'states' which shall be federated with the existing states of the Federation of Malaya. However, through the process of the amendment, the bill failed to pass following the failure to reach two-thirds majority support (148 votes) in the Parliament with only 138 agreed with the move while 59 abstained from the voting. Nevertheless, the Malaysian federal government agreed to review the 1963 agreement to remedy breaches of the treaty with the \"Special Cabinet Committee To Review the Malaysia Agreement\" and directed a Special Task Force Team (Taskforce MA63) to prepare a final report on the 1963 agreement before 31 August 2019.\nGovernance.\nThe governance of the states is divided between the federal government and the state governments, while the federal territories are directly administered by the federal government. The specific responsibilities of the federal and the state governments are listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia. Theoretically, any matter not set out in the Ninth Schedule can be legislated on by the individual states. However, legal scholars generally view this as a \"pauper's bequest\" because of the large scope of the matters listed in the Ninth Schedule. The courts themselves have generally favoured a broad interpretation of the language of the Ninth Schedule, thus limiting the number of possible subjects not covered. The Ninth Schedule specifically lists the following matters as those that can only be legislated on by the states: land tenure, the Islamic religion, and local government.\nNine of the peninsular states, based on historical Malay kingdoms, are known as the Malay states. Each Malay state has a hereditary ruler as titular head of state and an executive Chief Minister or \"Menteri Besar\" as politically responsible head of government. The rulers of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu are styled Sultans. Negeri Sembilan's elective ruler holds the title of \"Yamtuan Besar\", whereas the ruler of Perlis is titled \"Raja\". The federal head of state, the \"Yang di-Pertuan Agong\" (commonly referred to as \"King\" in English) is elected (de facto rotated) among the nine rulers to serve a 5-year term. Former British settlements and crown colonies of Penang and Malacca (both peninsular), and Sabah and Sarawak (both on Borneo) each have a titular Governor (styled \"Yang di-Pertua Negeri\") appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and an executive Chief Minister or \"Ketua Menteri\".\nSabah and Sarawak have additional powers over their immigration controls as part of the 20-point agreement and 18-point agreement drawn up by respective states when they, together with the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, formed Malaysia. They have separate immigration policies and controls and a unique residency status. Passports are required even for Peninsular Malaysians for travelling between either state and Peninsular Malaysia, or between the two states, however those who are on social/business visits up to three months are allowed to produce a MyKad or birth certificate and obtain a special printout form in lieu of a passport.\nEach state has a unicameral legislature called \"Dewan Undangan Negeri\" (\"DUN\", State Assembly). Members of DUN are elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on population. The state leader of the majority party in DUN is usually appointed Chief Minister by the Ruler or Governor. The term of DUN members is five years unless the assembly is dissolved earlier by the Ruler or Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. Usually, DUN of the states in Peninsular Malaysia are dissolved in conjunction with the dissolution of the federal parliament, to have state elections running concurrently with the parliamentary election. However, Rulers and Governors hold discretionary powers in withholding consent to dissolve the DUN. Each state sends two senators elected by the DUN to the \"Dewan Negara\" (Senate), the upper house of the federal parliament.\nThe Parliament of Malaysia is permitted to legislate on issues of land, Islamic religion and local government to provide for a uniform law between different states, or on the request of the state assembly concerned. The law in question must also be passed by the state assembly as well, except in the case of certain land law-related subjects. Non-Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated on at the federal level for the purpose of conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations. Each state is further divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into \"Divisions\".\nThe 3 federal territories were formed for different purposes: Kuala Lumpur is the national capital, Putrajaya is the administrative centre of the federal government, and Labuan serves as an offshore financial centre. Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya were carved out of Selangor, while Labuan was ceded by Sabah. The territories fall under the purview of the Ministry of the Federal Territories, and the Parliament of Malaysia legislates on all matters concerning the territories. Each federal territory elects representatives from single-member constituencies drawn based on population to the \"Dewan Rakyat\" (House of Representatives) of the Parliament. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints senators to represent the territories in the Dewan Negara; Kuala Lumpur has two senators, while Putrajaya and Labuan each has one.\nThe local governments for the territories varies: Kuala Lumpur is administered by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (\"Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur\"), headed by an appointed mayor (\"Datuk Bandar\"), while Putrajaya is administered by the Putrajaya Corporation (\"Perbadanan Putrajaya\") and Labuan by the Labuan Corporation (\"Perbadanan Labuan\"); each corporation is headed by a chairman.\nSabah and Sarawak.\nThe states of Sabah and Sarawak merged with the existing states of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore pursuant to the Malaysia Agreement in 1963 to form the independent state of Malaysia. Representatives from Sabah and Sarawak demanded a higher degree of autonomy as part of the bargain which were included in the 20-point agreement and 18-point agreement respectively. It has also been argued that Sabah and Sarawak have equal status to that of Malaya as a whole, however the Constitution of Malaysia have listed both these entities as merely 2 of the 13 states of Malaysia, suggesting an equal status with the states of Malaya. Sabah and Sarawak still retains a relatively higher degree of autonomy compared to the peninsular states in areas such as immigration, some control over state revenue and legislative power over land and local government.\nSingapore and Brunei.\nSingapore was a Malaysian state from the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 until it was expelled from the Federation on 9 August 1965. During its time as a state of Malaysia, Singapore had autonomy in the areas of education and labour and was the smallest state in Malaysia by land area.\nBrunei was invited to join the Federation but decided not to at the end due to several issues, such as the status of the Sultan within Malaysia, division of Bruneian oil royalties, and pressure from opposition groups which amounted to the Brunei Revolt."}

He is the Owner Chairman &amp; CEO of Swift Engineering since 1991. He is the first and only Japanese driver to win the Toyota Atlantic Championship (Pacific) in 1989 and also the first Japanese driver to race at the Indianapolis 500 (Indy 500).\nEarly life.\nMatsushita was born in Nishinomiya city, Japan, and graduated from Konan University. He is the grandson of K\u014dnosuke Matsushita, founder of Panasonic, and son of Masaharu Matsushita, who served as the second president of Panasonic for sixteen years beginning in 1961. His relationship has allowed him to receive financial backing from Panasonic throughout his racing career.\nRacing career.\nMatsushita started his career racing motorcycles in his home country between 1977 and 1979, before making the switch to four wheels. With Panasonic's backing, he then moved to the United States and entered his first Formula Ford race in 1986. He finished second at the 24 Hours of Daytona and third at the Sebring 12 Hours in 1988. Matsushita began to make his name known by winning the 1989 Champ Car Atlantic Championshipchampionship (Pacific division) with the largest point margin of all time.\nHe graduated to Champ Car in 1990, scoring one point in his debut season. Inexplicably, he never showed the pace that took him to four Atlantic victories; instead, he quickly earned a reputation for being at the tail end of the grid, always outperformed by his teammates. Nonetheless, he became the first Japanese driver to race in the Indianapolis 500 in 1991 and followed that achievement with a top ten finish at Milwaukee Mile|Milwaukee. Matsushita missed the 1992 Indianapolis 500 after suffering a broken leg during a practice crash. He was sidelined for several weeks and missed the next six events as well.\nAt the Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix race in 1994, Matsushita endured a horrific crash in which his car was cut in half by Jacques Villeneuve's car traveling at nearly full speed. He emerged from his destroyed car with only minor injuries. The same year, he earned his best career finish of 6th position at the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway. This result was made possible by an extraordinarily high rate of attrition that saw only 8 cars finish the race. Matsushita was 11 laps behind the leader at the drop of the checkered flag.\nBy the time he retired in 1998, Matsushita had started 117 Champ Car races for Dick Simon Racing, Walker Racing, Arciero/Wells Racing, and Dale Coyne Racing|Payton/Coyne. He holds the record for most starts in American Championship Car Racing history without scoring a Top 5.\nIn 2001, Matsushita competed in the Baja 1000 off-road race, in a Mitsubishi Montero.\nPersonal life.\nAway from the track, Matsushita owns Swift Engineering, an American engineering firm known for producing racing cars for a variety of open-wheel racing series, including Formula Ford, Formula Atlantic, the Champ Car World Series, and Formula Nippon. He bought Swift in 1991. Matsushita resides in San Clemente, California."}

It is a bird in the order Pelecaniformes. It is the only living species in the genus Balaeniceps and the family Balaenicipitidae. \nThe bird looks similar to a stork, but can be easily told apart by its famous shoe-shaped beak. The shoebill lives in East Africa, in parts of Sudan, Ethiopia, DR Congo, Zambia, and the Central African Republic. \nThe IUCN says that the shoebill is vulnerable. There are thought to be around 5,0008,000 shoebills in the world, but the population might be as big as 10,000. The birds are at risk because of habitat destruction and hunting.\nTaxonomy.\nThe shoebill was first described by John Gould in 1850. He gave it the scientific name (a two-part name given to types of plants and animals) \"Balaeniceps rex\". The shoebill is also sometimes called the shoebill stork, shoe-billed stork, or bogbird.\nStudies of the shoebill's DNA have shown that the shoebill is in its own family, Balaenicipitidae. These studies have also shown that it is closely related to the pelicans, and so it is now put in the order Pelecaniformes. \nDescription.\nThe shoebill is a large, tall bird that is around tall and weighing for males and for females. Males and females look almost the same, but males are a little larger. The birds are easily told apart by their shoe-shaped beak. They are mostly grey in color, with their belly being whitish. The wings are darker than the rest of the body, and the upper body is slightly greenish in color. The beak is usually straw-colored with blackish marks, while the iris (the non-black part of the eye) can be yellow, grey, or whitish in color. The beak has a hook-like end that helps catch fish. Younger birds look similar to adults, but are more brownish and have smaller, more pinkish beaks.\nWhen it is flying, the shoebill looks like other storks and herons. It can be told apart by the shape of its beak and its bluish-grey color.\nSounds.\nThe shoebill is mostly silent. Sometimes, they do bill-clattering displays near their nests. During these displays, they sometimes make \"moo\" sounds that are like a cow's. They make high-pitched \"beeeeeh\" sounds near their nests, and might also make loud sounds when flying. Young shoebills are known to make sounds that are like human hiccups when they want food.\nDistribution.\nThe shoebill lives in marshes from southern Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia to southern DR Congo and northern Zambia. It is also sometimes found in the Central African Republic. It also lives in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. The areas that it lives in are mostly places that also have papyrus and lungfish. It does not migrate, but sometimes moves to different areas when the water level changes.\nIt likes marshes that have papyrus, reeds, cattails, and grasses. It sometimes lives in marshy areas next to lakes and in places where the water have very little oxygen. In places with deep water, it needs floating vegetation. \nRock art from Oued Djerat in eastern Algeria shows that in the early Holocene, shoebills lived much more to the north, in wetlands where the Sahara Desert is now.\nBehaviour.\nShoebills are solitary by nature, and even their nests are spaced apart. Breeding pairs defend a territory 2 to 4 from others of their species.\nDiet.\nThe shoebill mostly eats fish weighing up to . The main types of fish that it eats are lungfish, Senegal bichir, \"Clarias\" catfish, and tilapia. It also eats amphibians, young crocodiles, water snakes, rodents, and young waterfowl. The shoebill likes to hunt in areas where the water has less oxygen, because fish in these areas have to come up to breathe. The animals that the shoebill eats depends on where it lives. For example, it mainly eats lungfish and catfish in Uganda, but mainly eats catfish and water snakes in Zambia.\nStatus.\nThe IUCN says that the shoebill is vulnerable."}

They are also threatened by invasive species, which are animals brought to New Zealand by humans, for example, dogs, cats, and stoats.\nIn the Haast Kiwi Sanctuary, human beings put traps to catch stoats. Stoats are animals like weasels. They were brought to New Zealand by humans, and they eat kiwi chicks.\nBreeding.\nThe kiwis make a nest in a hollow log, crack in a rock or space dug out of the ground. The egg is large and pale green in color. The male and female kiwi both sit on the egg."}

It was discovered in 2003. It is found in a protected area of the Okarito forest on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island. There are only about 600 Okarito brown kiwis.\nAppearance.\nThis bird has gray-brown feathers. It sometimes has white feathers on its face. Its legs, feet and claws are pale. It has small wings and does not fly. It has no tail. It has a long pale bill, or beak.\nHabitat.\nBefore humans came to New Zealand, there were Okarito brown kiwi all through the northern part of the South Island and the southern part of the North Island. However, in 1990, there were 160 rowi left in all New Zealand. In 2012, there were about 375.\nThese rowi live in Okarito, where they build nests and lay eggs themselves. Human beings sometimes take eggs and chicks to islands where they can grow up without stoats or other mammal predators eating them, but the kiwi do not go to those islands on their own. This is part of Operation Nest Egg.\nBreeding.\nThe kiwis make a nest in a hollow log, crack in a rock or space dug out of the ground. The male and female kiwi both sit on the egg. The female kiwi lays only one egg at a time, but sometimes she will lay one new egg just before the old one hatches."}

The group has been known since August 2021 - during the 2021 Taliban offensive.\nThe group had \"de facto\" control over the Panjshir Valley, as of early September 2021; but on September 6, 2021, there was heavy fighting and many deaths on both sides; the Taliban took control of the house that has the governor's office in Bazarak; and the Taliban took control of most of the Panjshir province.\nThe leaders of the resistance group are the politicians Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh (the vice president in the government that lost power over most of Afghanistan in August 2021).\nMassoud escaped to Tajikistan [sometime between September 6 and September 21]; Saleh escaped (by helicopter) a few days after Massoud; The two have not been seen in public, after their escape, said \"The Intercept\" on September 21; Its sources are \"a senior U.S. intelligence official, a Pentagon consultant, and two former senior Afghan government officials\".\nThe name \"second resistance\" follows the name of the \"first resistance\" - a fight between the Northern Alliance (and a few other groups) against the Taliban from 1993 to the early 2000s.\nTimeline of the Panjshir conflict.\nMedia said in August, that \"There have been messages among\" American and British former soldiers and former private security contractors (that had worked in Afghanistan); the messages are saying that Afghans outside the country are \"starting to\ngather\" money for raising [or building] \"private forces [...] to fight the Taliban\".\nAs of September 9, researchers at \"Bellingcat\" said that intelligence from publicly available sources, shows that the Taliban control territory at least into the valley. The Taliban has placed the valley under siege, and journalists or goods can not come into the valley; That is why media said that is difficult to know how much control the Taliban have.\nOne investigative report was published by BBC on 13 September; The report found that the Taliban had executed at least 20 civilians in Panjshir since they went into the valley. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, on the other hand, denied the group had done any human rights violation in the province. Journalists from Agence France-Presse were let into Panjshir on 15 September; They found many villages in the three districts they visited nearly empty; Residents told the journalists that the Taliban had executed 19 civilians between the village of Khenj and Bazarak; Residents also said that civilians were being (stopped or) prevented from escaping the province, so that civilians could be used as human shields during attacks by resistance fighters.\nA doctor in Panjshir told Al Jazeera that all hospitals in the province had been closed or were operating on limited supplies, except for an emergency hospital staffed by Italians."}

A metal tank broke, and the 2.3 million gallons of molasses in it poured out onto Commercial Street.\nBackground.\nMolasses is a sweet-tasting liquid. It is left over when people make sugar out of sugar cane or sugar beets. It can be used to make rum, a sweet alcohol drink, and it is an ingredient in Boston baked beans. In the early 20th century, many people in the West used molasses to sweeten their food because white sugar cost too much money.\nCauses.\nShips brought molasses to Boston from the sugar farms in the Caribbean Sea. In Boston, people made rum out of molasses in factories called distilleries. But the molasses had to be stored until rum makers were ready. This was right before alcohol would become illegal in the United States, so people wanted to make and sell rum while they still could. One company, U.S. Industrial Alcohol, put their molasses in a 50-foot (15-meter) steel tank at 529 Commercial Street in Boston's North End neighborhood.\nThe people in the North End said it made strange noises. The tank was not very old, but it leaked. Families would send children to go and take molasses from the leak. U.S. Industrial Alcohol painted the tank brown so the children could not find the leaks to steal molasses, but they did not fix the leaks. On January 13, two days before the flood, even more hot molasses was poured into the tank.\nEngineer Ronald Mayville says the tank broke because the steel was not thick enough.\nEvent.\nAt about 12:30 p.m. on January 15, the molasses tank broke. 2.3 million gallons (8.7 million liters) of molasses spilled out onto Commercial Street. The wave of molasses was 30 feet (9 meters) high and moved at 35 miles per hour (55 kph). Pieces of the tank flew into houses and broke holes in walls. One piece flew into one of the pillars holding up an elevated train track and broke it. A train stopped just in time.\nBecause the molasses was sticky, people in it could not get out. When the tank first broke, some of the molasses was still hot, so it moved fast at first. But it cooled down quickly in the cold winter air. So people and other animals fell into warm, soft molasses that got hard around them, and they could not get out. When it covered people's noses and mouths, they could not breathe.\nThe molasses spread out to other streets. Soon, there was 2-3 feet (up to 1 meter) of molasses on the ground. A police officer was in a signal box talking to his police group when the tank broke. Because he was already sending a message to other police officers, he called for help right away. Rescue workers came to the North End, but they could not walk or drive carts through the molasses.\nSome rescuers tried to get a man out of the molasses by pulling on his arm. The molasses was so hard that they pulled his arm off by accident.\nCasualties.\n21 people and many horses died. 150 people were hurt. Some of the dead people were not found until days later. Because of the molasses, it was hard for people to tell which people they were.\nCleanup.\nPeople who went to the North End got molasses on their clothes and shoes. When they went to other parts of Boston, the molasses fell off. Soon every street in Boston had molasses on it. Many of the train car seats and public telephones were sticky.\nThe people used hoses from fireboats to wash the molasses into Boston Harbor with seawater. The water in the harbor was brown for months. People say they can still smell molasses on hot days.\nLawsuit.\nSoon after the flood, 199 people sued U.S. Industrial Alcohol. The lawsuit took six years and there were more than 3000 people who spoke in court. This was the first lawsuit in United States History that had many expert witnesses: Engineers, architects, and other building experts talked about the tank in court, for example metal scientist Albert Colby, Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineer George E. Russell, and Harvard University's George F. Swain.\nDuring the lawsuit, there were three ideas about why the flood happened: 1) Yeast or other very small living things in the tank ate the molasses and gave off carbon dioxide gas, which made the tank explode, 2) someone put a bomb in the tank, or 3) the tank was not built well. Eventually, the court decided that the tank was not built well, and that U.S. Industrial Alcohol caused the flood with this unsafe tank. U.S. Industrial Alcohol settled with some people out of court too. Families got about US$7000 per dead person. The company paid somewhere from $500,000 to $100,000.\nHistorian Stephen Puleo says that this case set the precedent, a way of doing things for the future: Americans began to think that building inspectors should look at tanks and other buildings to see if they are safe, that engineers need to write plans for their buildings, and that architects need to show their blueprints.\nMemorials.\nThe Bostonian Society put a small green marker on Commercial Street in the 1990s."}

Kalakani was a native of Kalakan, a village thirty kilometers north of Kabul. In late November, they put siege to Jabal al-Siraj, north of Kabul, and on either 11 or 12 December, after 18 days of siege, Ahmad Ali Lodi surrendered the citadel, and handed over (or gave) all government funds as well as 18 machine guns, and some heavy weapons and rifles.\nAfter king Amanullah's loss of power (January 1929).\nRule by king Kalakani, and Saqqawist offensives (February \u2013 August 1929).\nKalakani became King of Afghanistan.\nAli Ahmad Khan was captured; his reign ended on 9 February.\nKalakan's forces did fight anti-Saqqawist tribes.\nSaqqawist collapse, and end of the civil war (August \u2013 October 1929).\nOn 8 August, an anti-Saqqawist uprising took place in Bamyan, Ghuri and Baghlan, blocking Kalakani's force's route to Turkistan and forcing them to retreat to Ghurband. On 21 August, the Sayyid of Shaykh Ali started an offensive (or attack) against Kalakani, advancing as far as Khanabad, Andarab and Ghurband. On 26 August, there were rumours in Kabul that Hazara settlers successfully attacked Mazar-i Sharif. In early September, the Saqqawists won their last victory by taking Jalalabad. On 23 September, a pro-Nadir uprising in Kandahar succeeded at driving out Kalakani's forces from the city. On 29 September, a pro-Nadir force under Shah Wali crossed the Durand Line and occupied Khushi. On the 30th, he sent a 1000-man force ahead to Tangi Waghjan, the gorge on the road to the Logar Valley. On 3 October, after an intense battle, anti-Saqqawist forces captured the town of Muhammad Aghah, placing themselves within striking distance of Kabul. Kalakani himself took part in this battle, trying to lift his soldier's spirits, to no avail. anti-Saqqawist forces continued to slowly push towards Kabul, seizing Charasya, Chihil Tan and Chihil Sutun on 5 October. By 7 October, Kalakani's forces had retreated from almost all territory outside Kabul, and prepared for their last stand. \nOn 9 October, after dozens of hours of street fighting in Kabul, the Arg was put under siege. On 13 October, after several days of bombardment, Nadir's forces entered the Arg. After a battle, the Arg was captured, and the civil war ended."}

In 1827, the Greek Third National Assembly entrusted the governance of the fledgling nation to Ioannis Kapodistrias, who arrived in Greece in January 1828. Alongside his efforts to lay the foundations for a modern state, Kapodistrias undertook negotiations with the Great Powers as to the extent and constitutional status of the new Greek state.\nIn March 1829, the foreign ministers of the Great Powers signed the first London Protocol, according to which Greece would become an autonomous, tributary state under Ottoman suzerainty, under an elected Christian prince and encompassing the heartlands of the Greek uprising, the Morea (Peloponnese), Continental Greece and the Cyclades. Kapodistrias' diplomatic manoeuvres, aided by the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u201329, resulted in a revision of the protocol on 3 February 1830. According to it, Greece would be fully independent from the Ottoman Empire, but its borders were reduced to the Aspropotamos\u2013Spercheios line. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (the future King of Belgium) was selected as the first King of Greece, but he rejected the offer.\nThe protocol was yet again amended in the London Conference of 1832, which established the final borders of the Kingdom of Greece and gave the crown to the Bavarian prince Otto."}

There are actually several species of \"giant clams\" in the genus \"Tridacna\", which are often misidentified for \"Tridacna gigas\", the most commonly intended species referred to as \u201cthe giant clam\u201d.\n\"Tridacna gigas\" is one of the most endangered clam species. Antonio Pigafetta documented these in his journal as early as 1521. One of a number of large clam species native to the shallow coral reefs of the South Pacific and Indian oceans, they can weigh more than , measure as much as across and have an average lifespan in the wild of over 100 years. They are also found off the shores of the Philippines and in the South China Sea in the coral reefs of Sabah (Malaysian Borneo).\nThe giant clam lives in flat coral sand or broken coral and can be found at depths of as much as 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft). Its range covers the Indo-Pacific, but populations are diminishing quickly, and the giant clam has become extinct in many areas where it was once common. The maxima clam is found most commonly among giant clam species; it can be found off high- or low-elevation islands, in lagoons or fringing reefs. Its rapid growth rate is likely due to its ability to grow algae in its body tissue.\nAlthough larval clams are planktonic, they become sessile in adulthood. The creature's mantle tissues act as a home for the symbiotic single-celled dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthellae) from which the adult clams get most of their food. By day, the clam opens its shell and extends its mantle tissue so that the algae get the sunlight they need to photosynthesize."}

Archeological studies show men/boys and women/girls wore trousers and pants in relation to past societal cultures. For most of modern history, though, wearing pants/trousers was usually restricted to men and boys. In several regions across the world, such patterns were applied not just by social rules but also through laws.\nDifferent United States cities, in the 19th and 20th centuries, passed legislation that banned women and girls from wearing trousers/pants. One such law was passed by the San Francisco Supervisors' Board in 1863. This law made appearing in public wearing clothes of the opposite sex (males wearing female clothing or females wearing male clothes) illegal. Similar laws were already in effect for Chicago (passed in 1851) and Columbus, Ohio (passed in 1848). Further laws against cross-dressing were put into effect for Houston, Texas (passed in 1864) and Orlando, Florida (went into effect in 1907). Another almost two dozen United States cities also had these laws. Further laws against cross-dressing were put into effect far into the 20th century. They were made effective for Detroit, Michigan and Miami, Florida as recently as the 1950s. \nEarly dress reform.\nIn 1851, early women's rights advocate Elizabeth Smith Miller introduced Amelia Bloomer to a garment originally called the \"Turkish dress\" (knee length skirts over Turkish-style clothes). Bloomer was later working for and promoting the dress. Instructions for making the dress were included. The dresses were later called bloomers.\nAnother woman who advocated publicly for dress changes was Mary Edwards Walker. She was an abolitionist in the 19th century and Civil War surgeon. Walker wore bloomers while working with a military hospital. In 1871, she wrote that women's dress should: \"protect the person, and allow freedom of motion and circulation, and not make the wearer a slave to it\". Walker publicly wore men's trousers. For doing so, she was arrested several times beginning in New York City in 1866. Other females were also arrested for similar behaviors in the 19th century.\nChanging cultures.\nUnited States and Europe.\n1890s\u20131914.\nNear the end of the 19th century, Parisian women and girls wore bloomers more often than English and American females. This might have been because the bloomers were presented for being fashionable items across France. In that country, fashion writers were against this. By 1895, though, many middle class American women and girls had adopted the bike and the bloomer. The women and girls began calling themselves 'New Women' despite the resistance from society. At that same time, these early women's and girls' trousers and pants became more diverse according to their uses for cycling, sexual stimulation and gymnastics.\n1914\u20131920.\nDuring World War I (1914\u20131918), lots of females in several countries, like France, the United States and the United Kingdom were signed up for working in factories, especially military weapons factories. These women were also hired to aid the World War I effort and replacing men in the service sectors, like public transport. Women's trousers and pants became more socially acceptable in the World War I years. This was considered daring while women went against the normal dress rules.\n1930s.\nThe 20th century actresses Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn were often photographed while wearing trousers in the 1930s. The earlier was famous for having appeared in a tuxedo and matching fedora (a hat) at the 1932 first showings of \"The Sign of the Cross\". \nEleanor Roosevelt (1884\u20131962) was the beginning First Lady appearing in trousers at a formal function. She was in charge of the 1933 Easter Egg Roll while she wore riding trousers.\n1939\u20131945.\nDuring World War II (1939\u20131945), history repeated itself in much larger scales. More women during World War II than in World War I cut their hairs and put on trousers. They did this for the task of working in factories while men were sent to battlefields. In 1942\u20131945, more American women entered the labor forces than ever before. Unlike decades before, clothing manufacturers didn't look to Parision couture designs (meaning fashionable made-to-wear clothes) for being inspired. They developed their own clothing styles within limits that were set by war-time needs.\n1946\u20131959.\nUnlike during the Interwar period (between the World Wars), women's trousers made a lasting step forward after World War II. They were used as pieces of clothing for everyday use and a fashion statement. In the years after the war, trousers/pants were still common for socializing, leisure and gardening. But apart from those, actresses like Katharine Hepburn, Audrey Hepburn (not directly related to Katharine with the same family name), Coco Chanel and Marlene Dietrich wore trousers/pants in public for uses every day. As a whole, however, most women and girls resumed everyday uses of skirts and dresses as the standard outfit in workplaces, like offices by the mid-to-late 1950s. It was in the late 1950s, during which time Capri pants became very popular, that major changes began showing."}

It lives in only on New Zealand's Chatham Islands.\nAppearance.\nIts body is smaller and thicker than the variable oystercatcher's, but they both have black and white feathers.\nHabitat and actions.\nChatham oystercatchers live in pairs. These pairs will fight other Chatham oystercatchers over good places to look for food and build nests. This bird builds nests on rocky coasts. It likes sheltered coasts the most.\nThe male and female bird both sit on the eggs. There are 1-3 eggs at a time. Male and female oystercatchers usually stay partners their whole lives, but sometimes they do not.\nFood.\nChatham oystercatchers use their beaks to dig in the sand for amphipods, polychaete worms, ribbon worms, molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, ascidians, and anemones.\nThreats.\nIn the 1970s there were as few as 50 Chatham oystercatchers alive on Chatham Island (and others on other nearby islands). By 1998, there were about 140. Conservationists tried even harder to save the birds. There were 300 Chatham oystercatchers alive by 2005.\nThis bird is threatened because human beings change the places it lives. Human beings changed the islands to make farmland, and they put marram grass on the sand dunes, which changes the way the sand flows. The dunes are steeper, so the birds must build nests closer to the water, and sometimes the high tide takes the eggs away. Humans also brought new animals to the islands in the 1800s: cats eat eggs and chicks, and weka eat eggs."}

I See You) was a 2018-2019 Indian Marathi language TV serial on the channel Zee Marathi and is now digitally available on ZEE5. It was directed by Girish Mohite and Chandrakant Lata Gaikwad and starred Gayatri Datar, Subodh Bhave in lead roles and Shilpa Tulaskar, Abhidnya Bhave in pivotal roles.\nPlot.\nIsha Nimkar is a poor middle-class girl living with her parents, Pushpa and Arun in a chawl, in Mumbai. One day, at her college, she gives a speech on Vikrant Saranjame, a rich middle-aged, widowered businessman, living in a bungalow. Somehow they meet in an auto rickshaw and Vikrant falls in love with her. As time passes, Isha falls in love with Vikrant too. While Vikrant's close friend Vilas Zende and his secretary Myra Karkhanis try to separate them because Myra also loves Vikrant. Somehow Vikrant manages to convince everyone and marries Isha.\nAfter the wedding, things start changing. The audience see a dark side of Vikrant. It is suddenly revealed that Vikrant is doing this for a property because his late father Dadasaheb states in his will that Rajnandini (Vikrant's ex-wife) is the real owner of the property. He tries to pretend that Isha is a rebirth of his past wife Rajnandini so that his mother, Aaisaheb and his brother, Jaydeep would give their property to Isha. Following his plan, Vikrant suggests Isha to join their office (because Rajnandini worked in the office as well). After some days, Isha finds fraud in the company and she finds the fraudster's name to be Gajendra \"Gaja\" Raghu Patil and soon she discovers that Vikrant is the criminal and Aaisaheb is the stepmother and Jaydeep is the stepbrother of Rajnandini. Also, she discovers that she is Rajnandini (reborn) and the story goes in flashback. In the flashback, we see that Gaja and Zende were close friends and living in a chawl. Gaja is educated but unemployed. Zende is a smart street boy and can easily fool everyone. One day, as he is rushing to give interview, he meets Rajnandini in an auto rickshaw who deeply falls in love with him and refers him to the owner of that company. Gaja marries Rajnandini so he can get all the property of Saranjame via Rajnandini. Her father Dadasaheb understands Gaja's true face and tries to stop him. Gaja eventually gets to know he has been exposed and kills Dadasaheb by giving him poison. After a few days, Rajnandini gets the evidence to prove that Gaja is a fraud. She tries to expose him but Gaja kills her too by pushing her off the balcony.\nThe story returns to the present. Isha decides to take revenge from Vikrant, but now she is confused because Vikrant truly loves Isha but did not love Rajnandini at all. Meanwhile, Vikrant kills Zende. Later, Isha happens to be pregnant but is actually not. Finally, Isha exposes Vikrant in front of her parents, Aaisaheb, Jaydeep, his wife, Soniya and Myra. When Vikrant comes to know that he is exposed, he commits suicide from the same balcony where he pushed Rajnandini as he is unable to deal with the guilt.\nProduction.\nThe series premiered on 13 August 2018 from Monday to Saturday at 8.30 pm by replacing \"Tuza Maza Breakup\"."}

It is the northernmost state in the country. The state surrounds Hkakabo Razi, the highest mountain of Myanmar, with an elevation of 5,881 above sea level. This along with Shan State, Sagaing State, and Chin State are the only states in Myanmar with snowfall. This is also the only state in Myanmar with blizzards, and high mountains which are above 5,000 above sea level. The capital of Kachin State is Myitkyina.\nHistory.\nKachin people was based on shifting hill agriculture. After the Sino-Burmese War, the Chinese exercised a degree of control over the present day Kachin State. During the British colonization of Myanmar, the Kachin Hills tribes autonomy was accepted by the government of the United Kingdom. The pre-independence government under Aung San reached the Panglong Aggrement with the Shan, Kachin, and Chin peoples on February 12,1947. Kachin State was formed in the same year out of the former British Burma civil districts of Bhamo and Myitkyina, together with the northern district of Puta-o. The state was officialy announced on 10 January 1948 and Mungdaw Masat Masat Manau for 3 days since January 9 to 11,1962.\nGeography.\nKachin State was bordered by India to the west, and China to the north and east. Most of the hills and all the mountains of Myanmar are in Kachin State. It lies north latitude between 23\u00b027N to 28\u00b025N latitude, 96\u00b00 and 98\u00b044 longhitude. The highest mountain of Myanmar, Hkakabo Razi, was also in the Kachin State.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Kachin State was agricultural. The main products of it was rice, teak, sucar cane, and opium, the minerals include gold and jade.\nPopulation.\nAs of 2014, Kachin State population is 1,689,441.\nReligion.\nThe dominant religion of the Kachin State in northern Myanmar is Theravada Buddhism, which is practiced by 64% of the Kachin people, followed by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism."}

It is an amusing as well as scary creature described by a mother's imagination to her child, to stop his cry. Etymologically, \"Tapta\" is made of two words, \"Tap\" (sound of water drops falling on the ground) and \"Ta\" (literally meaning \"to fall\") in Meitei (Manipuri). \nOnce there was a child who never stopped crying.\nOne night, when it was raining heavily, a thief came to steal a horse from the house of the child and a tiger also came to prey on one of the horses from the same place. As the two criminals were silently waiting a right time for their chances in the dark corners of the horse-stable, they heard the mother (\"father\" in another version) telling her child about many scary creatures, like the elephant, the horse, the lion and the tiger coming, to pacify his crying but it was of no use to the child.\nAnd the non-stop weeping child suddenly remained silent when the mother mentioned the name \"Tapta\". So, both the thief and the tiger believed that \"Tapta\" might surely be a dangerous creature. In the darkness, the thief started searching for the horses in the horse-stable. And as he was touching things one by one in the darkness, it coincided that he held the legs of the hiding tiger, thinking it as one of the horses in the stable. And the tiger thought that the person holding him would be none other than the so called \"Tapta\". And so, the ferocious tiger behaved like an obedient pet animal, fearing of the \"Tapta\". In the darkness of the stable, the thief prepared reins and saddles on the tiger (\"false horse\") and drove him away towards the woods. Again in the darkness of the woods, the tiger still believed that the person riding on and driving him was the so called \"Tapta\". And during the dawn, when there was abundant light, the thief recognised that the creature he had stolen was not a horse but a tiger. So, he tried to escape himself from the driving beast but the tiger never stopped running. \nThe thief saw a branch of a tree on the way the tiger was running. And with intelligent and quick steps, he jumped on the branch leaving the tiger alone running. A few moments later, the tiger realised the absence of the \"Tapta\" (actually, the thief) from his back. So, he thought that \"Tapta\" might even be able to fly on the air, that was how he was gone from him. So, on his way back to home, the tiger met many other animals, including a bear, an elephant, a fox and even another tiger (variable according to different versions of the story), to whom he narrated all the incidents. All these animals did not trust him and asked him to take them to the spot where the \"Tapta\" had freed him. On the other hand, the thief hid himself on a \"tree hole\" (\"tree hollow\") of the same tree, on whose branch he had jumped on. As the animals led by the tiger came to the spot, the tiger told them that the very spot was nearby the tree with a hole (where the thief was hiding). So, in searching for the \"Tapta\", they met many unlucky circumstances, leading them to believe in what the tiger had said to be correct. For example, when the bear inserted his small tail to the tree hollow, the thief pulled it inwards with his full strength and let it go off, that the bear fell on the ground. When the elephant inserted his trunk into the tree hollow, the thief hurted it with something (probably with a stick) so hard that the elephant yelled with pain. Finally, all of these animals approached to the lion, His Highness of the forest, and narrated all the incidents. So, the lion decided to check out the matter by Himself. Meanwhile, the thief had escaped and ran away for safety. And as the lion arrived, there was no one at that place. But the other animals still believe that there is a dangerous creature called the \"Tapta\"."}

Scientists think that the chemicals this frog makes in its skin have many uses.\nAppearance and behavior.\nThe adult male frog is 6.9 to 8.9 cm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 8.3 to 9.7 cm long. It has a short nose for a frog. It has circular teeth in its jaws. Its eyes are gray. Its pupils go up and down and open side to side like a cat's. It has disks on its toes for climbing, but they are small. It does not have webbed feet. Its skin is light brown to bright green in color and wrinkled. Sometimes this frog has white stripes on its belly and jaw.\nThis frog does not hop. It walks. It has an opposable thumb for holding on to branches and twigs, so it moves through the trees the way a monkey or lemur does.\nBecause this frog lives in trees instead of on the ground, it can dry out. The frog makes wax in its skin and spreads the wax all over its body with its feet. This makes it harder for water to leave the frog's body through the skin. This way, the frog can sit in the sun to warm up and it will not dry out\nScientists are not sure what this frog eats.\nBreeding.\nThe frogs build nests in trees over bodies of water. The frogs fold leaves into nests. The female lays 200 to more than 800 eggs at a time. The frogs put jelly over the eggs. This stops the eggs from drying out. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water.\nThreats.\nThis frog is not endangered but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where they live, because of not enough rain, because chemicals used to kill pests kill the frogs too, and because human beings catch them to sell as pets. There are no international laws against having a painted-belly leaf frog as a pet.\nScience.\nThis frog makes a chemicals in its skin. The chemicals are toxins, or poisons. When another animal tries to eat the frog, it gets the poison in its mouth. Scientists think humans could use some of these chemicals to kill dangerous microbes. Phylloseptin-1 is one of the chemicals that the frog makes. Scientists studied Phylloseptin-1 and saw it could kill \"Staphylococcus aureus\" bacteria, even after the bacteria had built a biofilm to protect themselves. Another chemical, Phylloseptin-S, can kill parasites, for example \"Leishmania infantum\", \"Leishmania braziliensis\", and \"Leishmania major\". The chemical Sauvagine is already used in medicine because it works very much like urotensin I, which can help human hearts and help the chemicals in the human body work well."}

In 1888, he proposed a meeting between German and French mathematicians and later, between 1894 and 1896, he contacted several great mathematicians proposing an international conference. He had the support of Felix Klein, Heinrich Weber, \u00c9mile Lemoine and others. Cantor proposed that a trial conference be held in 1897, either in Switzerland or in Belgium. He realized that neutral options were needed for French and German mathematicians to attend. He proposed that the first real conference take place in Paris in 1900. It quickly became evident that of the two options, Switzerland or Belgium, Switzerland was privileged because of its international reputation. The German Mathematical Society and the French Mathematical Society endorsed these ideas and agreed to contact Carl Geiser in Zurich. The 1897 congress was so successful that, rather than seeing it as a trial congress, it became the first international congress of mathematicians. It should be noted that the regulations enacted during this congress were the guiding principles of the following congresses and still influence the style of the congresses today."}

Perrot, Moritz Cantor and Darboux spoke successively with much applauded toasts.\nThe delegates were received on August 10 by the President of the French Republic, \u00c9mile Loubet, and on August 11, along with their colleagues from the Physics Congress, by Prince Roland Bonaparte, whose generous dedication to scientific enterprises is known.\nFinally, after the close of the Congress, its members gathered in large numbers on August 12, at noon, for a farewell banquet that many ladies and young girls were kind enough to honor and charm with their presence. The President of the Congress unfortunately found himself too tired to participate. Many toasts were raised, first by Darboux, who excused Henri Poincar\u00e9, then by Carl Friedrich Geiser, on behalf of the foreign delegates, by Jules Tannery who proposed the health of those absent, and by Cyparissos Stephanos and Nikol\u00e1i Vas\u00edliev; Darboux, finally, spoke again in his own name, and improvised a charming speech, in which he underlined how close it is that mathematicians must feel, since there are no scientists whose work is more disinterested, nor less likely to conquer the masses of the laity.\nSome members of the Congress met in the evening at the Opera, during a gala evening for which the Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts, Georges Leygues, reserved a few places for members of the Congress of the International Congress of Mathematicians.\nHilbert's Problems.\nIn many ways, it was David Hilbert's lecture on Hilbert's Problems in Mathematics the most famous lecture given at an International Congress of Mathematicians. It is sometimes described as a plenary conference and sometimes not. This is because Hilbert was invited to give a plenary lecture at the 1900 Congress. He couldn't decide on a topic and discussed what he should talk about with Hermann Minkowski and Adolf Hurwitz. Eventually he decided to discuss some outstanding math problems, but took a long time to write his lecture. The 1900 Congress program was released before it was ready, so his speech was not advertised as a plenary conference. It was delivered in Congress during a joint session of the Education Section and the History Section (due to lack of time Hilbert only spoke about 10 of his 23 issues in the conference, although all 23 problems appear in the published). It was on August 8, at 9:00 a.m. when David Hilbert gave his conference. It was titled On Future Problems in Mathematics.\nBy the time the Conference Proceedings appeared, the organizers decided that, because of its importance, they would put Hilbert's article in the section with plenary lectures. Another point worth noting is that Most of this congress was in French, but there was a discussion of math problems published in so many languages.\nRight after Hilbert's exposition, Giuseppe Peano said that Alessandro Padoa's subsequent communication would address Hilbert's issue no. 2. Rudolf Mehmke recalls that he proposed certain monographic representations in space from which a solution of the general equation of the seventh degree could result."}

Sometimes people see young variable oystercatchers and think they are South Island pied oystercatchers, but adult variable oystercatchers are too big.\nFood.\nVariable oystercatchers eat molluscs, worms, and crustaceans, but they like two-shelled molluscs the most. They can put their bill inside the crack between the two shells and then twist until it opens. Sometimes red-billed gulls take the variable oystercatcher's food.\nBreeding.\nVariable oystercatchers sometimes choose one partner for their whole life. Sometimes a pair will stay in the same place where they build nests all year, and sometimes they will fly with flocks for part of the year. Both the male and female variable oystercatcher sit on the egg. The egg takes 28 days to hatch. The chick can fly after 6-7 weeks.\nThreats.\nHuman beings killed this oystercatcher for food. Its population was lowest in about 1922, when people decided to stop hunting the bird. There were 2000 birds alive in the 1970s, 4000 in the 1990s and probably 5000 to 6000 alive today.\nNew Zealand does not have laws protecting the variable oystercatcher. However, variable oystercatchers build nests in the same places as the fairy terns and New Zealand dotterels, which are protected."}

This is mostly due to the views these societies have about gender and sexuality. Other behaviours that can often be found include victim blaming and sexual objectification. People in these societies may trivialize rape, or they say that it isn't much of a problem. They also often deny the fact that sexual violence is causing harm to the the victim. Very often, there is a combination of all these issues.\nThe term rape culture has also been used for other settings, or to describe the behavior of specific groups of people: Examples of these are people being raped in prison, or using rape in a war, as a form of psychological warfare. \nThat way, entire societies have been called rape cultures.\nSome people also have sexual fantasies about raping someone, or being raped; in that context, their ideas may be seen as part of pornography. \nSecond-wave feminists first had the idea of 'rape culture', in the 1970s. Most of them came from the United States. \nCritics of the concept say that it doesn't exist or is not widespread. They also say that even if there may be societies where rape is common, the concept of 'rape culture' implies that the person who rapes is not at fault; rather it is the society that made the rape possible. \nThere are many movements who have addressed the idea of rape culture. They include movements such as SlutWalk and Me Too. Tatiana Burke, an American activist started Me Too, after she was sexually assaulted in 2006. Some of these movements have developed into self-help groups, where victims can talk about their experiences, and help each other."}
