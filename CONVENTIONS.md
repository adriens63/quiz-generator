# Alignment conventions



## Lign breaks :
A single line between each party within the same function, 
two lines between functions within the same class, 
three lines between classes or independent functions. 



## Capitals :
Capital-letter constants, 
function and variables in snake_case, 
class and exceptions in CamelCase.



## Spaces :
A space between operations: 3 + 2, 
and after the commas.



## Presentation of functions:
Type-hint added this way, 
``` 
def __init__(self, k:int) -> None:
        pass
``` 
description of the function just after the def in double quotes, not with # in the middle in "clean" versions, 
single quotes instead of double quotes for strings.
