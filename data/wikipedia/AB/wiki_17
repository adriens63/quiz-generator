It began when Upper and Lower Egypt were joined as a single country, probably by Narmer. It is the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. At this time Thinis was the centre of power.\nHistorians argue about the dates of the First Dynasty which was part of the Early Bronze Age. They use a number of different ways to decide on the dates for events in Egypt. It began sometime between 3400 and 3000 BC. In 2013 radiocarbon dating showed that Hor-Aha began ruling between 3218\u20133035 BC.\nRulers.\nKnown rulers of the First Dynasty:\nInformation about the First Dynasty comes from monuments and other objects with royal names. The most important are the Narmer palette, the Narmer Macehead and the Den and Qa'a king lists. No details of the dynasty have been found except for brief entry on the Palermo Stone. Manetho's book, \"Aegyptiaca\" is different to the archeological evidence and other historical records. Manetho names nine rulers of the First Dynasty, but only one name matches the other sources. He only has information for four of them. The hieroglyphs were fully developed and would be used with little change for more than 3000 years.\nLarge tombs for pharaohs have been found at Abydos and Naqada. There are also cemeteries at Saqqara and Helwan near Memphis. These had buildings of wood and mud bricks, with some small use of stone for walls and floors. Stone was used for making ornaments, vessels, and sometimes for statues. Tamarix \u2013 tamarisk, salt cedar was used to build boats such as the Abydos Boats. They invented the \ufb01xed Mortise and tenon joint. A \ufb01xed tenon was made by shaping the end of one timber to \ufb01t into a mortise (hole) that is cut into a second timber. A variation of this joint, using a free tenon, became one of the most important features in Mediterranean and Egyptian shipbuilding. It joined two pieces of wood by putting a separate tenon into a hole (mortise) of the same size cut into each piece.\nHuman sacrifice.\nHuman sacrifice was part of the burials for all the pharaohs of the First Dynasty. Servants were buried near each pharaoh's tomb, as well as animals. There are 338 people buried at the tomb of Djer. The people and animals sacrificed, such as donkeys, would help the pharaoh in the afterlife. For unknown reasons, this practice ended with this dynasty. Later burials had shabtis (small figures like dolls) taking the place of actual people."}
{"id": "505426", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505426", "title": "Manetho", "text": "Manetho was an ancient Egyptian historian and priest from Sebennytos. He lived during the Ptolemaic era, in about 300 BC.\nManetho wrote the \"Aegyptiaca\" (\"History of Egypt\"). His book is used by Egyptologists to work out the dates for events in ancient Egypt. The earliest reference to Manetho's \"Aegyptiaca\" is in Jewish historian Josephus's book, \"Against Apion\".\nName.\nWe do not know what Manetho's name means, some suggestions are \"Gift of Thoth\", \"Beloved of Thoth\", \"Truth of Thoth\", \"Beloved of Neith\", or \"Lover of Neith\", \"Myinyu-heter\" (\"Horseherd\" or \"Groom\") and \"Ma'ani-Djehuti\" (\"I have seen Thoth\").\nLife and work.\nWe do not know when he was born or died. His book may have been written during the rule of Ptolemy I Soter (323\u2013283 BC) and Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285\u2013246 BC). The \"Hibeh Papyri\", dated to 241/40 BC, suggests he may been writing during the rule of Ptolemy III Euergetes (246\u2013222 BC). He wrote in the Greek language. Other works he wrote include \"Against Herodotus\", \"The Sacred Book\", \"On Antiquity and Religion\", \"On Festivals\", \"On the Preparation of Kyphi\", and the \"Digest of Physics\". The \"Book of Sothis\" on astrology, may also be written by him.\nHe was probably a priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis. He knew a lot about the cult of Sarapis based on Osiris and Apis. Sarapis was a Greco-Macedonian version of the Egyptian cult dating back to Alexander the Great. Tacitus and Plutarch wrote that Ptolemy (probably Ptolemy Soter) imported a statue of the god.\n\"Aegyptiaca\".\nThe \"Aegyptiaca\", the \"History of Egypt\", may have been Manetho's largest work. It was in date order and divided into three volumes. In \"Aegyptiaca\", he invented the word \"dynasty\" to mean a group of kings with a common origin. It came from the Greek word \"dynasteia\", meaning \"governmental power\". He was the first person to group the rulers into dynasties. He did not use the word to mean families. He began a new dynasty when there was a break or change in the power of government. For example, there was a break between the Fourth Dynasty in Memphis, and the Fifth Dynasty at Elephantine. He included details of many of the kings.\n\"Aegyptiaca\" may have been written as an Egyptian history, to be more accurate than Herodotus' \"Histories\". Hiis other book, \"Against Herodotus\", may be just have been a short version of \"Aegyptiaca\". There are no original copies of either book.\nCopies of the book.\n\"Aegyptiaca\" has not survived as a complete book. It is very possible that what has been kept was rewritten by other writers to support their Egyptian, Jewish, or Greek histories. This makes it difficult for modern historians to know how reliable it is as a history.\nThe earliest mention of Manetho is in Josephus' \"Contra Apionem\" (\"Against Apion\"). This was written nearly 400 years after \"Aegyptiaca\". It is clear that Josephus did not have the original of Manethos' book. At about the same time, a short version, the Epitome, of the book was being used. This kept Manetho's brief list of dynasties and a some parts that were seen as important. For example, it had that the first Dynasty, Menes, \"was snatched and killed by a hippopotamus\". It is not known if any of the short version is Manetho's original writing. Copies were written by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius of Caesarea. Eusebius's copy was used by Jerome in his Latin translation, an Armenian translation, and by George Syncellus. Syncellus saw that the copies by Eusebius and Africanus were almost the same, so he placed them side by side in his work, \"Ecloga Chronographica\".\nThese last four copies are the only copies of the epitome of Manetho. Other sections are in Malalas's \"Chronographia\" and \"Excerpta Latina Barbari\" (\"Excerpts in Bad Latin\").\nSources and methods.\nManetho used lists of kings to provide a structure for his history. Josephus wrote that Manetho also used stories, myths and legends for his book. This was common among historians of that time. He must have known the Greek work of Herodotus. He tried to link Egyptian history with Greek history. For example, he links King Memnon with Amenophis, and Armesis with Danaos). It is possible that these links may have been the work of later writers. We do know he could write in the Greek language.\nKing lists.\nThe king-list that Manetho used is unknown. The Turin King List is the one that is the most similar. The oldest source to compare with Manetho are the \"Old Kingdom Annals\" (c. 2500-2200 BC). There are also the Karnak king list, two at Abydos and the Saqqara list.\nThe \"Old Kingdom Annals\" only survive on the Palermo Stone. There are many differences between the stone and Manetho. The stone stops at the fifth dynasty. It includes the early kings of Lower Egypt and kings of Upper Egypt. Manetho lists several Greek and Egyptian gods beginning with Hephaistos and Helios. The \"Annals\" also give annual reports of the activities of the kings.\nThe New Kingdom lists left out some rulers. The list prepared for Seti I, has 76 kings from the First Dynasties to the Fourteenth, but leave out the Hyksos rulers and those linked to Akhenaten. The Saqqara list also does not include them in its list of 58 names. These names were left out for religious, rather than political reasons. If Manetho used these lists at all, he would have been unable to get all of his information from them.\nThe Turin King List was probably a government, rather than a religious document. It would not have needed to leave out kings for religious reasons. These sort of documents must have been available to Manetho. As a priest he would have had access to all written materials in the temple.\nManetho's list was probably from Lower Egypt. He included kings from the Third Intermediate Period, even such short-lived kings like Amenemnisu (5 years) and Osochor (6 years). But he left out the kings from Thebes, such as Osorkon III, Takelot III, Harsiese A and Pinedjem I and kings from Middle Egypt like Peftjaubast of Herakleopolis. Manetho's information must have come from a local city's temple library in the River Nile Delta. The Middle and Upper Egyptian Pharaohs did not control this part of the Delta; which is why they are left out of Manetho's king-list.\nNames.\nBy the Middle Kingdom, Egyptian kings each had five different names. These were the \"Horus\" name; the \"Two Ladies\" name; the \"Gold Horus\" name; the \"praenomen\" or \"throne name\"; and a \"nomen\", the personal name given at birth (also called a \"Son of Ra\" name as it was preceded by \"Sa Re'\"). Some Pharaohs also had more than one of these names. For example, Ramesses II used six Horus names at various times. We do not know if Manetho knew about the different names of rulers long past. Not all the different names for each king have been discovered, and it maybe that the kings were known by other names as well as the official names. Because Manetho translated the names into Greek, we do not know the original Egyptian name.\nContent.\nVolume 1 begins from the earliest times. It lists gods and demigods as kings of Egypt. Stories of Isis, Osiris, Set, or Horus might have been found here. The book then lists kings from the First Dynasty I to the Eleventh Dynasty. This would have included the Old Kingdom, the First Intermediate Period, and the early Middle Kingdom.\nVolume 2 covers Twelfth Dynasty to the Nineteenth. This includes the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period (XV\u2013XVII\u2014the Hyksos invasion), and the start of the New Kingdom. Josephus believed the Hyksos or \"shepherd-kings\" were the ancient Israelites who made their way out of Egypt (\"Apion\" 1.82\u201392).\nVolume 3 starts with the Twentieth Dynasty and ends with the Thirtieth.\nEffect of \"Aegyptiaca\".\nEgyptologists still use Manetho's way of grouping the pharaohs into dynasties. The French explorer and Egyptologist, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, had a copy of Manetho's lists to help him read the hieroglyphs. Modern histories now use both the modern translation of names and Manetho's version."}

She was bringing pitchers of water to men working a cannon. When one of the men fell down, she fired the cannon herself.\nHistorians do not think there was a real person named \"Molly Pitcher\" in the Revolutionary War. Most historians agree it was a nickname. They think the story of Molly Pitcher may have come from more than one real woman who fired a cannon. Many of the battles were fought on hot days, and soldiers would ask for a pitcher of water to drink or to cool the cannons. Molly was a common woman's nickname at the time.\nHistory of the legend.\nStories about the American Revolution were first told by talking out loud instead of writing them down. This allowed the storyteller to make things sound bigger than they were or even make up things that did not happen at all. Some stories are still told, long after professional historians prove they are not true. \nThe story of Molly Pitcher may have come from more than one real person. Many women helped soldiers on the battlefields during the Revolutionary war. Most were wives and daughters of soldiers. According to the legend, \"Molly Pitcher\" brought water to a group of soldiers firing a cannon during a battle. One of those soldiers was her husband. She brought water many times. When she came to bring water one time, she saw her husband had been shot. Molly took his place and helped fire the cannon. The Battle of Monmouth is probably where the legend started. \nHer story was started many years after the war by writers and artists. A Currier and Ives print of a \"Captain Molly\" appeared in 1848. The first writing about Molly Pitcher was in 1859. It wasn't until 1876 that someone published a genealogy claiming a local woman was the real Molly Pitcher. After that, the idea of Molly Pitcher grew and grew.\nToday, Molly Pitcher is famous. She is in grade-school and high-school textbooks. Internet sources even argue whether Molly Pitcher was a feminist.\nThe real women.\nMost legends start with some small truth. Molly Pitcher is no exception. There are several women who might have been the real Molly Pitcher, or it might have been all of them together:\nThe Revolutionary war had many small fights and only a few large battles. It was not unusual for women to be fight. Women filled many roles that most people thought were only done by men.\nA written account.\nJoseph Plumb Martin was a soldier in the Continental Army. He wrote down of his experiences. This came to the attention of historians in the 1950s. Martin describes a woman at the Battle of Monmouth:\n This account has been changed in other sources to show he gave her a name when in fact he did not."}

It is awarded to service members who achieve an above-average score on a weapons qualification course. Also, there are select State National Guard organizations that award marksmanship ribbons for high placement in state-level marksmanship competitions.\nNavy.\nThe U.S. Navy has issued two marksmanship ribbons: the \"Navy Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon\" and \"Navy Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon\", since 1920. The pistol ribbon is awarded for qualification on the Beretta M9 9mm pistol. The rifle ribbon is awarded for qualification on the M14 and M16 rifle variants.\nThe Navy issues the marksmanship ribbon in three levels\u00a0\u2014 that of Marksman, Sharpshooter, and Expert. The basic ribbon is awarded for the Marksman level. The specific Marksmanship Device is awarded for qualification as a Sharpshooter or Expert. Those receiving an Expert qualification receive the Marksmanship Medal in addition to the Marksmanship Ribbon.\nBetween 1942 and 1960, the Navy also issued ribbons known as the Distinguished Marksmanship Ribbons. These awards were declared obsolete by 1965.\nAir Force.\nThe United States Air Force awards a single ribbon, known as the \"Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon\". It is for expert qualification on either the M-16 rifle, M-4 carbine or the individuals AFSC's (duty) designated pistol. The ribbon is issued in only one degree. But, a bronze service star may be worn on the ribbon for those who have qualified expert on both the service rifle and pistol. The ribbon was authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force on Aug. 28, 1962. It was awarded to all Air Force service members who qualified after Jan. 1, 1963. Prior to the ribbon, Air Force members were awarded with the United States Air Force Small Arms Marksmanship Certificate of Achievement (AF Form 1193 Jan 1961).\nCoast Guard.\nThe Coast Guard Marksmanship Ribbons are issued under the same criteria as the U.S. Navy. But Coast Guardsmen use a .40 cal SIG Sauer P229R DAK pistol instead of the Navy's M9 pistol. The Coast Guard issues two ribbons. they are known as the \"Coast Guard Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon\" and the \"Coast Guard Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon\". The Marksmanship Device is awarded for qualification at the higher levels of sharpshooter and expert. Like the Navy, for those who receive an expert qualification, the Marksmanship Medal is awarded instead of the Marksmanship Ribbon.\nNational Guard.\nOnce a year, thousands of Army and Air National Guard shooters (champion marksmanship teams from each state) compete against each other at the Winston P. Wilson Rifle and Pistol Championships. In the Missouri National Guard, the top twelve guardsmen selected to represent their state at the Winston P. Wilson matches are awarded the Governor's Twelve Ribbon. This is worn on dress uniforms. Any guardsman who earns the award more than once wear Hawthorn Cluster Device(s) on top of the ribbon. In addition, these guardsman are awarded the Governor's Twelve Tab for wear on the combat uniform.\nSimilarly, the Adjutant General of Missouri awards the Adjutant General's Twenty Ribbon to soldiers and airmen. It is awarded to those who qualify among the top twenty competitors at the Missouri State Combat Matches conducted each year. They are the top eight combat rifle shooters, the top eight pistol shooters, the top two light machine gun teams, and the top two scout/sniper teams. In addition to this ribbon, these guardsman are also awarded the Adjutant General's Twenty Combat Badge for wear on the combat uniform.\nGuardsmen are authorized to wear these ribbons as a permanent decoration on service dress uniforms, to the left of federal awards, when operating under Title 32 (state control) status. When federalized (Title 10), guardsman cannot wear these ribbons until they return to Title 32 status.\nAdditional Information.\nThe U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps provide Weapons Qualification Badges instead of a Marksmanship Ribbon. For the services that award the Marksmanship Ribbon, re-qualification is not necessary once a service member has obtained the award. The ribbon may be worn throughout an individual's career. In the Navy and Coast Guard, the Marksmanship Ribbon may be upgraded with a Marksmanship Device if a higher qualification is achieved."}

He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War as a double agent. He served under the Marquis de Lafayette. He reported on the activities of Benedict Arnold after he had gone over to the British. He also reported on Lord Cornwallis just before the Battle of Yorktown. James gave the British false information on the Americans.\nLife and career.\nHe was an African-American slave. He was owned by William Armistead of Virginia. James took his master's name and called himself James Armistead. James was born about 1748 in Virginia.During that time, the British had destroyed Richmond, Virginia. He lived in New Kent (36 minutes away from Richmond), which made him want to join even more.\nAfter getting the consent of his master, he volunteered in 1781 to join the American army under the Marquis de Lafayette. The Marquis used him as a spy. Armistead posed as a runaway slave to the British. He joined the camp of Brigadier General Benedict Arnold the turncoat who was leading some British forces in the area. Pretending to be a spy for the British, Armistead gained Arnold's trust. Arnold used him to guide British troops through local roads. \"The ex-slave, who later renamed himself James Armistead Lafayette in the general's honor, served as a double agent against the british under the avowedly antislavery Lafayette.\" \nAfter Arnold departed north in the spring of 1781, James went to the camp of Lord Charles Cornwallis. Again he posed as a runaway slave. He was given a job serving General Cornwallis. He moved frequently between British camps. In each case the officers would speak openly about their strategies in front of him. James kept this information in written reports. He gave these reports to other American spies. In this way he relayed much information about the British plans for troop movements and about their weapons. Cornwallis hired James to spy for the British. When he was sent to spy on the Americans he brought back an order for General Daniel Morgan to bring up all his reserves. Morgan didn't have any reserves, it was a false order. But it kept Cornwallis where he was leading to his defeat at the Battle of Yorktown. The intelligence reports from his espionage were also instrumental in helping to defeat the British.\nAfter the war.\nAfter the war James had to return to his live as a slave. He was not eligible for emancipation under the Act of 1783 for slave-soldiers. Spies were not considered soldiers. When Lafayette returned to Virginia in 1784 he found out that James was still a slave. \nThe Marquis de Lafayette wrote a letter to the Virginia legislature praising James and what he did.The quote said, \u201cThis is to certify that the bearer by the name of James has done essential services to me while I had the honour to command in this state. His intelligences from the enemy\u2019s camp were industriously collected and faithfully delivered. He perfectly acquitted himself with some important commissions I gave him and appears to me entitled to every reward his situation can admit of.\u201d -Lafayette. This won James his freedom and a pension. James took the name James Armistead Lafayette.\nJames, now James Armistead Lafayette, bought forty acres of land in Virginia and began farming. He married and had a large family. He died August 9, 1830 on his farm in New Kent County, Virginia."}

It is part of an organism's phenotype.\nEvery living thing, from tiny organisms like bacteria, to plants, animals and humans, has some characteristics which make it special. Thus an elephant has tusks, large size and weight, large ears and very large molar teeth (et cetera). These are typical characters of the African and Indian elephants.\nBiologists call those \"traits\". The living thing is built in a certain way; this is its \"anatomy\", its structure or body. The physical structure \"works\" in a certain way; this is its function, the way its body works. An animal also \"acts\" in a certain way; this is its behavior.\nThe way that a living thing is structured, the way its body works and the way that it acts are all traits. The basic traits are shared by all the members of the group, \"that is why they are put in the same group\". Other traits are only shared by a small number of the group.\nFor example: \nTraits are heritable: they can be passed on from one generation to the next by genes. Mendel's work involved the inheritance of traits on pea plants. The whole group of traits of an organism is its phenotype.\nTrait versus character.\nDifferent sources use the term differently. 'Trait' competes with the term 'character'.\nSynonyms.\nAccording to some authorities, trait and character are synonyms:\n'Trait' as a sub-character.\nSome sources use both terms:\nThis works well with Mendelian characters. In such cases, a character is a feature of a species which may present as various traits. Examples:\nBut not all characters are inherited in the simple manner of Mendel's pea characters. For example, an animal's weight is a character, but many genes contribute to it, and so does the animal's environment from birth. Weight is a) continuous rather than discrete (separate steps), b) polygenic (controlled by a number of genes), and c) because weight is influenced by both heredity and environment.\nOnly 'character' used.\nTo avoid this issue, some sources use only the term character. Futuyma uses this system for Mendelian characters:\nThis use of 'character state' allows Futuyma to use terms such as 'ancestral state' and 'derived state' when talking about the evolution of characters."}

She says that the artist attempted to sabotage one of her concert tours by hiring people that worked for her (Swift). There are rumors from \"Rolling Stone\", \"Billboard\", \"Time\" and \"Washington Post\" that singer-songwriter Katy Perry is the subject of the song.

It also charted in January of 2015 as an album cut from \"1989\". It peaked at #78. After the music video premiere at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, the remixed song with Kendrick Lamar re-entered the chart at #53 and #26 on the Digital Songs Chart. It sold over 47,000 digital copies. The song hit #1 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the week ending May 24, 2015. It sold 385,000 copies. It became Taylor's fourth #1 single. It was also her third from \"1989\" (following \"Shake It Off\" and \"Blank Space\"). That made Taylor Swift the first artist since Adele to have three Hot 100 chart-toppers from the same record. It was also her fourth consecutive top-ten single from \"1989\".\nCritical reception.\nThe original album version of \"Bad Blood\" received mixed reviews from music critics. But, the remixed version of the song received mostly positive reviews. Much of the praise was for Lamar's guest verses and the reworked instrumental. George Seabrook, writing for \"The Edge\" in Southampton, England, gave the song four-and-a-half stars out of five. He praised the song for \"Lamar\u2019s simple, brutally effective verses\". He also said that Swift and Lamar made \"not just one more meaningless stunt collaboration, but a powerful new duo\".\nMusic video.\nThe music video was directed by renowned director Joseph Kahn, with Swift producing it. He had also directed the music video for \"Blank Space\". The video was shot in Los Angeles on April 12, 2015. The setting for the video is the City of London. The music video premiered on May 17, 2015, at the start of the Billboard Music Awards. Several friends of Swift are present in the music video, such as British singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding, American entertainer Selena Gomez, and American actresses Lena Dunham and Jessica Alba.

They cause diseases in birds and mammals, including humans. These diseases can be mild, or they can be fatal. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, for example rhinoviruses). More lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.\nThey are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome. The genome size of coronaviruses is about 26 to 32 kilobases, which is extraordinarily large for an RNA virus. There are four major groups of coronaviruses, called alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.\nThe most famous coronavirus is one of the betas, the kind that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.\nThe name \"coronavirus\" comes from the Latin word \"corona\", meaning \"crown\" or \"halo\", and refers to how virions look under an electron microscopy (E.M.). They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomer, which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect.\nProteins of coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N).\nDiseases.\nCoronaviruses infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds. Six different strains of coronaviruses infect humans. These include:\nCoronaviruses are believed to cause many common colds in human adults. The significance and economic impact of coronaviruses is hard to assess. Unlike rhinoviruses (another common cold virus), human coronaviruses are easy to grow in the laboratory.\nStructure.\nCoronaviruses are large, spherical particles with unique surface projections. Their size is variable, averageing 80 to 120 nms. The total molecular weight is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope studded with projecting protein molecules. These layers protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.\nThe viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored. The ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300. The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size. S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells. But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein. The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm.\nHistory.\nThe earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens happened in North America. Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. It was not realized at the time that three related viruses were involved.\nHuman coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960's using two different methods. E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrel, working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council, collected a unique common cold virus B814 in 1961. The virus could not be cultivated using the techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and other known common cold viruses. Eventually, this was solved. The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn. The isolated virus, when put into the noses of volunteers, caused a cold. The virus was inactivated by ether which showed it had a lipid envelope. The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether.\nScottish virologist June Almeida at St Thomas' Hospital, London, compared the structures of IBV, B814, and 229E in 1967. Using transmission electron microscopy,the three viruses were shown to be similar in shape and have club-like spikes. A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year isolated another member of this group of viruses. Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.\nThe IBV-like novel cold viruses looked like the mouse hepatitis virus. This new group of viruses were called \"coronaviruses\" from their crown-like appearance. The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present human coronavirus it was. Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003, HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. There have been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s."}

In the American army a matross ranked as a private of artillery. \nHistory.\nMatrosses were first used in the British Army in 1639. Before that they were called gunner's assistants. In the German language a matrose means a sailor. The work assigned to the matross was considered sailor's work on a ship. It was an effort to give the assistant a respectable title. But their pay rate remained the same. In 1873 all matrosses were promoted to the rank of gunner. The rank of matross was no longer used.\nA soldier's manual for artillery used by Americans in the Revolutionary war gave a detailed instruction for a matross. In part it said:\nBy the War of 1812 an ideal gun crew could be up to 15 men. Each man would have a specific task in the sequence of loading and firing the artillery piece. Often a non-commissioned officer would commanded the gun crew and aimed the gun. Like the other gun crew members, the matross had a specific place to stand as he performed his duties.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

He usually avoids guns or explosives, preferring dacoits, thuggee, and members of other secret societies as his agents. They use knives, or \"pythons and cobras\u00a0... fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli\u00a0... my black spiders\" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons.\nIn the earliest books, Fu Manchu is an agent of the secret society, the \"Si-Fan\". and is the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations of Western imperialists. In later books, he seeks control of the Si-Fan. The Si-Fan is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and white slavery. Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the \"elixir vitae\" (elixir of life), a formula he spent decades trying to perfect.\nFu Manchu is opposed by a typical English detective of the Sherlock Holmes type: Denis Nayland Smith. Fu Manchu's daughter, Fah Lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, plotting to usurp her father's position in the Si-Fan, and aiding his enemies within and outside of the organisation. Her real name is unknown; Fah lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment. She has been played by Anna May Wong, Myrna Loy, and several other actresses.\nCriticism.\nDr. Fu Manchu has been criticized as an overtly racist creation. A review in \"The Independent\", says \"These magnificently absurd books, glowing with a crazed exoticism, are really far less polar, less black-and-white, less white-and-yellow, than they first seem\".\nActors.\nActors who have played Fu Manchu in movies include Boris Karloff (once), Warner Oland (four times), and Christopher Lee (five times).\nActresses who played his daughter Fa Lo Suee include Myrna Loy and Anna May Wong, but most of all by Tsai Chin, who played the role five times in the 1960s. The character of Fa Lo Suee was usually renamed to a form which could be pronounced more easily.\nThe other female character who appears in several of the stories, and hence in some of the films, is Karamaneh, styled \"K\u00e2raman\u00e8h\".\nThe story-line is that she was sold to the Si-Fan by Egyptian slave traders while she was still a child. She appears in five novels of the series as a love interest."}

The Economic Policy Institute reported in 2014 that survey evidence suggests wage theft costs US workers billions of dollars a year. The rights violated by wage theft have been guaranteed to workers in the United States in the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\nIn February 2010 Miami-Dade County, Florida became the first jurisdiction in America to ban wage theft.

Steno argued that rock layers (or strata) are laid down in succession, and that each represents a \"slice\" of time.\nSteno formulated the principle of superposition. This says that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it. This principle is simple, but applying it to real rocks is complicated by their history. During the 18th century geologists realized that: \nThe first serious attempts to formulate a time scale of historical geology that could be applied anywhere on Earth happened in the late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts was led by Abraham Werner and others. They divided the rocks of the Earth's crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a period of Earth history. It was possible to speak of a \"Tertiary period\" as well as of \"Tertiary rocks\". Indeed, \"Tertiary\" (now Palaeocene-Pliocene) and \"Quaternary\" (now Pleistocene-Holocene) remained in use as names of geological periods well into the 21th century.\nWerner had the idea that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood. That is called the Neptunist theory. A major shift in thinking came when James Hutton read his \"Theory of the Earth; or, an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe\" before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March and April 1785. James Hutton in those reading became \"the founder of modern geology\". Hutton suggested the interior of the Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock. Land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory was called Plutonist in contrast to the flood-oriented theory.\nThe identification of strata by the fossils they contained was pioneered by William Smith, Georges Cuvier and others in the early 19th century. Geologists could divide Earth history more precisely. If two strata (however distant in space or different in composition) contained the same fossils, chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time. Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geological periods still used today. Cuvier thought many of the geological features of the Earth could be explained by catastrophic events which had caused the extinction of many species of animals. Over the course of his career, Cuvier came to believe there had not been a single catastrophe, but several, resulting in a succession of different faunas.\nBritish geologists were most active in the 19th century. The \"Cambrian,\" (the Roman name for Wales) and the \"Ordovician,\" and \"Silurian\", named after ancient Welsh tribes, were periods defined by Welsh rocks. The \"Devonian\" was named after the English county of Devon, and the name \"Carboniferous\" was simply an adaptation of \"the Coal Measures,\" the old British geologists' term for the same set of strata. The \"Permian\" was named after Perm, Russia, because it was defined using strata in that region by a Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison. British geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into eras and the subdivision of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods into epochs. In general, periods were named after places where the rocks were easy to see.\nGeologists and paleontologists based the geologic table on the relative positions of different strata and fossils. They estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various processes. They estimated weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and how long it took to turn sediment into hard rock. The discovery of radioactivity in 1896 and its geological applications by radiometric dating happened in the first half of the 20th century. It made possible the absolute dating of rocks, and the discovery of the age of the Earth.\nThe International Commission on Stratigraphy is working to define exactly when geologic periods start and finish, and where the best examples are. They are called Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSP)."}

In the United States, the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses close to the homes of people they wanted to intimidate. It is unrelated to a custom called fiery cross, which was common in Northern Europe. In that custom, a burning piece of wood was used in processions, or to call people together for a rebellion.\nAt first, Klans during the Reconstruction period did not burn crosses. The idea was introduced by Thomas Dixon Jr. in his novel, \"The Clansmen\". He took it from an old Scottish custom known as the \"Crann Tara,\" used to declare war. It also called all clan members to defend a certain area. Most of the KKK's rituals were Scottish in origin; the group saw Medieval Europe as morally pure and white. Ten years after Dixon's book, D.W. Griffith directed The Birth of a Nation, the movie version of Dixon's novel.\nCross burning in the KKK did not really start until the early 1900s. Its purpose \"was\" to intimidate, despite the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in 2003. The case was called Virginia v. Black. The state of Virginia passed a law saying that any cross burning would be taken as an attempt to intimidate a person/group of people. The Supreme Court decided that cross burning was not meant to intimidate, and was an act of free speech, ruling the law unconstiutional."}

Cats rub on the plant, roll on the ground, paw at it, lick it, and chew it. Some leap about and purr, some cry out. Cats do it for about five to fifteen minutes, after which olfactory fatigue usually sets in. \nThe nepetalactone in catnip acts as a feline attractant after it enters the cat's nose. At the olfactory epithelium, the nepetalactone binds to one or more olfactory receptors.\nThe catnip effect works on the whole cat family, not just on domestic cats.. Several tests showed that leopards, cougars, servals, and lynxes often reacted strongly to catnip in a manner similar to domestic cats. Lions and tigers may react strongly as well, but they don't react all the time.\nWith domestic cats, \"N. cataria\" is a recreational substance for pets to enjoy. Catnip and catnip-laced products are available to consumers. \nNot all cats are affected by catnip; roughly one third are not affected by the plant. The behavior is hereditary.\nSome other plants also have a similar effect on cats, include valerian (\"Valeriana officinalis\")."}

Along with posting content on Twitter and Facebook, he held an \"Ask Me Anything\" on Reddit on May 19, 2015.\nOn September 30, the Sanders campaign announced that it had reached 1 million individual donations, becoming the first in 2015 to reach that threshold.\nIn November 1, 2015, Sanders released his first campaign ad.\nDuring a December 27 appearance on \"Face the Nation\", Sanders criticized Donald Trump for stating in the fourth Republican debate that \"wages are too high\" and promised to win over working-class Trump supporters. The next day Trump tweeted that \"wages in are [sic] country are too low.\"\nSanders gained ground on Clinton in the spring of 2016.\nDNC Data Breach incident.\nIn December 2015, the Democratic National Committee suspended the campaign's access to its voter data, following the firing of a Sanders campaign staffer who allegedly viewed data from the campaign of Hillary Clinton as the result of a firewall failure, which he denies. The Sanders campaign criticized the move as an excessive reaction stemming from the inappropriate actions of a single staffer and threatened possible legal action unless the Democratic National Committee restores its access. The Sanders campaign claims it warned the DNC about glitches in the voter file program months ago. On December 18, 2015, the campaign filed a lawsuit, stating the Committee had unfairly suspended its access. Former Obama Advisor David Axelrod contended on Twitter that the DNC was \"putting finger on the scale\" for Hillary. The DNC and the Sanders campaign struck a deal the same day that restored the campaign's access to voter data.\nAdvertising.\nJust before the early primaries in 2016, Sanders published an advertisement called \"America\". It was first shown on January 21, on YouTube. It was set to be shown on television in Iowa and New Hampshire shortly before the Democratic Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. The advertisement features \"America\", a song by Simon &amp; Garfunkel from their album \"Bookends\" (1968).\nFundraising.\nSanders raised over $1.5 million in the first 24 hours after he announced his presidential campaign on April 30, 2015. This was greater than the amount raised by any of the Republican candidates in the first 24 hours after their respective announcements. By May 5, Sanders campaign had received approximately 75,000 contributions and had raised $3 million, with the average donation being $43. According to a campaign adviser, 99.4 percent of the donations were $250 or less, and 185,000 supporters had signed up on the campaign's website.\nEffect.\nWhen Sanders opened his campaign in June, his rallies were compared with those of Hillary Clinton. Sanders's campaign events have been drawing \"overflow crowds\" around the country. Sanders drew more than 700 supporters at a mid-June event in Iowa, which the \"Wall Street Journal\" noted as\n\u201cthe same number who went to a Hillary Clinton event on Sunday that featured a buffet table and a live band.\u201d A crowd of an estimated 3,000 attended an event in Minneapolis. Sanders said he was \"Stunned. Stunned. I mean I had to fight my way to get into the room. Standing room only. Minneapolis was literally beyond belief.\"\nOn August 8, Sanders drew a crowd of over 12,000 in Seattle, Washington. The rally took place in the basketball arena of the University of Washington, which was filled to capacity. Before the rally, Sanders spoke to an additional 3,000 supporters outside who could not get into the arena. Black Lives Matter activists had interrupted an earlier event and prevented Sanders from taking the podium. The rally in Seattle was part of a three-day West Coast tour.\nOn the following day, August 9, Sanders spoke to a record crowd of 20,000 supporters inside the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon. The event was again filled to capacity, with 8,000 supporters waiting in the overflow area provided by venue officials. The West Coast tour ended on August 10, with a large rally in Los Angeles, California. The event was filled to capacity, with Sanders' campaign claiming over 27,000 people turned out, breaking the record he set the day before. The rally included an introduction from comedian Sarah Silverman.\nAs of August 15, 2015, Sanders had partially consolidated Democratic opposition to Clinton's nomination but had not significantly affected the level of support for her. A mid-September CBS poll that included Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a presidential bid, showed Sanders leading Clinton 52 percent to Clinton's 30 percent in New Hampshire and 43 percent to Clinton's 33 percent in Iowa. In September and October 2015, latest polling show Sanders and Clinton are tied in polls.\nHis performances at the first two Democratic debates have received positive reviews. After his first debate, he won many endorsements even though his polls number as decreased compared to Clinton's rise in the polls. After the second debate, Sanders was thought to be the clear winner.\nSince polls closed on December 4, 2015, online votes showed that Sanders was in first place to become Time's 2015 Person of the Year with 10.4% of votes compared to second place holder Malala Yousafzai's 5.3%. On December 7, it announced Sanders won the reader's poll of the magazine, but will not be person of the year. On December 9, poll numbers showed that Sanders was leading Clinton in the New Hampshire polls by 50% to 40%. According to a public poll done by TIME magazine, Sanders won the third Democratic debate with 84% to Clinton's 13%.\nIn January 2016, weeks leading to the Democratic primaries, Sanders was leading New Hampshire by 50% to Clinton's 46% and in Iowa with 49% to 43%.\nPrimaries.\nOn February 1, 2016, Sanders lost the Iowa caucus to Clinton by less than 1%. On February 9, Sanders won the New Hampshire caucus by 22%. His victory was one of the largest in years. Sanders became the first democratic socialist and the first non-Christian to win a United States presidential primary for a major party. On February 20, 2016, Sanders lost the Nevada caucus by 5%. On February 27, 2016, Sanders lost the South Carolina caucus by almost 48%.\nOn March 1, 2016, \"Super Tuesday\", Sanders won four states: Vermont, Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota. He lost Massachusetts by less than 1%. He lost Alabama, American Samoa, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia during the event. On March 5, 2016, \"Super Saturday\", Sanders won two states: Kansas by 35% and Nebraska by almost 15%. He lost the Louisiana primary by about 48% during the event. On March 6, 2016, Sanders won the Maine caucuses by almost 65%. Since polls closed on March 8, Sanders has won all 36 international cities of the Democrats Abroad primary.

She is the only woman to have the job of prosecutor in the country. She has 15 years experience in the Afghan government. During the time of the Taliban, she was not permitted to work. Instead, she had an illegal school for girls in her house. In 2006, after the time of the Taliban, she worked as Chief Prosecutor General of Herat Province. In 2010, she had 87 cases; mostly about corruption and oppression of women.\nIn 2011, she received the International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State. \nLife.\nBashir was the oldest child in her family. She was a very good student. Her father encouraged her to study. When she graduated, she had to choose three subjects for graduate school. Her three choices were law, law, and law. The Minister for Higher Education approved her to study law. She got a law degree from Kabul University. Later she studied in Kabul for one year to be a prosecutor.\nIn 1996, after she graduated, Bashir got married. She moved to Herat, her husband's city. Her husband has an import business in China. Bashir has two sons and a daughter. The oldest son studies in Germany. The other two children study at home, because of death threats against Bashir and her family.\nWork.\nAfter Bashir finished school, she went to work at the Attorney General's office. She worked as a criminal investigator in Kabul, and later in Herat.\nAfter Bashir moved to Herat, in 1995, the Taliban came. They stopped women from working. Bashir stayed in the house, like the other women. The Taliban made it illegal for girls to read or work. This ensured that women and girls remained dependent on men. Bashir started an underground school in her house. The students hid their books inside shopping bags.\nIn 2001, the American invasion allowed women to start work again. Bashir went back to her old job as a criminal investigator. When the Attorney General visited Herat in 2006, he met with prosecutors from four provinces. Bashir was the only woman at the meeting. The Attorney General said he was happy with Bashir's murder case against the husband of Afghan poet and journalist Nadia Anjuman. The Attorney General made Bashir the Chief Prosecutor General of the province.\nThe new Afghan constitution.\nThe U.S. government welcomed Bashir as a sign of Westernization after the Taliban. The US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice flew Bashir to Washington for talks. However, Bashir said many negative things about the new constitution. The new constitution gave equal rights to women, but many judges still used the old Islamic Sharia Law. Bashir said the new law did not give women freedom to choose their husbands. She also said that men were not sent to trial for adultery, but women were stoned to death for the same thing. In divorce, the husband always got the children; women thought suicide was better. On the subject of corruption, Bashir wanted to stop appointments based on ethnic groups. She also wanted more money for officials. She said the corruption would not stop if the officials had to find more money somewhere."}

Twine is as useful as duct tape in that it can be used for a wide variety of repairs.\nUses.\nIn arts and crafts, twine is used for a wide variety of projects. It is used in knitting, crocheting, and making jewellery, to mention just a few. Commercially, twine is used in upholstery, rug-making, agriculture, the cotton industry, textiles, and in the carton industry.\nHistory.\nTwine traces its history back to as early as 32,000 years ago. Wild flax fibers were used to make twine for clothing, baskets and creating tools. Hunter-gatherers processed flax into strong cords or twine. \nArchaeologists discovered flax fiber cords in a western Asian cave that date from 32,000 to 26,000 years ago. In a cave at Lascaux, France fossilized remains of a \u201ctwo-ply laid rope of about 7 mm diameter\u201d were dated to about 15,000 BCE. Hemp twine was used from about 8,000 BCE. By 1,000 BCE hemp rope and twine was used by most civilizations. From 500 BCE to 1900 AD almost all rope and twine used in sailing ships was made from hemp. For example, the USS Constitution used hemp for its rigging lines. Sea bags and other common goods used help cordage or twine.\nIn the 1630s hemp was used to produce cordage in Boston. Soon there were several ropewalks in Boston producing hemp rope. Hemp twine was twisted into rope.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

In 1961 Carroll Shelby took a dated AC Ace sports car and installed a Ford V-8 engine with a Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed transmission. The resulting car made history. Designed as a Corvette-killer it was one of the fastest cars available at the time. They were produced and sold by Carroll Shelby International Inc. \nHistory.\nCarroll Shelby was one of the world's first professional race car drivers. At age 37 a bad heart forced his retirement from racing. He started building cars in the back of a tire dealership in Santa Fe Springs, California. In June 1962 he moved to Venice, California. He wanted to build an American sportscar. Others had experimented with putting an American engine into a European car body. Shelby thought he could do it better. He approached General Motors with the idea but they already had the Corvette. They were also not interested in a limited production sports car. Ford, however, was very interested. Shelby also learned that AC Limited in England was having trouble getting motors for their cars. He told them Ford was interested in supplying engines if they would ship him a car to test. They sent a body and Ford sent him a V-8. He and a friend worked all night installing the engine. In the morning they had the first Shelby AC Cobra.\nIn the beginning Shelby used Ford's 260 cu in. engine. The V8 worked so well within the spacious engine bay Shelby looked for a larger engine. In 1963 the 289 was installed and worked very well. In 1964 Shelby moved to Ford's 427 cu in. engine and made the chassis stronger in 1965.\nRacing.\nIn October 1962 a Cobra was winning at Riverside, California when a broken hub put it out of the race. In January 1963 a Cobra won at Riverside. Cobras raced at Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans. \nIn 1964 a specially designed 427 coupe won the GT Championship. The same year raced at Le Mans and placed fourth. Their legend continued to grow on the racetrack.\nProduction.\nFrom 1961 to 1968 a total of only 998 were built. Of these 655 were 289 Cobras and 343 were 427 Cobras. In late 1968 AC stopped production of the Ace body. They continued to produce AC Cobras for Shelby until 1968.\nShelby didn't make any more Cobras until the early 1990s. He watched as prices soared for his original cars. He also saw many Cobra replicas being built; some good, some not so good. He still had a number of unused chassis numbers for cars designed to be built in 1965. He wanted to sell them as new 1965 models but the state of California would only allow them to be sold for off-road use. He built only nine \"Completion Cobras\". Shelby then began to build cars as \"rollers\" that could be completed by an authorized dealer. They were available with a fiberglass body or the original aluminum body.

The mosque was built in the 15th century and then renovated in the 19th century. Its first exhibition was held in 1972. In 1992, after the collapse of the USSR, the museum was moved to the second floor of what is now the Baku Museum Center, a building that had originally been the Lenin museum. The collection was named in honour of the carpet designer Latif Karimov.\nPlans to move the collection to a new building have been in preparation since 2010 when Azerbaijani carpets were proclaimed \"a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage\" by UNESCO.\nThe new building was due to open in late 2012 and was visited by President Ilham Aliyev in September 2013, but as of March 2014 the new building had not yet officially opened its doors to the public. In April 2014 the museum was renamed Azerbaijan Carpet Museum dropping its much longer official title.\nCollection.\nThe collection of the museum includes over 10,000 items of ceramics, metal works of the 14th century, jewellery from the Bronze Age, carpets and carpet items from the 17th-20th centuries, national garments and embroidery, and applied art works (decorative arts and design) of the Modern Age. \nThe museum organizes public lectures, study courses on carpets and applied arts.\nIt has a book store selling books on Azerbaijani crafts and carpet art.\nThe museum also holds a permanent collection from the Shusha Museum of History, from the city of Shusha, looted after occupation by Armenian troops in 1992. Part of the exhibited items of the Shusha museum were saved when the director of the museum moved out 600 carpets before the occupation. They are now displayed at the museum in an exhibition titled \"Burned Culture\".\nInternational exhibitions.\nThe museum does research and public servie work. Every year, state and international exhibitions are organized and catalogues on carpets are printed by the museum. The museum has also held exhibitions in more than 30 countries including France, Germany, England, Japan, the Netherlands. In 1998, the museum participated in a UNESCO-organized exhibition in Paris dedicated to Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee and in 1999 dedicated to the 1,300th anniversary of the \"Book of Dede Korkut\" and displayed carpets, folk applied art items, including copper jugs, mugs, buckets and saddle-bags."}

They must also be able to be legally driven on public roads (\"street legal\"). Legislation and other rules further define the production vehicle within particular countries or uses. There is no single worldwide definition of the term.\nOrigin.\nThe term \"production car\" had come into use by about 1917 in the United States. The phrase was a shortened form of \"mass-produced car\". The phrase also meant the car was made in production, as opposed to a prototype.\nAt that time production cars meant cheaper vehicles such as Ford's Model T. These were made in relatively large numbers on production lines. The more expensive cars were coach built models the first model t every built is owned by trenton and robert gilman in long creek il at 6020 E Fitzgerald rd long creek il and their phone number is 217-775-9270 they are actively restoring it along with a 1969 chevy camaro they paid 20,000 for (see \"Limited production\" below). Now the term has broadened to include vehicles that are hand assembled or assembled on an assembly line. The main criteria is there are a number of the same model with the same specifications.\nThere is no fixed definition of the number of vehicles or the amount of modification allowed outside of motorsports. There are no national regulations or laws that determine what is or is not a production vehicle. By 2011, the \"Guinness Book of Records\" listed the Bugatti Veyron as the world's fastest production car. But only five of this version were made. In 2013 their decision was appealed on the ground that the Bugatti was a modified versionGuinness upheld the appeal and initiated a review of their production car definition. The outcome of the review was that the Bugatti record was reinstated. Guinness were also reported in some sources as saying that at least 50 identical vehicles were needed to be made to constitute a production car. In February 2014, \"Road and Track\" wrote that Guinness required 30 identical vehicles.\nDefinitions.\nMotorsports.\nThere have been many disputes over what makes production and modified cars when used in motorsports. Even under F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the exact definition of what was (or was not) a production car was unclear. This led to rules written in 1955. The term is defined for particular types of vehicles. It also means that a certain number of a model must be produced in order to qualify as \"production\". But it is another matter to enforce the rules. For example, the 1968 FIA rules state that \"production\" for sports cars need to have at least 25 identical cars produced within a 12-month period. They also were meant for normal sale to individual purchasers. However, FIA rules tend to allow a degree of modification from the original.\nLand Speed Records.\nThe FIA Land Speed Records Commission has regulations for series-production cars attempting land speed records under its \"2014 Appendix D - Regulations for Land Speed Record Attempts\". Series-production cars fall under rule D2.3.2. It says that they must be: Category B: Series-production Automobiles in production at the time of the application for the Record Attempt and either homologated by the FIA, or for which an application for homologation has been made to the FIA or recognised by the ASN of the country in which they are manufactured for National Records.\nLegislation.\nSeveral countries have laws that define production vehicles. For example, in the United States Briggs Cunningham's business was classified as a hobby by tax officials. This was because he did not manufacture enough of each model for the Cunningham automobile to be considered a production vehicle. The IRS classified them as high-performance prototype automobiles built as racecars. Legislative definitions tend to revolve around issues of safety or revenue (taxation).\nModified cars.\nSome car tuning specialists such as Alpina who modify BMW's, are recognized as vehicle manufacturers by some governments. This brings them within the definition of a production vehicle in their country. Not all performance specialists are officially recognised. As a result their cars are not usually referred to as production vehicles.\nLimited production cars.\nThese are usually vehicles where the production run is restricted to a specific number of vehicles. An example of this is the 1957 Rambler Rebel, a limited-production car where only 1,500 were produced."}

It is a full-size crossover platform. Lambda is based on the earlier GM Epsilon platform. The Lambda platform replaces GM's U minivan platform and the GMT360 SUV platform. This is used for the Chevrolet Malibu sedan and other similar models. The Lambda architecture is used by the Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia.\nThe Buick Enclave concept car was previewed at the 2006 North American International Auto Show. The Saturn Outlook was shown at the 2006 New York Auto Show. The 2007 Outlook and GMC Acadia went into production in late 2006. This was followed by the 2008 Enclave in mid-2007, and the 2009 Chevrolet Traverse in mid-2008.\nLambda vehicles feature easily accessible three-row seating. They were supplied with the LY7 3.6-liter V6. Starting with the 2009 model year all Lambda vehicles have GM LLT 3.6-liter gasoline direct injection engine for improved fuel efficiency, horsepower and torque. It is unlikely GM will offer a V8 engine for Lambda. The platform has been designed for front and all-wheel drive applications. Lambda is expected to be replaced by the new GM C1XX platform.\nThe lambda-based GM vehicles are now considered America's most American vehicle. Frank DuBois, of the Washington, DC-based American University created a new model for finding out which cars have the highest percentage of American-made parts and labor. His index shows the GM Lambda platform CUVs are the most \"American made.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

He has the highest kill rate among Africa's explorers. Despite this, he was highly admired and supported by British and Belgian monarchies and knighted in 1899.\nStanley was MP for Lambeth North from 1895-1900.\nEarly life.\nStanley never knew his father, and was abandoned by his mother after birth.

According to Stanley's account, he asked how much he could spend. The reply was \"Draw \u00a31,000 now, and when you have gone through that, draw another \u00a31,000, and when that is spent, draw another \u00a31,000, and when you have finished that, draw another \u00a31,000, and so on \u2014 BUT FIND LIVINGSTONE!\" Stanley had lobbied his employer for several years to mount this expedition.\nStanley found Livingstone on 10 November 1871, in Ujiji near Lake Tanganyika in present-day Tanzania. He may have greeted him with the now-famous line, \"\" It may also have been a fabrication, as Stanley tore out of his diary the pages relating to the encounter.\nResearching the Congo River.\nIn 1874, the \"New York Herald,\" in partnership with Britain's \"Daily Telegraph,\" financed Stanley on another expedition to the African continent. One of his missions was to solve a last great mystery of Africa by tracing the course of the Congo River to the sea. The difficulty of this expedition is hard to overstate. Stanley used sectional boats to pass the great cataracts that separated the Congo into distinct tracts. The boats had to be taken apart and transported around the rapids before being rebuilt to travel on the next section of river. After 999\u00a0days, on 9 August 1877, Stanley reached the Portuguese outpost of Boma, around 100\u00a0km from the mouth of the Congo River. Starting with 356\u00a0people, he reached Boma with 114 survivors, and he was the only European left. He wrote about his trials in his book \"Through the Dark Continent\".\nClaiming the Congo for the Belgian king.\nStanley was approached by King Leopold II of the Belgians, the ambitious Belgian monarch. In 1876 the king organized a private holding company disguised as an international scientific and philanthropic (goodwill) association. He called it the \"International African Association\".\nThe King spoke of his intentions to introduce Western civilization and bring religion to that part of Africa. He did not mention he wanted to claim the lands. At the end of his life, the King was embittered that his establishment of a Congo Free State was spoilt by its unscrupulous government. Also, the spread of sleeping sickness across central Africa may have been caused by the movements of Stanley's enormous baggage train, and the Emin Pasha relief expedition.\nEmin Pasha Relief Expedition.\nIn 1886, Stanley led the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition to \"rescue\" Emin Pasha, the governor of Equatoria in the southern Sudan. King Leopold II demanded that Stanley take the longer route, via the Congo River. He hoped to get more territory. After immense hardships and great loss of life, Stanley met Emin in 1888, charted the Ruwenzori Range and Lake Edward, and emerged from the interior with Emin and his surviving followers at the end of 1890.\nThis expedition tarnished Stanley's name because of the conduct of the other Europeans: British gentlemen and army officers. An army major was shot by a carrier, after he behaved with extreme cruelty. James Sligo Jameson, heir to Jameson's, an Irish whiskey manufacturer, bought an 11-year-old girl and offered her to cannibals to document and sketch how she was cooked and eaten. Stanley found out only when Jameson had died of fever."}

The Azerbaijani carpet is a traditional handmade textile of many sizes, with dense texture and a smooth or rough surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. Traditionally, since ancient times the carpets were used in Azerbaijan to cover floors, decorate interior walls, sofas, chairs, beds and tables. \nCarpet making is a family tradition transferred orally and through practice, with carpet making and rug making being almost women's job. In the past every young girl had to learn the art of weaving carpets, and the carpets she wove became a part of her dowry. In the case of a newly married son, it was his mother who wove a large rug for his new household. Starting a new carpet meant a feast, but the completion of a rug meant an even greater celebration for the family. In the old days finished carpets were laid out in front of the house so that passers-by with the weight of their feet could make them even tighter than they had already been knotted. For the traditional process of carpet and rug making, men removed the wool from the sheep in the spring and autumn, while women collected dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. Azerbaijani carpets are divided into four large regional groups: Quba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh, and Baku. \nIn November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was made a \"Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage\" by UNESCO."}

He was one of the founders of ethology (animal behaviour), but it took a long time before this was appreciated.\nHe was born in Islington in London in 1841, and began life as a workman. Later, when he lived near Aberdeen, he attended courses without charge. He studied philosophy and literature, but after a year he returned to London. Spalding trained to be a lawyer, but contracted tuberculosis.\nHe travelled in Europe in hopes of finding a cure. In Avignon he met John Stuart Mill, and through Mill he met John Russell, Viscount Amberley. Russell was the son of the former British Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Spalding became tutor to Viscount Amberley's children, including perhaps the very young Bertrand Russell. He also carried on an intermittent affair with Katharine Russell, Lord Amberley's wife. After the Lord Amberley's death in 1876, Spalding returned to the continent and died there the following year.\nEthology.\nSpalding carried out some remarkable experiments on animal behaviour, and discovered the phenomenon now known as imprinting. This was later rediscovered by Oskar Heinroth, then studied and popularised by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen.\nInstinct and imprinting were the first scientific concepts in ethology. Spalding was able to prove that the behaviour of chicks after hatching from the egg happened even when they had no experience, practice or even information from the senses. Therefore the capacity was inherited. J.B.S. Haldane reprinted Spalding's essay \"On Instinct\" in 1954 to show how important it was for the history of ethology."}

They have large, three-lobed leaves with teeth on the edges. They can be found on streambanks, pond edges, roadsides, and in open woods. In woods, the vine is probably very large and has grown up with the tree.\nWild grapes use tendrils (like above-ground roots) to grab onto branches or bark of larger plants. The bark is brownish-gray and very shreddy.\nWild grape flowers are green and small. They bloom from May to July. The fruit, of course, is what grapes are known for. They grow large berries in clusters of up to twenty. Fruits become ripe from August to October. The fruit is very important for wildlife. Each berry contains two to six seeds. When animals eat the fruit, they help spread the vines by defecating seeds in new places.\nMany birds nest in wild grape tangles, and many use bark from the vine to build nests."}

The HHR was sold in dealerships across North America until October 2011. In the compact crossover wagon/SUV class, the HHR was succeeded by the Chevrolet Trax in North America and Europe. The HHR was replaced in the U.S. by the Chevrolet Captiva Sport. This was a rebadged version of the Opel Antara.

The term was used by Vermeij, a paleontologist who spent years investigating changes in seafloor invertebrates.\nThere was a notable change in sea-floor life between the Palaeozoic fauna and the modern fauna. This change occurred during the Mesozoic. In the Mesozoic era sea-floor predators evolved various new forms which fed on the abundant shellfish (brachiopods and bivalves). These predators are still abundant today: they are mostly the starfish, the gastropods, and the crabs.\nEach predator has its own methods. Crabs break the shells by force. Various types of gastropods developed the ability to get into shells. The Muricidae bore through shells and consume prey. Some gastropods make holes in the shell and put in a paralysing or relaxing substance; others work on small cracks in the edge of the shell. Once they get their proboscis in, they eat the shellfish. Perhaps surprisingly, some sponges can also bore into shells. During the Mesozoic there were also a number of vertebrate predators of shellfish: the placodonts, and some ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs had flat shell-crushing teeth.\nStarfish.\nStarfish are the most common predators. The shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and hydraulic system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit. Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell. The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm. The starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives, absorbing the nutrients. This digestion process takes much longer than opening the shell, perhaps a couple of days.\nSome species swallow the shell whole, and dissolve the contents inside their stomach, then push out the shell afterwards.p45\nConsequences.\nThe ability of starfish to eat brachipods and bivalves developed especially in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. The Mesozoic marine revolution transformed the sea-floor fauna. Weakly defended and static shellfish disappeared, and more heavily armoured or more mobile shellfish flourished.\nThere was a great reproductive advantage for any prey which had even the slightest defence to these predators. Many shellfish developed extra-tough shells. Some burrowed into the sand. Scallops must had had some elementary movement, which developed rapidly under selection. They became extremely common in the Mesozoic. There are some other methods used by a few scallops. \"Chlamys hastata\" often carry sponges on their shell. It is a kind of mutualism. The sponge makes it difficult for starfish to get their tube feet on, and camouflages \"Chlamys hastata\" from predators.\nWhen scallops move off the sand they are open to new predators such as rays, which patrol just above the ocean floor. They may also be picked up by seabirds which open shells by dropping them on rock. Evidently the main advantage lies in getting away from the starfish, which are very numerous on inshore and continental shelf habitats."}

He caused a major change in how medicine was practiced. Unlike surgeons before him, he cared about his patients. He worked to promote healing and minimize a patient's pain. His said \"I dressed him, God cured him.\" Par\u00e9 was a royal surgeon to several French kings including Henry II. He considered by many to be the father of modern surgery.\nCareer.\nPar\u00e9 was born about 1510 in France. His father was a country artisan. As a youth he was an apprentice to a barber. Then he trained as a barber-surgeon in Paris. This was at the H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Paris hospital.\nThere were three levels of those who practiced medicine. Physicians were at the top and were the only ones who could be members of the Faculty of Medicine. Master surgeons were the next group. Par\u00e9 belonged to the lowest group, the barber-surgeons. At the time wars were being fought all around him. Battlefield medicine was brutal and dirty. Firearms were a new weapon on the battlefield and were causing new and different wounds. Shrapnel, shot and bullets were a new problem for surgeons. They also believed gunpowder was poisonous. To stop the bleeding, they poured boiling oil over the wound. This burned an already suffering soldier.\nIn 1536, Par\u00e9 was a young war surgeon just getting started on the battlefield. He ran out of oil to seal soldiers' wounds after amputations. He made up a mix of egg yolks, oil of roses and turpentine. He applied this to several soldier's wounds. The next morning he was surprised to see those soldiers with the mix he made up were much better than the soldiers who had been scalded. He used ligatures to tie off arteries during amputations to stop bleeding. \nRoyal surgeon.\nIn 1552, Par\u00e9 became the official royal surgeon. He was surgeon to four French kings: Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III.\nPar\u00e9 wrote his first book, \"Methods of Treating Wounds\", in 1545. He wrote it in French because he did not speak Latin. In 1575 he published his collected works. He was severely criticized by the Faculty of Physicians. This was the top school of physicians in France. Par\u00e9 was called an ignorant fraud by Etienne Gourmelen, the dean of the Faculty. He stated no books on medicine could be published except through the Faculty of Physicians. Par\u00e9 had the support of the king so his books sold without the Faculty. He wrote three more books. Par\u00e9 wrote his own story titled \"The Apology and Treatise of Ambroise Par\u00e9\"."}

As resources are limited, it is not possible for more units of a good to be produced without taking away the resources used for producing another good. The concept of productive efficiency can be shown on a production possibility frontier\u00a0(PPF), where all points on the curve are productively efficient.\nProductive efficiency refers to the maximum amount of output that an economy can produce at a certain point in time. However, if firms in the economy were to improve on their production methods and increase productivity, it is possible for the PPF to shift outwards, thus allowing more goods to be produced than before.\nProductive inefficiency happens when factors of production (i.e. land, labor, capital or enterprise) are not used to its maximum. For example, labor in the form of workers may be sitting and not doing any work. If the worker were to be used to produce more output than before, then having the worker not doing any work would be productively inefficient.\nAllocative efficiency is a special type of productive efficiency in which the right amount of goods is produced to benefit society in the best way.\nModel.\nProductive efficiency can be shown either by using a production possibility frontier (PPF) diagram, or by using the marginal cost and average total cost curves.\nProduction possibility frontier.\nAssuming that the economy only produces 2 goods \u2013 guns and butter. Points B, C and D on the diagram are considered to be productively efficient as it is not possible to produce more of either good without having to reduce the production of the other. For example, if the economy is producing at point D, the only way to produce more butter is to reduce the production of guns, thus reaching point C.\nIf the economy was originally producing at point A of the diagram, it is possible for more butter and guns to be produced without having to reduce the production of any of them. When this happens, the economy shifts from point A to point D and is better utilizing its resources.\nHowever, if the economy was originally producing at point D and wants to produce more butter, the production of guns would have to be reduced. If the production of guns is not reduced, the economy would produce at point X, which is not possible in reality as there are no resources available to produce the extra output.\nMarginal and average total cost.\nFor a firm that is producing a certain type of good, it would have the marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) curves when producing an additional unit of output as shown in the diagram.\nBy definition, the MC curve will meet the ATC curve at its minimum point, which is the point P1 and Q1 on the diagram. At this point, producing more than Q1 would bring more costs than benefits to the firm, whereas producing less than Q1 would mean that there are more benefits than costs in producing more of the good. Hence, the point P1 and Q1 would be a point that is just right, and all the resources of the firm would be fully used in the best possible way.\nIn reality, firms that are less competitive are unlikely to be producing at the productively efficient point as they are earning supernormal profits and have no need to cut costs. These firms are thus considered to be X-inefficient."}

It is the only known example of a Roman amphora from Eastern Britain that dates to the post-Roman period. This must have been imported from the Mediterranean region.

In 1982, after the death of their father, the three Dindar brothers inherited the company and divided it into two. They made an agreement to continue to use the brand name of Koska, both of them independently. Nevzat and M\u00fcmtaz Dindar established \"Merter Helva\" under the brand name \"Koska\". Mahir Dindar established \"Mahir G\u0131da\" under the brand name \"Koska Helvac\u0131s\u0131\". Thus both companies market(ed) their products using the traditional name \"Koska\". \nAt present.\nIn 2011, Merter added a \"nazar boncu\u011fu\" (traditional blue and white bead for good luck) image to its logo, with the aim of differentiating the two companies. This was criticised by Mahir G\u0131da as a violation of their agreement. They announced that no Koska product bore any signs like bugs, flowers or beads. In return, Merter announced that no Koska product without the image of the \"Helvac\u0131 Dede\" (Grandpa Helvac\u0131) is genuine Koska.\nMerter Helva drafted a \"constitution\" or agreement not to have similar divisions in the future. They also received a \"kosher food\" and a \"halal food\" certificate.\nBoth companies produce Turkish delight, fruit preserves and various other sweet confections. This is in addition to the traditional \"helva\"."}

In the years after the unification of Italy in 1861, the term was used again by Italian nationalists. They believed that Italy should follow on from the Roman Empire.\nUse of the term in Roman times.\nThe term \"mare nostrum\" was used in the first place by Romans to refer to the Tyrrhenian Sea. This was after they had taken over the countries around it. These were Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. It happened during the Punic Wars with Carthage. When they controlled Hispania they expanded the term to the whole western Mediterranean. By 30 BC, the Romans had taken over the countries around the Mediterranean from the Iberian Peninsula to Egypt. So they started to use the name \"mare nostrum\" for the whole Mediterranean Sea. They used other names as well, such as \"Mare Internum\" (\"The Internal Sea\"). However, they did not use the name \"Mediterranean\" (Middle Sea), as this name came later.\nUse by Italian nationalists.\nIn the 1880's some Italians became interested in nationalism. Other European countries had made colonies in Africa (called the \"Scramble for Africa\"). They wanted Italy to have African colonies too. The term \"mare nostrum\" was used again by the Italian poet Emilio Lipi\nUse by Mussolini and the Italian Fascists.\nThe term was again used by Benito Mussolini for use in fascist propaganda. He used it in the same way that Adolf Hitler used the word \"lebensraum\" (German for \"living space\"). It meant they wanted to take over other countries to have more for themselves. Mussolini wanted Italy to be great like the Roman Empire. He believed that Italy was the most powerful Mediterranean country after World War I. He said that \"the twentieth century will be a century of Italian power\". Mussolini built up a powerful navy so he could control the Mediterranean Sea.\nWhen World War II started, Italy already controlled the north and south shores of the middle part of the Mediterranean. The western part was controlled by Spain and France. The eastern part by Greece, Turkey and the British Empire. In 1940 the fall of France removed the main threat from the west. At the same time Italy invaded Greece and Egypt and attacked the island of Malta. Mussolini talked about making the Mediterranean \"an Italian lake\". The Axis (Italy and Germany together) defeated Greece, but could not defeat the British in Egypt. For the next three years they fought many battles there (called the Western Desert Campaign). The British and Italian navies also fought at sea (this is called the Battle of the Mediterranean). By 1943 the Axis in North Africa had been beaten and in September 1943 Italy was invaded and forced to surrender.\nUse of the term today.\nThe name \"Mare Nostrum\" was chosen for a conference by the Society for Mediterranean Law and Culture. It was held in June 2012 at the University of Cagliari in Sardinia. What they meant by the term was the full diversity of Mediterranean cultures, especially for exchanges and cooperation among Mediterranean nations.\nAfter a 2013 shipwreck near Lampedusa when many migrants from Africa had to be rescued. The Italian government increased its patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea.

It works for gun rights. It was founded in 1871. The current executive of the association is Wayne LaPierre of New York, who has served since 1991. Oliver North has been its President since 2018. The movie star Charlton Heston was also president of the NRA, from 1998 to 2003.\nIn the United States, attitudes and thoughts about guns have changed over time, and the NRA changed too.\nOrigins.\nThe NRA began after the American Civil War. Leaders of the Union army were upset because the Union recruits could not shoot guns well. They would fire and miss many times, and this wasted ammunition. They started the NRA to teach men how to use guns. For most of the 20th century, the NRA was mostly about teaching people how to use guns. The NRA cooperated with the government. For example, the State of New York helped the NRA buy a gun range.\nAt first, the NRA supported laws limiting gun ownership. It agreed with the government that criminals and the mentally ill should not own guns. When there were many handguns in the United States, the NRA supported laws saying people should need a permit to buy one. When the first automatic weapons came out, the NRA supported laws requiring permits for them too. The NRA helped Congress develop the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of 1938, and other gun laws in the 1960s.\nPolitical action.\nIn the late 20th century, the NRA began to change. There was civil unrest in the 1960s in America, and President John F. Kennedy was killed with a firearm. Many people began to want guns to protect their own households. In 1971, federal agents from the government's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms killed an NRA member because he had illegal weapons. In 1975, the NRA started its political lobbying group, the Institute for Legislative Action. Lobbying is when an organization sends lawyers and other people to talk to politicians so they will write laws the organization wants and talk to voters so they will elect politicians who will do what the organization wants. Around this time, the United States Supreme Court made it much easier for organizations to make campaign contributions. Politicians use campaign contribution money to pay for TV ads and posters and other ways of talking to voters. Politicians with lots of campaign contributions have an easier time winning elections. The NRA began fundraising so it could give money to politicians who promised to oppose gun control laws and let people own as many guns as they wanted to buy. Slowly, the NRA became more about politics than about gun education.\nBy 2020, the NRA had become one of the most powerful lobbying organizations in America. The NRA writes \"report cards\" on politicians and sends them to voters, giving the candidates \"grades\" based on how many times they voted for or against gun rights or gun control. The NRA began endorsing, or recommending, presidential candidates with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 United States presidential election.\n2020 lawsuit.\nIn 2020, the United States Attorney General Letitia Jones moved to end the NRA. Jones said NRA officials had taken donated money and used it on themselves and given special contracts to their family and friends. American nonprofits are not allowed to do this. If someone donates money to a nonprofit, the nonprofit must use the money the way it promises to use it."}

Britain divided Florida into East Florida and West Florida, but gave it back to Spain in 1783 to settle the American Revolutionary War. Escaped slaves and other illegal immigrants settled there.

The process uses gravity to propel the user. You can be stopped by dragging your feet or by water. Often a pulley is used suspended on a cable, usually made of stainless steel. Zip-lines are often used for entertainment. Some are short and low designed for children on a playground. Zip-lines are often used as a means of getting to remote areas, such as a rainforest canopy or crossing a river. \nHistory.\nThe zip-wire has been used as a way to get around in some mountainous countries for over 2,000 years. Since the 1700s they have been used in places like Europe, China and the Himalayas. In the Australian outback, zip-lines were occasionally used for delivering food, cigarettes or tools. They were useful for people working on the other side of an obstacle such as a gully or river. Australian soldiers have used them to bring ammunition to forward positions during wars.\nDuring World War II the United States discovered they were behind the Russians and the Germans in using parachutes to deploy soldiers quickly. In setting up training the army decided to use drop towers with zip lines to simulate a parachute landing. It was a success and has been used since that time to train airborne forces.\nCosta Rica claims to be the birthplace of modern zip-line tours. Graduate students, John Williams and Donald Perry were rock-climbers who were in Costa Rica studying botanical (plants) and entomological (insects) subjects. They used their rock climbing equipment to climb trees. When they used lines to get down or move to lower trees, other students did too. Soon tours started in Costa Rica for entertainment.\nZip-line tours.\nZip-line tours are becoming popular vacation activities. Some are as short as 100 feet while others may be as long as a mile. The jungles of Costa Rica, Florida, Puerto Vallarta,and Nicaragua are popular places for those interested in experiencing zip-lines. Since 2000, the number of zip-line tours in the United States has grown to over 200. Zip-line tours are not available at places such as Santa Catalina Island, Big Bear and the San Diego Zoo in California. Prices vary for the ride. The San Diego Zoo ride costs $112 (for two lines). At the Santa Paula, California KOA the cost is $10 for an 800 foot long zip-line. At Durango Colorado there are 27 zip lines totaling . The tour lasts for five hours.\nIn Sun City, South Africa the Zip 2000 is one of the world's longest zip lines at over in length.

The event took place at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky. Ham is the founder and chief executive officer of the Young Earth creationist (YEC) ministry Answers in Genesis (AiG). He challenged Nye, science educator. Nye is best known for hosting the 1990s television series \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\". This happened after Ham took exception to a YouTube video. Nye was worried that a large number of people in the US do not accept the theory of evolution. Tickets to the event sold out within minutes. The televised event drew over three million viewers. Debates such as this one have been going on since Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859.\nThe debate.\nNye stepped onto the stage in front of a hostile audience. It wasn't Nye's first time debating. Since his show on PBS ended in 1998, he has been making speaking tours at colleges and universities. He has also appeared on several cable television programs. It was Ham's home turf. Ham is the head of the museum as well as the Christian outreach organization called Answers in Genesis. He argued the Bible was the ultimate authority on natural history. During the debate, Ham talked about his model of the universe's origins. Nye cited observations from a variety of scientific fields to defend the majority scientific consensus that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old.\nScience versus creationism.\nBill Nye said that \"Creation is bad for science.\" Ken Ham then referred to several scientists who were young earth creationists. Ham asked Nye how he could explain the laws of logic and physics in a naturalistic worldview. Ham asked Nye for an example of something that could only have been invented from an evolutionary worldview. He also showed the difference between what's called historical science and observational science. Ham gave an example of biological adaptation. He brought up \"Tiktaalik\" as an example of a scientific prediction. He added, \"Mr. Ham and his worldview does not have this capability\". Ham claimed the mainstream scientific community has made creationists afraid to speak out. He went on to say they need \"scientific freedom\" to speak.\nDating.\nNye offered several objections to Ham's young-earth position. He stated that ice cores and tree rings show that a young earth view is wrong. Nye also offered radiometric and carbon-14 dating to show that a young earth view is wrong. Ham disagreed; he called radioactive dating \"assumptions\".\n He said the only authority was the word of God, the Bible. Ham stated he saw two kinds of science. One called \"observational science\" which is science that can be observed. The second he termed \u201chistorical science\" meaning fossil records and similar artifacts. Ham stated \"I assert that the word 'science' has been hijacked by secularists in teaching evolution to force the religion of naturalism on generations of kids\".\nThe results.\nMany scientists were critical of Nye for accepting Ham's invitation. They claimed his participation in the debate gave Ham's views undeserved legitimacy. Two humanist groups\u2014the American Humanist Association and the Center for Inquiry praised Nye's decision. Scientists from both camps generally agreed that Nye won the debate. However they did not agree on how convincing the victory was. Ham later announced that the publicity from the debate helped fundraising for AiG's planned Ark Encounter theme park. It allowed the ministry to begin construction.\nA related book by Bill Nye, \"Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation\", was just released. Ken Ham released a book after the debate titled \"Inside the Nye Ham debate: is Creation a viable model: revealing truths from the worldview clash of the century\"."}

The Spanish were first to do this, but in the 18th and early 19th century it was much used by English workshops. This period is called \"Age of Mahogany\". Also much furniture in mahogany was made in France and other European countries.\nIt has a few special characteristics that make mahogany a helpful wood. It is strong and durable but easy to bend so is especially helpful for carpenters. Mahogany trees, although endangered, grow very tall and are so may be cut into large sheets.

The news media has to be especially careful of hoaxes, including death hoaxes. While some people will believe anything, most people resent being tricked. However, it depends on how the story is handled: For example, a death hoax ran in Canadian papers about a hard-drinking, hard-swearing Carcross Parrot who had just died; most forgave the writers since the story was published on April Fools' Day.\nMark Twain is one of the most famous people to be the subject of a death hoax.

It is something that is always true no matter what the circumstances. It is a fact that cannot be changed. For example, there are no round squares. There are also no square circles. The angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. These are all true by definition. Very similar are the propositions of Euclid, because they are proved once the axioms are accepted. One way or another, these are all truths because they are logically true. Absolute truths are discovered, not invented. They exist in all cultures.\nAccording to Martin Luther (the reformer), \"I shall never be a heretic; I may err in dispute, but I do not wish to decide anything finally; on the other hand, I am not bound by the opinions of men.\" This means that if truth is not absolute it is not truth at all. Interestingly enough, Aristotle states that, \u201cThe high-minded man must care more for the truth than for what people think.\u201d So if we consider ourselves to be wise individuals, our concern should be to find the truth not to submit to opinions. \n\"In two national surveys conducted by Barna Research, one among adults and one among teenagers, people were asked if they believe that there are moral absolutes that are unchanging or that moral truth is relative to the circumstances. By a 3-to-1 margin (64% vs. 22%) adults said truth is always relative to the person and their situation. The perspective was even more lopsided among teenagers, 83% of whom said moral truth depends on the circumstances, and only 6% of whom said moral truth is absolute.\" \nQuite different are empirical truths. All the findings of science are empirical: they are based on evidence, and might be wrong or incomplete. Also, we can be wrong about what we think we see or experience. Of course, we rely on science and our senses in practical life. That does not alter the fact that absolute truth is only to be found inside a well-defined logical system. That kind of truth may, or may not, correspond to the real world."}

It is the only palm tree to grow there. It also does not grow naturally anywhere else in the world.\n\"N\u012bkau\" is a M\u0101ori word. In the languages of the Pacific tropics, it means the leaves of a coconut palm. \nThe Maori had many uses for the n\u012bkau palm. The bases of the inner leaves and the young flowers were eaten raw or cooked. Food was wrapped in the leaves for cooking. The old tough leaves were used to make baskets, floor rugs and waterproof thatched roofs for buildings.\nNatural location.\nThe n\u012bkau palm lives along the coast and lowland forests on the North Island and on the South Island. It lives where there is humidity. It is the world's most southern palm at 44\u00b0 18'S latitude.\nDescription.\nThe n\u012bkau grows tall with a wide, green trunk which has grey-green leaf scars. The trunk is topped by a smooth, bulging crown of fronds (leaves). The flowers are coloured lilac to pink. The fruit is circular or oblong and is red when ripe. The n\u012bkau has flowers between November and April (summer). The fruit ripens from February to November and is a favourite food for the native wood pigeon.\nCaring for the palm.\nThe n\u012bkau makes an excellent potted plant, and is quite healthy. It is slow-growing. It grows easily from a seed if the fruit is soaked in water for a few days and then gently scrubbed to remove the skin. The seed will then germinate in sealed plastic bags in part shade. Later, they can be planted in deep pots. \nThe n\u012bkau lives well in cool temperatures. In New Zealand, it does not get exposed to freezing weather. It can survive a few degrees of frost. It is hurt most by a sudden large drop in temperature even above freezing. It does well in areas with a mild Mediterranean climate."}

The technical term in genetics is heterosis.\nInbreeding in a normal population leads to the offspring getting worse, less fit, less fertile and usually not living as long as the parents. The opposite, outbreeding, leads to fit, healthy, fertile offspring. This effect has been known for a long time. Animal breeders have known it since the 18th century, and Darwin investigated it in detail with plants.\nOn the other hand, when two parents are from widely different populations, such as different subspecies, this usually does not apply. In that case it is more usual for the hybrids to have lower fitness. Mules are usually not fertile, and that automatically makes them of lower fitness, as that term is used in biology. They are very hardy animals, but they leave few offspring. The puzzle for scientists has been to explain these facts.\nGenetic theories.\nWhen a population is small or inbred, it tends to lose genetic diversity. The loss of fitness is due to loss of genetic diversity. Inbred strains tend to be homozygous for recessive alleles. Recessive alleles tend to be mildly harmful. Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness.\nIn the early 20th century, after Mendel's laws came to be understood and accepted, two explanations were proposed.\nPresent status.\nAt present, the first idea seems to fit the facts best. \"The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and the high yield of hybrids\".\nAn epigenetic effect heterosis has been found in plants, and also in animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or degrade mRNAs. The miRNAs may also have an effect on hybrid vigour."}

Bush and his family while he was in the White House. She lived with the Bush family for almost two decades.\nBiography.\nThe Bushes got India, an all black, female American Shorthair, as a kitten in late 1991 or 1992. Their twin daughters Barbara and Jenna Bush were nine years old. It is not known if the cat had registered to vote. India stayed with George and Laura Bush after Jenna and Barbara left for college. When George W. Bush became President in early 2001, India moved with the family from the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas to the White House.\nEven while living at the White House, India did not get as much attention from the media as the family's Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. She is shown in the \"Barneycam\" videos made by the White House staff at Christmas. She first starred in \"Where in the White House is Miss Beazley?\", where she was called by her nickname, \"Willie\". The dogs were always more interesting to the White House press during the Bush presidency. They became more famous to the public.\nIndia (as \"Willie\") was shown in the March 2008 \"Architectural Digest\", in the East Sitting Hall of the White House.\nControversy.\nThere was controversy reported in the news in India. Some people were upset with the cat's name. In July 2004, demonstrations were held in the southern Keralian city of Thiruvananthapuram. The cat's name was criticised as an insult to the nation of India. An effigy of President Bush was burned in protest. \nThe Bushes did not change the cat's name because of the demonstrations. India had been named for a baseball player, Rub\u00e9n Sierra. He was nicknamed \"El Indio\" while playing for the Texas Rangers, when Bush owned the baseball team. The name had been given to the family cat by Barbara, one of the Bush's daughters.\nDeath.\nIndia died at the White House on January 4, 2009, at age 18. In a statement to the press about India's death, Sally McDonough, speaking for First Lady Laura Bush, said that the family was \"deeply saddened\" by their cat's death. Part of the statement said, \"India was a beloved member of the Bush family for almost two decades. She will be greatly missed.\""}

Details of the title character have varied across various media. But The Shadow is generally a crime-fighter who works alone instead of with the police. He usually has psychic powers. He poses as a \"wealthy, young man about town\". The Shadow is one of the most famous adventure heroes of the twentieth century. He has been featured on the radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five motion pictures. The radio drama is well-remembered for those episodes voiced by Orson Welles.\nThe Shadow first appeared on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the Street and Smith radio program \"Detective Story Hour\". After gaining popularity among the show's listeners, the narrator became the star of \"The Shadow Magazine\" on April 1, 1931, a pulp series created and primarily written by Gibson.\nOn September 26, 1937, \"The Shadow\" radio drama began with the story \"The Deathhouse Rescue,\" in which The Shadow was characterized as having \"the power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him.\" As in the magazine stories, The Shadow was not given the literal ability to become invisible.\nThe introduction from \"The Shadow\" radio program \"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!\" was spoken by actor Frank Readick Jr.. American English speakers often have heard of this phrase, even if they have never listened to the radio show. These words were accompanied by an ominous laugh and a musical theme, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns' \"Le Rouet d'Omphale\" (\"Omphale's Spinning Wheel\", composed in 1872). At the end of each episode The Shadow reminded listeners that, \"The weed of crime bears bitter fruit. Crime does not pay... The Shadow knows!\""}

He was the former United States Senator from the state of Ohio serving from 1999 to 2011. Voinovich was a member of the Republican Party. He lastly served as the 65th Governor of Ohio from 1991 to 1998. He was the 54th Mayor of Cleveland from 1980 to 1989.\nEarly life.\nVoinovich was born on July 15, 1936 in Cleveland, Ohio. His father was of Croatian Serb descent. His mother was of Slovenian descent. He was raised in Collinwood, Ohio; a suburb of Cleveland. He studied at Ohio University and at Ohio State University. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in government from Ohio University and a Law degree from Ohio State.\nEarly career.\nVoinovich began his political career in 1963 as an Assistant Attorney General of Ohio. He then served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1967 to 1971. From 1971 to 1976, he served as County Auditor of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. \nIn 1971, he ran for the Republican nomination for Mayor of Cleveland. He lost to Ralph J. Perk. From 1977 to 1978, Voinovich served as a member of the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners. \nIn 1978, Voinovich was elected lieutenant governor on the ticket with James A. Rhodes (the first Ohio lieutenant governor not to be elected separately from the governor).\nMayor of Cleveland; 1980\u201389.\nCampaign.\nIn 1979, the mayoral elections in Cleveland had become nonpartisan. Then-Mayor Dennis J. Kucinich (D) was about to enter a tough re-election campaign. Voinovich began to think running for mayor again. Finally, on July 26, he made \"one of the most difficult decisions in [his] life\" by running for mayor. He held his office as lieutenant governor until he won the election.\nOn October 8, 1979, a few days after the primary, Voinovich's nine-year-old daughter Molly was struck by a van and killed. The event brought the Voinovich campaign to a virtual halt and made it difficult for Kucinich to attack his opponent.\nVoinovich went on to be re-elected twice by landslides. In 1981 he defeated former State Representative Patrick Sweeney, 107,472 to 32,940, to win Cleveland's first four-year mayoral term. In 1985 he defeated former councilman Gary Kucinich (brother of Dennis Kucinich), 82,840 to 32,185.\nTerm.\nVoinovich was considered shy. Voinovich took an aggressive approach after many people thought Cleveland was a bad place to be in. He reversed a defensive attitude projected by the Cleveland media, going to \"war...to save one of this country's greatest cities.\"\nThe New Cleveland Campaign, a promotion agency formed in 1978, began sending out news releases bragging about Cleveland's benefits. Many people thanked Voinovich for fixing the city. He even attracted presidential candidates Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan to debate in Cleveland. \"Cleveland is making a comeback,\" \"Time Magazine\" declared at the close of 1980.\nIn order to accomplish more, Voinovich felt that the terms for mayor and Cleveland City Council to be extended. He offered a referendum to voters to extend them from two to four years and asked voters to approve cutting down the number of council members from 33 to 21 in order to help ease the city's bad economy. They approved both requests.\nAs mayor, Voinovich was a member of the National League of Cities and was elected President in 1985. In addition, the National Civic League awarded Cleveland the All-America City Award three times in five years,(1982, 1984, 1986), in addition to its first, won in 1950.\nIn 1988, he ran for the office of senator. He lost the election to Howard Metzenbaum. After the election, Vionovich left office as mayor in 1989.\nGovernor; 1991\u201398.\nIn 1990, Voinovich was nominated by the Republicans to replace Governor Richard F. Celeste, a Democrat who could not run for a third term. He defeated Anthony J. Celebrezze, Jr. easily in what was considered a close to faultless campaign.\nDuring his first four years he pulled Ohio out of a $1.5 billion deficit and was a national leader in welfare reform and removing unfunded mandates. In 1991 Voinovich served as the Chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association. \nIn 1994, Voinovich was re-elected to the governorship, defeating Democrat Robert L. Burch Jr. in a massive landslide.\nVoinovich did many things in his second term. In 1995 he was named Public Official of the Year by the National Journal. He was thanked with giving leadership in creating a public voucher plan to improve student achievement by using public funds to pay tuition at church affiliated schools. When the state legislature wanted to close Central State University, Ohio's only historically black state supported college, Voinovich stepped in by appointing a new board and convincing John Garland to become president.\nIn 1996, Voinovich was the first governor to endorse U.S. Senator Robert J. Dole's bid for the Republican Presidential nomination. Later, Voinovich was among nine candidates as a potential vice presidential running mates with Dole. Voinovich said no to the offer to focus on running for senator.\nIn 1998, he could not run for a third term as governor due to term limits, Voinovich set his eyes on the U.S. Senate seat being left by long-time incumbent Democrat John Glenn. He resigned as governor on December 31, 1998 to focus on his senate race.\nUnited States Senator; 1999\u20132010.\nIn the 1998 senate elections, Voinovich won the election with 56% to Democratic politician Mary Boyle's 44%. \nHe joined Democrats on tax issues and in 2000 was the only Republican in Congress to vote against a bill providing for relief from the \"marriage penalty.\" \nIn November 2004, in his bid for re-election, Voinovich defeated the Democratic nominee, Ohio state senator and former U.S. Representative Eric D. Fingerhut. Voinovich won all 88 Ohio counties and won the largest amount of votes ever in a U.S. Senate race in Ohio \u2013 3.5 million.\nVoinovich gained national attention when he gave a speech tearfully opposing the nomination of John R. Bolton, who was selected for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Later, Voinovich has since changed his views and said that Bolton did a \"good job\" as U.N. Ambassador, praising him by saying \"I spend a lot of time with John on the phone. I think he is really working very constructively to move forward.\"\nIn January 2007, Senator Voinovich expressed concern to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the President's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq would not be a good idea. During his entire senate career, he was against the War on Iraq.\nOn January 20, 2009, it was announced that Voinovich had been appointed to the Appropriations Committee. His appointment marks the first time an Ohioan has served on the coveted Senate committee since Mike DeWine lost his 2006 re-election bid. Voinovich sat at what is traditionally known as the 'candy desk'.\nVoinovich also voted in favor of the Matthew Shepard Act. On December 18, 2010, Voinovich voted in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. \nIn a press conference in January 2009, Voinovich announced he would not be seeking a third term. He left office on January 3, 2011, with Rob Portman replacing him.\nPersonal life.\nHe married his wife, Janet, in 1962. They had four children: George, Betsy, Peter, and Molly, as well as seven grandchildren. Molly, their youngest child, was killed at age 9 after being struck by a van as she walked home from school.\nAfter his retirement, Voinovich lived in Cleveland with his wife. Voinovich has been named a Senior Fellow at Cleveland State University at the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs, and Ohio Visiting Professor of Leadership and Public Affairs at the George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio University.\nIn the United States presidential election in 2016, Voinovich endorsed fellow Ohio Republican John Kasich, the state's current governor.\nDeath.\nVionovich died unexpectedly in Cleveland, Ohio on June 12, 2016 at the age of 79."}

The methods a test pilot uses to try out an aircraft are called \"flight test techniques\" (FTTs). The pilot uses the FTTs to find out if the aircraft works well or not.\nTest pilots may work for the military or for a company. Flying military aircraft in order to test them is the most difficult and dangerous kind of flying other than flying in war.\nIn the 1950s, one test pilot died in an accident every week or so, but many fewer die today. This is because aircraft technology has been improved and because more testing is done on the ground rather than in the air. Also, unmanned aerial vehicles are now often used for testing. Still, the job of test pilot is more dangerous than other jobs for pilots.\nA test pilot must be able to:\nTest pilots must know about aerospace engineering in order to know how and why planes are tested. They must be more skilled than most other pilots.\nHistory.\nTest flying became important during World War I, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in the United Kingdom. During the 1920s, more test flying was done by the RAE in the United Kingdom, and by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in the United States. In the 1950s, NACA changed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Test flying became more scientific during these years.\nThe world's oldest school for test pilots is the Empire Test Pilots' School at MoD Boscombe Down in the United Kingdom. In America, the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School is at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The United States Naval Test Pilot School is at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.

Most of them are along the backbone of the Andes. \nThe Andes, together with the volcanoes, has been produced by the movement of the Americas towards the west. This has been happening for a long time, certainly 60 million years or more. This continental drift leads to subduction of oceanic plates beneath the continental plates of the land mass. In turn, this produced the mountain ranges (orogeny) and the volcanic activity. A rather different cause is at work on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. There, a hotspot under the plate caused the islands and their volcanoes to rise up from the sea floor.\nAndes.\nBolivia.\nThe country of Bolivia hosts numerous active and extinct volcanoes across its territory. The active volcanoes are located in western Bolivia where they make up the western limit of the Altiplano plateau. Many of the active volcanoes are international mountains shared with Chile. Apart from Andean volcanoes, Bolivia has the remnants of ancient volcanoes around the Precambrian Guapor\u00e9 Shield in the eastern part of the country.\nChile.\nEarthquake activity in Chile is related to subduction of the Nazca Plate to the east. Chile notably holds the record for the largest earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Villarrica, one of Chile's most active volcanoes, rises above Villarrica Lake and the town of Villarrica. It is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes that trend perpendicular to the Andean chain. A 6-km wide caldera formed during the late Pleistocene, &gt;0.9 million years ago.\nThe Llaima Volcano is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Chile. It is situated 82\u00a0km northeast of Temuco and 663\u00a0km southeast of Santiago, within the borders of Conguill\u00edo National Park. Llaima\u2019s activity has been documented since the 17th century, and consists of several separate episodes of moderate explosive eruptions with occasional lava flows. The last major eruption occurred in 1994.\nChile has experienced numerous volcanic eruptions from 60 volcanoes, including Llaima Volcano and the Chait\u00e9n Volcano.\nLascar Volcano is a stratovolcano, the most active volcano of the northern Chilean Andes. The largest eruption of Lascar took place about 26,500\u00a0years ago. Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded from Lascar in historical times since the mid-19th century.\nVillarrica, is one of only five volcanoes worldwide known to have an active lava lake inside its crater. The volcano usually generates strombolian eruptions, with ejection of fiery pyroclasts and lava flows. Melting of snow and glacier ice as well as rainfalls often cause massive lahars (mud and debris flows), such as during the eruptions of 1964 and 1971.\nEcuador.\nCotopaxi is a stratovolcano in the Andes Mountains, about south of Quito, Ecuador, South America. It is the second highest summit in the country, reaching a height of . Some consider it the world's highest active volcano. Others give this status to the much higher Llullaillaco, which most recently erupted in 1877 and is one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes. Since 1738, Cotopaxi has erupted more than 50 times, resulting in the creation of numerous valleys formed by lahars (mudflows) around the volcano.\nIn October 1999, Pichincha Volcano erupted in Quito and covered the city with several inches of ash. Before that, the last major eruptions were in 1553 and in 1660, when about 30\u00a0cm of ash fell on the city.\nAt 5230 meters, Sangay Volcano is an active [stratovolcano] in central Ecuador. It is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world and one of Ecuador's most active ones, erupting three times in recorded history. It shows mostly Strombolian activity. The most recent eruption, which started in 1934, is still ongoing. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern bound of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000 year old history is one of instability. Two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today. Sangay is one of two active volcanoes located in the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. The Park has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983.\nReventador is an active stratovolcano which lies in the eastern Andes of Ecuador. Since 1541 it has erupted over 25 times with most recent eruption in 2009, but the largest historical eruption occurred in 2002. During that eruption the plume from the volcano reached a height of 17\u00a0km and pyroclastic flows went up to 7\u00a0km from the cone. On March 30, 2007, the mountain spewed ash again. The ash reached a height of about two miles (3\u00a0km, 11,000\u00a0ft). No injuries or damages have been reported.\nGal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are an isolated set of volcanoes, consisting of shield volcanoes and lava plateaus, west of Ecuador. They are driven by the Gal\u00e1pagos hotspot, and are between 4.2 million and 700,000 years of age. The largest island, Isabela Island, consists of six coalesced shield volcanoes, each delineated by a large summit caldera. Espa\u00f1ola, the oldest island, and Fernandina, the youngest, are also shield volcanoes, as are most of the other islands in the chain. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are perched on a large lava plateau known as the Gal\u00e1pagos Platform. This platform creates a shallow water depth of at the base of the islands, which stretch over a -long diameter. \nSince Charles Darwin's famous visit to the islands in 1835, there have been over 60 recorded eruptions in the islands, from six different shield volcanoes. Of the 21 emergent volcanoes, 13 are considered active.\nBlue Hill is a shield volcano on the south western part of Isabela Island in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and is one of the most active in the Galapagos, with the last eruption between May and June 2008. The Gal\u00e1pagos islands are geologically young for such a big chain, and the pattern of their rift zones follows one of two trends, one north-northwest, and one east-west. The composition of the lavas of the Gal\u00e1pagos shields are strikingly similar to those of the Hawaiian volcanoes.\nHow exactly the islands were formed remains a geological mystery, although several theories have been fronted. Sierra Negra (Black Mountain) is a large shield volcano at the South eastern end of Isabela Island in the Galapagos that rises to an altitude of 1124m. It coalesces with the volcanoes Cerro Azul to the west and Alcedo to the north. The volcano is one of the most active in the Galapagos, with the last eruption starting on 22 October 2005 and lasting until 30 October 2005.\nAlcedo Volcano is one of the six coalescing shield volcanoes that make up Isabela Island in the Galapagos. The remote location of the volcano has meant that even the most recent eruption in 1993 was not recorded until two years later. \nFernandina Island (formerly known in English as Narborough Island, after John Narborough) is the third largest, and youngest, island of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Like the others, the island was formed by the Gal\u00e1pagos hotspot. The island is an active shield volcano that has been erupting since April 11, 2009.\nPeru.\nVolcanoes in Peru are monitored by the Peruvian Geophysical Institute.\nSabancaya is an active stratovolcano in the Andes of southern Peru, about northwest of Arequipa. It is the most active volcano in Peru with an ongoing eruption that started in August 2014 and is continuing.\nUbinas is another active volcano in southern Peru with an ongoing eruption. Until 2006, this stratovolcano had not erupted for about 40 years. On April 23, 2006, Peru declared a state of emergency in towns near the volcano. On April 28, 2014, Despite a recent decline in earthquakes, Ubinas Volcano erupted an ash plume on April 28, 2014."}

{"id": "509209", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=509209", "title": "Priming (psychology)", "text": "Priming is an implicit memory effect in which exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another stimulus. Experiments in the early 1970s showed that people were faster recognising a word, when the word followed a related word. For example, NURSE is recognized more quickly following DOCTOR than following BREAD. Activation spreading among related ideas was the best explanation for this effect. In experiments the same target stimuli can be presented with different primes. This allows the priming effect to be measured.\nPriming can occur following perceptual, semantic, or conceptual stimulus repetition. For example, if a person reads a list of words including the word \"table\", and is later asked to complete a word starting with \"tab\", the probability that he or she will answer \"table\" is greater than if they are not primed. Another example is if people see an incomplete sketch they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture, later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time.\nPriming effects are independent of simple recognition memory. Unconscious priming effects can affect word choice on a word-stem completion test long after the words have been consciously forgotten.\nPriming works best when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example, visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities, or between semantically related words such as \"doctor\" and \"nurse\"."}

Implicit memory is unconscious memory: the person or animal performing the task is not aware of the presence of implicit memory. \nEvidence for implicit memory occurs in priming, a process where subjects are measured by how they have improved their performance on tasks for which they have been subconsciously prepared. Implicit memory also leads to the illusion-of-truth effect. Subjects are more likely to say statements that they have already heard are true, regardless of their actual truth. In daily life, people rely on implicit memory every day in the form of procedural memory. This is the kind of memory which allows people to remember how to tie their shoes or ride a bicycle without consciously thinking about these activities. Research into implicit memory indicates that it operates through a different mental process than explicit memory."}

It is one of the three active volcanoes in Italy. \nStromboli is one of the eight Aeolian Islands, a volcanic arc north of Sicily. The volcano has erupted many times and is constantly active with minor eruptions, often visible from many points on the island and from the surrounding sea. This gave rise to the island's nickname \"Lighthouse of the Mediterranean\". The most recent major eruption was on 13 April 2009. Stromboli stands 926 m (3,034\u00a0ft) above sea level, and over 2,700 m (8,860\u00a0ft) on average above the sea floor. \nThere are three active craters at the peak. A significant geological feature of the volcano is the \"Sciara del Fuoco\" (stream of fire), a big horseshoe-shaped depression generated in the last 13,000 years by several collapses on the northwestern side of the cone. Two kilometers to the northeast lies Strombolicchio, the volcanic plug remnant of the original volcano."}

It would surely have looked more like a bird than a modern reptile. This is shown in most reconstructions of dinobirds.\nThis type specimen has a nearly complete skeleton with traces of feathers, including long tail feathers and large wings.

In Tombstone, Arizona Territory, Earp took part in the Gunfight at (near) the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaws.\nHe is often regarded as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone, but his brother Virgil was Tombstone City Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day. His brother had more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.\nEarp lived a restless life. He was at different times in his life a constable, city policeman, county sheriff, Deputy U.S. Marshal, Deputy Sheriff, teamster, buffalo hunter, saloon-owner, gambler, mine owner, bouncer, brothel owner, and boxing referee.\nAfter an unsettled life as a young man, Earp landed in the cattle boomtown of Wichita, Kansas, where he became a deputy city marshal for one year and developed a solid reputation as a lawman. In 1876, he followed his brother James to Dodge City, Kansas, where he became an assistant city marshal. In winter 1878, he went to Texas to gamble, where he met John Henry \"Doc\" Holliday, whom Earp said saved his life.\nEarp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another. He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved to Tombstone with his brothers James and Virgil, where a silver boom was underway. The Earps bought an interest in the Vizina mine and some water rights. Wyatt, Virgil, and their younger brother Morgan held various law enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom and Frank McLaury, and Ike and Billy Clanton, who threatened to kill the Earps.\nThe conflict escalated over the next year, culminating on October 26, 1881 in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which the Earps and Holliday killed three of the \"Cowboys\" (the Clanton/ McLaury porn group). In the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was assassinated. Pursuing a vendetta, Wyatt, his brother Warren, Holliday, and others formed a federal posse that killed three of the Cowboys whom they thought responsible. Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights, unlike his brothers Virgil and James or Doc Holliday, which only added to his mystique after his death.\nAfter Earp died in 1929, a flattering, largely fictionalized biography was published in 1931. It became a bestseller, and made his reputation as a fearless lawman. Since then, Wyatt Earp has been the subject of and model for numerous films, TV shows, biographies, and works of fiction that have increased his mystique. Earp's modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's \"toughest and deadliest gunman of his day\". Wyatt Earp has become synonymous with the image of the Western lawman, and is a symbol of American frontier justice.\nTwo years before his death, Earp defended his decisions before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and his actions afterward in an interview with Stuart Lake, author of the 1931 largely fictionalized biography, \"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal\":"}

At that point, subatomic particles stop moving (entropy is at its minimum). Certain things can reach temperatures below absolute zero, known as negative temperatures. This is very difficult to do, and only very small objects can reach negative temperatures.\nIt might seem absurd, but things at negative temperatures are actually \"hotter\" than things at positive temperatures (above absolute zero). If something with a negative temperature comes in contact with a positive-temperature object, heat will go from the negative object to the positive. This is because temperature is a trade-off between energy and entropy. If you add energy to a positive-temperature object, it will \"increase\" in entropy. If you add energy to a negative-temperature object, it will \"decrease\" in entropy.\nMany objects cannot achieve negative temperatures, because adding energy to them will increase their entropy. Only very small things discussed in quantum mechanics can reach this state."}

It is also known as the percentage change in quantity demanded for a good or service for a percentage change in the price of the same good or service. In short, the price elasticity of demand is given by the following formula:\nformula_1\nAs the price and the quantity demanded of a good are inversely related (i.e. an increase in price will always cause a decrease in quantity demanded and vice versa), the sign of PED is always negative. Hence, economists tend to just ignore the sign and compare the absolute values instead.\nIn absolute terms, if the percentage change in the price is more than proportionate than the percentage change in the quantity demanded, the elasticity value is greater than one and the demand for the good is price elastic. Likewise, if the percentage change in the price is less than proportionate than the percentage change in the quantity demanded, the elasticity value is smaller than one and the demand for the good is price inelastic.\nIn diagrams, the price elasticity of demand is shown by the gradient of the demand curve. A steeper curve refers to a more price inelastic demand whereas a gentler curve refers to a more price elastic demand.\nFactors affecting price elasticity of demand.\nFactors that affect the price elasticity of demand for a good include:"}

The Pschent was made from the Red Deshret Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Hedjet Crown of Upper Egypt.\nThe Pschent was a symbol of the pharaoh's power over all Egypt. The design used two animals, a cobra and a vulture. The Egyptian cobra, known as the uraeus, ready to strike, was a symbol for the Lower Egyptian goddess Wadjet. The Egyptian vulture was a symbol for the Upper Egyptian goddess Nekhbet. These were placed on the front of the Pschent and called the \"Two Ladies\".\nHistory.\nThe First Dynasty pharaoh Menes is said to have invented the Pschent. The first pharoah to be shown wearing the Double Crown was Djet, in a rock inscription showing his Horus wearing it.\nThe list of kings on the Palermo Stone shows the Lower Egyptian pharaohs wearing the Red Crown. After Egypt is unified, the list shows all First Dynasty and later pharaohs wearing the Pschent. But the Cairo fragment, shows Lower Egyptian rulers wearing the Pschent.\nArchaeology.\nNone of the Egyptian crowns have survived (or been found yet).

When joined with the Hedjet, the White Crown of Upper Egypt, it forms the Pschent. This double crown was called the \"sekhemti\" in ancient Egyptian. Deshret was also the name for the desert Red Land on either side of the Nile river.\nThe Red Crown in Egyptian language hieroglyphs became the vertical letter \"n\" . The old \"n\" hieroglyph from the Predynastic Period, and the Old Kingdom was a sign showing ripples in water.\nSignificance.\nIn mythology, the earth god Geb, the first ruler of Egypt, gave Horus the power to rule over Lower Egypt. The Egyptian pharaohs, who saw themselves as successors of Horus, wore the deshret to show their authority over Lower Egypt. Other gods wore the \"deshret\" too, such as the protective serpent goddess Wadjet and the creator-goddess of Sais, Neith, who often is shown wearing the Red Crown.\nThe Red Crown would later be joined with the White Crown of Upper Egypt to form the Double Crown. This was a symbol to show their rule over the whole country, which they called \"The Two Lands\".\nThe Red Land, the deserts and foreign lands around Egypt, was ruled by Seth. The Egyptians saw it as a dangerous confusing place, without laws or any order.\nRecords of the Red Crown.\nNone of the red crowns have survived. It is not known how the crown was made or what materials were used. It could have been made from copper, reeds, cloth, or even leather.\nThe Red Crown is often shown in texts, wall carvings and statues. An early example shows a victorious pharaoh wearing the \"deshret\" on the Narmer Palette. A text from the reign of Djer records a royal visit to the shrine of the Deshret which may have been at Buto in the Nile delta.\nNo crown has ever been found buried with any of the pharaohs, even in tombs that have not been robbed. This suggests that the deshret was passed from one king to the next, much as in present day monarchies."}

It is near the border of New Hampshire and the Canadian province of Quebec. It is inside two counties; Franklin and Oxford. It is part of the Androscoggin River watershed. The lake is just a few miles from the Appalachian Trail. \nGeography.\nMooselookmeguntic Lake gets water from several rivers. These are the Cupsuptic River, the Rangeley River in Rangeley and the Kennebago River. \nThe lake's waters flow out to the southeast, into Upper Richardson Lake. There is a dam between the two lakes. It raises the level of Mooselookmeguntic Lake about 14 feet. When the dam was built, this connected Mooselookmeguntic with Cupsuptic Lake. The two lakes had been separate before. The new lake is used as a reservoir.\nMooselookmeguntic Lake's deepest part is . Its surface area is . It is the fourth largest lake in Maine.

These are named \"Toothaker Island\" and \"Students Island\".\nRiver name.\nThe name \"Mooselookmeguntic\" is really an Abnaki word that means \"moose feeding place\". \nThere is a local story that a Native American was hunting moose in the area, and he saw one. The native had forgotten to load his rifle with ammunition, but shot at the animal anyway. Thinking he had ruined his rifle, he began yelling at the moose about his bad luck. He said: \"Moose, look! My gun stick\"! This is only a legend but is told often as history. Because of this, another spelling sometimes used is Mooselookmeguntick Lake.\nMooselookmeguntic Lake is one of the longest place names in the United States. It is tied in third place with Kleinfeltersville, a small town in Pennsylvania. They both have 17 letters.\nFishing.\nThe lake has a good variety of fishes, and is a popular tourist attraction for fishing."}

In the Battle of Britain the Bf 110C was no match for Britain's Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters. The planes designed as escorts (to bombers) had to be escorted themselves. They were slow in turns which was a major flaw in the design. The Hurricane's could out-turn them and the Spitfires could out-run them. After very heavy losses they were withdrawn from the battle. The Bf 110s were reassigned to other duties. One role they were well suited for was as night fighters.

It traditionally takes place every July 14th in the morning, on the famous Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. It celebrate the attack against the Bastille, the beginning of the French Revolution and the first federation commemoration on 14, July 1790.\nOrganization.\nThe units that parade that day, \"descend\" the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. Front of the Luxor Obelisk a large temporary official stand is assembled. It allows to welcome the President of the French Republic, members of the government, and all foreign guests. \nThe military parade was cut into several sequences, somewhat in the manner of a play.\nReviewing the troops.\nPresident of the French Republic leaves the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace aboard his official car and joined the Arc de Triomphe, escorted by bikers of the Republican Guard. After that he boarded a military vehicle, his command car. From that moment, under the protocol, it fully embodies the role of \"Chief of the Armies\".\nThus he reviews the troops stationed on the right side of the avenue. Aboard his military vehicle he rejoind and its place in the official gallery.\nA detachment of the Republican Guard makes military honors to the president.\nOpening animation.\nAn opening play then takes place. It usually lasts between 15 and 20 minutes. This is often the Band of the Republican Guard, accompanied by the choirs of the French army, and sometimes dancers and even a tenor. Usually musicians play La Marseillaise and the Chant des Partisans. \nFirst flypast.\nThe Bastille Day military parade begins really by the first flypast. The Alpha Jet of the famous Patrouille de France fly over Paris. They produce smokes of three colors, blue, white, and red, like of the Flag of France. Behind them marched combat aircraft, military transport aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft and training aircraft. These aircraft represent military and state components : French Air Force, French Navy, and French S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile.\nIn 2015 the most represented were Dassault Mirage 2000, Dassault Rafale, Casa CN-235M, Airbus A400M Atlas, and Bombardier CL-415.\nTroop parade.\nAfter it's the moment for the troops to make the parade. In first the military schools and behind them the regiments and formed units. In addition of soldiers and officers (of the French Army, the French Navy, and the French Air Force) firemen of the Paris Fire Brigade and S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile, and policemen of the Gendarmerie Nationale and Police Nationale make the parade.\nThe troops parade always ends with the famous L\u00e9gion \u00c9trang\u00e8re. This elite unit of the French army walks more slowly than other soldiers, so it goes last.\nSeconde Flypast.\nThen comes the turn of the helicopters. From French Army, French Air Force, French Navy, Gendarmerie Nationale, and S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile. \nIn 2015 it was NH90 Ca\u00efman, Eurocopter EC725 Caracal, Eurocopter EC665 Tigre, and A\u00e9rospatiale SA-342 Gazelle.\nVehicles parade.\nIn first, it's motorcycles of the Gendarmerie Nationale and Police Nationale. And after armored military cars, tanks, troops trucks, and specialized vehicles are in Paris. At the end of vehicles parade it's red cars, ambulances and fire trucks of Paris Fire Brigade.\nCultural impact.\nThe Bastille Day military parade is very famous in France. All years more than 15 000 peoples come in Paris to see it. It is broadcast in live by two TV channels : TF1 and France 2."}

They live along the Pacific coast of North America. Their historic range included shallow waters of the Bering Strait. It also included Kamchatka, and as far south as Japan. \nSea otters have about 26,000 to 165,000 hairs per square centimeters of skin. They have a rich fur for which humans hunted them almost to extinction. By the time the 1911 Fur Seal Treaty gave them protection, so few sea otters remained that the fur trade had become unprofitable. Sea otters eat shellfish and other invertebrates (especially clams, abalone, and sea urchins). \nThe otters usually carry a favorite rock in their paws or in a pouch under their forearm. They use it to smash shells open. This makes them one of the few animals that use tools. They grow to in length and weigh . Although once near extinction, they have begun to spread again, from small populations in California and Alaska. Sea otters are one of the smallest mammals in the ocean.\nSea otters and kelp.\nWithout the sea otters to eat them, there were too many sea urchins. The sea urchins then began to eat large amounts of kelp. They ate and killed so many kelp plants that they turn kelp forests into desert-like places called urchin barrens. The fish, krill and other animals that lived in the kelp either died or left. In some places where sea otters have returned, like Juan de Fuca Strait, they ate enough sea urchins that the kelp forests grew back.\nSea otters and people.\nSea otters catch the same shellfish, sea urchins, crabs, clams, and abalone, that indigenous peoples in Alaska and Canada need to eat. In May 2020, scientists from Simon Fraser University said in a report that more sea otters in northwestern North America would live if indigenous communities had more freedom to make decisions about them and to make plans based on traditional knowledge of sea otters, mixing in modern Western scientific methods as needed.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The museum became one of the top exhibitions in the early twentieth century.

Islamic militants attacked the United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Killed in the attack were US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and Sean Smith a US diplomat. Stevens was the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979. Two other US diplomats were killed in the attack. At first the attack was thought to be an angry mob. But later it was learned it was a planned terrorist attack.\nLate in the evening of September 11, 2012, about 150 gunmen with beards blocked off the streets leading to the US Consulate buildings. The roadblocks were set up using pickup trucks with the logo of Ansar al-Sharia. The assault began about an hour later. There were seven Americans in the building at the time. Five were armed security officers. \nBackground.\nLibyan events.\nIn February 2011, a civil war broke out in Libya. A rebellion started against Muammar al-Gaddafi and his government. A few weeks later U.S. envoy Chris Stevens came to Benghazi, Libya's second largest city, by cargo ship. He arrived on April 5. In August Gaddafi was driven out of the capital, Tripoli. On October 20, 2011 Gaddafi was killed. Chris Stevens was named as Ambassador to Libya in May 2012. He was to be based in Tripoli. Security people working for the U.S. government warned they needed more security but were turned down. \nOn September 9, Stevens met with Islamic militia leaders in Benghazi. They warned there had been threats against Americans by extremists in Benghazi. They also told the ambassador he and his group should leave as \"soon as possible\". But they also said they wanted American investments in Libya. They asked how soon Benghazi could get a McDonald's and a KFC. \nDay of the attack.\nOn September 11, several hours before the attack started, Stevens sent a message to the State Department warning the situation was getting worse. Later, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was not aware of what was happening at the time. The reason she gave is the State Department receives more than a million messages a year. After the attack started, a rescue team (called the commander\u2019s \"In-extremis\" Force) started getting ready. But the ambassador was dead before the team was ready to leave Italy. After the attack 30 or more Americans were evacuated from Benghazi.\nCIA in Benghazi.\nThere were five U.S. commandos stationed at the CIA base in Benghazi about a mile from the consulate. They heard the attack starting and got ready to go rescue the ambassador. But they said later, the CIA station chief stopped them from going and told them to stay with the CIA. They also received a radio message from the consulate \u201cIf you guys do not get here, we are going to die!\u201d The CIA later stated they were trying to get local Libyan militia to go help the consulate. But they also said they did not prevent the commandos from rescuing the consulate members. \nAfter the attack.\nAmerican troops and law enforcement captured Ahmed Abu Khattala on June 15, 2014. He is the suspected ringleader of the group who carried out the attack. Other suspects also had sealed charges filed against them.\nOn May 8, 2014, the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi was formed to investigate the attack. The chairman of the committee is Representative Trey Gowdy from South Carolina."}

{"id": "510353", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=510353", "title": "Suspect", "text": "A suspect is a person believed to have done something wrong, committed a crime or caused something bad to happen. In criminal law a person who is under suspicion or under investigation by law enforcement is considered a suspect. A prime suspect is believed by police to be the suspect who most probably committed a crime. A formal suspect may be arrested when the facts and circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe a suspect may have committed a crime or is about to. In common law countries a suspect may have a defense attorney present while being questioned. The attorney may advise his or her client (the suspect) how to answer questions. Once a suspect is charged with a crime he or she becomes a defendant.\nQuestioning a suspect.\nCommon law countries.\nIn the past in common law countries, a suspect could not be questioned against their will. In the United Kingdom, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, police can require suspects to be questioned. Suspects are now required to listen to all questions, but may legally refuse to answer a question. In the UK once a suspect has been formally charged, no questions may be asked. In France, however, a suspect may still be questioned after being charged. The suspect may still legally refuse to answer any question. In the United States, once a suspect becomes the prime suspect, they must be advised of their Miranda rights before they can be questioned. Then they may be formally questioned, with a defence attorney present if the suspect requests one.\nCivil law countries.\nIn civil law countries a suspect may be questioned by police and the judiciary. This is to decide if there is enough evidence against a subject to bring the suspect to trial. There are three phases to the investigation. The first phase is a suspect is questioned by police. In the second phase the suspect is questioned by a magistrate (called a \"juge d'instruction\" in France). The third phase is the trial conducted by a state prosecutor in front of a panel of judges or magistrates. Then, if the investigation trial shows a case is strong enough, it is brought before a tribunal for trial.\nTerms confused with suspect.\nPerson of interest.\nA person of interest is a non-legal term for someone police may be interested in. In some cases a person of interest may simply be someone who has information related to an investigation or could be a witness. Police may be suspicious of someone, but do not have enough evidence to justify calling them a suspect. Sometimes police also misuse the term 'person of interest' to mean the suspect. Another use of the term is by writers meaning simply an interesting person.\nPerpetrator.\nPolice and reporters sometimes misuse the term suspect to mean the perpetrator. A suspect is someone \"suspected\" of committing a crime. A perpetrator (slang \"perp\") is a person who actually committed a crime. Good police work will eliminate suspects until they find the perpetrator (also called a culprit). \nIn the US and England, police have broad powers to arrest and detain suspects. In Canada police supposedly do not have that power. In a crime that gets a lot of publicity, police will sometimes detain a suspect for a period of time, then release them with no charges filed. Somehow the news media is informed of the release and a swarm of reporters and paparazzi are there to take pictures for next day's tabloids. Generally this is for a day or two in England. In the US it can be up to 72 hours. This process encourages the public to think of suspects as guilty, trusting the police would not arrest innocent people. This is sometimes called \"rounding up the usual suspects\". Sometimes police will call a suspect a perpetrator or person of interest and question them without giving a Miranda warning. This is a technicality since in the US police are required to give a Miranda warning if arresting a suspect. If after arresting and then questioning a suspect, police may decide they have the perpetrator. Then they will hand the case over to the district attorney."}

It was built in 1933 by Heinrich Himmler. The original purpose was to hold political prisoners. Dachau camp was located on the grounds of an old munitions factory. It was southeast of the medieval town of Dachau, about northwest of Munich in the state of Bavaria, in southern Germany. \nThe camp's purpose was enlarged to include forced labor and housed ordinary German and Austrian criminals. Eventually foreign nationals from countries that Germany occupied or invaded were sent here. It became a death camp for Jews. Countless thousands of Jews died were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork. The Dachau camp system grew to include nearly 100 sub-camps. These were mostly work camps or \"Arbeitskommandos,\" and were located throughout southern Germany and Austria. The camps were liberated by U.S. forces in the spring of 1945.\nCamp statistics.\nEstimates of the number of people who died here vary widely. Complete records of how many died at Dachau do not exist. Three weeks before the United States Army reached the camp, most of the important records were removed or burned. A few days before the Americans arrived, Germans began evacuating prisoners. But poor organization prevented all from being removed. Prisoners from the Buchenwald concentration camp had been sent to Dachau. When the last train was found, 2,000 of the 4,000 prisoners on it were dead. Between 1933 and the liberation by Americans in 1945, about 228,930 prisoners had been sent to Dachau. This includes about 7,000 who had just arrived from Buchenwald.

Most of them are in a controlled orbit, so the flares from these satellites can be predicted. Computer programs can be fed the satellite's information and can predict a flare to an observer's location. The iridium satellite is known for having a weird shape. It has three door-sized antennas that occasionally reflects sunlight back to Earth. These can be very bright. So much so, that it can even be seen during the day. This annoys astronomers because it disrupts their observations."}

As of 2005, 94% of the people in Friesland understand West Frisian, 74% can speak it, 75% can read it and 27% can write it.\nAlphabet and grammar.\nWest Frisian uses the Latin alphabet. A,E,O and U can sometimes have unique accents added to them.\nIn Western Frisian, there are two types of genders that nouns can have. One is the \"common\" gender (where both the male and female genders are put together). The other type is a neutral gender noun.\nLike many other languages, West Frisian has singular and plural nouns. The two main suffixes used in the language, are \"\"-(e)n\" and \"-s\".\"\nWest Frisian also used three types of verbs: weak, strong and irregular.\nStatus.\nAfter a series of riots by pro-Frisian activists, West Frisian became an official language in the Netherlands in 1956.\nWest Frisian is a required subject in schools in Friesland. Courts in Friesland speak West Frisian. People in court are allowed to go under oath speaking West Frisian.\nSimilarity to English.\nWest Frisian is often considered as the closest language to modern English. Here is an example:\nText in West Frisian :\nDis dei is goed oeral. De sinne is waarm en de licht fan de sinne-skinen fielen goed wit de myld wyn. Juster elke was goed, buten dis dei is better. De sinne-opgong en de sinne-undergong is moai wit de blew lofts. Buten dis dei is lyket de maaitiid en net de simmertiid. Ik find dit dei de best of de wike.

Yesterday also was good, but this day is better. The sunrise and the sunset is beautiful with the blue sky. But this day is like the springtime and not the summertime. I find this day the best of the week. The rain is coming for the weekend for Saturday and Sunday morning, but it will not be cold and will go over us by the midday.

It was first released for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, for Android and iOS in 2017, then macOS in 2019. It is also the default browser for Windows 10 Mobile. Edge replaced Internet Explorer as the default browser on Windows 10. Internet Explorer 11 will remain available alongside Edge on Windows 10 for compatibility purposes.\nEdge connects with Microsoft's online platforms, with the help of Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant. Cortana provides voice control, search functionality, and personalized information. Edge also has a \"Reading List\" function to sync content between devices. It has a \"Reading Mode\" that makes reading websites easier. Edge has extensions hosted on the Microsoft Store.\nAs of April 2019, according to StatCounter, Edge still has lower market share than Internet Explorer and even with the market share of the both combined would only manage 3rd place after Firefox.\nHistory.\nWhile Edge was originally built with Microsoft's own technologies (\"engines\"), it was rebuilt as a Chromium-based browser (for better compatibility with Google Chrome, also built on Chromium, and its extensions). As part of this big change, Microsoft intended to add support for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, macOS, and Linux.\nFeatures.\nMicrosoft Edge is the default web browser on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, and Xbox One consoles, replacing Internet Explorer 11 and Internet Explorer Mobile. As its development and release is dependent on the model of \"Windows as a service\", it is not included in Windows 10 Enterprise Long-term servicing branch (LTSB) builds.\nFavorites, reading list, browsing history and downloads are viewed at the Hub, a sidebar providing functionality similar to Internet Explorer's Downloads manager and Favorites Center.\nThe browser still includes (while being phased out) an integrated Adobe Flash Player (with an internal whitelist allowing Flash applets on Facebook websites to load automatically, bypassing all other security controls requiring user activation) and a PDF reader. It also supports asm.js.\nEdge does not support legacy technologies such as ActiveX and Browser Helper Objects, and instead uses an extension system. Internet Explorer 11 remains available alongside Edge on Windows 10 for compatibility; it remains nearly identical to the Windows 8.1 version and does not use the Edge engine as was previously announced.\nEdge integrates with Microsoft's online platforms in order to provide voice control, search functionality, and dynamic information related to searches within the address bar. Users can make annotations to web pages that can be stored to and shared with OneDrive, but can't save HTML pages to their own computers. It also integrates with the \"Reading List\" function and provides a \"Reading Mode\" that strips unnecessary formatting from pages to improve their legibility.\nEdgeHTML.\nEdgeHTML is a proprietary layout engine developed for Edge. It is being phased out.\nDevelopment.\nEdgeHTML (2014\u20132019).\nIn December 2014, writing for \"ZDNet\", technology writer Mary Jo Foley reported that Microsoft was developing a new web browser codenamed \"Spartan\" for Windows 10. She said that \"Spartan\" would be treated as a new product separate from Internet Explorer, with Internet Explorer 11 retained alongside it for compatibility.\nIn November 2017, Microsoft released ports of Edge for Android and iOS. The apps feature integration and synchronization with the desktop version on Windows 10 PCs. Due to platform restrictions and other factors, these ports do not use the same layout engine as the desktop version, and instead use OS-native Webkit-based engines.\nIn April 2018, Edge added tab audio muting. In June 2018, support for the Web Authentication specifications were added to Windows Insider builds, with support for Windows Hello and external security tokens.\nChromium (2019\u2013present).\nOn December 6, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to base Edge on the Chromium source code, using the same rendering engine as Google Chrome but with enhancements developed by Microsoft. It was also announced that there will be versions of Edge available for Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and macOS, and that all versions will be updated on a more frequent basis. The initial release of the Chromium-based Edge, for desktops, is expected in the fall of 2019.\nOn April 8, 2019, the first Chromium-based builds of Edge for Windows were released to the public.\nOn May 20, 2019, the first Chromium-based preview builds of Edge for macOS were released to the public, marking the first time in 13 years that a Microsoft browser was available on the Mac platform. The last time a Microsoft browser was available on the Mac platform was Microsoft Internet Explorer for the Mac, which was withdrawn in January, 2006.\nReception.\nMicrosoft's planned switch to Chromium as Edge's engine has faced mixed reception. The move will increase consistency of web platform compatibility between major browsers, and for this reason, the move has attracted criticism, as it reduces diversity in the overall web browser market, and increases the influence of Google (developer of the Blink layout engine) on the overall browser market by Microsoft ceding its independently developed browser engine."}

It is in San Diego County, California next to Oceanside, San Clemente, Cleveland National Forest, Orange County, Riverside County and Fallbrook. The base is 125,000 acres (506 km2).\nPendleton is split into two areas, North and South. It was created in 1942 to train troops during World War II. By October 1944, Camp Pendleton was called a long-lasting base. Pendleton became the home of the 1st Marine Division. The base was named after World War I Major General Joseph Henry Pendleton (1860\u20131942). Today it is home to many units including the I Marine Expeditionary Force.\nHistory.\nBefore World War II.\nThe area that is now known as Camp Pendleton was explored by the Spanish, and many missions were created in the area. The most famous one is Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, which is in modern-day Oceanside (just 1.5 miles south of Camp Pendleton). The area was also owned by farmers, and a successful cattle industry was run by a wealthy British landowner named John (Don Juan) Forster.\nIn 1914 Pendleton was assigned to Camp Howard, North Island, San Diego. Right away he saw the value of the area's good weather and harbor. He lobbied Congress and Marine Corps Headquarters for a permanent Marine base on the West Coast.\nWorld War II.\nIn the early 1940s, both the United States Army and United States Marine Corps were looking for a large base. The Army stopped caring about the project. The Marine Corps announced on February 1942 that the Camp Pendleton area would become the largest Marine Corps base in America. They purchased Rancho Santa Margarita las Flores for $4,239,062. Because the base was at first considered to be a temporary base, the buildings were built to minimum standards. The base was then mainly used for training.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

In the summer, they also go along the river bank and on the plaza. Cats have been guarding the museum for more than 200 years, since the Tsars ruled Russia. In earlier times, they roamed freely through all the museum galleries.\nIn 2010, Maria Haltunen (\"Khaltunin\" in Russia), who directs the museum's cat program, said that there were 60 cats on the museum grounds. The museum staff joked that officially the museum is only supposed to have 50 cats.\nIn May 2013, the count had grown to 74 cats, of both sexes, Haltunen said. (All have been \"fixed\" so they can't have kittens). There are kitchens for cooking their food (\"they all have different preferences\"), and even a small hospital.\nDonations, charity gifts and sponsorship from a cat food company pay for the care of the cats.\nHistory.\nThe cats have been in the museum, that was once a palace, since the 18th century. In 1774, Empress Elizabeth of Russia gave an order for cats to come live in the palace to control the mice population. James Rodgers of the BBC said it is thought that the cats first came from Kazan, a city known for having cats good at catching mice. The cats stayed in St. Petersburg except during World War II, when the existing cat population was killed. After the war, a new group of cats was brought in because the rat population had increased.\nIn the 1990s Haltunen began a program to actively take care of the cats. Before this, they had lived in poor conditions.\nBeginning in 2007, the museum adopts cats needing homes. The cats are an attraction for tourists.\nIn 2011, the museum began a \"Catfest\", a celebration of its cat population. \"Catfest\" has cat painting contests and games for children."}

The bruise harms the capillaries, and then blood and other liquids collect in the lungs. These extra liquids prevent with gas exchange. Without gas exchange, oxygen levels drop (hypoxia). If the lung is cut, then the injury is instead a pulmonary laceration and has different symptoms.\nA lung contusion is usually caused by blunt trauma. Explosion injuries or a shock wave from a penetrating trauma may also cause this injury.\nDoctors began studying this injury after explosives hurt soldiers in World Wars I and II. In the 1960s when cars became popular people began to get this kind of injury from car accidents.\u00a0\nClassification.\nLung contusion and laceration are injuries to the lung. In contusion, the structure of the lung does not change. In laceration, the pieces of lung may be moved. When blood fills lacerations, the injury is called pulmonary hematoma. The difference between a contusion and a hematoma is that in a contusion, the alveoli (tiny air-filled sacs that give oxygen) will bleed, but a hematoma is a blood clot.\nIf the\u00a0pleural cavity (the space outside the lung) accumulates blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) or both (hemopneumothorax) then this is called a collapsed lung. These conditions do not always damage the lung but they might, or they might be the result of damage. Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may happen with lung injuries. Chest wall injuries include rib fractures and flail chest. In flail chest multiple ribs are broken move independently of the rib cage.\nCauses.\nPulmonary contusion is the most common injury found in blunt chest trauma, occurring in 25\u201335% of cases. It is usually caused by a collision while moving quickly. About 70% of cases result from motor vehicle collisions, most often when the chest strikes the inside of the car. Falls, assaults, and sports injuries are other causes. Pulmonary contusion can also be caused by explosions. The organs most harmed by blast injuries are those that hold gas, such as the lungs. Blast lung is severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding, or edema with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. This is the usual cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion. Unlike other causes of injury in which pulmonary contusion is often found with other injuries, explosions can cause pulmonary contusion without damage to the chest wall."}

This effort was not successful. Neither a principality, autonomous State, or autonomous district ever actually came into existence in 1917. All these events lasted only a few days. One of the members of the temporary committee that wanted to form a government for this district was the young Alcibiades Diamandi, an ethnic-Aromanian who played a significant role 25 years later in 1941-43.\nThe name \"Principality of the Pindus\" was used later to describe a similar idea which was discussed by members of the \"Roman Legion\" (1941-1943).

Demolition is different from deconstruction, which is carefully taking a building apart to reuse its parts. \nFor small buildings, such as houses, demolition is often simple. Buildings are often pulled down with excavators, bulldozers or small cranes. Other specialized equipment may also be used. Larger buildings may use a wrecking ball swung by a crane. This works well for masonry buildings. Sometimes building implosion is used. This involves using carefully placed explosive charges. If done correctly, the building falls in on itself and not on nearby buildings.\nPreparation.\nBefore a building can be torn down, several things have to happen. A demolition permit has to be obtained from a city, town or county. All hazardous waste must be removed. This includes asbestos, lead paint and any flammable materials. All utilities (water, electricity and natural gas) have to be disconnected. Many municipalities have checklists of what to do before a building can be demolished. They also have checklists of things that must be removed first."}

Many countries have laws to protect the public which means that the directors of a company who continue to trade whilst the company is insolvent may have to pay compensation to creditors, and in some cases may even be convicted of a crime."}

It is usually hung from a crane. A crane operator swings the ball back and forth like a pendulum. It works best tearing down masonry buildings. Early round shapes would sometimes get stuck in walls and roofs. The modern wrecking ball is pear-shaped to avoid this problem. It is not clear when the wrecking ball was invented. They were commonly in use by 1936 in New York City. Today they are no longer used as much in demolition. The wrecking ball has largely been replaced by the more efficient High reach excavator. \"Think of a long-reach excavator as a demolition scalpel, compared to the mallet of a wrecking ball\".\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}
