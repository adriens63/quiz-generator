Gambling was permitted, and masters served their slaves. A common custom was the election of a \"King of the Saturnalia\". The poet Catullus called it \"the best of days\"."}

The valley is one of the Earth's largest calderas, the result of a gigantic volcanic explosion. The valley is about long (east-west), wide (north-south), and up to deep.\nLong Valley formed 760,000 years ago when a supervolcanic eruption released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area. The eruption emptied the magma chamber under the area to the point of collapse. The second phase of the eruption released pyroclastic flows that burned and buried thousands of square miles. Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the western part of what is now the United States. It is not expected to explode again in such a manner.\nThe explosion released 600 cubic kilometres (140 cu mi) of material from vents inside the margin of the caldera. By way of comparison, the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption released 1.2 cubic kilometres (0.29 cu mi). \nIn April 2006, three members of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area ski patrol died while on duty. All three died from suffocation by carbon dioxide when they fell into a fumarole on the slopes of the mountain while attempting to fence it off."}

He said that Man does not live by bread alone, but by the words that come from the Father's (God's) mouth. The devil then told Jesus to jump off the highest part of the Temple to show his power, since the Bible said that God would send angels to save Him. Jesus replied that the Bible also says not to \"test the Lord your God\". Then the Devil offered to give Jesus all of the World's kingdoms if Jesus would worship him. Jesus replied that we should worship only God. \nAll three temptations are recorded in each of the three Synoptic Gospels. But the order in which they were told is different between the accounts.

It was the first movie directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.\nPlot.\nMonica Wright and Quincy McCall have wanted to be professional basketball players since they were kids. Monica has wanted to play for the Los Angeles Lakers and wear Magic Johnson's number 32. Quincy has wanted to be like his father and wear number 22. But Monica has to work hard to establish herself. Quincy was born with natural star potential. As the two fight hard to reach their goals of playing professionally, they must also deal with their emotions for each other.\nThe first quarter of the story begins around 1981, when Monica and her family moved to Los Angeles from Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly became friends with their new neighbors, the McCalls. Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly. They share a love for the game: basketball. Quincy is shocked that a girl could \"ever\" love basketball as much as he did. And he's even more shocked when Monica plays so well. In the first interaction, Quincy angrily knocks her down during game point and scars her face. But the next day, they share their first kiss on the first day of school. They end the first quarter of the story by fighting in the grass.\nThe second quarter of the story begins in 1988. Both Monica and Quincy are the respective leaders of their high school teams. Scouts have taken clear notice of Quincy. Many see him as one of the top prospects in the country. He was very popular on the court and with the other students. He could have any girl he wanted. But he is still good friends and neighbors with Monica.\nMonica, though, has problems with her fiery emotions on the court. This has often resulted in many technical fouls during critical moments of games, being benched and eventually pushing away lots of potential scouting chances due to her lack of control. Aside from her emotions on the court, Monica also has problems with the emotions she still secretly has for Quincy. She has a hard time expressing them because he is always surrounded by other girls. Monica also has problems with her mother Camille, who is a stay at home wife and mother. From the time she was a little girl, Monica has been pressured by her mother to give up basketball and act like a lady. This leads to the point where Camille has forced Monica to wear dresses and skirts against her will. It has continued into her high school years, when Camille still complains that Monica is too much of a tomboy and needs to learn to be more female. This causes Monica to feel hurt and hateful toward her mother for not accepting who she is.\nThe third quarter of the story follows Quincy and Monica to their freshman year at the University of Southern California in 1988-1989. At this point they are managing themselves as athletes, students and a couple. However, the same problems seem to show themselves, only this time on a bigger stage. Quincy finds instant success on the basketball court, and more female admirers. But Monica struggles for playing time. She's the backup to the USC's senior guard, Sidra O'Neal. Making matters worse, she falls on the bad side of the head coach, Ellie Davis. Davis reprimands Monica for showing off and for lack of defense. Monica's relationship to Quincy becomes more difficult.\nThe movie later concludes at 1998. Monica has finally gone pro in the Women's National Basketball Association. The WNBA was created a couple years earlier in the 1990s. The movie ends with Quincy and Monica's toddler daughter cheer Monica on during one of her games.\nRelease.\nThis movie was released on April 21, 2000 in the United States.\nReception.\nReviews.\nThe movie got generally favorable reviews from movie critics. At Metacritic, it got an average score of 70. \nRotten Tomatoes puts the movie's rating at 82%.\nBox office.\nThe movie was released in North America to 1,237 theaters. It took in $3,176,000 on its first day. It took in $27,728,118 worldwide. The budget was near $20 million."}

Colour theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490).\nThe foundations of pre-20th-century colour theory were built around \"pure\" or ideal colours, as sensory experiences rather than the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in the colour theory principles.\nThere is a difference between the behaviour of light mixtures, called additive color mixing, and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called subtractive color mixing. The absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.\nA second problem is the failure to describe the important effects of strong light. The appearance of colours reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) is not the same as mixed colours of light. \"Colours\" such as browns or ochres cannot appear in mixtures of light. A strong lightness contrast between a mid-valued yellow paint and a surrounding bright white makes the yellow appear to be green or brown, while a strong brightness contrast between a rainbow and the surrounding sky makes the yellow in a rainbow appear to be a fainter yellow, or white.\nAnother problem is the tendency to describe colour too simply, for example as a contrast between \"yellow\" and \"blue\". Most colour effects are due to contrasts on the attributes that define all colours:\nThus, the visual impact of \"yellow\" vs. \"blue\" hues in visual design depends on the relative lightness and saturation of the hues.\nMany colour theorists have said that three \"pure\" primary colours can mix \"all possible colours\". They think any failure of paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colourants. But any three real \"primary\" colours of light, paint or ink can mix only a limited range of colours, which is always smaller than the full range of colours we can see."}

It is mostly done when shark is still alive. The sharks are sometimes thrown back to the ocean after removing their fins but they are still alive. since they are unable to swim properly, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and die of suffocation or are eaten by other predators. Shark finning at sea helps fishing vessels in increasing their profit. It also helps to increase the number of sharks harvested, as they only have to store and transport the fins, which is the most profitable part of the shark; the shark meat is bulky to transport. Some countries have banned this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port before removing the fins.\nShark finning increased since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins. It is used in shark fin soup and traditional cures, particularly in China and its territories. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Shark Specialist Group say that shark fin trade is causing a serious danger to the shark population. It estimates of the global value of the shark fin trade range from US$540\u00a0million to US$1.2\u00a0billion (2007). Shark fins are among the most expensive seafood products, commonly sold at US$400\u00a0per\u00a0kg. In the United States, where finning is not allowed, some buyers regard the whale shark and the basking shark as trophy species, and pay $10,000 to $20,000 for a fin."}

Together with V\u00e4ino Tamm, he has been one of the most important interior architects and representer of modernist interiors in Estonia since the late 1950s.\nYouth and education.\nBorn in Vana-Saaluse village in Saaluse rural municipality, V\u00f5rumaa. Bother parents were from V\u00f5rumaa, mother was a farmer and father was a craftsman.\nInterest in arts started already in high school, where he began to design school wallpapers and leaflets. Even though his parents wanted him to continue studies in medecine at the University of Tartu, he decided to study interior architecture at . He graduated from V\u00f5ru Secondary School No. 1 in 1948 and began studying at ERKI from the same year.\nA significant part of his university projects is made up of copying historic furniture drawings. They were mostly made at the and the Peeter I\u00a0 House Museum in Kadriorg. Interior and furniture design projects were also made for a cabin, a clubhouse, a small apartment. His graduation work was interior design for the hall of Tallinn Polytechnic Institute.\nWork experience.\nFrom 1954-55, he worked in Tallinn at the national architecture design studio \"\". In the studio Asi`s tasks were primarily drawing architectural details, sections, plans and coloring them. \nSubsequently, he worked in the ARS institute from 1956-1964. During those years he completed several museum exhibition designs and he also belonged to the team of interior architects who in 1954-61 made a new interior design for the Estonian Pavilion of the USSR Economic Achievements Exhibition in Moscow. After working in ARS Vello Asi continued creating exhibition designs in Estonia, as well in Moscow, London, Ulaanbaatar. In addition to interior architecture, he also did graphic design and book design, most of which consists of designing Jaan Kross's books and several architecture related books.\nHis most important works express rationality and tectonic clarity: the Kurtna poultry farm (1967), the offices of the Writers' House in Tallinn (1963), the Tuljak (1967) and Tallinn cafes (1967-69), Karolina bar (1968; the last three with V\u00e4ino Tamm), the Radio House studio (1965-77, with H. Oruve), the Viru hotel(1972, with V. Tamme and L. Raudsep, N\u00f5uk, Estonian prize ) and interiors of the Pirita Marine Center Yacht Club and Press Center (1980).\nOne of his early career`s most important works are the Tallinn Writers' House offices (1963), most significantly the hall with the black ceiling. This was his minimalist and severe reaction to the existing 1950s official style that was more theatrical and festive. Although some have associated the black color with a strong symbolic shadow, Asi has acclaimed he chose the color primarily for practical reasons - to hide holes and dents of the ceiling. However, he was obliged to go to Moscow in order to justify the color choice as the bosses in Tallinn did not dare to give their signature to the project. In addition to the hall, Asi designed in the Writers' House the cabinets and its furniture.\nCollaboration with V\u00e4ino Tamm.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 An important part of his work was born in collaboration with the interior designer and university schoolmate V\u00e4ino Tamm. Together they created interior design for Valve Pormeister's architectural masterpieces - the cafe Tuljak and the Kurtna Poultry Farm Testing building. The patron of both buildings was Edgar T\u00f5nurist. He wished that the Tuljak Cafe (1967) would be a self-service brasserie, with a terrace for barbecue and a terrace with fireplaces. The interior of the cafe had a long table along the wall and the room was filled with wood furniture.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 T\u00f5nurist was also the patron for the main building of the Kurtna Poultry Farm Testing building, designed by Valve Pormeister. The interior design by Tamm and Asi is based on the architecture and complements it. Modernist interior design is important in the interior: furniture is not designed as a single object but rather as an architectural space element.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the 1960's, the life of the Old Town of Tallinn became active and new cafes and restaurants were born. Tamm and Asi designed several new cafes in Tallinn`s Old Town: Varietee and cafe Tallinn, wine bar Karoliina, and the restaurant Gloria. The Tallinn cafe (1967-1969) was located on the first floor of Harju Street 6, the Varietee stayed on the second floor. The cafe was filled with the no. 14 Thonet chairs. Tamm and Asi designed tables and a long banquet. The outdoor terrace was in the green area of \u200b\u200bHarju Street. The Karolina Bar was designed in the former defensive fortress at the Freedom Square.\nTamm and Asi also made together the interiors for Tallinn's new Radio House, the new P\u00e4rnu theater, and the Tartu Vanemuine theater. The most important project was the (Henno Sepmann, Mart Port, 1972). Besides Tamm and Asi, the project was made by Loomet Raudsepp, Taevo Gans and Mait Summatavet. The most important feature of the interior architecture was its perfect harmony with exterior architecture. There was a similar use of materials and simple surfaces both indoors and outdoors. The vestibule was designed by Asi who covered the walls and floors with a dark ceramic tile. The furniture can be characterized by strict geometric volumes that are in perfect harmony with the shape of the room.\nThe design of the Tallinn Ol\u00fcmpia-Purjespordikeskus (Regati pst. 1) was led by V\u00e4ino Tamm in 1975-80. The design tasks were divided between the interior architects team (Tamm, Asi, Aulo Padar, Juta Lember, Leo Leesaar). Vello Asi designed the dining room (with Leo Leesaare), the yacht club and the press section."}

{"id": "636184", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=636184", "title": "Lake Maracaibo", "text": "Lake Maracaibo () is a large brackish tidal bay (or tidal estuary) in Venezuela. It is an \"inlet of the Caribbean Sea\". It is often called a lake rather than a bay or lagoon. In the north, a channel 55 km long connects it to the Carribean Sea. \nThe lake is named after the city Maracaibo, which lies on the east side of this channel. In Maracaibo, this channel is about 8.5 km wide. General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge spans this channel. It is one of the longest bridges in the world. \nThe lake has a size of about by . 135 rivers flow into the lake. The biggest of them is Catatumbo River, which is 500km long. Others include Escalante River and Chama River. \nIn the northern part of the lake, there is brackish water. The southern part of the lake is freshwater. There are many islands in the lake.\nEconomic importance.\nIn most parts of the lake, the water is very shallow. For this reason, a canal has been built, so that oceangoing ships are able to access the ports of Maracaibo and Cabimas. \nIn 1914, crude oil was found in the lake, near Cabimas. The surrounding Maracaibo Basin contains large reserves of it; the lake is a major profit center for Venezuela. Almost a quarter of Venezuela's population live in the basin around the lake. \nThunderstorms.\nLake Maracaibo is not very deep, on average, it only has a depth of . Its biggest depth is . Its water is very warm, usually . During the day, a lot of water evaporates from the lake. At night, the air around the lake cools down faster than the air over the lake. This leads ot the formation of clouds. Because of the difference in temperature, thunderstorms are frequent. Large flocks of cattle graze in the area around the lake. Very often, they are hit by lightning. Lightning may also hit one of the many oil extraction facilities in the lake, which often catch fire. \nThis weather phenomenon is known as Catatumbo lightning. It regularly occurs at Lake Maracaibo and produces more lightning than any other place on the planet. \nEnvironmental problems.\nThe environment of the lake has several problems. Part of the lake is infested with the duckweed \"Lemna\". Duckweed are plants that float freely on the water. The problem with \"Lemna\" is that it spreads very fast. Its cover of the water can double in 48 hours. The plants can only be removed physically. In mid 2004, about 18% of the lake was covered with it. \nDuckweed is not toxic to fish, but it takes oxygen out of the lake as it decays. This kills fish. Though officials say the weed has not harmed fish yet, it is harming the local fishing industry. The plant clogs the motors of small boats, making it impossible for fishers to launch their vessels. \nDuckweed also threatens the local ecosystem because it shades the lake: Other plants in the lake do not get enough light, and die off. In certain conditions, the weed may concentrate heavy metals and bacteria such as \"Salmonella\" and \"Vibrio cholerae\", the bacterium that causes cholera. Even though it causes many problems, the weed may also have some use: Duckweed can be treated to feed poultry, or to make paper. \nThe lake has other problems. Untreated sewage is released into it, and oil drilling operations cause pollution with crude oil."}

The race is sponsored by QuikTrip, along with the nonprofit organization Folds of Honor, and is run as the second race of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.\nThis race was originally Atlanta's second race of the season and was run as a late season event for much of its history. From 1987 until 2001, the race was scheduled in November as the final race of the NASCAR season. From 2002 until 2008, the race was moved to October in favor of awarding the final race weekend to Homestead-Miami Speedway and became part of what is now the NASCAR Chase for the Championship in 2004. In 2009, Atlanta swapped fall race dates with Auto Club Speedway and the race was moved to Labor Day weekend. From 2011 onward, this has been Atlanta's only race date as its spring race was moved to Kentucky Speedway and run later in the year.\nIn the most recent round of schedule changing, NASCAR elected to move the Labor Day weekend race back to Darlington Raceway, which hosted the Southern 500 on that weekend from 1950 until 2003, and moved Atlanta's lone date back to the early season.\nOverview.\nFrom 1987 until 2001, the race was scheduled as the final race of the NASCAR season, and thus was typically the event in which the champion was decided. Several times, however, the championship had already been clinched prior to this race, rendering the race anti-climactic. In some cases, the championship would be decided the moment the points leader took the green flag to start the race - effectively clinching enough championship points by finishing last or better.\nThe 1992 race marked the final race for Richard Petty, and coincidentally, the debut for Jeff Gordon. With six drivers eligible for the Winston Cup Championship, the race is widely regarded as one of the greatest NASCAR races of all time. Alan Kulwicki, who finished second in the race, edged out Bill Elliott, the race winner, by leading one more lap in the race. Kulwicki won the NASCAR Winston Cup title by a then-record margin of only 10 points.\nThe 1998 race was run mostly at night after a long rain delay; despite the inexperience with the lights, newly installed for an Indy Racing League race, NASCAR and the teams agreed to attempt finishing the race at night. It was shortened to 221 laps because it was after 11:00\u00a0p.m. EST and NASCAR wanted to \"get the fans out at a decent hour\". The 1999 Cracker Barrel 500 also ended at night. This would mark a springboard of sorts at finishing delayed races at night by utilizing a track's permanent lighting system.\nIn 2001, the race was scheduled as the season finale, however, it ended up being the second-to-last race. The New Hampshire 300 was postponed from September 16 to the Friday after Thanksgiving, due to 9/11. Beginning in 2002 the race was moved to mid-October as NASCAR elected to hold its final race at Homestead-Miami Speedway instead of Atlanta. The 2003 race started a tradition of night qualifying at Atlanta, which has carried over to the spring race as well.\nIn 2006, the race start time was changed from 12:40\u00a0p.m. EDT to 2:55\u00a0p.m. EDT in order to finish the race at night. Driver complaints erupted because of the track's troublesome situation where the sun can get into the driver's eyes in Turn 1, including leading to a crash during the time the sun sets in that area of the track between Jeff Gordon and Jamie McMurray, led to the abandonment of the 3\u00a0PM start after this race.\nIn 2009, the race was moved Labor Day weekend as part of a realignment agreement with Auto Club Speedway, which had received the Labor Day weekend race in 2004, and Talladega Superspeedway, where Talladega's fall race moved to the Atlanta race weekend and Fontana received a race in the Chase in Talladega's spot.\nIn 2015, Atlanta's lone race date moved to the second week of the season in early March, with the Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway returning to its traditional Labor Day weekend date. Atlanta will be run on a Sunday afternoon. This event used to be called the Oral-B USA 500, and this event used to be aired on ESPN for 6 years preceding the Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway and the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond International Raceway\nRealignment.\nThis race, Atlanta's second of the season, had been rumored to be either eliminated or moved several times in recent years. Most recently, track owner Bruton Smith, president of Speedway Motorsports, Inc., was talking with International Speedway Corporation about a possible date switch with one of its tracks. On February 29, 2008, Smith proposed a move that involved the fall Atlanta race and the Pepsi 500, the Labor Day weekend race held at Auto Club Speedway. Doing so gave the Fontana, California track a race in the Chase for the Championship as well as return the Labor Day weekend race to the southern U.S. for the first time since the second-to-last Southern 500 was run. It also makes the three races that precede the beginning of the Chase closer to each other geographically. Prior to the realignment, the teams raced in the Sharpie 500 at Bristol the week before Labor Day, then traveled cross country for the Pepsi 500, then came back across the country to run the Chevy Rock &amp; Roll 400 at Richmond the following Saturday.\nUltimately, NASCAR adjusted the schedule as announced on August 19, 2008 to allow the fall race at Atlanta and the Chase event to Fontana to be swapped, but also in the process moved the AMP Energy 500 at Talladega Superspeedway to Atlanta's old date\u00a0\u2014 usually the last weekend in October\u00a0\u2014 and the aforementioned Pepsi 500 was placed in the old Talladega date, the first weekend in October beginning in 2009."}

There he graduated from secondary school in 1944, after which he started to attempt architecture studies at Tallinn Polytehnic Institute, these studies remained short-temp. He commenced studies in autumn of 1945 at Tallinn State Institute of Applied Arts in the specialty of spatial and furniture design. Looking back, he has confirmed that the teachings of two great men - Kuusik and Velbri - were a very efficient mis in acquiring professional skills. Tomberg's teaching career at the institute began in 1949, when Kuusik trusted him the position of an assistant at the chair and his primary task were to supervise project graphics. Later he also helped with general composition lectures and practical trainings. In 1950 Tomberg graduated from the department as interior architect (Photograph from the graduation). His participation in teaching decreased for a while, when the Chair of Spatial and Furniture Design was temporarily closed. Thereafter, he worked for eight years at the design studio of the ARS art manufacture, mainly designing various interiors. After the restoration of the Spatial Design Chair in 1964 he returned to teaching position and mostly supervised diploma theses. All together, he has supervised 62 theses.\nThe curriculum was updated and, along with artistic expression, the studies started to focus on functionality and steadfast logic related to the floorplans. Based on the tastes of the era, the Nordic countries, which were appealing for their crispness, awareness of materials and practicality, set the example. If we examine the student projects, we see that the graduates from the 1960s and 1970s represent the most daring, and extremely professional approach, that is, the projects that were completed while Tomberg, Tamm, Asi and P\u00e4rtelpoeg were on the faculty.\nThe talented and intelligent Bruno Tomberg was first seen as Kuusik and Velbri\u2019s successor; however, he started to be strongly attracted to design, and in 1966, established the respective department.\nThe Beginning of the Department of Design.\nIn 1966 Bruno Tomberg put together the Design Chair at the art institute. The first students of industrial art began their studies in the autumn of 1966, under the aegis of the Department of Interior and Furniture Design, using their facilities, resources and to some extent even their professors. Structurally, they were part of the Faculty of Architecture. \u00a0\nThis discipline did not appear out of nowhere and without necessary preparations. According to Bruno Tomberg\u2019s memories, re received a proposition to assume leadership of the new subject from Vice Rector Peeter Tarvas. At the end of the 1950s, the need for the training of specialists was beginning to be appreciated in both Estonia and different centres of the Soviet Union.\nThe basis for and centre of the design curriculum was the architectonics programme developed by Tomberg, which proceeded from line and surface to three-dimensional structures. This was inspired by 20th-century modernism. The assignments grew more complex over time, starting with a simple everyday object and progressing to complete environments.\nIn 1970, Tomberg emphasised: \u2018\u2019The Institute considers it necessary to supply the young artists of this discipline with maximum fantasy, to proceed from the assumption that nothing will limit the execution of their designs.\u2019\u2019\nIn 1982, Bruno Tomberg resigned his position as the head of the Department of Industrial Art and Associate Professor Udo Ivask took over. From 1988 to 1993, Tomberg was the Head of the Design Department. He has been a professor since 1979.\nSocial design idea.\nTomberg always thought about design from the social aspect. Soon, the idea of social design started to emerge along with global problems, such as pollution, the gap between the developed and the Third World, and Tomberg\u2019s leading principle: \u2018\u2019ethical credo\u2019\u2019. From the beginning, the students of design were filled with discontent of the status quo, a need to intervene, in belief in themselves and the knowledge that design could assist in solving social problems. Tomberg\u2019s passionate speeches did not leave anyone indifferent: the issues he raised and example he provided were etched into memory. His main ideas became more and more pronounced: \u2018\u2019Now that we have gotten to know design better with the students, I can see only one possible programme for the department: movement towards design supplemented by the moral, social and political responsibility that working in this discipline demands from the author.\u2019\u2019\nThe primary example among design schools was Bauhaus: both the teaching system and the ideas represented by this school caught interest.\nBruno Tomberg\u2019s phenomenon, at least in teaching, was based on his personal charisma: even though the unrealistic nature of his ideas was sense, the seriousness of his views was clear. The reputation of the department of design and high self-esteem of the design students, was strongly based on the passion and broad view that Tomberg represented. Although his writings are not particularly consistent theoretically, they still have a clear social message.\nSpace and Form.\nExhibition activity was also an important part of the development of the department of design. In parallel with the formation of the speciality at ERKI, the first three Space and Form exhibitions took place, which were curated by Tomberg, among others\nPersonal life.\nSicnce 1955 Bruno Tomberg is married to textile designer Mall Tomberg."}

They are kleptoparasites, a term which means parasitism by theft. In this case the theft is of food stored for the host larvae.\nFemales of cuckoo bees lack the special long hairs which collect pollen. Also, they do not make their own nests. They often have reduced body hair, thick exoskeleton, and saber-like mandibles.\nThey enter the nests of pollen-collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells made by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it eats the host larva's pollen ball. If the female has not already done so, it kills and eats the host larva. In a few cases the invading female stays in the host nest and lays many eggs. Sometimes it kills the host queen and replaces her. Species like that are often called 'social parasites'. Some are referred to as 'brood parasites'. There is a whole subfamily of bees which do this, the Nomadinae (nomad bees).\nThe behaviour has evolved many times in bees. 16 times parasitism of social species has evolved (mostly in the family Apidae), and there are 31 lineages which parasitize solitary bees. Altogether there are several thousand species of kleptoparasites, a large proportion of overall bee diversity."}

It is the easternomost atoll of Kiribati. The atoll is part of the Southern Line Islands. In total, the atoll consists of 39 islets(motus), which cover a surface (landmass) of about . The atoll covers an area of about \nIt was first sighted by Europeans in 1606, it was claimed by the United Kingdom in 1868. It has been part of the Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's independence in 1979. Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and is considered one of the world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.\nThe atoll is currently designated as a wildlife sanctuary. In 2014 the Kiribati government established a 12-nautical-mile fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands (Caroline (commonly called Millennium), Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck). Both Flint and wostok are about to the west. Papeete, Thahiti is about to the south.\nGeography.\nIt extends about from north to south, and about from east to west. The toal lanmass is just . The coral reef extends about out. The lagoon is very shallow, and normal boats usually cannot enter. At high tide, it is possible to reach a beach with a boat. At low tide, a walk of about in waist-deep water is required.\nIn the north and in the south, there are bigger islands. The one in the north is called Nake Island, the one in the south is called South Islands. Both have freshwater sources. There are aquifers on both. \nIn 1994, Kiribati changed the International date line, so that all of Kriibati would have the same date. This meant that Caroline atoll would be the first landmass on earth with the new date. Frr the year-2000 celebrations, the atoll was renamed Milennium island. Other names in the past have included \"Hirst Island\", \"Clark Island\" \"and Independence Island\".\nThe island is an importan breeding place for bird. The only known mammal on the atoll is a rat."}

He was the first person to introduce the architecture of Ancient Rome and the Italian Renaissance to Britain. His buildings were the first in Britain to employ Vitruvian rules of proportion and symmetry. He also made a major contribution as a theatre designer. He designed the scenery and costumes for many masques (a kind of early opera). \nLife.\nJones was born in the Smithfield district of London. His father, also called Inigo Jones, was a cloth worker from Wales. As a very young man, he as an apprentice carpenter at St Paul's Cathedral. Some time before 1603 a rich patron (possibly the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Rutland) sent him to Italy to study drawing. After Italy he travelled to Denmark where he worked for King Christian V on the designs for the king's Rosenborg and Frederiksborg palaces. When he returned to England he began work as a theatre designer and architect. In September 1615, King Charles I appointed Jones as the Surveyor-General of the King's Works. From 1629 to 1635 he worked for buildings in Covent Garden. \nJones's career as a full-time architect ended with the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642. The Parliament of England seized all of the King's houses in 1643. In his later years Jones lived in Somerset House in central London. He died there on 21 June 1652. He was buried with his parents at the Church of St Benet. St Benet's was the Welsh church of the City of London. "}

{"id": "636570", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=636570", "title": "Duckweed", "text": "Duckweed, water lens, or bayroot, are freshwater aquatic plants. They float in still or slow-moving fresh water and wetlands. There are five genera, with a total of 33 to 38 species.\nThese plants are very simple: They lack an obvious stem or leaves. Most of each plant is a small organized \"thallus\" or \"frond\" structure only a few cells thick. Often it has air pockets and floats on or under the water surface. Some have no root and some have one or more simple rootlets.\nReproduction is usually by asexual budding. Occasionally, three tiny flowers are produced for sexual reproduction. These flowers have two stamens and a pistil. From this occasional reproduction is produced a seed in an air bag that floats. The flower of the duckweed genus \"Wolffia\" is the smallest known, just 0.3\u00a0mm long. \nDuckweed ecology.\nGetting nutrients is a factor for aquatic plants. Duckweeds tend to be found in fertile, even eutrophic conditions. They can be spread by waterfowl and small mammals on their feet and bodies, and by moving water. In water with constant currents or overflow, the plants are carried down the water channels and do not grow so thickly. In some places, weather causes the plants to multiply greatly when water-flow is low. Then they are carried away as rainy periods follow.\nDuckweed is an important high-protein food source for waterfowl. It contains more protein than soybeans. The tiny plants provide cover for many small aquatic species. Pondwater species such as bullfrogs and fish such as bluegills use the plants as shelter. \nThe plants can provide nitrate removal, if cropped, and the duckweeds are important in the process of bioremediation because they grow rapidly, absorbing excess mineral nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphates. For these reasons, they are touted as water purifiers of untapped value.\nDuckweed may be used for wastewater treatment to capture toxins and for odor control. If a mat of duckweed is maintained for the removal of the toxins, it also prevents the development of algae and controls the breeding of mosquitoes. \nThese plants also may play a role in conservation of water because a cover of duckweed will reduce evaporation of water when compared to the rate of a similarly sized water body with a clear surface.\nResearch and applications.\nIn July 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute announced that the Community Sequencing Program funded sequencing of the genome of the giant duckweed, \"Spirodela polyrhiza\". This was a priority project for DOE in 2009. The research was intended to facilitate new biomass and bioenergy programs.\nDuckweed is a good candidate as a biofuel because it grows rapidly, produces five to six times as much starch as corn per unit of area, and does not contribute to global warming. Unlike fossil fuels, duckweed removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere instead of adding it.\nDuckweed filters out contaminants (bacteria, nitrogen, phosphates) from natural bodies of water, wetlands, and wastewater."}

The most famous artist was Nguy\u1ec5n H\u00f9ng L\u00e2n whose comics were popularly read (\"Hero Hesman\", \"Vietnamese supermen\", \"Vietnamese fairytales\"...). The content of these publications was broadly educational and offered lessons in moral philosophy for the reader. Many artists often \"borrowed\" international comics and animated films for imitating, as : \"Well just you wait\", \"Superman\", \"Jurassic park\", \"Tom and Jerry\", \"Charlot\"...\nEverything was to change in 1992 with the import of manga by Kim-\u0110\u1ed3ng and Youth. Since 1995 when the manga storm would really hit, suddenly Viet comics with educational and moral stories were overwhelmed and dull by comparison. Manga was able to engage with a broad readership and was readily available ; it saturated the market even though most was then illegally printed. That changed in 2004 when Vietnam finally signed an expanded version of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and copyright was discussed and respected. The management of sales and content of manga has since become strictly controlled.\nEra of Recession (2007 to now).\nDespite the \"invasion\" (called by 2000s Vietnames newspapers) of manga-manhwa-manhua fighting for a place in the Vietnamese market, 4 the rise of comics in a Vietnamese style was slow to gain pace given lingering prejudices, the feeling that comics were for children. Yet gradually, Vietnamese artists started to produce comics. In 2002, the Phan Th\u1ecb Company published the comic series titled \"Vietnamese child prodigies\" (Th\u1ea7n-\u0111\u1ed3ng \u0111\u1ea5t Vi\u1ec7t) and this was a turning point in Viet comics. It attracted many young readers and became a long-selling comic with more than 120 volumes produced. The comic might be considered similar to manga in panel layout and onomatopoeia (the formation of a word from a sound associated with what is named), and the style in which characters are drawn.\nMoreover, Youth Laughs Monthly, Hoa H\u1ecdc Tr\u00f2 Weekly and Truy\u1ec7n Tranh Tr\u1ebb Magazine (Youth Publishing House) also worked positively. They called Viet comics as \"m\u1ea1n h\u1ecda\" for dream about the comics compared \"triman\" (manga-manhwa-manhua)."}

The common name for this species is the eastern copperhead. It lives mainly on the eastern coast of North America and in the Mississippi drainage. They're common. Compared to others they're more likely to bite if they feel threatened. They're medium sized. One of the longest ones ever recorded measuring a little more than four feet long. The copperhead is venomous, but its venom is rarely fatal to humans.\nDescription.\nCopperhead snakes have reddish-brown bodies with a crossband pattern consisting of tan and copper. The average length adult copperheads is 76 cm in length. and are normally described as heavy-bodied snakes. Copperheads are sexually dimorphic. The head has a solid, rich brown color.

In the United States, it is found in Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Northern Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. In Mexico, it is found in Chihuahua and Coahuila.\nIt lives in many different types of habitats. In most of North America, it likes deciduous forest and mixed woodlands. During the winter, it hibernates in caves or in cracks in limestone. It is also found in coniferous forest. It is also found in the Chihuahuan Desert of West Texas and northern Mexico.\nDiet and predators.\nThe copperhead eats mainly rodents, especially mice. Sometimes it eats birds, other reptiles, even snakes, and amphibians. They also feed on some insects, a lot of times cicadas, because of their size that'll fill a copperhead up. They eat other animals, but they're not the apex predator around their habitat, Their natural predators include kingsnakes, water moccasins (also known as cottonmouths), bullfrogs, large birds of prey, coyotes, alligators, and a other predators.\nBehaviour.\nThe copperhead snake is active from March or April to early November in the northern part of its range. During the winter, they have been seen to basking on warm days in December and January. Even though copperheads have been seen hibernating by themselves they usually hibernate together.\nCopperheads are mainly active during the day in the spring and autumn. In the summer months, they become nocturnal to hunt during the evening.\nReproduction.\nThe copperhead snake breeds in late summer, but not every year. They give birth to their young ones alive. They usually give birth to four to seven young ones. The young ones are lighter in color, and with a yellowish-green-marked tip to the tail, which is used to lure lizards and frogs.\nVenom.\nEven though copperhead snakes are venomous, bites are almost never fatal. The symptoms of a bite from a copperhead snake is extreme pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling, and severe nausea.\nThe venom of the southern copperhead has been found to hold a protein called \"contortrostatin\" It stops the growth of cancer cells in mice and also stops the tumors from moving to other places in the body. However, further testing is needed to make sure that it is safe and efficient in humans.\nThe antivenom CroFab is used to treat copperhead bites that show symptoms. It is not given when there is no symptoms."}

Two years later, Shorvori gets pregnant and is accepted by Parth's family. However, an unfortunate accident results in a miscarriage, rendering Shorvori infertile. Parth and Shorvori keep the miscarriage hidden from the family, not wanting to ruin their happiness and contentment. Then enters their lives, Teni (Jasmin Bhasin), a carefree-outgoing-lively-bubbly Gujarati girl whom Parth and Shorvori select for surrogacy, in return of their promise to fulfill Teni's dream of going to America. Teni gets pregnant with Parth and Shorvori's child through IVF. Shorvori introduces Teni as her cousin to the family as she begins to live in Bhanushali house. Parth's aunt Poyni (Urvashi Upadhyay) with her daughter Sejal (Himani Sharma) doubt that Teni is hiding something and to be not related to Shorvori, given her ways and Gujarati dialect. Sejal tries to defame Teni in front of the family but in vain. Later, the family arranges for Teni's engagement, but she manages to call it off, proclaiming that she is already in a relationship with Parth's friend, Aman (Kunal Verma). Aman comes from the US on Dadaji's (Tej Sapru) insistence to get the situation clear but ends up falling in love with Teni at first sight and proposes marriage to Teni. Teni agrees, to fulfill her desire to get settled in America and live a financially secure life with her lover, Aman. Parth's family conducts a ritual for his and Shorvori's prospective child's welfare but on Shorvori's insistence, Teni sits in the puja with Parth as she is bearing the child. Teni wavers in her decision to marry Aman as she starts falling in love with Parth, the love that she realises as her impending marriage with Aman approaches, but decides to marry Aman for his, Parth and Shovori's sake. Teni however ends up confessing her feelings to Parth as he contemplates revealing everything to Shorvori. Meanwhile, Bhanushali family is in turmoil following the revelations regarding Teni's pregnancy as Parth accepts the baby to be his! Aman is even forced to break all ties with her and he walks out of her life. But when Shorvori come to Parth and Teni's defense, Dadaji comes to the shocking decision of banishing the trio from the family. But on getting to know of the surrogacy truth, the family eventually forgives Parth, Shorvori and Teni as they are again welcomed in the Bhanushali family.\nParth-Shorvori along with the entire Bhanushali family redouble their efforts to take care of Teni and the perspective child. However, Indu (Vaishnavi Mahant), Parth's mother, starts criticizing Shorvori,for lying about her pregnancy to the family. Shorvori feels distressed and goes on to misunderstand Parth's growing relationship with Teni upon noticing Parth and Teni in few random situations. Shorvori makes a stern request, following which Parth stays away from Teni and even refuses to talk to her. Now with the two people closest to her acting distant and aloof, Teni feels neglected and interacts with Parth ragarding the matter as Shorvori walks in and spotting them together, she lashes out at Parth for breaking his promise and accuses him of cheating on her and takes the drastic decision of leaving the house, ending her relationship with Parth. Later, Teni gets to know that Shorvori has brain tumour and is going to die soon. She just pretended as if she misunderstood Parth and Teni to earn their hatred. She forbids Teni from informing Parth about her condition and wants Teni to be the woman for Parth after her death. Shorvori continues her drama to make Parth and family members hate her, but in vain. Teni decides to help her out in her drama as finally, Shorvori sends divorce papers to Parth and even gets him arrested for one night. The family turns against Shorvori as they now believe that Parth should forget Shorvori and marry Teni instead.The entire family supports Teni when she decides to leave the house with the unborn child as Parth had declined her marriage proposal. Parth begins to suspect Shorvori's true intentions and asks Teni to make Shorvori sign the divorce papers in his presence as a condition for marrying Teni.

Teni witnesses the accident but fails to rescue Shorvori as the car goes up in flames, killing Shorvori!\nTeni informs Parth and the family that Shorvori is dead, much to their shock. Parth disbelieves her, but is heartbroken on seeing the dead body in the hospital. While the family members lament Shorvori's death, Parth struggles to cope with the pain of losing her. Teni, following Shorvori's wish, together with the family, finally convinces Parth to move on for the sake of his and Shorvori's unborn child, however, refuses to marry Teni. On seeing the accident video of Shorvori on Teni's phone, Parth accuses her of murdering Shorvori and tries to get her arrested, without listening Teni's explanation. But Dadaji takes Teni's side and saves her. Thereafter, Teni, following another heated argument with Parth, has labour pain as in just 7 months, she gives birth to a baby girl (whom Teni later names the baby as Ipshita, as per late Shorvori's wish, from Parth's 'P',Shorvori's 'S' and Teni's 'T'). After her delivery, Teni's life is at stake, but Parth donates blood to her, saving her life; and in return, Teni, following Parth's demand, leaves the house and again settles in her colony, where she starts her catering business.\nOn new year's occasion, Parth becomes Teni's partner in a couple dance performance in a competition held in Teni's colony and they win. Teni decides to go to America and asks Parth to come to help her get her visa. Parth becomes very sad and finally confesses his love for Teni and proposes her to marry him which she happily accepts. The whole family prepares for their wedding as per ritual. It is now revealed that Shorvori is alive and had been in coma for 3 months. She returns to the house to reclaim Parth on the day of his wedding with Teni, but gets emotional on seeing Parth marrying Teni and leaves the venue. A stranger offers to drop her, but is drunk and starts misbehaving with her after she gets in the car. This incident is recorded in a CCTV camera and is shown in the news. Parth and Teni, on seeing this, decide to go to Nainital where they get to know Shorvori might be staying.\nIn gs about Teni and saying that she is having a bad intention and Shorvori starts believing it. On the day of Parth's and Shorvori's wedding anniversary, Poyni tells Parth about Teni's sacrifice. Parth later meets Teni in private and they both promise they will be good friends like they were before. Shorvori wants Parth to either choose Teni or her. Teni hears all this and decides to leave the house. Teni's foot accidently slips and Teni falls. At the hospital Teni starts acting weird. The doctor says that Teni is suffering from Selective Memory Loss. Teni starts living in the Bhanushali House as Ipshita's Caretaker. Later, due to some misunderstandings Teni thinks that Bhanushali Family wishes to sell her and are indulged in human trafficking.

They were once the only way a machine could be controlled, and are still used in cases where digital computers are not the best choice. The abacus, a digital device also sometimes called a computer, was used by Babylonians in c. 2500 BC.\nThe earliest known analogue computer in metal was the Antikythera device. However, this was certainly not the first in other forms. Some people think that mental inventions count as analogue computers, such as the invention of the zero (Ancient Egypt 1700 BC). But in that case almost every invention by mankind would count as an analogue computer, and that is not really how the term is used.\nCertainly the invention of the slide rule was important for calculations. They were developed in the 17th century by William Oughtred, after John Napier's work on logarithms. Slide rules are definitely mechanical calculating machines. They were the most commonly used tools in science and engineering before the 1960s/1970s.\nFor the industrial revolution the invention of James Watt's governor was critical, because it was a negative feedback control for large pumps and engines. In fact most analogue computers work with continuous data rather that discrete or digital data. They are like abstract models of the real world. An analogue engine models the critical aspects of the real engine."}

And in order to survive, a snake must have a good form of defense. And the tiger keelback has a very interesting form of defense. In addition to having ordinary venomous snake fangs, they have another trick up their sleeve. Like the poison dart frog and sea slug, the tiger keelback doesn't bother to produce its own venom - rather, it gets its deadly venom from the toads it eats as part of its normal diet. When the tiger keelback feels even the tiniest bit threatened, it'll angle the two little glands on the back of its neck and use it against the predator, the one who seems a threat to the snake. The liquid, or rather, \"fluid,\" that exits the snake's nuchal glands contains something called bufadienolides, that irritate airways and affect heart muscle. \nThe snake eats poisonous toads, which fuels the snake's venom. The tiger keelback also eats a few other small vertebrates."}

{"id": "637538", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=637538", "title": "National Popular Vote Interstate Compact", "text": "The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement among some U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It changes how the Electoral College chooses the president of the United States. The states agree to give all their votes in the Electoral College to the person with the most votes from regular people in the whole country. The agreement makes sure that person will become president. When that result is guaranteed, the agreement will become active.\nNow, eleven states and the District of Columbia are in the agreement. Together, they have 172 votes in the Electoral College, which are called \"electoral votes\". When the agreement has 270 electoral votes, it will become active.\nHow the agreement works.\nThe NPVIC is an interstate compact. It will become active when its members control most of the Electoral College. Before that happens, the members will give their electoral votes the way they do now. After that, they will give all their electoral votes to the person with the most votes from Americans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. (That person wins the \"popular vote\".) This way, that person will become president.\nThe U.S. Constitution lets state legislatures decide how to give their votes in the Electoral College. It says this in . The Constitution does not say how the states must do this. (However, the 14th Amendment says that states cannot discriminate against some groups of people.) In the past, states used different ways. Today, most states give all their electoral votes to the person with the most votes in that state. Maine and Nebraska separate their electoral votes between areas called \"districts\". The NPVIC changes how its members give out their electoral votes.\nReasons for the agreement.\nIn the past, some people who did not get the most votes became president anyway. Most Americans want the person with the most votes to be president despite the fact that two States, California and New York would essentially cancel out the votes of 43 other States and limit the amount of personal exposure those States receive from potential presidential candidates. In 2007, 72% of surveyed Americans said they wanted to change the Electoral College to a direct vote. This included 78% of Democrats, 60% of Republicans, and 73% of independent voters. Surveys since 1944 show most Americans want a direct vote, except in 2016. Reasons for the NPVIC include:\nDebate.\nSeveral newspapers support the NPVIC. They include \"The New York Times\", the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Boston Globe\", and the \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\". These newspapers say that the current system makes people not want to vote. They say the current system gives too much attention to a few states and their problems. Other newspapers are against the agreement, including the \"Honolulu Star-Bulletin\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\". The former governor of Delaware, Pierre S. du Pont IV, said the agreement gives too much power to cities and states with many people. He said it would make politics be about only city problems, and it would let worse people run for office. The League of Women Voters made a list of documents that argue for and against the agreement.\nSome of the biggest arguments are given below:\nAttention.\nToday, people running for president give most of their money and attention to states where the vote will be close. The other states are mostly ignored. The maps here show the amount of advertising and visits by the top two people running in 2004. This is adjusted by the number of people in each state. People who support the NPVIC say that it will make the people running work to get votes in every state. People who are against the NPVIC say that states with few people and few cities will not get enough attention.\nCheating and close elections.\nSome people are against the NPVIC because they worry about cheating. Governor du Pont said that it is easier to add a few false votes in many places than to add many false votes in just a few places. However, National Popular Vote says that adding together all the votes in the country will make it more difficult to cheat. Today, the winner can be decided by a very small number of votes in just one state.\nThe NPVIC does not say how to count the votes again if the result is not clear. Each state does this for its own votes. However, the result for the whole country can be close even if the result in each state is not. People who support the agreement say that a close result is less probable in the whole country than in each state.\nStates with many people and states with few people.\nPeople don't agree about whether the Electoral College helps states with few people, or states with many people. The Electoral College is not designed to be proportional to population: states with few people have more electoral votes for each person than states with many people. If the Electoral College were proportional, California would have 19% more power than it does now. The states with the fewest people would have 30% less power. However, some people say that states with many people have more power than one may expect, because they control so many electoral votes at once. The NPVIC gives the same power to every person, no matter where they live.\nHelping one party.\nSome people believe the NPVIC would help one political party or another, which would not be fair. Pierre S. du Pont IV, a Republican, says the agreement would help Democrats and people in cities. However, Saul Anuzis of the Republican National Committee thinks that the agreement will help Republicans, because he believes most people are closer to Republican political positions. Writer Hendrik Hertzberg of \"The New Yorker\" says the agreement helps neither party: in the past, each party sometimes had the better position in the Electoral College. In the last five elections, the Democrats had the better position in three years (2004, 2008, and 2012) and the Republicans had it in two years (2000 and 2016). In four of those years, Democrats won the most votes in the country.\nDifference between votes in a state and votes in the country.\nThe NPVIC can force a state to give its electoral votes to someone who did not win the most votes in that state. For this reason, two governors (Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Linda Lingle of Hawaii) stopped their states from joining the agreement. (Both those states later joined the agreement.) People who support the agreement say that the number of votes in any one state is not as important as the choice of most people in the whole country.\nConflicts with existing law.\nThose who support the NPVIC say that it is legal and allowed by the U.S. Constitution. Article II of the Constitution lets states decide how to give out their electoral votes. The two men who created the agreement, Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar, hold this position. Jamie Raskin agrees. Raskin is a professor of law and a Congressman from Maryland. He put his name on the first NPVIC bill that became law.\nOne law student wrote that the agreement could break the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protects minority voters. However, the U.S. Department of Justice decided that the agreement does not hurt minority voters. It allowed California to join the agreement in 2012. Rob Richie of the organization FairVote says that the NPVIC \"treats all voters equally\". The same student wrote the NPVIC tries to go around the normal way of changing the Constitution. Raskin replied that going around in this way is legal.\nApproval by Congress.\nIan Drake, an assistant professor of political science, believes the agreement will only be proper if the Constitution is changed. Other writers believe that the agreement is already proper. Those who vote in the Electoral College promise to vote for a certain person, but they do not have to vote that way by law. Michael Brody believes that this makes the agreement proper.\nIt is possible that the agreement needs to be approved by Congress. The Constitution says that agreements between states need Congress to approve. However, the U.S. Supreme Court says that this is not always true. They talked about that question in the court case \"Virginia v. Tennessee\" and others. They decided the only agreements that need approval are those that threaten the authority of the U.S. government. Every Vote Equal says that the NPVIC cannot threaten the authority of the U.S. government, because the Constitution lets states decide how to give out their electoral votes. Derek Muller does not agree. He argues that the NPVIC affects the U.S. government system, and so it needs approval. Ian Drake says that Congress is not allowed to approve the agreement. Those who support the NPVIC do not agree. They do not think the agreement needs approval from Congress, but they plan to ask for this approval in any case.\nHistory.\nPlans to end the Electoral College by changing the Constitution.\nIn the past, people have made several plans to end the Electoral College by changing the Constitution. This is called an \"amendment\". However, this is very difficult to do. First, two thirds of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives need to approve the change. Then, three quarters of the states need to approve the change.\nBayh\u2013Celler Amendment.\nThe plan that came closest to success was the Bayh-Celler plan. It was introduced in the 91st Congress, which met from January 1969 to January 1971. It was introduced by Representative Emanuel Celler of New York. The Bayh-Celler plan would have ended the Electoral College, and instead made a system using the popular vote. The pair of people with the most votes would become president and vice president, as long as they got more than 40% of the votes. If no one got more than 40%, a new vote would happen with the top two pairs. Celler's plan was approved in the House of Representatives in 1969, by a vote of 338\u201370. However, it was stopped in the Senate by a filibuster.\nEvery Vote Counts Amendment.\nIn 2005, Representative Gene Green of Texas introduced another plan to chose the president and vice president using the popular vote. Green introduced his plan to Congress as a \"joint resolution\" called H.J.Res. 9. It was also called the Every Vote Counts Amendment. Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Illinois and Senator Bill Nelson of Florida also introduced joint resolutions in the 111th Congress, which met from 2009 to 2011. All of these plans died in committees, before the whole Congress could vote on them.\nPlan using an agreement between states.\nIn 2001, a law professor named Robert Bennett introduced a new plan. Bennett's plan did not require a change to the Constitution. His plan used the power of the states instead of fighting against it. In Bennett's plan, a group of states that control most of the Electoral College could work together. They would make the popular vote decide the result of elections.\nTwo other law professors, brothers named Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar, supported this plan. The Amar brothers proposed an agreement between states, made with laws in those states. The states would give all their electoral votes to the person who won the popular vote. The agreement would not become active until it guaranteed that person would win the Electoral College and become president. This agreement became the NPVIC.\nThe Amar brothers' plan uses two parts of the Constitution:\nThe Amar brothers' plan could work with as few as eleven states. They believe it would not need approval from Congress. However, that is not certain: the section Approval by Congress explains why.\nOrganization and work.\nIn 2006, the computer science professor John Koza wrote a book called \"Every Vote Equal\". The book argues for a National Popular Vote agreement between states. (Koza knew about agreements between states from his work on lottery tickets.) Koza, Barry Fadem, and others made a non-profit organization called National Popular Vote. This organization promotes the NPVIC. It is led by people from both major political parties, including former Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.\nIn 2006, legislatures in six states looked at NPVIC bills. Illinois even introduced a bill before National Popular Vote announced it at a press conference. That year, the Colorado Senate approved the bill. Both houses of the California legislature approved the bill, but Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger stopped it with a veto.\nJoining.\nIn 2007, 42 states looked at bills to join the NPVIC. One house of the legislature approved bills in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Maryland, and Hawaii. Maryland was the first state to join the agreement. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley signed the agreement into law on April 10, 2007.\nEleven states and the District of Columbia have joined the agreement. In Colorado, both houses of the legislature have approved the bill, and it is waiting for Governor Jared Polis to sign it.\nAll 50 states have looked at bills to join the NPVIC. In some states, only one house has approved the agreement: Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Oregon. In New Mexico, the agreement was approved by both houses, but in different years. Maryland, New Jersey, and Washington had bills to leave the agreement, but these failed.\nThe U.S. Congress can stop laws in the District of Columbia within 30 working days, but they did not do this.\nInitiatives and referendums.\nSome states allow laws to be made with a direct vote by the public, called an \"initiative\" or a \"referendum\". First, supporters must get a certain number of people to sign their names. Then, the question can be given to the voters. In 2018, groups in Arizona, Maine, and Missouri worked on initiatives to join the agreement, but these did not get enough people to sign.\nChances.\nNate Silver, who studies elections, says that the NPVIC cannot succeed without support from \"red\" states (states that mostly vote for Republicans). So far, only \"blue\" states have joined (states that mostly vote for Democrats). However, legislatures controlled by Republicans have agreed to join the agreement in Arizona, Oklahoma, and New York."}

Some sources point his own father as requesting the exile as he was a troublemaker. \nNorman Assault on the Isle of Ely.\nIt is unknown exactly when the next event happened but it is thought to have happened around 1069 and 1070. After being exiled Hereward returned to his family home where he discovered that the Normans had murdered his brother and set his head above the door. Hereward sought revenge and murdered a bunch of Normans and set their heads in place of his brother's. Hereward then fled to the Fens where he was sheltered by Abbot Thurstan. \nAround spring time in 1070, Hereward the Wake and King Sweyn of Denmark took the Isle of Ely. Hereward made the Isle his base for his rebellion against the Normans. \nJune, 1070, Hereward raided Peterborough Abbey as an act of defiance against the Normans. He stated that he would take the Abbey's treasures into safekeeping away from the Normans. Some sources state that his uncle was the Abbot of the Abbey and Hereward persuaded his uncle to kill him.\nPrimary sources.\nSeveral primary sources exist for Hereward's life. Their accuracy is difficult to judge. They are the version of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" written at Peterborough Abbey (the \"E manuscript\" or Peterborough Chronicle), the \"Domesday Book\" (DB), the \"Liber Eliensis\" (Book of Ely) and, much the most detailed, the \"Gesta Herewardi\" (\"Gesta\")."}

It lives throughout North America.\nDescription.\nThe average length for an adult eastern hognose snake is 71 cm (28 in) in length. The most amazing feature is the upturned nose. It is used for digging in sandy soils. It can be red, green, orange, brown or gray to black depending on where it comes from. The belly tends to be a solid gray, yellow, or cream-colored.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nIt is found from southern New Hampshire south to the southern tip of Florida and into the central United States. Eastern hognose snakes are also found as far west as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and into the southern tip of South Dakota. In total, they are found in about thirty states in the United States and are also found in southern Ontario.\nEastern hognose snakes are mostly found in places with dry, sandy, or mixed sandy soils. They are usually found in grassy fields, fields that contain crops, and along woodland edges. Sometimes they can be found near small bodies of water. Eastern hognose snakes are also sometimes found in buildings such as greenhouses and barns.\nDiet.\nThe Eastern hognose snake eats mainly frogs, lizards, salamanders, insects, other invertebrates, and small rodents. It is only mildly venomous. That means that, much like garter snakes, there's only enough toxins in their saliva to paralyze small animals. \nPredators.\nThe predators of the Eastern hognose snake are raccoons, Virginia opossums, red foxes, hawks, common king snakes, cottonmouths, tarantulas.\nBehaviour.\nEastern hognose snakes are diurnal animals. They will swim to cross between habitats and to find food or mates. Eastern hognose snakes are mostly active from early April until October or November depending on the temperature. Eastern hognose snakes usually begin hibernation anywhere from early September into November. If the temperatures drop to 19 degrees Celsius, they will begin their hibernation. Eastern hognose snakes hibernate by themselves in either burrows made by themselves or abandoned mammal burrows. Eastern hognose snakes tend to burrow at night into sandy soil.\nReproduction.\nEastern hognose snakes mate in April and May. They lay 8 - 40 eggs in June or early July. They do not take care of the eggs or young. The eggs hatch after about 60 days, from late July to September. The hatchlings are 16.5\u201321 cm (6.5\u20138.3 in) long.\nDefense.\nWhen threatened, the hognose will play dead. It sometimes even lets its tongue hang from its mouth.\nVenom.\nIt is often thought to be nonvenomous because it is not harmful to humans but it does have venom. Bitten humans who are allergic to the saliva have been known to experience swelling, but no human deaths have been recorded.\nConservation status.\nEastern hognose snakes are listed as least concern on the IUCN red list. In the future, they may be threatened because of habitat destruction and decrease in the number of toad in their native areas. Eastern hognose snakes are sometimes mistaken for pygmy rattlesnakes and are often killed because of this.\nEconomic importance.\nEastern hognose snakes eats lots of small mammals, insects, and amphibians and therefore limit their populations. They have the strongest role in limiting toad populations. Eastern hognose snakes have been reported to be mildly venomous to humans."}

Several relatives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad had the name, including his daughter Fatimah \nThe colloquial Arabic pronunciation of the name in some dialects (e.g., Syria and Egyptian ) often omits the unstressed second syllable and renders it as \"Fatma\" when romanized. \nFatima is also used by non-Muslims: the town of F\u00e1tima, Portugal was named after a Moorish princess. It was the site of a famous Marian apparition in 1917, after which it achieved some popularity as a female personal name among Roman Catholic populations, particularly in the Portuguese-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds."}

It is known as the origin of Vietnamese popular music. Harmonious, sentimental and melancholy, many romantic songs of purple music have become regarded as national treasures and are still performed widely.\nHistory.\nSongs of Purple Music carry with them an air of nostalgia, perhaps nostalgia for an era when Vietnam was still unified, the era preceding nearly 20 years of civil war. After 1954, the country was split into two very different regimes, the communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam or North Vietnam, and the Republic of Vietnam or South Vietnam. At that time, some purple music composers went South, while others remained in the North. Most of the Northerners either ceased composing or followed the dictates of the regime for writing songs to mobilize the masses and strengthen the revolution. Southerners continued to write romantic songs. Since the North's victory resulting in Vietnam's reunification in 1975, the country's culture has continued to be divided between resident and overseas communities. As nearly all music and literature of a romantic or sentimental basis was banned by the communist regime, many of Vietnam's creative minds left the country in 1975 for Western countries like the United States, Australia, and France. Although differences between these two communities continue until this time, purple music is one of the few popular song genres that can be heard on the stage of both Vietnam and among the overseas community.\nAlthough Vietnamese music this period has gone through many movements : Patriotic songs, scout songs, happy songs, folk songs... the longest lasting movement is still love song movement. That is the music movement with greatest composers like V\u0103n Cao, Ph\u1ea1m Duy, L\u00ea Th\u01b0\u01a1ng... and with ever-lasting love songs like. Amongst the best-known ones are \"I Come to See You One Rainy Afternoon\" (Em \u0111\u1ebfn th\u0103m anh m\u1ed9t chi\u1ec1u m\u01b0a) by T\u00f4 V\u0169 ; \"Send the Wind to Blow Away the Clouds\" (G\u1eedi gi\u00f3 cho m\u00e2y ng\u00e0n bay), \"Seductive Autumn\" (Thu quy\u1ebfn r\u0169), \"Leaves Falling in the Afternoon\" (L\u00e1 \u0111\u1ed5 mu\u00f4n chi\u1ec1u), \"A Letter\" (L\u00e1 th\u01b0), \"Plum Pack and Pansy Petal\" (M\u1ed9t g\u00f3i nho kh\u00f4, m\u1ed9t c\u00e1nh p\u0103ng-x\u00ea) by \u0110o\u00e0n Chu\u1ea9n ; \"Resonance\" (D\u01b0 \u00e2m) by Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n T\u00fd ; \"The Girl Next Door\" (C\u00f4 l\u00e1ng gi\u1ec1ng) by Ho\u00e0ng Qu\u00fd ; \"Drop of Autumn Rain\" (Gi\u1ecdt m\u01b0a thu) and \"The Boat isn't Docking\" (Con thuy\u1ec1n kh\u00f4ng b\u1ebfn) by \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ebf Phong."}

This virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and causes severe disease in humans, where approximately half of all patients die. The virus is commonly transmitted by fruit eating bats. \nSymptoms.\nThe symptoms start to appear within 3-14 days of Nipah virus infection. When people first get Nipah virus infection, it looks like some other diseases. People get fever, headache, throat pain and feel very tired. They find it difficult to breathe. Later, they get much sicker. They feel dizzy and might become unconscious. As of now, we know 582 cases of humans infected with Nipah virus, out of which approximately half died. \nTransmission.\nNipah virus is transmitted by fruit eating bats. The bats may transmit the virus to other animals, such as pigs. Humans can be affected when they come in contact with items that are contaminated by infected bats' excreta. In Bangladesh, people were affected by the virus when they drank date palm toddy which was contaminated by bats. In Malaysia and Singapore, humans were affected by pigs that came into contact with bats. Nipah virus can transmit from people to people also. The caretakers of the sick are more likely to be affected because the virus transmits through body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine etc. The virus is not known to transmit through air. \nDetection.\nNipah virus can be detected from throat swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (fluid taken by puncturing the spine) and blood. Detection is done by picking copies of viral genome from the test sample. Virus can also be identified by examining the tissues of persons who died of the disease.\nTreatment.\nThere is no effective treatment for Nipah virus infection until now. Ribavirin, a drug that acts against some viruses is possibly effective, but its effectiveness has not been well proved yet. Therefore, the treatment is now to give supportive care, such as giving medicines to reduce fever and other symptoms. Ventilatory support is given in case the patient becomes very sick. \nPrevention.\nIn order to prevent the disease, it is important not to come in contact with items contaminated by infected bats. As the disease may transmit from person to person, those in close contact with a patient must wear protective gear including special masks, gloves and goggles. Healthcare workers in infected areas should also wear protective gear. \nOutbreaks.\nNipah virus has caused disease outbreaks in several parts of the world including Malaysia, Bangladesh, Singapore and India. There was an outbreak of Nipah virus is in Kerala, India which was successfully contained in 2018."}

Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to ignore increases in temperature caused by prostaglandin. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever. These elevations alter the firing rate of neurons that control thermoregulation in the hypothalamus. Although fever benefits the nonspecific immune response to invading microorganisms, it is also viewed as a source of discomfort and is commonly suppressed with antipyretic medication. Antipyretics such as aspirin have been widely used since the late 19th century, but the mechanisms by which they relieve fever have only been characterized in the last few decades. It is now clear that most antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase and reducing the levels of PGE2 within the hypothalamus.\nMost antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the United States are ibuprofen and aspirin. These are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used mainly as analgesics to relieve pain, but which also have antipyretic properties. Acetaminophen or (paracetamol), is an analgesic with weak anti-inflammatory properties.\nThere is some debate over using medication to control fever. Fever is part of the body's immune response to infection. A study by the Royal Society found controlling fever causes at least 1% more influenza cases of death in the United States, which results in at least 700 extra deaths per year."}

Chuck teaches her how to perform sexual acts.\nLinda breaks curfew one night. She is slapped by her mother. She moves out to live with Chuck and marries him. At a party, Linda watches one of Chuck's pornographic movies. She tells him good girls never do things like that.\nSix months later, Linda bails Chuck out of jail for soliciting prostitution. Chuck is desperate for money. He makes Linda become a porn actress. She soon begins working on a movie, \"Deep Throat\". In the movie, she uses the stage name Linda Lovelace. The movie is a huge hit. It makes over $30,000 in its first week. Linda later poses nude. She attends parties.\nBut Chuck has a violent nature. Linda's life is revealed to not be as perfect as it seems. Chuck chokes Linda during sex. When she asks Chuck to stop, he refuses. He forces her into prostitution at gunpoint. \nLinda visits her parents to ask if she can move back. She reveals that Chuck has been abusing her. But her mother says no.\nWhen Chuck learns that Linda has been talking about a new salary with the movie's director, Gerard Damiano, without telling him, Chuck punishes her by making her shower in freezing water. \nWhen \"Deep Throat\" becomes a hit, Chuck tries to force Linda into doing another porn movie. But she refuses to do that. He then takes her to a party and forces her to participate in a sexual act with several people. Linda tries to escape from Chuck. But he catches her and sleeps on top of her to stop her from trying again.\nThe following day, she secretly meets a man named Anthony Romano. She tells Romano she wants out of the porn business. She reveals the abuse done by Chuck. A disgusted Romano checks Linda into a private hotel. Romano and his bodyguards beat Chuck for abusing Linda, and for the $25,000 he owes.\nSix years later, following her divorce from Chuck, Linda marries Larry Marchiano. They move to Long Island and have a son. She then takes a lie detector test before publishing her book \"Ordeal\". The book details years of physical and sexual abuse from Chuck, and stealing of all her earnings. She later appears on \"Donahue\". Her parents break down in tears while watching her. A few days later, the Marchianos go to Florida for Linda to make up with her parents.\nReception.\n\"Lovelace\" got mixed reviews from critics.

It was launched in 1418. The ship sailed only sailed on one voyage after which it was kept anchored in the River Hamble. The ship was burned in 1439 after being struck by lightning.\nDesign and construction.\n\"Grace Dieu\" was designed by William Soper, a burgess of Southampton and clerk of the King's Ships. She was clinker-built with three planks nailed together along each part of her hull and waterproofed with tar and moss sandwiched between the timbers. She was long with a beam, comparable in size with \"HMS Victory\" and twice as large as \"Mary Rose\".\u00a0The ship weighed between 1,400 tons and 2,750 tons. Two other ships, \"Valentine\" and \"Falcon\" were built to follow her. A dock was specially built for her construction near Town Quay in Southampton.\nThe remains of \"Grace Dieu\" show that it might have been built in a hurry, with some of the planks and ribs only roughly finished. She was a vast ship requiring 2735 oak, 1145 beech, and fourteen ash trees for her timbers. When completed in 1418, she was one of the largest wooden ships of the time.\n1420 voyage.\nIn 1420, \"Grace Dieu\"made her only voyage under the command of the Earl of Devon, with orders to sail down the English Channel. The expedition suffered a mutiny even before leaving port, when the crew objected to soldiers and archers being aboard to guard the vessel. \"Grace Dieu\"'s sailors attempted to prevent the soldiers from boarding by abusing the clerk who was registering their names and threatening to throw the register into the sea. When the ship finally left port, nine of the crew incited a further mutiny against the captain by refusing to take their stations and insisting that the cruise be abandoned. \"Grace Dieu\" was brought into the nearest port, St. Helen's on the Isle of Wight, and the crew departed. A clerk who questioned their loyalty as they departed was assaulted and had his clothing torn.\nService after Henry V's death and loss.\nWhen Henry V died in 1422, his ships were treated as his private property rather than as part of the kingdom's navy. Many were sold off to pay his debts.\nIn 1430 William Soper, when he was already in charge of the administration of the entire navy, dined with the commander of the Florentine merchant fleet on board \"Grace Dieu\".\nSubsequently, \"Grace Dieu\" was laid-up in the River Hamble. Her mast and equipment were removed. She was burnt to the waterline after being set ablaze by lightning in 1439.\nRediscovery.\nThe remains of \"Grace Dieu\" are still in the River Hamble at Bursledon, near Southampton, Hampshire. For many years the wreck was believed to be that of a Danish galley or a nineteenth-century merchant ship. In 1933 a proper survey identified the wreck, and its great size. The site was protected by the Protection of Wrecks Act on 5 February 1974. In 2004 the site was excavated by Channel 4's archaeology programme \"Time Team\" for the 2005 series. Only 50 metres from the wreck lie those of another vessel, believed to be \"Grace Dieu\"'s contemporary \"Holigost\"."}

Ordinary water has the common hydrogen-1 isotope ( or H, also called \"protium\"). This makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal \"light water\". Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator in some nuclear reactors, such as CANDU reactors. It is a more efficient neutron moderator than regular water, allowing the use of unenriched uranium as fuel. Pure heavy water is not radioactive, because deuterium is a stable isotope, but heavy water that has been through a nuclear reactor is slightly radioactive.\nThe chemistry of heavy water is different enough that people, and most living things, cannot survive with heavy water in place of ordinary water. Small amounts are not toxic to people. It is common for people to drink several grams of heavy water for metabolic experiments without causing illness. "}

The usual context is police stopping and searching citizens on the suspicion that they may have committed a crime. It is controversial because it is usually black citizens who are stopped and searched. In other countries (for example the Middle East) religious and cultural differences may be the basis of police profiling. \nInt the USA profiling has been tested in the courts a number of times. \"Terry v. Ohio\" was the first challenge to racial profiling in the United States in 1968. This case was about African American people who were thought to be stealing. The police officer arrested the three men, searched them and found a gun on two of the three men. One of the men searched was convicted and sentenced to jail. The sentence was challenged on the grounds that the arrest violated the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment. In an 8-1 ruling, the Supreme Court decided that the police officer acted in a reasonable manner, and with reasonable suspicion, under the Fourth Amendment. The decision in this case allowed the police to have discretion in identifying suspicious or illegal activities."}

The fossil was kept in a closet of the Laboratory of Paleovertebrates of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul South, under the tutelage of Professor Cesar Schultz. This is what is commonly called \"drawer paleontology\". The fossil was described as a sauropodomorph on May 25, 2018.\nDescription.\nSize.\nIt grew to about 2.5 meters (8.2\u00a0ft) long and about 1.3 (4.2\u00a0ft) long.\nDiet.\n\"Bagualosaurus\" probably had a fully herbivourus diet. The fact that the \"Bagualosaurus\" already has a dentition well adapted to the consumption of vegetation is especially important for the evolutionary history of the dinosaurs. Pretto explains that all sauropods have two characteristics in common: gigantism and herbivorism. \"Bagualosaurus\" and other early sauropodomorphs may have adopted the leaf diet, which may have been the source of sauropod gigantism.\nPaleoecology.\n\"Bagualosaurus\" lived in the Santa Maria Formaiton alongside an unnamed prosauropod and genera such as the carnivourus sauropodomorph \"Buriolestes, \"the proterochampsid \"Cerritosaurus\" and the possible theropod \"Staurikosaurus\"."}

It was made by Josh Selig in New York City. It is about a group of talking hand puppets with eyes and clothes. The main character, Oobi, is a four-year-old boy hand. He has a sister named Uma, a friend named Kako, and a grandfather named Grampu.\nThe show was first played in 2000 as a series of two-minute short episodes. It started as a series of longer half-hour episodes in 2003. It was shown on the channels Nickelodeon and .\nWhile it was being made, the show was popular with preschoolers and fans of puppetry. It won awards from groups like and the . In the mid-2000s, there was a cult following of small filmmakers who used Oobi-style puppets in short movies. In 2012, a spin-off of \"Oobi\" called \"Dasdasi\" was made in Iran. The entire original show is currently included on Amazon Prime Video.\nStructure and plot.\nMost episodes are split into two or three parts. Every episode has a main story and some interviews. In the interviews, the puppets ask real kids and families about a topic or place. Episodes in season one also have a \"game segment\" where the puppets play a simple learning game. In season two, there were no game segments anymore and the main stories were made longer instead.\nThe show takes place in an old-fashioned town where almost everyone is a talking hand puppet. The puppets have eyes that they wear on the middle finger. The kids have four of their fingers straight, and they use their thumbs as their bottom lips. The adults have their fingers curled up, which makes them look taller. The only regular character who is not a hand is Frieda, a foot puppet.\nInternational broadcast.\nThe show has also been shown in:\n\"Dasdasi\".\n\"Dasdasi\" was a spin-off/adaptation of \"Oobi\" made in the country of Iran for a TV channel called . In \"Dasdasi\", there is a bigger family of hand puppets: a son, a daughter, two parents, and a grandfather. The kids are counterparts to Oobi and Uma, and the grandpa is Grampu's counterpart. Kako does not have a counterpart, but the kids have neighbors and a baby cousin who usually fills the role of a close friend instead. \"Dasdasi\" was first shown on September 22, 2012, and the last episode was shown on December 20, 2012. There were 78 episodes.\nReception.\n\"Oobi\" got high TV ratings for Noggin.

The average number of preschool-age children watching \"Oobi\" grew by 43% during the same time. The show's ratings were reported in the newspaper Multichannel News by the author Mike Reynolds, who said Noggin's popularity could be traced to its \"breakout original series \"Oobi\".\" The first showing of the \"Uma Preschool!\" episode on September 6, 2004, got higher ratings than any other Noggin show ever did.\nWhen \"Oobi\" was still being played on TV, it had a of Muppets fans and small filmmakers who made their own \"Oobi\" puppets. In 2003, the \"Boston Herald\" newspaper said that \"Oobi\" was \"already very popular\" with \"those of the Muppet generation.\" A worker for Noggin, Tom Ascheim, said in the same article that Oobi \"gets fan mail,\" and he thought it was an interesting idea for a show because \"everybody has an Oobi in their hand.\" In 2004, the magazine \"The Melbourne Age\" said that \"the show - the work of various \"Sesame Street\" alumni - is developing a strong cult following; the real Uma [Thurman] is said to be a fan of hand Uma.\" An internet catalog of \"Oobi\" puppets and eyes, OobiEyes.com, was online from 2006 to 2013. A small group of YouTube.com users who made fan films with \"Oobi\" puppets existed during the early years of the website, and OobiEyes.com held an advertising campaign with YouTube in 2008."}

{"id": "640008", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=640008", "title": "Pontiac's War", "text": "Pontiac's War (also known as Pontiac's Conspiracy or Pontiac's Rebellion) was an uprising of Native American tribes against English rule in America. A few tribes, mainly from the Great Lakes region, the Illinois Country, and Ohio Country started it in 1763. The cause of the war was that these tribes were dissatisfied with British poltics in the region. Warriors from other tribes joined the uprising, to help drive the English soldiers and settlers out of the region. The war is named after the Odawa leader Pontiac, the most prominent of many native leaders in the conflict.\nThe British were among the winners of the French and Indian War, which lasted from 1754 to 1763. As a result, large territories in the region that were controlled by the French came under English rule. French and English politics were very different. \nThe war began in May 1763 when Native Americans attacked a number of British forts and settlements. They attacked, because they had been offended by the policies of British General Jeffrey Amherst. Eight forts were destroyed, and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured. Many people fled from the region. Hostilities came to an end after British Army expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years. Native Americans were unable to drive away the British, but the uprising prompted the British government to change the policies that had provoked the conflict.\nWarfare on the North American frontier was brutal: Prisoners were often killed. Civilians were often targeted. Other atrocities were widespread. The population of Native Americans and British settlers had very little in common. In this conflict, this fact showed as ruthlessness and treachery. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War. Because of the conflict, the Proclamation's Indian clauses were applied more often, though. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may have been one of the early contributing factors to the American Revolution.\nNaming the conflict.\nThe conflict is named after its most famous participant, the Ottawa leader Pontiac; variations include \"Pontiac's War\", \"Pontiac's Rebellion\", and \"Pontiac's Uprising\". An early name for the war was the \"Kiyasuta and Pontiac War\".\"Kiyasuta\" is a different spelling for Guyasuta, an influential Seneca/Mingo leader. The war became widely known as \"Pontiac's Conspiracy\" after Francis Parkman's \"The Conspiracy of Pontiac\" was published in 1851. This important book has been the definitive account of the war for nearly a century and is still in print.\nIn the 20th century, some historians argued that Parkman exaggerated Pontiac's influence in the conflict and that it was misleading to name the war after him. For example, in 1988 Francis Jennings wrote: \"In Francis Parkman's murky mind the backwoods plots [came] from one savage genius, the Ottawa chief Pontiac, and [for this reason] they became 'The Conspiracy of Pontiac,' but Pontiac was only a local Ottawa war chief in a 'resistance' involving many tribes.\" Even though other names for the war have been proposed, many historians still use familiar names for this war. \"Pontiac's War\" is probably the most commonly used. Scholars use the name \"Pontiac's Conspiracy\" less often.\nOrigins.\nIn the decades before Pontiac's rebellion, there were a number of wars in Europe which also had an influence on the French and Indian Wars in North America. The largest of these wars was the Seven Years' War. In this war, France lost New France in North America to Great Britain. The Shawnee and Lenape had also fought in this war. The Treaty of Easton was signed in 1758, and brought peace with these tribes. In the treaty, the British promised not to settle further beyond the ridge of the Alleghenies. This line was confirmed in 1763, but few people respected it. Most fighting in the North American theater of the war, generally referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States, came to an end after British General Jeffrey Amherst captured Montreal, the last important French settlement, in 1760.\nBritish troops then occupied the various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously held by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. The politics of the French and the English was different, though. The French had made alliaces with certain Native American tribes, and traded with them. After the war, these Native American tribes were conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French were more and more dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.\nTribes involved.\nToday, it is difficult to say who exactly took part in the rebellion. At the time, the region was known as \"pays d'en haut\" (\"upper country\"), but its borders were not defined exactly. Until the Paris peace treaty of 1763, it was claimed by France. Native Americans from many different tribes lived there. At the time, a \"tribe\" was a group of people who spoke the same language, or a group of people who belonged to the same family. It was not a political unit. No chief spoke for an entire tribe, and no tribe acted in unison. For example, Ottawas did not go to war as a tribe: some Ottawa leaders chose to do so, while other Ottawa leaders denounced the war and stayed clear of the conflict.\nThere were three basic groups of tribes. The first group was composed of tribes of the Great Lakes region: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi, who spoke Algonquian languages; and the Huron, who spoke an Iroquoian language. They had long been allied with French \"habitants\". They lived among them, they traded with them, and marriages between French settlers and Native Americans were common. Great Lakes Native Americans were alarmed to learn that they were under British sovereignty after the French loss of North America. When a British garrison took possession of Fort Detroit from the French in 1760, local Native Americans cautioned them that \"this country was given by God to the Indians.\"\nThe second group was made of the tribes from eastern Illinois Country: It included the Miami, Wea, Kickapoo, Mascouten, and Piankashaw. Like the Great Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last to come to terms with the British.\nThe third group was made of tribes of the Ohio Country: Delawares (Lenape), Shawnee, Wyandot, and Mingo. These people had migrated to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas. They did this to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio Native Americans had no great attachment to the French regime. They had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British. They made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive out the British.\nOutside the \"pays d'en haut\", most warriors of the influential Iroquois Confederacy did not participate in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the \"Covenant Chain\". However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt to drive out the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.\nAmherst's policies.\nGeneral Amherst was the British commander-in-chief in North America. He was also responsible for the policy regarding the treatment of Native Americans. This involved both military matters and the regulation of the fur trade. In Amherst's opinion, the Native Americans had to accept British rule, since the French were no longer in control of the territory. He also believed that they were incapable of resisting against the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.\nIn February 1761, Amherst took the decision to offer fewer gifts to the Native Americans. With the French, the giving of gifts had been common, and part of the relationship between French and Native Americans. Therefore, Amherst's decision led to more resentment towards the English. Following a Native American custom the exchange of gifts had an important symbolic meaning: the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.\nAmherst also began to restrict the amount of ammunition and gunpowder that traders could sell to Native Americans. The French had always made these goods available. Amherst, however, did not trust the Native Americans, particularly after the \"Cherokee Rebellion\" of 1761. In this rebellion Cherokee warriors took up arms against their former British allies. The Cherokee war effort had collapsed because of a shortage of gunpowder. Amherst therefore hoped that future uprisings could be prevented by restricting the supply of\u00a0gunpowder. This created resentment and hardship: Native American men needed gunpowder and ammunition, because it helped them with hunting. With gunpowder and ammunition, they had more game for their families and skins for the fur trade. Many Native Americans began to believe that the British were disarming them before starting war against them. Sir William Johnson, the Superintendent of the Indian Department, tried to warn Amherst of the dangers of cutting back on gifts and gunpowder, but he was not successful.\nLand and religion.\nLand was also an issue in the coming of the war. With the French, there were relatively few colonists. Most of the colonists were farmers, who also traded fur during the hunting season. In contrast, there were many British colonists. The British colonists wanted to clear the land of the trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east: This was the main reason for their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement. They were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east, though. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers. Dowd argues that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. He believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.\nAnother factor that led to the outbreak of the war was a religious awakening of the Native Americans in the region in the 1760s. Food shortages and epidemics, as well as discontent with the British fed the movement. The most influential person in this phenomenon was Neolin, known as the \"Delaware Prophet\". Neolin said, Native Americans should steer clear of the trade goods, alcohol, and weapons of the whites. Merging elements from Christianity into traditional religious beliefs, Neolin told listeners that the Master of Life was displeased with the Native Americans for taking up the bad habits of the white men, and that the British posed a threat to their very existence. \"If you suffer the English among you,\" Neolin said, \"you are dead men. Sickness, smallpox, and their poison [alcohol] will destroy you entirely.\" It was a powerful message for a people whose world was being changed by forces that seemed beyond their control.\nOutbreak of war, 1763.\nPlanning the war.\nAlthough fighting in Pontiac's Rebellion began in 1763, rumors reached British officials as early as 1761. According to these rumors, discontented Native Americans were planning an attack. Senecas of the Ohio Country (Mingos) circulated messages (\"war belts\" made of wampum) which called for the tribes to form a confederacy and drive away the British. The Mingos, led by Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris, were concerned about being surrounded by British forts. Similar war belts originated from Detroit and the Illinois Country. The Native Americans were not unified, however, and in June 1761, Native Americans at Detroit informed the British commander of the Seneca plot. After William Johnson held a large council with the tribes at Detroit in September 1761, peace was maintained, but war belts continued to circulate. Violence finally erupted after the Native Americans learned in early 1763 that the French would give the \"pays d'en haut\" to the British.\nThe war began at Fort Detroit under the leadership of Pontiac. It quickly spread throughout the region. Eight British forts were taken; others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt, were unsuccessfully besieged. Francis Parkman's \"The Conspiracy of Pontiac\" portrayed these attacks as a coordinated operation planned by Pontiac. Parkman's interpretation remains well known. Other historians have since argued that there is no clear evidence that the attacks were part of a master plan or overall \"conspiracy\". The most common view among scholars today is that, rather than being planned in advance, the uprising spread as word of Pontiac's actions at Detroit traveled throughout the \"pays d'en haut\", inspiring already discontented Native Americans to join the revolt. The attacks on British forts did not happen at the same time: most Ohio Native Americans did not enter the war until nearly a month after the beginning of Pontiac's siege at Detroit.\nParkman also believed that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the Native Americans in order to make trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke about the fact that French power was about to return. When this happened, the Franco-Native alliance would be revived; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native\u2014not French\u2014objectives.\nHistorian Richard Middleton (2007) argues that Pontiac's vision, courage, persistence, and organizational abilities allowed him to activate a remarkable coalition of Indian nations prepared to fight successfully against the British. The idea to gain independence for all Native Americans west of the Allegheny Mountains did not originate with Pontiac, but with two Seneca leaders, Tahaiadoris and Guyasuta. By February 1763 Pontiac appeared to embrace the idea. At an emergency council meeting, Pontiac clarified his military support of the broad Seneca plan and worked to motivate other nations to join the military operation that he helped lead. This was in direct contradiction to traditional Indian leadership and tribal structure. He achieved this coordination through the distribution of war belts: first to the northern Ojibwa and Ottawa near Michilimackinac; and then after the failure to seize Detroit by stratagem, to the Mingo (Seneca) on the upper Allegheny River, the Ohio Delaware near Fort Pitt, and the more westerly Miami, Kickapoo, Piankashaw and Wea peoples.\nSiege of Fort Detroit.\nOn April 27, 1763, Pontiac spoke at a council on the banks of the Ecorse River, in what is now Lincoln Park, Michigan, about 10 miles (15\u00a0km) southwest of Detroit. Using the teachings of Neolin, Pontiac convinced a number of Ottawas, Ojibwas, Potawatomis, and Hurons to join him in an attempt to seize Fort Detroit. On May 1, Pontiac visited the fort with 50 Ottawas in order to assess the strength of the garrison. According to a French chronicler, in a second council Pontiac proclaimed:It is important for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us. You see as well as I that we can no longer supply our needs, as we have done from our brothers, the French... Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.Hoping to take the stronghold by surprise, on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men carrying concealed weapons. The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. As his tactic had not worked, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council. Two days later, he started a siege of the fort. Pontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28, a British supply from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee.\nAfter receiving reinforcements, the British attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate. Pontiac's influence among his followers began to fade. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.\nSmall forts taken.\nBefore other British outposts had learned about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts in a series of attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed in the early stages of the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort\u2014as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier\u2014was burned to the ground.\nFort St. Joseph (the site of present-day Niles, Michigan) was captured on May 25, 1763, by the same method as at Sandusky. Potawatomis seized the commander and killed most of the 15-man garrison. Fort Miami (on the site of present Fort Wayne, Indiana) was the third fort to fall. On May 27, 1763, the commander was lured out of the fort by his Native mistress and shot dead by Miami Native Americans. The nine-man garrison surrendered after the fort was surrounded.\nIn the Illinois Country, , Kickapoos, and Mascoutens took Fort Ouiatenon (about west of present Lafayette, Indiana) on June 1, 1763. They lured soldiers outside for a council, and took the 20-man garrison captive without bloodshed. The Native Americans around Fort Ouiatenon had good relations with the British garrison, but emissaries from Pontiac at Detroit had convinced them to strike. The warriors apologized to the commander for taking the fort, saying that \"they were obliged to do it by the other Nations.\" In contrast with other forts, the Natives did not kill the British captives at Ouiatenon.\nThe fifth fort to fall, Fort Michilimackinac (present Mackinaw City, Michigan), was the largest fort taken by surprise. On June 2, 1763, local Ojibwas staged a game of stickball (a forerunner of lacrosse) with visiting Sauks. The soldiers watched the game, as they had done on previous occasions. The ball was hit through the open gate of the fort; the teams rushed in and were given weapons which Native women had smuggled into the fort. The warriors killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle; later they killed five more in ritual torture.\nThree forts in the Ohio Country were taken in a second wave of attacks in mid-June. Iroquois Senecas took Fort Venango (near the site of the present Franklin, Pennsylvania) around June 16, 1763. They killed the entire 12-man garrison, keeping the commander alive to write down the grievances of the Senecas. After that, they ritually burned him at the stake. Possibly the same Seneca warriors attacked Fort Le Boeuf (on the site of Waterford, Pennsylvania) on June 18, but most of the 12-man garrison escaped to Fort Pitt.\nOn June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors surrounded Fort Presque Isle (on the site of Erie, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After holding out for two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, on the condition that they could return to Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort.\nSiege of Fort Pitt.\nColonists in western Pennsylvania fled to the safety of Fort Pitt after the outbreak of the war. Nearly 550 people crowded inside, including more than 200 women and children. Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss-born British officer in command, wrote: \"We are so crowded in the fort that I fear disease...; the smallpox is among us.\" Fort Pitt was attacked on June 22, 1763, primarily by Delawares. The fort was too strong to be taken by force. A siege was organized, which lasted during the month of July. In the meantime, war parties raided deep into Pennsylvania, taking prisoners and killing unknown numbers of settlers in scattered farms.Too strong to be taken by force, the fort was kept under siege throughout July. Meanwhile, Delaware and Shawnee war parties raided deep into Pennsylvania, taking captives and killing unknown numbers of settlers in scattered farms. Two smaller strongholds that linked Fort Pitt to the east, Fort Bedford and Fort Ligonier, were fired upon throughout the conflict, but were never taken.\nBefore the war, Amherst did not believe that the Native Americans would offer any effective resistance to British rule. During that summer, he was convinced of the contrary. He ordered to \"immediately ... put to death\" captured enemy Native American warriors. To Colonel Henry Bouquet at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who was preparing to lead an expedition to relieve Fort Pitt, Amherst wrote on about June 29, 1763: \"Could it not be contrived to send the smallpox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\" Bouquet responded to Amherst (summer of 1763):\n\"P.S. I will try to inocculate [sic] the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself. As it is pity to oppose good men against them, I wish we could make use of the Spaniard's Method, and hunt them with English Dogs. Supported by Rangers, and some Light Horse, who would I think effectively extirpate or remove that Vermine.\"\nAmherst replied:\n\"P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate [sic] the Indians by means of Blankets, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race. I should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect, but England is at too great a Distance to think of that at present.\"\nOfficers at the besieged Fort Pitt had already attempted to do what Amherst and Bouquet were discussing. During a parley at Fort Pitt on June 24, 1763, Ecuyer gave Delaware representatives, Turtleheart and Mamaltee, two blankets and a handkerchief that had been exposed to smallpox, hoping to spread the disease to the Native Americans in order to \"extirpate\" them from the territory. William Trent, the militia commander, left records that showed the purpose of giving the blankets was \"to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.\" Turtleheart and Killbuck would later represent the Delaware at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.\nOn July 22, Trent writes, \"Gray Eyes, Wingenum, Turtle's Heart and Mamaultee, came over the River told us their Chiefs were in Council, that they waited for Custaluga who they expected that Day\". There are eyewitness reports that outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases had plagued the Ohio Native Americans in the years before the siege of Fort Pitt. Colonists also caught smallpox from Native Americans at a peace conference in 1759 which then led to an epidemic in Charleston and the surrounding areas in South Carolina.\nHistorians cannot agree how much damage the attempt to spread smallpox at Fort Pitt caused. Historian Francis Jennings concluded that the attempt was \"unquestionably successful and effective\" and inflicted great damage to the Native Americans. Historian Michael McConnell writes that, \"Ironically, British efforts to use pestilence as a weapon may not have been either necessary or particularly effective\", noting that smallpox was already entering the territory by several means, and Native Americans were familiar with the disease and good at isolating the infected. Historians widely agree that smallpox devastated the Native American population. It is estimated that 400,000\u2013500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans died during and years after the Pontiac's War, mostly from smallpox,\nBushy Run and Devil's Hole.\nOn August 1, 1763, most of the Native Americans broke off the siege at Fort Pitt in order to intercept 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at the Battle of Bushy Run. Although his force suffered heavy casualties, Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20, bringing the siege to an end. His victory at Bushy Run was celebrated in the British colonies\u2014church bells rang through the night in Philadelphia\u2014and praised by King George.\nThis victory was soon followed by a costly defeat. Fort Niagara, one of the most important western forts, was not assaulted, but on September 14, 1763, at least 300 Senecas, Ottawas, and Ojibwas attacked a supply train along the Niagara Falls portage. Two companies sent from Fort Niagara to rescue the supply train were also defeated. More than 70 soldiers and teamsters were killed in these actions, which Anglo-Americans called the \"Devil's Hole Massacre\", the deadliest engagement for British soldiers during the war.\nPaxton Boys.\nThe violence and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that came to be known as the Paxton Boys. They had this name because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans\u2014many of them Christians\u2014who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.\nThe Paxton Boys then set their sights on other Native Americans living within eastern Pennsylvania, many of whom fled to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764, where the presence of British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from committing more violence. Benjamin Franklin, who had helped organize the local militia, negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the immediate crisis. Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. \"If an \"Indian\" injures me,\" he asked, \"does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all \"Indians\"?\" One leader of the Paxton Boys was Lazarus Stewart who would be killed in the Wyoming Massacre of 1778.\nBritish response, 1764\u20131766.\nIn spring and summer of 11764, there were more Native American raids on frontier settlements that usual. The hardest hit colony that year was Virginia. In July, four Delaware Indian soldiers killed and scalped a school teacher and ten children in what is now Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War: money was paid for every Native killed above the age of ten, including women.\nThe Board of Trade held General Amherst responsible for the uprising. As a consequence, he was recalled to London in August 1763. Major General Thomas Gage replaced him. In 1764, Gage sent two expeditions into the west to crush the rebellion, rescue British prisoners, and arrest the Native Americans responsible for the war. According to historian Fred Anderson, Gage's campaign, which had been designed by Amherst, prolonged the war for more than a year because it focused on punishing the Native Americans rather than ending the war. Gage's one significant departure from Amherst's plan was to allow William Johnson to conduct a peace treaty at Niagara, giving those Native Americans who were ready to \"bury the hatchet\" a chance to do so.\nFort Niagara treaty.\nFrom July to August 1764, Johnson negotiated a treaty at Fort Niagara. About 2,000 Native Americans were present, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had stayed out of the war, Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.\nTwo expeditions.\nAfter they had secured the area around Fort Niagara, the British launched two military expeditions into the west. The first expedition, led by Colonel John Bradstreet, was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was to subdue the Native Americans around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition, commanded by Colonel Bouquet, was to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country.\nBradstreet set out from Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 soldiers and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt that he did not have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force. When strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta instead. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been convinced to abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.\nBradstreet continued westward. He did not know yet that his unauthorized diplomacy was angering his superiors. He reached Fort Detroit on August 26, where he negotiated another treaty. In an attempt to discredit Pontiac, who was not present, Bradstreet chopped up a peace belt the Ottawa leader had sent to the meeting. According to historian Richard White, \"such an act, roughly equivalent to a European ambassador's urinating on a proposed treaty, had shocked and offended the gathered Indians.\" Bradstreet also claimed that the Native Americans had accepted British sovereignty as a result of his negotiations, but Johnson believed that this had not been fully explained to the Native Americans and that further councils would be needed. Although Bradstreet had successfully reinforced and reoccupied British forts in the region, his diplomacy proved to be controversial and inconclusive.\nColonel Bouquet was delayed in Pennsylvania while mustering the militia. He finally set out from Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, within striking distance of a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.\nTreaty with Pontiac.\nThe military conflict essentially ended with the 1764 expeditions. Some Native Americans still called for resistance in the Illinois Country, where British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French. A Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kask\u00e9 emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kask\u00e9 traveled as far south as New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.\nIn 1765, the British decided that the occupation of the Illinois Country could only be accomplished by diplomatic means. As Gage commented to one of his officers, he was determined to have \"none our enemy\" among the Indian peoples, and that included Pontiac, to whom he now sent a wampum belt suggesting peace talks. Pontiac had by now become less militant after hearing of Bouquet's truce with the Ohio country Native Americans. Johnson's deputy, George Croghan,\u00a0travelled to the Illinois country in the summer of 1765. Even thogh he was injured along the way in an attack by Kickapoos and Mascoutens, he managed to meet and negotiate with Pontiac. While Charlot Kask\u00e9 wanted to burn Croghan at the stake, Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York, where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at Fort Ontario on July 25, 1766. It was hardly a surrender: no lands were ceded, no prisoners returned, and no hostages were taken. Rather than accept British sovereignty, Kask\u00e9 left British territory by crossing the Mississippi River with other French and Native refugees.\nLegacy.\nThe total loss of life resulting from Pontiac's War is unknown. About 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured, a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers \"killed\". The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee from their homes. Native American losses went mostly unrecorded.\nPontiac's War has traditionally been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans. Scholars now usually view it as a military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts: They forced the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.\nRelations between British colonists and Native Americans, which had been severely strained during the French and Indian War, reached a new low during Pontiac's Rebellion. According to historian David Dixon, \"Pontiac's War was unprecedented for its awful violence, as both sides seemed intoxicated with genocidal fanaticism.\" Historian Daniel Richter characterizes the Native attempt to drive out the British, and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Native Americans from their midst, as parallel examples of ethnic cleansing. People on both sides of the conflict had come to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans were inherently different and could not live with each other. According to Richter, the war saw the emergence of \"the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other.\"\nThe British government also came to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans must be kept apart. On October 7, 1763, the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, an effort to reorganize British North America after the Treaty of Paris. The Proclamation had already been worked on when Pontiac's War erupted. It was hurriedly issued after news of the uprising reached London. Officials drew a boundary line between the British colonies along the seaboard, and Native American lands west of the Allegheny Ridge (i.e., the Eastern Divide). This created a vast 'Indian Reserve' that stretched from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River and from Florida to Quebec. It also confirmed the demarcation line that had been set before the war by the Treaty of Easton in 1758. By forbidding colonists from trespassing on Native lands, the British government hoped to avoid more conflicts like Pontiac's Rebellion. \"The Royal Proclamation,\" writes historian Colin Calloway, \"reflected the notion that segregation not interaction should characterize Indian-white relations.\"\nThe effects of Pontiac's War lasted for a long time. Because the Proclamation officially recognized that indigenous people had certain rights to the lands they occupied, it has been called the Native Americans' \"Bill of Rights\", and still informs the relationship between the Canadian government and First Nations. For British colonists and land speculators, however, the Proclamation seemed to deny them the fruits of victory\u2014western lands\u2014that had been won in the war with France. The resentment which this created undermined colonial attachment to the Empire. It also contributed to the coming of the American Revolution. According to Colin Calloway, \"Pontiac's Revolt was not the last American war for independence\u2014American colonists launched a rather more successful effort a dozen years later, prompted in part by the measures the British government took to try to prevent another war like Pontiac's.\"\nFor Native Americans, Pontiac's War demonstrated the possibilities of cooperation between tribes for resisting colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, and was the first war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War."}

Chuang (family name) played for a short time in the German national league. 2013 he won the World Championships in the doubles.\nSporting career.\nBeginning with table tennis and caming to the Taiwanese National team (1986-1998).\nChuang began to play table tennis very early because his parents and his older brother played, too. At the age of eight he had his first appearances, for example the Mini-championships in Taiwan. As the parents saw the talent of their son, Chuang got a coach and his parents tranied him, too. 1993 Chuang traveled (to the table tennis capital) China. This moving was no easy decision for his mother Li Gumei, but it doesn't get back at home. And to that time the family Chuang wasn't very rich. Chuang had to train in very hot gyms and sportclubs. The working had success: In 1998 he got to the Taiwanese National team.\nFirst success and changing to Germany (1999-2002).\nAfter gotting in the National team he played only one year later his first World Tour tournament, at the Austrian Open he reached in the singles and doubles the quarterfinals and makes with that headlines. In the same year (1999) he was nominated from coaches and players to come to Germany. The hard times for mother and son became further. It was difficult for Chuang to be a friend of German table tennis players because he doens't spoke German. Moreover he had no assistent for matches and in the training, so he had no coach.

For example a musician who writes a song is paid a royalty each time the song is played on the radio, or each time another musician plays the song. The owner can allow other people to use their asset by paying a license or a franchise. The amount paid is usually a percentage of the all the money made from using the asset, the gross, or from the just the profit, the net. Another way is to set a fixed price, for example a set amount for each book or recording. There are many other ways that the royalty fee can be calculated and paid. A royalty interest is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.\nA license agreement defines the terms for these payments. The agreement can also set conditions for how, where and when an asset can be used. License agreements can also be regulated. A government of a country might receive royalty payments for mining, or extracting oil, and would protect its interest in the agreement with laws."}

They are people, usually paid, who promote something while pretending to be independent.\nShills publicly help or give credibility to a person or organization with which they have a private relationship. Shills operate in media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also discredit opponents or critics of their client by character assassination or other means.\nUsually, \"shill\" refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, or \"marks\", the impression of an enthusiastic customer. They pretend independence of the seller, marketer or \"con artist\", for whom they are secretly working. \nThe shill works for \"the man\" who does the tricks to extract money from the onlookers. The arena can be as basic as a street three-shell game, or as complex as a massive stock exchange fraud. All it takes is someone who looks like a fellow player to show big appreciation of the seller's product.\nThe shill and his client (\"the man\") rely on crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to do business with the seller or accept the ideas they are promoting. With a big audience, such as a magician's show or a political rally, there are placed people in the audience very often. Then the shill is called a plant or stooge.\nWhat the shill does is similar or identical to what advertising and public relations do. However, it is more obvious that the latter have a vested interest because everyone knows they are being paid for their work. Another place for shilling is the many web auctions."}

On the evening of Wednesday, June 3, a slow-moving supercell thunderstorm developed over Nebraska.\nThe result was the most unusual in American weather history: these storms moved at 8 mph, some of these tornadoes were anticyclonic, and they didn't move in a straight line, with some looping back around. Tornado warnings were issued.\n5 people were killed and 200 were injured. June 3 is known as The Night of the Twisters, which is a book written by Ivy Ruckman in 1984, and a movie that premiered on February 14, 1996 on The Family Channel (now Freeform)."}

It was located on land that was claimed by New York and New Hampshire. It had its own postal system, military, and currency. Even though it had a government, it was not respected by England or the Continental Congress.\nHistory.\nNew York and New Hampshire both claimed that Vermont was in their control. This argument was caused by the New Hampshire Grants. The governor of New Hampshire wrote 135 grants giving 6 square miles of land each to create towns. New York also made grants in the same areas.\nIn January 1777 it was made independent as \"New Connecticut\". In June, the name was changed to \"Vermont\". On July 2, 1777, representatives of nearby Vermont towns met in Windsor. They wanted to leave New York and form their own country under a new constitution. The Vermont Constitution was designed to be like the Pennsylvania Constitution, and was very democratic. Adult slavery was banned in Vermont. This made Vermont the first state to not allow slavery. They gave all adult males the right to vote. In the past, only people who owned land could vote. The constitution outlined how eminent domain would work in Vermont, which is where the government can take private property if they pay the owners. It also ordered public schools to be made.\nVermont sent representatives to the United States, the Netherlands, and France to try to discuss peace and trade. They wanted to join the United States as the fourteenth state. Money made in 1785 and 1786 said \"STELLA QUARTA DECIMA\" on it, which means \"the fourteenth star\" in Latin.\nNew York did not want Vermont to become a state because they still said the land was their own. In 1790, representatives of both states met and decided that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New York in exchange for New York respecting the border between the two states at Lake Champlain. After this, Vermont became the 14th state in 1791. At that time, the population was about 85,000.\nGreen Mountain Boys.\nThe Green Mountain Boys were the militia and only military force of Vermont. They began in 1775 after an argument about land between New York and New Hampshire. \nThe militia was lead by Major General Ethan Allen, who was born in Vermont and was in the military from 1757 (British Army) until 1780 (Vermont militia).\nIn 1780, 300 soldiers of the Green Mountain Boys defended against 307 British and Iroquois soldiers in the Royalton raid. The British and Iroquois attacked Vermont as a part of many raids by the British in the American Revolutionary War.\nThe Green Mountain Boys fought with the Continental Army in the Battle of Ticonderoga and the Battle of Bennington."}

It was part of\u00a0 the \"Second French intervention in Mexico\". The Mexican Army won over the occupying French soldiers.\nThe French eventually overran the Mexicans in other battles. However, the Mexican victory at Puebla against a much better equipped and larger French army gave a morale boost to the Mexican army. It\u00a0 also slowed the French army's advance towards Mexico City.\nBackground.\nThe 1858\u201360 Mexican civil war (known as the \"Reform War\") caused major distress in Mexico's economy. When he was elected president in 1861, Benito Ju\u00e1rez was forced to stop payments of interest on foreign debts for two years.\nAt the end of October 1861 diplomats from Spain, France, and Britain met in London to form the Tripartite Alliance. The main purpose of this alliance was to launch an allied invasion of Mexico, to take control of Veracruz, its major port. The idea was to force the Mexican government to negotiate terms for repaying its debts and for reparations for harm to foreign citizens in Mexico. In December 1861, Spanish troops landed in Veracruz; British and French followed in early January.\nThe allied forces occupied Veracruz and advanced to Orizaba. The Tripartite Alliance fell apart by early April 1862, when it became clear the French wanted to impose harsh demands on the Juarez government and provoke a war. The British and Spanish withdrew, leaving the French to march alone on Mexico City. Napoleon III wanted to set up a puppet Mexican regime."}

It reaches north to Choa Chu Kang, south to Jurong Pier, west to Peng Kang Hill and east to Pandan Reservoir. The line will be the seventh MRT line to be built. \nThe JRL is the third MRT line in Singapore to be constructed with tracks that are above ground, after the East West Line and the North South Line, and the first MRT line to be built fully above ground, with no parts that are underground or at the ground level.\nThe line is colored turquoise on the MRT Rail map.\nOverview.\nThe line mainly serves Jurong and the nearby areas. The line is split into three parts, or branches:\nTrains starting at Choa Chu Kang will end at Jurong Pier. Trains starting at Jurong Pier will end at Peng Kang Hill. Lastly, trains starting at Peng Kang Hill will go towards Choa Chu Kang, with Bahar Junction as an interchange point for the 3 services. People who want to change to trains on the east branch can only do so at Tengah. \nStudies for an extension to connect the east branch to the Circle Line at Haw Par Villa are being done.\nHistory.\nBeginnings and developments.\nAs early as 1996, plans were made to allow a railway to go to the Nanyang Technological University, from the rest of Singapore. The white paper published by the Land Transport Authority showed that a Light Rail Transit line would run west of Boon Lay station on the East West line towards the university. The JRL was created as a concept, but was dropped because not many people were expected to use the line at that time.\nHowever, in 2013, the JRL was announced again, as a Mass Rapid Transit line that would run from Choa Chu Kang, crossing Boon Lay and Tengah, Jurong East, Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong West.\nDetails of the line were announced on 9 May 2018, as a 24-kilometre line with 24 stations. The Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange, 1 HDB block, and Pioneer Primary School will all be taken by the government for the building of the line.\nJRL will start opening in 3 phases from 2026 to 2028.\nSystem.\nThe JRL has 24 kilometres (15 mi) of tracks, with 24 stations. There are four branches: to Choa Chu Kang in the north, Jurong Pier in the south, Pandan Reservoir in the east and Peng Kang Hill in the west.\nDepot.\nThere will be a depot at Tengah and a parking area near Peng Kang Hill station to support the operations of the JRL. Rolling stock will be kept at both locations, which will have parking areas for JRL trains. The Tengah Depot, which will also house the JRL Operations Control Centre, will have a bus depot and a workers\u2019 sleeping area combined with it to use the land better. The Peng Kang Hill parking area is located near Peng Kang Hill station, while Tengah depot is located along the western side of Tengah.\nRolling stock.\nThe JRL is operated by three-car trains that can be made to become four cars when the number of people using the line goes up. Each car is 18.6 metres long by 2.75 metres wide, which is smaller than those used on other MRT lines because the JRL is above ground and the trains have to run along places with many buildings.\nProposed developments.\nWest Coast extension.\nThis proposed extension from West Coast to Haw Par Villa via Pasir Panjang would connect the JRL to the Circle line and improve the ability to travel between the western part of Singapore and the Central Business District. It would support the future developments along the JRL, and increase the strength of the Mass Rapid Transit network. New stations would be added in West Coast and Pasir Panjang. The plan was announced in 2015, and as of 2017, studies are ongoing for the proposed extension. If built, the extension would be ready in 2030."}

Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted. The killer originated the name \"Zodiac\" in a series of taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press.

They describe the relative height of land above sea level.\nUplands have rivers and streams which are fast-flowing, clear, and with plenty of oxygen. They drain high or mountainous country, and go down into broad plains (where they become lowland rivers. Lowlands usually have warmer, slow-flowing waters carrying lots of sediment and with poor oxygen content.\nUpland rivers run fast and cut through rock (Colorado River). Lowland rivers meander slowly towards the coast (Mississippi River). They carry lots of soil and are a dark colour. Therefore the fish and other animals which live in the river are quite different according to the two stages or types of river.\nThe terms also apply to large areas of land. Because mountain-building (orogeny) lifts up huge sections of the Earth, there are large areas which are well above sea level: the highlands. But on the trailing edge of a continent, the land is low. So the Americas are (broadly speaking) high on the west (the American Cordillera) and low on the east (Amazon, St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin, Mississippi, and La Plata). This is a consequence of plate tectonics, as the Americas have moved slowly west for over 100 million years. The Appalachians are a far older chain of ground-down mountains carried along by the continent as it moved west.\nThe same pattern can be seen in other continents, especially with great rivers such as the Congo and the Indus. Australia is the exception: its mountain ranges are very ancient and worn down. Recent plate tectonics there has not been so significant as elsewhere."}

The code was drafted on 6th October 1860. on the recommendation of first law commission of india established in 1834 under the charter Act of 1833 under the chairmanship of Thomas Babington Macaulay.It came into force in British India during the early British Raj period in 1862.

The Code has been amended several times and is now supplemented by other criminal provisions.\nAfter the Partition of the British Indian Empire, the Indian Penal Code was inherited by its successor states, the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan (where it continues as the Pakistan Penal Code). The Ranbir Penal Code (RPC) for Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir is also based on this code. After the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, the code continued in force there.

The main law on nationality, the Pakistan Citizenship Act, was passed by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 13 April 1951. Pakistan is the only country in Asia with unconditional \"jus soli\" citizenship rights.\nCitizenship.\nBefore the creation of Pakistan, it was part of the British Indian Empire which also included India and Bangladesh. The people were British subjects. Pakistan was founded on 14 August 1947 as a state for Muslims. It was a Dominion in the British Commonwealth. Pakistan then included modern-day Bangladesh, which was known as East Bengal and East Pakistan. Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. After independence in 1947, several millions of Muslims emigrated to Pakistan from India, and several millions of Hindus and Sikhs who had been living in Pakistan emigrated to India. This raised a number of citizenship issues.\nPakistani Citizenship Act 1951.\nThe Pakistan Citizenship Act became law on 13 April 1951. Its purpose was \"to make provision for citizenship of Pakistan\". The Act has been amended several times, the last time in 2000. The Act is divided into 23 sections, each one about a different provision of citizenship.\nDual Pakistani nationality.\nSince independence, many Pakistanis have moved to live in the Middle East, Europe and North America. This has led to several changes in Pakistani nationality law. Dual citizenship is allowed in certain cases:\nPakistanis with dual citizenship can not hold public office, sit in the assemblies, contest elections or join the Pakistani military.\nProblems.\nBoth Pakistan and India claim to the disputed region of Kashmir. This has been the subject of several wars between the two countries. The Pakistani Citizenship Act of 1951 allowed persons who were subjects of the state of Jammu and Kashmir to travel under a Pakistani passport and be considered a citizen of Pakistan.\nThe independence of Bangladesh in 1971 led to around half a million \"stranded Pakistanis\". These people trace their heritage to the Bihar region. Despite official promises, Bangladesh refuses to accept them as citizens. Conversely, a continuous migration of Bangladeshis between 1971 and 1995 led their population increasing to more 1.6 million. There were only 10,000 at the time of separation. The migrants are mostly illegal and are not given the citizenship, as they migrated after the separation.\nFor political and other reasons, the 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan are not given Pakistani nationality, even though most of them were born in Pakistan."}

By using this new term, Leigh wanted to avoid the negative connotations. Sex work is paid work in the industry, such as prostitution, erotic dancing, and starring in pornographic movies. It does not refer to related illegal activities, such as human trafficking or other non-consensual sex.\nIt is difficult to say how many sex workers there are. This is because of the stigma of being a sex worker. In addition, most academic work focuses on prostitution, escorts and exotic dancing; there is little research on other forms of sex work.\nGender differences.\nInterviews with men and women escorts show gender differences in these escorts' experiences. On average, women escorts charged much more than men. Compared to traditional women escorts, women in niche markets charged lower rates. However, this difference in rates did not exist for men escorts. Men escorts reported widespread acceptance in the gay community; they were much more likely to tell about their occupation. This community acceptance is fairly unusual to the gay community and not the experience of many women sex workers. Also, heterosexual men prostitutes are much more likely than heterosexual women prostitutes to entertain same-gender clients because they need to: most clients are men. In general, there is a greater social expectation for women to engage in emotional labor than there is for men; there are also greater consequences if they do not."}

The lighthouse is built between the Pacific Ocean and the Taiwan Strait and it faces toward the Luzon Strait. The lighthouse is open to the public for the whole year. The lighthouse is sometimes called \"The Light of East Asia\", because its intensity is very powerful.\nHistory.\nEluanbi Lighthouse was built in 1883. It was built by the Qing Dynasty. It was built because a lot of accidents happened in this area. Ships crashed into the reefs in the waters nearby. The Qing Dynasty wanted to prevent accidents like the Rover Incident. W. F. Spindey, who was an English architect that was part of the Royal Geographical Society was hired to build this lighthouse. The lighthouse is the only one in Taiwan that is armed. It has a trench around it and a lot of gun holes in the wall. This was needed because many of the local Aboriginal people raided the lighthouse a lot.\nAfter the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taiwan became a part of the Empire of Japan. Damage on the lighthouse from the First Sino-Japanese War was fixed in 1898 by the Japanese. In World War II, the lighthouse became damaged again during the Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa.\nThe lighthouse was rebuilt in 1962. It still works and is a historical monument in Kenting National Park. Next to the lighthouse there is also a memorial of the \"Taiwan Eight Magnificent Sceneries\"."}

It is not a very efficient method compared to other algorithms such as quicksort. However, it is a very simple algorithm that is easy to build.\nThink about the sequence of numbers in the picture below. It starts with a small number (written as \u2264x), then a big number (\u2265x) and then a medium sized number (written as x). If this had specific numbers, it might start with 2 (small), 10 (big), 4 (medium). The number 10 is bigger than the number 4. So if the sequence were in order from smallest to biggest, it should start with 2, 4, 10. So the second and third numbers should be swapped. So, in the example below, the sequence should start with \u2264x, x, \u2265x. \nWhen the sequence it sorted, the medium number is moved in between the small (\u2264x) and big (\u2265x) numbers.

This concept describes how a gas usually behaves, in different settings. A bose gas is the analogous concept in quantum mechanics. \nA bose gas is made of bosons with a positive spin value. These bosons also follow the Bose-Einstein statistics. The statistical mechanics of bosons were developed by Satyendra Nath Bose for photons. Albert Einstein extended the theory, when he realized that an ideal gas of bosons would form a condensate at a low enough temperature. This condensate is known as a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.

Beavis and Butt-head are the main characters in the movie. They're played by Mike Judge. The teenage boys are from the fictional town of Highland, Texas.\nPlot.\nAfter a dream of the two of them terrorizing the city as giants, Beavis and Butt-Head wake up and realize somebody has stolen their television. The pair then go on a mission to find the stolen television. After several accidents, they visit a low-quality motel that says \"TVs in every room\". There, they meet a man named Muddy Grimes. Grimes is waiting for two hired hitmen to murder his wife Dallas. They're later found to be the same people who stole the television. Muddy thinks that the \"killers\" are younger than he originally thought. He says they must \"do\" (in other words: murder) his wife. But the boys think that by \"do\", Muddy actually made a euphemism for performing sex on his wife. Butt-Head convinces Beavis both of them can \"score\" (in other words: have sex) \"and\" get paid enough money for buying a new television. Grimes then gives Beavis and Butt-Head a photo of Dallas with instructions on where to find her. Then, Grimes drives them to the airport to get on an airplane to Las Vegas, Nevada.\nAfter arriving at the casino where they're staying, Beavis and Butt-Head are arrested by security. But then they're taken to their rooms. Their room was purchased by Muddy to be next to Dallas' room. The two boys come in. Dallas then realizes they have no idea what they were hired for. Beavis and Butt-Head begin fighting over who will \"do\" her first. Dallas gets arrested by police. But she thinks fast, and plants a stolen biological weapon, the X-5 Unit, in Beavis' pants just to get rid of it.\nThe next day, Beavis and Butt-Head are found by Muddy. He plans to kill them because they were not the hitmen he hired. But when he hears that Dallas will meet up with the duo in Washington, D.C., Muddy decides to take them the rest of the way in his trunk and hunt down Dallas. In the middle of Interstate 81 in Virginia, Butt-Head opens the car trunk by using a car jack. He and Beavis escape, though they cause a multiple-car accident. They casually walk past the scene and get back on the tour bus.\nBeavis and Butt-Head stop at the Capitol. They finally reach the White House.\nButt-Head runs into Chelsea Clinton. He tries flirting with her. He's then pushed out a window. ATF agents hold him.\nBeavis leaves the White House and goes to Mr. Anderson's trailer. But Anderson catches Beavis and kicks him out for \"whacking off\" (in other words, masturbating). The ATF spots Beavis walking around Anderson's camper. They're just about to shoot their guns. But Anderson opens the camper's door. He throws out Beavis' pants. The pants are ripped open by the ATF. The weapon flies from them. It lands safely in Butt-Head's hand and is recovered. Anderson is arrested, along with Dallas and Muddy.\nBeavis and Butt-Head return to Highland, Texas. They find their television near the front of the motel. The movie ends as they insult one another and carry their TV into the sunset.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe movie went to theaters in North America on December 20, 1996. It made over $63.1 million at the U.S. box office. It opened at #1 with $20 million.
