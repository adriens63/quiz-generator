Scientists have seen it no more than 750 meters above sea level.\nAppearance.\nThe adult male frog is 4.3 to 6.7 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 7.4 to 8.8 cm long.\nThis frog has a mix of dark green and light green on its back, with pale blue spots. It has yellow-orange sides with thick black stripes. It has a small yellow spot behind each eye. The spot is covered up when the frog is still. Unlike \"Cruziohyla calcarifer\", it does not have dark brown marks on its underside.\nEggs and tadpoles.\nThe female frog lays her eggs on leaves or branches hanging over small bodies of water, for example pools of water in hollow trees. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water.\nThreats.\nThis frog is not endangered, and people have seen more of them than there were before. However, they are still in some danger because human beings change the forests where they live into farms and other things and cut down trees for the wood. This is called habitat loss."}

The alary process of the premaxilla does not split into two pieces like it does in some other frogs.\nTaxonomy.\nScientists first invented \"Sarcohyla\" in 2016 using molecular data.

The superfamily Hyloidea started when the ancestor of all its frogs and toads evolved differently from the other animals in the suborder Neobatrachia. This happened at about the same time as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction 66 million years ago. Scientists have found some fossils from this time but not enough to tell how this event affected these animals. After this extinction event, more forests grew, so the frogs may have changed so they could climb and live in trees.\nHyloidea has many subgroups:\nShared Characteristics of Hyloidea.\nHyloidea is the largest superfamily of anurans due to scientists placing frogs into this family when the relationships to others are unknown. Therefore, Hyloidea has the highest species diversity. Hyloidea are all tailless, have shortened bodies, large mouths and muscular hind legs. Most anurans in the superfamily have a lateral\u2010bender which is a type of pelvis morphology found in walking, hopping and burrowing frogs. Some species that appear later in the taxon have a sagittal\u2010hinge pelvis found in aquatic frogs as well as walking, hopping and burrowing frogs and some have a fore\u2013aft slider pelvis found in terrestrial frogs. Hyloidea anurans lack ribs, have complex mouthparts, and their pectoral girdle can be arciferal or firmisternal. They reproduce via axillary amplexus, and their larvae usually have a single spiracle. The average snout-vent length (SVL) of Hyloidea species vary widely, from 10 mm in one species of \"Diasporus\" to 320 mm in female \"Calyptocephalella gayi\". \nPhylogenic relationships.\nAnuran animals, frogs and toads, look alike from the outside, so scientists cannot always tell them apart by looking at their morphological characteristics. They use DNA testing to tell which species are related to each other and how. ML analysis and Bayesian analysis are two important ways to do this. Scientists used them with a nuclear marker toolkit to look at the relationships inside the superfamily Hyloidea on a molecular level. As they tested 55 relationships of the Hyloidea and was found that 53 out of the 55 previously established nodes on the phylogenetic tree were supported by this DNA testing.\nDistribution.\nScientists say the first Hyloidea animals evolved on the Gondwanan supercontinent in what is now southern South America, then spread throughout the world. Today, they live on every continent except Antarctica. In 2020, scientists found a fossilized animal that was roughly 40 million year old. The animal was from the hyloid family Calyptocephalellidae, and the fossil was found on Seymour Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The distribution of Hyloidea species is highly correlated with climate, with most species found in areas with higher annual mean temperatures.\nConservation.\nAs of February 2021, the IUCN Red List named 361 of the species in Hyloidea as critically endangered (11.4%), 475 as endangered (15%), and 310 as vulnerable (9.8%). There are 3161 species in Hyloidea. One of the most important reasons Hyloidea species are dying is because human beings build farms and other things in the places where they live. This is called habitat loss."}

According to political historian Ervand Abrahamian, \"whereas less than 100 political prisoners had been executed between 1971 and 1979, more than 7900 were executed between 1981 and 1985. ... the prison system was centralized and drastically expanded ... Prison life was drastically worse under the Islamic Republic than under the Pahlavis. The state of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran has been criticized by Iranians and international human right activists, by writers, and NGOs. The United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Commission\nLGBT issues.\nHomosexual acts and adultery are criminal and punishable by life imprisonment or death after multiple offenses, and the same sentences apply to convictions for treason and apostasy. Iran is one of seven countries in the world that apply the death penalty for homosexual acts; all of them justify this punishment with Islamic law. The Judiciary does not recognize the concept of sexual orientation, and thus from a legal standpoint there are no homosexuals or bisexuals, only heterosexuals committing homosexual acts. For some years after the Iranian Revolution, transgender people were classified by the Judiciary as being homosexual and were thus subject to the same laws. However, in the mid-1980s the Judiciary began changing this policy and classifying transgender individuals as a distinct group, separate from homosexuals, granting them legal rights. Gender dysphoria is officially recognized in Iran today, and the Judiciary permits sexual reassignment surgery for those who can afford it. In the early 1960s, Ayatollah Khomeini had issued a ruling permitting gender reassignment, which has since been reconfirmed by Ayatollah Khamenei.\nCurrently, Iran has between 15,000 and 20,000 transsexuals, according to official statistics, although unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 150,000. Iran carries out more gender change operations than any country in the world besides Thailand. Sex changes have been legal since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution, passed a fatwa authorising them nearly 25 years ago. Whereas homosexuality is considered a sin, transsexuality is categorised as an illness subject to cure. While the government seeks to keep its approval quiet, state support has increased since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005. His government has begun providing grants of \u00a32,250 for operations and further funding for hormone therapy. It is also proposing loans of up to \u00a32,750 to allow those undergoing surgery to start their own businesses."}

While he was sheriff, he supported segregation, meaning he supported laws that kept white people and black people apart, almost always with black people getting fewer resources and worse conditions. He enforced anti-miscegenation laws, which forbade black people and white people from marrying each other. He is famous because of the 1949 Groveland Case. In 1951, while he was taking two of the Groveland men to their new trial, he shot them, killing one. McCall said he had shot them in self-defense. He was not charged with a crime for this.\nMcCall ran for an eighth term as sheriff in 1972, but he lost. Also in 1972, he was on trial for killing Tommy J. Vickers. Vickers was black and disabled. Like the two Groveland men, he died while he was McCall's prisoner. The jury said McCall was not guilty of Vickers' death.\nIn the 1980s, a road in Umatilla was named Willis McCall Road. In 2007, every member of the Lake County Commission voted to change the name. They said it was because he was a \"bully lawman whose notorious tenure was marked by charges of racial intolerance, brutality and murder.\" During his 28 years as sheriff, McCall was investigated multiple times for breaking civil rights rules and laws and for abusing prisoners. He was tried for murder but was never found guilty.\nEarly life.\nWillis McCall was born in Umatilla, Lake County, Florida. He was the son of a dirt farmer from Alabama (born c. 1877) and a woman named Pearl (born c. 1886).\nCareer.\nMcCall was first elected Sheriff of Lake County in 1944. He was re-elected until 1972. \"At 6 feet 1 and weighing more than 200 pounds, McCall loomed large as Lake sheriff from 1945 until 1972. He wore a white felt hat, black string tie, and polished boots.\" In 1972, Guy Bliss defeated McCall in the election for sheriff.\nGroveland Four.\nOn July 16, 1949, Norma Padgett, a 17-year-old married white woman in Groveland, Florida, said that she had been raped by four young black men. Police arrested 16-year-old Charles Greenlee, Sam Shepherd, 22; and Walter Irvin, 22, and put them in jail until their trial. Shepherd and Irvin were both US Army veterans. Sheriff McCall had traveled out of Florida at that time but he came back the next day. Newspapers all over the United States wrote about the Groveland case, and they wrote about McCall often.\nA fourth suspect, Ernest Thomas, ran out of Lake County, so he was not arrested. However, a Sheriff's posse ran after him. They shot and killed him about 200 miles northwest of Lake County in Madison County. The coroner said he could not tell which person in the posse had killed Thomas because he had been shot about 400 times.\nAs word spread about the alleged rape, an angry crowd of white peoples came to the county jail. The jailhouse was in Tavares. The people in the crowd told McCall to give them the three suspects so they could hang them illegally. But two of the three men were not in the building. McCall had taken Shepherd and Irvin to his own house in Eustis, Florida and he had hidden them in the basement. He then moved them to Raiford State Prison, he said, to keep them safe.\nThe mob headed toward Groveland, where two of the suspects and their families lived. The mob continued to make trouble. On the third day, McCall and several prominent businessmen warned the black residents to leave town until things settled, and many of them did. McCall called the Florida Governor asking him to send National Guard troops to Lake County; when the troops arrived in Groveland, the mob had already burned several buildings to the ground, including the family home of Sam Shepherd.\nA grand jury indicted the three rape suspects. Shepherd and Greenlee later told FBI investigators that deputies beat them until they lied and said they had raped the woman. US Attorney Herbert Phillips did not indict Lake County Sheriff's Deputies James Yates or Leroy Campbell for this.\nLater, experts looked closely at the trial. They found it was full of legal problems. Before the trial, McCall had told journalists that two men had confessed. The journalists wrote about this in their newspapers. One newspaper had a large drawing on the front page. The jury had only white men and not even one black person. The jury quickly convicted all three men. The judge sentenced Shepherd and Irvin to death. Because Greenlee was 16 and not an adult, he was sentenced to life in prison. In 1951, the US Supreme Court overturned Lake County's conviction of Shepherd and Irvin on the grounds that it was not right that there had been no blacks people on the jury. (Most blacks were still disenfranchised by the state constitution and racist laws and rules in the segregated Jim Crow state; because they could not vote, they were not eligible to sit on juries.)\nThis did not mean that Shepherd and Irvin were freed. Instead, they were to have a new trial. In November 1951, McCall was personally driving Shepherd and Irvin from Raiford to Tavares for the retrial. He pulled off to a country road. He said there was something wrong with one of the vehicle's tires. McCall shot both men. Shepherd died there by the roadside, but Irvin lived. Deputy James Yates showed up and shot Irvin again.\nMcCall later swore in a deposition that Shepherd and Irvin attacked him so they could try to escape. He said that he shot them both in self-defense. But the prisoners had both been handcuffed to each other.\nAmbulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall was treated for a concussion and facial injuries and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital, Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in a 2012 book that the FBI had located a bullet in the soil ten inches below the blood stain where Irvin had lain wounded. This supported Irvin's claim that Yates fired at him from nearly point-blank range.\nA Lake County coroner's inquest said that McCall had not done anything wrong. Judge Truman Futch ruled that he saw no need to impanel a grand jury, which means McCall was not indicted (formally accused) for any crime. After Irvin recovered from the shooting, his retrial was moved to Marion County, just north of Lake County. It began in February 1952. He was offered a plea bargain, meaning he would get a lighter punishment if he confessed to the rape. But Irvin refused to plead guilty, instead saying he was innocent. The jury found Irvin guilty, and the judge sentenced him to death again. The case was appealed, but the conviction was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court. In early 1954, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case.\nPeople who believed Irvin asked the governor of Florida for clemency. In the United States, a governor can let a prisoner go even if a jury has convicted that person. Newly elected Governor LeRoy Collins looked at the evidence himself. In 1955, he commuted Irvin's sentence to life in prison, saying that he did not believe that the state established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Greenlee, who did not appeal his case, was paroled in 1962 and Irvin was paroled in 1968. Irvin died in 1969 while visiting Lake County. Greenlee moved with his wife and daughter to Tennessee, where his son was born a few years later. Greenlee lived until 2012.\n1951 Harry T. Moore bombing.\nHarry T. Moore, executive director of the Florida NAACP, challenged segregation and law enforcement. In the 1940s and the early 1950s, he helped tens of thousands of blacks register to vote. Before this, most of the black people in Florida had been disfranchised because of the state constitution written at the turn of the century. After the Groveland case, Moore asked the governor to suspend McCall from office and investigate whether he had abused prisoners. Six weeks later, a bomb exploded in Moore's house in Mims in Brevard County, under the bedroom. Moore and his wife both died. It was Christmas 1952. Rumors said McCall had planned the bombing. The FBI looked for at the time and years later, and the Justice Department looked for evidence too, but none of these investigations found any proof McCall helped in the bombing.\nIn 2005, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began a new investigation of the Moore bombing. This was different from earlier investigations, because teams would dig under the house for new forensic evidence. On August 16, 2006, Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist announced his office had completed its 20-month investigation. They named four now-dead suspects: Earl Brooklyn, Tillman Belvin, Joseph Cox and Edward Spivey. All four had a long history with the Ku Klux Klan and served as officers in the Orange County Klavern. The investigators did not find any evidence that McCall had anything to do with the bombing.\nPlatt children.\nIn 1954, the Lake County school board asked McCall to enforce their decision to ban five children from a segregated white public school in Mount Dora. This was because parents and teachers in the school suspected them of being \"Negro,\" meaning they thought the children were pretending to be white but were really black. (Under a one-drop law in Florida passed in the early 20th century, anyone with any African ancestry at all counted as black, even if they looked white or if far more of their ancestors had come from Europe.) In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. But many white people in the south did not want to obey the Supreme Court.\nMcCall visited the Platts' house and looked at the five children. He said they were negroes, and that they were not allowed to go to schools for white students. Official birth and marriage records all classified the Platts as white, and they were said to have Indian ancestry as well. McCall spoke to a Delaware chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of White People later that year and said whites should not allow desegregation of schools.\nBecause of threats and violence, the Platts did not have their children attend the public school. McCall arranged to have the children enrolled in the Mt. Dora Christian Home and Bible School, a private school. Because it was a private school, it did not have to obey the segregation laws. On October 18, 1955, a court ruled that the children could attend white public school. By then, the Platt family had moved away from Florida.\nIndictment for death of prisoner Tommy J. Vickers.\nIn 1972 McCall was formally accused of second-degree murder by a state grand jury. They accused him of killing Tommy J. Vickers, a mentally disabled black prisoner. Vickers died in the hospital in April 1972 of acute peritonitis after someone hit him hard in the belly. McCall was accused of kicking and beating Vickers to death after Vickers threw his food on the floor.\nGovernor Reubin Askew suspended McCall the day of the indictment, meaning he ordered McCall to stop working as sheriff. McCall was put on trial in Ocala in Marion County. Everyone on the jury was white. The trial lasted a long time and the jurors declared McCall not guilty after talking to each other for only 70 minutes. McCall returned to working as sheriff. Critics said that the all-white jury never really thought about the charges or evidence. Supporters of the sheriff said that the charges made against McCall were lies and based on politics. The presiding state judge said he thought the charges brought against McCall were false.\nLater life.\nDays after the trial for the death of Vickers, McCall lost his 1972 re-election bid. Lake County had changed during his time in office. It had many more people, including people from the north who had come to Florida to retire. McCall was said to have bragged that he had been investigated 49 times and that five different governors had tried to remove him: \"I've been accused of everything but taking a bath and called everything but a child of God,\" he like[d] to say. He retired to his home in Umatilla, Florida.\nIn 1985, the Lake County Board of County Commissioners named the road by his house, County Road 450A (CR 450A), Willis V. McCall Road in his honor. More than 20 years later, the South Umatilla Neighborhood Association, a group of black residents on the road, some of whom had lived there for 50 years, asked the Lake County Commission to change the name of the road. They said it should not honor a man who had done so many bad things. Every member of the Commission voted to change the road's name back to County Road 450A.\nLate in life, McCall wrote a memoir, a book about his life, \"The Wisdom of Willis McCall\". He defended his long career as sheriff and answered criticism. \"McCall never doubted himself, the usefulness of segregation or the morality of the methods he used to enforce law and order.\" McCall died on April 28, 1994 at the age of 84.\nFamily.\nIn 2021, McCall's son, Douglas McCall, was indicted for molesting an eight-year-old girl and for having child pornography. His trial began in October 2021."}

It was described in its Declaration of Independence as a \"Jewish state\" \u2013 the legal definition \"Jewish and democratic state\" was adopted in 1985. In addition to its Jewish majority, Israel is home to religious and ethnic minorities, some of whom report discrimination. In the Palestinian territories, successive Israeli governments have been subject to international criticism from other countries as well as international human rights groups. One of the Basic Laws of Israel, intended to form the basis of a future constitution, , is a major tool for safeguarding human rights and civil liberties in the State of Israel.\nLGBT rights.\nRights for sexual minorities in Israel are considered to be the most tolerant in the Middle East. While Israel has not legalized same-sex marriage, same-sex marriages valid in foreign countries are legally recognized in Israel. Israel guarantees civil rights for its homosexual population, including adoption rights and partner benefits. Israel also grants a common-law marriage status for same-sex domestic partners. The sodomy law inherited from the British Mandate of Palestine was repealed in 1988, though there was an explicit instruction issued in 1953 by the Attorney General of Israel ordering the police to refrain from enforcing this law, so long as no other offenses were involved. A national gay rights law bans some anti-gay discrimination, including in employment; some exemptions are made for religious organizations. In the past, military service of homosexuals was subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions were lifted in 1993, allowing homosexuals to serve openly in all units of the army.\nIn March 2014, the Ministry of Health issued a directive stating that sex-reassignment surgery was included among subsidized health services provided to citizens. Despite this, in May \"Haaretz\" reported that a health maintenance organization refused to pay for two sex-change surgeries, resulting in significant expenses by the patients.

Under the reign of Hassan II, Morocco had one of the worst human rights records in Africa and the world, especially during the time period of the Years Of Lead, which lasted from the early 1960s until the late 1980s, which was a time period in the country's history that was known for the repression of political dissent and opposition, that involved the arrests, detention, imprisonment, and even killings of political opponents. Currently, Morocco continues to face at least some human rights problems, such as poor prison conditions, the mistreatment of women and the LGBT community, and the use of torture by police. Despite the considerable improvements made under the leadership of King Mohamed VI, repression of political dissidence is still commonplace in Morocco today.\nThis article deals with Morocco and not the disputed Western Sahara. See Human rights in Western Sahara in that regard. Morocco administers 80% of the territory, hence Moroccan law applies to its \"Southern Provinces\".\nFreedom of religion.\nFreedom of religion is generally observed, with some limitations. According to the spokesman for the Moroccan government, \"the Kingdom does guarantee not only freedom of worship, but also the building of places of worship for Christians and Jews as well as performing their rituals freely and respectfully.\".\nIt is illegal to proselytize for religions other than Islam (article 220 of the Penal Code, 15 years' imprisonment).\nThere still exists a Moroccan Jewish community, although most Jews emigrated in the years following the creation of Israel in 1948.\nGovernment LGBT policy.\nNone of the major or minor political parties have made public statements in favour of LGBT-rights and no LGBT rights legislation has been enacted. Government attitudes towards homosexuality tend to be in the interests of the protection of the tradition of the country, in keeping with the culture's traditional gender roles and religious mores."}

As with the third season of \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", this mini-series adapted footage and costumes from the eighteenth Super Sentai series \"Ninja Sentai Kakuranger\".\nA sequel to called \"Power Rangers Zeo\" started in 1996.\nDuring fight scenes (and during the opening of the show) an alternate version of the MMPR theme song was played, saying \"Go Go Alien Rangers\" instead of \"Go Go Power Rangers\", although the premiere episode \"Alien Rangers of Aquitar\" still uses the \"Go Go Power Rangers\" theme.\nSynopsis.\nPicking up where the third season of \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" left off, Master Vile has used the Orb of Doom to reverse the ages of everybody on Earth, including the Power Rangers, reducing them to children. However, unlike the last time, the rangers retain their memories of the proper time thanks to the Ninja Power Coins. Unfortunately, the rangers are unable to morph and fight; Zordon recruits the Alien Rangers of the planet Aquitar for help. These Rangers are humanoid, partially aquatic aliens and though Earth's environment is ultimately inhospitable to them, they agree to help. Master Vile's plans are foiled, and he leaves in annoyance, but Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa remain and intend to conquer Earth.\nHoping to restore the Rangers' proper ages, Billy Cranston builds a Regenerator powered by the Ninja Power Coins. However, only Billy is restored to normal before the device is stolen by Goldar and Rito Revolto. The Power Coins are then destroyed by Rita and Zedd. With the human Rangers' powers destroyed, only the Aquitian Rangers stand between Earth and the forces of evil, and they can't stay on Earth forever. Ultimately, Zordon realizes that only one thing can restore everything to normal: the Zeo Crystal, which the human Rangers had split into five sub-crystals and scattered throughout time to keep it safe from Master Vile.\nThe five young Rangers are each sent back to a different country and point in time to find a sub-crystal. Upon success, they are returned to the present. All the while, the Aquitian Rangers, Billy, Zordon and Alpha 5 fend off the forces of Lord Zedd and Rita. The villains also plot to destroy the Command Center and steal the completed Zeo Crystal.\nUltimately, Zedd and Rita succeed in summoning the Aquitian Rangers' arch-foe, Hydro-Hog, to destroy them. After a great deal of difficulty, the Aquitian Rangers destroy him. Meanwhile, Aisha Campbell acquires the final sub-crystal in Africa. However, she chooses to remain in exchange for the sub-crystal and new friend Tanya Sloan goes in her place. Once the Zeo Crystal is recombined in a machine devised by Billy, Earth is restored to normal. The teenaged Rangers bid thanks and farewell to their Aquitian counterparts, who return to Aquitar. However, Goldar and Rito Revolto steal the Zeo Crystal out of the Command Center and their bomb goes off soon afterwards. The Rangers are teleported to safety just before the Command Center is destroyed.\nAftermath.\nThe series sets up the transition from \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" to \"Power Rangers Zeo\".

It's about Maxwell \"Max\" Crumbly's life in middle school, which he chronicles in his journal, which he calls The Misadventures of Max Crumbly. The series is also written in diary format just like Dork Diaries. The series currently has 3 books in it.\nCharacters.\nMaxwell \"Max\" Crumbly: The main protagonist of the series. He was first homeschooled by his grandmother until his parents agreed to send him to a public school nearby, South Ridge Middle School. Max is a kind person who is loyal to his friends but he is often a coward when it comes to Doug bullying him. His father is a comic book addict and auto repairman, and has comics worth a lot of money. His mother is a nurse and coddles her children heavily. He also has a secret crush on Erin, but in the books, he tries to deny it.\nMax has an older sister named Megan, who often annoys him, a younger brother named Oliver, who has made a few minor appearances in the Dork Diaries series, and a cousin named Wilbur, whom Max often receives hand-me-down clothing from. He is the only person in the series that has asthma and requires an inhaler. Max has bladder issues and has a secret crush on Erin. Max is fully aware about Brandon Roberts having a secret crush on Nikki Maxwell. He likes to rap about his daily life when no one hears him.Like Nikki, Max is also a talented artist. Max's biggest goal in life is to become a superhero. It is revealed in the first book of The Misadventures Of Max Crumbly that his full name is Maxwell.\nOliver: Oliver Crumbly is Mrs. Wallabanger's grandson and possible crush of Brianna Maxwell. He is the same age as her and he reminds Nikki of Brandon Roberts. Oliver seems to be shy at first but he eventually opens up when he starts talking. Oliver has a puppet called Mr Buttons, made out of a sock and loose buttons, but when lost him during his and Brianna's 'play date' he was very upset about it. Although Brianna didn't like Oliver at first they are now considered friends and possible crushes. He even made her a crumpled up, yet cute valentine. In The Misadventures Of Max Crumbly, Oliver scribbled his ABC's all over Max's Air Jordan sneakers with a permanent black marker. He is also Max's brother and his sister is Megan. Oliver has bangs and light-colored hair. His hairstyle is similar to Marcus's. He has a nice smile and wears Mr. Buttons everywhere, like Brianna does with Miss Penelope. He also appeared in the Dork Diaries series.\nMrs. Wallbanger: Mrs. Wallabanger is the Maxwell family's neighbor. She is also Oliver's and Max's grandmother. She has trouble hearing and she also appeared in the Dork Diaries series. She also has a Yorkshire Terrier dog named Creampuff.\nDoug Thurston aka Thug: Doug Thurston aka Thug is the main antagonist in the series. He is considered rude, crude, unpolite, and a bully by the main character, Max Crumbly, in the book series. Not much is known about Doug besides the fact that he is always mean to Max and repeatedly tries to make Max's life miserable. His character is analogous to MacKenzie Hollister's in the Dork Diaries series. He has a blatant crush on Erin Madison, the female counterpart of Brandon Roberts, in the Max Crumbly book series. Doug does everything he can to embarrass Max in front of Erin and desperately tries to woo her in order to gain her affections, but Erin does not return his feelings. Doug is depicted with straight hair, possibly black, and a unique eye shape. His eye shape has never been seen on another character, hinting that he may be Asian. Doug's specific appearance, such as eye and hair color, is not touched on by the books.\nMegan: Megan Crumbly is the sister of Max and Oliver Crumbly and Oliver, and is one of the characters in The Misadventures Of Max Crumbly series.\nErin Madison: Erin Madison is the female protagonist of The Misadventures of Max Crumbly. She is mentioned in one of Nikki\u2019s blogs. Erin Madison is one of the most popular girls at South Ridge Middle School, being that she is highly intelligent and headstrong. Despite her popularity, Erin seems to show genuine concern and is kind towards Max Crumbly. She is very well-spoken and speaks her mind no matter what others think. Max Crumbly has a crush on her but it is still unknown whether she returns those same feelings. Doug \"Thug\" Thurston also has a crush on her, but she is not impressed by him at all.\nShe stared at Max when Max stared at her. She helped Max with his papers when he dropped them. She was impressed by one of his pictures and told him to paint for the school play \"The ice princess\".\nShe's the princess, and the audience. She was worried the play would be canceled which became true one day. Then Thug bumped into Max and she got mad and stood up to him until he said sorry. Thug is hinted to have feelings for Erin when he said that he likes magenta which is her favorite color. When the play was announced cancelled, she was very sad and acted rude to Max, scolding him when he asked if he could help. later, she freed Max from his locker and explained why she was so sour. Later, when Max was lost, he grabbed a phone.\nThe person on the other side was Erin, who accused Max of stealing cell phones and prank calling her. she said she didn't trust him and he was probably a few fries short of a Happy Meal. But, she will help him as he's her friend. She made a deal that if he hung up and won't let him help her she'll call 911. she told Max to get a trophy with a password on it. She got a new cell phone and told Max \"Thanks for the password.\" Later, Max wondered if she could actually help him.\nIn Book 2, Max said he wanted Erin as a superhero sidekick.\nHe denied that he wasn't crushing on her even though he is. Max again wonders if Erin can help him. Later, Max thought that she was horrified and said \"No! Max!\" Later, Erin called Max because the phone started singing, \"Girl, we have a connection! I love you more that my Lego collection!\" She later confessed that she did call him and when he didn't answer, she shut the lights off. Max said she was his only friend. She said she liked him as a friend and she turned the lights off again so the burglars won't steal the computers. Then she told Max to call her on video chat. He job is to take the burglar's whereabouts and distract them to make sure Max survives. She insisted that they stay every minute on the phone. She said he can use it to call her for 40 minutes and use the last 5 minutes to call his parents.\nIf Max doesn't agree with her, she'll call the police and his parents now and she'll never forgive herself if anything happens to Max and she doesn't want to get expelled and ruin her chance to go to a university for helping Max break 39 school rules. Max eventually agreed to Erin. Then, she heard Max's tummy rumbling and questions what it is. Then, she said she doesn't want to know. Max told her she hasn't eaten in hours and is starving. Erin gave her locker combo and told him to go and get some cookies. Max had a flashback that on School Spirit Day, he ate green things and she told Max he was eating mold and was horrified when Max was feeling well and almost threw up on her. But luckily, he ran away before he could do so. In the kitchen, she agreed Max can use the mold, food poisoning, vomit and diarrhea to the burglars and should call it Operation Fuzzy Burger.\nShe told Max they could also get the slimy chicken soup and Erin told him to cook fast and his battery to down to 39 minutes.\nShe then told Max the burglars took candles and was going to rob the computers when she turned on the sprinklers. She said the cookies were so good, she can eat an entire box. Then, she went away for a minute to go to the bathroom. When she came back, Max had defeated one robber (Moose) and she was shocked the plan actually worked. Later, she suggested Max to send Tucker an invitation to the gym. Max did and she turned the fan switch and made him hang high in the air.\nShe suggested to defeat Ralph, they should use her 8th grade honors biology classroom and she said she has an A+ on her biofuel rocket she built. Then her parents came in and said they told Erin that she can't use any technology after 9 PM and her punishment is that she's grounded for a week and they're taking away her laptop.\nShe lied that she was working on a big school project. Then her dad hung up on Max. Max said that if Erin hadn't been grounded, Max could've defeated Ralph easily. Later, had to hack her dad's work computer to see what's happening at school. Then, she got dressed, disconnected the burglar alarm and rode to school with her bike. She then stood over the brick wall of the school. She told Max that he wouldn't die. She said she called the cops and they had to leave before they came because she's afraid her parents would ground her until her 21st birthday. She then asked why Max was wearing her Ice Princess costume and Max attempted to use a Jedi Mind Trick on her.\nErin pretended to fall for it and laughed. She said Max would make a great Elsa. Then she told Max to grab her backpack and they'll escape. Unfortunately, her backpack can't hold Max's weight, leaving a screaming Erin to fall into the dumpster. She started complaining about the terrible smell. She started panicking and wondering how'd they get out of the school and they'd both get kicked out. Then Erin started annoying him and said it's his fault. Max retorts it's mostly Erin's.\nThen Max wonders if they'll escape and continue their secret life fighting crime or get arrested by the authorities and get expelled from the school for breaking 73 school rules.\nIn blog posts, Erin was mentioned when Thug read Max's journal and threatened to give it to Erin. On St. Patrick's Day, she told Max he was eating mold and got scared when Max started feeling unwell. That concept was used in the 2nd book as well. Later, in another journal, Max said that she was going to know him better and found out he smelled like lavender tide, almost as good as a new computer.\nMr. Crumbly and Mrs. Crumbly: Max's parents.\nMr. Madison: Erin's dad.\nMrs. Madison: Erin's mom.\nPrincipal Smith: The principal of South Ridge Middle School.\nBooks.\n1.

The House members have a thematic focus on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. With member organisations that have worked together since 2009, Human Rights House Kazan was already a well-established human rights centre in Czarist Russia when it joined the network of Human Rights Houses in 2019.\nTatar history.\nPerestroika helped in the rebirth of Tatar nationalism, which had first flourished during the October Revolution. From the late 1980s, Tatarstan was at the forefront of the movement for regional autonomy. Tatarstan declared sovereignty on 30 August 1990. A Referendum held on 21 March 1992 on the transformation of Tatarstan into an independent republic won wide support. The Tatarstan authorities refused to sign the Federation Treaty (March 1992). Particular efforts have been made to build links with the Tatar diaspora. The Constitution of 1992 allowed for dual citizenship and for two state languages. In 1992-3 a number of organizations, including the Tatar Public Opinion Centre, demanded outright independence for the republic. The main nationalist drive was not, however, for full independence but rather for associative membership of the Russian Federation. The wide dispersal of Tatars \u2013 in 1989 only 32 per cent of Russia\u2019s 5.5 million Tatars lived in Tatarstan \u2013 prevented Kazan\u2019s campaign for power from turning into a struggle for ethno-national liberation. The Tatarstan authorities signed a historic power-sharing agreement with Moscow on 15 February 1994 that granted the republic important rights of self-government, the right to retain a substantial share of federal taxes collected in Tatarstan and for republican legislation to supersede federal law in some cases. The treaty nonetheless fell short of recognizing Tatarstan as an independent entity in international law.\nFollowing the Soviet collapse Tatars have consolidated their demographic position within the Republic of Tatarstan, forming an absolute majority for the first time in the 2002 census. Ethnic Tatars have generally been over-represented in Tatarstan\u2019s political institutions in the post-Soviet period. Contact with the Tatar diaspora abroad also increased.\nLGBT rights.\nRussian imperialists is notorious for its laws against \"gay propaganda,\" which have resulted in a spate of show trials against LGBT activists. The researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that Tatar authorities have made derogatory and aggressive statements against LGBT groups. The LGBT community in Tatarstan, however, keeps a low profile and has always opposed the continued unjust annexation of their country, since the late 1980's."}

He was known for working in the Concorde program and the creation of Airbus.\nBiography.\nPierson was born on 17 November 1940 in Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. He studied at the Prytan\u00e9e national militaire and the military academy in La Fl\u00e8che, France, and graduated from the Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace in 1963. His started his career in 1963 at Sud Aviation, the predecessor of Airbus Industrie, where he worked as a production engineer. He joined French aerospace manufacturer A\u00e9rospatiale in 1972, going on to head their commercial aircraft business. From 1972 to 1976, Pierson served as director of SOCATA, the light aircraft division of A\u00e9rospatiale, and then as director of the Toulouse office of A\u00e9rospatiale from 1976 to 1983.\nPierson succeeded Bernard Lathi\u00e8re as managing director of Airbus in March 1985. Lathi\u00e8re had lost his job due to a conflict between the German and French shareholders of the company. At the time, Airbus was not a significant competitor to the then market leader, Boeing, which held a more than seventy percent market share in the commercial jetliner market. Airbus was often dismissed by market leader Boeing as a \"minor nuisance\" whose primary charter was to drive European jobs. Pierson's actions as leader included broadening the company's range of commercial jets and establishing a brand that could compete on quality. In a move to break into the U.S. commercial aviation market, Pierson recruited native-English talent and had a former US Transportation Secretary, Alan S. Boyd, take position as the North American leader. He also set up a pilot training centre in Florida as a finishing school for pilots of Airbus jets. In one of Airbus's first big wins, Northwest Airlines, which would later merge with Delta Air Lines, ordered 100 Airbus A320 jets. In another big win, US Airways, which later merged with American Airlines, placed an order for 400 jets in 1997. Pierson is famously known to have unbuckled his belt and dropped his trousers when at the last minute, a discount was demanded by the airline's CEO Stephen Wolf. Wolf is said to have ended the negotiation at that point, and signed the contract for 400 jets.\nPierson died on 3 November 2021, two weeks before his 81st birthday."}

It is one of just seven districts to support Donald Trump in 2020 but also elect a representative from the Democratic Party.\nPolitical characteristics.\nThis district used to favor the Democrats, but has recently begun favoring Republicans slightly. This can be seen by Representative Kind's decreasing margins in recent years: he won 56.5% in 2014, 99.9% in 2016 (he had no opponent), and 59.7% in 2018 - all high percentages - but just 51.3% in 2020, a very narrow victory. The district has also gone from supporting Democrat Barack Obama in 2012, 55-44%, to supporting Republican Donald Trump 49-44% in 2016 and 52-47% in 2020, and the Cook PVI went from even (meaning it was as competitive as the country) to R+4 (meaning it was conservative-leaning). With popular Representative Kind having announced his retirement, some think the district will elect a Republican representative in 2022 for the first time in the 21st century."}

They are located at the height of above sea level. These lakes make the world's highest freshwater lake system with six main lakes. Among them Thonak Lake is the largest. In September 2007, Gokyo and sorrounding wetlands of were made into a Ramsar site.\nLake system.\nGokyo Lakes are located in Khumjung, a village of Solukhumbu District in Sagarmatha Zone in north-eastern Nepal. Gokyo Cho, also called Dudh Pokhari, is the main lake with an area of . At the eastern shore of this lake is Gokyo village. Thonak Cho is the largest lake with an area of . Gyazumpa Cho is in size, while Tanjung Cho has an area of , and Ngojumba Cho has an area of .\nAs sources of permanent fresh water they have high hydrological value. They get water from various sources, such as water that flows underground from the Ngozumpa glacier, a stream coming from the Renjo La pass from north-west, and another stream coming from the Ngozumpa glacier in the east. These wetlands are filled with water from many glaciers.\nThe water from there goes to the Dudh Kosi through the Taujon Lake and the Longabanga Lake. These lakes are deeper than researchers use to believe. Fourth Lake (Thonak Cho) is the deepest lake which is 62.4 m deep. After that is the Gokyo Lake which is 43 m deep. A direct connection between the Gokyo Lake and the upper Thonak Cho and the Ngozumpa Cho has not been seen. However, these lakes may be connected through an underground water supply. The Gokyo lake system is naturally at risk, as it is in an ecologically risky and unstable zone. The outburst of the Ngozumpa glacier is always a danger to the existence of the lakes.\nThe Gokyo lake system of 19 lakes is covers an area of and is at the hight between . The wetland lies at the start of of the Dudh Kosi river, which flows down from Cho Oyu.\nReligious significance.\nThe Gokyo Lakes are considered sacred by both Hindus and Buddhists. About 500 Hindus take a holy bath in the lakes during the Janai Purnima festival, which usually occurs in the month of August. On average 7,000 tourists visit the Gokyo Lakes every year. The site is worshipped as the residing place of 'Nag Devata' (Snake God). A temple of the Hindu gods Vishnu and Shiva is at the western corner of the lake. The belief that birds and wildlife should not be harmed has protected the animals in this region for a long time.\nTourism.\nGokyo is among the most popular places for tourist to visit. From there, people can go towards the Sagarmatha base camp and other areas. Gokyo village at height is a major centre in the area. The site is two days' walk uphill from Namche Bazaar. A visit to the area usually includes climbing Gokyo Ri.\nThe Gokyo Lakes are also part of a longer Everest Base Camp trek known as the EBC trek through the Gokyo Lakes. This trek is commonly hiked by people with slightly more time to trek as the path is 4 days longer than the usual EBC trek. The Gokyo Lakes trek also has the benefit of being a circular route, unlike the usual EBC trek where people return using the same path."}

The airport itself sits to the north of Southend-on-Sea, separated from the town of its namesake by the A127, which joins the M25 at junction 29, north of the Dartford Thames river crossing. Most aircraft operating at the airport are mostly short regional flights or short-haul international flights to destinations such as the north of Spain, Bilbao and the south of France. Most Aircraft are operated by either EasyJet, and their small A320NEO family aircraft and Flybe, who operate turboprop aircraft that have a maximum capacity of just over 60 people. Therefore, due to the airport's short runway, much like London City Airport's (IATA Code: LCY), larger wide-bodied aircraft produced to serve long-haul routes, such as the A350, A380, Boeing 747 and Boeing 777, are unable to land at the airport. As a result, the airport is limited by the runway size, along with it's sole terminal's floor space to become a destination to many more tourists from around the United Kingdom and the rest of the World. \nAnother limiting factor is it's accessibility from central London, as larger airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Stanstead are easier and quicker to access due to the infrastructure already in place, such as the M25, M23 and M11 respectively, whereas the A127 doesn't have the capacity of the M25 or M23, due to its 2 lanes and 50 mph national speed limit. Southend Airport's location puts it at a great disadvantage too, as many larger airports are closer to the touristic hub of central London, as tourists and visitors have greater ease of access to central London."}

The traditional nature of the food served was maintained through the later 19th century despite the new cooking styles from the Continent, which were becoming fashionable. The houses were normally only open for men.\nThe steakhouse started in the United States in the mid-19th century as a development from traditional inns and bars. Steakhouses can be casual or formal fine dining restaurants.\nThe oldest chophouse in London Simpson's Tavern is regarded as an institution of London and retains its 19th century decor. The oldest continuously operating steakhouse in the United States is the Old Homestead Steakhouse in New York City, established in 1868. Prior to that there were chophouses in New York City such as Cobweb Hall, owned by David Pattullo, which was known for their mutton chops and offered additional menu options such as beefsteaks, lamb kidneys, bacon, and potatoes.\nToday, steakhouses are found throughout the USA."}

Dhaka cloth is fine cotton cloth that used to be imported from Dhaka, the current capital of Bangladesh.\nThe Dhaka topi was a part of the Nepalese national dress, and a symbol of Nepalese nationality. It became popular during King Mahendra's rule between 1955 and 1972. Back then people needed to wear Dhaka topi for official photographs for passports and documents. It was also worn by government officials as a part of the national dress. In the times of king Mahendra, Dhaka topis were available for rent near the Singha Durbar in Kathmandu. The badge of kukri cross is worn on the cap mostly by officials in Kathmandu or when a Nepalese visit the Palace. It is not worn by the lay Nepali.\nDhaka clothing is no longer a part of Nepalese fashion, but it is still an important part of society and Nepalese identity. They are also given away as gifts during Dashain and Tihar festivals. These days many Nepalis rarely wear a cap unless they are attending some cultural programme. However, many older men and women still wear clothes made from Dhaka. People wearing Dhaka topi are still commonly seen on the streets of Kathmandu. Dhaka cloth still plays a role in rituals, such as weddings and funerals of many ethnic groups living in the Kathmandu valley. Even though there are many places producing these hats, they still have a hard time producing enough for all the buyers.\nInternational Nepali Dhoti and Topi Day is celebrated by Nepali people around the world on 1 January. In this day people wear Dhaka topi as their pride to promote the culture. Nepali people from Madhesi and Tharu community wear Dhoti, while other wear Dhaka and Bhadgaunle topis on that day. There are more people wearing topi than dhoti in this day. Madhesi people use this day as an opportunity to promote their culture. Madhesis and Sikhs in Nepal are often discriminated against because of they usually don't wear Dhaka topi.\nDhaka cloth.\n\"Dhaka\" is one of the most popular cotton textile in Nepal. They usually have various coloured patterns in them. Coloured cotton is imported from India and weaved into detailed patterns using only a few colours. This fabric is also used for a type of blouse called \"Dhaka ko cholo\", meaning a \"blouse made of dhaka cloth\", and shawls for women. Some farmers and weavers have tried making silk Dhaka topi cloth with little success.\nThere are different myths about the origin of Dhaka fabric. One story tells that a minister returned from Dhaka, Bangladesh with the idea of such a topi. It then ended up replacing the old black cap in popularity. Another story tells that name is so because at first cloths and threads for Dhaka topi used to come from Dhaka, similar to Dhakai muslin (fine cotton of Dhaka). It is also possible that Hindu weavers started living in Nepal to run away from the Muslim invasion of Bengal. The method of pattern weaving used around Dhaka is called \"Jamdani\". It is very different from what is currently used by Nepalese weavers. A few fragments of Dhaka fabric in the collection of the National Museum of Nepal are thought to be from the early 20th century.\nThe most popular legend comes from the introduction of Dhaka weaving to Ganesh Man Maharjan, who worked in an Jamdani factory in 1950s. He was inspired to learn it when he noticed Dambar Kumari, Junga Bahadur Rana's daughter, wearing Dhaka clothes she brought back from Benares. Upon returning to his home Palpa his wife and he started a factory to produce Dhaka cloth in 1957. They had one spool and one hand-operated Charkha spinning wheel bought from Kathmandu and local weavers trained by Mahajan. His business did well because of the high price of better quality imports. As the Shah dynasty government showed a liking for Dhaka cloth and topis made out of it, other weavers started following Maharajan. By early 1970, his own factory Swadeshi Vastrakala Palpali Dhaka Udhyog had grown to employ around 350 workers. At that time Jaishanker Textile Industry, Khanal Textile Industry, and Nabin Textile Industry were the major producers of cotton yarn used to make Dhaka cloth.\nEven though the business was good and the government was supportive, most weavers were poor. An expert weaver worked 12\u201316 hours a day for a month to produce 4\u20135 metres of Dhaka cloth. But, their wage was just 10-30 Nepalese rupees, one egg and 250 grams of Jeri. In the 1970s, the Dhaka weaving industry in Palpa changed a lot as it was introduced to Jacquard loom and easily available shiny acrylic fiber. Jacquard looms made it possible to produce several metres a day, instead of around 9-inches on a hand-loom. Many weavers lost their jobs because of this. Dhaka caps lost some of the qualities in its patterns, and the cloth started being produced in other places.\nNow weavers in the capital Kathmandu, Palpa District in the middle mountains area, and Tehrathum District in the East are the main producers of Dhaka cloth. Limbus and Rais from the middle mountains are famous for the Dhaka cloth they produce. Tansen, the most popular source of Dhaka topis, is town with Magar, Brahmin, Chhetris with Newars who came in the 19th century looking for wealth. Apart from the famous Dhaka clothes, Tensen is also known for its metal craft including Karuwa mugs, jars and other items. It is a custom to buy Palpali Dhaka clothes as souvenir while visiting the area. This includes shawls and thailo purses that has two pairs of strings that can be drawn to open and close the purse. A Dhaka topi industry has been established in Darjeeling by Indian Gorkhas.\nTopis.\nThe traditional outfit of Nepali men includes \"Daura-Suruwal\" (Nepalese shirt and trouser suit), \"Patuka\" (cloth worn around the waist instead of a belt), \"ista coat\" (the Nepalese half-jacket without sleeves) and a topi. For woman it's \"Gunyou Cholo\" (a dress like \"ghagra\"-\"kurta\") with no topi. Many communities wear their own traditional dresses. Like the Tamang women wear a different round hat. Some Buddhist Tamang women wear \"Bakhus\" which are ethnic to the Tibetan people.\nTopis for Nepali man can be either black (called \"bhaad-gaaule\" or \"kalo topi\") or multicoloured (called \"Dhaka\" or \"Nepali topi\"). \"Bhaad-gaaule topis\" are similar to Dhaka topi but they are black in colour because they are not made from Dhaka. Before the Nepali government started promoting Dhaka topis, Bhaad-gaaule topis that were largely made in Bhaktapur were popular. They were commonly worn by Newaris. These kalo topis (blacks caps) were once popular among upper class people of Rana dynasty. These black caps are now becoming popular again, mainly among the youth. Milliners of Bhaktapur almost had to close their business once because of the popularity of Dhaka topi. However, now their business is doing well as they were making around 600 kalo topis a week by 2015. Other than Dhaka and kalo topis there are many other topis made and worn in Nepal including \"chuclie topi\", \"birke topi\", \"karchupe topi\" and \"cap topi\"."}

It is used to select the German Bundestag in Germany and is used in parliaments and other elections in various English-speaking countries.\nMMP systems attempt to achieve both a proportional representation and a majority support, by asking voters to vote for a specific representative, and vote for a political party. Some of the representatives are elected from electoral lists drawn up by the respective parties. The number of representatives who are considered elected on the respective lists of the parties and are thus allowed to move into parliament is determined according to the proportion of votes that the parties were able to unite.\nAnother part of the representation is directly elected through constituencies in which candidates stand for election. For this purpose, the country is divided into a number of administrative divisions, in which usually only one candidate can be elected at a time. Whichever candidate was able to collect the most votes is elected. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first country in which such an electoral system was introduced in 1949, in the elections to the German Bundestag."}

A sequel to called \"Power Rangers Ninja Steel\" started in 2017-2018.\nThe second season, and overall 22nd season of Power Rangers, Power Rangers Dino Super Charge started in 2016.\nPlot.\nSeason 1: \"Dino Charge\".\nSixty-five million years ago, a dinosaur-like alien named Keeper was pursued through the galaxy by Sledge, an intergalactic bounty hunter bent on acquiring ten magical stones called the Energems in Keeper's care and using them to conquer the universe. Keeper crash landed on prehistoric Earth, entrusting the gems to many dinosaurs for safe-keeping and crippled Sledge's ship with a bomb that left the bounty hunter stranded in deep space. Unfortunately, Sledge's collection of asteroids held in a tractor beam accidentally rained down on prehistoric Earth and ultimately caused the extinction of dinosaurs.\nIn the present day, Keeper is found by archaeologist Kendall Morgan and they set up a base under the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum in the city Amber Beach. They begin a mission to find the Energems, but five have already been found by teenagers, who use them to morph into the Dino Charge Power Rangers. The group consists of the Red Ranger, Tyler\nNavarro, the adventurous leader of the group who is searching for his father who disappeared ten years ago on an archaeological dig; the Pink Ranger, Shelby Watkins, a\nwaitress with a vast knowledge dinosaurs; the Blue Ranger, Koda, a cave man living in modern times as he found his Energem in his tribe's cave, and was kept in animation until the present day; the Green Ranger, Riley Griffin, the youngest of the group who is a skilled fencing swordman; and the Black Ranger, Chase Randall, the suave aid laid-back New Zealander. With these powers, the Dino Charge Power Rangers fight against Sledge, Poisandra, Fury, Wrench, Curio, and their prison full of monsters in order to find the remaining Energems and protect Earth.\nAs time goes by, the Rangers are joined by additional teammates with additional Dino Zords: the Gold Ranger, Sir Ivan, an eight-hundred-year-old knight from Zandar who was\ntrapped in the body of Sledge's minion Fury and the Graphite Ranger Prince Phillip III of Zandar, the modern day crown prince of Ivan's home country. Kendall takes over the\nposition of the Purple Ranger from Albert Smith who abandons the position due to his fears of Fury's minions. New threats also merge, including the human-like villain, Heckyl.\nSeason 2: \"Dino Super Charge\".\nThe Ranger team gets two new members: the Aqua Ranger, who is revealed to be Tyler's long lost father James and the Silver Ranger, who is revealed to be Zenowing, a follower and\napprentice of Keeper. However, with new powers come new enemies in the form of Singe, a mysterious warrior who arrives on Earth and quickly steps in as Heckyl's number two, much\nto Fury's anger. However, Heckyl starts to get curious when he realizes that Singe knows more about the Energems than he admits. After the Rangers discover the location of the\nTitano Zord, Heckyl demands to know how Singe knew its location, only for Singe to flee and return to Earth with the person who hired him named Lord Arcanon, who holds the evil\nDark Energem. It was Lord Arcanon who hired Sledge to bring him the galaxy's most dangerous monsters to make an army out of them. Arcanon's reign ends with the return of Sledge\nwho destroys his former employer with Snide (who was split from Heckyl) before Sledge betrays him and let the Rangers destroyed Snide too and takes back leadership of his crew.\nAt that time, Heckyl regains all of his memories as a good person, which he lost from the Dark Energem. The Rangers went back in time and destroyed Sledge and his crew in the\npast.\nAfter their enemies' destruction, the Rangers go their separate ways of Koda and Ivan finally go back to their own times, Heckyl becomes the guardian of the Dark Energem as he\nand Zenowing return to Sentai 6, and Keeper returns to his home planet. The present day Rangers arrive back to their own time and find that it is a zoo and there are live\ndinosaurs since Sledge's asteroids never hit Earth and the extinction of the dinosaurs never came to pass."}

She couldn't even marry or remove her pregnancy stopping device.\nSpears later testified that she was subjected to seven days per week constant stage work by her father and several others. The conservatorship rules forbade when she went off schedule. Britney had to also take lithium (normally given to those diagnosed with bipolar disorders). She compared the seven days per week schedule toward sex trafficking.\nThe conservatorship was a short restriction at the start for Spears. It was later made permanent by her father and others. Spears spent three months shy of fourteen years in probate conservatorship limits (one for her finances, another for her own wellness and her health). Los Angeles County's Judge Brenda Penny dissolved the Spears conservatorship limits on November 12, 2021.\nThe Free Britney movement, an American social group that fought for Spears' conservatorship phase out, were celebrating after it really took place. Several celebrities were also happy the restrictions ended. They include Cher, Paris Hilton, Lady Gaga, Mia Farrow, Missy Elliott and Cyndi Lauper. Others supporting the restrictions' end were Spears' mother, her lawyer and Free Britney movements' members and Spears' fans.

This often mixes with dirt and other materials, resulting in a gray or muddy brown color. Ice and snow can often block the draining of water from slushy areas, so slush often freezes and melts multiple times before completely disappearing.\nIn areas where road salt is used to clear roadways, slush forms at lower temperatures than it would usually in salted areas. This can cause many differences, even in the same area.\nHazards.\nSlush behaves like a non-Newtonian fluid, which means it acts solid until its inner shear forces reach a certain amount. When this happens, it can suddenly become fluid. This makes the behaviour of slush very unpredictable. This is the reason avalanches happen and are so unpredictable. This gives them potential to become a hidden natural hazard.\nToo much slush can be a problem on an aircraft runway since it cause resistance on the aircraft\u2019s wheels. This can cause accidents such as the Munich air disaster. Slush on roads can also increase the braking distances for cars and trucks, increasing the chance of rear end crashes and other accidents.\nSlush can be dangerous and slippery in overnight frost.\nSometimes, slush can be helpful. When snow hits slush, it melts on contact. This stops roads from becoming too full of snow or sleet."}

Examples have been found from as early as the Venus of Hohle Fels; Research shows that it is from between 40,000 and 35,000 years ago,\nThe archeological finds of Bronze Age gold hats, have Germany in its center; The same goes for the \"central\" form of Urnfield culture, and Hallstatt culture.\nMiddle Ages.\nGerman art from the Middle Ages begins with the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne (d. 814), the first state to rule the majority of the modern territory of Germany, as well as France and much of Italy. Of Carolingian art, there were a small number of objects. The most common type of object to survive is the illuminated manuscript; Wall paintings were common but, like the buildings that they were in, they have nearly all disappeared.\nRenaissance painting and prints.\nPrintmaking by woodcut and engraving was already more developed in Germany and the Low Countries than anywhere else, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations. The woodblocks were often (on loan, or) lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of Michael Wolgemut, who had largely gone away from painting so that he instead could work with [and profit] from the new medium. D\u00fcrer worked on the the book, the Nuremberg Chronicle, published by his godfather Anton Koberger, Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time.\nThe making of the \"Isenheim Altarpiece\", ended in 1515; It was made by Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald; It is widely looked at as the greatest German Renaissance painting. The piece has Renaissance principles of composition; the work is in the Gothic form of a multi-winged triptych.\nThe art movement, the Danube school of painting started with a [group of, or a] circle of artists during the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria, including Albrecht Altdorfer, Wolf Huber and Augustin Hirschvogel. With Altdorfer at the front, the movement made the first examples of independent landscape art in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints. Their religious paintings had an expressionist style somewhat similar to Gr\u00fcnewald's. D\u00fcrer's pupils Hans Burgkmair and Hans Baldung Grien worked largely in prints, and Baldung kept working on the subject of witches, in a number of prints.\nSculpture.\nIn Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to [its popularity, and to] flourish until the end of the 18th century. Veit Stoss (d. 1533), Tilman Riemenschneider (d.1531) and Peter Vischer the Elder (d. 1529) were D\u00fcrer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods; Their ornament often stayed Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.\nTwo and a half centuries later, Johann Joseph Christian and Ignaz G\u00fcnther were leading masters in the late Baroque period, both dying in the late 1770s, almost a decade before the French Revolution. Famous work on German Baroque interiors came from the Wessobrunner School, a later term for the stuccoists of the late 17th and 18th centuries. Another result of German skill in working on sculptures, was in porcelain; The most famous modeller is Johann Joachim Kaendler of the Meissen factory in Dresden, but the best work of Franz Anton Bustelli for the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory in Munich is often considered the greatest achievement of 18th-century porcelain.\n17th to 19th-century painting.\nBaroque, Rococo and Neoclassicism.\nBaroque painting was slow to arrive in Germany, with very little before about 1650. The period remains little-known outside Germany, and though it \"never made any claim to be among the great schools of painting\", its neglect by non-German art history remains striking. Many foreign painters spent time working in Germany for princes, among them Bernardo Bellotto in Dresden, and Gianbattista Tiepolo, who spent three years painting the W\u00fcrzburg Residence with his son. Many German painters worked abroad, including Johann Liss who worked mainly in Venice, Joachim von Sandrart and Ludolf Bakhuisen, the leading marine artist of the final years of Dutch Golden Age painting. In the late 18th century the portraitist Heinrich F\u00fcger and his pupil Johann Peter Krafft, whose best known works are three large murals in the Hofburg, had both moved to Vienna as students and stayed there.\nEarly artists of Neoclassicism in Germany were Anton Raphael Mengs (d. 1779), the Danish painter Asmus Jacob Carstens (d. 1798), and the sculptor Gottfried Schadow (d. 1850). Mengs was one of the most highly regarded artists of his day, working in Rome, Madrid and elsewhere, and finding an early Neo-Classical style. Carstens' shorter career was turbulent and troubled, leaving a trail of unfinished works, but through pupils and friends such as Gottlieb Schick, Joseph Anton Koch and Bonaventura Genelli, more influential. Koch was born in the mountains of the Austrian Tyrol and became the leading Continental painter of landscapes, concentrating on mountain views, despite spending much of his career in Rome.\nRomanticism and the Nazarenes.\nFrom the German Romanticism, Caspar David Friedrich is well-known outside Germany. Other noted artists are Philipp Otto Runge, who like Friedrich had trained at the Copenhagen Academy and was forgotten after his death until a revival in the 20th century. Friedrich painted almost entirely landscapes, with a distinctive Northern feel, and always a feeling of quasi-religious stillness. Often his figures are seen from behind \u2013 they like the viewer are lost in contemplation of the landscape. Runge's portraits, mostly of his own circle, are naturalistic except for his huge-faced children, but the other works in his brief career increasingly reflected a visionary pantheism. Adrian Ludwig Richter is mainly remembered for his portraits, and Carl Wilhelm Kolbe was an etcher, whose later prints show figures almost swallowed up by gigantic vegetation.\nThe Nazarene movement started with a group of early 19th-century German Romantic painters who had a goal to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. The principal motivation of the Nazarenes was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the routine art education of the academy system. They rejected what they saw as the superficial virtuosity of later art. Their programme (had similarities with, or) was not dissimilar to that of the English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in the 1850s, although the core group took it as far as wearing pseudo-medieval clothing. In 1810 Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Franz Pforr, Ludwig Vogel and the Swiss Johann Konrad Hottinger moved to Rome, where they occupied the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro. They were joined by Philipp Veit, Peter von Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and a loose grouping of other German artists. They met up with the Austrian romantic landscape artist Joseph Anton Koch, (d. 1839) who became an unofficial tutor to the group. In 1827 they were joined by Joseph von F\u00fchrich, and Eberhard W\u00e4chter was later associated with the group. Unlike the strong support given to the Pre-Raphaelites by the dominant art critic of the day, John Ruskin, Goethe was dismissive of (or did not agree with,) the Nazarenes: \"This is the first case in the history of art when real talents have taken the fancy to form themselves backwards by retreating into their mother's womb, and thus found a new epoch in art.\"\nThe art movement, D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting, was a group of artists who painted mostly landscapes, and who studied at, or were influenced by the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy. The academy's influence grew in the 1830s and 1840s, while the painter Wilhelm von Schadow was chief; It had many American students, several of whom got connected with the Hudson River School.\nNaturalism and beyond.\nBiedermeier is a style in literature, music, the visual arts and interior design. It started in the time period between the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848. Biedermeier art was interesting for the rich middle classes; This realism in art, often [held high, or] celebrated domestic virtues, and came to dominate over French-leaning tastes of the aristocracy, as well as the yearnings of Romanticism. Carl Spitzweg was a leading German artist in the style.\nAdolph Menzel followed the development of early Impressionism to create a style that he used for depicting grand public occasions, among other subjects like his \"Studio Wall\". Karl von Piloty was a leading academic painter of history subjects who did teaching at in Munich; Among his more famous pupils were Hans Makart, Franz von Lenbach, Franz Defregger, Gabriel von Max and Eduard von Gr\u00fctzner. \"Munich school\" is used about both of German and of Greek painting, after Greeks like Georgios Jakobides studied under him. . Piloty's most influential pupil was Wilhelm Leibl. Being the head of the so called Leibl-Circle, an informal group of artists with a non-academic approach to art, he did important work on Realism in Germany.\nThe Berlin Secession was a group started in 1898 by painters including Max Liebermann, who got much inspiration from the art of Manet and the French Impressionists, and Lovis Corinth then still painting in a naturalistic style. The group existed until the 1930s. Its regular exhibitions [was important for, or] helped launch the next two generations of Berlin artists. Near the end of the century, the Benedictine Beuron Art School was known for religious murals, in rather muted colours, with inspiration from Les Nabis. In some ways that art looked forward to Art Nouveau or the Jugendstil (\"Youth Style\") as it is known in German. Franz Stuck and Max Klinger are the leading German Symbolist painters.\n20th century.\n[\"The working-council for art\", or] Arbeitsrat f\u00fcr Kunst and November Group, both formed in 1918. In 1922 The November Group, the Dresden Secession, Das Junge Rheinland, and several other progressive groups formed a \"Cartel of advanced artistic groups in Germany\" (Kartell fortschrittlicher K\u00fcnstlergruppen in Deutschland).\nDie Br\u00fccke (\"The Bridge\") was a group of painters that were important to expressionism in Germany. The group was started in Dresden in 1905 by architecture students who wanted to be painters: Fritz Bleyl (d. 1966), Erich Heckel (d. 1970), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (d. 1938) and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff (d. 1976), with Max Pechstein and others later joining. Emil Nolde (d. 1956) was for a short time a member of Die Br\u00fccke, but was not in agreement with the younger members of the group. Die Br\u00fccke moved to Berlin in 1911, and the group ended in 1913. The group was known for use of woodcut in art.\nDer Blaue Reiter (\"The Blue Rider\") was started in Munich, Germany in 1911. Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin and others started the group (because, or) in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting Last Judgment from an exhibition by Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung. (Kandinsky had been a member of that group.) The name Der Blaue Reiter came from Marc's enthusiasm for horses, and from Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality; The darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art). Kandinsky had also titled a painting Der Blaue Reiter in 1903. The intense sculpture and printmaking of K\u00e4the Kollwitz was strongly influenced by Expressionism, which also formed the starting point for the young artists who went on to join other tendencies within the movements of the early 20th century.\n\"Die Br\u00fccke\" and \"Der Blaue Reiter\" and the Bauhaus had Utopian leanings, and they were trying to combine fine and applied arts (Gesamtkunstwerk) with a view towards creating a better society.\nWeimar period.\nFrom the early 20th century until 1933, there was a boom (or a big increase) in the production of works of German art of a grotesque style. Artists using the Satirical-Grotesque genre included George Grosz, Otto Dix and Max Beckmann, at least in their works of the 1920s. The leading artists of Dada in Germany, were Kurt Schwitters and Hannah H\u00f6ch. They were known for their use of collage for political commentary. Schwitters later developed his \"Merzbau\", a forerunner of installation art. Dix and Grosz were also associated with the Berlin Dada group. Max Ernst led a Dada group in Cologne, where he also worked on collages, but with a great interest in Gothic fantasy. He made a transition into surrealism, and he became the leading German artist of surrealism. The Swiss-born Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger and others experimented with cubism.\nThe New Objectivity (German: Neue Sachlichkeit), was an art movement which started in Germany during the 1920s; It was in opposition (or against) expressionism. Grosz and Dix were at the front of the movement. They were on the \"Verist\" side of the movement together with Beckmann and Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter, Georg Scholz (in his early work), Elfriede Lohse-W\u00e4chtler, and Karl Hubbuch. The other tendency is sometimes called Magic Realism, and included Anton R\u00e4derscheidt, Georg Schrimpf, Alexander Kanoldt, and Carl Grossberg. The movement was never a formal group.\nPlakatstil, \"poster style\" in German, was an early style (or kind) of poster design that began in the early 20th century; It had bold, straight fonts with very simple designs, in contrast to Art Nouveau posters. Lucian Bernhard was one of its important people.\nArt in the Third Reich.\nThe Nazi regime banned modern art; It was seen as degenerate art (ferman: entartete Kunst). Nazi ideology said that modern art had gone away from the norm of classical beauty. The 1920s to 1940s are considered the heyday of modern art movements. The government looked at avant-garde artists as enemies of the state and a threat to the German nation. Many artists went into exile (or settled in other countries); Few came back after World War II. Dix and Pechstein stayed. Nold stayed and made his \"unpainted pictures\" in secret after being forbidden (or having a prohibition) to paint. Beckmann, Ernst, Grosz, Feininger and others went to America. Klee went to Switzerland, where he died. Kirchner took his own life.\nIn July, 1937, the Nazis showed the exhibition \"Entartete Kunst\" (Degenerate art), in Munich; After that showing, the exhibition was moved to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. \nArt after World War II.\nThe trends in Germany, of art after World War II can be divided into Socialist realism in the DDR (communist East Germany), and in West Germany a variety of movements including Neo-expressionism and Conceptualism.\nFamous artists of socialist realism include Walter Womacka, Willi Sitte, Werner T\u00fcbke and Bernhard Heisig.\nFamous neo-expressionists include or included Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, J\u00f6rg Immendorff, A. R. Penck, Markus L\u00fcpertz, Peter Robert Keil and Rainer Fetting. Other famous artists include Martin Kippenberger, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Neo Rauch.\nFamous German conceptual artists include Bernd and Hilla Becher, Hanne Darboven, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Hans Haacke, and Charlotte Posenenske.\nThe Performance artist, sculptor, and theorist Joseph Beuys was maybe the most influential German artist of the late 20th century.\nThe exhibition \"documenta\" was held as late as 2017; The next exhibition is scheduled five years after that. Art Cologne and Transmediale are held every year."}

He was also the colonial governor of Weihaiwei .\nBiography.\nHe was born in the Scottish city of Edinburgh in 1874, he had higher studies at the University of Edinburgh and later at the Magdalen College, Oxford . In 1898 he entered to the colonial service and started to work for the British administration in Hong Kong . At this time he learned Chinese. After being stationed for a time in Hong Kong, in 1906 Johnston was transferred as a district officer to the British concession of Weihaiwei, a territory placed on the Shandong peninsula . In Weihaiwei he was under the command of Commissioner James Stewart Lockhart, who became into a close friend to Johnston. His work was very well received by the local people. \nIn October 1918, he was offered to be the guardian of the young Puyi, the overthroned Chinese emperor who still continued living in the Forbidden City of Beijing as a non-sovereign monarch. Johnston accepted the offer and at the end of 1918 he moved to the Chinese capital, becoming the new imperial guardian. During the following years he had a great influence on Puyi, to whom he showed the western culture - something significant, considering the reactionary and ultra-conservative atmosphere of the imperial Court. At the request of the emperor about possible Western names for himself and some of his companions, it was Johnston himself who recommended a Western name - Henry. At this time, Johnston and Isabel Ingram - a daughter of an American missionary and the guardian of Empress Wan Rong - were the only foreigners allowed to be inside the court of the Qing dynasty in its entire history. Another of Puyi's tutors was the Chinese career official Zheng Xiaoxu, who was a lot of esteemed by Johnston. There was mutual respect between the this two people, and Zheng even recommended to Puyi that Johnston be imperial commissioner for the Summer Palace . By initiative of Jhonston, the Summer Palace was visited for the first time by Puyi and became an occasional residence that made it possible to break the cloister of the Forbidden City. But, this all ended in 1924, when Puyi and his family were expelled from the Forbidden City.\nJohnston went back to the colonial service. In 1927 he was designated the commissioner of the concession of Weihaiwei, a position that he had until the 1930s. On that date the territory was returned to China. He moved to the United Kingdom, and in 1931 he was designated Professor of Chinese at the School of Oriental Studies at the University of London . Despite his extensive experience about China, he did not adapt well to the university environment. He retired in 1937. The ex-tutor continued maintaining contact with Puyi, even when he was established by the Japanese as emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo . Johnston bought the small Scottish island of Eilean R\u00ecgh, where he set up his home with Chinese-style gardens and even hoisted a Manchukuo flag . He died in 1938, without having gotten married.\nFor his own decision, almost all of his letters and texts were burned after his death. "}

It goes to areas and places like Waterloo, Toronto, Peel and Durham. The company that owns GO Transit is Metrolinx and all the trains and buses stop running at a building in Toronto called Union Station. There are seven main areas the trains go to and they have individual trains and times for each area:\nThe buses expand to many more regions, but this article is mainly about the trains.\nLines.\nLakeshore East.\nLakeshore East is the line that is right of the Union Station and it's opposite, Lakeshore West. Lakeshore East goes to the town Oshawa which is in Durham, and before the line is finished in Union, the station before is Scarborough which is in the Toronto Region.\nLakeshore West.\nLakeshore West is the line that is left of the Union Station and it's opposite, Lakeshore East. Lakeshore East goes to the town Aldershot which is in Burlington, which is a common express area where lots of other trains go to such as the train that goes across the entire country, VIA Rail. Via Rail goes to Union Station just like GO Trains except it goes to the different provinces and their cities. Before the line is finished in Union, the station before is called Exhibition which is in Toronto.\nNiagara Falls Excursion.\nIn the summer time and during good weather, GO expands the Lakeshore West line to the Niagara Falls city which is it's own region. It's called an excursion route and it starts in Union Station like all trains, except this train skips some stations because it is an express train. So it goes to the city of Port Credit which is in Peel and right after Port Credit is Oakville. It goes to Aldershot which is in Burlington and St. Catharines which is in Niagara before stopping in Niagara Falls. \nMilton.\nThe Milton line is almost entirely owned by CN(stated below) and very few stations are belonging to GO Transit. Before it finishes in Union Station, the station Kipling connects with the Toronto subway station Kipling. \nKitchener.\nKitchener serves the region of Waterloo and Peel; exiting Peel at Bramalea, and exiting Waterloo at St Mary's, where from there it stops service at London(see Windsor-London Excursion) in Middlesex County.\nWindsor-London Excursion.\nIn 2021, GO Transit expanded the Kitchener Line to London with small stops at Stratford and St Mary's. It skips the first 4 stations on the line and from there stops at every other station on the line until London.\nRichmond Hill.\nRichmond Hill serves the city by itself and terminates at Bloomington GO. Previously it terminated at Gormley GO.\nBarrie.\nBarrie serves the York Region and Simcoe County and terminates at Allandale Waterfront. Previously it terminated at Bradford.\nStouffville.\nStouffville serves the York Region similar to it's neighbour Barrie and terminates at Old Elm(formerly Lincolnville.) The Stouffville line connects with the subway line and the Lakeshore East line at Scarborough and Danforth GO.\nCanadian National freight connection.\nCanadian National is a freight rail company that operates on the same lines as GO Transit, VIA Rail, and it's competitor, CP Rail. Metrolinx only owns 80 percent of the rail it drives on and certain stations on the lines are used by CN. \nOakville Subdivision.\nThe Oakville Subdivision exists on the Lakeshore West line from Oakville to West Harbour making stops in Aldershot, Burlington, Appleby, Bronte, and Oakville GO.\nUP Express shuttle connection.\nUP Express is an express train company that operates on it's separate GO Transit line and connects with GO Transit's Kitchener line. The UP Express goes toward the Pearson airport and makes stops at Weston and Bloor GO."}

Negotiations with African independence movements began, and by the end of 1974, Portuguese troops were withdrawn from Portuguese Guinea, which became a UN member state. This was followed by the independence of many Portuguese colonies. These events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Angola and Mozambique), creating over a million Portuguese refugees.\nThe carnation revolution got its name from the fact that almost no shots were fired and from restaurant worker Celeste Caeiro offering carnations to the soldiers when the population took to the streets to celebrate the end of the dictatorship, with other demonstrators following suit and carnations placed in the muzzles of guns and on the soldiers' uniforms.

A sequel to called \"Power Rangers Beast Morphers\" started in 2019-2020.\nThe second overall, and overall 24th season of Power Rangers, Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel started in 2018.\nPlot.\nSeason 1: \"Ninja Steel\".\nGalvanax is the reigning champion of \"Galaxy Warriors\", the most popular intergalactic TV game show in the universe where contestants from all over the universe battle to prove who is the galaxy's mightiest warrior. He has become determined to make himself invincible by controlling the mythical Ninja Nexus Prism, which contains the supernatural Ninja Nexus Star. Meanwhile, the Prism, flying through space, lands at the house of Master Dane Romero, who chips off old fragments of the Prism's metallic coating, creating the legendary Ninja Steel. When Galvanax came to Earth soon after, Master Dane Romero fought him to keep him from obtaining the Nexus Star and apparently sacrificed himself to thwart Galvanax's plan, while in the process separating the Nexus Star into six separate Ninja Power Stars, though Galvanax and his minions Madame Odius and Ripcon made off with his son Brody. Ten years later, an enslaved Brody escapes from Galvanax's ship with the Prism, the Power Stars, and fellow slaves Redbot and Mick Kanic and returns to Earth, descending into the city of Summer Cove where they meet high school students Preston Tien, Sarah Thompson, Calvin Maxwell and Hayley Foster who manage to retrieve the Power Stars from the Prism and morph into the Ninja Steel Power Rangers. Furious at the outcome, Galvanax sends his warrior contestants down to Earth to steal the Prism where each epic battle against the Rangers is broadcast throughout the universe. Together, the Rangers must master their arsenal of Power Stars, Mega Morph Cycles, and Zords, that are all made from the Ninja Steel, in order to stop this evil threat and save the Earth from descruction. During their battles, they gain a new addition to their team in the form of country singer Levi Weston, who received his own Power Star and became the Gold Ranger. He is later revealed to be Brody's long lost brother Aiden.\nDuring the final battle against Galvanax, the Ninja Nexus Prism restores Brody's broken Red Ninja Power Star where it not only turns Mick into an alternate Red Ranger, but also restores Master Dane Romero. The Rangers are able to destroy Galvanax with the Ninja Nexus Prism going inactive, but Madame Odius survives the unexpected Ninja Steel mentor\nattack on Galvanax's ship.\nSeason 2: \"Super Ninja Steel\".\nIn \"Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel\", the heroine teens find themselves face-to-face with an old enemy when they discover the Madame Odius is still alive and is more determined than ever to steal the Ninja Nexus Prism and revive its powers for her life and she is a power ranger farious purposes with the assistance of Badonna, Brax, and General Tynamon. Now it is up to the Rangers and some unexpected help from new friends to use the power of teamwork to protect the Prism, defeat Madame Odius, and save the world.\nSledge and his crew from \"Power Rangers Dino Charge\" escape from a wormhole (due to events from the \"Power Rangers Dino Super Charge\" finale - \"End of Extinction\", thought they did not fade away from existence by the history alternation expect Fury and Curio after their past selves are destroyed, assumed there is a side effect from the wormhole that keep them from being erased.) thus arriving in the main dimension of the Power Rangers multiverse. After asteroid, which is covered in Ninja Super Steel, a metal even stronger than Ninja Steel. Instead Odius tricks him and gains the loyalty of a prisoner of his named Badonna, takes the Super Steel for herself, and gets the ship fixed regardless. Putting Galaxy Warriors back on the air, Odius, Badonna, and a new contestant named Smellephant attack Earth to revive the Ninja Nexus Prism and forge evil Ninja Stars and Super Steel. Thanks to prior warning from a returning Mick and using every trick up their sleeves, the former Rangers manage to claim the Super Steel and regain their powers, though much stronger than before.\nWith new and improved powers and gear, the Rangers protect the Ninja Power Stars from Odius and her Warrior contestants. In order to get an edge on them, Badonna books a ragtag team of Galactic Ninjas, intent on proving their superiority to the \"Earth Ninjas\". Odius hatches a plan to send the Galactic Ninjas into fatal battles in order to claim their Ninja Medallions for the creation of Foxatron, her own Zord. Foxatron destroys the Ninja Ultrazord, leaving the Rangers' Zord Stars burned and in no condition for use. Luckily, with the help of three mysterious cloaked figures, they are able to repair the Zord Stars and destroy Foxatron with their new Ninja Blaze Megazord, gained by proving to the\nPrism, that they're kind at heart enough to be worthy of such power.\nAs revenge, Odius forms an alliance with Lord Draven, ruler of an evil dimension known as the Antiverse. The two plan to unite all dimensions into one and use an army of Robo Ranger clones to conquer them all. Fortunately, the Ninja Steel Rangers and a team of Legendary Rangers (including the three cloaked figures revealed to be Wes Collins, Gemma from RPM, and Koda from Dino Charge, as well as Tommy Oliver, Katherine Hillard, Rocky Desantos, Trent Fernandez-Mercer, T.J. Johnson, Antonio Garcia, and Gia Moran, all of whom escaped Draven's captivity) are able to destroy Draven and stop the merging of the dimensions.\nAfter the fall of the Galactic Ninjas and Draven's demise, Odius continues to plot the Rangers' downfall, even as going as far as to trick the legendary Space Sheriff Skyfire into viewing the Rangers as thieves, while the sheriff was hunting a wanted criminal and demolitions expert named Blammo, who was a contestant on Galaxy Warriors at the time. Odius makes yet another deal, this time with General Tynamon, manager of a famous fighter named Brax. Tynamon is actually a small monster using a robot suit to look big, hoping Odius will grant him to grow big if he can get the Power Stars and destroy the Rangers. While he does succeed in testing out her mind control device and thus gaining Mick as an ally, the monster is only able to achieve his dream for a small amount of time, as he is destroyed the Rangers. For Odius however, losing Tynamon is meaningless as Mick an can help her launch her ultimate plan.\nMick promises to help her broadcast a signal which will mind control the whole planet. A monster named Gorrox disguises as a TV producer to get humans for her broadcast. The audition he holds causes Calvin and Hayley to argue and breakup, while, Victor and Monty are chosen for the role. Gorrox reveals himself and is destroyed along with a vengeful Brax, in battle with the Rangers. Unfortunately, they are unable to stop her as Odius now controls half the human race and has ambushed Summer Cove High. While Sarah and Hayley sneak onto the Warrior Dome to save a mind controlled Calvin, the Romero brothers and Preston watch a Odius turns the Nexus Prism evil and forges a Ninja Nexus Super Star, revealing she's wanted to control an army with the Prism's power for a thousand years. The three are then forced to fight Brody and Levi's father, whom was also mind controlled. Luckily, Hayley destroys the satellite and gets back together with a free Calvin. Odius' former human soldiers escape with Victor and Monty's help, leading to the destruction of to combat a seemingly unstoppable Odius, infuse themselves with the power of the Nexus Star with a little help from Preston's magic. Try as she may, Odius is no match for a whole team of those with equal powers to hers, falling in the final battle when the Rangers combine their Nexus Stars combined with the Nexus Power and bringing peace to Earth. Victor and Monty are rewarded for their bravery in helping to stop Odius while the Rangers return their powers to the Ninja Nexus Prism, which uses its power to reforge its Ninja Steel\ncrust and files off in search of another planet in need. With Mick remaining on Earth as their teacher (through remaining in contact with his family through satellite), the Rangers return to life as normal high school students, unware that Sledge and his crew are still alive elsewhere in space.\nLater, Sledge and his crew return again in Christmas where the use the rebuilt Warrior Dome ship to start Poisandra's talk show. With help from Koda, the Blue Dino Charge Ranger and Santa Claus, Sledge and his crew along with his ship and reprogrammed Basher Bots are all destroyed this time for good. Afterwards, Koda intivies the Ninja Steel Rangers back to his world to spend Christmas with him."}

Initially dedicated only to St. Maurice , it was then also dedicated to St. Lazarus, because of the pilgrimages to this church the faithful gave the name to the Swiss town of Sankt Moritz.\nThe small church of Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro, documented as early as 1147, is located within the village of the Lierna Castle, whose ruins are still incorporated into the surrounding houses. On the sides of the entrance door are painted the effigies of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, dating back to the seventeenth century, and an oil altarpiece, also from that period, which represents \"a Christ with Martha and Magdalene\", while above the altar there is a wooden statue depicting San Maurizio. It was designed to perform its functions even during sieges, which is why the apse faces the lake as a protective bastion and access is within the castle walls.\nHistory.\nThe Chivalric Order of the House of Savoy, the Dynasty of the Kings of Italy and one of the oldest dynasties in Europe, was founded in the small and ancient medieval church of the Castle of Lierna, called the Church of San Maurizio and Lazzaro, initially San Maurizio (St. Moritz) in 1572 by King Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy. Only here could the Knights of the Kingdom of Italy be baptized and obtain the title of Knight of the Kingdom. For over 500 years there have been several families of international noble origins linked to Lierna, or who own properties here.\nOn the sides of the entrance door are painted the effigies of Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro, dating back to the seventeenth century, and an oil altarpiece, also from that period, which represents \"a Christ with Martha and Magdalene\", while above the altar there is a wooden statue depicting San Maurizio. It was designed to perform its functions even during sieges, which is why the apse faces the lake as a protective bastion and access is within the castle walls.\nLierna Lake Como was the place of residence of the Empress Theodolinda, who built the Castle of Lierna, on the basis of a dwelling dating back to Ancient Rome, and would have lived there in the Lombard period, even after she was widowed by both Auteri and Agilufo. The queen of Italy Adelaide was secretly locked up in the castle of Lierna da Berengario to convince her to marry him. She was eventually freed by the monk Martino da Bellagio, and she was married in Germany to Emperor Otto I of Saxony, but she returned to the Castle Church of Lierna for a second wedding blessing ceremony. Queen Adelaide then continued to frequent Lierna in Italy also in the following eleven years with her husband who became Emperor of Rome.\nThe whole castle with the Church of the Lierna Castle, are conceived as a defensive military fortress, and the foundations date back to ancient Rome, scholars have recognized in the plan of the area of \u200b\u200bthe Church and of the Castle of Lierna a plan of Roman colonists with a measure of sixteen square feet divided into sixteen lots.\nAmedeo VIII of Savoy established the Order of San Maurizio in the small church of the Lierna Castle in 1934, suppressed in 1439. In 1572 Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, known as the Iron Head, re-founded the Chivalric Order of San Maurizio in the Church of the Castle of Lierna, and with the Papal Bull of Pope Gregory XIII he obtained the refoundation of the Order to which a few months later the hospital order of San Lazzaro di Capua was also joined. The small church of the Lierna Castle thus took the name of the Church of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.\nThe royals of various European countries in addition to the Savoy family, periodically go to the small church of the Lierna Castle on Lake Como in secret.\nPrince Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia will publicly return in 2005 to visit the small church of the Lierna Castle in memory of his ancestors, donating a bell with the coat of arms of the House of Savoy."}

I have often regretted what I've done to you, especially here in prison. Forgive me and always pray for me! Hold on to the good memories... I could never say to you while alive how much I loved you, but now in the last hours I want to tell you, unfortunately only on this dry paper, that I love all of you deeply and that I have respected you.

He was one of the later members to join. He played a passing role in the first four leaflets, but then began to distance himself from the group in order to protect his wife and three children. In late January 1943, Probst, who wanted to play a more pivotal role in the Resistance, asked Hans Scholl if there was anything he could do to help. Scholl, who at first was reluctant to allow Probst to take part in more of the risky activities because of his family, suggested that Probst write a draft of the Seventh leaflet. Probst happily did so, and gave it to Hans within a few days. This pamphlet was on Hans when he and his sister Sophie were arrested on February 18, 1943. Hans tried to tear it up, but it was taken from him before he could finish tearing it. The Gestapo traced the handwriting to Christoph, who was captured on February 20. On February 22, Hans, Sophie, and Christoph were put on trial. The trial was resided over by Roland Freisler, a hard judge who gave death sentences to about 90% of the trials he presided over. When asked to speak, Christoph attempted to be released, stating that he suffered from a psychotic depression stemming from the fact that his wife was sick with child bed fever. When this tactic didn't work, he pleaded with the judge to spare him on account of his children. Freisler didn't listen to his plea, even when Hans Scholl offered to take all the punishment for Christoph if only Freisler would let Christoph go free. At around 2 pm, Freisler announced the verdict. Hans, Sophie, and Christoph were guilty. The punishment was death, to be carried out immediately that same day. Christoph was hustled to a prison cell, where he wrote his last letters. Christoph, who was technically not associated with any religion, although he had accepted Catholicism long ago, asked to be baptized into the Catholic faith before he died. For a few minutes before his death, Hans, Sophie, and Christoph were allowed to be together for a short time. While there, Christoph is credited with saying, \"I didn't know dying could be so easy.\" A few minutes after 5 pm. Christoph was put under the guillotine. He didn't get to see his wife or children before he died.\nOn November 3, 1999, Christoph, who was baptized as a Catholic just minutes before his execution, was declared a Martyr of the Catholic Church."}

The three men are representations of Confucius, Gautama Buddha and Laozi and represent the three greatest Chinese philosophical traditions and the predominant attitude towards the life of each one of them.\nThe confucianism sees the life like somthing sour that needs rules to correct the degeneration of the people's attitudes.

By the age of 11, he made three full length children films and emerged as one of the youngest filmmakers in India. Asian News International named Priyakanta as \"Manipur's Rising Star\". Asian News International wrote \"Youth like Priyakanta are brand ambassadors for change that can take place in the Manipur and are a source of inspiration for many.\" He himself wrote scripts, directed and edited the films. And all this was done without any help from any experts. Laishram was not trained under any director. It was his determination to follow his passion that prompted him to learn and excel at filmmaking. His first full length children film Lamuknarure followed by Achumbadi Amarni and Chan-Thoibi were screened in 2009. The crew members for the films were his friends and family members. His works gained recognition in Northeast India and he received certificates of appreciation from many organisations.

The film was nominated in many categories and won several awards including Best Filmmaker For A Cause and Jury's Special Mention Award at various national and international level short film festivals. Priyakanta said \"It\u2019s Not My Choice says that it is not by choice that homosexual/transgender people are homosexuals/transgenders. The general public thinks that homosexuality is a genetic defect or it is because of wrong upbringing and socialisation. They have that wrong concept in their mind that\u00a0 someone\u2019s\u00a0 sexual preference or sexuality can easily be changed through proper medication or yoga. I am saying that being gay or trans is a part of normal range of human sexuality. It\u2019s not a mutation, but rather very much like the genetic regions that determine the colour of your hair.\"Priyakanta was featured in one of the India's leading LGBT Magazine Gaylaxy (magazine). He also voiced his opinions against Section 377 at various platforms including The Northeast Today. Priyakanta said, \"\"The Supreme Court's ruling is a disappointing setback to human dignity, freedom and the basic rights to privacy and non-discrimination.So it is time for Section 377 to go, like we did away with Sati, with the custom of widows non remarriage, slavery, casteism and so many other uncivilized practices, we should do away with Section 377 and it is time to decriminalize homosexuality so as to clarify that India is an Independent country. And the Supreme Court is empowered to do it\".\"Priyakanta's next internationally acclaimed film I AM SPECIAL came in 2017. \"I AM SPECIAL\" is a Docufiction film based on the real life stories of six differently abled persons.

In 2018, he made a short film based on Gender neutrality titled \"Who Said Boys Can't Wear Make Up.\" The video broke all barriers and tackled a sensitive issue brilliantly.

A small group of survivors under June wander through the desert and are followed by Vorox.\nSomehow years later the Autobot scout Lola Bunny (A honesty, disguises, helpful, incredibly, intelligent, talk constantly, speaking exactly and friendly Bunny) lands on Earth, somewhere in the suburbs, and takes on the form of a brown Rabbit, to disguise herself from humans.\nThe Decepticon Fung lands in a physical barrier for any current Te Xuan Ze where he attacks on the border of Orchid Bay and takes on its form as a Crocodile to disguise himself from humans, He then attacks a Skull Lake, before sending his minion Kraang Droids, to chases and kill all the survivors to prevent from calling for help using mobile communication vehicles. Afterwards, Fung searches for top secret data about the AllSpark from the remains of SOCCENT through computer terminals kept inside Software towers, but in the process accidentally sends a Morse Code signal informing Stealth Bombers and F-22s of his location.\nUpon defeating a group of Decepticon drones, Lola learns that Dexter couldn't accept that his sister was dead and began to make an android of her. But he wanted to make that gynoid as human as possible so he used real human organs in the gynoid. Suddenly Dexter heard voices of a mutant Jack Russell Terrier named Otis but Lola Bunny saves them, defeating Otis, Afterwards, he is contacted by Autobot leader Minerva Jane Squigglytail (kind-hearted, caring, understanding, supportive, selfless, serious, highly intelligent, calculating and wise Mouse) who informs that Dexter's past in possession of an artifact which could lead them to the AllSpark and, as such, must be protected at all costs. Ms. Mimi and her other surviving Autobots - Rex (a gruff, grumpy, fairly friendly highly intelligent, and aggressive tyrannosaurs) Larry (a hungry, fast-talking courageous and capable fighter, Medic Officer, hadrosaur) and Milli (A sweet, cute, generous and true brave. She is the only female member, and the leader of Team Umizoomi) soon land on Earth and assume alternate forms as well (namely a Mouse, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, Lambeosaurus and Elf). After they meet with Lola Bunny Dexter comes and gathers his allies and friends in his lab. The latter gives them the artifact - his grandfather's glasses - and Ms. Mimi tells Dexter that it's nice to depend on your friends as part of a team. Larry explain is proceeds to explain to the two humans their mission on Earth: to find the Omnitrix and use it to revitalize their homeworld of dimension, that the Decepticon leader Vilgax currently trapped in the an alternate history, burned the location of the Omnitrix in Dexter's grandfather's glasses for the Decepticons to find.\nDuring this time, the Decepticon second commander Mandark, is gathering an army to retrieve the Omnitrix and arrives at an airbase, which he destroys after recruiting Brawl, and Sky Man. The Autobots' location is detected by the Sector 7 agency and helicopters are sent to capture them. Milli used Karate to creates a distraction, allowing the others to escape, but the Autobots are then attacked by another group of Decepticon drones, led by Hydra a monster with five heads Ms. Mimi used an energy sword to cut it's head but Hydra's wound, as three separate writhing heads sprout from the wound, admiring each other before beginning the rematch. Knowing the Hydra gave them enough trouble with just one head, Ms. Mimi and her other Autobots team attack Hydra. Together they soar into the sky as the hero fights back, to little avail. With each head Lola slices off, three more grow in its place (to the point that they start sprouting four and even five heads at a time). Frantically, Autobots fight the drones, with Ms. Mimi punches the cliff, which causes an avalanche of rocks to fall. The Hydra freezes as all of her heads look up in fear, then she is crushed and buried in a mountain of rocks, ultimately defeating her for good. Dexter, and Lola Bunny are captured by Auntie Roon is an ancient evil witch who was banished from the magic realm by the mighty Te Xuan Ze of her time. Decoding Decepticon's transmissions, the Autobots then discover that Mandark, Vilgax's second-in-command, has also learned about the Omnitrix and Vilgax's whereabouts. Lola and Dexter are imprisoned at the Hoover Dam, but the former manages to escape following a power outage, While exploring the base, she stumbles upon the frozen Vilgax, and his Omnitrix. As Vilgax partially unfreezes himself, he attacks Lola Bunny who manages to retrieve the Omnitrix, and escape with Dexter. Mandark and Fung then attack the dam and free Vilgax.\nThe Autobots travel to the Dark Island with her Omnitrix whose power surges transform ordinary machines into Jackbots attack Lola While Rex protects Lola, Milli and Starfire defeats Fung, Sky man and Mandark got away, but is then killed by Brawl who is in turn defeated by Rex. Meanwhile, Lola fights back to the two boys (Butch and Brick). They are still irked, but after a tense moment defeating two boys by Lola Bunny, then she is quickly subdued by Overlord (as Vilgax) as heading to Ninjago City, a huge vortex in the sky.\nDetermined to protect the city, Dareth challenges the advancing tank, but the Overlord drives him off with a few shots from the tank's side-mounted turrets. As a corrupted Monstrous Dee Dee looks on and Dareth wonders where the ninja are, the Garmatron continues to fire shots into the city, spreading Dark Matter everywhere\u2014atop the tank, massive wings emerge from the Overlord's back.\nAfter the Autobots travel to Ninjago city, shortly after they are all autobots surrounded by Kozu\u2014at his command, the Stone Army opens fire on the Ultra Dragon. Dexter slashes at a group of Stone Warriors. But The mech's arm gets shot off. Monstrous Dee Dee laughs and keeps shooting at him until he falls over. They jump out and fight for Dexter, He makes a windshield to protect them from Dark Matter. She breaks the Ice. She retreats back up the building. The Autobots are outnumbered. Ms. Mimi quickly explains to the other two that whoever wears the Helmet of Shadows controls the Stone Army. The older leader autobots trio sets off in search of the helmet, only to see Dareth putting it on his head; back at the fortress, the Stone Army freezes moments they destroyed it by Autobots Dragon used flamethrower and Explosion, The Autobots climbing the stairs but are forced to land when a shot clips its tail. Meanwhile the autobots's numbers slowly dwindle due to their enemies' relentless assault; Lola and Rex are corrupted by the Overlord's darkness, Larry stays back to fight his infected teammates, and Ms. Mimi quickly kicks Auntie Roon's turret to keep her occupied, leaving Dexter said that he couldn't care since he hasn't have a sister, but Mandark says he has and that she is called Olga Astronomonov. He told Dexter about her and became mad and thought that Dexter was going to try to kill his sister, to get even with him. So Mandark called a giant Cluster to battle Dexter. The Cluster grabbed Dexter and he became unconsious, and couldn't escape. The Overlord opens his mouth and blasts Dexter with Darkness, nearly pushing him off the building. He looks back at the city beneath him. Dexter looks back at the Overlord. But Its block by a Black seed turns the fuse together into a single Girl with the powers of all seven (Spirit becomes the \"Diamond Sister\") Energy force field grows, harming the Overlord. She's gi has changed to a rainbow color.\nThe Overlord swipes at Diamond Sister and the latter is pushed back. Diamond Sister blocks his wing and is kicked backward. Diamond Sister counterattacks. She kicks the Overlord, sending him back Dexter was saved by a Dragon on his back, and summons her seven sisters to turn into a Golden Dragon. The Golden Dragon tackles the Overlord, and they are both sent falling downward. Both dragons nearly crash into Dareth. The latter covers his head. The two dragons move upward.\nThe Overlord surrounds her with a cloud of shadow, allowing himself to grow in size.

The Overlord implodes, and the fog engulfing, then crashing Overlord's fortress buried by a mountain with all the colours of the rainbow the entire city disappears, with everyone who was corrupted turned back to normal. Ms. Mimi awakens to find that both Dexter, Lola Bunny, Larry, and Rex are back to normal. Then Papa Smurf wonders if they did it\u2014in response, Dareth says they all did it 200 Smurfs, Dwarfs, Fairly, and lots of people gather both Autobots and save their city vowing to be ready if the Overlord ever does try to return. Dexter's mood quickly turns melancholy, however, as Ms. Mimi tells him that everyone will miss his sister.

The population was 10,180 at the 2010 census. \nBohemia is bordered by Central Islip and Great River to the west; Islandia, Ronkonkoma and Lake Ronkonkoma to the north; Holbrook to the east; and Oakdale, Sayville, West Sayville, and Bayport to the south.\nThe school district in the town is the Connetquot School District. The zip code is 11716 and the telephone area code is 631.\nThe town is near the Oakdale and Ronkonkoma rail road stations of the Long Island Rail Road, providing easy access to Manhattan where many residents work.\nLong Island MacArthur Airport is partially located in Bohemia (along with the bordering town of Ronkonkoma, New York). The airport serves travelers from the Greater New York Metropolitan Area and around the nation who want a more convenient alternative to the congestion at JFK and Laguardia airports. The airport's most popular destinations include: Orlando, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; West Palm Beach, Florida; and Las Vegas, Nevada.\nConnetquot River State Park is located in Bohemia. The park provides areas for horses. \nHistory.\nThe earliest natives of Bohemia were the Secatogue tribe of the Algonquian peoples.\nBohemia was founded in 1855 by Slavic immigrants. \nFor 100 years, Bohemia remained a very small village. At the time of the centennial in 1955, the population was about 3,000. Today there about 11,000 inhabitants from many national and ethnic backgrounds.\nLocal cigar industry.\nImmigrants that came to Bohemia had good cigar-making skills. There used to be several cigar making factories in the town. Two notable cigar factories were Albert Kovanda's factory, on the corner of Lakeland and Smithtown Avenues, and the M. Foster Cigar Factory, at Ocean Avenue and Church Street. The local cigar industry continued until the 1930s.\nName change.\nOver the years, there have been a number of attempts to change the name of Bohemia, which some people felt was too tied to one ethnic group. They felt this was keeping new people and new businesses from coming to the town. Proposed names have included: Sayville Heights or North Sayville, after the town immediately to the south; Lidice, after a Czech town destroyed by Nazi troops during World War II; and MacArthur, after the airport built in the 1940s (the airport is named for controversial American General Douglas MacArthur). None of the attempts to change the name received enough support for the change.\nGeography.\nBohemia is located in New York at (40.770042, \u221273.113760).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of .\nBohemia Historical Society.\nBohemia Historical Society (BHS) was founded in 1984. This non-profit local organization provides classes, slide presentations, community activities, a newsletter, its own website and its own museum. The museum was opened on April 26, 2009, and it has on display a number of exhibits depicting life in the early days of Bohemia, a photograph collection, and a book collection that includes many historical Czech manuscripts. Additionally, the building is the BHS's meeting place.\nConnetquot River State Park.\nConnetquot River State Park Preserve hosts 3,473 acres of land and water for the protection and propagation of game birds, fish and animals. The preserve has 50 miles of hiking, horseback riding, cross-country ski and nature trails, as well as fishing on the Connetquot River.\nEducation.\nDistrict: Connetquot School District\nHigh School: Connetquot High School, grades 9\u201312\nElementary: Sycamore Avenue School, Edward J. Bosti Elementary, Idle Hour Elementary and John Pearl Elementary, grades K-5\nGrades 6\u20138 are serviced by the Oakdale-Bohemia Middle School, located in neighboring Oakdale, New York (formerly known as Oakdale-Bohemia Junior High School). Another middle school is Ronkonkoma Middle School.\nThe Branford Hall Career Institute is located on Johnson Avenue\nThe Dellacave Institute for Professional Development is located on Sycamore Avenue. The Institute offers a wide variety of courses designed for continued professional growth for lifetime learners.\nClimate.\nThe climate in this area has hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

Hamlets usually have names based off of a local school district, post office, or fire district. Because a hamlet has no government of its own, the town it is in provides municipal services and government.\nSuffolk County makes maps that give hamlet boundaries, but towns with Suffolk County also publish maps that conflict both in the number of hamlets and their boundaries. Nevertheless, all land not within a village is administered by the town.\nMost of the rest of New York's hamlets have less defined boundaries, and most towns have areas that are not considered to be a part of any hamlet. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) puts hamlet names on rectangular green signs with white lettering at roadside locations of its choosing. The NYSDOT and local governments also provide community identification signs on some scenic byways to be placed at the roadside boundaries of hamlets, as decided by the sign provider. Many hamlets have welcome signs at the gateways to the hamlets.\nSome hamlets are former villages that have ended their incorporation (Old Forge in Herkimer County; Rosendale, in Ulster County; and Andes in Delaware County, for example)."}

He was elevated to the status of National Hero of Indonesia in 2004. His notable works also are recognised as\u00a0Intangible Cultural Heritage\u00a0by the\u00a0Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture.\nLife.\nBackground.\nRaja Ali Haji was born in Penyengat (nowadays part of Riau Islands Province) in 1808 or 1809, and ethnically Bugis through the patrilineality and matrilineality kinship. His father, Raja Haji Ahmad was the son of Raja Ali Haji Fisabilillah bin Daeng Celak, who are the Bugis warrior originating from Sulawesi. His mother, Encik Hamidah binti Malik was a cousin of her father and also of Bugis descent. \nEarly life.\nIn 1822 when Raja Ali Haji was young, he was taken by his parents to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta).\u00a0At that time, his father,\u00a0Raja Haji Ahmad, became Riau's envoy to meet the Governor General Baron van der Capellen.\u00a0For several times, Raja Haji Ahmad regarded to became the envoy of the Riau kingdom to Java, and during his tenure, that opportunity was used by his son Raja Ali to meet many scholars to deepen his Islamic knowledge, especially the science of \"fiqh\".\u00a0Among the Betawi scholars, Raja Ali Haji often visited Saiyid Abdur Rahman al-Mashri, he had the opportunity to study astronomy with him.\u00a0Apart from being able to deepen his knowledge of Islam, Raja Ali Haji also gained a lot of experience and knowledge due to his social networking skill with Dutch cultural scholars, such as T. Roode and Van Der Waal who later became his close friends.\nAbout the year of 1827 C.E. or 1243 H. (Islamic lunar year system), Raja Ali Haji following his father Raja Ahmad went to Makkah al-Musyarrafah to perform the pilgrimage ().\u00a0Raja Ahmad and Raja Ali Haji were among the first children of Riau kings to perform the pilgrimage in that era.\u00a0Raja Ali Haji lived and studied in Mecca for quite some time.\u00a0While in Mecca, Raja Ali Haji had the opportunity to associate with Sheikh Daud bin Abdullah al-Fathani.\u00a0He had the opportunity to study several areas of Islam and Arabic language with Sheikh Daud bin Abdullah al-Fathani who was then the Chief Sheikh of Hajj (pilgrimage) and very influential among the native Indonesians community in Mecca.\u00a0He was friends with one of the sons of Sheikh Muhammad Arsyad bin Abdullah al-Banjari, namely Sheikh Syihabuddin bin Sheikh Muhammad Arsyad bin Abdullah al-Banjari.\u00a0Probably around that time,\u00a0Raja Ali Haji managed to invite the ulama from Banjar to come to Riau, and if the ulama agreed to come, the ulama would be made Mufti in the Riau kingdom.\u00a0On his way to Mecca, Raja Haji Ahmad and his son Raja Ali Haji also took the opportunity to visit Cairo (in Egypt), and after accomplished their journey, he returned to his hometown of Penyengat Island (nowadays part of Riau Islands Province).\nNotable works and awards.\nRaja Ali, a man of affairs, was also a religious and literary scholar and did much to establish Riau as the\u00a0intellectual\u00a0centre of the Malay world in the mid-19th century. His own writings include several\u00a0didactic\u00a0texts, such as\u00a0\"Muqaddimah fi intiz\u0101m\"\u00a0(1857; \u201cIntroduction to Order\u201d) on the duties of kings, a Johnsonian dictionary of Malay usage,\u00a0\"Kitab Pengetahuan Bahasa\"\u00a0(\u00a01869; \u201cBook of Linguistic Knowledge\u201d), and the historical work of\u00a0\"Silsilah Melayu dan Bugis\" (1865; \u201cMalay and Bugis Genealogy\u201d). His most outstanding contribution to learning, however, is the\u00a0history\u00a0begun by his father that he rewrote and expanded as the\u00a0\"Tuhfat al-Nafis\"\u00a0(\u00a01866; \u201cPrecious Gift\u201d), which remains an invaluable source for the history of the Kra Peninsula,\u00a0Borneo ( Kalimantan in native language), and\u00a0Sumatra.\nIn 2004, Raja Ali Haji awarded as one of the National Heroes of Indonesia by the national government of the Republic Indonesia due to his revolutionary and persistent works.\nDeath.\nRaja Ali Haji died in 1872 at his hometown, Penyengat Island (nowadays part of Riau Islands Province), but the precise date of his death was debated. Among the best-known evidences was a letter written in 1872 when Raja Ali Haji wrote a letter to Herman Von De Wall, a Dutch cultural scholar, who later died at Tanjung Pinang in 1873."}

It is named after the Musi river, one of the important rivers in Sumatra since ancient times, notably during the Srivijayan empire era. As one of the indigenous or native languages in South Sumatra, Musi language closely related to another languages in South Sumatra notably Palembang and Malay, but however those languages are not mutually intelligible. Musi language itself had dominant linguitic elements influence from the Kawi and Madurese languages. \nMusi is the most spoken language in Musi Banyuasin region, which eventually make this language also called informally as 'Banyuasin language' by the locals, but several neighboring region also show significant population of Musi speakers. Musi language is one of the languages of the West Indonesian language of Music language family together with the Col Lembak language (a native language of Lembak people in South Sumatra).\nDialects.\nMusi language has several dialect which differs to one another, some of the dialects tend to had borrowing elements from another language, the Sekayu dialect for instance is one of the Musi dialects that tend to had close similarity with Malay language due to the excessive usage of \"-\u00ea\" as the suffix, this dialect also cause the confusion to categorize the Musi under the Malay family language or not, but however another dialects in Musi language are not closely related to Malay language at all. One of the dialects of Musi language that tend to be confused with another language is a dialect of Palembang Lawas that shared major characteristic with the Palembangese, which is a native language of Palembang people originating from the Palembang region in South Sumatra. \nThe dialects in Musi language has at least 12 dialects:\nHistory.\nOriginally, the Musi language spoken by Musi people who are the inhabitants of the Musi region in South Sumatra. As one of the important port regions in ancient times, the traders from Java and Madura play significant roles in shaping the Musi language itself, most of loanwords in Musi language are borrowed or derived directly and indirectly from the Kawi Old Javanese and Madurese. \nPhonology.\nThe\u00a0phonetics\u00a0and\u00a0phonology\u00a0of the Musi language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of\u00a0phonemes\u00a0(i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.\u00a0Dunggio (1983) lists 26 phonemes for the Palembang dialect; specifically, there are 20 consonants and 6 vowels. However, another study by Aliana (1987) states that there are only 25 phonemes in Musi, reanalyzing as and allophone of and instead.\nVowels.\nIn closed syllables, and are realized as and , respectively.\nLoanwords.\nHistorically, the Musi language had many influences from the linguistic elements of other languages, especially from Kawi and Madurese languages."}

There, he worked as a fashion photographer for agencies and magazines. It was in this creative atmosphere that he founded Resuer Magazine, an international fashion magazine that highlights emerging photographers. He returned to Florence in 2017 and began focusing on the nude as his primary genre.\nStyle.\nGiven his biography, it is clear that Glauso is an Italian photographer, but his work is much more universal. His process involves a commitment to a cosmopolitan process. Glauso travels to capital cities throughout Europe for casting and shooting, enriching his narratives and broadening his influences.\nThough he retains an Italian sense of couture from his days in Milan, his exploration of the body taps into a stripped down eroticism, something more ancient and primal.\nThis universality is handled within a thoroughly human-built setting, mostly interior spaces. His work is not so much urban as human. The retreats of the bed, hallway and bathroom are primary shooting spaces that create the confidential feeling his images produce.\nGlauso often plays with seclusion, focusing on a single model in a confined space. The effect is private, seductive, intimate. Sifting through his photographs is like standing at the edge of a scandal or a broken promise a delicate balance between lust and subtlety.\nPrize.\nHonorable Mention 2021 International Photography Awards"}

After being held for a few weeks, Werner was released, but the imprisonment left a mark on him. \nIn the Summer of 1939, Werner became the first member of the Scholl family to make an open resistance to the Nazi regime. He resigned from the Hitler Youth, a decision that barred him from being able to take the Arbitur (The test to be able to enter a University). Werner also climbed on top of the statue of Justice at the Courtroom in Ulm to blindfold the Lady of Justice with a swastika flag.\nIn 1942, Werner was sent out to the Russian front, where, by chance, he was stationed near Hans. The two were able to see each other fairly often.\nIn February 1943, Werner was given a leave to go home to Ulm. When he came home, he found out that Sophie and Hans had been captured by the Gestapo. Along with his parents, Werner travelled to Munich for the trial, storming into the courtroom just as Roland Freisler was about to give the verdict. After a brief stand-off, the Scholl parents were removed from the room. Because Werner had an army uniform on, he was able to melt into the crowd and be there when the judge announced the verdict: guilty. As those in the courtroom got up to leave, Werner was able to push his way up to see Hans and Sophie one last time. Werner grabbed their hands. Tears welled in his eyes as Hans said to him, \u201cStay strong. Make no concessions!\u201d After his leave was up, Werner was stationed back at Russia. In the middle of 1944, Werner was classified as Missing in Action. He was 22."}

It is a decoration of the Temple of Al-Lat in Palmyra, Syria. On 27 June 2015, it was badly damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The damage took place after the ISIL had captured Palmyra. The statue was kept at the National Museum of Damascus for repairing. Presently, it is standing again.\nDescription.\nThe statue of the lion is shown as holding a gazelle. It was made from limestone ashlars in the early first century A.D. It measured in height. It weights 15 tonnes. The lion was regarded as the husband of goddess Al-l\u0101t. The gazelle depicts Al-l\u0101t's tender and loving traits. Bloodshed was not allowed under punishment of Al-l\u0101t's revenge. The lion's left paw had a partially damaged Palmyrene inscription. The inscription (PAT 1122) reads like this: \"tbrk \u02be\"[\"lt\"] (Al-l\u0101t will bless) \"mn dy l\u02bey\u0161d\" (whoever will not shed) \"dm \u02bfl \u1e25gb\u02be\" (blood in the sanctuary).\nHistory.\nIn 1977, the statue was discovered by some Polish archeologists from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw (PCMA UW). They were working under Prof. Micha\u0142 Gawlikowski. The PCMA UW logo design was based on the lion of Al-l\u0101t. The statue was\nfound in pieces. It had been reused in old times for the temple's foundation. Later, the pieces were collected in front of the gate of the Palmyra Museum. The work was done by restorer J\u00f3zef Gazy. In 2005, it was restored to prevent problems from collection. Finally, the piece was restored. It was made like its original looks \u2013 a relief art jumping out from a wall. During the Syrian Civil War, the statue was covered with a metal plate and sandbags.

David was asked why he chose the goalkeeper position in a youth tournament interview and he said, \n\u201cBack in fourth grade, we always played against the older grades at break time and we lost every single time. It was not fun anymore. We kept on losing because everyone was too scared to take the position of goalkeeper because they were afraid of handling shots from older kids.

I\u2019m not going to lie to you and tell you that I was saving everything and being that heroic goalkeeper. It was a rough experience for me, I made many mistakes, and I grew from that and I began to develop into the guy I am today.

He is often identified with \u015aakra in Chinese Buddhist cosmology. In Korean mythology, he is known as Haneullim.\nThe Jade Emperor is known by many names. Some names include (1) the Heavenly Grandfather (, '), which originally meant \"Heavenly Duke\", (2) the Jade Lord; (3) the Highest Emperor; (4) Great Emperor of Jade (, ' or , \"\").\nMythology.\nThe Jade Emperor was originally the assistant of the Divine Master of the Heavenly Origin, Yuanshi Tianzun. Yuanshi Tianzun is the supreme beginning, the limitless and eternal creator of Heaven and Earth. He picked Yu-huang, or the Jade Emperor, as his personal successor.\nThe Jade Emperor will later be succeeded by the Heavenly Master of the Dawn of Jade of the Golden Door (). The characters for both are shown on the front of the arms of his throne.\nIn two traditional writing texts produced in 1925 and 1972, Guan Yu became the 18th Jade Emperor in about 1840 AD. However, some have disagreed that Guan Yu has succeeded. And thus the Jade Emperor and Guan Yu are often worshiped separately. In Tienti teaching, the ruling Jade Emperor has 55 predecessors. However, this is from the opinion of the Chinese folk religion. Many Taoists do not believe these claims to be true.\nFestivals.\nThe Jade Emperor's Birthday () falls on the ninth day of the first lunar month.

In present days, the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program was named after her.\nStory.\nThere are many stories about Chang'e. The following is about the origin of the Mid-Autumn Festival. In one version, long time ago, Chang'e was a beautiful woman. Ten suns had risen together into the skies. They had scorched the Earth. Thus, it caused hardship for the people. Houyi, the archer, shot down nine of them. He left just one Sun. He was given either two or one with enough for two elixirs of immortality as a reward. He did not drink it directly. He let Chang'e keep it with her because he did not want to be immortal without his beloved wife. However, while Houyi went out hunting, his enemy Fengmeng went into his house. And he tried to force Chang'e to give the elixir to him. She drank them instead of giving them to Fengmeng. Then, Chang'e flew upward past the heavens. There, she chose the Moon as her home. As she loved her husband, she wanted to live nearby him. That is why she chose the moon. Houyi found out what had happened and felt sorry. So, he displayed the fruits and cakes that Chang'e had enjoyed. Then, he killed himself. \nIn older versions of the story, Chang'e stole the elixir from Houyi. Then, she drank it and flew away to the Moon. Then, her husband could not go after her. Chang'e appears in Wu Cheng'en's late 16th-century novel, \"Journey to the West\"."}

Similar holidays are celebrated in Japan, Korea, and across many Southeast Asian regions.\nIt is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture. Its popularity is at the same level with that of Chinese New Year. The history of the Mid-Autumn Festival dates back to 3,000 years back. The festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. It is celebrated in a full moon night. It is during the mid-September to early October according to the Gregorian calendar. On this day, the Chinese believe that the moon is at its brightest and fullest size. This coincides with the harvesting time in the middle of Autumn.\nLanterns of all sizes and shapes, are carried and displayed. This symbolises that light brings people's way to prosperity and good luck. Mooncakes, are traditionally eaten during this festival. These are mostly filled with sweet-bean, egg yolk, meat or lotus-seed paste. The Mid-Autumn Festival is based on the story of Chang'e, the moon goddess in Chinese mythology.\nCelebrations.\nMoon worship.\nAn important part of the festival celebration is Moon worship. The ancient Chinese people believed in renewing associated with the Moon and water. This concept is related to the menstruation of women. So, they called it \"monthly water\".\nLanterns.\nA very important part of celebrating the festival is carrying the bright lanterns and lighting them on towers or floating sky lanterns. Another tradition involving lanterns is to write riddles on them and have other people try to guess the answers ().\nLantern usages were not combined with Moon-worship before the Tang dynasty. Traditionally, the lantern has been used to represent fertility. The laterns act mainly as a toy and decoration. But today the lantern has come to depict the festival itself. In the old days, lanterns were made in the image of natural things, myths and local cultures. As time passed, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by their neighbors.\nAs China gradually evolved from a farming society to a mixed farming and trading one, traditions from other festivals began to be brought into the Mid-Autumn Festival. For example, the putting of lanterns on rivers to help the souls of the drowned as practiced during the Ghost Festival. During the Qing dynasty, Hong Kong fishermen would put up lanterns on their boats for the Ghost Festival. They keep the lanterns up until Mid-Autumn Festival."}

It lives in pieces of wood and can sometimes be found in the wooden parts of old buildings. The adult beetle is brown and about long. Eggs are laid in dark crevices in old wood inside buildings, trees, and inside tunnels left behind by previous larvae. The larvae bore into the timber. Larvae feed for up to ten years before pupating, and later emerging from the wood as adult beetles. Timber that has been damp and is affected by fungal decay is soft enough for the larvae to chew through. They use enzymes present in their gut to digest the cellulose and hemicellulose in the wood.\nThe larvae of deathwatch beetles weaken the structural timbers of a building by tunneling through them. Treatment with insecticides to kill the larvae is largely ineffective, and killing the adult beetles when they emerge in spring and early summer may be a better option. However, infestation by these beetles is often limited to historic buildings, because modern buildings tend to use softwoods for joists and rafters instead of aged oak timbers, which the beetles prefer.\nTo attract mates, the adult insects create a tapping or ticking sound that can sometimes be heard in the rafters of old buildings on summer nights; therefore, the deathwatch beetle is associated with quiet, sleepless nights and is named for the vigil (watch) being kept beside the dying or dead. By extension, a superstition has grown up that these sounds are an omen of impending death."}
