{"id": "699631", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=699631", "title": "History of Kansas", "text": "The first people who lived in Kansas were Native Americans who were nomadic (people who don't live in one place for very long). They hunted American bison. In the 1500s, Spanish conquistadores came to explore the place. Later, French fur trappers came to the area. They traded with the Native Americans. The United States added most of Kansas in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act opened the place for Americans to move there. A lot of fighting happened because the new residents had to decide if they wanted slavery. The new residents decided to make slavery illegal. The fighting helped start the American Civil War.\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas had many frontier towns. The railroads were stops for cattle drives from Texas. Many black people moved from the south to Kansas. These people were called \"exodusters\". Farmers tried growing corn and raising pigs, but there was little rain, so they were not able to. They started growing wheat. They became very good at growing wheat, and they had enough to trade with Europe. Many angry farmers joined the Populist and Progressive movement in the 1890s, and they supported it until the 1940s. Since the 1940s, Kansas has been a very conservative state. Since 1945, the number of farmers has lowered, and manufacturing has become more popular.\nBefore history.\nIn 12000 BCE, the first people came to Kansas. These people were paleolithic people who were related to Asians. Once they came, they never left. They saw mammoths, camels, ground sloths, and horses. They hunted these animals until they were extinct.\nBecause the big game they had been hunting died out, the people had started eating more plants and small animals. They foraged during the season across the plains. In order to get more food, they started being less nomadic. This means that they decided to stay in one place for a longer time. The groups did not stop hunting, but they also ate wild plants and small animals. Their tools became different. Their tools started being able to grind and chop. This means that seeds, fruits, and plants became a bigger part of their diet. They would grind seeds into rough flour. Around 3500BCE, the people started making ceramics. Pottery-making societies started.\nAgriculture begins.\nFor most of the Archaic period, people did not change the land in any big way. The groups outside the area, particularly in Mesoamerica, started major inventions. These inventions would include growing maize. Other groups in North America aslo started growing maize as well. Some archaic groups stopped being food gatherers (people who look for food). Instead, they started being food producers (people who grow food) around 3,000 years ago. They also had many of the cultural things that are seen with semi-sedentary agricultural life: storage containers, permanent housing, bigger settlements, and cemeteries or burial grounds. People in the northern part of Kansas lived in small buildings made out of dirt; they were shaped like a rectangle. People in the southern part of Kansas lived in houses with thatched grass all over them. There were more people being born, and they lived in villages. El Quartelejo was an Indian pueblo that was the farthest north. This settlement is the only pueblo in Kansas from which archaeologists have found anything.\nEven though the groups started farming, they still did not do much to change their environment. Wild food was still an important part of their diet even after the invention of pottery and the creation of irrigation. Agriculture never made them stop hunting and foraging, even in the biggest Archaic societies.\nEarly Europeans.\nIn 1541, Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado came to Kansas to explore. He turned around near Lindsborg, Kansas. He met some of the local Native Americans. He gave them horses. The Native Americans started changing their lifestyle because of the horses.\nIn the 1600s, the Kansa people and the Osage Nation came to Kansas. The Kansa people lived near the Kansas River, and the Osage Nation lived near the Arkansas River. The Pawnee people lived in western Kansas. The Pawnee lived in western Kansas because there were a lot of bison. The French commander at Fort Orleans, \u00c9tienne de Bourgmont, visited the Kansas River in 1724. He built a trading post there. This was near the main Kansa village at the mouth of the river. Around the same time, the Otoe tribe of the Sioux also lived in areas around the northeast corner of Kansas.\nLouisiana Purchase.\nOther than short explorations, neither France nor Spain created any cities in Kansas. In 1763, Spain got all of the French land west of the Mississippi River. This was because France lost the Seven Years' War. Spain gave this land back to France in 1803.\nIn 1803, Kansas was added to the United States as land from the Louisiana Purchase. The Lewis and Clark Expedition started in St. Louis. In 1804, they came to Kansas in what is today Kansas City, Kansas. They met French fur trappers who knew the land well. In 1806, explorer Zebulon Pike came to Kansas. He called it the \"Great American Desert\" because it had no trees or plants. The U.S. government saw Kansas as a desert too, so they sent Native Americans to it. They believed it was not good land, so they didn't care if Native Americans were sent there.\nFrom June 4, 1812 until August 10, 1821, the land was part of the Missouri Territory. Missouri became a state, so the land became unorganized. It had no people living in it except for Fort Leavenworth. The Fort was created in 1827 by Henry Leavenworth with the 3rd U.S Infantry from St. Louis, Missouri; it is the first permanent European settlement in Kansas. The fort was created as the westernmost outpost of the American military. It was created to protect trade along the Santa Fe Trail from Native Americans. The trade came from the East. It came either by land using the Boone's Lick Road, or by water using the Missouri River.\nPart of the Santa Fe Trail went through Kansas. It was used by people who were on the Oregon Trail.\n1820s-1840s: Indian Territory.\nIn the 1820s, the U.S. government gave the land to the Native Americans as Indian Territory. They did not let white people come to the territory. On June 3, 1825, the U.S. government took 20 million acres of land (81000\u00a0km\u00b2) from the Kansa people. The Kansa people had to stay on a small amount of land in northeastern Kansas. The U.S. government also made the Osage Nation live in a small amount of land in southeastern Kansas.\nBy a treaty on November 7, 1825, the Shawnee people were moved to Kansas. By a treaty on September 29, 1829, the Delaware people were moved to Kansas.\nThe Indian Removal Act made this faster. By a treaty on August 30, 1831, the Ottawa people were moved to a small part of Kansas. On October 24, 1832, the Kickapoo people were moved to Kansas. On October 29, 1832, the Piankeshaw and Wea people were moved to Kansas. To their east was the western border of Missouri, and to their west was the Kaskaskia and Peoria people. On September 21, 1833, the Otoe people were moved to Kansas.\nBy September 17, 1836, the Sac and Fox people moved to Kansas, north of the Kickapoo. By a treaty on February 11, 1837, the United States moved the Pottawatomi people to Kansas. They were moved to the Osage River, which is southwest of the Missouri River. The land was in the southwest part of what is now Miami County.\nAfter a treaty in 1842, the Wyandot people were moved to an area between the Kansas River and the Missouri River. They shared the land with the Delaware people until 1843.\nEarly 1850s and organizing the territory.\nEven though there were plans made to settle Native Americans in Kansas, by 1850 white Americans were illegally squatting on their land. They really wanted the entire area to be opened for settlement. Several U.S. Army forts, including Fort Riley, were soon created deep in Indian Territory to guard travelers on the various Western trails.\nAlthough the Cheyenne and Arapahoes tribes were still discussing with the United States for land in western Kansas (the current state of Colorado), they signed a treaty on September 17, 1851. Momentum was already building to settle the land.\nKansas\u2013Nebraska Act.\nCongress started the process of creating Kansas Territory in 1852. That year, petitions were given at the first session of the 32nd Congress to organize territory of the land west of Missouri and Iowa. Nothing happened at that time. However, during the next session, on December 13, 1852, a Representative from Missouri submitted to the House of Representatives a bill. This bill would organize the Territory of Platte: all the land west of Iowa and Missouri, and going west to the Rocky Mountains. The bill was given to the United States House Committee on Territories. It passed by the full U.S. House of Representatives on February 10, 1853. However, Southern Senators stopped the progress of the bill in the Senate. They did this to discuss how the bill would affect slavery and the Missouri Compromise. Arguments about the bill and other ideas would continue for a year. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was eventually created because of this. It became law on May 30, 1854, creating the Nebraska Territory and Kansas Territory.\nNative American territory given away.\nBy the summer of 1853, it was clear that eastern Kansas would soon be opened to American settlers. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs created new treaties that would give new reservations with yearly federal money for the Native Americans.\nIn the three months before the bill passed, treaties were written at Washington with the Delaware, Otoe, Kickapoo, Kaskaskia, Shawnee, Sac, Fox and other tribes, where the biggest part of eastern Kansas, which was within one or two hundred miles of the Missouri border, was suddenly opened to white settlement. The Kansa reservation had already been made smaller by treaty in 1846.) On March 15, 1854, Otoe and Missouri Indians gave all their lands west of the Mississippi, except a small strip on the Big Blue River, to the United States. On May 6 and May 10, 1854, the Shawnees gave away , keeping only for homes. Also on May 6, 1854, the Delaware gave all their lands to the United States, except a reservation defined in the treaty. On May 17, the Iowa gave away their lands, keeping only a small reservation. On May 18, 1854, the Kickapoo also gave away their lands, except in the western part of the Territory. In 1854 lands were also given by the Kaskaskia, Peoria, Piankeshaw and Wea and by the Sac and Fox.\nThe final step in making the Natives more American was taking land from tribes and giving it to Native households. This was so they could buy and sell as European Americans would. For example, in 1854, the Chippewa (Swan Creek and Black River bands) lived of land in Franklin County, but in 1859 the area was given to individual Chippewa families.\nKansas Territory.\nThe Kansas-Nebraska Act passed on May 30, 1854, and it created the Kansas Territory. It went from the western border of Missouri to the Rocky Mountains. The southern border was the 37th parallel north, and the northern border was the 40th parallel north. Anything north of the 40th parallel was part of the Nebraska Territory. When Congress set the southern border of the Kansas Territory as the 37th parallel, they thought that the Osage southern border was also the 37th parallel. The Cherokees disagreed. They said that it was not the correct border. They said that the border of Kansas should be moved north to make room for the actual border of the Cherokee land. This became known as the Cherokee Strip controversy.\nBefore Violence.\nIn the Kansas-Nebraska Act, it said that people living in the territories could vote on whether or not to have slavery. It undid the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which did not allow slavery in any new states created north of latitude 36\u00b030'. This led to violence between people from the North and people from the South. They both tried to quickly move to Kansas to control it.\nIn a few days after the law passed, hundreds of people from Missouri moved to Kansas. These people wanted slavery. They created a group called the \"Squatter's Claim Association\" on June 10, 1854. They said that they were going to make Kansas a slave state.\nThe New England Emigrant Aid Company said they were going to make Kansas a free state. From 1854 to 1855, they sent many anti-slavery people (called \"free-staters\") to Kansas. They were important in creating Lawrence, Topeka, and Manhattan. Other anti-slavery people came from Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, and other states.\nBleeding Kansas.\nFor a while, there was not much violence. This changed on March 30, 1855. The elections happened this day. Many pro-slavery people from Missouri came to Kansas to vote for pro-slavery people. Pro-slavery people won many elections that day. Pro-slavery people controlled the Kansas government.\nFrom 1855 to 1858, there was a lot of fighting in Kansas. This was called \"Bleeding Kansas,\" and it happened shortly before the American Civil War. Battles include the Wakarusa War, the Sacking of Lawrence, the Battle of Black Jack, the Battle of Osawatomie, and the Marais des Cygnes massacre.\nOn December 1, 1855, many pro-slavery people came to Lawrence. These pro-slavery people were led by Samuel J. Jones. These people had guns. They wanted to destroy Lawrence because it was anti-slavery. The people of Lawrence were ready to defend the city. Before any fighting happened, Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon made a treaty to stop the fighting.\nOn May 21, 1856, pro-slavery people came to Lawrence, and they attacked the city. They burned the Free-State Hotel to the ground, destroyed two printing presses, and robbed homes. Only one person died, but the city was destroyed.\nThe Pottawatomie massacre happened during the night of May 24 to the morning of May 25, 1856. In what seems to be a reaction to the Sacking of Lawrence, John Brown and a group of abolitionists killed five settlers. They believed these settlers were pro-slavery. This happened north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas. Brown later said that he did not take part in the killings during the Pottawatomie massacre, but that he did approve of them. He went into hiding after the killings. Two of his sons, John Jr. and Jason, were arrested. While they were arrested, they were allegedly treated poorly. This made John Jr. mentally hurt. On June 2, Brown led a successful attack on a group of Missourians. The Missourians were led by Captain Henry Pate. This happened in the Battle of Black Jack. Pate and his men had went into Kansas to capture Brown and others. That Fall, Brown went back into hiding and did other guerrilla warfare activities.\nTerritory Constitutions.\nThe anti-slavery and pro-slavery people tried to win by writing a constitution that would make the other side lose. Anti-slavery people would try to write a constitution that made slavery illegal, and pro-slavery people would try to write a constitution that would make slavery legal. Congress would decide which one to choose.\nTopeka Constitution.\nOn November 11, 1855, free-staters wrote the Topeka Constitution. The constitution made slavery illegal. They voted for the constitution on December 15, 1855, and they sent it to Congress in March 1856. It passed the House of Representatives, but it failed in the Senate. This was because the Senate had many pro-slavery people in it.\nLecompton Constitution.\nOn November 7, 1857, pro-slavery people wrote the Lecompton Constitution. The constitution allowed slavery, but there was a vote on it. Both pro-slavery and anti-slavery people tried to stop the votes and the constitution. Eventually, it was sent to Congress. It failed in Congress because they were not able to decide if the people actually liked it.\nLeavenworth Constitution.\nA very anti-slavery legislature wrote the Leavenworth Constitution on April 3, 1858. On May 18, 1858, the people of Kansas voted for it. This constitution made slavery illegal, and it also gave more rights to women. It failed in Congress. All of this happened while the Lecompton Constitution was being written.\nWyandotte Constitution.\nOn July 29, 1859, the Wyandotte Constitution was written. The people of Kansas voted for it on October 4, 1859. This constitution made slavery illegal, but it did not have the rights for women (unlike the Leavenworth Constitution). Kansas became a free state on January 29, 1861.\nEnd of violence.\nWhen the Wyandotte Constitution was being written, pro-slavery people knew they had lost. When the pro-slavery people realized this and when John Brown left the state, the violence in Kansas stopped in 1859.\nState.\nKansas became the 34th state on January 29, 1861.\nThere were many important events that happened in Kansas during the 1860s. Kansas was in the Civil War, there were cattle drives, early prohibition, and the start of the American Indian Wars in western Kansas.\nCivil War.\nThe Wyandotte Constitution made Kansas a free state. The people of Kansas liked the Union. Kansas stayed in the Union. Pro-slavery people still attacked Kansas. Many of these pro-slavery people were from Missouri.\nAt the start of the Civil War, Kansas had no official army. They had no weapons or supplies. In 1859 and 1860, the military in Kansas were not used. They simply stopped.\nThere were 29 Confederate attacks on Kansas. The worst was Quantrill's Raid in Lawrence in 1863. It was a response to many \"Jayhawker\" attacks on Missouri.\nLawrence Massacre.\n \nAfter Union Brigadier General Thomas Ewing, Jr. ordered to put women in prison who had gave aid to Confederate guerrillas, the jail's roof fell. This killed five people. These deaths made the guerrillas in Missouri angry. On August 21, 1863, William Quantrill led Quantrill's Raid into Lawrence. He burned much of the city. They killed over 150 men and boys. Quantrill said the attack was okay to do because it would revenge for any bad things that the jayhawkers did to the Southerners.\nBaxter Springs.\nThe Battle of Baxter Springs (sometimes called the Baxter Springs Massacre) was a small battle in the War. It happened on October 6, 1863, near the modern-day town of Baxter Springs, Kansas. The Battle of Mine Creek, also known as the Battle of the Osage, was a cavalry battle. It happened in Kansas during the war.\nMarais des Cygnes.\nOn October 25, 1864, the Battle of Marais des Cygnes happened in Linn County, Kansas. This Battle of Trading Post was between Major General Sterling Price and Union forces under Major General Alfred Pleasonton. Price was pushed out by Union forces. This was after he had run away from Kansas City due to a defeat.\nIndian Wars in Kansas.\nFort Larned (central Kansas) was built in 1859 as a base of military operations against hostile Native Americans of the Central Plains. It was also built to protect traffic along the Santa Fe Trail. After 1861, it became an agency for the administration of the Central Plains Indians by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the terms of the Fort Wise Treaty of 1861.\nKansas Pacific railroad.\nIn 1863, the Union Pacific Eastern Division (renamed the Kansas Pacific in 1869) was created by the United States Congress's Pacific Railway Act. It was created to create the southern part of the transcontinental railroad alongside the Union Pacific. Pacific Railway Act also created large land grants to the railroad along its mainline. The company started construction on its main line west from Kansas City in September 1863.\nMany railroads were planned after the Civil War, but not all were actually built. The Panic of 1873 made it difficult to fund. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns. Towns that were reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. In Kansas, nearly 5000 towns were mapped out. However, by 1970 only 617 were actually used. In the mid-20th century, closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether town would survive or struggle.\nCattle drives.\nAfter the Civil War, railroads did not go to Texas. Instead, they brought their cattle to Kansas. Once in Kansas, the cattle would be sent on a train going east on the Kansas Pacific Railway.\nIn 1871, Wild Bill Hickok became marshal of Abilene, Kansas. He fought John Wesley Hardin there. After Hickok disarmed him, he ran away. Hickok was also a deputy marshal at Fort Riley. He was also a marshal at Hays in the Wild West. In the 1880s at Greensburg, Kansas, a big well was built to get water for the Santa Fe and Rock Island railroads. It is deep and in diameter. This makes it one of the world's biggest hand-dug wells.\nCoronado, Kansas was created in 1885. It was involved in one of the bloodiest county seat fights in the history of the American West. The shoot-out on February 27, 1887 left many people dead and wounded.\nExodusters.\nIn 1879, many black people left southern states and came to Kansas. They came because there was cheap land and better treatment. These people were called exodusters. They created small towns in Kansas like Nicodemus, Kansas in 1877.\nProhibition.\nOn February 19, 1881, Kansas became the first state to make alcohol illegal. This started with the temperance movement. After 1890, prohibition and progressivism came together. This created a reform movement. This movement led to four reformist governors being elected from 1905 to 1919. Those governors wanted extreme prohibitionist laws. Kansas did not make alcohol legal again until 1948. Kansas did not allow public bars to be legal until 1987. Kansas did not allow people to buy alcohol on Sundays until 2005. Many cities still do not allow that. 29 counties in Kansas are considered \"dry.\"\nFarming.\nEnvironment.\nEarly residents found that Kansas was not the \"Great American Desert\". However, they found that the weather and environment of Kansas can be very difficult to live in. Tornadoes, blizzards, droughts, hail, floods, and grasshoppers made it difficult to grow crops. Many early residents lost a lot of money trying to be a farmer in Kansas. In the 1890s, many of these people joined the Populist movement, or they moved east. In the 20th century, new technology, crop insurance, and help from the federal government made farming easier. Many immigrants (many of which were German) came to Kansas in the 20th century. They came because they heard Kansas had good dirt, cheap land, and they could get 160 acres of land to keep for free (if they were American citizens).\nFarm life.\nVery few single men worked on a farm alone. Farmers understood the need for a hard-working wife and many children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and handling the paperwork and financial details (especially after the 1930s). In the late 19th century, farm women were important in keeping the family going by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women started leaving the fields. This changed their roles within the family. New technology such as sewing and washing machines made women play domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement was promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents. It was also promoted by county fairs which showed achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm newspapers, and home economics courses in the schools. \nThere was an idea that farm life on the prairies was lonely, but rural people had a social life. They often had activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees, Grange meeting, church activities, and school functions. The women organized shared meals and potluck events. They also had visits between families.\nAgriculture manufacturing.\nIn 1947, Lyle Yost created the Hesston Manufacturing Company. The company specialized in farm equipment. The type of equipment included self-propelled windrowers and the StakHand hay harvester. In 1974, Hesston Company commissioned its first belt buckles, which became popular on the rodeo circuit and with collectors. In 1991, the American-based equipment manufacturer, AGCO Corporation, bought Hesston Corporation. Farm equipment is still manufactured in the city.\n1890s.\nIn 1896 William Allen White, editor of the \"Emporia Gazette\", got national attention after criticizing William Jennings Bryan, the Democrats, and the Populists. He did that by writing an article called \"What's the Matter With Kansas?\" White criticized Populist leaders for letting Kansas go into economic stagnation. He also criticized them for not keeping Kansas up economically with nearby states. he said the reason was because their policies were anti-business, and that it scared away economic capital from the state. The Republicans sent out hundreds of thousands of copies of the article. They did this to support William McKinley during the 1896 United States presidential election. McKinley won the small towns and cities of the state. However, Bryan won the wheat farms and won the electoral vote, even though McKinley won the national vote.\n20th century.\nProgressive era.\nKansas was a big part of the progressive movement. It has a lot of support from the middle classes, editors such as William Allen White of the \"Emporia Gazette\", and the prohibitionists of the WCTU and the Methodist Church.\nIn 1915, the El Dorado Oil Field was the first oil field that was found using science/geologic mapping. It was around the city of El Dorado. It was part of the Mid-Continent oil province. By 1918, the El Dorado Oil Field was the largest single field producer in the United States. It was responsible for 12.8% of national oil production and 9% of the world production. Some said it was as \"the oil field that won World War I\".\nBetween 1922 and 1927, there were many legal battles with the KKK. This led to the KKK no longer being in Kansas.\nThe Flag of Kansas was created in 1925.\nGreat Depression.\nThe Dust Bowl was a lot of dust storms that happened from 1930 to 1941. This was caused by a drought. The price of wheat lowered a lot, which cause a lot of farmers to leave. Because this was during the Great Depression, many unemployed men from the cities came to Kansas to work on farms.\nKansas was part of New Deal programs like Civil Works Administration, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the Works Progress Administration. These programs helped employ many Kansas men. The most important were New Deal farm programs. Those programs raised the price of wheat, and it allowed economic growth by 1936. Republican Governor Alf Landon also did emergency programs. It included a balanced budget goal. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration succeeded in raising wheat prices after 1933. This helped get rid of the biggest problems economically.\nWorld War II.\nThe most important things Kansas did to help the war effort was provide a lot of grain and send tens of thousands of men to fight. Farmers didn't like the price ceilings and quotas for wheat, and their workers moved to factories. Farmers asked Congress to not draft young farmers.\nWichita became an important place for making airplanes. They got tens of thousands of unemployed people from around the state to come work there.\nThe Women's Land Army of America (WLA) was a women's labor pool during World War II. It was organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It did not get many women from cities to do farm work. However, it did train hundreds of farm wives on how to handle machines, safety, proper clothing, time-saving methods, and nutrition.\nCold War era.\nKansas allowed segregation in public schools, and they were in Topeka and other cities. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court said in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that segregation was not protected by the United States Constitution.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, intercontinental ballistic missiles were kept in some Kansas buildings. They were stored to prepare for a possible attack. The buildings were closed in the 1980s.\nOn June 6, 1966, Topeka was hit by an F5 tornado. The \"1966 Topeka tornado\" started in southwest Topeka, moving northeast, hitting many buildings. The tornado caused $100 million in damage.\nSports.\nThe Kansas Sports Hall of Fame tells the history of sports in Kansas.\nCollege sports.\nThe first college football game played in Kansas was the 1890 Kansas vs. Baker football game in Baldwin City. Baker won 22\u20139. The first night football game west of the Mississippi River was played in Wichita, Kansas. The game was the 1905 between Cooper College (now called Sterling College) and Fairmount College (now Wichita State University). Also in 1905, Fairmount also played an experimental game against the Washburn Ichabods. This game was used to test new rules designed to make football safer.\nIn 1911, the Kansas Jayhawks went to play against the Missouri Tigers for the first homecoming game ever. The first college football homecoming game ever on television was played in Manhattan. It was between the Kansas State Wildcats and the Nebraska Cornhuskers.\nIn the 1951 season, the Southwestern head coach Harold Hunt got national recognition for rejecting a touchdown in a game against Central Missouri. Hunt told the officials that his player had stepped out of bounds. This would undo long touchdown run. Not a single one of the referees seen this happen, but they agreed to undo the touchdown. They put the ball back to the point where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later showed that Coach Hunt was correct.\nOn October 2, 1970, a plane crashed. The plane had about half of the football team for Wichita State. They were going to play a game against Utah State University. 31 people were killed. The game was canceled. The Utah State football team had a memorial service at the stadium where the game would have been played.\nProfessional sports.\nThe history of professional sports in Kansas starts from the creation of the Minor League Baseball Topeka Capitals and Leavenworth Soldiers in 1886 in the Western League. The African-American Bud Fowler played on the Topeka team that season. This was one year before the \"color line\" happened in professional baseball.\nThe first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930. It was between the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians and the Independence Producers. The Indians beat the Producers by 13 to 3 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association. 1,500 fans came to watch the game. The permanent lighting system was first used for an exhibition game on April 17, 1930. That game was between the Independence Producers and House of David semi-professional baseball team of Benton Harbor, Michigan. The Independence team won with a score of 9 to 1. 1,700 people watched."}

Lindsey stated that, \"There is no way I will get into this band on bass talent alone.\" The manager of the band videotaped her and requested that she play three songs. This happened twice, as the first time she broke her bass strap and did not successfully play the three songs and the band was unimpressed on the first attempt. On her second attempt, Steve Righ? the guitarist for the band had his back to her. Because this second attempt went so poorly, the manager requests that she try a third time. One of the songs played in this audition was the Mindless Self Indulgence song Tornado. While auditioning with this song, Lindsey took a film canister filled with out of her bra and proceeded to drink the shot. During the whole audition, Lindsey has matches stuck in her pigtails, she pulls these out of her pigtails immediately after taking the shot and strikes them on the stock on her bass. She blew out the liquor and lit it on fire, which gave her the appearance of blowing fire. Due to her lack of bass skills, this stunt is how she convinced the band into accepting her.

Tropical Depression 01W formed near the Marshall Islands, where a day later, it dissipated, but after crossing into the Philippine Sea, the depression regenerated into Tropical Depression Amang, and made landfall in the Samar region, where it soon dissipated, but floods from tropical depression Amang resulted in a million-peso damage and 10 deaths in Mindanao.\nFebruary was also active, with Tropical Depression 02W, which became Tropical Storm Wutip on February 19, and developed gradually in the Western Pacific, and became the season's first typhoon, and after an eyewall replacement cycle, it became the season's first Category 5 super typhoon, beating Typhoon Higos. After this, Wutip was attack by massive wind shear amounts, but managed to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility as Tropical Depression Betty before dissipating in the Philippine Sea, and many are debating on whether Wutip's immense power was normal as March was coming, or it was caused by the deadly climate change, which already took a toll on the world, humans and animals alike. Wutip spared landmasses, but the Micronesia Islands suffered minimal damages after Wutip passed there as a Category 3 typhoon.\nMarch was an inactive season, with only one tropical depression forming, Chedeng, which made landfall in Mindanao, before dissipating in the Sulu Sea, where wind shear was destructively high.\nApril and May.\nNo storms in April formed, but May had 4 tropical depressions were monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency, but were short lived and never intensified.\nJune and July.\nJune was inactive, starting off with a tropical depression on June 24, where it was named Tropical Depression Dodong by PAGASA, and intensified to become Tropical Storm Sepat after absorbing a nearby tropical depression in the South China Sea, but this storm was never recognized by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Sepat headed off to Japan, becoming an extratropical cyclone after. Tropical Depression 04W formed on June 27, where it was named Egay by PAGASA. Egay intensified into a tropical storm (only a tropical depression for the JMA and PAGASA) before weakening to a remnant low east of Taiwan.\nJuly was also fairly inactive, in which no typhoons formed. After Tropical Storm Egay dissipated, a new tropical depression in the South China Sea absorbed its remnants and became Tropical Storm Mun. Mun then made landfall in Hainan, where it caused minimal damages. In mid-July, Tropical Depression Falcon formed, becoming Tropical Storm Danas, which was confusing for many agencies, since it was battered by wind shear, and PAGASA announced that Danas (Falcon) looped over the landmass, while JMA and JTWC just announced the system was just stationary east of Cagayan. The blown off cloudiness split into 2 separate systems, but Danas re-absorbed the other one, while the one in the South China Sea intensified into Tropical Depression Goring, where it affected Taiwan and Batanes. Tropical Depression Goring's remnants was absorbed by a new system, where it became Tropical Storm Nari and headed for Japan.\nTropical Storm Wipha formed in the South China Sea, but only caused minimal damages in China.\nAugust.\nThe season finally pushed the kickstart in August, with a slowly-intensifying system, became Tropical Storm Francisco on August 1. The system gradually developed over a couple of days, until it became a typhoon, meanwhile Tropical Depression Hanna became Tropical Storm Lekima as Francisco made landfall in Kyushu and dissipated, and Lekima became the seasons'third typhoon, and rapidly intensified along with its slow movement over the Philippine Sea, and became the season's second super typhoon. Tropical Storm Krosa and a new tropical depression (would be later absorbed by Lekima) formed alongside Typhoon Lekima (2019), while it made landfall in China as the second costliest Chinese storm in history, while Krosa became an erratic storm as it made its way through Japan.\nBy mid-August, Tropical Depression Ineng became Tropical Storm Bailu, and continued to intensify into a severe tropical storm, enhancing the southwest monsoon, which caused a State of Calamity over Ilocos Norte and Php.1 billion damages there, and Bailu made landfall in Taiwan and China, causing more damages.\nTropical Depression Jenny became Tropical Storm Podul in late-August, and made most of its damages in Vietnam.\nSeptember.\n3 tropical depressions formed on the first day of September, the first was Tropical Depression Kabayan, which became Tropical Storm Kajiki, which was erratic, causing damages and flooding in Vietnam and the Philippines. The second was Tropical Depression Liwayway, which became Tropical Storm and later Typhoon Lingling, which was the strongest storm to make landfall in North Korea. The third was Typhoon Faxai, which was the strongest storm to strike Tokyo in 60 years.\nIn mid-September, Tropical Depression Marilyn interacted with a nearby tropical depression and tropical storm Peipah, which sended it back into the Philippine Sea, but was renamed Nimfa, and Nimfa intensified into Tropical Storm Tapah, and later became a typhoon before Japan landfall. Behind Tapah was Typhoon Mitag, which became a Category 2 and struck the same areas as Tapah.\nOctober.\nTropical Depression 20W formed on October 5, 2019 in the outer Western Pacific, and later intensified into Tropical Storm Hagibis. Hagibis later became a typhoon, as it rapidly intensified towards the Mariana Islands and Guam. On 7 October, while continuing to move west, Hagibis explosively intensified and became a super typhoon in the space of only a few hours, developing a pinhole eye. As it approached the uninhabited areas of the Mariana Islands, strong convective activity as a result of extremely favourable conditions saw Hagibis became a very powerful Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute sustained wind speeds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). The National Weather Service also began issuing advisories for its areas of responsibility, with a typhoon warning issued for Garapan and Tinian, and tropical storm advisories issued for Sinapalo and Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a. Hagibis passed over the Mariana Islands at 15:30 UTC on 7 October at peak intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 915 hPa (27.02 inHg). After passing the Mariana Islands Hagibis underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, thus weakening the typhoon. On October 12, Hagibis made landfall on Japan with sustained wind speeds of 150\u00a0km/h. Many competitions had to be cancelled due to the storm, including a Formula 1 qualifying match. Flooding in Japan was serious, and the storm costed 15 billion US dollars.\nThree other tropical cyclones formed in October: one called Neoguri which struck the southern parts of Japan; another one called Bualoi mostly was on ocean and did not make landfall, and Matmo, which made landfall on Vietnam and brought heavy rainfall to southeast Asia. The remnants of it developed into an Indian Ocean cyclone known as Bulbul.\nNovember.\nIn the month of November, six named storms were recorded, including the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, Halong, formed on November 1 and became to intensify as a Category 5 super typhoon four days later with 10-minutes sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) and with a minimum pressure of 905 millibars. In late-November, another storm formed that was named Kammuri on November 24. Kammuri became intensified as a Category 4 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, Kammuri made landfall in Philippines on November 30 confirming twelve people who died from the storm, with $116 million in damage.\nDecember.\nThe month of December had a quiet activity, after Kammuri's landing in Philippines, the arrival of the last named storm of the season, Phanfone, formed on December 19. Phanfone made landfall in the Philippines on December 25 during Christmas Eve as a Category 2 typhoon, the first time since Nock-Ten in 2016. Phanfone dissipated on December 29 after making landfall in Philippines, leaving a total of 50 deaths and with $61.7 million in damages.\nAltogether, the season was an above-average season with 29 named storms, and the costliest season on record.\nStorm names.\nWithin the Northwest Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo\u00a0\u2014 Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of . PAGASA names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N and 25\u00b0N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee. Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season. Unused names are marked in .\nInternational names.\nA tropical cyclone is named when it is judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of . The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. Retired names, if any, will be announced by the WMO in 2020, though replacement names will be announced in 2021. The next 28\u00a0names on the naming list are listed here along with their international numeric designation, if they are used. During the season, the name Mun was used for the first time, after it replaced the name Fitow, which was retired after the 2013 season.\nPhilippines.\nThis season, PAGASA will use its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones that either develop within or move into their self-defined area of responsibility. The names were taken from a list of names last used during 2015 and are scheduled to be used again during 2023. All of the names are the same except Liwayway and Nimfa, replacing the names Lando and Nona after these were retired.\nSeason effects.\nThis table summarizes all the systems that developed within or moved into the North Pacific Ocean, to the west of the International Date Line during 2019. The tables also provide a brief summary of a systems intensity, duration, land areas affected and any deaths or damages associated with the system."}

{"id": "700344", "revid": "1061539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=700344", "title": "St. Mary's Food Bank", "text": "St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance is a nonprofit, nonsectarian organization in Phoenix, Arizona. Founded in 1967 by John van Hengel, St. Mary's was the first modern organization to operate using the food bank model, which spread throughout the U.S and the rest of the world. Today, St. Mary's is recognized as the world's first food bank.\nSince its creation, St. Mary's has expanded its operations to 9 of Arizona's 15 counties, distributing millions of pounds of food to the hungry each year. St. Mary's also operates its own food pantry, allowing people to get food directly from the warehouse. The organization additionally offers specialized programs apart from food banking, including after-school programs for children and career training for adults.\nSt. Mary's is a member of Feeding America, a network of hunger-relief organizations also founded by van Hengel with the purpose of providing food to people across the country.\nFoundation and History.\nPrior to founding St. Mary's Food Bank, John van Hengel lived in Phoenix and volunteered at St. Vincent de Paul Soup Kitchen. Van Hengel spent much of his time collecting food to supply the soup kitchen and donating the surplus to the homeless throughout the city. Eventually, he was introduced to a struggling mother of 10 who used the food thrown out by grocery stores to feed her children. She expressed her desire for a place where unwanted food could be collected and given to the hungry, much like a bank collects and distributes money. After searching through dumpsters and noting that much of the discarded food was still edible, van Hengel decided to establish a \"food bank\" where unwanted food would be gathered in large quantities. St. Mary's Basilica of Phoenix loaned van Hengel $3,000 and provided him with an abandoned bakery to operate out of. With that, St. Mary's Food Bank was founded in 1967 and named after the basilica in honor of their contribution. \nSt. Mary's began operating by developing partnerships with grocery stores, food producers, and social welfare organizations throughout Phoenix. By acting as a clearinghouse for these partner organizations, St. Mary's distributed over 250,000 pounds of food in its first year. That number increased to \"about a million pounds of food\" by the end of 1968, according to van Hengel. With limited financial resources, St. Mary's relied heavily on volunteers to operate, and focused on obtaining food rather than monetary donations. Guided by the motto \"the poor we shall always have with us, but why the hungry?,\" St. Mary's continued to attract more volunteers and partner agencies to its mission, allowing the food bank to expand its reach through Phoenix and other parts of Arizona.\nBy 1975, the concept of food banking had gained popularity in other parts of the United States. Van Hengel was offered a federal grant to help spread the food banking concept across the country and left St. Mary's to form the organization known today as Feeding America. He returned to St. Mary's in 1982, while also working as a consultant for new food bank operations as the concept spread worldwide. \nSt. Mary's continued operating in Arizona using the same model that was being adopted by organizations across the world. Today, St. Mary's is able to collect and distribute meals to more than 600 agencies statewide. The organization estimates that it will provide over 90 million meals to Arizonans in 2019, with the goal of providing 100 million meals to those in need by 2021.\nPrograms.\nFood Distribution.\nSt. Mary's has over 600 partner agencies in 9 different Arizona counties, including homeless shelters, food pantries, and dining halls. St. Mary's still operates using the traditional \"warehouse\" model of food banking, supplying their partner agencies with donated food.\nIn addition to assuming the role of a traditional food bank, St. Mary's also runs its own food pantry, allowing people to get food directly from their warehouses. St. Mary's frequently offers \"mobile\" food pantries \u2014 semi trucks filled with food products \u2014 in various locations throughout Arizona. These mobile pantries normally run on regular schedules, but they have also been dispatched for special occasions. During the 2018\u201319 United States federal government shutdown, for example, St. Mary's held a mobile food pantry to provide food for local TSA employees who were working without pay.\nPartnerships and Support.\nThrough their Hunger Heroes program, St. Mary's has partnered with a wide variety of local and global companies who donate food, funding, and volunteers to the food bank. According to St. Mary's, it costs one dollar to provide seven meals for a single person, making fundraising a powerful tool in providing assistance to the hungry. \nCompanies and organizations that have partnered with St. Mary's include:\nMany of St. Mary's partners also participate in special campaigns. The annual \"Fight Hunger. Spark Change\" is one such campaign, where Walmart Inc. employees work with local volunteers to distribute meals from mobile food pantries across the state. Additionally, Walmart and Sam's Club donate a predetermined amount of money to St. Mary's when customers buy select items in stores. In the 2018 campaign, St. Mary's received enough money to distribute 1.67 million meals across Arizona.\nChildren's Feeding Programs.\nRoughly one in four children in Arizona struggle with hunger; the state is currently ranked the fifth-highest state in the U.S for food insecurity. To combat this, St. Mary's has created programs to provide nutritious meals for children. \nThe Kids Cafe\u00ae is an after-school program where children can receive free meals while engaged in tutoring or recreational activities. This program provides roughly 6,000 meals daily to over 130 locations in Arizona. The program is also available during the summer, when children don't have access to the free meals they might receive at school.\nThe Backpack Program partners with schools and community centers to distribute bags packed with a weekend's supply of food. These bags are given to children once a week with the goal of helping their entire family \u2013 as such, each bag contains enough food to supply three meals to a family of four. St. Mary's partners with over 100 schools and community centers to distribute 3,000 backpacks per week.\nCommunity Kitchen.\nThe Community Kitchen is a 12-week course where adults learn to work in the food-service industry while also developing career and professional skills. The program is intended to help those with barriers to employment develop the skills to become more self-sufficient, providing them with job placement support upon completing the course.\nArizona Charitable Tax Credit.\nSt. Mary's Food Bank Alliance is classified as a \"Qualifying Charitable Organization\" by the Arizona Department of Revenue, meaning that residents can receive a tax credit for donations up to $800.\nCommunity Involvement.\nSt. Mary's depends on involvement from people within the community to continue operating. Some of the ways that people have gotten involved include:"}

She is known for her work against climate change, a popular example of youth activism. She started protesting on 20 August 2018, outside of the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm. In December 2018, she attended the UN Climate Change Conference. In the next month, she gave a speech on the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nShe has received many awards. Three Norwegian MPs nominated her for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. \nOn 15 March 2019, approximately 1,400,000 people around the world, mainly students, protested against climate change. On 24 May 2019, a second major protest took place.\nIn December 2019, \"Time\" magazine named Thunberg \"Time\" Person of the Year 2019.\nEarly life.\nGreta Thunberg was born on 3 January 2003. She is the oldest daughter of Malena Ernman, an opera singer and actor Svante Thunberg. Her grandfather is actor and director Olof Thunberg.\nAt a TEDx speech in November 2018, Thunberg stated that she first heard about climate change at the age of eight, but could not understand why so little was being done about it. At age 11, she had depression and stopped talking. Later, she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), and selective mutism. She added that selective mutism means that she was speaking only when she needed to and that \"now is one of those moments\". She further added that the \"spectrum\" was an advantage \"as almost everything is black or white\". She said: \"I feel like I am dying inside if I don't protest\". She hands out leaflets outside the Swedish parliament with the phrase \"I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.\"\nHer father doesn't like that she misses school but says: \"[We] respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest, and be happy\". To lower her family's carbon footprint, she insisted on becoming vegan and give up flying. She said she persuaded her parents to give up eating meat by making them feel guilty. \"I kept telling them that they were stealing our future.\" Her mother gave up her international career as an opera singer. Despite invitations to speak at international events, Greta also avoids flying.\nThunberg says her teachers are divided in their views about her missing class to make her protest. She says: \"As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop.\" A teacher who supports her said: \"Greta is a troublemaker, she is not listening to adults. But we are heading full speed for a catastrophe, and in this situation the only reasonable thing is to be unreasonable.\"\nWorks.\nIn May 2019 Penguin, a British publishing house, published \"No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference\", which is a collection of her speeches. Penguin published \"Scenes from the Heart\", the Thunberg family's story, in August 2018. All earnings from these books will be donated to charity. In the same month, artist Jody Thomas painted a mural of Thunberg on a wall in Bristol. It portrays the bottom half of her face as if under rising sea water."}

It was first known as RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. RKO was an acronym for Radio-Keith-Orpheum, the original parent company of RKO Radio Pictures. It was one of the Big Five studios of Hollywood's Golden Age. The company was made by the merger of the Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) theater chain and the Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) studio in October 1928. It was put together by David Sarnoff of RCA. His goal was to create a market for RCA's photophone, which was their sound-on-film technology. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor Floyd Odlum.\nRKO is well known for the musicals it made in the 1930s. These starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Other well-known actors got their start at RKO. Among these were Katharine Hepburn, Robert Mitchum, and Cary Grant. Many praise RKO's work on film noir. Val Lewton's low-budget horror movies are also praised by movie critics. RKO made two of the most famous movies in history. These are \"King Kong\" and \"Citizen Kane\". They also made movies with other studios. These include the well known \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Notorious\". RKO also took care of sales for movies made by Walt Disney from 1937 to the mid-1950s. The also took care of sales for Samuel Goldwyn.\nIn 1948, Howard Hughes took over RKO and this lead to a time of decline. Then in 1955, it was bought by the General Tire and Rubber Company. RKO stopped making new movies in 1957, and mostly shut down two years later. In 1959, the assets of RKO moved to a new company called RKO General. In 1981, RKO was revived under the name RKO Pictures Inc. In 1989, it was sold to new owners. They run it using the name RKO Pictures LLC."}

The word 'sail' is by analogy with boats which use a sail to use wind to move. The concept was first proposed in the 17th century by Johannes Kepler. He had a theory that sails could be adapted to \"heavenly breezes\".\nIn 1865, James Clerk Maxwell published his theory of electromagnetic fields and radiation. He showed that light (one form of electromagnetic radiation) can put pressure on an object. This pressure is called radiation pressure. This provided a foundation for the science behind the solar sail. \nSolar radiation exerts a pressure on the sail due to reflection and a small fraction that is absorbed.\nSolar pressure acts on spacecraft, in space or in orbit around a planet. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, is displaced thousands of kilometers by solar pressure. The effects are predicted in planning. This has been done since the time of the early interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the orientation of a craft, a factor that is included in spacecraft design.\nThe concept of solar sail was later used science fiction, such as the works of Jules Verne. \nThe theory.\nThe idea of a solar sail is to use radiation pressure from the Sun to move a spacecraft, probably using large \"mirrors\" (large light reflective surfaces). The disadvantage of the method is that the generated thrust is very small. The benefit is that no propellant is needed (as long as there is light). As a result, it is considered a possible option for future spacecraft. To date, only small test versions have been used as experiments. \nThe total force exerted on an 800 by 800 meter solar sail, for example, is about at Earth's distance from the Sun, making it a low-thrust propulsion system, similar to spacecraft propelled by electric engines. As it uses no propellant, the force is exerted almost constantly. The collective effect over time is great enough to be considered a way of propelling spacecraft.\nHistory.\nPlans for the first use of the concept were made in the 1970s by Bruce Murray and Louis Friedman, two researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \nOn May 21, 2010, Japan's Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) successfully launched the solar sail, the IKAROS (Interplanetary Kite-Craft Accelerated by Radiation Of The Sun). It used a solar sail in space between Earth and Venus. This was the first successful use of a solar sail.\nIn 2010, NASA launched the solar sail craft NANOSEL-D2. The was the first success of NASA's solar sail craft.\nOn 2 July 2019 the Planet Society, based in the United States, launched the LightSail 2 satellite, designed using solar sail technology. The lightweight satellite, was launched with the SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This was low budget mission funded by donations from 50,000 members. The total budget was less than 7 million USD. In late July 2019, LightSail 2 opened its solar sail. It took about 3 minutes to do so. "}

The goal is to improve intercultural relations, cultural diplomacy, and intercultural competence between people from the United States and other countries by exchanging of people, knowledge, and skills. It is one of the most prestigious and fellowship programs in the world. It is also very difficult to receive a grant. American citizens including students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists and artists may receive scholarships or grants to study, do research, teach, or exercise their talents abroad. Citizens of other countries may do the same in the United States of America. The program was started by United States Senator J. William Fulbright in 1946 and is one of the most widely recognized and prestigious scholarships in the world. The program provides 8,000 grants annually.\nThe Fulbright Program is administered by cooperating organizations such as the Institute of International Education. It is in over 160 countries around the world. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State sponsors the Fulbright Program and gets funding from the United States Congress from annual appropriation bills. Additional direct and in-kind support comes from partner governments, foundations, corporations, and host institutions both in and outside the U.S. In 49 countries, a bi-national Fulbright Commission administers and oversees the Fulbright Program. In countries without a Fulbright Commission but that have an active program, the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy manages the Fulbright Program. More than 370,000 people have participated in the program since it began; 59 Fulbright alumni have won Nobel Prizes; 82 have won Pulitzer Prizes.\nHistory.\nIn 1945, Senator J. William Fulbright proposed a bill to use the profits from selling surplus U.S. government war property to fund international exchange between the U.S. and other countries. The timing after the Second War was important. Alongside the United Nations, the Fulbright Program was an attempt to promote peace and understanding through educational exchange. The bill had a plan to forgive the debts foreign countries piled up during the war and in return for funding an international educational program. This program was planned to be an essential vehicle to promote peace and mutual understanding between individuals, institutions and future leaders anywhere in the world.\nOn August 1, 1946, President Harry S. Truman signed the bill into law, and Congress created the Fulbright Program in what became the largest education exchange program in history.\nSince it began, the program has operated on a bi-nationally. Each country in the Fulbright Program has an agreement with the U.S. government. The first countries to sign agreements were China in 1947 and Burma, the Philippines, and Greece in 1948.\nProgram.\nThe Fulbright Program works two ways: U.S. citizens may receive funding to go to a foreign country (U.S. Student Program, U.S. Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, etc.) and non-U.S. citizens may come to the U.S. (Foreign Student Program, Visiting Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, etc.).\nCandidates recommended for Fulbright grants should have high academic achievement, a strong project proposal or statement of purpose, demonstrated leadership potential, and flexibility and adaptability to work successfully with the host community abroad.\nFulbright grants are offered in almost all academic disciplines except clinical medical research with patient contact.\nNotable alumni.\nFulbright alumni have occupied key roles in government, academia, and industry.

It probably came from the personal name \"Uta\". The Slavic Obotrites tribe settled eastern Holstein in the 7th/8th centuries A.D. and built a castle on Pheasant Island in the lake now called the Gro\u00dfer Eutiner See.\nDutch settlers came to live in \"Utin\" in the twelfth century. In 1156 Eutin became a market town. It later became the seat of the Prince-Bishopric of L\u00fcbeck because L\u00fcbeck itself was an imperial free city. When the bishopric was secularized in 1803, Eutin became part of the Duchy of Oldenburg. In the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, Eutin passed from the Free State of Oldenburg to the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. After World War II, it became part of the modern Bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein.\nCulture.\nEutin is birthplace of composer Carl Maria von Weber. To honor him, an open-air theater (') was built in the park of Eutin Castle in 1951. Operas are performed there in July and August during the Eutin Opera Summer Festival ('). The seating capacity of this open-air venue is about 2000. The festival includes music students in Eutin aand students from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, US. Lawrence is a twin city with Eutin. \nEutin has an annual Blues Festival (Bluesfest Eutin) at the beginning of summer. Local musicians, as well as up and coming blues artists from around the world, come to play at this three-day outdoor blues festival. The festival is in the market place in the center of town. Admission is free.\nGeography and economy.\nEutin is surrounded by lakes of the Holsteinische Schweiz, including the Gro\u00dfer Eutiner See, Kleiner Eutiner See, Kellersee and Ukleisee. There are forests around the lakes. Popular activities on these lakes include boating, canoeing, rowing, swimming, and fishing.\nSchleswig-Holstein, particularly Eutin, has many rapeseed fields.

The series was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck. The series narrates Chernobyl nuclear disaster of April 1986 and the cleanup efforts that followed. It features an cast led by Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Emily Watson, and Paul Ritter. The series premiered in the United States and the United Kingdom on May 6\u20137, 2019. It received mostly positive reviews.\nPremise.\n\"Chernobyl\" dramatizes the story of the nuclear plant disaster which occurred in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Soviet Union), showing the stories of the people who caused the disaster and those who responded to it. The series depicts some of the least known stories of the disaster, including the efforts of the firefighters who were the first responders on the scene, volunteers, and teams of miners tasked with digging a critical tunnel.\nThe miniseries is based in large part on the memories of Pripyat locals, as told by Belarusian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich in her book \"Voices from Chernobyl\".\nProduction.\nDevelopment and writing.\nWriter Craig Mazin began researching for the project in 2014, by reading books and government reports from inside and outside of the Soviet Union. Mazin also interviewed nuclear scientists to learn how a reactor works, and former Soviet citizens to gain a better idea of the culture in 1986. Furthermore, Mazin read several first-person accounts in order to bring additional authenticity to the story. He explained, \"When you're reading the personal stories of people who were there\u00a0\u2014\u200apeople who lived near the plant, people who worked at the plant, people who were sent to Chernobyl as part of the effort to clean it up\u00a0\u2014\u200ain those individual accounts, that's really where the story came alive\".\nIn preparation for the miniseries, Mazin visited the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Mazin also did not cast any American actors, as that could potentially pull the audience out of the story.\nOn July 26, 2017, it was announced that HBO and Sky will produce a series named \"Chernobyl\". It was HBO's first co-production with Sky UK. The five-episode miniseries was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck. Mazin was the executive producer together with Carolyn Strauss and Jane Featherstone. Chris Fry and Renck acted as co-executive producers. On March 11, 2019, it was announced that the miniseries would premiere on May 6, 2019. On June 4, 2019, Craig Mazin made the original scripts of all episodes available for downloading in PDF format (see External links below).\nCasting.\nSimultaneously with the initial series announcement, it was confirmed that Jared Harris would star in the series. On March 19, 2018, it was announced that Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Emily Watson had joined the main cast. In May 2018, it was announced that Paul Ritter, Jessie Buckley, Adrian Rawlins, and Con O'Neill also joined the cast.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography began in April 2018 in Lithuania. Initial filming started on May 13, 2018. The majority of the filmings took place in Fabijoni\u0161k\u0117s, a residential district in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Fabijoniskes has maintained an authentic Soviet atmosphere. Accordingly, it was used to portray the Ukrainian city of Pripyat. An area of densely built panel housing apartments served as a location for the evacuation scenes. Director Johan Renck heavily criticised the amount of diverse and eye-catching modern windows in the houses, but was not concerned about removing them in post-production. At the end of March, production moved to Visaginas, Lithuania, to shoot the exterior and interior of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, a decommissioned nuclear power station, also known as \"Chernobyl's sister\" due to its visual resemblance and the nuclear reactor design used at both Chernobyl and Ignalina (RBMK nuclear power reactor). In early June 2018, production moved to Ukraine to shoot minor final scenes. The filming of \"Chernobyl\" took 16 weeks."}

Some of these showers aren't caused by post-monsoon rainfall but due to western disturbances.\nThe primary temperature, rainfall and wind features of the three Distinct Seasons of Uttar Pradesh can be summarised as below:\nBecause there are significant climatic differences, Uttar Pradesh has been divided into two meteorological sub-divisions \u2013 U.P. East and U.P. West.\nGeographical terrain.\nThe state of Uttar Pradesh is in the heart of Indo-Gangetic Plain with River Ganges passing through Uttar Pradesh.\nTemperature.\nThe extreme temperatures vary from 0 to 46\u00a0\u00b0C. High temperatures, approximating 50\u00a0\u00b0C have been recorded in Gonda district. A such wide range of temperature fluctuations in most parts of the state can lead to either cold or heat waves, both resulting in substantial loss of lifes and economy.\nHeat waves.\nIn 2007, Banda district recorded daily temperatures close to 45.5\u00a0\u00b0C for several days. At least 62 people died during the heat wave that year. In June 2009, another 30 people during a heat wave in Uttar Pradesh. Highest temperatures reached 49\u00a0\u00b0C in Bundelkhand district of northern Uttar Pradesh. In June 2010, Jhansi recorded the highest temperature of 46.7\u00a0\u00b0C, the hottest for U.P. for that year.\nCold waves.\nIn recent years, winters at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008 caused an increase of cold-wave related deaths in U.P. with temperatures dipping to 2.8\u00a0\u00b0C in the city of Meerut. Simultaneously it also led to a loss of crops and agricultural produce. Similarly, in 2009, the temperature dropped up to 2.9\u00a0\u00b0C in Meerut, causing deaths. On late 2010 and early 2011, this winter also caused cold-wave related deaths. This time, Churk town in Sonabhadra district recorded the lowest temperature, at 1.4\u00a0\u00b0C. On 13 January 2013, Kanpur recorded its all-time low temperature when the temperature reached \u22121.1\u2103. In Agra, the temperature reached\u22120.7\u2103.\nPrecipitation.\nUttar Pradesh has a uniform rain pattern. Snowfall doesn't occur but hailstorms are common for Uttar Pradesh. The type of rainfall that Uttar Pradesh receives is orographic, cyclonic and convectional.\nRain.\nPrimarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Monsoon brings the most monsoonal rainfall in Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is affected primarily from the southwest monsoon. \"Western disturbances\" and North-East Monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall rainfall of the state. The rain in Uttar Pradesh can vary from an annual average of 1.700\u00a0mm in hilly areas to 840\u00a0mm in Uttar Pradesh. As a direct result of the monsoonal rainfall, excess rain can lead to floods and shortage to droughts. As such, these two phenomenons of floods and droughts are common in the state.\nFloods in U.P..\nFloods are a known hazard of U.P. due to overflowing of its main rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Ramganga, Gomti, Sharda, Ghaghra, Rapti and Gandak. The estimated annual losses due to floods in U.P. reach . Major flood management efforts have been tried to mitigate the risk. Most of these floods occur due to the Monsoon rains and overflowing of rivers during the rainy periods. Year 2010 witnessed one such year of flooding in U.P.\nDroughts in Uttar Pradesh.\nShortage of rain during the highly variable Monsoon season can cause droughts in U.P. leading to several deaths and loss of property. The recent 2002 and 2004 drought-related financial estimates report financial losses of and respectively. The recurrence of a major deficiency in annual rainfall follows a 6\u20138 years cycle in Eastern U.P. whereas in Western U.P., follows a 10 year cycle.\nWind.\nIn summers, hot winds called \"loo\" blow all across U.P. They are carrying dust and cause significant damage. In winters, dry and rainless winds blow across the state. Fog may also form in parts of U.P."}

The words and pronunciations of Bombay Hindi are derived mainly from Hindi and Urdu, collectively known as Hindi-Urdu or Hindustani. In addition, the predominant substratum influence on Bombay is Marathi. Marathi is the official and majority language of Maharashtra. Bombay Hindi also incorporates words from Gujarati and Konkani.\nGeneral.\nUnlike the most local dialects which are used primarily in the metropolitan centres, Bombay Hindi is widely known throughout India, as a result of its frequent use in Bollywood movies. Initially, this dialect was used to represent crooks and uncouth characters. According to Shoma A. Chatterji, \"Indian films have the unique quality of different characters speaking different varieties of Hindi according to their social status, their caste, communal identity, education, profession, financial status, etc. [...] The villain's goons, speak in a special vulgarised, Bambaiya Hindi concocted specifically to typify such screen characters in Hindi cinema.\". A particular genre of movies, named Munnabhai, in which the lead characters - being members of the Mumbai criminal underworld - speak entirely in this dialect, helped to spread the dialect.\nDespite this increase in popularity, there are people who criticize the use of this dialect. Sometimes, Mumbaiya are seen as being disrespectful and demeaning.\nSome neologisms which originated in Bambaiya Hindi have spread throughout India. Some examples are the words bindaas (a compound word, constituted from the Marathi words Bin and Dhast = Without Fear. Bindaas means 'relaxed' and this word was incorporated into the Oxford English Dictionary in 2005) and Gandhigiri (invented in the movie \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\", a portmanteau of Gandhi and \"-giri\", which is similar to the English 'ism' (as in Gandhi-ism), though slightly more informal).\nThanks to Bollywood, some Marathi words, such as Thaska, Wakda, Porgi, Navri, Navrai, Kombdi, and Mulga/Mulgi, have been incorporated in Hindi vocabulary. Many Hindi songs have some Marathi words added."}

It is the basis of the Bengali, Assamese alphabet and Tirhuta (a mix of Devanagari and Eastern Nagari). It is also used to write Meitei (Manipuri), Kokborok (Tripuri) and Bishnupriya Manipuri. Other languages, such as Angika, Bodo, Karbi, Maithili and Mising, were formerly written in Bengali\u2013Assamese script. Modern Sylheti uses the alphabet, alongside Sylheti Nagari. It was originally used to write Sanskrit. Today, in Eastern India, the use of Eastern Nagari for Sanskrit continues.\nDescription.\nThe Bengali\u2014Asamese script wasn't created to write a certain language, but it was the main script in the eastern regions of Medieval India. The script was also used to write Sanskrit. In this region, Hindu epics (Mahabharata, Ramayana etc.) were written in older versions of the Eastern Nagari script in this region. After the medieval period, Pali succeeded Sanskrit as the new written language in the region. The vernacular dialects of Pali eventually evolved into Bengali, Assamese and other related languages. Sankardev used the script in the 15th and 16th centuries to compose his writings in Assamese. Madhava Kandali used it to write the Assamese Ramayana in the 14th century. It was also used by the later Ahom kings to write the Buranjis, the Ahom chronicles, in the Assamese language. There is a rich legacy of Eastern Indian literature written in this script, which is still occasionally used to write Sanskrit today.\nLike Devanagari, Eastern Nagari also uses dozens of consonant clusters. They are represented by different and sometimes quite irregular characters. Thus, learning to read the script is complicated by the large size of the full set of characters and character combinations, numbering about 500. While efforts at standardizing the script for the Bengali language continue in such notable centers as the Bangla Academy in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi in Kolkata (West Bengal, India), there isn't a uniform spelling for Bengali, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Bengali and Assamese variations exist today in the formalized system.\nIt seems that the need to typeset Eastern Nagari on computers will influence greatly its standardization. Since around 2001, there is work to develop Unicode fonts, and it seems likely that it will split into two variants, traditional and modern.\nScript.\nIn this and other articles on Wikipedia dealing with the Assamese and Bengali languages, a Romanization scheme used by linguists specializing in Assamese and Bengali phonology is included along with IPA transcription.\nVowels.\nThe script presently has 11 vowel letters, used to represent the seven vowel sounds of Bengali and eight vowel sounds of Assamese, along with a number of vowel diphthongs. All of these vowel letters are used in both Assamese and Bengali. Some of the vowels have different sounds depending on the word. There's a number of vowel distinctions who are preserved in the writing system but they are not pronounced as such in modern spoken Bengali or Assamese. For example, the script has two letters for the vowel sound [i] and two letters for the vowel sound [u]. This difference arised from the time when Eastern Nagari was used to write Sanskrit, a language that had a short and a long , and a short and a long . These letters are preserved in the script with their traditional names of \"short i\" and \"long i\", etc., despite that they are no longer pronounced differently in ordinary speech.\nTwo additional modified Vowels, and , are not considered letters of the Eastern Nagari script, but are often used in Assamese and Bengali (respectively) to represent certain vowels when the intended pronunciation would otherwise be ambiguous. The latter vowel, which is used in Bengali, is used frequently to transcript texts originally written in other alphabets, most notably Latin. \nVowel signs can be used in conjunction with consonants to modify the consonant's pronunciation (e.g. , k\u00f4). When there isn't a vowel diacritic symbol, the vowel \"\" (\u00f4) is the default vowel for the consonant. For example, under this rule, the letter \u099a is pronounced cho. To note the absence of a vowel, a \"h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4\" (\u09cd) may be written underneath the consonant, e.g. \u09a6\u09cd d. \nConsonants.\nThe names of the consonant letters in Eastern Nagari are typically just the consonant's main pronunciation plus the inherent vowel \"\" \"\u00f4\". Since the inherent vowel is not written, most letters' names look identical to the letter itself (e.g. the name of the letter \"\" is itself \"gh\u00f4\", not \"gh\"). Some letters that have lost their distinctive pronunciation in Modern Assamese and Bengali are having the same pronunciation with other letters. For example, since the consonant phoneme /n/ is represented by the consonants , , or (depending on the spelling of the particular word). These letters aren't called simply \"n\u00f4\". Instead, they are called \"dental n\u00f4\", \"cerebral n\u00f4\" and \"ni\u00f4\". Similarly, the phoneme in Bengali and in Assamese can be written as \"palatal sh\u00f4/xh\u00f4\" , \"cerebral sh\u00f4/xh\u00f4\" , or \"dental s\u00f4/x\u00f4\" , depending on the word.\nDigits.\nEastern Nagari script has its own set of digits.

It existed as a republic from 1925 to 1991. Initially, on 7 August 1921, it was established as the Turkmen Oblast of the Turkestan ASSR before being made. On 13 May 1925, Turkmen ASSR was promoted to a union republic of the USSR as the Turkmen SSR.\nSince then, the borders of Turkmenia are unchanged. On 22 August 1990, Turkmenia declared its state sovereignty, who means that its laws have a priority over the Soviet laws. On 27 October 1991, it declared its independence and Turkmen SSR was renamed to Turkmenistan.\nGeographically, Turkmenia bordered Iran and Afghanistan to the south, Kazakhstan to the north and Uzbekistan to the east. Additionally, Turkmenia was a landlocked country; however it had access to the Caspian Sea in the west. \nHistory.\nAnnexation to Russia.\nRussian attempts to annex Turkmen territory began in the second half of nineteenth century. Of all the Central Asian peoples, the Turkmen had the hardest resistance against the Russian expansion. In 1869, the Russian Empire established its presence in present-day Turkmenistan, creating a new sea port named Krasnovodsk (now T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy). \nA few years later, they annexed Khiva Khanate in 1873. Because Turkmen tribes, most notably the Yomud, were in the military service of the Khivan khan, Russian forces invaded Khorazm, destroying many settlements and killing hundreds of Turkmens. In 1881, the Russians under General Mikhail Skobelev besieged and captured Geok Tepe, one of the last Turkmen strongholds. Geok Tepe is located close to Ashgabat. After the Turkmen defeat, the annexation of the present-day Turkmenistan was met with only weak resistance. Later in the same year, the Russians signed an agreement with the Persians. This agreement established the pernament Russian-Persian border, which became the present-day border between Turkmenistan and Iran. In 1897 a border agreement was signed between the Russians and Afghans.\nFollowing annexation to Russia, the area was administered as the Transcaspian Region. Transcaspian Region was administered by officials appointed from the Turkestan Governor-Generalship in Tashkent. In the 1880s, a railroad was built from Krasnovodsk to Ashgabat and later extended to Tashkent. Urban areas began to develop along the railway. Although the Transcaspian Region essentially was a colony of Russia, the Russians still had concerns, such as the British colonialist intentions in the region and with possible uprisings by the Turkmen.\nCreation of an SSR.\nBecause the Turkmen generally didn't oppose the introduction of Soviet rule in 1917, little revolutionary activity occurred in the region in the years that followed. However, the years immediately before the revolution had been marked by sporadic Turkmen uprisings against Russian rule, most prominently the anti-tsarist revolt of 1916 that expanded through the whole of Turkestan. Their armed resistance to Soviet rule was part of the larger Basmachi Revolt throughout Central Asia from the 1920s into the early 1930s, which included most of the future USSR republics. Although Soviet sources describe this struggle as a minor chapter in the republic's history, it is clear that opposition was important and resulted in the death of large numbers of Turkmens.\nIn October 1924 Central Asia was divided into distinct political entities. The Transcaspian Region and Turkmen Oblast of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR) became the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR), a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, having equal status with e.g. Russian SFSR. During the forced collectivization and other extreme socioeconomic changes of the first decades of Soviet rule, pastoral nomadism ceased to be an economic alternative in Turkmenistan, and by the late 1930s the majority of Turkmen had become sedentary. Efforts by the Soviet state to undermine the traditional Turkmen lifestyle resulted in significant changes in familial and political relationships, religious and cultural observances, and intellectual developments. Thousands of Russians and other Slavs, as well people of various nationalities mainly from the Caucasus, migrated to urban areas of Turkmenia. Turkmenia was industrialized and natural resources were exploited in a limited degree.\nUnder Soviet rule, all religious beliefs were suppressed by the communist authorities as superstition and \"vestiges of the past\". Most religious education and religious observances were banned. The vast majority of mosques were closed. An official Muslim Board of Central Asia based in Tashkent was established during World War II to supervise the Islamic faith in Central Asia. For the most of its existion, the Muslim Board functioned mostly as an instrument of propaganda. Atheism affected religious development and contributed to the isolation of the Turkmen people from the international Muslim community. Some religious customs, such as Muslim burial and male circumcision, continued to be practiced throughout the Soviet period, but most religious belief, knowledge, and customs were preserved only in rural areas in \"folk form\" as a kind of unofficial Islam unsanctioned by the state-run Spiritual Directorate.\nPre-independence.\nBeginning in the 1930s, Moscow kept the republic under strict control. The nationalities policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) led to a development of a Turkmen political elite and promoted Russification. Slavs, both in Moscow and Turkmenia, closely supervised the national cadre of government officials and bureaucrats. Generally, Turkmen politicians supported Soviet policies. Moscow initiated nearly all political activity in the republic. Turkmenistan was a largely quiet Soviet republic. The only major poltiical event was a corruption scandal in the mid-1980s that ousted longtime First Secretary Muhammetnazar Gapurow. Many Turkmens were self-dependent, contributing to the low impact of Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika on Turkmenistan. The republic found itself rather unprepared for the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence that followed in 1991.\nWhen other Soviet republics claimed sovereignty over their territory in 1988 and 1989, Turkmenia's leadership also began to criticize Moscow's economic and political policies. After an unanimous vote of its Supreme Soviet, Turkmenistan declared its sovereignty in August 1990. In August 1991, following the failed coup attempt against Gorbachev's rule in Moscow, Turkmenia's communist leader and first president of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov called for a popular referendum on independence. The official result of the referendum was 94 percent in favor of independence. The republic's Supreme Soviet declared Turkmenistan's independence on October 27, 1991. Turkmenistan gained formal independence from the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991.\nPolitics.\nAs with the other Soviet republics, Turkmenia followed the Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology. The country was governed by the republic's sole party, Communist Party of Turkmenistan, a republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nThe politics of Turkmenia took place in the framework of a one-party socialist republic. The Supreme Soviet was a unicameral legislature of the republic headed by a Chairman. The Supreme Soviet's building was in Ashkhabad."}

Lawrence was an anti-slavery town. They were led by Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones. The attack made the irregular conflict in Kansas Territory worse. The conflicts later became known as \"Bleeding Kansas\".\nOnly one person died, and his death was by accident. However, the pro-slavery people destroyed two free-state newspapers, the \"Kansas Free State\" and the \"Herald of Freedom\".\nBefore.\nLawrence, Kansas was created in 1854 by anti-slavery people. They often were attacked by pro-slavery people because Lawrence was anti-slavery. Lawrence had almost been attacked during the Wakarusa War in 1855.\nPro-slavery sheriff Samuel Jones was shot when he was trying to arrest anti-slavery people. Many anti-slavery people believed that Jones being shot was the cause of the attack. Lawrence people made Jones leave after he was shot. Federal Marshal Israel B. Donaldson said that Jones being shot stopped him from following warrants. He decided to send 800 pro-slavery men to Lawrence to destroy anti-slavery newspapers and destroy the Free State Hotel.\nSack.\nOn May 21, 1856, Jones and Donaldson came to Lawrence. A group of many men were on Mount Oread, and they had a cannon. Charles L. Robinson's house was taken over and used as Jones's headquarters. Jones's men guarded the roads that went in and out of Lawrence to stop people from leaving. Jones's men flew many flags, such as the state flags of Alabama and South Carolina. Many flags had anti-Free State or pro-slavery messages on them such as \"Kansas the Outpost\", \"Southern Rights\", and \"Supremacy of the White Race\").\nShalor Eldridge, the owner of the Free State Hotel, learned of the coming pro-slavery men, and he came to meet them. Donaldson told him that he and his men would attack Lawrence only if the people of Lawrence resisted his men. Donaldson and Eldridge went to the Free State Hotel. There, Eldridge cooked a good meal that had fresh food and expensive wine. He made this meal so that Donaldson and his men would stay calm. Eldridge was interviewed by Donaldson while he and his men continued to eat the meal, then they left without paying. Shortly after, Donaldson let Jones command his men. Jones then asked to talk to a representative of the town. Samuel C. Pomeroy agreed to meet with Jones and talk to him about the situation. Jones was clear in what he wanted: for the people of Lawrence to give up all of their weapons. Pomeroy argued that there was not much he could do about that, since it was for the people to decide if they would give up their weapons. However, hoping to convince Jones to leave the city peacefully, Pomeroy agreed to give the city's only artillery piece. While Jones did take this cannon, it did not convince him as Pomeroy had hoped.\nIt was the \"Old Sacramento\" cannon that the pro-slavers used to try to destroy the Free State Hotel. This weapon had been kept in the Liberty Arsenal until it was taken by pro-slavery forces in 1855. (The cannon would eventually be taken by free-staters later in 1856 during the Second Battle of Franklin.)\nWhile Jones and his men were trying to destory the hotel, the printing offices of the \"Kansas Free State\" and the \"Herald of Freedom\" were destroyed; their libraries were thrown out the window, the presses were smashed, and the type was thrown in the river. Any papers left were either thrown into the wind to be carried off or were used by Jones and his men to burn down the Free State Hotel. When the newspapers and the hotel were destoryed, Jones's men then looted the town. As they retreated, they burned Robinson's home on Mount Oread for good measure.\nOne person\u2014a member of Jones's gang\u2014died during the attack when he was hit in the head by a falling bit of the Free State Hotel.\nAfter.\nWhile the Free State Hotel was destroyed, a man named Shalor Eldridge bought the destroyed ruins of the building. He decided to rebuild it as the \"Eldridge House\". This building remained until 1863, when it was burned down by William Quantrill during the Lawrence Massacre (after which it would be rebuilt two more times in 1866 and 1926, respectively).\nFor a many months after the Sack of Lawrence, the city was without a free state newspaper. This was made worse by the fact that Josiah Miller, who ran the \"Kansas Free State\", decided not to start his newspaper again. George Brown restarted the \"Herald of Freedom\" in November 1857, so Lawrence had a newspaper again.\nLawrence's only cannon was lost due to the sacking. This would be at least one reason that Free-Staters would attack Franklin's Fort in June and August of 1856; they hoped to get the \"Old Sacramento\" cannon so they could use it."}

She is a Democrat. Adams served as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state's 58th House district in Guilford County from her appointment in April 1994 until her election to Congress. She was succeeded by Ralph C. Johnson. A college administrator and art professor from Greensboro, Adams is known for the many distinctive hats that she wears (she claims to own 900). Adams won the 2014 special election North Carolina's 12th congressional district to fill the vacancy created after Mel Watt resigned. By winning, she became the 100th woman serving in the 113th Congress. She won election to a full two-year term at the same time.\nEarly life and education.\nAdams was born on May 27, 1946 in High Point, North Carolina. Her parents were Benjamin Shealey and the former Mattie Stokes. She graduated from West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, in 1964. Adams received her B.S. degree in 1969 and her M.S. degree in 1972, both from North Carolina A&amp;T University and both in Art Education. She continued her studies to receive her Ph.D. in Art Education/Multicultural Education from Ohio State University in 1981.\nPolitical career.\nState legislature.\nAdams was a member of the Greensboro City School Board from 1984 to 1986 and a Greensboro City Council member from 1987 until 1994.\nShe was appointed to the North Carolina House District 26 seat in 1994 to replace Herman Gist, who died in office. The district is in Guilford County and includes most of southeastern Greensboro. She had previously said she was going to challenge Gist for that seat in the Democratic primary that year. After being appointed to the seat, Adams faced conservative businessman and retired engineer O. C. Stafford in the Democratic primary. Adams won the primary election.\nAdams then won a full term in the general election, beating Republican Roger G. Coffer. She had a rematch with Stafford in the general elections of 1996 and 1998 (Stafford ran as a Republican). Adams won both elections. In 2000 Adams did not have an opponent in the Democratic primary; she defeated Republican real estate broker Jim Rumley in the general election.\nIn 2002, after redistricting, Adams' seat was changed from the 26th district to the 58th district. Her only challenger that year was Libertarian lawyer David Williams, who withdrew from the race in October because he was moving to Colorado. His name still appeared on the ballot, but Adams won with around 86% of the vote.\nAdams has been challenged for her seat for many years by Republican legal assistant and party activist Olga Morgan Wright. Wright has run for the seat held by Adams in nearly every election since 2004. Adams defeated Wright and Libertarian challenger Walter Sperko with 66% of the vote in 2004. In the next election Adams had no competition in the primary; she defeated Wright in the general election 66%\u201334%. In 2008, the year that Barack Obama was elected president, Democratic voters had a high rate of participation, and Adams defeated Wright 71.35%\u201328.65%\nIn 2008, Adams was elected to a second term as chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.\nShe was vice-chair of the Government Committee in the state House. Previously she was chair of the Appropriations Committee as well as vice-chair of the Commerce, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.\nIn 2010, Adams was challenged in the Democratic primary by Ralph C. Johnson. She defeated Johnson with 76.56% of the vote. Adams next faced Republican Darin H. Thomas in the general election, beating him 63.15%\u201336.85%. In 2012, Adams did not have any primary opposition and defeated Olga Wright in the general election by a margin of 79.86%\u201320.14%.\nCongress.\nIn April 2013, Mel Watt, the only congressman to have served the 12th District since its creation in 1993, was appointed as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Adams ran in the special election to replace him, and won. She was sworn in on November 12, 2014, to complete the remaining seven weeks of Watt's term. After swearing in, Adams became the 100th female member of the congressional class, beating the previous record of 99. Adams formally filed paperwork to run in both the Democratic primary for a full two-year term in the 114th Congress and the special election for the balance of Watt's 11th term. Adams won re-election in 2018.\nAnalysts thought that Adams was at a geographic disadvantage in the five-way primary for both the special and regular elections (held on the same day). She is from Greensboro, but the bulk of the district's population is in Charlotte. However, with three candidates from Charlotte in the race splitting that region's vote; Adams won both primaries with approximately 44 percent of the vote, a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff. She faced Republican Vince Coakley, a former television and radio broadcaster from Matthews, in both the general and special elections, which were held on the same day in November. The 12th was a heavily Democratic district with a majority-black voting population and a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+26, and Adams was favored in both the special and general election. She won both.\nAdams is the second woman of color to represent North Carolina in the House. The first was Eva Clayton, who represented much of eastern North Carolina from 1992 to 2002.\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Adams endorsed Hillary Clinton and pledged her support as a superdelegate.\nShe is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the Congressional Arts Caucus.\nOther work.\nAdams has been a professor of art at Bennett College in Greensboro, as well as the director of the Steel Hall Art Gallery. In 1990, Adams helped co-found, with Eva Hamlin Miller, the African American Atelier, an organization established to increase awareness and appreciation for visual arts and cultures of African Americans.\nShe is the chairperson of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation, which gives scholarships to students who are attending one of North Carolina's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\nPersonal life.\nAdams is divorced and has two children. She is noted for the many different hats that she wears."}

The tower has been in use for many centuries and is an important landmark in Waterford and an important part of its medieval defence. It is the oldest civic building in Ireland and it is the only city monument in Ireland to retain a Norse or Viking name.\nEarly history.\nReginald's Tower was built by the Normans when they came to Waterford. The tower's name is derived from a form of the Irish name \"Raghnall\". The tower's name seems to refer to one of the many Viking rulers of the town that bore the name. It might be Ragnall mac Gillemaire, the last Norse ruler of the town. The tower was probably built in the 13th or 14th century; it may have been constructed between 1253 and 1280. In 1185 Prince John of England landed in Waterford and organised the rebuilding of the city walls, including the tower.\nThe tower is 54 feet high and it is circular. It is 42\u00bd feet in diameter with a cone-shaped roof. There is a spiral staircase within the thick walls - these are 10 feet wide at the base, going down to 7 feet at the top. It was part of the old city walls of Waterford which were in a triangle formed by three structures \u2014 Turgesius Tower on Barronstrand Street, St. Martins Castle on Lady Lane, and Reginald\u2019s Tower at the Quay and the Mall. It was on the high ground between St. John's River on the southeast (since drained, and now known as the Mall) and the River Suir to the north. It is also very close to the historic French Church. It is also known as the Ring Tower. It was one of seventeen towers which circled the city of Waterford in medieval times. Today, it is the largest of the six surviving towers, which are considered the best examples of medieval urban defence in Ireland. The other surviving towers are the Watch Tower, Double Tower, French Tower, Semi-Lunar Tower and Beach Tower.\nMedieval history.\nThe tower has been used as a coin mint, a prison, and a military storehouse. It is also famous for being the location of the wedding of Richard de Clare, the second Earl of Pembroke, and Aoife (pronounced eefa), daughter of Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster. It sometimes was a royal castle and was visited by King John in 1210, who ordered new coins to be made there. Richard II visited the tower in 1394 and again in 1399. He used the tower to store his munitions. On 27 July 1399, Richard left Reginald's Tower as King of England and Wales; on his arrival in England, he was captured by the future Henry IV. \nIn 1463, coins were minted in Reginald's Tower by order of the Irish Parliament, which, at that time, was meeting in the city. The coins had the words \"Civitas Waterford\" struck on one side. In 1495, the tower\u2019s cannons successfully beat off the forces of Perkin Warbeck, the pretender to the throne of Henry VII. Cannons from the tower sank one of his ships during an 11-day battle. This was the first successful use of artillery by an Irish city. A cannon from this ship was recovered from the River Suir in 1901. This victory earned the city its motto \"Urbs Intacta Manet\" - \"Waterford remains the unconquered city\".\nIn 1649, Waterford was attacked by the army of Oliver Cromwell, but he failed to capture the city. They returned in 1650, and this time they were successful. A cannonball, visible high up the wall on the north side of the building, is lodged firmly in the wall, and is said to be from this siege.\nIn 1690, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, James II of England is supposed to have climbed to the top of the tower to take a last look at his lost kingdom before embarking for exile in France.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the tower was used to store ammunition. In the early 19th century it was a prison.\nPresent day.\nIn 1861, Reginald's Tower became the property of the Waterford Corporation, and the house of the Chief Constable of Waterford. It continued to be lived in until 1954 when the last person left and the building was turned into a museum. During the Second World War it was an air raid shelter. Now it is the Waterford Viking Museum and exhibits many of the archaeological finds from the 2003 dig at Woodstown on the River Suir near the city.\nIt is located in the area of Waterford Viking Triangle in the centre of Waterford city. A Viking longship is kept outside Reginald's Tower."}

Its studios are located at the GMA Network Center at the corner of Timog Avenue and Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in Quezon City, while its transmitter is located at the GMA Compound, Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat, Quezon City. It operates from Mondays thru Fridays 5:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays 5:30 a.m. to 12:00 midnight for both analog free TV and digital free TV, and It operates 24 hours daily for both cable TV and satellite TV.\nHistory.\nCitynet Television (1995\u20131999).\nDWDB-TV signed on for the first time on August 27, 1995, under the on-air brand Citynet Television 27 (or just Citynet 27). The station was programmed like an independent stationGMA intended Citynet 27 to be its main outlet for imported programming (particularly from the United States), freeing up slots in GMA Network's schedule for more domestic productions. Aside from an English dub of the Hispanic telenovela \"Ka Ina\", the only locally produced program on the station was Citynet Television News, a flagship TV news show produced by GMA News and Public Affairs.\nEMC 27 / Channel [V] Philippines (1999\u20132001).\nHowever, by 1999, the costs of operating the station in this format were becoming too high for GMA as well as the intense competition from Studio 23 (later renamed as ABS-CBN Sports and Action in 2014), a UHF television network owned by AMCARA Broadcasting Network and operated by ABS-CBN Corporation. As a result, DWDB was turned into a music channel under the interim branding EMC, the Entertainment Music Channelwhich was also the country's first locally operated music channel. A few months later, GMA reached a deal with Asian broadcaster STAR TV to allow DWDB to be a carrier of Channel V Philippines, which took effect December 19, 1999. GMA had already aired selected Channel V programming from its international version (which made the former VJ's and Filipino descented Trey Farley and Joey Mead familiar to viewers of DWDB). This arrangement did not last longa stake in GMA was recently purchased by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, who already owned MTV Philippines through the Nation Broadcasting Corporation and its parent company MediaQuest Holdings. This conflict of interest, along with the increasing competition from the MTV affiliated network, led to the channel signing-off on July 25, 2001.\nAbandoned plans, silent years, and as the carrier of GMA and QTV.\nAfter PLDT's acquisition stake of GMA and its inactivity, they already have bared plans to somehow relaunch this channel into a news channel. However, it didn't proceed as GMA had another plans for the station in the near future.\nProgramming would return to DWDB in 2004 as the relay of GMA-7 Manila with the logo of GMA was covered by the logo of Citynet. In November 2005, the station later became a repeater of DZOE 11which served as the flagship for GMA's newly-secondary national network QTV (or Quality Television, later renamed to just Q). GMA had reached an agreement with its owner, religious broadcaster ZOE Broadcasting Network, to allow GMA to handle programming for the station, in exchange for providing upgraded facilities for the broadcaster and airing ZOE-produced programming in QTV's lineup. DWDB's UHF signal had the advantage of easier to receive in the southern areas of Metro Manila, especially in the metropolitan cities of Makati and Pasay.\nThis practice was discontinued in 2007, as DWDB's channel number was vacated for use in trials of digital television.\nDigital broadcast.\nIn February 2013, GMA started its digital test broadcasts, simulcasting both GMA-7 and GMA News TV-11 using the Japanese ISDB-T digital TV platform using the channel's frequency.\nOn May 15, 2019, GMA Network's digital test broadcasts used the same frequency as its digital feed, and it also started its initial digital test broadcast on UHF Channel 15 (479.143 MHz), which served as the main digital feed of GMA Network when this frequency reverted to analog broadcast, and continued its service for the remainder of the analog feed.\nReversion to analog broadcast; GMA News TV (2019\u20132021).\nOn April 24, 2019, ZOE Broadcasting Network and GMA/Citynet announced that their blocktime agreement would expire by the end of May 2019. This ended their day partnership and in turn, their blocktime lease on VHF Channel 11 after 14 years.

As a result, Channel 27 digital broadcast was planned to switch off on May 27, 2019, as the station was supposedly conducting its test broadcast on the said date.

Ward 5B was established in San Francisco General Hospital in 1983. When the ward was opened there was little known about this illness, and patients with the disease were regarded as worthy of disgrace and/or disapproval.\nWhen Ward 5B was opened AIDS was considered a death sentence. Every single person diagnosed with AIDS died in those days. No one knew what caused this disease and how it was passed on from person to person. Some of the caregivers refused to treat patients. Patients in hospitals would not be bathed, because nurses did not want to touch them for fear of contracting AIDS themselves.\nWard 5B was the first hospital ward where the medical team comforted patients by touching them. Patients were allowed to furnish their rooms and make them like home. They were even allowed to bring in pets.Families and partners were allowed to visit patients any time.\nWard 5B became a model for many other hospitals in the United States and in other countries.\nCliff Morrison grew up in Live Oak, Florida. His family was a very poor. When he was young he worked on his family\u2019s farm. The family had no car, no telephone, no television and no access to healthcare.\nAt age twelve Morrison got a job at a local hospital mopping floors, taking out trash, and working in the laundry. He worked his way up to orderly. Doctors and nurses at the hospital liked him. They encouraged him to go to college and helped him get a scholarship.\nIn 1969 Morrison started studying at Florida Community College in Jacksonville when he was 17 years old. He was the youngest student ever in the nursing program. He was also the first person in his family to go to college. \nMorrison admits to being embarrassed studying what is considered a woman\u2019s profession.

Afterwards he moved to Miami to complete his education. \nIn 1980, Morrison became a clinical nurse specialist in the Department of Psychiatry and Forensic Services at San Francisco General."}

Barrow\u2019s Cabinet also urged him to remain as Leader of the UDP until February 2020. He said he will take that move and eventually scheduled the United Democratic Party (UDP) leadership election and convention to February 2020, meaning that the 2020 United Democratic Party leadership election and convention will be held in February 2020, unfortunately no firm date has been set yet. Barrow told the Media that he will schedule a few dates for the various ballots to take place when the date nearers. Nominations will be opened in January 2020 and so far two Candidates of the UDP will be contesting this Leadership election and convention. There will be a total of three ballots. The first ballot will be endorsment and voting by the current leader of the UDP and Prime Minister of Belize, Dean Barrow.The second ballot will be from the former members and Candidates of the UDP who will be voting and the third ballot is from the people of Belize. There will also be a exhaustive ballots of MPs also talking place in mid-February 2020. The ultimate decision will be made but the general membership of the party who will elect the leader by postal ballot. The results will be announced by the end of February 2020.\nSpeculation about a leadership election first arose back in 2006, just before the 2006 Belizean municipal elections. Barrow told LOVE FM that he will resign as Leader of the UDP If his party loses the Municipal Elections. The UDP has not defeated the than rulling People\u2019s United Party (PUP) in any election until the 2006 municipal elections and the UDP was not doing very well after Barrow called for Civil Unrest In 2005.

Barrow also stated that it was the proper thing to do and he would call for a Leadership election and convention if the UDP continues onto the path of darkness prior to the 2006 municipal elections. However, that all changed after the UDP won a landslide victory in the 2006 Municipal elections and eventually took control of the government realms in the 2008 Belizean general election on 7 February 2008.\nBackground\nAfter being in power for seven years the People\u2019s United Party was desperate to win the 2006 Belizean municipal elections and govern the country like never before. It has never lost even one election whether general election, municipal elections or Village council elections since coming to power after the 1998 Belizean general election on 27 August 1998. The UDP however, was faced with a shocking traumatic defeat in the 1998 general election with only three of the UDP Candidates getting elected in that General election. Barrow and Member of Parliament for Mesopotamia constituency, Michael Finnegan were the only two Members of Parliament and Area Representatives to be re-elected to their constituencies. Erwin Contreras narrowly defeated PUP\u2019s Amin Hegar In Cayo West constituency and became the only newly elected UDP MP and Area Representative. Several UDP Ministers and Members went down to defeat. One of them was prominent then Leader of the UDP, Manuel Esquivel who also served as Prime Minister of Belize since 1984 and has been leading the UDP since 1983.\nAftermath\nAfter the 1998 Belizean general election, Esquivel stepped down as Leader of the UDP On 28 August 1998, after being it's leader for 15 years. Esquivel also called a snap 1998 United Democratic Party (Belize) leadership election and convention on 28 August 1998. He scheduled the leadership election and convention to take place on 30 August 1998 and in his last address to the nation as leader of the UDP, Esquivel said that it's time for the UDP to \u201crenew itself from the top and embark once more on the road to victory\u201d. Nomination day was open on 29 August 1998 and than First Deputy Leader of the UDP, Barrow was the only person who submitted his nominations to contest in the UDP leadership election and convention at deadline. When the results for the 1998 United Democratic Party Leadership election and convention were out, Barrow won unopposed as Leader of the UDP and was sworn-in by Governor-General of Belize, Colville Young as Leader of the UDP and Leader of the Opposition.

Bhaba was the secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy when it was founded in 1950. He supported Sarabhai in creating India's first rocket launch station. In 1962, the Indian National Committee for Space Research was set up by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1969, ISRO was created to follow INCOSPAR.\nSpace flight programs.\nLike other space programs, ISRO has had many successes and failures. In the beginning, ISRO built satellites that were then launched by other countries, like the Soviet Union. Later, ISRO built many types of rockets. Some of those rockets are now decommissioned, meaning ISRO does not use them anymore. In the future, India also wants to send people to space and send more missions to other planets. \nLaunch vehicles.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s India began its own rocket program. ISRO has had five different types of rockets.\nThe Satellite Launch Vehicle was a 4-stage solid-propellant light launcher. It was supposed to be tall and be able to carry . The first launch was in 1979 and launched every year until 1983. It launched successfully for the first time on July 18, 1980. This means that India is the sixth country to get spaceflight by itself. It is now decomissioned.\nThe Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle was a five-stage solid propellant rocket. It was able to carry into low Earth orbit. The design was based on the SLV and the project started in the 1980s. The rocket was tested in 1987, 1988, 1992, and 1994 and only two of them were successful. It is now decommissioned.\nThe Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle uses an expendable launch system to carry things into space. It is still in use.\nThe Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle also uses an expendable launch system, this time to launch INSAT-type satellites. Currently it is India's second-heaviest launch vehicle and can launch up to into low Earth orbit. There are multiple marks, or versions of this rocket. It is still in use.\nSatellites.\nIndia's first satellite, which was called the Aryabhata, was launched by the Soviet Union. Since then India has built and launched many different satellites.\nRohini series.\nRohini is a series of four satellites. These satellites were launched by the Satellite Launch Vehicle, and three of them were able to make it into orbit. \nINSAT series.\nThe Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) is a series of satellites built and launched by ISRO. These help India with telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search-and-rescue.\nIRS series.\nThe Indian Remote Sensing satellites (IRS) are a series of satellites built and launched by ISRO. It is the largest series of remote sensing satellites for regular people in the world. \nRadar Imagine Satellites.\nIndia(Bharat) has two Radar Imaging Satellites (RISAT).\nSouth Asia Satellite.\nThe South Asia Satellite is a communications satellite launched in 2017 as a gift to the other countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \nGPS-aided geo-augmented navigation satellite system.\nAlso known as GAGAN, this is a national plan for satellite navigation. \nIRNSS satellite navigation system.\nThe Independent Regional Navigation Satellite System is made to have accurate position information to people in India as well as 1500 km from its borders.

ISRO first planned to launch the satellites between 2012 and 2014, but it had to be moved to later years.\nHuman spaceflight.\nThe first Indian cosmonaut is Rakesh Sharma, who flew with two Russians in Salyut 7 in 1984. The first female Indian astronaut was Kalpana Chawla. She died in in 2003. The second female Indian astronaut, Sunita Williams, spent 321 days 17 hours 15 minutes in space.\nExploring other planets.\nIn 2008 ISRO sent Chandrayaan-1 to the moon. It helped discover evidence of water on the moon. ISRO flew the Mars Orbiter Mission in 2013 and it reached Mars in 2014, making India the 4th country to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mars.\nFuture.\nChandrayaan-2 is the India's second moon mission. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019 at 2:43 PM IST (09:13 UTC) to the Moon by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III). It includes an orbiter, lander, and rover that will study the moon both on and above the surface. The mission spent some time orbiting Earth before going to the moon. The lander will reach the lunar south pole on 7 September 2019 at 01:55 IST (6 September 2019, 20:25 UTC). Other than Chandrayaan-2, ISRO may team up with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, for a mission looking for water on the Moon.\nThe next Mars mission will be the Mars Orbiter Mission 2, and will be launched in 2022 or 2023. \nThe first mission to the Sun will be a probe called Aditya-L1. It was originally planned for 2012, but was delayed to 2021. It will study solar wind and space weather.\nThe first mission to Venus will be an orbiter mission called Shukrayaan-1, that may launch in 2023.\nIn 2018, prime minister Narendra Modi said that India will send astronauts into space by 2022."}

{"id": "702125", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=702125", "title": "Earth phase", "text": "The Earth phase, Terra phase, Terrestrial phase or phase of the Earth, is the shape of the directly sunlit portion of the Earth as viewed from the Moon (or elsewhere extraterrestrially). From the Moon, the Earth phases gradually and cyclically change over a period of about a month, as the orbital positions of the Moon around the Earth and of the Earth around the Sun shift.\nOverview.\nAmong the most prominent features of the Moon's sky is Earth. Earth's apparent size is four times the Moon's as seen from Earth. However, because the Moon's orbit is eccentric, Earth's size in the sky may be a bit smaller or larger at times. Earth shows phases, just like the Moon does for observers on the Earth. The phases, however, are opposite; when the observer on the Earth sees the \"full Moon\", the observer on the Moon sees a \"new Earth\", and vice versa. Earth's albedo is three times as high as that of the Moon (due in part to its whitish cloud cover), and coupled with the wider area, the \"full Earth\" glows over 50 times brighter than the \"full Moon\" does for the observer on Earth. This Earth light reflected on the Moon's darkened near-side half is bright enough to be visible from Earth \u2013 a phenomenon known as Earthshine.\nAs a result of the Moon's synchronous rotation, one side of the Moon (the \"near side\") is permanently turned towards Earth, and the other side, the \"far side\", mostly cannot be seen from Earth. This means, conversely, that Earth can be seen only from the near side of the Moon and would always be invisible from the far side.\nIf the Moon's rotation were purely synchronous, Earth would not have any noticeable movement in the Moon's sky. However, due to the Moon's libration, Earth does perform a slow and complex wobbling movement. Once a month, as seen from the Moon, Earth traces out a small oval. The exact shape and orientation of this oval depend on one's location on the Moon. As a result, near the boundary of the near and far sides of the Moon, Earth is sometimes below the horizon and sometimes above it.\nTo be aware, although genuine photographs of the Earth viewed from the Moon exist, many from NASA, some photographs shared on social media, that are purported to be the Earth viewed from the Moon, may not be real.\nEclipses from the Moon.\nEarth and the Sun sometimes meet in the lunar sky, causing an eclipse. On Earth, one would see a lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a solar eclipse, when the Sun goes behind the Earth. Since the apparent diameter of the Earth is four times as large as that of the Sun, the Sun would be hidden behind the Earth for hours. Earth's atmosphere would be visible as a reddish ring. During the Apollo 15 mission, an attempt was made to use the Lunar Roving Vehicle's TV camera to view such an eclipse, but the camera or its power source failed after the astronauts left for Earth.\nSolar eclipse shadows, when the Moon blocks sunlight to the Earth, on the other hand, would not be as spectacular for observers on the Moon viewing the Earth: the Moon's umbra nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would be barely visible. The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object away. Observers on the Moon with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot at the center of a less dark region (penumbra) traveling across the full Earth's disk. It would look essentially the same as it does to the Deep Space Climate Observatory, which orbits Earth at the L1 Lagrangian point in the Sun-Earth system, from Earth.\nIn summary, whenever an eclipse of some sort is occurring on Earth, an eclipse of another sort is occurring on the Moon. Eclipses occur for observers on both Earth and the Moon whenever the two bodies and the Sun align in a straight line, or syzygy."}

Boats can be from small dinghies to large yachts. Usually, the small boats will just race each other and be of the same type. This is called one-design racing. Larger boats will often be of different sizes and race with a handicap system.\nYacht racing.\nOn the water, a large sailing competition among different boats is a regatta. This is usually a number of races, where the boat crew that performs the best over the series of races is the winner. A lot of racing is done around buoys or marks in safe water near the shore but some longer offshore races cross open water.\nAmerica's Cup.\nIt could be said that the sport of international yacht racing began with the America's Cup in 1851. A group of members from the New York Yacht Club built a 101-foot schooner which they called America. This yacht was sailed to England where it won a challenge race for a trophy called the Hundred Guineas Cup. The race course took them around the Isle of Wight. This trophy was subsequently renamed The America's Cup and remained with the New York Yacht Club until 1983. An Australian yacht called Australia 2 finally took it from them after 132-years.\nFamous yacht races.\nThere are a number of famous yacht races being held every year is different parts of the world. These are held using large yachts and involve racing for a number of days without stopping. It is a test of skill and strength over a long time.\nSome of the most famous races are:\nOcean racing.\nSeveral famous round-the-world races are held also and these are: \nDinghy racing.\nHistory.\nThe oldest known one-design sailing dinghy is the Water Wag. In 1887 a Mr Thomas Middleton proposed the idea of one design sailing punts, with centreboards all built and rigged the same. A number of these were built and the first race took place on April 12, 1887, in Kingstown (now D\u00fan Laoghaire) Harbour near Dublin in Ireland.\nNow dinghy racing is a worldwide sport and holds events and championships in many classes every year.\nOlympic Sailing.\nThis is done entirely in small boats known as keelboats and dinghies. A keelboat has a weighted keel to keep it upright and a dinghy just uses a centreboard and the boat must be balanced by the crew. These were divided into different groups of identical boats called Classes. The first sailing Olympics took place in 1900 at Meulan near Le Havre in France. Over the years the classes of boats allowed to compete have changed because of new design and technology.\nFleet racing.\nRaces are sailed in fleets of equal boats racing around the same course at the same time. These race courses include different sailing angles: upwind, downwind and reaching.\nMatch racing.\nThis is one boat against another over a short course. It is important that the boats are the same and it is the normal race now used for the America's Cup but it is also sometimes used for racing in yacht clubs.\nClass rules.\nThe Racing Rules of Sailing are used for the sport of yacht racing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, model boat racing, dinghy racing and any other form of racing around a course with more than one boat while powered by the wind."}

The building is named after Shalor Eldridge. He was an important anti-slavery person who built the building in the mid-1800s. The building is currently used as a hotel.\nHistory.\nThe Eldridge House Hotel can trace its origin back to the New England Emigrant Aid Company, which was a transportation company in Boston, Massachusetts. They wanted to bring anti-slavery people to Kansas. This was because of the Kansas-Nebraska Act allowing residents in a territory to decide if they wanted slavery. The company built a resting place in Lawrence for these people. They called it the Free State Hotel.\nOn May 21, 1856, Douglas County sheriff Samuel J. Jones and a big group of pro-slavery men came to Lawrence. They burned down the Free State Hotel as part of the Sack of Lawrence. After this, the anti-slavery man Shalor Eldridge built a new hotel. He called it the Eldridge House, named after himself. This building stayed until August 21, 1863, when Confederate leader William Quantrill and his raiders burned the hotel and the city to the ground.\nEldridge began to build another hotel. It finished in 1866 under George W. Deitzler. This building was updated in 1925; the new version stayed until the mid-to-late 1960s, when it closed due to competition with motels. The building became an apartment complex on July 1, 1970. People in Lawrence wanted to see the Eldridge re-open as a hotel again in the 1980s. A group of investors got $1 million, and the city of Lawrence also gave $2 million to make this happen. In the late 1980s, the building became a hotel again. In 2004, the hotel was purchased by a new group of investors. They changed it back \"to its original 1925 grandeur (the style of the hotel).\" The hotel opened in 2005."}

(ZBNI). Its studios are located at Strata 2000 Bldg., F. Ortigas Jr. Avenue, Ortigas Center, Pasig City. Its transmitter is located at ZOE Compound Center, Crestview Heights Subdivision, Barangay San Roque, Antipolo, Rizal. Light TV Channel 33 operates Mondays thru Fridays 5:00 AM to 12:00 MN and Saturdays and Sundays 5:30 AM to 12:00 MN.\nChannel History.\nBefore 2006, ZOE Broadcasting Network operated on VHF Channel 11, after being awarded from its previous owner Delta Broadcasting System in 1998. By 2005, ZOE Broadcasting agreed to lease the entire airtime of ZOE-TV Channel 11 to Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc., a subsidiary of GMA Network, Inc., in exchange of airing programs of ZOE-TV in GMA Network and an upgraded transmitter facilities for ZOE-TV on GMA Tower of Power. However, due to increasing lease payments of GMA Network to ZOE Broadcasting which is accompanied with decreased revenues of the former, GMA/Citynet terminated its agreement by June 4, 2019, with Channel 11 shutting down on the following day. Channel 11 would again reactivated its transmitter in June 2020, and became an affiliate of ABS-CBN, due to the latter's expiration of their franchise; currently airing as A2Z Channel 11 since October 2020.\nZOE Broadcasting began its test broadcast in UHF Channel 33 in May 2006. At that time, it with its airing of job opening program \"Future Finder\" on limited broadcast hours in preparation for a relaunch of DZOZ-TV's new branding on November 27, 2006. On that day, after the series of test broadcasts, it began broadcasting, then under a blocktime agreement between ZOE and Makati-based Estima, Inc. The result of the deal was student-oriented channel UniversiTV. The channel has proven to be a hub for college and university students, catering them with evening and overnight programs everyday. By that time, it operated from 4 pm to 8 am the following day, but eventually retracted its broadcast hours until 4 am during its last few months of airing. However, on March 10, 2008, UniversiTV ceased its agreement with Channel 33, possibly due to poor ratings and lack of advertisers' support. This made ZOE TV left with almost no programming to offer along with its old Station ID, though, they surprisingly aired entertainment programs in the evening and a weekday morning TeleRadyo-formatted news program under the ZTV 33 brand. UniversiTV on the other hand, was then relaunched as a Pay TV channel via satellite and cable operators, but totally ceased operations by 2010.\nOn March 1, 2011, (a day after the network's sister station Channel 11 was relaunched as GMA News TV, seen on Channel 27 until 2021; which is now known as GTV), Channel 33 was rebranded as Light TV 33, introducing new programs produced by ZOE, and at the same time, the network launched its flagship newscast entitled \"News Light\". Soon, Channel 33 regained all of its programming with programs mostly dedicated to religious formats. On March 31, 2014, Light TV 33 was renamed as Light Network, launched its refreshed logo, and had a new slogan called \"Experience Light\", while retaining the slogan \"Kaibigan Mo\" (Your Friend).\nOn February 12, 2018, Light Network was renamed back as Light TV with its new slogan \"God's Channel of Blessings\". At the same time, the channel started live broadcasts of JIL Worship Services during Sunday mornings (simulcast via A2Z Channel 11 since November 1, 2020) and Jesus the Healer Friday Night Healing Services.\nOn March 4, 2019, Light TV has launched the new radio-on-television format show Light TV Radio which aired Daylight Devotions, News Light sa Umaga, and Bangon na Pilipinas. Then followed by the Edge TV. These programs are streamed online via Light TV Facebook Page, and simulcast on DZJV 1458 kHz in Laguna and DWZB 91.1 FM in Palawan, while Edge TV is also streamed online through their Facebook page. But on October 5, 2019, since UCAPehan has successfully launch on Light TV, the station signs on at 9:00 am every Saturday, but on January 4, 2020, it retracted its Saturday hours of operations from 12:00nn to 11:00pm, a week after the last airing of UCAPehan on December 28, 2019.\nDigital television.\nDigital channels.\nDZOZ-TV operates on UHF Channel 33 (587.143\u00a0MHz), and is multiplexed into the following subchannels:\nAnalog-to-digital conversion.\nOn March 1, 2017, Light Network became the first television network in the country to abandon analog transmissions and migrated to digital television. The night before, network chief engineer Antonio Soriano permanently ceased Channel 33's analog signal, triggering the country's shift to all-digital television. The station then flash-cut the digital signal to the abandoned analog channel for post-transition operations. However, the arrangement had ended, when the management decided to reactivate its old flagship station, Channel 11 (currently as A2Z Channel 11), one year after GMA News TV left the frequency and moved to UHF 27."}

The boat is sailed using the crew for balance.\nHistory.\nSmall boats have always been used to bring people and produce around. This might mean from place to place but often from an anchored ship to the shore.\nCharles II of England had a sailing dinghy given to him when he returned from exile to England in the 17th century.\nIn 1887 Thomas Middleton, a Dublin solicitor, thought that yacht racing was too expensive. He then invented the one-design boat. He wanted yacht racing to show just skill at sailing with all boats to be the same. He found some other people who agreed with him and they decided on a design for the new boat. They decided to call the boat 'The Water Wag'. The Water Wag Club is still in D\u00fan Laoghaire harbour (near Dublin, Ireland), and they race every Wednesday evening during the Summer.\nNow, there are a great many classes of sailing dinghies in use in yacht clubs around the world and it is a major Olympic sport.\nDinghy classes.\nDinghy designs are often called \"classes\"; these classes are usually either one design or development. The idea is that One Designs provide a fair and even competition, but Development Classes make new faster and better boats. The first International one-design class was the B.R.A. 12\u00a0foot dinghy which was designed by George Cockshott in 1914 for West Kirby marine lake near Liverpool, England. This design then went to the Netherlands, Germany, France, Ireland etc.\nSailing skiffs are the hardest type of dinghy to sail. A skiff is small with large sails called a spinnaker, a jib and mainsail. It also has racks (like wings) and trapeze. The 49er dinghy, an Olympic boat is a sailing skiff.\nSome high-performance dinghies are the Flying Dutchman, the International 505, the Jet 14, the Fireball, the Osprey, the Thistle, the International 470 and the Moth.\nThere is also a type of dinghy called a Sports boat. These classes are larger racing dinghies with keels. Usually, they have several crew members. The Melges 24 and Laser SB3 are examples of this type.\nOlympic sailing.\nThis is done entirely in dinghies. The first sailing Olympics took place in 1900 at Meulan near Le Havre in France. Over the years the classes of boats allowed to compete have changed because of new design and technology. Classes of dinghies sailed in the Olympics now are the Finn, the 470, the 49er, the Laser and the Nacra which is a catamaran (two hulls)."}

When a boat or ship is being built then the keel laying down is the first step and the date is noted as the start of the job. Only the launching of the ship more important.\nHistory.\nEvidence of early wooden ship keels has been found in various sites around the world. In Europe, Viking longships have been found which were buried but still show their keel and the way the boat was built.\nThe adjustable centerboard keel traces its roots to the medieval Chinese Song dynasty. Many Song Chinese junk ships had a ballasted and bilge keel that consisted of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. Maritime technology and the technological know-how allowed Song dynasty ships to be used in naval warfare between the Southern Song Dynasty, the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), and the Mongols.\nMetal keels.\nThe most common type of keel is the \"flat plate keel\", and this is fitted to ocean-going ships and other vessels. A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the \"bar keel\", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries.\nNon-sailing keels.\nIn non-sailing boats, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the keel, which comes out from the bottom of the hull. There are many types of keels, including full keels, long keels, fin keels, winged keels, bulb keels, and twin keels among other designs.\nYacht keels.\nThe keel works by changing the sideways movement of the wind into a forward movement. It also gives weight to the boat.\nKeels are different from centreboards and made of heavy materials to give weight to steady the boat. Keels may be fixed or they may lift up to allow sailing when the water is not deep. The amount of sail use is smaller when sailing with the keel up in the boat.\nOther types of keels are swing keels and canting keels. Canting keels can move sideways and can be on racing yachts, such as those in the Volvo Ocean Race."}

Each episode has the same structure. At the beginning of the episode, some of the Numberjacks will be engaged in an activity that will have relevance to the problem that is later discovered. Then an \"agent\" (a live-action child) will call in and describe the problem that is occurring. One or two of the Numberjacks will go out into the real world to solve the problem, while the remaining Numberjacks stay in their base and watch their progress on a screen. As soon as the problem is understood, 5 will worry about all the things that can happen. In the second series she does not worry about the dancing cow quite so much.\nOnce outside, the Numberjacks are shown in a live-action setting (although still animated themselves). They diagnose the problem by examination and with help from additional ideas from the agents, who call into the base. The problems are usually solved by creating and sending \"brain gain\", a magic force that can correct the problems once the solution is understood.\nOnce solved, the Numberjacks return to their base, replay what happened on a screen and then ask a question for the viewers.\nThe problems encountered are all based around simple mathematical concepts and the programme is intended to stimulate young children's interest in mathematics.\nCharacters.\nHeroes.\nThe Numberjacks are the heroes. Each of the numbers 0-9 is an individual character and each is broadly the age of his or her number. 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 are male, while 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 are female.

It is a very old way of making lumber, and was used in ancient times. Before the industrial era it was the normal way to make wood beams. Today it has mostly been replaced by sawmills, but is in some use. \nDefinitions.\n\"Hew\" is a word that means to strike, blow, chop, or gash with a tool such as an axe or sword. It is used in warfare, stone and wood cutting, and coal and salt mining. This is the root word for hewing. \n\"Hewing\" wood is to shape a log with a sharp item such as an axe with the goal to flatten one or more sides.\nMethods.\nAs \"hewing\" has been used since ancient times, more than one way has been made to do each step. But in general, there are four steps in the process. \nPrepare log.\nThe first step is to prepare the log (or tree trunk). After a tree is selected and cut down, hewing can be done at the place where the log landed. Or the log can be moved out of the woods to a work site. The log is then usually placed across two smaller logs. It is kept steady by notching the support logs or by a long bar of iron with a tooth on either end. Then the person doing the hewing measures where to cut and marks lines along the log. These are usually done with a chalk line.\nScoring.\nThe next step is to make notches every foot or two of the log. These are made almost as deep as the marked line. This is called scoring. There are at least three methods that can be used in scoring.\nJoggling or juggling.\nThe next step is know as either joggling or juggling. In this step the pieces of wood between the notches are knocked off with an axe. The result is a rough surface cut down almost to the marked line. The steps to this point remove a much wood and make the last step hewing easier.\nHewing.\nThe last step is called hewing. (The entire process is called hewing as well). This step is done on the sides of the log using a broadaxe. Hewing is started from the bottom of the trem stem upwards toward what was the top of the tree. This reduces the risk of broken fibers that may move inwards toward the beam.\nIt is also possible to use an adze to hew the top surface of a log. In the past, shipbuilders often used adzes to shape ship timbers. The choice of tool (either axe or adze) was made based on the position of the log to hew. The sides are best hewn with an axe and the top best hewn with an adze. \nAfter the hewing is done, other tools are used to make the surface smooth. This can be done with a hand plane, drawknife, or yariganna.\nModern uses.\nSome people still used hand-hewn beams in modern building, but it is very rare. A more common use is the re-use of old hand-hewn beams taken from old buildings. They are also popular as decor in some buildings."}

In his six seasons in the Major Leagues he was never a day-to-day player, usually coming off the bench just to pinch hit. After his contract expired following the 1982 season, Bass signed with the Hanshin Tigers who made him their starting first baseman. Bass is often credited with single-handedly turning around the fortunes of the Tigers, which ultimately resulted in the team's pennant run and Japan Series title in 1985.\nBass adapted quickly to Japanese pitching, hitting 35 home runs in his first season in 1983, and became the Tigers' star slugger for several seasons. He won four consecutive league batting titles; in 1986, he nearly became the first player in Japan to bat .400, finishing the season with a .389 average. Bass won consecutive batting Triple Crowns (1985 and 1986)."}

As of August 2015, for the first time in nearly 130 years, the city doesn't have a city council. There was also no one who ran for mayor in April 2015. The future of Frederick is unknown because Rice County isn't able to un-incorporate the city. State law says that residents must bring a petition to the city council. Then a special election will be called for a vote. Since there isn't a city council, it can't happen.\nIn November 2016, the community voted on whether to un-incorporate Frederick. Election workers at the Eureka Township voting location made a mistake. They accidentally gave the wrong ballots to township residents who didn't actually live in Frederick. 20 people voted. 13 voted to keep the city, but only 9 people live in Frederick. The mistake was noticed more than a week after the vote was certified. There is only a 5 day window to contest a vote. Because of this, Kansas Law kept the results. Frederick is still a city.\nIn November 2017, another ballot issue was voted on whether to un-incorporate the city. The vote was 2-2.\nGeography.\nFrederick is at (38.513108, -98.267756).

He was one of the founders of the Indian National Congress. A notable ornithologist, Hume has been called \"the Father of Indian Ornithology\" and, by those who found him dogmatic, \"the Pope of Indian ornithology\".\nAs an administrator of Etawah, he saw the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as a result of misgovernance and made great efforts to improve the lives of the common people. The district of Etawah was among the first to be returned to normality and over the next few years Hume's reforms led to the district being considered a model of development. Hume rose in the ranks of the Indian Civil Service and, in 1871 to the position of secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture, and Commerce under Lord Mayo. His criticism of Lord Lytton, however, led to his removal from the Secretariat in 1879.\nHe left India in 1894 to live in London from where he continued to take an interest in the Indian National Congress. After retiring from the civil services and towards the end of Lord Lytton's rule, Hume observed that the people of India had a sense of hopelessness and wanted to do something, noting \"a sudden violent outbreak of sporadic crime, murders of obnoxious persons, robbery of bankers and looting of bazaars, acts really of lawlessness which by a due coalescence of forces might any day develop into a National Revolt.\" Concerning the British government, he stated that a studied and invariable disregard, if not actually contempt for the opinions and feelings of our subjects, is at the present day the leading characteristic of our government in every branch of the administration.\nThe idea of the Indian Union took shape and Hume initially had some support from Lord Dufferin for this, although the latter wished to have no official link to it. It has been suggested that the idea was originally conceived in a private meeting of seventeen men after a Theosophical Convention held at Madras in December 1884. Hume took the initiative, and it was in March 1885, when the first notice was issued convening the first Indian National Union to meet at Poona the following December.\nHe attempted to increase the Congress base by bringing in more farmers, townspeople and Muslims between 1886 and 1887 and this created a backlash from the British, leading to backtracking by the Congress. Hume was disappointed when Congress opposed moves to raise the age of marriage for Indian girls and failed to focus on issues of poverty. Some Indian princes did not like the idea of democracy. In 1892, he tried to get them to act by warning of a violent agrarian revolution but this only outraged the British establishment and frightened the Congress leaders. Disappointed by the continued lack of Indian leaders willing to work for the cause of national emancipation, Hume left India in 1894.\nMany Anglo-Indians were against the idea of the Indian National Congress. The press in India tended to look upon it negatively, so much so that Hume is said to have held a very low opinion of journalists even later in life. A satirical work published in 1888 included a character called \"A. O. Humebogue\".\nThe organizers of the 27th session of the Indian National Congress at Bankipur (26\u201328 December 1912) recorded their \"profound sorrow at the death of Allan Octavian Hume, C.B., father and founder of the Congress, to whose lifelong services, rendered at rare self-sacrifice, India feels deep and lasting gratitude, and in whose death the cause of Indian progress and reform sustained an irreparable loss.\""}

He started his career in an investment bank called Bear Stearns. A few years later, made his own investment bank, \"J. Epstein &amp; Co.\" He was born in New York City to Jewish parents.\nIn 2008, he was arrested for paying an underage girl for prostitution. He spent 13 months in \"custody with work release\", which means that he was allowed to be outside of prison for up to 16\u00a0hours per day. Epstein was arrested again on July 6, 2019. He was arrested because he did sex trafficking of minors in the states of Florida and New York. Epstein has been a registered sex offender since 2008.\nOn August 10, 2019, he killed himself by hanging. The medical examiner told court that Epstein committed suicide, but Epstein's lawyers disagreed. On August 29, 2019, the judge decided to end the criminal investigation of Epstein.\nCareer.\nEpstein was teaching calculus and physics at the Dalton School in Manhattan between 1973 and 1975. In 1976, Epstein started work as an options trader (a job where stock brokers can buy or sell shares at an agreed price at a later date) at Bear Stearns, where he advised very rich people on financial strategies relating to taxes. As he was shown to be a successful worker during his financial career, Epstein became promoted to a limited partner (a job that manages money within a company) at Bear Stearns in 1980.\nJeffrey Edward Epstein had founded his investment bank, \"J. Epstein &amp; Co.\" in 1982. His investment bank had managed the assets of every person who had invested at his investments bank. Currently, his investment bank is worth more than US $1\u00a0billion.\nCriminal history.\nFirst signs of criminal activity (2005\u201306).\nIn March 2005, a woman called Florida's Palm Beach Police Department because she was concerned about what happened to her 14-year-old stepdaughter. She said to them that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein's mansion by an older girl. In the mansion, the woman claimed that her stepdaughter been paid $300 to strip and massage Epstein. The stepdaughter was claimed to be undressed. When she left Epstein's mansion, she wearing still wearing her underwear.\nPolice spent 11 months investigating Epstein and his home. The Federal Bureau of Investigation were also investigating Epstein and his home. It was discovered that Epstein was confirmed to have paid girls under 18 years old to perform sexual acts on him. Both the police and the FBI interviewed five claimed victims and 17 witnesses about this incident. Based on what they were discussing in the interviews, it was discovered that there are photos of abused underaged girls found in Epstein's trash. In fact, some of the trashed photos were confirmed to match the interviewed victims.\nIn 2006, it was discovered that Epstein would often secretly install cameras everywhere around his property. Often he installs secret cameras everywhere around his property so that he can record sexual activity with underage girls by famous people. It was also discovered that Epstein used blackmail to threaten those famous people deceptively through his secret recordings. These criminal claims were obtained from information relating to a previous lawsuit made by those famous people in 2006. Epstein was claimed to have used underaged girls to spy on those famous people, which allowed him to blackmail those famous people. In 2015, it was revealed that Prince Andrew, Duke of York was one of the victims who were abused by Epstein's blackmailing. One of the former employees who worked for Jeffrey Epstein had stated that Epstein would receive three massages per day by the underaged girls. Eventually the FBI received proof that indeed Epstein was blackmailing famous people by spying on famous people.\nIn May 2006, the Palm Beach police had concluded that Jeffrey Epstein will be charged with four counts of unlawful sex with minors and one count of molestation (forcing sexual abuse). However, the court disagrees. Epstein had a team of defense lawyers. His team of defense lawyers included Roy Black, Russell Crowe, Gerald Lefcourt, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. In 2007, Ken Starr, the Special Prosecutor of Bill Clinton, joined in to protect Epstein. The police chief of Palm Beach, Michael Reiter, blamed the court for being too flexible when it comes to Epstein's criminal case. Additionally, the police chief was not satisfied that court did not pass on the information clearly enough to the FBI.\nIn the end, the grand jury said only that Epstein had a single charge of unfair payment of prostitution. In 2006, they concluded that Epstein had pleaded not guilty.\nNon-prosecution agreement (NPA) (2006\u20132008).\nOn February 6, 2008, an anonymous woman from Virginia filed a lawsuit worth $50 million against Epstein. She claims that when she was 16 years old between 2004 and 2005, she was sexually assaulted by Epstein. Initially, she was \"recruited to give Epstein a massage\", but later on Epstein went naked and had sexual intercourse with her. He paid her $200 immediately afterwards. In March 2008, a similar $50 million lawsuit was filed against Epstein by another woman who was sexually abused. However, these lawsuits alongside similar lawsuits were dismissed (all of these lawsuits were cancelled and ignored). Epstein deals with these types of lawsuits outside of court by paying the victims with compensation money.\nOn 2008, he had a secret non-prosecution agreement with court that allowed him to have a lower court penalty while at the same time still keeping his luxury private locations. Instead of having a life sentence, he was only jailed for 18 months (but served 13 months in jail) and only had to settle the victims with payments of money. However, he still had to register as a sex offender.\nArrest and registration as a sex offender (2008\u20132011).\nIn 2008, he had a secret agreement with court that he would receive a lower court penalty. Along with a shorter jail sentence, he was allowed \"custody with work release\", which means that he was allowed to be outside of prison for up to 16 hours per day. Epstein spent 13months inside jail. After he was released from jail, he received one year of house arrest (punishment by \"jailing\" into their own house while supervised with a supervisor officer) with probation (regular official supervision required by law) until August 2010. While he was on probation, he was allowed to travel in his plane to his private homes in the city Manhattan and in the U.S. Virgin Islands. He was allowed long shopping trips and to walk around Palm Beach \"for exercise\".\nAfter a difficult court hearing (a type of law negotiation where a change in court penalty is to be discussed and agreed upon) was made in January 2011, he had stayed registered in New York State as a \"level three\" (high risk of repeat offense) sex offender for the rest of his life. At that court hearing, the Manhattan District Attorney tried to argue that Epstein should be reduced to a low-risk \"level one\", but he was refused by the judge. Epstein told the judge that his \"main\" home was in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The judge told him that he had to check in with the New York Police Department every 90days. Even though Epstein had been a level-three registered sex offender in New York since 2010, the New York Police Department never enforced the 90-day regulation, despite the fact that not following these rules is considered against the law.\nTrafficking of young girls (2019).\nOn July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey because he was doing sex trafficking. According to witnesses and sources, it is believed that the FBI broke into Epstein's Manhattan townhouse, the Herbert N. Straus House, to investigate Epstein's criminal behavior further. Two days later, the Public Corruption Unit of the Southern District of New York charged Epstein for attempted sex trafficking of minors. Court documents show that Epstein was attempting to bring at least 40 underaged girls to his mansion to sexually abuse them. Judge Kenneth Marra is currently deciding whether Epstein should continue being protected from harsher court punishments.\nIt was discovered that Epstein owned a private Boeing 727 jet that he had used to invite underaged guests to his mansion. He would travel in his private jet frequently, logging \"600 flying hours a year (...) usually with guests on board.\"\nPersonal life.\nJeffrey Epstein had long history with meeting with famous people because he was a successful businessman. He was friends with Prince Andrew and Tom Barrack, and had joined parties with many famous people, including Bill Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, Donald Trump, Katie Couric, and Woody Allen.\nEpstein also is interested in funding science research and education. In 2000, he established the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, which funds science research and education. Before 2003, the foundation funded Martin Nowak's research at the Institute for Advanced Study in the city of Princeton, New Jersey. In May 2003, Epstein had created the \"Program for Evolutionary Dynamics\" at Harvard University, a program aimed to research evolution, with a $30\u00a0million gift.\nDeath.\nOn July 23, 2019, he was found unconscious in his jail cell with injuries to his neck. His cellmate, former police officer Nicholas Tartaglione, was asked by police if he had tried to murder Epstein at 1:30am, since he had history of murdering people. He told them that he didn't do anything violent to Epstein. When police asked Epstein about that incident, Epstein refused to reply to them. After that incident, he was placed on suicide watch.\nSix days later on July 29, Epstein was taken off suicide watch. He had been moved into a special housing unit with another inmate (person living in jail). Epstein's close friends believed that Epstein was still happy while in jail. The jail told the Justice Department to regularly check Epstein's jail cell. They made sure that Epstein always had a cellmate nearby. Additionally, a guard would check his cell every 30\u00a0minutes for any suspicious activity. The Justice Department followed these rules everyday until they accidentally didn't on the night before his death. On August 9, Epstein's former cellmate was transferred out of Epstein's cell, but no replacement cellmate was brought in. Later in the evening, Epstein had not been checked every 30\u00a0minutes. The two guards that were supposed to supervise Epstein fell asleep for three hours and made false records of Epstein's activity. Two cameras in front of Epstein's cell also stopped working that night.\nEpstein killed himself by hanging on August 10, 2019, while at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. His body was found in his cell at 6:30\u00a0a.m. U.S Attorney General William Barr ordered an investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General in addition to the FBI investigation. Epstein was 66 years old.\nOn August 29, 2019, the judge decided to end the criminal investigation of Epstein. This is because it is no longer possible to investigate Epstein's criminal activity further due to his confirmed death.\nEver since his death, Internet memes have appeared in many forms, all stating that \"Epstein didn't kill himself\".

He then invented the one-design boat. He wanted yacht racing to show just skill at sailing with all boats to be the same. He found some other people who agreed with him and they decided on a design for the new boat. They decided to call the boat 'The Water Wag'. The Water Wag Club is still in D\u00fan Laoghaire harbour (near Dublin, Ireland), and they race every Wednesday evening during the Summer. \nThe idea was quickly taken by sailors in Ireland, England, India and South America. \nIn 1893 the Solent One Design Class was one of the first dinghy classes designed in England. It quickly became popular with some of the best-known yacht owners in the Solent, Portsmouth and Southampton waters including Sir Philip Hunloke, the King's Yachtmaster. The class was sailed by the Royal Yacht Squadron and the Island Sailing Club in 1895. The only boat still afloat is Rosenn, formally Eilun, sail number 6. She is included in the National Register of Historic Vessels of the United Kingdom and is kept in Lymington.\nNow there are a many classes of sailing dinghies in use in yacht clubs around the world and it is a major Olympic sport.\nSailing.\nThere are two ways of competition in sailboat racing: One-Design and Handicap. In one-design racing, the first boat to finish wins the race but with handicap racing, time is added or subtracted from the finishing times to decide the winner.\nIn smaller boats like dinghy classes, the rules are very strict. Sometimes the boats may only be produced by one manufacturer. An example is the Olympic Laser dinghy which is one of the most popular sailing dinghies in the world. But others, like the Optimist dinghy, may be built by anyone and some are home built. The Optimist dinghy is also very popular all over the world. However, the measurements are very strict. A boat like the Olympic 470 dinghy may only be built by certain licenced manufacturers.\nHandicapping rules.\nOther sailboats race with handicap rules. Handicap rules include Portsmouth Yardstick, International Offshore Rule (IOR), the International Measurement System (IMS), International Rating Certificate (IRC) and Americap."}

Richard Parker is the younger brother of Benjamin'Uncle Ben' Parker, he is married to Mary Parker whose maiden name is Fitzpatrick and the father of Peter Parker. Since the first issue Peter was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben but it didn't explain where his parents were. In their first appearance in a flashback it is revealed that they were murdered by the supervillain Albert Malik also known as the Red Skull. In comics from the 1990's it is revealed that Richard Parker was recruited into the CIA by Nick Fury , that he was pretending to be a Russian double agent and that he and his wife were killed in a plane crash caused by sabotage. Harry Osborne later creates robots that look just like Richard and Mary to trick Peter Parker into thinking that his parents are still alive and then reveals that they are not to destroy him. In the 2002 movie Spider-Man, Norman Osborne tells Peter Parker \"your parents must be proud\" and Peter tells him \"I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.\" Uncle Ben later tells Peter \"I know I'm not your father\" and Peter tells him \"then stop pretending to be\". At the end of the movie the Green Goblin tells Spider-Man that Peter has been like a son to him and that he has been like a father and Peter tells him \"I had a father, his name was Ben Parker.\" \nIn the 2012 movie The Amazing Spider-Man Dr Richard Parker is a scientist who disappeared after he and his wife left their son Peter Parker with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He is also responsible for the creation of the genetically engineered superspider that bites Peter and gives him his powers."}

It moved westward, passing just south of the Federated States of Micronesia. On February 18, the system became a tropical depression, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) initiated advisories on the system, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center giving the storm the identifier 02W. On February 20, Tropical Depression 02W strengthened into a tropical storm and received the name Wutip from the JMA.\nTyphoon warnings were issued in large parts of Micronesia, including Yap State.\nOn February 23, the storm was packing 1-minute sustained winds of 193\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), making it a Category typhoon, while also generating wave heights up to 12.5\u00a0m (41\u00a0ft), with wind gusts reaching 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph).

This also allowed Wutip to surpass Typhoon Higos from 2015 as the strongest February typhoon on record.\nOn February 24, Typhoon Wutip finished its eyewall replacement cycle and quickly re-intensified, resuming a trend of rapid intensification. Early on February 25, at 06:00 UTC, Wutip peaked as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), making Wutip the most powerful February typhoon recorded.\nOn February 27, 2019, at 9:00 UTC, the National Weather Service of Tiyan, Guam noted that Typhoon Wutip was located near 16.3\u00b0N and 139.4\u00b0E, about 410\u00a0miles west-northwest of Guam, and about 430\u00a0miles west-northwest of Saipan. Wutip's 1-minute sustained winds had also decreased to 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Wutip made a turn to the west-northwest while rapidly weakening, due to the wrong conditions. On February 28, Wutip weakened into a tropical depression. On the same day, Wutip was given the name Betty by the PAGASA, as the storm entered that agency's area of responsibility in the Philippine Sea. On March 1, Wutip made a clockwise loop to the west, before dissipating on the next day. \nImpact.\nDamages in Guam and Micronesia were at $3.3 million.\nOn Guam, Civil defense officials warned that the island was expected to experience tropical storm force winds between 64\u201372\u00a0km/h (40\u201345\u00a0mph) and rainfall totals of up to 6\u00a0inches (15.24 centimeters), and they advised the residents of Guam residents to stay indoors until the storm had passed. Wutip caused power outages across the island when it passed through the area on February 23.\nBack on Federated States of Micronesia, it passed over Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Yap states in the Federated States of Micronesia from February 19\u201322 as a Category 2 typhoon with sustained wind speeds of more than 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).

A proper landing on the lunar south pole would make India the 4th country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the space agencies of the USA, USSR, and China. The mission landing was expected on 7 September 2019 at 01:55\u00a0AM IST (6 September 2019, 20:25 UTC) but crashed when it lost communication at a 2100\u00a0metre altitude.\nHistory.\nOn 12 November 2007, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and ISRO agreed to work together on the Chandrayaan-2 project. ISRO would be in charge of the orbiter and rover, while Roscosmos was to build the lander. The design of the spacecraft was completed in August 2009, with scientists of both countries conducting a joint review.\nAlthough ISRO finalised the payload for Chandrayaan-2 on schedule, the mission was moved to 2016 because Russia was unable to build the lander on time. When Russia decided it would not be able to build a lander by 2015, India decided to develop the lunar mission on its own.\nThe spacecraft's launch had been scheduled for March 2018, but was delayed. Two of the lander's legs got minor damage during one of the tests in February 2019, making the launch date even later.\nGoals.\nThe main goals of Chandrayaan-2 are to demonstrate the ability to soft-land on the lunar surface and operate a robotic rover on the surface. Studies of lunar topography,mineralogy, elemental abundance, the lunar exosphere, and signatures of hydroxyl and water ice are the scientific goals. The orbiter will survey the lunar surface and help to prepare 3D maps of it. The onboard radar will also survey the surface while studying the water ice in the lunar south pole and thickness of the Lunar soil on the surface."}

The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 2016.\nFirst house.\nSunninghill Park was originally part of Windsor Forest until 1630, when King Charles I granted it to Thomas Carey. The first significant house was built on the estate in the late Georgian period in the early 19th century, being a stucco building of two stories with later additions.\nIt served as the headquarters of the American Ninth Air Force from November 1943 to September 1944. The Crown Estate Commissioners purchased the property from Philip Hill in 1945. The main house was to be occupied by Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and her future husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, after their wedding in November 1947. However, the house burned down on 30 August 1947 before their wedding, so they rented Windlesham Moor instead. In the mid-1960s, the site was considered for a new home for Princess Margaret.\nSecond house.\nIn 1986, the walled garden of was purchased from the Crown Estate Commissioners on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. Construction commenced on a two-storey red brick house the following year, for it to be the home of the Duke and Duchess of York and was completed in 1990.\nFollowing the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, it was announced that the Duke of York was to be designated her former home Royal Lodge, Windsor instead. The Duke of York and his former wife shared the family's home until 2004, when he moved to the Royal Lodge, the refurbishment of which was funded by taking out a mortgage on Sunninghill Park. The Duchess of York moved out in 2006. \nThe house fell into an increasing state of disrepair. By 2009, it had \"doors hanging open, weeds sprouting through the terrace paving, windows broken, grass growing through the cover over the empty swimming pool, peeling paintwork and a general air of dereliction.\" In July 2009, Bracknell Forest Borough Council were said to be considering seizing the property under the Housing Act 2004 and using it as a homeless shelter, following several reported break-ins. In 2013 the owner was granted planning permission to demolish it and replace it with a larger house, and in 2014, photos showed the former royal home appeared to be seriously dilapidated. Demolition was temporarily halted when more than 100 bats were found roosting under its roof, before its actual demolition."}

It was used until 1967.\nMonowi's peak years were in the 1930s, when it had 150 people living there. Like many other small communities in the Great Plains, its younger residents moved to cities that were growing and had better jobs. During the 2000 census, the village had only two people; only one married couple, Rudy and Elsie Eiler, lived there. Rudy died in 2004. This made his wife the only remaining resident. She acts as mayor, giving herself a liquor license and paying taxes to herself. She is required to make a municipal road plan every year in order to get state funding for the village's four streetlights.\nGeography.\nThe United States Census Bureau says that the village has a total area of . All land of it is land. The village is in the far eastern part of Boyd County, in the northeastern part of Nebraska. It is between the Niobrara River and the bigger Missouri River.

In the Treaty of New Echota, May 23, 1836, the northern border of the Cherokee Nation's land was set as the southern border of the Osage lands. When Congress passed the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act on May 30, 1854, it set the southern border of the Kansas Territory as the 37th parallel north. It was thought at the time that the Osage northern border was also the 37th parallel.\nThe Cherokees disagreed. They said that it was not the true boundary. They said that the border of Kansas should be moved north to make room for the actual border of the Cherokee land.\nThe situation happened during the troubles in Kansas leading up to the Civil War.\nUnder terms of Article 17 of the Treaty of 1866, the land was to be sold \"at not less than $1.25 an acre [$309/km2]\" for the first year. Then, it would be offered for sale at local land offices. In the first year, 156,848.47 acres (635\u00a0km2) were sold. 277,830.89 acres (1,124\u00a0km2) were given to land offices during the summer of 1879."}

Geographically it mostly has broad rolling landscape located between the Flint Hills to the west and includes the Ozarks to the southeast. Some notable towns there include Pittsburg, Parsons, Coffeyville, Independence, Chanute, Fort Scott, and Iola.\nThe first people to live there were some Native American tribes. Others included frontier towns that relied on cattle ranching and mining. They were hurt by violence over the issue of slavery. This happened both before and during the American Civil War (see Bleeding Kansas). The most common type of mining in Southeast Kansas was coal mining. This contributed to the amount of coal found. It also contributed to the quality and thickness of coal in Southeast Kansas. Southeast Kansas has one of the well-made recreations of early life in the United States Army at Fort Scott National Historic Site. "}

The first ever usage of the word \"nerd\" is in the year 1950 in the children's book If I Ran the Zoo by Dr. Seuss where it is one of the fictional animals the narrator would put in the zoo if he were running it. An article of Newsweek Magazine published in 1951 said that the word \"nerd\" was used as a synonym for the slang word \"square\" which was at the time a popular pejorative. By the 1960's the phrase \"nerd\" meaning someone who was intelligent but strange and antisocial especially if this person were interested in science-fiction was used throughout the United States and even in Scotland. In the 1970's it became extremely common to use the phrase \"nerd\" because it was routinely used in the television sitcom Happy Days. People labeled as nerds tend to be bullied in school more often than others are. In 1984, there was a movie called Revenge of the Nerds as a social commentary. A number of fictional characters such as Dilton Doiley, Peter Parker, Milhouse Van Houten and Hermione Granger are sometimes described as nerds."}

He is a theologian, human rights activist, Director of the Hilltop Empowerment Centre, consultant, lecturer and author.\nLife.\nRommel Roberts grew up in Mafeking (today: Mahikeng, North-West Province, South Africa), where he was confronted with the effects of apartheid as a child.\nHis father was white, and his mother Maureen Roberts, a qualified nurse and the only medical specialist for the surrounding townships, was of Indian descent and thus classified as non-white according to the categories of apartheid, and so the family was exposed to diverse discrimination. Rommel grew up with seven siblings.\nRommel Roberts graduated from High School in Cape Town and then studied theology and philosophy at St. Joseph's Theological Institute near Pietermaritzburg.\nAfter his studies he went back to Cape Town, and in the following years committed himself against apartheid working in various human rights groups and organising non-violent actions. Many years he worked alongside .\nRommel Roberts was married to Celeste Santos, also a human rights activist, and they had a son and a daughter. They were divorced later.\nIn the years after Nelson Mandela's release, Roberts was involved in various projects to build up democratic and economic structures as well as taking care of returning exiles. In 1994 he was called to Mafeking to prepare and monitor the first general free elections, also to resolve conflicts in the then \u2018Homeland\u2019 \nSince 1995 Roberts has been director of the Hilltop Empowerment Centre in the Eastern Cape. He lives there with his wife Robin, with whom he has been married since 2002. They organize numerous projects aimed at education issues and improving the living conditions of people in rural areas.\nHe is involved in consultancy work with South African municipalities and government departments as well as occasionally guest lecturing at universities, his topics being community development including IT literacy, communication and conflict resolution.\nRommel Roberts is still politically active today and criticises corruption and lack of services as well as the unequal living conditions in today's South Africa.\nAnti-apartheid and political views.\nWhen Rommel Roberts came back to Cape Town after his studies in 1974 he was especially interested in working with children and young people. He came in contact with the Early Learning Centre (today Early Learning Resource Unit, ELRU, in Kewtown that was involved in caring for children and general community work.\u00a0 Kewtown was a township near Cape Town where mainly coloured people lived. So Rommel Roberts learned about the townships and informal settlements which emerged as a result of the apartheid government\u2019s policy to evict and resettle black and coloured people. Roberts got deeply involved in supporting those people who often lived in poor housing conditions, sometimes only in shacks or provisional shelters. And even these dwellings were not secure as the government often destroyed whole townships, e.g. the township Modderdam in 1977. Through his association with the South African Council of Churches, Rommel Roberts worked together with Bishop Desmond Tutu as his national development officer. Rommel Roberts\u00b4 tasks also included building up national and international support networks.\nRoberts worked\u00a0 in human rights groups organising campaigns against government oppression and cruel treatment. In the case of Modderdam, after legal interventions had failed, they organised the evacuation of about 10.000 people when their homes were demolished and people were threatened to be deported to the so-called \u2018homelands\u2019. The Apartheid policy was that Blacks were no real citizens of South Africa and had to live in remote so-called \u2018homelands\u2019 where there were no job opportunities. They could only live in South Africa temporarily, and in order to live in South Africa they had to have a \u2018Pass\u2019. The protest against these \u2018Pass Laws\u2019 was one of the key issues in the struggle against apartheid and has a long history. Together with others Roberts organised lots of campaigns, boycotts and protest marches. One of the famous actions was the Cathedral fast in the St. George\u2019s Cathedral in Cape Town where people fasted for more than 20 days before Easter in 1982 and which resulted in the suspension of the Pass Laws.\nBecause of his activities against apartheid Roberts was in prison several times.\nRoberts has always believed that real changes could only be brought about with non-violent means and so did not agree with the attitudes of ANC (African National Congress) and PAC (Pan Africanist Congress) in this point. During the 1980s, when the country became more and more insecure and violence increased, including the infamous practice of \u201cnecklacing\u201d , Roberts organised several peace conferences together with Bishop Tutu where they tried to bring\u00a0 together the various hostile factions\u00a0 and find a solution to end the violence.\nThe Quaker Peace Centre.\nIn 1974 Rommel Roberts joined the Quakers and has worked with Quakers since then. Mainly on his initiative the first Peace Centre in South Africa was founded in Cape Town in 1985, the Quaker Peace Centre in whose administration he is still active today. They then felt that a great deal of work was required in terms of reconciliation and general peacemaking.\nRommel Roberts is now involved in a special Quaker Peace Centre initiative speaking truth to power through the exposure of leadership corruption in the promotion of arms deals."}

This shows its function in the sentence, by way of some inflection. The inflectional change of verbs is called conjugation.\nDeclensions may apply to nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and articles to indicate number (e.g. singular, dual, plural), case (e.g. nominative case, accusative case, genitive case, dative case), gender (e.g. masculine, neuter, feminine), and a number of other grammatical categories.\nFor example, in English, if there is more than one \"boy\", the word must become \"boys.\" For example, \"My family has two girls and one \"boy\", but my wife's family has two girls and three \"boys\"\". The form \"boy\" is singular, meaning there is only one of the noun, and the form \"boys\" is plural, meaning there is more than one of the noun. You must know the noun's singular form if you want to find it in an English dictionary.\nAlso in English, a noun can change if it owns something. For example, if a toy belongs to one boy, the toy is the \"boy's\" toy, but if it belongs to two or more boys, it becomes the \"boys\"' toy. Both numbers of the noun have this word case, which is called the genitive case. Word case is when a word form changes depending on what part of the sentence it is."}
{"id": "704611", "revid": "7462169", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=704611", "title": "Grammatical gender", "text": "Grammatical gender is a way of organizing words in a language. It is a way of deciding the inflection, or change in form, that a word has. Some languages have grammatical gender, like Spanish and Arabic, but others do not, like Chinese, Japanese, and Estonian.\nIndo-European languages.\nProto-Indo-European, the supposed ancestor language of Indo-European languages, had three genders, masculine (male), feminine (female), and neuter (neutral).\nA word's gender decides how to say a word. For example, the German word for \"man\" is masculine (\"der Mann\"), the word for \"woman\" is feminine (\"die Frau\"), and the word for \"girl\" is neuter (\"das M\u00e4dchen\"). The gender of a word may not have connection with its biological sex in certain languages; it is instead a way to organize words grammatically. Many Indo-European languages, like Russian, German, and Latin, still have all three genders.\nSome Indo-European languages have lost the neuter gender and either replaced it or completely got rid of it. In French, all singular nouns are either masculine (\"the boy\" \"le gar\u00e7on\") or feminine (\"the girl\" \"la fille\"), but all plural nouns use the same articles (\"the boys\" \"les gar\u00e7ons\" and \"the girls\" \"les filles\"). \nIn Spanish, there are only masculine and feminine nouns, but they are usually marked by a vowel at or near the end. Most masculine nouns end with the vowel \"-o\", and most feminine nouns end with the vowel \"-a\". For animate (living) nouns, the gender of the noun is always connected to its biological gender. For example, a male dog is \"perro\", and a female dog is \"perra\". If the gender is unknown, the noun is automatically masculine. In plural forms, if at least one of the nouns is male, the plural noun must be masculine, even if most of the members are feminine, like in \"the friends\" \"los amigos\". However, if all of the members of a plural noun are female, the plural noun is feminine, as in \"las amigas\".\nEnglish has three genders, but most nouns are not marked by gender. However, the genders of pronouns must match the biological sex of animate nouns. Males must be masculine, and females must be feminine. All plural and inanimate (non-living) nouns must be neuter. Some linguists call English's gender system to represent \"natural gender\".\nOther languages.\nIn Chinese, words have no grammatical gender, but there are still three gendered pronouns. The masculine pronoun is written as \u4ed6, the feminine is \u5979, and the neuter is \u5b83. Even though all three are written in a different Chinese character, they are all still pronounced exactly the same: \"t\u0101\" in Mandarin. That is why many Chinese learners of English do not use English pronouns correctly. In some contexts, if the gender is unknown, the pronoun will be written in pinyin as \"ta\" even if the rest of the document is written in Chinese characters.\nIn Japanese, grammatical gender is not used since people are usually referred to by name and/or title, rather than a pronoun. However, men and women are expected to use different pronouns. For example, women are supposed to say \"watakushi\", \"watashi\", or \"atashi\" to speak in the first person, but men usually say \"watashi\" to speak politely and \"boku\" or \"ore\" to speak plainly."}

To honour his late father, John Graves Simcoe enlisted as an Ensign in the British Army.\nMilitary service.\nJohn Graves Simcoe was then sent to Boston in the 1770s on the eve of the American Revolution. Simcoe fought for the British Empire against the Rebels during the Siege of Boston. Simcoe was then promoted to captain. Captain John Graves Simcoe then fought for the Empire against the Rebels in Pennsylvania in the Battle of Brandywine. Rumour has it that at Brandywine Simcoe commanded his men not to shoot at a number of fleeing rebels one of whom was George Washington. Simcoe wanted to raise a Black Loyalist regiment made entirely of freed slaves. Instead, Simcoe was asked to replace Robert Rogers as the commander of the Queen's Rangers. Lieutenant-Colonel John Graves Simcoe, Commander of the Queen's Rangers participated in several important battles of the Revolutionary War. Simcoe was at one point captured by the French and later freed by the Rangers. Simcoe also tried to expose Washington's Culper spy ring. Simcoe was shot in the Battle of Yorktown and sent back to England where he wrote a history of the revolutionary war from a British perspective.\nPolitics.\nSimcoe got married to Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim and he was elected to the House of Commons as a supporter of Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. Simcoe supported banning the slave trade and having Warren Hastings removed from his position as Governor of India. Simcoe also voted in favour of the Constitutional Act of 1791 which split Quebec into two provinces called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. Simcoe offered to lead the British in their war with Spain but instead he was named Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Simcoe was opposed to slavery and wanted to get rid of it. Because Simcoe wanted to abolish slavery a group of Upper Canadians sold a woman named Chloe Cooley to Americans and forcibly dragged her onto a boat to the United States of America. Simcoe was horrified by the Chloe Cooley Incident and used it to justify abolishing slavery. Simcoe said \" The principles of the British Constitution are fundamentally at odds to that vile practice of slavery which Christianity condemns, when I assume the governorship of Upper Canada I shall never allow discrimination by dishonest practice against those of African, Indian or American descent.\" Because a number of people in the Legislative Assembly were slaveowners Simcoe wasn't able to ban Slavery outright. Instead Simcoe issued An Act to Prevent the Further Introduction of Slaves also known as the Act to Limit Slavery which said that from now on one who was born in Upper Canada could not be born a slave and it became illegal to buy or sell slaves. Since there were not that many slaves in Upper Canada Simcoe's law abolished slavery within his own lifetime. After that a lot of slaves fled the United States to Upper Canada where they would be free to escape giving rise to what became known as the Underground Railroad."}

Major countries included the British Empire, France, the Russian Empire, the United States, Italy, and Japan. Most of these countries would fight alongside each other again in World War II, except that Italy and Japan would fight alongside Germany instead.\nThe Allied Powers in Europe were already allies before the war began. Serbia was an ally of Russia, and Russia was an ally of Britain and France. The war started because the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia in 1914, which led to a chain reaction of countries declaring war on each other.\nAt first, the United States was neutral, it was not part of either side. However, after several acts made by Germany against the US, the US declared war on Germany in 1917 and would fight for the Allied Powers.\nRussia's campaign against the Central Powers went very poorly. Many Russian soldiers were poorly equipped and trained, many Russians were killed, and poverty and starvation became worse problems than before. Many Russians blamed Czar Nicholas II's poor leadership for Russia's problems, so he was overthrown and sent to exile. The Russian Provisional Government who replaced him also made many Russians upset because they promised that Russia would continue fighting the war. After the March Revolution that overthrew the Czar, communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin made a deal with Germany. The deal was that he would stop the fighting between Russia and Germany if they sent him to Russia to overthrow the government. Lenin's slogan for his communist government was \"peace, land, and bread\". This meant that the communist government promised no more fighting in the war, land redistribution so that everyone in Russia could have an equal amount of property, and that food would be plentiful. After the Communist Party took over Russia in the October Revolution, they fulfilled their promise to Germany and ended Russia's fighting in the war.\nIn World War II, Italy would join Germany in the Axis Powers because its leader, Benito Mussolini, had a similar ideology to Nazism. Japan was disappointed with the end of World War I because it did not gain as much as it wanted. Japan would also join the Axis Powers because it thought it would help the Japanese Empire grow faster than if it did with the Allies."}

There they agree to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven. God, observing their city and tower, felt and insulted and confused the humans so that they can no longer understand each other. He then scatters them around the world.\nSome modern scholars have associated the Tower of Babel with known structures, notably the Etemenanki, a ziggurat dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Marduk in Babylon.

But the League did not follow through, and Italy quit the League, made special deals with Britain and France and invaded Abyssinia. The crisis made the League look bad, and made Fascist Italy closer friends with Nazi Germany.\nBoth Italy and Ethiopia did not like each other. The League of Nations said:At places where there is not a single Italian national, a consul establishes himself in an area known as consular territory with a guard of about ninety men, for whom he claims jurisdictional immunity. This is an obvious abuse of consular privileges. The abuse is all the greater that the consul's duties, apart from the supplying of information of a military character, take the form of assembling stocks of arms, which constitute a threat to the peace of the country, whether from the internal or the international point of view."}

It uses barbarians to rule over barbarians or the people you conquered to rule over the people you conquered. \nIt was used in China between the 7th century and 10th century. It was used during the Tang Dynasty from 650s-740s. It was also used in the Song, Mongol Yuan, Ming dynasties. But then it was also called the \"Tusi system\" (). It ended around 1726. Then the Qing dynasty created a new system.\nOrigin of term.\nThe term \"Jimi\" was first seen in the annotation of \"Shiji\" quoted by Sima Zhen in a book from the Eastern Han era. It means that a man uses a reign to lead a horse. \nJimi roughly translates as \"loose reigns\". It was an indirect way to rule over people.\nIt is also known as Jimi fuzhou () or the loose-control administrative units, they were not commonly confused with Zhengzhou () or the regular administrative units.\nWhat is it?\nChina back then often conquered foreign lands. For example when China would conquer barbarians in the north, it would gain a lot of land. How does China govern so much land? They needed a way to govern these foreigners (or \"barbarians\"). \nChina tells one of the barbarians they conquered to rule over the land for them. That ruler would have to follow orders from China, pay money, and help with China's military. This is Jimi. \nThe jimi ruler would received instructions from the central authorities in China. They would pass their power to their first sons. \nEach year they would pay money to China (tribute). They helped with China's military.\nThere were three levels: the command (, like the central government), prefecture (, like a state) and county (). Together these were known as jimi fuzhou.\nExamples.\nThe Tang conquered the Gokturks and made two jimi governments (\"duhufu\" \u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c) in 658. They were around the Tarbagatai Mountains and Lake Balkhash. Sometimes the term was applied to military camps created within Tang China."}

Perhaps the most significant event was the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from 2014 to the present.\nWhat happened?\nChinese professor Zhang Weiwei first predicted an \"Arab Winter\" in his June 2011 debate with Francis Fukuyama. \"My understanding of the Middle East leads me to conclude that the west should not be too happy. It will bring enormous problems to American interest. It is called \"Arab Spring\" for now, and I guess it will soon turn to be the winter for the Middle East.\"\nIn early 2016, \"The Economist\" said the Winter was ongoing and \"worse than ever\".\nConsequences.\nAccording to the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, as of January 2014, the Arab Winter cost the Arab League $800 billion USD. In 2014, sixteen million people in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon were expected to need help.\nAccording to a study by the American University of Beirut, as of the summer of 2014, a quarter of a million died, and millions are refugees.\nPolitical columnist and commentator George Will said that as of early 2017, over 30,000 died in Libya, 220,000\u2013320,000 were killed in Syria, and 4 million refugees had fled the Syrian Civil War alone. \nThere is chaos and violence. So many people fled the Middle East and North Africa to Europe, it has resulted in the European migrant crisis. As a result, \"boat-people\", which was once commonly referred to Vietnamese boat people, became frequently used. These include refugees from Libya or Tunisia, escaping to the European Union across the Mediterranean Sea. Some European politicians fear the migrants might \"flood\" their shores. So many Europeans are working on laws to help manage the arrivals along their nations' borders."}

In Greece it is known as The Crisis (Greek: \u0397 \u039a\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b7). It started with sudden reforms and austerity measures. But this made people poor and lose money and land. \nThe Greek economy is in the longest recession of any advanced capitalist economy to date. It is even longer than the US Great Depression. Many well-educated Greeks left the country.\nA trade deficit means that a country is buying more than it produces, so it has to borrow from others. Both the Greek trade deficit and budget deficit rose from below 5% of GDP in 1999 to peak around 15% of GDP in the 2008\u20132009 periods. Greece was perceived as a higher credit risk alone than it was as a member of the Eurozone. Thus investors felt the EU would help out Greece.\nReports in 2009 of Greek government disorganization increased borrowing costs. Greece could no longer borrow to finance its trade and budget deficits at an affordable cost.\nThe Great Recession.\nThe Greek crisis was triggered by the Great Recession, which led the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP. Greece had high budget deficit (10.2% and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively). But at the same time it had high public debt to GDP ratio. Greece appeared to lose control of this ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009. Being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous monetary policy flexibility. \nInternal factors.\nIn January 2010, the Greek Ministry of Finance published the \"Stability and Growth Program 2010\". The report listed five main causes: poor GDP growth, government debt and deficits, budget compliance and data credibility. Causes found by others included excess government spending, current account deficits, tax avoidance and tax evasion."}
{"id": "704755", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=704755", "title": "Austerity", "text": "Austerity measures (political-economics) are government actions that try to reduce government budget deficits. They do this by spending less, increasing tax, both, or some other clever ways.\nAusterity measures are used by governments that find it difficult to pay their debts. The measures are meant to reduce the budget deficit by bringing government revenue closer to spending.\nIn most macroeconomic models, austerity policies generally increase unemployment as government spending falls. Decreased government spending reduces public and maybe private employment. Also, tax increases can reduce consumption by cutting household disposable income. Some say that reducing spending may result in a higher debt-to-GDP ratio because government expenditure itself is a part of GDP.\nFor example, after the Great Recession, austerity measures in many European countries were followed by increasing unemployment and debt-to-GDP ratios despite smaller budget deficits. When an economy is operating at or near capacity, higher short-term deficit spending (stimulus) can cause interest rates to rise. This results in a reduction in private investment. This then reduces economic growth. Where there is excess capacity, the stimulus can result in an increase in employment and output."}

The skies of Venus, Mars and Titan have been observed by space probes designed to land on the surface and send images back to Earth.\nExtraterrestrial skies seem to vary because of a number of reasons. An extraterrestrial atmosphere, if present, has a large bearing on visible characteristics. The atmosphere's density and chemical composition can contribute to differences in color, opacity (including haze) and the presence of clouds. Astronomical objects may also be visible and can include natural satellites, rings, star systems and nebulas and other planetary system bodies.\nFor skies that have not been directly or indirectly observed, their appearance can be simulated based on known factors, such as the position of astronomical objects relative to the surface and atmospheric composition.\nMercury.\nBecause Mercury has little or no atmosphere, a view of the planet's skies would be no different from viewing space from orbit. Mercury has a southern pole star, Alpha Pictoris. It is fainter than Earth's Polaris in the constellation Ursa Minor.\nThe Sun from Mercury.\nOn average, the visible diameter of the Sun on Mercury is 2.5 times as large as it appears from Earth, and its total brightness is more than 6 times as great. Because of the planet's orbit, the Sun's apparent diameter in the sky would vary from 2.2 times that from Earth to 3.2 times. The sun would be over ten-times brighter.\nDue to its slow rotation, a day on Mercury lasts around 176 Earth days.\nOther planets seen from Mercury.\nAfter the Sun, the second-brightest object in the Mercurian sky is Venus, which is much brighter there than for observers on Earth.\nThe Earth and the Moon are also very prominent in the sky of Mercury. and \u22121.2, respectively. All other planets are visible just as they are on Earth, but somewhat less bright at opposition.\nVenus.\nThe atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the Sun cannot be easily seen in the daytime sky, and the stars are not visible at night. Color images taken by the space probes suggest that the sky on Venus is orange. If the Sun could be seen from Venus's surface, the time from one sunrise to the next would be about 117 Earth days. Because of the rotation of Venus, the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east.\nAn observer above the clouds of Venus would circle the planet in about four Earth days, and see a sky in which the Earth and the Moon shine brightly. Mercury would also be easy to spot, because it is closer and brighter, and because its maximum elongation from the Sun is considerably larger than when observed from Earth.\nThe Moon.\nThe Moon's atmosphere is very thin so its sky is always black, as in the case of Mercury. However, the Sun is so bright that it is impossible to see stars during the daytime, unless the observer is well shielded from sunlight.\nThe Sun from the Moon.\nThe Sun looks the same from the Moon as it does from Earth's orbit, somewhat brighter than it does from the Earth's surface, and colored pure white, due to the lack of scattering and absorption in its very thin atmosphere.\nDue to the position and orbit of the moon, the Sun nearly always takes the same path through the Moon's sky over the course of a year. As a result, there are craters and valleys near the Moon's poles that never receive direct sunlight, and there may exist mountains and hilltops that are never in shadow.\nThe Earth from the Moon.\nAmong the most prominent features of the Moon's sky is Earth. Earth shows phases, just like the Moon does for observers on Earth. The phases, however, are opposite; when the observer on Earth sees the full Moon, the lunar observer sees a \"new Earth\", and vice versa. The full Earth glows over 50 times brighter than the full Moon at its brightest for the observer on Earth. Earth light reflected on the Moon's darker half is bright enough to be visible from Earth, and is known as known as earthshine.\nAs a result of the Moon's rotation, one side of the Moon (the \"near side\") is permanently turned towards Earth, and the other side, the \"far side\", mostly cannot be seen from Earth. This means, conversely, that Earth can be seen only from the near side of the Moon and would always be invisible from the far side.\nEclipses from the Moon.\nEarth and the Sun sometimes meet in the lunar sky, causing an eclipse. On Earth, one would see a lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a solar eclipse, when the Sun goes behind the Earth. Since the apparent diameter of the Earth is four times as large as that of the Sun, the Sun would be hidden behind the Earth for hours. Earth's atmosphere would be visible as a reddish ring.\nSolar eclipse shadows, when the Moon blocks sunlight to the Earth, on the other hand, would not be as spectacular for observers on the Moon viewing the Earth: the Moon's umbra nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would be barely visible. The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object away. Observers on the Moon with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot at the center of a less dark region (penumbra) traveling across the full Earth's disk. It would look essentially the same as it does to the Deep Space Climate Observatory, which orbits Earth at the L1 Lagrangian point in the Sun-Earth system, from Earth.\nIn summary, whenever an eclipse of some sort is occurring on Earth, an eclipse of another sort is occurring on the Moon. Eclipses occur for observers on both Earth and the Moon whenever the two bodies and the Sun align in a straight line.\nMars.\nMars has only a thin atmosphere; however, it is extremely dusty, and there is much light that is scattered about. The sky is thus rather bright during the daytime and stars are not visible.\nThe color of the Martian sky.\nCapturing accurate color images from Mars's surface is difficult. For many years, the sky on Mars was thought to be more pinkish than it is now believed to be.\nIt is now known that during the Martian day, the sky is a butterscotch color. Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is rose in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. This is the opposite of the situation on Earth. Twilight lasts a long time after the Sun has set and before it rises because of the dust high up in the atmosphere of Mars.\nOn Mars, the red color of the sky is caused by the presence of iron(III) oxide in the airborne dust particles. These particles are larger in size than gas molecules, so most of the light is scattered. Dust absorbs blue light and scatters longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow).\nThe Sun from Mars.\nThe Sun as seen from Mars is about as large as seen from Earth, and shines 40% of the light, approximately the brightness of a slightly cloudy afternoon on Earth.\nMars's moons as seen from Mars.\nMars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. From the Martian surface, Phobos is one-third to one-half the size of the Sun, while Deimos is barely more than a dot.\nDue to its orbit, Phobos rises in the west and sets in the east. Deimos rises in the east and sets in the west, like a \"normal\" moon, although its appearance to the naked eye would be star-like. Phobos and Deimos can both eclipse the Sun as seen from Mars, although neither can completely cover its disk and so the event is in fact a transit, rather than an eclipse.\nEarth from Mars.\nThe Earth is visible from Mars as a double star; the Moon would be visible alongside it as a fainter companion.\nVenus from Mars.\nVenus as seen from Mars would have an apparent magnitude of about \u22123.2.\nThe outer planets.\nCompared with their view from Earth, the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) would appear slightly brighter during opposition, but slightly dimmer during conjunction.\nThe skies of Mars's moons.\nFrom Phobos, Mars appears 6,400 times larger and 2,500 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from Earth. From Deimos, Mars appears 1,000 times larger and 400 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from Earth.\nThe Asteroid Belt.\nThe asteroid belt is sparsely populated and most asteroids are very small, so that an observer situated on one asteroid would be unlikely to be able to see another without the aid of a telescope. Some asteroids that cross the orbits of planets may occasionally get close enough to a planet or asteroid so that an observer from that asteroid can make out the disc of the nearby object without the aid of binoculars or a telescope.\nJupiter.\nAlthough no images from within Jupiter's atmosphere have ever been taken, artistic representations typically assume that the planet's sky is blue, though dimmer than Earth's, because the sunlight there is on average 27 times fainter, at least in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. The planet's narrow rings might be faintly visible from latitudes above the equator. Further down into the atmosphere, the Sun would be obscured by clouds and haze of various colors, most commonly blue, brown, and red. Although theories abound on the cause of the colors, there is currently no clear answer.\nFrom Jupiter, the Sun appears to be less than a quarter of its size as seen from Earth.\nJupiter's moons as seen from Jupiter.\nAside from the Sun, the most prominent objects in Jupiter's sky are the four Galilean moons. Io, the nearest to the planet, would be slightly larger than the full moon in Earth's sky, though less bright, and would be the largest moon in the Solar System as seen from Jupiter. The higher brightness of Europa would not overcome its greater distance from Jupiter, so it would not outshine Io. Ganymede, the largest moon and third from Jupiter, is almost as bright as Io and Europa, but appears only half the size of Io. Callisto, further out, would appear only a quarter the size of Io.\nNone of the surface features on Jupiter's moons would appear as prominent as the lunar maria do when the Moon is viewed from Earth. Dark and light patches would be visible on Io's surface due to the coloration of sulfur that covers Io, and the largest volcanoes would be designated by dark points, but the lack of large, contrasting features results in a poor view of it. Europa, however, would appear as a completely featureless white disc. Even when viewed from nearby, most spacecraft images use contrast enhancements to clearly show the cracks in the Europan ice. Vague dark and light patches would be visible on Ganymede, whereas Callisto is much too distant for any features to be made out.\nAll four Galilean moons stand out because of the swiftness of their motion, compared to the Moon. They are all also large enough to fully eclipse the Sun.\nJupiter's small inner moons appear only as star-like points except Amalthea, which can occasionally appear as large as Callisto. However, they would all be brighter than any star. The outer moons would be invisible except for Himalia, which would appear as a dim, star-like point to the naked eye only under favorable circumstances.\nThe skies of Jupiter's moons.\nNone of Jupiter's moons have more than traces of atmosphere, so their skies are black or very nearly so. For an observer on one of the moons, the most prominent feature of the sky by far would be Jupiter.\nBecause the inner moons of Jupiter are in synchronous rotation around Jupiter, the planet always appears in nearly the same spot in their skies. Observers on the sides of the Galilean satellites facing away from the planet would never see Jupiter, for instance.\nFrom the moons of Jupiter, solar eclipses caused by the Galilean satellites would be spectacular, because an observer would see the circular shadow of the eclipsing moon travel across Jupiter's face.\nSaturn.\nThe sky in the upper reaches of Saturn's atmosphere is blue, but the predominant color of its cloud decks suggests that it may be yellowish further down. The rings of Saturn are almost certainly visible from the upper reaches of its atmosphere. The rings are so thin that from a position on Saturn's equator, they would be almost invisible. However, from anywhere else on the planet, they could be seen as a spectacular arc stretching across half the celestial hemisphere.\nSaturn's moons would not look particularly impressive in its sky, as most are fairly small, and the largest are a long way from the planet. Even Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, appears only half the size of Earth's moon. In fact, Titan is the dimmest of Saturn's large moons due to its great distance and dimness; Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea are all brighter. Most of the inner moons would appear as bright, star-like points (with the exception of Janus, although most would shine brighter than any star. None of the outer moons would be visible except Phoebe which would be very dim.\nThe skies of Saturn's moons.\nSince the inner moons of Saturn are all in synchronous rotation, the planet always appears in the same spot in their skies. Observers on the sides of those satellites facing away from the planet would never see Saturn. In the skies of Saturn's inner moons, Saturn is an enormous object.\nThe rings from Saturn's moons.\nSaturn's rings would not be prominent from most of the moons. This is because the rings, though wide, are not very thick. The rings are edge-on and practically invisible from the inner moons. From the outer moons, starting with Iapetus, a more oblique view of the rings would be available, although the greater distance would make Saturn appear smaller in the sky; from Phoebe, the largest of Saturn's irregular moons, Saturn would appear only as big as the full Moon does from Earth. The best view of the rings may be from the inner moon Mimas, which is fairly near the rings. The co-orbitals Epimetheus and Janus would also get a good view. Tethys gets the next best view; Iapetus gets a good view of the rings and is more than any of the outer moons can claim.\nThe sky of Titan.\nTitan is the only moon in the Solar System to have a thick atmosphere. The Titanean sky is a light tangerine color. However, an astronaut standing on the surface of Titan would see a hazy brownish/dark orange color. As a consequence of its greater distance from the Sun and the thickness of its atmosphere, the surface of Titan receives only about of the sunlight Earth does \u2013 daytime on Titan is thus only as bright as twilight on the Earth. It seems likely that Saturn is permanently invisible behind orange smog, and even the Sun would be only a lighter patch in the haze, barely illuminating the surface of ice and methane lakes. However, in the upper atmosphere, the sky would have a blue color and Saturn would be visible. With its thick atmosphere and methane rain, Titan is the only celestial body other than Earth upon which rainbows on the surface could form. However, given the extreme thickness of the atmosphere in visible light, the vast majority of the rainbow would be in the infrared.\nThe sky of Enceladus.\nSeen from Enceladus, Saturn would have a visible diameter sixty times more than the Moon visible from Earth. Moreover, since Enceladus rotates synchronously with its orbital period and therefore keeps one face pointed toward Saturn, the planet never moves in the sky of Enceladus and cannot be seen from the far side of the satellite.\nSaturn's rings would be almost invisible, but their shadow on Saturn's disk would be clearly distinguishable. Like our own Moon from Earth, Saturn itself would show regular phases. From Enceladus, the Sun would have a diameter of only one-ninth that of the Moon as seen from Earth.\nAn observer located on Enceladus could also observe Mimas (the biggest satellite located inside Enceladus's orbit) transit in front of Saturn every 72 hours, on average. Its apparent size would be about the same size as the Moon seen from Earth. Pallene and Methone would appear nearly star-like. Tethys, visible from Enceladus's anti-Saturnian side, would reach a maximum apparent size, about twice that of the Moon as seen from the Earth.\nUranus.\nJudging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of Uranus is probably a light blue. It is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark.\nNone of Uranus's moons would appear as large as a full moon on Earth from the surface of Uranus, but the large number of them would present an interesting sight for observers hovering above the cloud tops. Unlike on Jupiter and Saturn, many of the inner moons can be seen as disks rather than star-like points; the moons Portia and Juliet can appear around the size of Miranda at times, and a number of other inner moons appear larger than Oberon. The outer irregular moons would not be visible to the naked eye.\nThe low light levels at such a great distance from the sun ensure that the moons appear very dim; the brightest, Ariel, would shine more than 100 times dimmer than the moon as seen from Earth. Meanwhile, the outer large moon Oberon would be only as bright as Venus despite its proximity.\nNeptune.\nJudging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of Neptune is probably an azure or sky blue, similar to Uranus'. As in the case of Uranus, it is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark.\nAside from the Sun, the most notable object in Neptune's sky is its large moon Triton, which would appear slightly smaller than a full Moon on Earth. It moves more swiftly than our Moon. The smaller moon Proteus would show a disk about half the size of the full Moon. An alignment of the inner moons would likely produce a spectacular sight. Neptune's large outer satellite, Nereid, is not large enough to appear as a disk from Neptune, and is not noticeable in the sky. The other irregular outer moons would not be visible to the naked eye.\nAs with Uranus, the low light levels cause the major moons to appear very dim.\nThe sky of Triton.\nTriton, Neptune's largest moon, has an atmosphere, but it is so thin that its sky is still black, possibly with some pale haze at the horizon. Because Triton orbits with synchronous rotation, Neptune always appears in the same position in its sky. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun for 82 years at a stretch, resulting in radical seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight.\nNeptune itself with a maximum brightness would be about that of the full moon on Earth. Due to its eccentric orbit, Nereid would vary considerably in brightness; its disk would be far too small to see with the naked eye. Proteus would also be difficult to resolve but, at its closest, would rival Canopus.\nTrans-Neptunian Objects.\nA trans-Neptunian object is any minor planet in the Solar System that orbits the Sun at a greater average distance than Neptune.\nPluto and Charon.\nPluto, accompanied by its largest moon Charon, orbits the Sun at a distance usually outside the orbit of Neptune except for a twenty-year period in each orbit.\nFrom Pluto, the Sun is point-like to human eyes, but still very bright, giving roughly 150 to 450 times the light of the full Moon from Earth. Nonetheless, human observers on Pluto would notice a large decrease in available light.\nPluto's atmosphere consists of a thin envelope of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide gases, all of which are derived from the ices of these substances on its surface. When Pluto is close to the Sun, the temperature of Pluto's solid surface increases, causing these ices to sublimate into gasses. This atmosphere also produces a noticeable blue haze that is visible at sunset and possibly other times of the Plutonian day.\nPluto and Charon are tidally locked to each other. This means that Charon always presents the same face to Pluto, and Pluto also always presents the same face to Charon. Observers on the far side of Charon from Pluto would never see the dwarf planet; observers on the far side of Pluto from Charon would never see the moon. Charon, as seen from Pluto's surface would be a very large object in the night sky.\nComets.\nThe sky of a comet changes dramatically as it nears the Sun. During closest distance, a comet's ices begin to sublime from its surface, forming tails of gas and dust, and a coma. An observer on a comet nearing the Sun might see the stars slightly obscured by a milky haze, which could create halo effects around the Sun and other bright objects.\nExtrasolar planets.\nFor observers on extrasolar planets, the constellations would differ depending on the distances involved. A consequence of observing the universe from other stars is that stars that may appear bright in our own sky may appear dimmer in other skies and vice versa.\nA planet around either \u03b1 Centauri A or B would see the other star as a very bright secondary.\nFrom a planet orbiting Aldebaran, 65 light years away, our Sun would be seen as an insignificant star between Ophiuchus and Scorpius. Constellations made of bright, distant stars would look somewhat similar (such as Orion and Scorpius) but much of the night sky would seem unfamiliar to someone from Earth. Even Orion would appear somewhat different; viewed from this position, Alnilam and Mintaka would appear to be on top of each other, thus reducing the belt to two stars. Also, Bellatrix would be much closer to the belt, making the \"chest\" of Orion somewhat smaller.\nStars.\nIf the Sun were to be observed from the Alpha Centauri system, the nearest star system to ours, it would appear to be as a star in the constellation Cassiopeia. Due to the proximity of the Alpha Centauri system, the constellations would, for the most part, appear similar.\nFrom further away, the Sun would be an average looking star in the constellation Serpens Caput. At this distance, most of the stars nearest to us would be in different locations to those in our sky, including Alpha Centauri, Sirius, and Procyon."}
