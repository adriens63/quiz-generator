Several 16th-century texts mention her, of which the earliest source is \"Padmavat\". \"Padmavat\" is an epic fictionalized poem written by Malik Muhammad Jayasi in 1540 CE. The Jayasi text describes her story as follows: Padmavati was an exceptionally beautiful princess of the Singhal kingdom (Sri Lanka). Ratan Sen, the Rajput ruler of Chittor Fort, heard about her beauty from a talking parrot named Hiraman. After an adventurous quest, he won her hand in marriage and brought her to Chittor. Alauddin Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi, also heard about her beauty, and laid siege to Chittor to obtain her. Many events occurred during the period of the siege, till the fort was finally taken. Meanwhile, Ratan Sen was killed in a duel with Devpal, the king of Kumbhalner, who was also enamoured with Padmavati's beauty. Before Alauddin Khalji could capture Chittor, Padmavati and her companions committed Jauhar (self-immolation) to protect their honour. After her sacrifice, the Rajput men died fighting on the battlefield.\nMany other written and oral tradition versions of her life exist in Hindu and Jain traditions. These versions differ from the Sufi poet Jayasi's version. For example, Rani Padmani's husband Ratan Sen dies fighting the siege of Alauddin Khalji, and thereafter she leads a jauhar. In these versions, she is characterised as a Hindu Rajput queen, who defended her honour against a Muslim invader.

He currently drives in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 17 Ford Fusion for Roush Fenway Racing. He has won the Nationwide Series championship in 2010 and 2011, and has been Rookie of the Year in both the Monster Energy Cup and Nationwide Series. \nRacing career.\nEarly years.\nStenhouse started racing when he was six, driving go-karts. He later moved in to sprint car racing, being named Rookie of the Year in a sprint car series in 2007. He also raced for former NASCAR driver Tony Stewart in 2007. Stenhouse signed a contract with NASCAR team Roush Fenway Racing in 2007, running in the ARCA Racing Series in 2008. In only his sixth stock car race, Stenhouse won for the first time at Kentucky Speedway. He won another race at Pocono Raceway and was running for the championship with Scott Speed before he and Speed crashed twice in the race so that both of them wouldn't win the championship.\nNASCAR.\nAfter running in the ARCA series, Stenhouse drove for Roush Fenway Racing in seven Nationwide Series races in 2009 with Greg Biffle, Colin Braun and Jamie McMurray completing the schedule. He qualified first at Iowa Speedway and ran all of the races in 2010, winning the Rookie of the Year award. The following year, he won the championship. He won the championship again in 2012. After the final race of 2012, Stenhouse was disappointed because he didn't win the race.\nStenhouse made his first Sprint Cup start in 2011, driving in place of Trevor Bayne at Wood Brothers Racing. He did not run another race until the next year, when he ran four races for Roush Fenway Racing. \nHe ran all of the races in 2013, winning the series' Rookie of the Year award. He came back for a full season the following year but did not qualify for one race due to a new way of qualifying. In 2015, Stenhouse had some sponsorship problems, leading to a 25th place finish in the point standings. His performance went along with the team not doing as well as before. The following year, Stenhouse finshed a career-best second at Bristol Motor Speedway; however, his crew chief was suspended the following week for a steering wheel problem. Overall, it was the best year of his Cup career. \nStenhouse finally broke through to Victory Lane in the Cup Series in 2017, winning at Talladega Superspeedway in his 158th career start. A couple months later, he won again, this time at Daytona International Speedway. Both of his wins came on restrictor plate tracks. He also made the NASCAR Playoffs for the first time, making it through the Round of 16 before being cut in the Round of 12.\nPersonal life.\nStenhouse started dating another NASCAR driver, Danica Patrick, in 2013. The two split in late 2017."}

The Show stars Rhea Sharma and Avinesh Rekhi and is the sequel to the series Diya Aur Baati Hum. Neelu Vaghela, Ashok Lokhande, and Kanika Maheshwari reprise their roles from that series.\nPLOT / STORY.\nThe story is based o the life of the children of Sooraj and Sandhya, focusing on their daughter, Kanak. Her grandmother Bhabho ignores and looks down upon Kanak because according to her, Kanak is to blame for her (Kanak's) parents' death, but later upon realising her love for Kanak, Bhabho accepts her as family. Later, Kanak gets married to a superstitious but good-hearted gentleman, named Uma Shankar. He is a blind believer in morals taught by his greedy and hypocrite maternal aunt, Nanda Devi. Kanak sets off on a journey with Uma Shankar, who is her perfect opposite, to teach him the greatest moral of life - humanity - while she is criticized by Palomi and repeatedly harmed by Maasi Saa, and later, her lewd son, Aditya. In the process, she herself falls in love with Uma after establishing herself as the perfect wife for him. In a subplot taking place in Bangkok, Uma and Kanak plot to expose Maasi Saa and Aditya, and prove that Palomi is alive. They succeed in doing so and are about to live happily until Uma shockingly marries Meera Mittal, daughter of a rich businessman for some unknown reason, ditching Kanak.\nThe story then takes a two-year leap and Kanak eventually reappears in Uma's life, who is now shown as a successful business tycoon. After a lot of misunderstandings, it is revealed that Uma still loves Kanak and he was actually blackmailed and forced into marrying Meera to save his sister Suman's life. Meera gets mad with jealousy and vows to destroy Kanak\u2019s life. She alongside Aditya tries many heinous ways to separate the duo including attempting to marry off Kanak to a man who is also after her, but fails every time and eventually gets arrested thanks to a cunning plan made by Kanak. Aditya also realises his mistake and has a change of heart, becoming loyal towards his brother. Kanak gets rid of her hatred towards Uma and the couple are united again. It is then that Maasi Saa comes out of jail with the same evil intention of decimating the protagonists.\nSaras (Uma's sister) meanwhile suffers an unfortunate miscarriage, and seeing Uma's grief over the matter Kanak with the help of Aditya launches a Bike Ambulance so that every emergency patient gets admitted to the hospital as quickly as possible. But this noble idea creates many enemies for Uma and Kanak from the very outset and Dr. Parag, Dean of Pratistha Medical College joins hands with Maasi Saa to cancel Uma's license so that he can use the idea to flourish his own Medical College and take the credit wholly upon himself. Kanak decides to study Paramedicals and become a doctor herself to save the license from being cancelled and no one can label her as amateur when she treats any patient. After facing several hurdles and hindrances in the college set up by Dr. Parag himself, she at last succeeds in removing the mask out of Dr. Parag's face, unveiling his true nature in front of the public and gets him behind bars. It is revealed before that Maasi Saa was ill-treated by Dr. Parag while in jail, and she was planning for revenge ever since she got out of jail. She later stops plotting against Uma and Kanak and becomes kind towards them.\nUma at this time receives a fake call and gets attacked by some goons who also trashes his Bike Ambulance. He recovers some months later, but loses his memory and to everyone's surprise turns into that same superstitious person he used to be before. He asks Kanak to either choose him or to pursue the Paramedics course as he is against the idea of her studying. However, Kanak chooses to continue her dream of becoming a doctor. Uma supports her decision and Aditya then reveals that it was Uma's plan all along to infuse some confidence and passion inside Kanak which she was lacking hitherto, and that he never lost his memory. With her husband at her side, the story finally ends on a happy note as Kanak sets off for her new career with the blessings of Bhabo and other elders.\nRemakes.\nBecause of it's Popularity it is remaded in several language .

The moral commitment usually results in action and is not a matter of passive feeling or mere recognition. When someone recognizes a duty, that person theoretically commits himself to its fulfillment without considering their own self-interest. This is not to suggest that living a life of duty entirely precludes a life of leisure; however, its fulfillment generally involves some sacrifice of immediate self-interest. Typically, \"the demands of justice, honor, and reputation are deeply bound up\" with duty.\nCicero discusses the concept of duty in his work \u201cOn Duty\". There, he suggests that duties can come from four different sources:\nOther uses of the word have sprung from the root idea of obligation, a concept involved in the notion of duty. For example, the concept is used to describe the services performed by a minister of a church, by a soldier, or by any employee or servant.\nMany schools of thought have debated the idea of duty. Many assert mankind's duty on their own terms, but some philosophers have absolutely rejected a sense of duty.\nDuty has to be accepted and understood on the basis of one's foundation of sense and knowledge. Therefore, duty and its manifestations vary with values from culture to culture. On one hand duty may be seen as terms of reference, job description, or behavior - and it is all of that ... but duty is not only about doing things right, it is about doing the right thing."}

Toppings are food added to pizza, like pepperoni, cheese or sausage. Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. The food that came before pizza was probably focaccia (a flatbread to which toppings were added). The word \"pizza\" was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta, Italy. The word came later in parts of Central and Southern Italy.\nThe innovation that led to flatbread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous.\nModern pizza was developed in Naples, Italy, when tomato was added to focaccia in the late 18th century. Pizza, though, was mainly eaten \"in\" the country of Italy.\nBy the late 18th century, it was common for the poor in and around Naples to add the tomato to their yeast-based flatbread. That's when pizza began.\nPizzas need to be baked at temperatures of 200250\u00a0\u00b0C. Not many household ovens could reach such temperatures before the late 1800s. Because of this, pizza was made at home, and then given to the town bakery to bake.\nIn June 1889, Raffaele Esposito, a chef from Naples, created the \"Margherita\" in honour of Queen Margherita. It was the first pizza to include cheese. Most pizzas include cheese as a topping.\nPizza first made its appearance to the United States in the 19th century when Italian immigrants came to the country. It was very popular with Italian people in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and St. Louis.\nAllied troops in Italy came to enjoy pizza and other Italian foods during World War II.\nThe first printed reference to the word \"pizza\" in the U.S. was in 1904 in \"The Boston Journal\"."}

Most of his life is unknown, but historians do have some information about him.\n(Simon Kananaios; kanna'i, \"the Jealous (or Zealous) One\"): \nOne of the Twelve Apostles. This Simon was also named \"the Canaanite\" (Matthew 10:4; Mark 3:18 the King James Version) or \"the Cananean\" (Matthew 10:4; Mark 3:18 the Revised Version (British and American)) or \"Zelotes\" (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13 the King James Version) or \"the Zealot\" (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13 the Revised Version (British and American)).\nAccording to the \"Gospel of the Ebionites\" or\" Gospel of the Twelve Apostles\" (of the 2nd century and mentioned by Origen) Simon received his call to the apostleship along with Andrew and Peter, the sons of Zebedee, Thaddaeus and Judas Iscariot at the Sea of Tiberias (compare Matthew 4:18-22; see also Hennecke, Neutestamentliche Apokryphen, 24-27).\nAlthough Simon, like the majority of the apostles, was probably a Galilean, the designation \"Cananaean\" is regarded as of political rather than of geographical significance (compare Luke's rendering). The Zealots were a faction, headed by Judas of Galilee, who \"in the days of the enrollment\" (compare Acts 5:37; Luke 2:1,2) bitterly opposed the threatened increase of taxation at the census of Quirinius, and would have hastened by the sword the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy.\nSimon has been identified with Simon the brother of Jesus (Mark 6:3; Matthew 13:55), but there also are reasons in favor of identifying him with Nathanael.\nThus (1) all the arguments adduced in favor of the Bartholomew-Nathanael identification (see NATHANAEL) can equally be applied to that of Simon-Nathanael, except the second. But the second is of no account, since the Philip-Bartholomew connection in the Synoptists occurs merely in the apostolic lists, while in John it is narrative. Further, in the Synoptists, Philip is connected in the narrative, not with Bartholomew but with Andrew.\n(2) The identity is definitely stated in the Genealogies of the Twelve Apostles (see NATHANAEL). Further, the \"Preaching of Simon, son of Cleopas\" (compare Budge, II, 70) has the heading \"The preaching of the blessed Simon, the son of Cleopas, who was surnamed Judas, which is interpreted Nathanael, who became bishop of Jerusalem after James the brother of our Lord.\" Eusebius (Historia Ecclesiastica, III, xi, 32; IV, xxii) also refers to a Simon who succeeded James as bishop of Jerusalem and suffered martyrdom under Trajan; and Hegesippus, whom Eusebius professes to quote, calls this Simon a son of Cleopas.\n(3) The invitation of Philip to Nathanael (compare John 1:45) was one which would naturally be addressed to a follower of the Zealots, who based their cause on the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy.\n(4) As Alpheus, the father of James, is generally regarded as the same as Clopas or Cleopas (see JAMES), this identification of the above Simon Nathanael, son of Cleopas, with Simon Zelotes would shed light on the reason of the juxtaposition of James son of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes in the apostolic lists of Luke and Acts, i.e. they were brothers."}

The Show Stars Aishwarya Roy and Antara as The Main Female Protagonists and Indrajeet Bose as The Main Male Antagonist and bhaswar chatterjee as the male lead. It replaced the popular show Stree starring Neel Bhattacharya and Neha Amandeep in the lead roles.The show will go off air on 30th November 2018 and will get replaced byRanu Pelo Lottery starring Krushal Ahuja and Bijoylakshmi Chatterjee in the lead roles.\nPlot.\nIt narrates the story of a six-year-old girl named Amloki, who was born deaf and dumb.\nAmloki hails from a poor family. Her father,Ratan is a gambler and steals jewelry while her mother runs the family by preparing jaggery at daytime and acting in Jatra at night. The sole reason for her mother\u2019s existence is Amloki. She believes that someday her daughter will be cured. However, destiny has its own plans. Amloki loses her mother suddenly.\nHer responsibility now solely rests on the shoulders of her irresponsible father. But instead of taking care of his special daughter, her father shoves off his duties and makes a quick escape. Now how Amloki survives all by herself in this cruel world and takes her truant father to task and makes him realize his mistakes.\nAmloki's mother Chandana who is in fact daughter of the influential GuhaThakurtas meets with an accident and loses her memory. However she is rescued by her cousin Mohana. Mohana then takes her to her maternal home of the GuhaThakurtas where in addition to Chandana's parents, her uncle and aunt and their two kids (Mohana and Nilay) reside along with Nilay's wife Baisakhi who is a shrewd manipulator.\nChandana's family had earlier estranged her upon her marriage to Ratan who they knew was a good for nothing thug. However seeing the dire situation of Chandana, they welcome her back and their parental love comes to the fore. However Chandana can't seem to remember anything including her parents. \nIn a separate development, Mohana rescues Amlaki from an orphanage and takes her to the GuhaThakurtas in a bid to adopt her as she is biologically unfit to reproduce. Amlaki is ecstatic upon seeing her real mother Chandana in the GuhaThakurta household. However she is unable to communicate this because of her inabilities. Ratan disguises himself as Ratnadeep Sengupta and under this guise meets Mohana to charm her as he believes she is the key to the GuhaThakurta household.He shows himself to be a simplistic classy and sophisticated gentleman and Mohana instantly falls in love with him unaware of his true intentions. Mohana's parents and Baisakhi conspire against Amlaki and get her deported from the household to a remote location. Mohana and Nilay are furious upon knowing this and vow to get Amlaki back. In the meanwhile, police comes to the GuhaThakurta household and arrests Nabakumar GuhaThakurta for his alleged role in the kidnapping of Amlaki.Amlaki is rescued and brought back to the house while Ratan in a bid to marry Mohana visits the family and is shocked to find Chandana and Amlaki there. However he is relieved to find that Chandana has lost all her memory and can't seem to identify him. Although Amlaki recognises him, she is unable to point this out to the family members.\nTaking advantage of Mohana's naivety Ratnadeep gets closer to her and is about to announce his decision to marry her when he comes to know that Chandana's father Nabakumar GuhaThakurta is the main owner and thus Chandana is the heir to the GuhaThakurta household and not Mohana whose father is just a mere employee. Sensing this opportunity he woos Chandana and tricks Nabakumar into thinking he is a perfect match for his daughter. Charmed by Ratan, Nabakumar agrees to this marriage as Ratan falsely informs them that Chandana's legitimate husband is dead. Mohana is shocked by this decision. To cover his tracks, Ratan lies that Amloki is actually a kleptomaniac and has a tendency of stealing things. Chandana is offended but decides to keep mum. Nabakumar insists on meeting Ratan's family members despite the latter's reluctance. Ratan asks his sister and her husband to play the role of his parents and sets up few miscreants disguised as genuine local people to sing praises about him.However Baisakhi catches onto Ratan and goes to Mohana with this information but Mohana outright dismisses her and even insults. This causes an incensed Baisakhi to keep shut and she vows not to let anyone know the truth but instead let them suffer. Mohana,on the other hand, is deeply in love with Ratnadeep and can't imagine a life without him. She is hell bent on marrying him by hook or by crook. She makes several unsuccessful attempts to stop Chandana and Ratnadeep from marrying. However she is caught and she is forcefully isolated from the marriage. On the day of marriage, Mohana thinks of dissuading Chandana by reminding her of her deceased husband which she has forgotten but Sudakshina stops her from reaching Chandana's room. Ratan persuades Chandana to go to a beauty parlour so that he can meanwhile steal the jewelry and blame it on Amloki. Chandana leaves for the parlour and Ratan steals the jewelry. Amloki is frightened at the prospect of Chandana marrying Ratan once again as she has been witness to the cruelty imposed to Chandana firsthand. However family members fail to perceive this and become bewildered at Amloki's attempts to sabotage the marriage and simply think this to be a manifestation of the apparent dislike which Amloki harbours towards Ratnadeep.\nAmloki catches Ratan stealing the jewelry and attempts to stop him. However she is no match for him as he gives it away to his sister and her husband. An aggrieved Amloki runs after the cab ferrying the both of them and the stolen jewellery and while doing so meets with an accident. On being caught entering the residence from the backgate Ratnadeep lies that Amloki stole all the jewellery and ran away. Nilay finds it to be a tad bit suspicious but keeps mum anyway. Chandana on returning from parlour is shocked to find Amloki accused of stealing. Her maternal instincts cry out to her that Amloki is in pain and she leaves the marriage venue while asking Mohana to delay the marriage while she searches for Amloki. Mohana on the other hand uses this opportunity to get married to Ratnadeep on Baisakhi's advice. After half of the marriage is over, the truth is out but Mohana lies that Chandana left the marriage asking for Mohana to be happy. Ratnadeep refuses to marry her but Baisakhi threatens him with dire consequences of revealing his truth to the family members. This causes Ratan to agree to the marriage. Chandana discovers Amloki is at a nursing home and after admitting her calls Mohana only to know that she has taken Ratnadeep for herself. Chandana faints but is rescued by Dr.Gaurav Sen, her potential love interest and her ex-fiance who is also the owner of the nursing home. At the last episode, Chandana recalls her old memories before the accident and when she sees Amloki, she shouts loudly saying \"Amloki\". Amloki was able to talk and hear. When Amloki said Maa to Chandana, Chandana was unable to believe that her daughter can talk as well as hear. Like that, the story ends."}

For the sake of illustration, the Czech Paralympic Committee has now gotten less money than last year's sledge hockey players, and it has to be divided into a lot of sports.\" The team could not buy time to use ice at skating rinks to train much before their final qualifying competition in Sweden. They also could not buy new equipment like sledges, hockey sticks or hockey gloves. To make sure they were ready to qualify, the captain thought the team needed around 1 million Czech Koruna () to pay for all the costs of training and traveling. Because they could not get funding from the government, players had to ask individuals to support them financially.\nThe team went to Nagano to compete in a tournament in February 2018 to prepare for the Games.\nQualification.\nJapan, Sweden and the Czech Republic were the last 3 teams that were able to go to the 2018 Games.

The team from Spain had 4 people. They included 2 snowboarders and 2 skiers. Blind skier Jon Santacana and guide skier Miguel Galindo Garces competed at the Paralympics before in 2002, 2006, 2010 and the 2014. Astrid Fina Paredes went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Snowboarder V\u00edctor Gonz\u00e1lez will be going to his first Paralympic Games.\nTeam.\nSpain sent 4 people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics. They were snowboards and alpine skiers. The team went to an event in Madrid on 26 February 2018 in Madrid. After the event, they went to South Korea.\nThe table below contains the list of members of people (called \"Team Spain\") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.\nHistory.\nTraditionally, the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden have been the best countries at the Winter Paralympics. Spain has not sent many people, and has not won many medals. One of the reasons is that there are not many places to ski, and it is very expensive. This discourages people from trying winter sports. Paralympic sports are also treated the same as women's sports in Spain. They are hidden away, and the media gives little coverage to the sporting accomplishments of its elite Paralympic sportspeople. While Olympic people have guaranteed money because of Plan ADO, Paralympic people get much less money from Plan ADOP. The money they get is also much less secure, changing from year to year. This makes it difficult for Spanish Paralympic people to plan in advance their practice and competition calendar. Olympic people get money for the year. Paralympic people only get money for a month. The next month, they may not get any money from Plan ADOP. While Spain has a lot of people with disabilities, only 0.5% have a sports license.\nThere were some issues related to clothing making Joma sponsoring the Winter Paralympic team. The company already sponsored the 2018 Spanish Winter Olympic team. This started during preparations for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Joma wanted to provide clothing for only some members of the Spanish team going to Rio de Janeiro. They did not want to provide clothes for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Summer Paralympics. The company cited a lack of commercial visibility for the Paralympic Games as the reason they wanted to do this. While Joma was not providing clothing for all team members for all parts of the Summer Paralympics, the company created advertising saying they were official sponsors of the team. The Spanish Paralympic Committee did not consider them to be sponsors as they were not providing everyone with clothing. They asked Joma to stop what they thought was deceptive advertising. The Spanish Paralympic Committee also considered taking legal action against Joma. The Summer Paralympics became the first Paralympic Games in 20 years where the Spanish Olympic and Paralympic teams did not have the same clothing sponsor. This situation continued with the 2018 Winter Paralympics.\nPara-alpine skiing.\nSkiers.\nJon Santacana competed at the 2002, 2006, 2010 and the 2014 Winter Paralympics with his guide, Miguel Galindo Garces. He won eight medals between 2002 and 2014 at the Paralympics. Three were gold. Three were silver. Two were bronze.\nSchedule and results.\nThe first event on the para-alpine program is the downhill. It starts on 10 March, running from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM. The second event on the program is Super-G. All skiers will race between 9:30 AM and 1:00 PM on 11 March. The super combined takes place on 13 March. The Super-G part of the event is in the morning. The slalom part is in the afternoon. The slalom event gets underway on 14 March and conclude on 15 March. Women and men both race during the same sessions in the morning. The afternoon sessions start with the women doing their second run.

It takes place on 17 - 18 March.\u00a0 Men and women both race at the same time in the morning sessions.\u00a0 Women race first in the afternoon sessions, with the men racing a half hour after they end.\nPara-snowboarding.\nSnowboarders.\nSpain sent two snowboarders to the Paralympic Games in South Korea. They were Astrid Fina Paredes and V\u00edctor Gonz\u00e1lez. They are members of Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Deportes de Personas con Discapacidad F\u00edsica, a sport organization for people with physical disabilities.\nAstrid Fina Paredes.\nAstrid Fina Paredes went to the IPC World Cup 2017 in La Molina, Spain.\u00a0 She won two silver medals.\u00a0 The World Cup was part of her training for the 2018 Winter Paralympics.\u00a0 In February 2017, she went to the IPC Para-Snowboarding World Championships in Big White, Canada. She finished fourth in the snowboard slalom race and fifth in the snowboard cross race. In 2017, she wanted to go to the 2018 Paralympic Games and win a medal. Her fear was she would get hurt. This would make it difficult to race and get a medal. She leaves for South Korea on 2 March 2018, with her first race on 12 March and her second one 15 March.\nAstrid Fina Paredes was at the 2014 Winter Paralympics, with the 2018 Games being her second Games. At Sochi 2014, she finished sixth in snowboard cross. From Barcelona, Fina Paredes has a physical disability because of a traffic accident in 2009. In 2013, her leg was amputated. She started para-snowboarding that year. It was one year from when she start that she went to Sochi. Participating in snowboarding costs a lot of money. To continue to practice and compete in the southern hemisphere during 2016, she needed to rent out her apartment in Spain. Team Spain had no money to help her.\nV\u00edctor Gonz\u00e1lez.\nV\u00edctor Gonz\u00e1lez was a snowboarder. He had an accident. Because of the accident, he got a disability in his legs. After the accident, he switched to para-snowboarding.\nSchedule and results.\nThe snowboard cross event starts on 12 March, running from 10:30 AM to 5:00 PM for all classes for both men and women. The slalom race is scheduled to take place on 16 March, going from 10:30 AM \u2013 4:55 PM for men and women in all classes.\nMedalists.\nThe Government of Spain said there was 135,000 \u20ac total to give to Spanish sportspeople who won medals at the 2018 Games. If a person won a gold medal, they got up to 30,000 \u20ac.\u00a0 If a person won a silver medal, they got up to 15,000 \u20ac.\u00a0 A person with a bronze medal got up to 9,000 \u20ac. These totals have been criticized. At the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the government allocated 1,861,000 \u20ac for Olympic medalists but only 684,000 \u20ac to people who won medals at the Paralympics. The individual totals are still better than the past. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Olympic gold won a person 94,000 \u20ac but a gold medal at the Paralympics only won a person 10,000 \u20ac."}

To do this, they looked around the world for coaches and people who could compete at the Games. They gave citizenship to 19 people for Team South Korea at the Olympics.

The competition was one of seven World Cup races before the season before the Games. He was coached by Roman Podlipnik. He also trained with Slovene deaf skier Anja Drev. His coach was happy in late December. Slivnik was recovering faster than expected from his shoulder injury. At the end of December 2017, he was the only Slovene to have earned the right to compete at the Paralympics. Because his recovery went so fast, he competed at a World Cup in Zagreb, Croatia in early December. This was in addition to the World Cup a week later in Slovenia.

At the World Cup in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, he finished his races. The World Cup was only a few days after the World Cup in Zagreb.

They competed as \"Neutral Paralympic Athletes\" in 5 sports. Only Russian sportspeople that had not participated in doping were allowed to compete. On 26 February 2018, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said which people from Russia could compete as Neutral Paralympic Athletes at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. The list included 30 people. They were going to compete in para-alpine skiing, para-Nordic skiing, para-snowboarding and wheelchair curling.\nEkaterina Rumyantseva won gold and\u00a0 Anna Milenina won silver in the women's 6\u00a0km biathlon standing race.

The list included 30 people. They were going to compete in para-alpine skiing, para-Nordic skiing, para-snowboarding and wheelchair curling. 10 people are competing in para-alpine skiing, 12 in para-Nordic skiing, 3 in para-snowboarding and 5 in wheelchair curling.\u00a0 The team also includes 6 guide skiers.\u00a0 There are also going to be 39 support people and officials. Despite limitations on who can compete because of the doping scandal, Neutral Paralympic Athletes from Russia will be one of the largest delegations at the Games.\nThe table below contains the list of members of people (called \"Team NPA\") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors that could participate at the Games per sport/discipline.\nDoping scandal.\nAfter the 2014 Winter Paralympics, the McLaren report said 35 people from Russia had done doping during the Games in Sochi. A decision had been made by mid-2016 that Russia would not be able to compete under the Russian flag at the 2018 Games. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) set conditions for Russia's membership in November 2016. The McLaren Report, printed in December 2016, said more than 1,000 Olympic and Paralympic people had been involved with Russia's government sponsored doping program.\nIn early January 2017, the Russians asked the ban be removed. They wanted to be able to participate in specific qualifying competitions. In April 2017, a proposal was made to allow Russians to compete using a neutral flag. This was rejected. The IPC explained that people could only use a neutral flag if they were refugees or had no National Paralympic Committee.\nIn May 2017, the IPC said the Russians had until September 2017 to meet all the conditions if they wanted to go to the Winter Paralympics. If they did not meet the conditions, the Russians probably would not be able to go.\n15 National Paralympic Committees and the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation signed a letter expressing support for the National Paralympic Committee of Russia in August 2017.\u00a0 The countries included Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Laos, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Montenegro, and South Korea.\u00a0 They asked the IPC Governing Board to consider letting Russia compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics.\u00a0 The letter was signed weeks before the IPC Governing Board met in Abu Dhabi. In September 2017, this decision was reviewed and upheld. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) still had concerns about doping in Russian sport. All the conditions the IPC required of the Russians were not met.\nIn October 2017, Russians were allowed to compete in qualifying as Neutral Paralympic Athletes. They were allowed to do this in alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing and snowboarding. A decision was not made in October about their participation at the 2018 Games.\nBecause the IPC thought Russia had a doping program run by the government, Russian people were stopped from going to the Games with the Russian flag at the 2018 Games. Some Russian people competed as \"Neutral Paralympic Athletes\" if the IPC thought they were had not done doping. Because of this, Russians were allowed to compete in 5 sports: para-alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, biathlon, snowboarding and wheelchair curling. Russians were allowed to compete because the IPC thought their National Paralympic Committee had met some of the conditions the IPC had demanded of them. More improvements were still needed though before they could compete at the Paralympics as Russia. Russia's Paralympians currently face more difficult conditions than those of Russia's Olympians. The Government of Russia has said the allegations about doping are not true. They blame the United States, saying it is a conspiracy to make sure they cannot compete. Vladmir Putin said the United States was doing this to try to prevent him from winning the election for President of Russia.\nAll eligible people from Russia would need additional testing for use of banned substances. The testing would be more than people from other countries would have to do. As of 29 January 2018, the IPC said 30 to 35 Russian sportspeople might be able to go to the Games the way to decide who was going was still taking place. The last date to win a spot at the 2018 Paralympics was 23 February.\nThe situation mirrors what happened at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, where Russian sportspeople were not allowed to compete using the flag of Russia.\nAlpine skiing.\nQualification.\nOn 28 January 2018, it looked like 14 skiers from Russia could go to South Korea.\nSchedule.\nThe first event on the para-alpine program was the downhill.

They are tired of needing to use unpaid volunteers. They think anti-doping officials need to be paid. Anti-doping Norway chief executive Anders Solheim said, \"If you sell TV rights for this arrangement for billions of dollars, then we think it's wrong that we pay for Norwegian doping controllers to help with the controls. An inspector should receive a reasonable salary and his trip paid for the three weeks he or she will be there. By not paying doping controllers, the organisers are \"de facto\" relying on volunteers. Anti-doping work should not be a voluntary profession for those who want to. It is downplaying the priority of our work, and we are tired of it.\"\nPara-Nordic skiing.\nSkiers.\nBirgit Skarstein competes in two sports: adapted rowing and para-Nordic skiing.\u00a0 She won a gold medal at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in the PR1 W1x.\u00a0 Skarstein also went to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and she finished fourth.\u00a0 Skarstein has also went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics, competing in para-Nordic skiing.\nSchedule and results.\nOn 12 March, the 15\u00a0km race takes place, with standing and vision impaired women starting at 10:00 PM.

While North Korea and South Korea compete as separate countries at the 2018 Winter Games, the two countries will enter the stadium during the Opening Ceremonies under one flag. The two countries are still officially at war as the Korean War never officially ended. They had entered the Olympic Games under one flag before, including at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Winter Games. Reciprocal military threats made in August and September 2017 by the governments of North Korea and the United States made this possibility at the 2018 Games more complicated.\nCompeting together.\nThe International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said North Korea was going to participate in the Winter Games for the first time. The North Koreans will competing under a Korean unification flag like their delegation for the 2018 Winter Olympics did. This is the first time that North Korea went to the Winter Paralympics. The country had gone to the 2012 Summer Paralympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics. On 1 January 2018, Kim Jong-un said he wanted to have North Koreans competing at the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. North Koreans had a meeting with the IPC in Lusanne, Switzerland on 20 January 2018. At the meeting, North Korea and South Korea asked the IPC if they could compete as one team. On 27 February, the two countries met at a small village on the border with South Korea. They discussed how the two countries would compete together at the Winter Games. The Government of South Korea thinks the North going to the Games is important. They think it can reduce the tensions between the two countries.\nHistory.\nNorth Korea remains officially at war with South Korea, with the Korean War ending in 1953 with an armistice and not a peace treaty. The two Koreas each claim the territory of the other, and do not recognize each other as legitimate sovereign states. North Korea had nevertheless asked for the right to co-host the Summer Olympics in 1988, when Seoul made their bid to have the Games. Faced with the refusal expressed by the International Olympic Committee, the North boycotted the Games. The country then orchestrated an attack which destroyed Korean Air flight 858, killing one hundred and fifteen people. Despite these problems, at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Winter Games, the two Koreas marched together under the banner of Korean unification at the opening ceremony as a sign of reconciliation.\nDevelopments.\nThe issue of North Korea's participation in the 2018 Games is complicated by the reciprocal military threats made in August and September 2017 by the governments of North Korea, under the leadership of dictator Kim Jong-un, and the United States, led by President Donald Trump. This included North Korea conducting a nuclear test on September 3 and the firing of North Korean missiles over the territory of Japan. On January 17, following discussions between the two countries in Panmunjeom, it was confirmed that North Korea will participate in the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Pyeongchang."}

It was directed and produced by Gregg Araki. Araki also did the screenplay.\nThe screenplay was based on a 1995 novel.\nThe movie premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in 2004. But it wasn't widely released until 2005.\nPlot.\nDuring summer 1981, Hutchinson, Kansas, two eight-year-old boys, Brian Lackey and Neil McCormick, are teammates in Little League baseball. Both boys have life-changing events.\nNeil is the son of an irresponsible single mother. He is already learning he's homosexual. He is sexually abused by the Little League baseball coach, who leaves town afterward.\nBrian has a neglectful father and working mother. He remembers it starting to rain during a game. The next thing he remembers is being inside a crawl space with a bloody nose. He doesn't have any memory of the intervening five hours.\nNeil views his sexual abuse as love; he becomes mainly attracted to middle-aged men. He begins prostituting himself at age 15. Three years later, he moves to New York City. His best friend, Wendy Peterson, lives there.\nFor years after coming to in the crawl space, Brian has heavy nosebleeds, blackouts and wets the bed. When he's 18, Brian meets a woman, Avalyn Friesen, who believes aliens kidnapped her. They form a relationship. But when she comes on to him, he panics and refuses to speak to her again.\nWhile trying to untangle his confused memories, Brian sees a photo of his Little League teammate Neil; he recognizes Neil as the boy from his dreams.\nBrian wants to meet his former teammate Neil. But instead, he meets Neil's mother and his friend Eric Pressly; through Eric, Brian learns more on Neil.\nAfter being beaten and raped, Neil returns to Hutchinson to celebrate Christmas with his mother.\nBrian and Neil meet for the first time in over a decade. They break into a house that had been rented by the baseball coach. Neil begins telling Brian of that night.\nWhen the baseball game was rained out, and Brian didn't have a ride home, the coach offered to drive Brian home with Neil. But instead, they went to the coach's house, where the coach had sex with the boys, and made the boys have sex with each other.\nAfter the coach and Neil put Brian's clothes back on, Brian fell down face first on the floor, causing his bloody nose.\nLearning the truth at last, Brian breaks down crying; Neil comforts him as Christmas carolers sing \"Silent Night\".\nReception.\n\"Mysterious Skin\" got positive reviews.

The movie was then released unrated in the United States.\nThe movie was controversial in Australia, where Australian Family Association asked for a review of the movie's rating. They wanted to have \"Mysterious Skin\" banned due to its depiction of pedophilia. But the Classification Review Board voted four to two in favor of an R18 rating.\nThe movie got a Jury Award from Bergen International Film Festival in 2004. It also won the Polished Apple Awards in 2006."}

Ernest was created by the Nashville advertising agency Carden &amp; Cherry and was used in various local television ad campaigns.\nErnest, almost always dressed in a denim vest and baseball cap, appeared at the door of an unseen and unheard, but seemingly unwilling, next door neighbor named Vern. The spots were structured in a way to allow the viewer to be \"Vern\" as Varney looked directly at the camera whenever Vern was addressed. Ernest's seemingly pointless conversations with Vern \u2013 which were actually a monologue due to Vern never responding \u2013 inevitably rambled around to a favorable description of the sponsor's product, followed by his signature close, \"KnowhutImean?\" While Vern is never shown to ever say anything, it is implied that he finds Ernest to be an unwelcome pest due to him trying to slam his door in Ernest's face on a few occasions. Vern also shakes his head no whenever Ernest invites him to do something. Despite having good intentions, Ernest is utterly oblivious to Vern's apparent distress regarding him and always regards Vern as his closest friend and confidant.\nParodies.\nErnest has been parodied in numerous television series, including \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"Family Guy\", and \"The Simpsons\".\nSome of the \"fake\" Ernest movies from \"The Simpsons\" include \"Ernest Needs a Kidney\", \"Ernest vs. the Pope\", \"Ernest Goes to Broadway\", \"Ernest Goes Straight to Video,\" and \"Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap\".\nIn the \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" episode \"At the Movies,\" the boys are watching Ernest at the drive-in. Ernest is inside the Statue of Liberty and comes across a door with a sign that reads \"DO NOT ENTER.\" However, Ernest misreads it as \"donut entry\" and opens the door, falling through the statue's nose.\nOthers that have referenced the Ernest movies include \"ALF\", \"Saved by the Bell\", \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", \"Kenan &amp; Kel\", \"The Nanny\", \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"Teen Titans Go\", and many more.\nCommercials on home video.\nMost of Ernest's commercials were released on VHS tapes from Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures Home Video. Many are also available on DVD from Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment.\nMerchandise.\nIn 1986, a paperback book \"The Ernest P. Worrell Book of Knawledge\" (sic) was published by Camden and Cherry. In 1989, a 16\" Ernest talking doll was produced by Kenner.\nReboot.\nIn October 2012, a movie reboot tentatively titled \"Son of Ernest\" was announced.

It had been captured by the Germans in December 1914, giving them a strategic advantage due to its height.\nNaturally the British wanted to take it back and so in April 1915 they began tunnelling. This use of offensive mining involved digging tunnels into and under the hill in order to place 5 mines beneath the hill. When they were detonated they literally blew the top off Hill 60 allowing the British to retake the crucial position.\nAll the men who joined the Tunnelling Companies were experienced miners; they came from the coal mines in Northumberland, from the sewers in Manchester and the tubes in London. Most of them had been digging since they were 10 years old, with generations of mining history and were often shorter than regular soldiers.\nIn the barbaric, secret wars below ground; it was these men who experienced one of the highest death rates.\nUnfortunately almost as soon as the battle for Hill 60 was finished, the Second Battle of Ypres began. In these significant battles, the Germans used chlorine gas for the first time. And by the end of the battle, the Germans had moved two miles closer to Ypres, on the eastern side of the salient."}

It includes two sports. They are cross country skiing and biathlon. Both sports are for blind people and people with physical disabilities.\nBiathlon.\nBiathlon uses the same rules created by the International Biathlon Association (IBU). Some changes have been made to the rules by the International Paralympic Nordic Skiing Committee (IPNNC).\nBiathlon is two sports combined. These sports are shooting and cross country skiing. Biathlon has several types of races. They are 7.5 km, 12.5 km, and pursuit. During the race, people shoot their guns two to four times. Each time they shoot, they take five shots. Depending on the competition, there are two different consequences for missing. They may get a points penalty. They may have to ski a penalty distance.\nBlind people and people with physical disabilities compete in the biathlon. People with physical disabilities are separated into two groups. These are standing skiers and sitting skiers.\nBlind people use a special electro-acoustic firing system. Their helmets have a wireless connection with their weapons. Using their headphones, they can locate the target. The closer their weapon is aimed at the target, the louder the sound.\nCross country skiing.\nThe rules for cross country skiing are similar to the ones created by International Ski Federation (FIS). They have been modified by the International Para Nordic Skiing Committee (IPNNC). Blind people and people with physical disabilities compete in cross country skiing. People with physical disabilities are separated into two groups. These are standing skiers and sitting skiers. People with physical disabilities who ski while standing are classified from LW2 to LW9. People with physical disabilities who use a sit ski are classified from LW10 to LW12. People who are blind are classified from B1 to B3. People who are blind use a guide skier. Guide skiers tell a blind skier which direction to ski.\nBecause people with different types of disabilities ski against each other, a system has been created to make the results more fair. The person with the best time does not always win. Instead, the finishing time is multiplied against a percentage. The percentage is based on how difficult a person's disability makes it to ski. The time multiplied by the percentages gives a new time result. This new time is used to determine who wins a race."}

One person on the team throws a 19.96 kilogram granite stone across an ice track. The track is 45 meter long. At the end of the track is a big circle. It has 4 rings. The diameter is 183 centimeters. There is a dot in the center. A team tries to get their stones the closest to the center. After each team throws ten stones, the team with the most stones closest to the center wins.\nThe person who throws the stone sits in their chair on a rubber mat. They use a special stick to assist in throwing the stone.\nEligibility.\nPeople who can play wheelchair curling have to have a disability. There are several eligible types of disabilities. They include paraplegics, people with cerebral palsy, people with amputations of the lower limbs, and people with multiple sclerosis."}

The beetle feeds on the inner bark of pine trees like the lodgepole pine, forming tunnels under the bark to lay their eggs. Normally, the mountain pine beetle prefers to attack sick or old trees because they can't defend themselves easily. However, sometimes the beetles become so numerous that they will group up and start attacking healthy trees in massive outbreaks. This makes the control and monitoring of mountain pine beetle very important for the forest industry in Canada and the U.S., because massive outbreaks of mountain pine beetle can kill entire forests.\nRecently, a large outbreak of the beetle in British Columbia became a major problem, killing millions of trees across the province. Due to global warming making it easier for the beetle to survive high in the Canadian Rockies, the beetle was able to spread into Alberta, Canada, where the beetle has never been seen before. Scientists are worried that there is nothing stopping the mountain pine beetle from spreading across the entire continent now. "}

The guyot was named after him.\nEarly life.\nGuyot was born on September 28, 1807 at Boudevilliers, near Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. He schooled at the college of Neuch\u00e2tel, Chaux-de-Fonds. In 1825, he traveled to Germany and lived in Karlsruhe where he met Louis Agassiz. From Karlsruhe he moved to Stuttgart, where he studied at the gymnasium. He returned to Neuch\u00e2tel in 1827. He determined to enter the ministry and started at the University of Berlin to attend lectures. While in college, he also attended lectures on philosophy and natural science. His leisure time was spent in collecting shells and plants, and he received an entr\u00e9e to the Berlin Botanical Garden from Humboldt. In 1835, he received the degree of PhD from Berlin.\nWorks.\nIn 1838, his friend, Agassiz, suggested that he visited the Swiss glaciers. He visited the Swiss glaciers and communicated the results of his six-week investigation to the Geological Society of France. He was the first to point out certain important observations relating to glacial motion and structure. He also noted the more rapid flow of the center than of the sides, and the more rapid flow of the top than of the bottom of glaciers; described the laminated or ribboned structure of the glacial ice; and ascribed the movement of glaciers to a gradual molecular displacement rather than to a sliding of the ice mass as held by de Saussure. He also went on to collect important data concerning erratic boulders.\nIn 1839, he became the colleague of Agassiz as professor of history and physical geography at the College of Neuch\u00e2tel (a.k.a. Neuch\u00e2tel Academy). When the institution got suspended in 1848, Guyot travelled to the United States, where he settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He delivered lectures for a course at the Lowell Institute which were later published as \"Earth and Man\" (Boston 1849). For several years the Massachusetts Board of Education employed him as a lecturer on geography and methods of instruction to the normal schools and teachers' institutes.\nHe was occupied with this work until in 1854, when he was appointed professor of physical geography and geology at Princeton University. This was his office until his death. He was also for several years lecturer on physical geography in the State Normal School in Trenton, New Jersey, and from 1861 to 1866 lecturer in the Princeton Theological Seminary. He also gave courses in the Union Theological Seminary, New York, and at Columbia College. He founded the museum at Princeton, many of the specimens of which are from his own collections.\nHis scientific work in the United States included the perfection of plans for a national system of meteorological observations. Most of these were conducted under the Smithsonian Institution. His extensive meteorological observations led to the establishment of the United States Weather Bureau, and his \"Meteorological and Physical Tables\" (1852, revised ed. 1884) were long standard.\nA guyot, also known as a tablemount, is an isolated underwater volcanic mountain (seamount), with a flat top over 200 metres (660\u00a0feet) below the surface of the sea. The diameters of these flat summits can be more than . The term \"guyot\" was coined by Harry Hammond Hess and named after Arnold Guyot.\nGuyot rejected Darwin's theory of human evolution and, at the same time, he accepted Hugh Miller's views on the book of Genesis, thinking that the days described there might have taken a longer period of time. Scientist James Dwight Dana described Guyot as \"a fervently religious man, living as if ever in communion with his Heavenly Parent; a Christian, following closely in the footsteps of his Master.\""}

{"id": "622799", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=622799", "title": "Anchiceratops", "text": "Anchiceratops was a kind of plant-eating dinosaur. It had a long frill on the back of its head and three horns on its face. There were two long ones above its eyes and one shorter one on its nose. It was similar to \"Triceratops\", which also had these features. \"Anchiceratops\" was found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which is a fossil site in Alberta. There is just one species of \"Anchiceratops\", \"A. ornatus\".\nHistory of Finds.\nBarnum Brown found the first \"Anchiceratops\" skulls in 1912. He gave them their name, \"Anchiceratops ornatus\", in 1914, two years later. \"Anchiceratops\" means \"almost \"Ceratops\"\" and \"ornatus\" means \"ornate\". In 1924, C. M. Sternberg discovered another skull. It was smaller and had a long beak. In 1929, he named this species \"A. longirostris\", meaning \"long snout.\" However, in 1990, Leham decided that \"A. longirostris\" was only the female of \"A. ornatus\". Another study done by Dodson and Currie in the same year agreed with this idea. In 1925, Sternberg found a headless skeleton that he thought belonged to \"Anchiceratops\". However, it could belong to \"Arrhinoceratops\" or a new genus. Other skulls have been found but they have never been described.\nDescription.\n\"Anchiceratops\" could be 4.5 meters (15 feet) long and 1.5 tonnes (1.65 tons) in weight. If the unnamed skeleton belonged to \"Anchiceratops\", then it would only be 4.3 meters (14 feet) and weigh just 1.2 tonnes (1.32 tons).\n\"Anchiceratops\" had a short nose horn that went forwards. The horns above its eyes (brow horns) were long and went a bit to the side. They were slightly curved. The frill was narrow and had many small hornlets on its outside edge. It did not angle upwards very far. The snout on some specimens is very long.\nThe skeleton that may belong to this dinosaur was strange. It was smaller than in most other ceratopsids. It had a long neck and strong arms, but it had a short tail with only 38 vertebrae instead of 45. The length of its thighbone was 74 centimeters and its shin was 51.5 centimeters long.\nClassification.\n\"Anchiceratops\" was classified like this by Scott Sampson in 2010. This family tree shows many related ceratopsids.\nPaleoecology.\n\"Anchiceratops\" lived in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. \"Arrhinoceratops\" and one other ceratopsid may also have lived there. When \"Anchiceratops\" was alive the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was a floodplain with forests. \"Anchiceratops\" seems to have liked marshy places, unlike other ceratopsids that liked drier locations."}

In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew hexadecagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a octagonal antiprism with the same D8d, [2+,16] symmetry, order 32. The octagrammic antiprism, s{2,16/3} and octagrammic crossed-antiprism, s{2,16/5} also have regular skew octagons.\nIn art.\nIn the early 16th century, Raphael was the first to construct a perspective image of a regular hexadecagon: the tower in his painting \"The Marriage of the Virgin\" has 16 sides, elaborating on an eight-sided tower in a previous painting by Pietro Perugino.\nHexadecagrams (16-sided star polygons) are included in the Girih patterns in the Alhambra.\nIrregular hexadecagons.\nAn octagonal star can be seen as a concave hexadecagon:"}
{"id": "622929", "revid": "5295", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=622929", "title": "Parallelepiped", "text": "In geometry, a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms (the term rhomboid is also sometimes used with this meaning). By analogy, it relates to a parallelogram just as a cube relates to a square or as a cuboid to a rectangle. In Euclidean geometry, its definition encompasses all four concepts (i.e., \"parallelepiped\", \"parallelogram\", \"cube\", and \"square\"). In this context of affine geometry, in which angles are not differentiated, its definition admits only \"parallelograms\" and \"parallelepipeds\". Three equivalent definitions of \"parallelepiped\" are\nThe rectangular cuboid (six rectangular faces), cube (six square faces), and the rhombohedron (six rhombus faces) are all specific cases of parallelepiped.\nProperties.\nAny of the three pairs of parallel faces can be viewed as the base planes of the prism. A parallelepiped has three sets of four parallel edges; the edges within each set are of equal length.\nParallelepipeds result from linear transformations of a cube (for the non-degenerate cases: the bijective linear transformations).\nSince each face has point symmetry, a parallelepiped is a zonohedron. Also the whole parallelepiped has point symmetry \"Ci\" (see also triclinic). Each face is, seen from the outside, the mirror image of the opposite face. The faces are in general chiral, but the parallelepiped is not.\nA space-filling tessellation is possible with congruent copies of any parallelepiped.\nVolume.\nThe volume of a parallelepiped is the product of the area of its base \"A\" and its height \"h\". The base is any of the six faces of the parallelepiped. The height is the perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite face.\nAn alternative method defines the vectors a = (\"a\"1, \"a\"2, \"a\"3), b = (\"b\"1, \"b\"2, \"b\"3) and c = (\"c\"1, \"c\"2, \"c\"3) to represent three edges that meet at one vertex. The volume of the parallelepiped then equals the absolute value of the scalar triple product a\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(b\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0c):\nThis is true because, if we choose b and c to represent the edges of the base, the area of the base is, by definition of the cross product (see geometric meaning of cross product),\nwhere \"\u03b8\" is the angle between b and c, and the height is \nwhere \"\u03b1\" is the internal angle between a and \"h\".\nFrom the figure, we can deduce that the magnitude of \u03b1 is limited to 0\u00b0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\"\u03b1\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a090\u00b0. On the contrary, the vector b\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0c may form with a an internal angle \"\u03b2\" larger than 90\u00b0 (0\u00b0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\"\u03b2\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a0180\u00b0). Namely, since b\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0c is parallel to \"h\", the value of \"\u03b2\" is either \"\u03b2\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"\u03b1\" or \"\u03b2\"\u00a0= 180\u00b0\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"\u03b1\". So \nand \nWe conclude that \nwhich is, by definition of the scalar (or dot) product, equivalent to the absolute value of a \u00b7 (b\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0c), Q.E.D.\nThe latter expression is also equivalent to the absolute value of the determinant of a three dimensional matrix built using a, b and c as rows (or columns):\nThis is found using Cramer's Rule on three reduced two dimensional matrices found from the original.\nIf \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are the parallelepiped edge lengths, and \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are the internal angles between the edges, the volume is\nCorresponding tetrahedron.\nThe volume of any tetrahedron that shares three converging edges of a parallelepiped has a volume equal to one sixth of the volume of that parallelepiped (see proof).\nSpecial cases.\nFor parallelepipeds with a symmetry plane there are two cases:\nSee also monoclinic.\nA rectangular cuboid, also called a \"rectangular parallelepiped\" or sometimes simply a \"cuboid\", is a parallelepiped of which all faces are rectangular; a cube is a cuboid with square faces.\nA rhombohedron is a parallelepiped with all rhombic faces; a trigonal trapezohedron is a rhombohedron with congruent rhombic faces.\nPerfect parallelepiped.\nA \"perfect parallelepiped\" is a parallelepiped with integer-length edges, face diagonals, and space diagonals. In 2009, dozens of perfect parallelepipeds were shown to exist, answering an open question of Richard Guy. One example has edges 271, 106, and 103, minor face diagonals 101, 266, and 255, major face diagonals 183, 312, and 323, and space diagonals 374, 300, 278, and 272. \nSome perfect parallelopipeds having two rectangular faces are known. But it is not known whether there exist any with all faces rectangular; such a case would be called a perfect cuboid.\nParallelotope.\nCoxeter called the generalization of a parallelepiped in higher dimensions a parallelotope.\nSpecifically in \"n\"-dimensional space it is called \"n\"-dimensional parallelotope, or simply \"n\"-parallelotope. Thus a parallelogram is a 2-parallelotope and a parallelepiped is a 3-parallelotope.\nMore generally a parallelotope, or \"voronoi parallelotope\", has parallel and congruent opposite facets. So a 2-parallelotope is a parallelogon which can also include certain hexagons, and a 3-parallelotope is a parallelohedron, including 5 types of polyhedra.\nThe diagonals of an \"n\"-parallelotope intersect at one point and are bisected by this point. Inversion in this point leaves the \"n\"-parallelotope unchanged. See also fixed points of isometry groups in Euclidean space.\nThe edges radiating from one vertex of a \"k\"-parallelotope form a \"k\"-frame formula_9 of the vector space, and the parallelotope can be recovered from these vectors, by taking linear combinations of the vectors, with weights between 0 and 1.\nThe \"n\"-volume of an \"n\"-parallelotope embedded in formula_10 where formula_11 can be computed by means of the Gram determinant. Alternatively, the volume is the norm of the exterior product of the vectors:\nIf \"m\" = \"n\", this amounts to the absolute value of the determinant of the \"n\" vectors.\nAnother formula to compute the volume of an \"n\"-parallelotope \"P\" in formula_13, whose vertices are formula_14, is \nwhere formula_16 is the row vector formed by the concatenation of formula_17 and 1. Indeed, the determinant is unchanged if formula_18 is subtracted from formula_16 (), and placing formula_18 in the last position only changes its sign. \nSimilarly, the volume of any \"n\"-simplex that shares \"n\" converging edges of a parallelotope has a volume equal to one 1/\"n\"! of the volume of that parallelotope.\nLexicography.\nThe word appears as \"parallelipipedon\" in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid's Elements, dated 1570. In the 1644 edition of his \"Cursus mathematicus\", Pierre H\u00e9rigone used the spelling \"parallelepipedum\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites the present-day \"parallelepiped\" as first appearing in Walter Charleton's \"Chorea gigantum\" (1663).\nCharles Hutton's Dictionary (1795) shows \"parallelopiped\" and \"parallelopipedon\", showing the influence of the combining form \"parallelo-\", as if the second element were \"pipedon\" rather than \"epipedon\". Noah Webster (1806) includes the spelling \"parallelopiped\". The 1989 edition of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" describes \"parallelopiped\" (and \"parallelipiped\") explicitly as incorrect forms, but these are listed without comment in the 2004 edition, and only pronunciations with the emphasis on the fifth syllable \"pi\" () are given.\nA change away from the traditional pronunciation has hidden the different partition suggested by the Greek roots, with \"epi-\" (\"on\") and \"pedon\" (\"ground\") combining to give \"epiped\", a flat \"plane\". Thus the faces of a parallelepiped are planar, with opposite faces being parallel."}

Sometimes it is specified as having two \"and only two\" sides of equal length, and sometimes as having \"at least\" two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.\nExamples of isosceles triangles include the isosceles right triangle, the golden triangle, and the faces of bipyramids and certain Catalan solids.\nThe mathematical study of isosceles triangles dates back to ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Isosceles triangles have been used as decoration from even earlier times, and appear frequently in architecture and design, for instance in the pediments and gables of buildings.\nThe two equal sides are called the legs and the third side is called the base of the triangle. The other dimensions of the triangle, such as its height, area, and perimeter, can be calculated by simple formulas from the lengths of the legs and base.\nEvery isosceles triangle has an axis of symmetry along the perpendicular bisector of its base. The two angles opposite the legs are equal and are always acute, so the classification of the triangle as acute, right, or obtuse depends only on the angle between its two legs."}

Duffy was born on October 20, 1894, in Charleroi, Pennsylvania, the eldest of three children, with two younger brothers. Olive or Ollie, as she was known to family and friends, did not have much of a childhood. Life in industrial Pittsburgh was depressing and grim with its smoky factories and hard living. Olive accidentally ingested bi-chloride of mercury from a French-labeled bottle in a darkened bathroom, believing it to be another medication. Found unconscious, she died five days later. The death made worldwide headlines. Olive was only 25 when she died. She was immediately rushed to a hospital. Blinded and unable to talk due to burned vocal chords, it was hard for her to communicate with the French police, who were investigating the incident. In any case, the police left satisfied the event was an accident. Thomas passed away a day later, with her husband and brother-in-law Owen Moore at her side. She was 25 years old. Olive's final film, Everybody's Sweetheart (1920), was released after her death. Her name lives on, steeped in her scandal, enhanced by fabrications in Hollywood Babylon. Many of her films still reportedly exist (about 12 complete and some in fragments), though they have not as of yet been released on DVD or home video. On September 10, 1920, Thomas died of acute nephritis in Paris five days after consuming mercury bichloride. Although her death was ruled accidental.

They have been invented or taken by a person or family. They are not recognised by the present or past government of the country. \nThere are a number of schemes that pretend to confer or sell such titles. They have flourished by use of the internet. \nSelf-styled titles.\nIn monarchies, genuine titles do exist. But they may no longer be recognised by a successor state (such as a republic). Such is the case with French titles, for example. Formerly noble families often still use their old titles, and this is generally acceptable in that society. The title is borne or claimed by a hereditary heir. That is different from an invented or falsely-attributed noble title which is claimed without any historic basis.\nSelf-assumption of a title is not necessarily illegal. It depends on the law in the particular country. The bearers of some self-assumed titles do not claim that the titles have been recognized by any nation at any time. \nSome individuals, associations or companies pretend to give a legal or official right to a title, to an individual or family. Naturally, this requires a remittance or donation, and hence the transaction may be illegal. Also, pretending to be a titled person with intent to deceive also may be an offence."}

The codename 'Ultra', however, was only given to the work in 1941.\nWork on understanding the Enigma, and on breaking German military signals, was of vital importance in the Battle of the Atlantic, the greatest threat to Britain during the war. The key event occurred in 1941, when not just a machine, but also a codebook, was got from a German submarine.\nWartime signals intelligence (SIGINT) were got as follows. First of all, encrypted German radio messages in Morse code were recorded in Britain. Their place of origin was got by recording the messages at two different receiving places. The attack on the codes was done at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park.\nUltra became the standard term among the western Allies for all such intelligence. The name arose because the intelligence got was thought more important than the highest British security classification (\"Most Secret\")."}

The results of this would become Volume 3 of the Expedition, Botany and plant ecology (1958), co-edited with Charles P. Mountford. He also edited Volume 4 entitled Zoology (1964).\nSpecht worked as a senior research fellow at the University of Adelaide from 1950 while he worked on his MSc. He was appointed a lecturer in botany in 1951, and worked on his PhD for the next two years, on mineral nutrition and biomass relationships of the heath vegetation at Dark Island, South Australia. He rose to Senior Lecturer in 1955. In 1956, Specht earnt Fulbright, Smith Mundt and Carnegie grants to study in the U.S.\nSpecht took up a position as Reader in plant ecology at the University of Melbourne in 1961, and became Acting Head of the Department of Botany in 1964. He moved to the University of Queensland in 1966 as Professor and Head of the Department of Botany and remained there until 1989. He was Visiting Professor in the Department of Forestry at the University of Oxford in 1970. He was Visiting Professor in the Department of Botany at the University of Leeds in 1975.\nPersonal life.\nRay Specht married Marion Gilies in 1952. They met on a University of Queensland Science Student Expedition to Fraser Island in 1949. They had one daughter, Alison.\nSpecht died on February 13, 2021 in Brisbane, Queensland at the age of 96."}

Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. was the son of John Fillmore Jr. (1702\u20131777), a ship's captain. John Fillmore Jr. was the son of John Fillmore Sr. (1676\u20131712), a native and mariner.\nCareer.\nAfter his marriage, Fillmore began farming in Vermont. Shortly thereafter, Nathaniel and his brother Calvin Fillmore were approached by land agents offering tracts in New York state. Unhappy with trying to make the stony ground of their Vermont land productive, they quickly grabbed the opportunity and moved to western New York, sight unseen.\nAccording to biographers of Millard Fillmore, \"The Fillmore brothers moved their two families to their new homeland nestled deep within a timber-laden forest. Location was not their greatest problem. Nor was the dense clay they unearthed once the land was cleared. Their greatest setback came with the realization that faulty surveying coupled with corrupt local government officials had left them with virtually nothing. Duped, tired, and poor, Nathaniel eventually became a tenant farmer while occasionally teaching school, working the soil for landlords and taking their charity when necessary to survive.\nOver time, Nathaniel Fillmore's fortunes changed; he became prominent enough while living in Niles, New York that he served as a justice of the peace for eleven years. He eventually purchased a farm in East Aurora, New York which he developed into a productive enterprise. He died in East Aurora, New York in 1863, and was buried at East Aurora Cemetery.\nHistorians have credited his wife, Phoebe, for convincing her husband to secure a clerk\u2019s position for Millard in the office of their landlord, Judge Walter Wood. Though Fillmore did not complete the clerkship, it did set him on the eventual path to a successful legal and political career that carried him to the presidency.\nAfter Millard assumed the presidency in 1850, Nathaniel visited him the following year, Robert J. Scarry writing that the visit was the one most anticipated by President Fillmore.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1796, the 25 year-old Fillmore married sixteen year-old Phoebe Millard, daughter of a prominent physician, in Bennington. Together, they had nine children:\nAfter Phoebe died in 1831, he remarried to Eunice Love in 1834.\nDistinction.\nHe was the first of only four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., and George H. W. Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son."}

Cary married three times and had seven children, three with his first wife Sarah Sclater and four with his second wife, Ann Edwards.\nConstruction.\nCary became visibly active in construction after his father's retirement in 1710 and in December 1720 he was authorized to work on the Governor's Palace, in Williamsburg, Virginia, a project that his father had begun but was unable to complete. This was one of several jobs that Cary performed at Williamsburg and in 1726 he was hired to construct new gates for the Capitol.\nHe went on to oversee the construction of several buildings at the College of William &amp; Mary (also in Williamsburg): a chapel wing (1729) and the President's House (1732), and Cary was also likely in charge of constructing the Brafferton building (1723).\nAround 1733, Cary moved to the bank of the James River, where he built Ampthill, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, which served as the Cary family home for many generations."}

She said that the use of torture had not made the world a safer place, adding that the use of water-boarding by the United States was a \"profound mistake\" and as a result America lost its \"moral authority\".\nIn her third and final lecture, titled \"Freedom\", recorded at the British Library in London, she discussed foreign policy priorities since the September 11 attacks. She stated that it was \"necessary\" to talk to dictators and terrorists, to protect security and said that the British government's decision to engage with Colonel Gaddafi in 2003 was \"the right decision\". She went on to say that protecting British citizens would be impossible if the security services were restricted to talking only to those with shared values and cited examples where people once deemed terrorists were now part of the political establishment: \"Look at Northern Ireland, where former terrorists are in government... look at Mandela and the ANC which used terror tactics when it was in exile.\""}

It is the server version of Windows 8 and succeeds Windows Server 2008 R2. Two pre-release versions, a developer preview and a beta version, were released during development. The software was generally available to customers starting on September 4, 2012.\nUnlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2012 has no support for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various features were added or improved over Windows Server 2008 R2 (with many placing an emphasis on cloud computing), such as an updated version of Hyper-V, an IP address management role, a new version of Windows Task Manager, and ReFS, a new file system. Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8.\nThe successor to Windows Server 2012, called Windows Server 2012 R2, was released along with Windows 8.1 in October 2013. A service pack, formally designated Windows Server 2012 R2 Update, was released in April 2014.\nHistory.\nWindows Server 2012, codenamed \"Windows Server 8\", is the sixth release of Windows Server family of operating systems developed concurrently with Windows 8. It was not until April 17, 2012 that the company announced that the final product name would be \"Windows Server 2012\".\nMicrosoft introduced Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 conference on September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only made available to MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.\nBefore Windows Server 2012 was finalized, two test builds were made public. A public beta version of Windows Server 2012 was released along with the Windows 8 Consumer Preview on February 29, 2012. The release candidate of Windows Server 2012 was released on May 31, 2012, along with the Windows 8 Release Preview.\nThe product was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012 and became generally available on September 4, 2012.

Windows Server 2016 was released on September 26, 2016 at Microsoft's Ignite conference and became generally available on October 12, 2016. It has two successors: Windows Server 2019, and the Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel, which excludes the graphical user interface and many older components.\nDevelopment.\nMicrosoft has been reorganized by Satya Nadella, putting the Server and System Center teams together. Previously, the Server team was more closely aligned with the Windows client team. The Azure team is also working closely with the Server team.\nIn March 2017, Microsoft demonstrated an internal version of Server 2016 running on the ARMv8-A architecture. It was reported that Microsoft was working with Qualcomm Centriq and Cavium ThunderX2 chips. According to James Vincent of \"The Verge\", this decision endangers Intel's dominance of the server CPU market.

The new licensing structure that has been adopted by Windows Server 2016 has also moved away from the Windows Server 2012/2012R2 CPU socket licensing model in that now the amount of cores covered under one license is limited. Windows Server 2016 Standard and Datacenter core licensing now covers a minimum of 8 core licenses for each physical processor and a minimum of 16 core licenses for each server. Core licenses are sold in packs of two with Standard Edition providing the familiar rights to run 2 virtualized OS environments. If the server goes over 16 core licenses for a 2 processor server additional licenses will now be required with Windows Server 2016.\nVersion 1709.\nWindows Server, version 1709 was released on October 17, 2017. The release has dropped the Windows Server 2016 name and is just called Windows Server by Microsoft. It is offered to the Microsoft Software Assurance customers who have an active Windows Server 2016 license and has the same system requirements. This is the first Windows Server product to fall under the \"Semi-Annual Channel\" (SAC) release cadence. This product only features the Server Core and the Nano Server modes.

The protest against it changed the game forever and made players have to adapt to new rules. Many wanted to stop D&amp;D completely, but in the end\u00a0 compromises were made and the game is enjoyed by millions today.\nOccult in the 1980s.\nIn the 1980s, fear of the occult was a big problem. It all began when a mother believed her daughter's daycare center was teaching her to support and worship Satan. Daycare centers were very new back then and parents were afraid of the safety of their children. This one mother's accusation led an investigation as other parents started making false claims. \nThe interrogated children never said anything bad happened. Parents got so mad at this that many police scared the kids into saying what they wanted to hear. Accusations like this spread across the country, from rock music to card games. D&amp;D was a big part of those accusations.\nD&amp;D was arguably the first true role-playing game. Many people feared the occult and because of all these reports with D&amp;D, suicides and murders, people also started fearing D&amp;D. Time magazine published an article about D&amp;D being satanic. \nThough it was satire, it still caught on to people's fear of the occult. This fear led to problems with the criminal justice system. For example the West Memphis 3, 3 teens accused of murder, were prosecuted just because of people being scared of the occult. Even a policeman changed a story about the Irving Pulling case (Suicides &amp; Harm) because he was scared of TSR suing him.\nSuicides and harm.\nJames Dallas Egbert III disappeared in 1979 from his dorm in Michigan State University. He was found alive in the utility tunnels of the school two days later by a private investigator after James attempted suicide. His mother had found his suicide note the day before. The note referenced Egbert\u2019s character in D&amp;D needing to die because a demon told him to kill himself. \nHis mother completely blamed the game. Egbert suffered from many mental illnesses that were not researched enough, including depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety. William Dear, the private investigator, suspected that the game had caused James' actions. \nThe media took this as a fact and started an outrage against D&amp;D. Dear thought Egbert went into the tunnels to play a live action version of the game. A year later, Egbert died from a gunshot suicide This story was the basis of the book (and later movie) Mazes &amp; Monsters.\nIn 1983 the suicide of Irving Lee Pulling II was also associated with D&amp;D. Patricia Pulling, Irving\u2019s mom, founded Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons as a result. Ms.Pulling found other D&amp;D players who did harmful actions such as James Curbing, a rabid player, who killed his school principal, wounded three classmates, then shot himself. There was a view that teenagers could not see the difference between fantasy and reality, and that all these murders and suicides were building on that, especially after many suicide notes mentioned the game.\nPatricia Pulling and BADD.\nAugust, 1983. Investigators found Irving Lee Pulling and his brother dead from gunshot wounds beneath a railroad trestle. Irving had a gun in hand. Police thought it was a murder suicide. Pulling saw the incident as more than a murder suicide. She blamed Irving\u2019s favorite game, Dungeons and Dragons, for his death. \nClassmates say the trestle they were found under was a frequent place the boys would venture to play D&amp;D. Investigators found that earlier that day Irving\u2019s character had a curse cast upon him. The curse was supposed to cause his character \u201cemotional pain and damage.\u201d Pulling the curse was real, and was the cause of his suicide.\nPatricia Pulling said her claims about D&amp;D supporting Satan had to be true because no one would be able to write with so much detail (in the manuals) without vast knowledge of the occult. Some monsters from the original Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons were demons, with varying degrees of power over the characters. Patricia sued Irving\u2019s school for allowing the kids to play there. The principal argued that the game was not part of the curriculum of the school, and the charges were dropped. \nThe CDC found no link between the game and violence. Yet, Patricia continued her fight by creating the group BADD. BADD\u2019s messages and PSA\u2019s spread across the world. Patricia released a book titled The Devil\u2019s Web- Who is Stalking Your Child for Satan? \u00a0In it she said players will become a \u201chomosexual satanists who will sacrifice their parents, their sister, and the family cat, then commit suicide in a satanic ritual\". (From Patricia's Book)\nSome people still thought D&amp;D was good. Michael Stackpole published articles like The Pulling Report and The Truth About Role-Playing Games to discredit Pulling's claims about D&amp;D. Stackpole found that the suicide rate for people who DID play rpgs was actually lower than the suicide rate for the general population.\nEventually, due to the negativity, TSR made changes to the game. James Ward, an executive at TSR had demons and devils removed from the Monster Manual and Assassins and some spells removed from the Player's Handbook. Ward explained his actions in an article in Dragon, a magazine about fantasy role-playing games, saying that \"Avoiding the Angry Mother Syndrome has become a good, basic guideline, for all of the designers and editors at TSR, Inc.\". In later editions TSR re-added some of the removed features in a separate manual intended for mature readers. (From 5e monster manual)\nToday, the game is played around the world, and parents can be rest assured knowing that their children are not becoming Satanists."}

Sidney, Jerry, Douglas, Kyle and Jill rush in to save Olivia, but the killer injures them and gets away; Sidney, Jerry, Douglas, Kyle and Jill are taken to the hospital. In the hospital's parking garage, Ghostface murders Rebecca. Gale, trying to solve the murders, enlists the help of two high school movie fanatics, Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin) and Robbie Mercer (Erik Knudsen), who explain that the killer is using the rules of movie remakes. Charlie concludes that the killer will likely strike at a party being held that night.\nGale goes to the party to investigate. Ghostface injures her but flees when Dewey arrives. Dewey takes her to the hospital. At Jill's house, Sidney, Jerry, Douglas and Kyle discover that the policemen assigned to guard the house are dead.

Sidney, Jerry, Douglas and Kyle go upstairs to find Jill, promising to return to Kirby. After Kirby answers Ghostface's questions, she goes outside to untie Charlie, believing that she has won the game. He suddenly stabs her in the stomach and reveals himself as Ghostface, before leaving her for dead. Sidney, Jerry, Douglas and Kyle are confronted by Charlie and a second Ghostface, who is revealed as Jill. Jill explains that her motive was out of anger and jealousy because of the fame that Sidney and Jerry had received for surviving the murders, and that they intend to frame Trevor as Ghostface; she then pulls Trevor out of a closet and shoots him in the head. Jill then betrays Charlie and kills him, too, to pin him as Trevor's accomplice and to make herself the sole survivor. Jill stabs Sidney in the stomach, then shoots Jerry in the shoulder after he tried to take revenge on her, then she shoots Douglas in the arm and shoots Kyle in the leg and mutilates herself to make it seem as if Trevor attacked her, Later, Dewey, Judy, and the rest of the police stumble upon the carnage.\nSidney, Jerry, Douglas, Kyle and Jill are then taken to the hospital. After discovering that Sidney, Jerry, Douglas and Kyle had survived, she goes to Sidney and Jerry's hospital room and attempts to finish them. Dewey, Gale, Douglas, Kyle, and Judy intervene, having been clued by a detail about Gale's injury that Jill somehow knew. Jill subdues Sidney and Jerry's rescuers, which gives Sidney and Jerry the chance to shoot her in the chest, finally killing her. Dewey calls in all police units, as media reporters outside confirm Jill as \"the new Sidney Prescott\", a title that would be short lived, and after Jill's death Jerry asks Denise to marry him and she accepts, Sidney, Douglas, Kyle, Judy, Gale and Dewey attended Jerry and Denise's wedding, and Denise became Denise Thompson-Prescott, and 6 months later Jerry and Denise have two kids named George Thomas Prescott and Jennifer Georgia Prescott and Sidney became an aunt of Jerry and Denise's kids."}

The village center of Vlamertinge lies just outside the city center of Ypres, along the main road N38 to the nearby town of Poperinge.\nIn addition to the city center of Ypres itself, Vlamertinge is the largest borough of Ypres. In the west of Vlamertinge, along the road to Poperinge, is the hamlet of Brandhoek.\nHistory.\nThe earliest data about Vlamertinge date from the Middle Ages. In 857 a chapel was built in Vlamertinge. In 970 Ypres was destroyed and the chapel of Vlamertinge burned down. The oldest document, known to date, which includes the name Flambertenges, is a deed of the year 1066. Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, his wife Adela and their son Baldwin, in this deed gave goods to the church and the Chapter (religion) from Sint-Pieters by Lille. These goods were, among others, a tenth located in Elverdinge and also a tenth located in Vlamertinge - \"In territorio Furnensi, in villa Elverzenges, decinam unam ; Flambertenges decinam similiter unam\".\nIn the Ancien R\u00e9gime Vlamertinge was a \"Heerlijkheid\" of Veurne-Ambacht with 22 backlendings and suffered a lot from the sieges of nearby Ypres.\nDuring the First World War, the whole village was destroyed by bombing. In 1944, during the Second World War, Vlamertinge was liberated by a Polish armored division.\nEtymology.\nVlamertinge would come from Flambert (a name) + inga (son, descendant of (genitive)) + heim (domicile). The oldest known spellings of the current Vlamertinge are: Flembertenges (1066), Flamertingha (1123), Flambertinghes (1142), Flamertinge (1154), Flamertinga (1185), Flamertinghe (1200), Flambertengues (1202), Flamertinghes (1238), Flamertinges (1269), Vlamertinghe (1272), Vlamertinghes (1275), Flamertenghe (1275), Vlamertincghe (1280), etc.\nGeography.\nVlamertinge is 17 meters above sea level. The municipality also borders Ypres in the East, Voormezele in the Southeast, Kemmel and Dikkebus in the South, Reningelst in the Southwest, Poperinge in the West, Elverdinge in the North and Brielen in the Northeast.\nDemographic developments.\nFrom 1487 to 1697 we see a large decline in the population of Vlamertinge. The most plausible explanation for this would have been the Eighty Years' War in the Seventeen Provinces.\nEconomy.\nThere are 70 to 80 stores in Vlamertinge. In Vlamertinge there is a large company Valcke that makes concrete constructions and therefore also offers employment for many people in the village.\nPolitics.\nMayors.\nVlamertinge had its own municipal council and mayor until the mergers of 1977. Mayors were:\nNickname.\nPeople speak of \"Vlamertingse Pottebrekers\"(Vlamertingisch pot crushers), and the pots that are meant here are obviously beer pots."}

Pliny the Elder (d. 79 AD near Pompeii) called fossils of these animals \"ammonis cornua\" (\"horns of Ammon\") because the Egyptian god Ammon (Amun) was typically depicted wearing ram's horns.
