It shared the fate of many other large mammals, whose extinction is attributed to hunting and climate change.\nDNA studies show that the Columbian mammoth was a hybrid between woolly mammoths and another lineage descended from steppe mammoths. This hybridization happened more than 420,000 years ago.\nThese mammoths did not live in the Arctic regions of Canada, where the woolly mammoth lived. The ranges of the two species may have overlapped, and genetic evidence suggests that they interbred. Several sites have the skeletons of more than one Columbian mammoths. Maybe they died in incidents such as a drought, or perhaps these places were natural traps where individuals tended to die."}

For example, the function formula_1 is a constant function because the value of \u00a0formula_2 \u00a0is 4 regardless of the input value formula_3 (see image).\nBasic properties.\nFormally, a constant function \"f\"(\"x\"):R\u2192R has the form \u00a0formula_4. Usually we write formula_5 \u00a0or just \u00a0formula_6. \nExample: The function \u00a0formula_7 \u00a0or just \u00a0formula_8 \u00a0is the specific constant function where the output value is \u00a0formula_9. The domain is all real numbers \u211d. The codomain is just {4}. Namely, \"y\"(0)=4, \"y\"(\u22122.7)=4, \"y\"(\u03c0)=4... No matter what value of \"x\" is input, the output is \"4\".\nDerivative of a constant function.\nIn the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function measures the rate of change of function (output) values with respect to change in input values. A constant function does not change, so its derivative is 0. This is often written: \u00a0formula_12\u00a0.\nExample: \u00a0formula_13\u00a0 is a constant function. The derivative of \"y\" is the identically zero function \u00a0 formula_14 \u00a0.\nThe converse (opposite) is also true. That is, if the derivative of a function is zero everywhere, then the function is a constant function.\nMathematically we write these two statements: \nGeneralization.\nA function \"f\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" is a constant function if \"f\"(\"a\") = \"f\"(\"b\") for every \"a\" and \"b\" in \"A\".\nExamples.\nReal-world example: A store where every item is sold for 1 euro. The domain of this function is \"items in the store\". The codomain is \"1 euro\".\nExample: Let \"f\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" where \"A\"={X,Y,Z,W} and \"B\"={1,2,3} and \"f\"(\"a\")=3 for every \"a\"\u2208\"A\". Then \"f\" is a constant function.\nExample: \"z\"(\"x\",\"y\")=2 is the constant function from \"A\"=\u211d\u00b2 to \"B\"=\u211d where every point (\"x\",\"y\")\u2208\u211d\u00b2 is mapped to the value \"z\"=2. The graph of this constant function is the horizontal plane (parallel to the \"x\"0\"y\" plane) in 3-dimensional space that passes through the point (0,0,2).\nExample: The polar function \"\u03c1\"(\"\u03c6\")=2.5 is the constant function that maps every \"angle\" \u03c6 to the \"radius\" \u03c1=2.5. The graph of this function is the circle of radius 2.5 in the plane.\nOther properties.\nThere are other properties of constant functions. See on English Wikipedia"}

He first published it in 1839 as his Journal and Remarks.\nThe title refers to the second survey expedition of the ship HMS \"Beagle\". The ship set sail from Plymouth Sound on 27 December 1831 under the command of Captain Robert FitzRoy R.N.\nThe expedition was originally planned to last two years, but it lasted almost five. The \"Beagle\" did not return until 2 October 1836. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land (three years and three months on land; 18 months at sea). The ship dropped him off at various places and picked him up later.\nThe book is a vivid and exciting travel memoir as well as a detailed scientific field journal. It includes biology, geology, and anthropology. Darwin's observations were written at a time when Western Europeans were exploring and charting the whole world. Although Darwin revisited some areas during the expedition, for clarity the chapters of the book are ordered by places and locations rather than by date.\nDarwin's notes made during the voyage include comments illustrating his thinking. Looking at the plants, animals, rocks and fossils, he ran across questions which he could not answer at the time. On his way back, ideas began in his mind which he developed later as his theory of evolution by natural selection. The second edition of 1845 includes some suggestion of this.\nLater, he realised he had made a big mistake in not noting which islands some specimens from the Galapagos Islands were found on. He knew this was a mistake because he had sensed how islands were rather like the higher parts of mountains, which also have many unique species. The idea we now know as geographical speciation was beginning to form in his mind. Darwin opened his secret 'transmutation' notebook (Notebook 'B') in July 1837, less than a year after the \"Beagle\" returned to England."}

Also poi refers to both a style of performing art and the equipment used for engaging in poi performance. As a skill toy poi is an object or theatrical prop used for dexterity play or an object manipulation.\nPoi spinning is a type of object manipulation or performance art. It involves using a set of weights on strings. Many people use beanbags in long socks. These are called a set of poi. People spin the poi around their body drawing shapes in the air.\nLED lights or fire is sometimes used to make the poi easier to see and more exciting to watch.\nUseful moves with poi spinning.\nWalk or jump while spin poi. Do dance moves. Stay in same place but move spin image everywhere and in all directions. Move body with poi or arms. If hands go right, move body to right. Spin slow or fast. Straighten your arms. Add difficulty like for example stay in 1 leg. Lie down on the ground and spin. \nIf spinner will make all this moves while he is training some trick he will feel more confident with the trick. Also spinner will learn trick faster, will be able to change this trick to other tricks more easily. \nWhat can help to spin poi.\nThis can help to make many poi tricks.\nThis can help to make poi tricks.\nWhat abilities increases with poi spinning.\nPoi can develop rhythm, balance, concentration, coordination, grace, body stretches, grip strength, attention . Some poi tricks like complex atomic tricks can develop skill of solving geometric puzzles. \nWhere poi spinning is useful.\nBesides increasing abilities, poi can be useful like a physical activity. Physical activity increases when spinner spin much more heavy poi, spin fast, add body moves.\nPoi can be used as art of drawing shapes in the air. This can be done by taking photos on exposure when spinner spin LED or fire poi.\nSpinning more than 2 poi.\nWhen spinner grab 2 or more poi in 1 hand he can have 3 poi or more poi in 2 hands. \nThis can be useful in these cases :\nHow to divide trick into steps.\nTo divide trick into steps will help you to make it. You need to select and remember all positions of each poi when some of 2 poi is at most bottom position. Let's say trick is repeated per N bit cycle. Between beats of left poi there is time T. Lets say left poi head is at most bottom position at moment M1. So you can select dots of both poi heads at moment M1. Next moment M2 be after time T/2 because poi move in split time. You can in same way select dots of poi at moment M2. Each new moment will be after time T/2 relative to previous moment. In all trick cycle there will be 2N moments. at moment Mx poi head is at position Px and have diction Dx. x is some number. At moment M3 position is P3 and diction is D3. At any moment Mx there will be direction of movement of poi. This direction is like arrow in 3d space or vector. \nFor example, for 3 bit wave there will be 6 moments. For 3b wave you will have 6 position and 6 directions for each poi head.\nWhen you spin trick, you should pay attention to each moment and at each moment pay attention that poi heads moves in correct direction."}

On May 15, 2011, he became Cultural Counselor and Head of Educational Mission at the Embassy of Egypt in Berlin.\nEarly life and education.\nHe attended high school in Cairo. In 1979, he registered at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University. In July 1981, he was looking for a summer job as a student. He went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and met with Dr. Mohamed Saleh, the vice director of the museum. He worked there for one month. In summer 1982, he worked at the museum again for a summer student job. He did work that brought him in contact with all departments of the museum. In 1983, he graduated at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University.\nAfter his graduation, he worked again for the museum for one month for free. After that, he joined the restoration team of the Coptic Museum for several months. In January 1984, he started his 15 month long conscription service. He worked at the museum again from April 1985 to September 1987. He rejoined his Faculty at Cairo University to resume higher studies. The thesis of his Master's Degree was \"St- Meskhnet hall at Dendara Temple, linguistic and cultural study\" under supervision of Prof. Abdelhalim Noureldin and partnership of Dr. Ola El-Aguizy.\nThrough his work at the Museum he became acquainted to many Egyptologists and archaeologists who visited the Museum. Among those was Prof. Erich Winter at Trier University, who along with his wife visited Egypt in 1987 and were accompanied by the young Mamdouh Eldamaty during their 3-day visit to Siwa Oasis. This new contact proved to be quite useful as Prof. Winter encouraged the young Egyptologist to continue his studies under his supervision at the Department of Egyptology at Trier University.\nIn October 1988 he worked as a curator at Faculty of Archaeology Museum of Cairo University. During his work he got his Master Degree in April 1989 in Egyptology from the same faculty. Immediately he left Egypt for Germany on leave to prepare his PhD. \nTrying his luck without any state sponsored scholarship it was rather difficult to get an entry visa to study in Germany without guarantor. Thanks to the help and support of his Professor and guarantor, Prof. Dr. Mohamed Saleh, an entry visa was issued and he started his German courses at Cologne University as soon as he arrived to Germany. He supported his life by working during summer vacation. While in Cologne he held correspondence with Trier University. He got an acceptance from Trier University, which he joined from winter semester 1989/ 1990. He started his Trier residence by learning German until he acquired the \u2018Pr\u00fcfung zum Nachweis der Deutsch Sprachkenntnis\u2019 that qualified him to regular study at the university. He registered for Egyptology as major subject with classical archaeology and ethnology as minor subject in summer semester 1991.\nAt the winter semester 1992/ 93 he registered for his PhD with thesis \u2018Sokar- Osiris- Kapelle im Tempel von Dendera\u2019 for which he received a study scholarship from Ministry of Culture at Rhineland Palatia that enabled him to conclude his study in June 1995. \nDuring his stay in Germany, on February 26th 1992 he married Aida Abdelghany Ahmed, who studied sociology at Zagazig University. She accompanied him to Germany where gave birth to their first daughter, Mariam (11.Feb. 1993) in Trier.\nHaving concluded his PhD, he returned to Egypt in September 1995 but kept visiting Trier frequently in the years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2007 in order to follow recent publications and studies on Egyptology.\nBack in Cairo, where the family got a son and another daughter, he resumed his work for the Faculty\u2019s Museum until January 1996.\nStarting from January 1996 he started as lecturer for Egyptology at Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, Cairo University, Fayoum Branch. Upon founding an archaeological department at the Faculty of arts, Ain Shams University in August 1998, he moved to the new department as a lecturer for Egyptology until end of 2001.\nCareer.\nDirector General of Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\nAt the beginning of 2001 he was appointed Director General of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, a post that he held until End of January 2004.\nDuring his directorship the Museum witnessed several far reaching activities, developing its cellar (April 2001), restoration of old records of the Museum (May 2001), preparing for the second chamber for royal mummies (June 2001) and establishing restoration laboratory for papyrus, in cooperation with Corrado Basile, Director of Istituto Internazionale del Papiro, Siracusa in Italy (March 2003).\nIn July 2001 he laid forward a concept for the centennial of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which included several projects to promote and develop the old institution. This concept was approved by Dr. Gaballa Ali Gaballa, the then Secretary General of the Higher Council for Monuments and by the Minister of Culture as well.\nThese activities were performed in late 2002 in the time of the successor of Gaballa, Dr. Zahi Hawas, who gave this ceremony special attention.\nEldamaty was assigned also to supervise the external exhibitions committee from May 2002 till February 2004.\nProfessor at Ain Shams University.\nHaving concluded his assignment at the Egyptian Museum he returned to his main work in teaching at the Ain Shams University. There he got the post of associate professor of Egyptology at the Faculty of Arts from 25.03.2001 till 20.08.2006. As of 21.08.2006 he became a full professor of Egyptology and presided over the archaeological Department of Faculty of Arts at Ain Shams University from 12.09.2006 till 12.09.2009.\nBesides he was assigned to head the college center for studies, consultations and training from 15.10.2008 till 13.10.2009 when he overtook the post of director of open education center from 22.03.2009 till 15.11.2009.\nStarting from 13.09.2009 till 14.05.2011 he was the Dean of Faculty of Arts at the Ain Shams University. During his deanship he supervised the project for sustainable development and qualifying for Accreditation. This sustainable development specified certain criteria for selection of university cadres, which was approved by the college council, albeit not by the university council due to the political conditions accompanying the Arab spring in January 2011.\nFollowing the revolution he organized the first election process in Egyptian universities to choose his successor as Dean of the Faculty in March 2011, as he left the country on 15.05.2011 in the capacity of cultural counselor at the Egyptian Embassy to Berlin and head of educational mission there.

Demonstrations in Phnom Penh have taken place against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. These were because many reasons, including widespread claims of election fraud during the Cambodian general election of 2013. Protesters want the minimum wage raised to $160 a month. There is also resentment over Vietnamese influence in Cambodia. Also, Cambodia is a very poor country and the government is not doing much to address the issues. The main opposition party, CNRP (Cambodia National Rescue Party), refused to participate in parliament after the elections. Major demonstrations took place all through December 2013. The government took action in January 2014. This led to the deaths of 4 people and the clearing of the main protest camp.\nBackground.\nHun Sen has been the prime minister of Cambodia for 28 years. He is the leader of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP). In 2013 he was challenged by Sam Rainsy leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). On 28 July 2013 general elections were held in Cambodia. The ruling Cambodian People's Party claimed victory by winning 68 seats in Parliament. The Cambodia National Rescue Party won 55 seats. They then rejected the election results and boycotted the opening of parliament. The CNRP claimed there had been irregularities with the voting. The European Union (E.U.) and the United States also expressed concern about possible fraud. The international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch called for an 'independent commission' to investigate charges of election fraud.\nSeptember 2013.\nSecurity police clashed with Cambodian protesters when the police blocked the two main roads near the Kbal Thnal Bridge leading into Phnom Penh. Police shot and killed one protester wearing a yellow headband with the word, \u201cWe demand Justice\u201d. Three others were seriously injured. Ten people were arrested. Police used firearms, tear gas and against the protesters. The protesters smashed a barrier in the middle of a road. They also threw rocks, shoes and other objects at the police. One policeman was injured. This clash happened the day before the scheduled talks between Prime Minister Hun Sen and CRNP leader Sam Rainsy.\nNovember 2013.\nA woman was shot and nine others were wounded when clothing workers in Phnom Penh protested . About 100 police blocked some 600 protesters who were airing their complaints over low pay and poor working conditions along Stung Meanchey road. Police fired live bullets and tear gas to rescue fellow officers. Protesters threw rocks at police. When protesters retreated into a pagoda police fired tear gas into the building. Buddhist monks joined in the protests also throwing rocks at police. More than a dozen people including several monks were arrested.\nDecember, 2013.\nOn 27 December striking garment workers and police officers clashed on a road on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The opposition party organised large protests in Phnom Penh during December, including motorbike rallies. The government called the protests illegal and stated that they were 'inciting anarchy'.\nJanuary 2014.\nOn 3 January at least four people were shot to death and 20 others were injured when police opened fire to break up a protest by garment workers. The workers were demanding their minimum wage be doubled. They had blocked the road with burning tires. Protesters also threw objects at police. By this time most of the workers at Cambodia's 500 factories were on strike. The demand was still for a $160 a month in minimum wage while the government had offered $100. This was the second day of strikes and clashes with police. The opposition party and anti-government protesters have close ties with the labor movement. Unions representing disgruntled garment workers joined the protest with opposition supporters against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. They want a re-run of the July election. Sam Rainsy, CNRP leader promised to nearly double wage to $160 if CNRP wins a re-election.\nOn 4 January a camp occupied by anti-government demonstrators was taken down by Cambodian officials. The camp was in Freedom Park. Hundreds of CNRP supporters started occupying the space on 15 December. It is the only place in Phnom Penh that allowed protests. Protesters fled with their belongings as they saw police approaching. Police did not enter the park, but allowed security guards and city workers to take down the stage and clear the grounds. In spite of the clearing of the park a rally planned for Sunday would go ahead according to Rainsy. At that rally at least eight people injured. On 6 January a protest was led by radio station owner Mam Sonando. They gathered in front of the Cambodia Ministry of Information to demand a license for a television channel. The government rejected the application saying that there was no frequency available. All local TV channels are closely linked to Prime Minister Hun Sen."}

He was of Jewish descent.\nHis career began during the molecular biology revolution of the 1950s, and he eventually rose to prominence in the fields of molecular and behavioral genetics. He led a genetics research lab at Purdue University and at the California Institute of Technology.\nBenzer made fundamental discoveries in two quite different fields of genetics. He got his PhD in solid-state physics, but soon switched to genetics after he read Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's book \"What is Life?\"\nPhage genetics.\nAt Purdue University, Benzer developed the \"T4 rII system\", a new genetic technique. This used recombination in T4 bacteriophage rII mutants to map the inside structure of genes. Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains, he could make a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes.\nTaking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rII mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 rII mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. Based on his rII data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.\nBehavioral genetics.\nBenzer was one of the first scientists in the field of behavioral genetics. As the field began to emerge in the 1960s and 70s, Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the field's leading researchers, Jerry Hirsch.\nHirsch believed that behaviors were so complex they could not be explained as the action of single genes, Benzer thought behaviors might be directed by single genes. Both researchers tried their ideas out on \"Drosophila\". Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations, while Benzer used methods to isolate mutants for a particular behavior. Benzer and Hirsch's competing philosophies developed behavioral genetics, and helped it become a legitimate area of study in the scientific community.\nHonors and awards (selection).\nHe was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences."}

People who believe in this idea say that revelation that comes from scripture is more important than revelation that comes from other sources. Other sources include traditions, spiritual gifts, conscience, common sense and the views of experts. Prima scriptura suggests that there are ways of knowing or understanding God and his will that do not originate from canonized scripture. These may be helpful in interpreting that scripture, but that if they seem to contradict the scriptures, the scriptures should be used instead.\nPrima scriptura is sometimes mentioned together with Sola scriptura. Sola scriptura is a view mainly held by protestants which states that only scripture is the source of divine revelation. Sola scriptura rejects scripture which is not in the Bible, while prima scriptura says that there may be such scripture. "}

It is different from a civil war, where a single nation or ethnic group is fighting among itself.\nExamples of ethnic wars since the 1990s were typically caused by secessionist movements leading to the breakup of multi-ethnic states along ethnic lines: the Yugoslav Wars, the First Chechen War, the Nagorno-Karabakh War, the Rwandan Civil War and the War in Darfur, among others\nAcademic explanations of ethnic conflict generally fall into one of three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist or constructivist. Intellectual debate has also focused around the issue of whether ethnic conflict has become more common since the end of the Cold War, and on finding ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as consociationalism and federalisation."}

Williams", "text": "George Christopher Williams (May 12, 1926 \u2013 September 8, 2010) was an American evolutionary biologist.\nWilliams was a professor emeritus of biology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He was best known for his critique of group selection, though later in life he recognized that it did sometimes occur. The work of Williams in this area, with W.D. Hamilton, John Maynard Smith and others, led to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution.\nIn 1999 Williams shared the Crafoord Prize, with Maynard Smith and Ernst Mayr, for developing the concept of evolutionary biology.\nAcademic work.\nWilliams' 1957 paper \"Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence\" was influential in 20th century evolutionary biology. It contains three important ideas. In this paper Williams proposed that senescence should be generally synchronized by natural selection.\n\"if the adverse genic effects appeared earlier in one system than any other, they would be removed by selection from that system more readily than from any other. In other words, natural selection will always be in greatest opposition to the decline of the most senescence-prone system.\" \nThis paper also contains the first outline of the idea that natural selection might select for menopause and post-reproductive life in females, although Williams does not explicitly mention grandchildren or the inclusive fitness contribution of grandparenting. By helping grandchildren survive, grandparents promote the survival of an average of one-quarter (1/4) of their own genome.p100\nIn his first book, \"Adaptation and Natural Selection\", Williams advocated a \"ground rule or perhaps \"doctrine\" would be a better term ... that adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary\", and, that, when it is necessary, selection among genes or individuals would in general be the preferable explanation for it. This contributed to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution; Richard Dawkins built on Williams' ideas in this area in the book \"The Selfish Gene\".\nWilliams was also well known for his work on the evolution of sex, and was an advocate of evolutionary medicine."}

It was fought near the town of Lewes, in Sussex, England. The battle took place on 14 May 1264. It was one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons' War.\nBackground.\nThe two armies that met in the battle were led by King Henry III of England and a rebel leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Henry III's son, Prince Edward, fought on his side. The battle came about because many of the leading noblemen of England were unhappy with the way King Henry was ruling the country. They wanted more involvement in the government. The Barons voted to hold a Parliament regularly so that they could discuss subjects such as taxation. King Henry would not agree to this, and so both sides started to raise armies. When the two sides met at Lewes two days before, Simon de Montfort tried to arrange a truce with the king. King Henry refused and so both sides got ready to fight a battle. \nThe battle.\nThe king's army was nearly twice as big as the rebel army. The battle began when the Baronial forces attacked the king's . When the fighting started, it looked as though the king's army would win easily. Prince Edward, who was only 25, was headstrong and made one big mistake. Edward was in charge of the cavalry, who did well in the battle but then chased some of the rebels who were running away. By the time they came back to the battlefield, the rebels had managed to win the battle. With Edward off chasing foot soldiers, Henry was forced to attack using his two remaining divisions. Henry led one, the other was led by his brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall. Henry's division fought until driven back by the Baronial reserve forces. Cornwall's division did not do well from the start. Cornwall fled the field and hid in a windmill but was quickly captured by the barons. As a result of the battle, King Henry III was forced to sign a document called the Mise of Lewes. This gave the rebel barons what they wanted. A year later the barons were defeated at the Battle of Evesham.\nOther websites.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

This had very poor results until police schools were opened to teach officers how to use their vehicles properly. In 1910 the first police car in the US was used in Akron, Ohio. By 1920 police cars were in wide use in the US. It was noticed that patrol cars allowed police to respond faster. It also allowed an officer to cover a wider area. By the 1960s most major cities had shifted away from foot patrols altogether in favor of police cars. But studies proved a mix of foot officers and police vehicles worked best.\nChases.\nPolice cars are used for chases (\"pursuits\") against suspects. The crime the suspect is believed to have committed may have been anything from a to a major felony. Suspects often attempt to lose law enforcement by driving away, sometimes at high speed. From 1990 to 2005, 136 people were killed in the US in high speed pursuits by police. Despite controversy as to whether high speed chases are necessary police continue to work on the problem using technology and new techniques. One technique is the 'take out'. A take out is a technique used to cause the fleeing vehicle to lose control and be turned sideways by the police vehicle.\nWhen rushing to a crime scene, police officers can drive their cars through red lights and break the speed limit and other traffic laws. They must still be careful when doing this, however.\nOther names.\nTerms for police cars include (police) cruiser, squad car, area car and patrol car. They may also be informally known as a cop car, a 'Black and white', a 'Cherry top', a 'gumball machine', a 'jam sandwich' or 'panda car'. Depending on the configuration of the emergency lights and livery, a police car may be considered a marked or unmarked unit.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

{"id": "436664", "revid": "7407616", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436664", "title": "Linear function", "text": "In basic mathematics, a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line in 2-dimensions (2D, see images). An example is: \"y\"=2\"x\"\u20131. In higher mathematics, a linear function often refers to a linear mapping.\nBasic Properties.\nFormally, a linear function is a function \"f\"(\"x\"):R\u2192R such that the graph of \"f\" is a line. This means the domain or input of \"f\" is a real number R and the range or output of \"f\" is also a real number R. Usually we write \"y\"(\"x\") or just \"y\" in place of \"f\"(\"x\"). So the formal statement means:\nThere are three main forms for writing linear functions: slope-intercept, standard and parametric.\nSlope-intercept form.\nThe slope-intercept (also called point-slope or explicit) form of a linear function is \u00a0formula_1\u00a0 or \u00a0formula_2\u00a0. This form has 2 variables \"x\" and \"\u0443\" and 2 constants \"m\" and \"b\".\nExample: \"y\"=\u20132\"x\"+4. The slope is \"m\"= \u20132 and the \"y\"-intercept is \"b\"=4 or the point (0,4). Substituting \"y\"=0 and solving for \"x\", we get 0=\u20132\"x\"+4 or \"x\"=2. So \"x\"=2 is the root of this linear function and the point (2,0) is the \"x\"-intercept. Since the slope is \"m\" = \u20132, the line is decreasing. Since |\u20132|=2&gt;1, the decrease is \"relatively\" steep. For each change in \"\u0445\" of 1 (to the right), the value of \"\u0443\" changes -2 (goes down).\nExample: \"y\"=\u20132\"x\"+4. Substituting \"x\"=0 we get \"y\"=4 (this is the \"y\"-intercept) and thus the point (0,4). Substituting \"x\"=1, we get \"y\"=2 and thus the point (1,2). Plot these points and draw the line. (Notice that the 2nd point is 1 to the right and 2 down from the 1st point. As we said in the above example, this happens because the slope is \"m\"= \u20132)\nExample: \"y\"= \u2013\"x\"+2. Suppose \"y\"= \u20131. We substitute \"y\"= \u20131 and get: \u20131= \u2013'x\"+2 or \"x\"=3. This is the only solution. We can do this for any \"y\"-value.\nStandard form.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0formula_3.\nExample: The linear function 3\"x\"\u20132\"y\"=1 is in standard form. The constants are \"A\"=3, \"B\"=\u20132 and \"C\"=1.\nExample: The lines 3\"x\"\u20132\"y\"=1 and 6\"x\"\u20134\"y\"=2 are coincident (same line). Here the factor is: \"k\"=2. We multiplied the first equation by 2 to get the second equation. The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: \"y\"=1.5\"x\"\u20130.5 (solve either equation for y).\nVector-Parametric form.\nParametric form: formula_5 \u00a0\u00a0 or\nVector form: formula_6 \u00a0or\u00a0 formula_7\u00a0.\nExample: X=(\u20131,1)+\"t\"(2,3), t\u2208R is a line in vector form. Here: \"a\"1=2, \"a\"2=3, \"x\"1=\u20131 and \"x\"2=1. The line goes through the points (\"x\"1,\"y\"1)=(\u20131,1) and (\"x\"1+\"a\"1,\"y\"1+\"a\"2)=(1,4). The corresponding parametric form of this line is: \"x\"(\"t\")= \u20131+2\"t\", \"y\"(\"t\")=1+3\"t\". The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: \"y\"(\"x\")=1.5\"x\"+2.5 \u00a0 (solve the first equation for \"t\" and substitute this result into the second equation).\nExample: X=(\u20131,1,2)+\"t\"(2,3,\u20131), t\u2208R is a line in 3-dimensional space. The line goes through the points (\u20131,1,2) and (1,4,1).\nDerivative of a linear function.\nIn the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function is a measure of the rate of change of function values with respect to change in input values. A linear function has a constant rate of change. This rate of change is the slope \"m\". So \"m\" is the derivative. This is often written:\nExample: \"y\"= \u20132\"x\"+4. Here \"m\"= \u20132 and so \"y\"\u2032= \u20132.\nLinear function vs. Linear equation.\nOften, the terms \"linear equation\" and \"linear function\" are confused. Both are polynomials. However, the word \"linear\" in \"linear equation\" means that all terms with variables are first degree. (The word \"linear\" in \"linear function\" means the graph is a line.) A linear equation can have 1, 2, 3, or more variables. So a linear equation is a linear function only if it has exactly 2 variables. (A linear equation in one variable is a point on the number line and a linear equation in 3 variables is a plane in 3-dimensional space.)\nNotation.\nMany countries and disciplines use different letters and ordering for the different forms.\nIn many countries, a linear functions is often written as formula_9 where \"a\" is the slope and \"b\" is the \"y\"-intercept.\nIn business and economics, a linear function is often written as formula_10 where \"a\" is the \"y\"-intercept and \"b\" is the slope."}

He first went to school at age 12, going to Victoria College four years later to study science and the arts. He later went to Christ's College in Cambridge to study law.\nBoer War and Unification.\nSmuts was a supporter of Cecil Rhodes until it was revealed that he was apart of the Jameson Raid by a group of Uitlanders (\"foreigners\" in Afrikaans) in the Transvaal Republic. In 1898, Smuts moved to Johannesburg in the Transvaal to practice law and later became a minister in the Transvaal government until the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War.\nDuring the Boer War, he led a Boer Commando in the Cape Colony using guerrilla tactics. After the war, Smuts joined the cabinet led by Louis Botha in 1907. However, uneasiness with his Afrikaner comrades cooperating with the British led him to disown the Afrikaners on year later, declaring himself to be South African instead.\nSoldier and Statesman.\nTwo years after the Union of South Africa was formed, Smuts created the Union Defence Force (UDF). He led the UDF and was instrumental in the conquest of German South-West Africa and German East Africa during World War I. In 1917, Smuts was invited to join the Imperial War Cabinet. In 1918, Smuts helped created the Royal Air Force.\nSmuts and Botha were key negotiators at the Paris Peace Conference. After signing the Treaty of Versailles, which gave South Africa control over Namibia, Smuts returned to politics.\nWhen Botha died in 1919, Smuts became Prime Minister, serving until his defeat in 1924 to the National Party.\nWorld War II.\nAfter serving nine years in opposition, Smuts became Deputy Prime Minister in a coalition government led by Barry Hertzog.\nWhen Hertzog asked for neutrality towards Nazi Germany during World War II, he was deposed and Smuts became Prime Minister again. During World War II, Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet again, where he worked closely with Winston Churchill. In 28 May 1941, Smuts became a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. This cooperation with Churchill made Smuts very unpopular with the Afrikaners, which led to his downfall.\nIn May 1945, Smuts represented South Africa during the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations. Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international organisation to preserve peace. Smuts signed the Paris Peace Treaty, becoming the only person to sign the treaties that ended both the First and Second World Wars.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter World War II, Smuts continued to represent South Africa internationally. Smuts was in favour of Zionism and his government quickly recognized the newly formed State of Israel after its establishment in May 1948. However, his support for the war and plans to change racial segregation in South Africa made him very unpopular with the Afrikaners, and in 1948, lost the election to Daniel Francois Malan and the pro-Apartheid National Party.\nSmuts died on 11 September 1950 from a heart attack on his family farm."}

It was the first flying medical service in the world. It provides emergency and other health care to people living in rural and remote areas. It is a not-for-profit organisation.\nCommunities in the Outback and the bush are generally small, and spread over large distances. Many farms, stations and outstations are located far from towns over rough trails. Because of this, many of these places do not have access to hospitals or doctors. The Flying Doctor Service brings medical service to them. It can land planes in any community that has an airstrip.\nToday it has a fleet of about 60 planes. They fly from 21 bases located across Australia.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe service was started by Reverend John Flynn. He had worked in rural areas of Victoria. In 1912, he was asked by the Presbyterian Church to look at the needs of people living in the Northern Territory. His report about it led to the creation of the Australian Inland Mission (AIM). Flynn became the manager of this. It began as one nursing clinic. By 1926, it had become a network of ten nursing clinics.\nOn 15 May 1928, Flynn formed the AIM Aerial Medical Service. This was an experiment based in Cloncurry, in Queensland. AIM leased a de Havilland DH.50 plane from the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service (Qantas). The plane was named \"Victory\". It would fly doctors to remote communities. The service answered its first call on 17 May 1928. From Cloncurry, the plane flew to Julia Creek in central Queensland. Within its first year of operations, the service flew more than 30,000\u00a0kilometres in 50 flights. It became the world's first flying ambulance service.\nFrom the mid-1920s, Flynn had been experimenting with radio together with Alfred Traeger. Traeger built the first pedal-powered transmitter in 1929. It allowed people in remote places to contact a central medical base. These transmitters were given out gradually to stations, missions and other communities around Cloncurry. Cloncurry was the base site for a large transmitter.\nSupport.\nDuring its first few decades, the service got most of its money from community fundraising, volunteers and donations. Today, the service gets financial help from the federal and state governments. But it still needs money from fundraising and donations from the community.\nUntil the 1960s, the service mostly leased planes and pilots. After this point, the service moved on to buying its own equipment and employing its own pilots and mechanics.\nGrowth.\nBy the early 1930s, there was growing interest in expanding the service across the continent. Demand for its services was increasing. In response, the service expanded its fleet by hiring more planes and more pilots. Money from fundraising and the Australian Government helped to finance the project. In 1934, it became the Australian Aerial Medical Service. It opened up new bases across the country, in Wyndham, Port Hedland, Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill, Alice Springs, Meekatharra, Charters Towers and Charleville. These bases were organised into \"sections\". A council to manage the organisation was formed in 1936.\nThe service's name was changed to the Flying Doctor Service in 1942. It was given the honorific \"Royal\" in 1955."}

Thomas Henry Huxley in the 1860s had thought birds evolved from dinosaurs, based on a comparison of \"Archaeopteryx\" with \"Compsognathus\". Huxley's idea was later discarded, mainly because Heilmann, in 1926, had different views.\nThe first of Ostrom's reviews of the osteology and phylogeny of the primitive bird \"Archaeopteryx\" appeared in 1976. After the modern discoveries of fossil dinobirds in China, the HuxleyOstrom theory was accepted by almost all palaeontologists.\nOstrom was a professor at Yale University. He was the Curator Emeritus of vertebrate paleontology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which has an impressive fossil collection started by Othniel Charles Marsh. He died from complications of Alzheimer's disease.\nDiscoveries.\nHis 1964 discovery of \"Deinonychus\" was one of the most important fossil finds in history. \"Deinonychus\" was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its \"terrible claw\". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. The conclusion that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and were therefore warm-blooded, was popularized by his student Robert Bakker. This helped to change the impression of dinosaurs as the sluggish, slow, cold-blooded lizards which had prevailed since the turn of the century.\nThis changed how dinosaurs are seen by both professional dinosaur illustrators, and by the public. The find is also credited with triggering the \"dinosaur renaissance\", a term coined in a 1975 issue of \"Scientific American\" by Bakker. It describes the renewed interest in paleontology, which has lasted from the 1970s to the present.\nOstrom's interest in the dinosaur-bird connection started with his study of what is now known as the Haarlem \"Archaeopteryx\". Discovered in 1855, it was actually the first specimen recovered but, incorrectly labeled as \"Pterodactylus crassipes\", it languished in the Teyler's Museum in the Netherlands until Ostrom's 1970 paper (and 1972 description) correctly identified it as one of only eight \"first birds\" (counting the solitary feather).\nOstrom also studied fossilized trackways of the duckbilled dinosaur \"Hadrosaurus\". He decided they traveled in herds. To this extent they were social animals like many birds and mammals, but unlike lizards."}

Her mother, Rachel Messerer, was a silent movie actress and her father, Mikhail Plisetski, was a diplomat. She studied at the Bolshoi Theater.\nFamily.\nIn 1938, her father was arrested and later executed during the Stalinist purges. Her mother was arrested soon after and, with Maya's seven-month-old baby brother, sent to a gulag in Kazakhstan for the next three years. Plisetskaya was taken in by her maternal aunt (a ballerina) until her mother was released in 1941. \nDuring the years without her parents, and barely a teenager, Plisetskaya \"faced terror, war, and dislocation\". As a result, \"Maya took refuge in ballet and the Bolshoi Theatre\".\nDancing.\nFor many years she was not allowed to tour outside the Soviet Union. This ban was lifted in 1959 by Nikita Khrushchev. \nAble to travel the world as a member of the Bolshoi, her skill as a dancer was widely recognised. It set a high standard for ballerinas in technique and dramatic presence. Khrushchev allowed her to go on the Bolshoi tour in New York and he was immensely satisfied upon reading the reviews of her performances. He embraced her on her return.\nWithin a few years, she was recognized as \u201can international superstar\u201d and a continuous \u201cbox office hit throughout the world\u201d. The Soviet Union treated her as a favored cultural emissary, as \u201cthe dancer who did not defect\u201d. Although she toured extensively during the years that other dancers defected, including Rudolph Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Plisetskaya always returned to Russia.\nPlisetskaya explains that for her generation, and her family in particular, defecting was a moral issue. She had once asked her mother why their family didn't leave the Soviet Union when they had the chance, at the time living in Norway. Her mother said \u201cMisha would never have been a traitor\u201d.\nPersonal life.\nPlisetskaya married composer Rodion Shchedrin in 1958. They lived in Munich, Germany. She was close friends with Robert F. Kennedy.

{"id": "437217", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=437217", "title": "Metre Convention", "text": "The Metre Convention is the treaty that set up the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The BIPM is an inter-governmental organization that is responsible for harmonizing systems of measurement across the world. The treaty was first made in 1875 between 17 countries. \nThe member countries agreed to share the costs of running a laboratory on neutral territory. The international prototype metre and the international prototype kilogram would be kept at the laboratory. Member state's national prototype metres and kilograms would be compared with the international prototypes at regular intervals. Member states would have regular meetings to discuss developments in measurement technology.\nIn 1921 the treaty was extended to cover electrical and all other physical measurements. This enabled the BIPM to published the standards for the International System of Units (SI). Under SI, units of measurements that are used in science and engineering were defined in a logical manner. The rules for SI also standardized the way in which physical quantities are written.\nIn 2014 the BIPM had 55 member countries.\nBefore the treaty.\nThe metric system was developed in France in the 1790s. The length of the metre was made to be one ten millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the equator. Between 1791 and 1798 the French men Delambre (a mathematician and astronomer) and M\u00e9chain (an astronomer) measured the distance between Dunkirk and Barcelona. The measurements were used to make a metal bar exactly 443.296 \"lignes\" long (the \"ligne\" is an old French unit of length equal to one twelfth of a French inch). The bar would be used as a standard for the metre. The bar was later called the \"metre des archives\". By the 1860s it was found that the \"metre des archives\" was 0.03% shorter than it was supposed to have been.\nThe Great Exhibition in London in 1851 and the Paris International Exhibition in 1867 had shown the need for different nations to use the same units of measurement. In the 1860s there were many discussions by astronomers and surveyors from outside France whether they should use the \"metre des archives\" or whether they should use a \"new metre\" that took account of the 0.03% error. Prussia took the lead in organizing conferences in Berlin to discuss the matter. France did not take part in the conferences. Before any actions could be taken the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Prussia defeated France and the German Empire was formed.\nIn 1875 France invited representatives to Paris to discuss the matter. This helped France to score a diplomatic victory over Prussia and the German Empire.\nTreaty details.\nThe treaty was signed by seventeen of the countries at the conference in Paris on 20 May 1875. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands went to the conference but did not sign the treaty at that time. After further consideration, the United Kingdom did sign the treaty in 1884.\nThe meeting agreed:\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).\nThe organization set up by the treaty was the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. Its French name is \"Bureau international des poids et mesures\". Its abbreviation is BIPM. The BIPM has its headquarters at the Pavillon de Breteuil, S\u00e8vres, France (close to Paris). About 70 people work at the BIPM. The budget for 2013 was over \u20ac10\u00a0million ($12\u00a0million).\nThe three organisations were set up under the treaty. They are:\nThe Bureau has responsibility for safeguarding the international prototype kilogram.\nThe official language for the organisations is French. Until 1988 all reports of meetings were only published in French. Since then both English and French have been used. Abbreviations are based on the French words, not English words. Official communications between the BIPM and France are conducted via the French Foreign Ministry. Official communications with other countries are conducted via that country's embassy in Paris.\nGeneral Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).\nThe General Conference on Weights and Measures was set up under the Metre Convention as an organ of the BIPM. It gives the BIPM its mandate and budget on behalf of the member states. Its French name is \"Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures\". Its abbreviation is \"CGPM\".\nThe CGPM meets every four to six years. The first meeting was in 1889 and the 24th meeting was in 2011. Each member state has one vote. France is represented by its foreign minister and by the president of the French Academy. The French Foreign minister is the chairman of the opening and closing sessions of any CGPM session. The president of the French Academy is the chairman of other meetings of the CGPM. \nThe CGPM:\nInternational Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM).\nThe International Committee for Weights and Measures was set up under the Metre Convention as an organ of the BIPM. It advises the CGPM and supervise the BIPM. Its French name is \"Comit\u00e9 international des poids et mesures\". Its abbreviation is CIPM.\nThe CGPM has 18 members. These members are well-known measurement experts who are elected by the CGPM. They must all come from different countries. One of the CIPM members must be French. They meet once or twice a year in Paris. The CIPM is assisted by a number of Consultative Committees. In February 2014 there were ten such committees. Nine of the committees are dedicated to special types of measurement such as Electricity and Magnetism, Length, Photometry and Radiometry, Thermometry and Time and Frequency. The CIPM appoints people to these committees.\nThe tenth committee is called the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU). Its chairman is appointed by the CIPM. Other members of the committee are appointed by other organizations. These organizations include International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CCU's task is to ensure that all the definitions of SI are consistent. It also drafts the SI standard which is called the \"SI Brochure\".\nPavillon de Breteuil.\nThe BIPM's offices and laboratories art at the Pavillon de Breteuil, S\u00e8vres, France (close to Paris). \nThe BIPM looks after the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) for the CGPM. It provides laboratory services for the CGPM and CIPM. Member states use the BIPM laboratories when they check their own copy of the kilogram against the IPK. The BIPM offices are also the headquarters for the CGPM and CIPM.\nActivities.\nIn 1875 the convention only dealt with standardization of the kilogram and the metre. The convention was revised in 1921 to accommodate all physical measurements. In 1933 the CGPM approved efforts that were being made to merge electrical and photometry units into the metric system.\nDevelopment of SI.\nDuring the late nineteenth and early twentieth century many new units of measure were defined using the metric system. Units of measure used in electrostatic applications, electromagnetic applications and electrical distribution systems were incompatible with each other. The use of standard gravity in force and pressure definitions resulted in more units of measure being defined than were necessary. \nAfter the Second World War the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the French Government asked the BIPM to look into the matter. In 1948, the 9th CGPM asked the CIPM to conduct a study into units of measurement used by member states. The CIPM reported back and in 1954 the 10th CGPM decided to set up a new system of units. There would be six base units. These were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (later renamed kelvin), and candela. The new system was published in 1960. The 11th CGPM named it the \"International System of Units\". The short name was \"SI\". This came from the French name, . The BIPM described SI as \"the modern metric system\".\nSince 1960 the BIPM has made several refinements to SI. Some of the refinements include developing new ways of making high precision measurement. Other refinements include small changes to details of definitions.\nCoordinating time.\nThe atomic clock has made very precise time-keeping possible. The earth is slowing down. A the \"time of the dinosaurs\" the earth rotated once every 23 hours. It is now possible to measure variations in the Earth's rotation caused by volcanoes and tsunamis. This is done by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). The IERS proposes leap seconds as and when these are needed. Under the Metre Convention, the BIPM has the task of coordinating over 200 atomic clocks around the world. These clocks are located in 50 different national laboratories.\nMutual Recognition Agreement (MRA).\nMany measuring devices need to be recalibrated at regular intervals. These devices might be petrol pumps. They might be weighing scales. They might be complex medical equipment like MRI scanners. A certificate is issued when the device is recalibrated. The device that is used to do the calibration must itself be calibrated. These devices are often recalibrated in a national metrology laboratory. Legal problems can arise if a calibration done in one country is not recognised in another country.\nMembership.\nSome countries are full members of the CGPM and have a vote at CGPM meetings. These countries have their own copy of the prototype kilogram. They also take part in the CIPM MRA program. \nOther countries are associate members. They take part on the CIPM MRA program. They may speak at CGPM meetings but not to vote at these meetings. They do not have their own copies of the prototype kilogram.\nMembers.\n (1877) &lt;br&gt;\n (1947)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt; \n (1921)&lt;br&gt;\n (1911)&lt;br&gt;\n (1907)&lt;br&gt;\n (1908)&lt;br&gt;\n (1977)&lt;br&gt;\n (2013)&lt;br&gt;\n (2008)&lt;br&gt;\n (1922)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1962)&lt;br&gt;\n (1923)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (2001)&lt;br&gt;\n (1925)&lt;br&gt;\n (1957)&lt;br&gt;\n (1960)&lt;br&gt;\n (1975)&lt;br&gt;\n (2013)&lt;br&gt;\n (1925)&lt;br&gt;\n (1985)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1885)&lt;br&gt;\n (2008)&lt;br&gt;\n (2010)&lt;br&gt;\n (2001)&lt;br&gt;\n (1890)&lt;br&gt;\n (1929)&lt;br&gt;\n (1991)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1973)&lt;br&gt;\n (1925)&lt;br&gt;\n (1876)&lt;br&gt;\n (1884)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (2011)&lt;br&gt;\n (2001)&lt;br&gt;\n (1994)&lt;br&gt;\n (1922)&lt;br&gt;\n (1964)&lt;br&gt;\n (1959)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1912)&lt;br&gt;\n (2012)&lt;br&gt;\n (1875)&lt;br&gt;\n (1884)&lt;br&gt;\n (1878)&lt;br&gt;\n (1908)&lt;br&gt;\n (1879)\nAssociate member states.\nAt its 21st meeting (October 1999), the CGPM created the category of \"associate\" for those states not yet members of the BIPM and for economic unions.\n (2007)&lt;br&gt;\n (2010)&lt;br&gt;\n (2003)&lt;br&gt;\n (2008)&lt;br&gt;\n (2011)&lt;br&gt;\n (2012)&lt;br&gt;\n (2005)&lt;br&gt;\n (2002)&lt;br&gt;\n (2004)&lt;br&gt;\n (2000)&lt;br&gt;\n (2000)&lt;br&gt;\n (2005)&lt;br&gt;\n (2008)&lt;br&gt;\n (2009)&lt;br&gt;\n (2000)&lt;br&gt;\n (2003)&lt;br&gt;\n (2001)&lt;br&gt;\n (2001)&lt;br&gt;\n (2014)&lt;br&gt;\n (2006)&lt;br&gt;\n (2001)&lt;br&gt;\n (2010)&lt;br&gt;\n (2013)&lt;br&gt;\n (2011)&lt;br&gt;\n (2012)&lt;br&gt;\n (2012)&lt;br&gt;\n (2003)&lt;br&gt;\n (2009)&lt;br&gt;\n (2009)&lt;br&gt;\n (2002)&lt;br&gt;\n (2007)&lt;br&gt;\n (2010)&lt;br&gt;\n (2003)&lt;br&gt;\n (2007)&lt;br&gt;\n (2012)&lt;br&gt;\n (2002)&lt;br&gt;\n (2003)&lt;br&gt;\n (2010)&lt;br&gt;\n (2010)\nInternational Organisations.\nThe following international organisations have signed the CIPM MRA:\nFormer member states.\n (1970\u20132012)&lt;br&gt;\n (1982\u20132012)&lt;br&gt;\n (1954-2014)&lt;br&gt;\n (2014-2018)"}

However, he then chose to play for Spain. This made the Brazil manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, very angry. The Brazilian Football Confederation have even asked the country's government to remove Costa's citizenship.\nIn March 2014, Costa changed to the Spanish national team. This was when he was granted his Spanish citizenship. He made his first appearance against Italy and represented Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nYouth career.\nCosta spent 2 years at Barcelona Esportivo Capela, from 2004 to 2006. After this, he then began his senior career in Portugal by joining Penafiel.\nSenior Career.\nPenafiel (Loan).\nIn the same year as joining Braga, he was sent on a loan spell to Penafiel. He played 13 league games with 5 goals.\nAtletico Madrid (2007-09).\nIn 2007, Costa joined Atletico Madrid for a fee of\u00a0\u20ac1.5 million. Unfortunately, he didn't get a games due to loan spells.\nBraga (Loan).\nDiego Costa remained at Braga in 2007 but on a loan spell. This time, he made 7 league appearances, but he failed to score a goal. In the UEFA Cup, he scored his first goal in a domestic cup against Parma F.C.\nCelta de Vigo (Loan).\nHe was then loaned to Celta for the 2007-08 Segunda Division season. In that season, he made an impressive 30 appearances and scored 5 goals.\nAlbacete (Loan).\nStaying in the Segunda Division, he then joined on loan Albacete Balompie for the 2008-09 season. At this loan spell, he made 35 league appearances and 9 goals.\nValladoid.\nCosta was bought by Valladoid from Atletico Madrid in 2009 Transfer Window. In this 2009-10 season, he made 34 league appearances with 8 goals. But it wasn't enough to keep Valladolid in La Liga, the top division in Spain. Valladolid was eventually relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n.\nReturn to Atletico Madrid.\nCosta returned to Atletico in June 2010 for an undisclosed fee. Since then, Costa has made a superb 94 league appearances and 43 league goals during his 4 year spell with the club. In his time, he suffered with a few injuries during his time. This include his hamstring injury he suffered near to the end of the 2013-14 La Liga season. \nChelsea.\nOn 1 July 2014, it was announced that Chelsea had agreed a fee with Atletico to sign Costa for a fee of \u00a332 million. He made his first league appearance against Burnley in a game which he scored in for Chelsea to win 3-1.\nInternational Career.\nDuring his international career, he started with the Brazilian National Team in 2013. He only made 2 appearances with no goals. But controversy was created when Costa was granted a Spanish Citizernship in 2014. Then, Costa adopted Spain as his national side. He made his debut against Italy on the 5 March 2014, Spain won 1-0. Costa was called-up to play for Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He started for both of the first two games of Spain's torlument against Holland and Chile, but was rested against Australia. Spain lost 5-1 against Holland And 2-0 against Chile. They did win 3-0 against Australia in their final group game, but it wasn't enough to keep them to progess into the knock out phases. Costa is still yet to score a goal for Spain during his time playing as a striker for the national side."}

Revolvers are repeating firearms with a cylinder that spins. Revolvers have several chambers each holding one cartridge. Most are handguns, but other types of weapons also use revolving cylinders. They are also called revolving guns, though \"revolver\" is used far more often. The first revolvers date back to late 1500s in Europe. It was not until the 1700s or 1800s, however, they became affordable. Revolvers are sometimes used by law enforcement agencies. On some occasions, these guns can be reset by one hand, then loaded with the other.\nAction.\nSingle-action.\nIn a single-action revolver, the hammer is manually cocked. This is usually done with the thumb. This action turns the cylinder to the next cartridge. It also locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called \"single-action\" because the trigger only performs a single action\u2014that of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is very light, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety. The gun will not fire unless the hammer is cocked back. The Colt Paterson Revolver, the Walker Colt, the Colt's Dragoon and the Colt Single Action Army pistol of the American Frontier era are all good examples of this system.\nDouble-action.\nIn double-action, the stroke of the trigger pull generates three actions: \nDouble-action means that a cocking action separate from the trigger pull is not needed. Every trigger pull causes a complete cycle and a bullet is fired. This allows the gun to be carried uncocked. It also allows the gun to be drawn from the holster and fired using only the trigger. However, a double-action revolver has a longer and harder trigger pull. However, this drawback can also be viewed as a safety feature, as the gun is safer against accidental discharges from being dropped.\nMost double-action revolvers may be fired in two ways."}

But some small frame revolvers only hold five cartridges, due to the smaller overall size of the gun. Several models of .22 rimfire caliber revolvers have cylinders holding nine or ten rounds.

She was one of the world's most successful players in the 1970s and early 1980s. She ranked No.\u00a01 in the world in 1976.\nGoolagong won 14 Grand Slam titles. She won the women's title in singles tennis four times at the Australian Open, twice at the Wimbledon Championships, and once at the French Open. The other Grand Slam titles she won were in doubles tennis: six in women's doubles and one in mixed doubles.\nEarly life.\nEvonne Fay Goolagong was born in Griffith, New South Wales. She and her family are Aboriginal Australians. They belong to the Wiradjuri nation. Evonne was the third of eight children. She grew up in the small farming town of Barellan. Her father, Kenneth Goolagong, was a sheep shearer. Her family was poor. At this time, many Aboriginal people around Australia faced discrimination; they were treated differently by White Australians. However, Goolagong has said that she did not experience discrimination whilst living at Barellan.\nShe started playing tennis when she was a young girl. A began when Bill Kurtzman, a player at Barellan, saw Goolagong looking through the fence of the local tennis courts. He asked her if she would like to try playing. She joined the local tennis club when she was seven years old. She quickly showed a talent for the game. She was fast and had quick reflexes. She played in competitions with neighbouring towns. In 1961, Vic Edwards, the owner of a tennis school in Sydney, travelled to Barellan to watch Goolagong play. She was eleven years old at the time.\nEdwards coached Goolagong and encouraged her to play tennis as a career. She left Barellan and moved to Sydney permanently in 1965, when she was aged 14. She lived with Edwards' family in their home. She went to Willoughby Girls High School, finishing in 1968. She entered the New South Wales Championship in 1967. She played in the Australian women's singles championship in January 1968. By this time she was ranked as the best junior player in New South Wales. Goolagong would later win the Australian championship four times; in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977. She came second place in 1971, 1972 and 1973.\nGrand Slam success.\nGoolagong won seven Grand Slam singles titles in her career. She played in eighteen Grand Slam singles finals; all except one of these were during the 1970s. Between 1971 and 1977, she reached the final of almost every Grand Slam singles event she entered.\nShe competed at Wimbledon for the first time in 1970. She won her first Grand Slam singles title in 1971, beating Helen Gourlay to win the French Open. A month later, she beat Margaret Court to win the Wimbledon Championship. The next year, she lost in the Wimbledon final to Billie Jean King. She lost to King again in the semi-final in 1973, and a third time in the final in 1975. She lost to Chris Evert in the final in 1976. She won the Wimbledon title for the second time in 1980, playing against Evert again in the final. Goolagong had given birth to her daughter in 1977. She became the first and only mother to win since Dorothea Douglass-Chambers 66 years before.\nGoolagong reached four U.S. Open finals; in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976. She lost them all: to Court, King, then twice to Evert. She is the only woman in the U.S. Open to have lost four finals one after the other. Goolagong made seven finals at the Australian Open, each one after the other. She won four times in a row. After having won her first French Open in 1971, Goolagong stopped competing in the tournament after 1973. She returned in 1983, and this was the last Gland Slam singles tournament she competed in. She lost to Evert.\nGoolagong won six women's doubles titles. She won five at the Australian Open (in 1971, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977), and one at Wimbledon (1974). She also won the mixed doubles title at the French Open in 1972.\nGoolagong was ranked number one in the world for two weeks in 1976. However, it was not reported at the time because incomplete data were used to calculate the rankings. This was discovered in December 2007, 31 years later. She was the 16th woman to hold the top position.\nAwards and recognition.\nGoolagong was awarded Australian of the Year in 1971. She was made an Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1972, and an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1982. She was entered into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. She was made a part of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1988.\nThe National Museum of Australia holds a collection of items to remember Goolagong's career. This includes her 1971 and 1980 Wimbledon singles trophies, the trophy from her 1974 doubles win, and two racquets used in these tournaments.\nPersonal life.\nGoolagong married British tennis player Roger Cawley on 19 June 1975. After their wedding, the couple settled in Naples, Florida. They lived in the U.S. for eight years. They now live in Noosa Heads, in Queensland. They have two children: Kelly and Morgan.\nCareer statistics.\nGoolagong played a total of 869 singles matches. Of these, she won 704 (81.01%). In Grand Slam singles tournaments, she won 82.09% of her matches (133 wins, 29 losses)."}

It survived into the Pliocene, and its remains have been found in Chile, china, France, Germany, Austria, Kansas, Tennessee, Pakistan, Kenya and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\"Gomphotherium\" stood around high with an estimated weight of 4-5 tons, and looked similar to a modern elephant. However, it had four tusks; two on the upper jaw and two on the long lower jaw. \"Gomphotherium\" lived in dry wooded regions near lakes.\nFeeding method.\nThe lower tusks are parallel and shaped like a shovel. They may have been used to dig up food from mud. These animals probably lived in swamps or near lakes, using their tusks to dig or scrape up aquatic vegetation. \nHowever, wear patterns on the teeth of its relative \"Platybelodon\" suggest that it used its lower tusks to strip bark from trees, and may have used the sharp incisors that formed the edge of the \"shovel\" more like a modern-day scythe, grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree.\nUnlike modern elephants, the upper tusks were covered by a layer of enamel. Compared to elephants, the skull was more elongated and low, indicating that the animal had a short trunk, rather like a tapir's. In comparison to earlier proboscids, \"Gomphotherium\" had fewer molars; the remaining ones had high ridges to expand their grinding surface."}

This was given as the reason for Israel attacking Lebanon in 1982.\nLater life.\nArgov recovered from his coma and was returned to Israel. There, he was placed in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem as a permanent patient. Though he could not move, he could clearly understand what was going on around him.\nDeath.\nArgov died at Hadassah Hospital in 2003 aged 73 from the injuries in the attack.

The president leads the executive branch of the Government of Kenya. The president is the commander-in-chief of the Kenya Defence Forces. The first president of Kenya was Jomo Kenyatta. His son, Uhuru is now president.\nRole.\nUnder the 1964 Constitutional Amendment establishing the Republic of Kenya, the President replaced the Monarch as head of state and the Prime Minister as chief executive. The President was initially elected by the House of Representatives of Kenya, and, after the merger of the House of Representatives and Senate into a unicameral National Assembly, by the National Assembly, for a five-year term. In the event of a vacancy the Vice-President would have served as Acting President for 90 days until new elections were held.\nFollowing the enactment of the 1969 Constitution of Kenya, the system of election by the National Assembly was replaced by direct elections under a first-past-the-post system, yet true separation of powers was still not established; The President had to also be elected as an MP and he had to appoint his Ministers from among MPs, the President was still able to dissolve the National Assembly, and the Assembly was still able to declare no confidence in the ministers. Not only that, but until the first multiparty elections in 1992, only one candidate - that of the Kenya African National Union - was nominated and automatically declared winner of the elections without voting actually being held.\nWith the enactment of the 2010 Constitution, Kenya's current, the first-past-the-post system was replaced in presidential elections in favor of a two-round system, the post of Vice-President was renamed Deputy President and was made to automatically succeed to the Presidency in case of a vacancy for the remainder of the term in a full, not merely acting, capacity, and the requirement of the President, DP, and ministers to also be MPs was abolished, finally establishing separation of powers between the executive and legislature."}

They were convicted of killing two men during an armed robbery in Braintree, Massachusetts.\nSacco and Vanzetti were immigrants to the country. Both were anarchists who supported rebellion against governments that were violent and oppressive.\nThey were put on trial in 1921. They were convicted even though evidence was clear that they had not committed the crime. This evidence involved ballistics tests and several witnesses who claimed Sacco had been in Boston and Vanzetti in Plymouth on the day of the robbery. The two men were carrying weapons when they were arrested. To explain this, Sacco and Vanzetti had to explain their anarchist beliefs in court. It is believed that this may have prejudiced the jury (influenced their decision).\nThe jury found Sacco and Vanzetti guilty of murder on 14 July 1921. The case drew attention from around the world. As details of the trial became public, many protests were held against their conviction. Sacco and Vanzetti were eventually executed on 23 August 1927. Since their deaths, scholars have mostly agreed that Sacco and Vanzetti were wrongfully convicted. They also did not speak English so they could not get a defense attorney themselves. This would not have mattered because they could not afford an attorney anyway."}

By 1929 he had eliminated several of his rival crime bosses. The last one on his \"list\" was Bugs Moran. Capone was trying to appear as if he was retired to Florida. So Capone didn't want to be seen as starting another gang war. Instead, Capone gave the order to one of his associates, Jack McGurn, to eliminate Bugs Moran. \nThe massacre.\nOn the morning of 14 February, McGurn lured Moran and his men to a warehouse on Clark street. The bait was a stolen of whisky they could buy cheap. Seven of Moran's men were there to inspect the load. A police car pulled up outside the building and several of Capone's men dressed in Chicago police uniforms went in and pretended to arrest Moran's men. When they were lined up against a wall when the killers pulled out Thompson submachine guns and opened fire. Six of the seven men were killed. Moran himself was just arriving when he saw the police car and escaped without notice.\nAt this time murder was not a federal offense. Most of the killers McGurn hired were from out of town. Police departments from different cities rarely could work together to solve crimes at that time. So the killers knew if they simply left Chicago after the massacre nobody could touch them.\nResults.\nNewspapers ran stories of the gangster shootings and prohibition in Chicago. These were complete with detailed photographs of the murders. At first many thought the Chicago police had committed the massacre. But most people in Chicago thought Al Capone was behind the murders. Capone had an . He was at his winter home in Palm Beach, Florida when the murders took place. The suspicions finally resulted in the arrests of Vincenzio Damora and John Scalise. These were two of Capone's known . Scalise was charged with the murders after Damora came up with an alibi. But Capone murdered Scalise personally before he could stand trial. also put pressure on the FBI to arrest Capone with any charge they could. In 1931 they finally charged him with tax evasion and sent him to prison. Capone was sent to Alcatraz for eleven years. When he was finally released he was too sick to continue his crime career. He died in 1947. Prohibition was repealed in 1933 which all but eliminated bootlegging."}

They are about 800,000 years to a million years old. They were found on Happisburgh beach, East Anglia in May 2013.\nThe archaeologists describe them as \"the oldest known hominin footprint surface outside Africa at between ca. 1 million and 0.78 million years ago\". The site is known for its preservation of sediments with early Pleistocene fauna and flora. Since 2005 flint tools have been found. This means humans occupied northern Europe at least 350,000 years earlier than was thought before.\nThe footprints were found in sediment, partially covered by beach sand, at low tide on the shore at Happisburgh. Stormy weather had washed away the sand, leaving the sediment exposed. Because the sediment was soft, and lay below the high tide mark, the tides quickly eroded the exposed sediment, and in two weeks the footprints had all been destroyed. The team worked during low tides, often in pouring rain, to record 3D images of all the footprints.\nArchaeology.\nIn 2010, Simon Parfitt and colleagues from University College London discovered flint tools near Happisburgh. The tools were dated to \"somewhere between 866,000 to 814,000 years ago or 970,000 to 936,000 years ago\", around 100,000 years earlier than the finds at Pakefield. The flints were probably left by hunter-gatherers of the human species \"Homo antecessor\" who inhabited the flood plains and marshlands that bordered an ancient course of the river Thames. The flints were then washed downriver and came to rest at the Happisburgh site. In May 2013 the oldest human footprints outside of Africa, being more than 800,000 years old, were reported to have been discovered on the beach."}

It is usually done to evade taxation or prohibition laws.\n\"Rum-running\" usually means smuggling over water. The term is thought to come from the start of the Prohibition era in the United States. This is when ships from Bimini in the western Bahamas transported cheap rum to Florida to be sold illegally. But there was little profit in cheap rum. They soon started smuggling Canadian whisky, French champagne, and English gin to major cities like New York City and Boston. This gave them a high profit. It was said that some ships carried $200,000 worth of alcohol in a single trip.\n\"Bootlegging\" usually means smuggling over land. It is thought the term \"bootlegging\" started during the American Civil War. Soldiers would sneak liquor into army camps by hiding bottles of liquor in their boots or under their trouser legs."}

Blackheath has one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London.\nHistory.\nThe name is recorded in 1166 as \"Blachehedfeld\" and means the \"dark coloured heathland\". It is formed from the Old English 'bl\u00e6c' and 'h\u01e3th' and refers to the open space that was the meeting place of the ancient hundred of Blackheath. The name was later used for the Victorian suburb that developed in the 19th century and was extended to the areas known as Blackheath Park and Blackheath Vale.\nOrigins.\nThe Roman road that later became known as Watling Street crosses the northern edge of Blackheath (almost in line with the A2).\nBlackheath was a rallying point for Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt of 1381, and for Jack Cade's Kentish rebellion in 1450. Wat Tyler is remembered by Wat Tyler Road on the heath. After pitching camp on Blackheath, Cornish rebels were defeated in the Battle of Deptford Bridge (sometimes called the Battle of Blackheath), just to the west, on 17 June 1497.\nWith Watling Street carrying stagecoaches across the heath, on the way to north Kent and the Channel ports, it was also a common place for highwaymen to rob travelers during the 17th and 18th centuries.\nBlackheath Park.\nThe sizeable estate of Blackheath Park was created on lands of Wricklemarsh Manor, and built over in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It has fine examples of substantial Georgian and Victorian houses \u2013 most notably Michael Searles' crescent of semi-detached terrace houses linked by colonnades, The Paragon (c 1793-1807). \nThe Pagoda is a good example of a beautiful property in Blackheath, built in 1760 by Sir William Chambers. It was later leased to the Prince Regent, who later became King George IV, and used as a summer home by his wife Caroline, Princess of Wales.\nSports.\nIn 1608, according to tradition, Blackheath was the place where golf was introduced to England \u2013 the Royal Blackheath Golf Club. The club was one of the first golf associations established (1766) outside Scotland. Since 1923 it has been in nearby Eltham. Blackheath also gave its name to the first hockey club, established during the mid 19th century.\nThe Blackheath Rugby Club was founded in 1858, the oldest rugby club in England. The Blackheath club organised the world's first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871), and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later. Blackheath Rugby Club was one of the 12 founding members of the Football Association in 1863."}

On August 12, 1985, the Boeing 747-146SR developed mechanical problems 12 minutes after taking off. The plane then crashed into Mount Takamagahara in Gunma Prefecture 32 minutes later, after the pilots tried to control the plane, but failed. 520 people died, and only 4 survived. The crash was caused by incorrect repair after a tailstrike incident, which caused metal fatigue and eventually an in-flight structural failure, in which the whole tail of the plane separated from the plane.\nThe crash was the worst plane crash involving only one plane by number of fatalities.\nAirplane involved.\nThe plane that crashed was a Boeing 747-146SR (SR stands for short range), with tail number JA8119. The plane was used to fly short, domestic routes within Japan. The plane first flew on January 28, 1974. It had 4 Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A engines. Before it crashed, it had flown for 25030 hours, and took off and landed 18835 times.\nOn June 2, 1978, JA8119 was involved in a tailstrike accident at Osaka International Airport. When landing, the plane's tail struck the runway. The aft pressure bulkhead was damaged in the accident, as well as the rear of the plane. Later, during June 17 and July 11, repairman from Boeing repaired the plane, by replacing the lower part of the rear and a part of the bulkhead. The plane later returned to service.\nWhile investigating the accident, the investigators realised that the repair done 7 years before the accident by Boeing was incorrect. While two rows of rivets were required for a splice plate in the bulkhead to be installed, the repairman only used one row. This increased the chance of metal fatigue by 70% and also caused the subsequent accident.\nPassengers and crew.\nOn that day, the plane was flown by three crew. The 49-year-old captain, Masami Takahama, was a very experienced pilot. He has flown for 12423 hours, with 4842 hours on 747s. The 39-year-old co-pilot, Yutaka Sasaki, was training to be a captain. On that flight, he was seated on the left-seat (which is usually for captains). He has flown 3963 hours, with 2665 hours on 747s. The last crew, 46-years-old flight engineer, Hiroshi Fukuda, has flown 9831 hours, with 3846 hours on 747s. There were also 12 cabin crew.\nThe countries which the passengers and crew came from are listed below.\nAccident.\nOn the afternoon of the accident day, JA8119 has already completed two round trip flights, JL503/504 to and from Sapporo, and JL363/366 to and from Fukuoka. At 5.17pm, the plane has just completed flight JL366, and was parked at Spot 18 at Tokyo International Airport, getting ready for its flight to Osaka, JL123. \nAt 6.04pm, the plane started taxiing towards the runway. Takeoff was at 6.12pm, and the plane climbed to its cruising height of 24000ft (about 7300 metres). Till then, everything was fine.\nAt 6.24pm, there was suddenly a loud noise heard, which was actually caused by the pressure bulkhead's failure. This caused an explosive decompression. Air rushed out of the plane and blew off the tail of the plane. As all four hydraulic lines, which control the plane, are located in the tail, the plane became uncontrollable. 46 seconds later the pilots squawked 7700 (meaning that they are in an emergency) and requested to return to Tokyo International Airport. However, although the air traffic controller approved the plane to turn towards Tokyo, the plane strangely started heading towards the north-west direction. At 6.28pm, the Tokyo Air Traffic Controller asked the pilots to turn left, but received the message from the pilots, \"now uncontrollable.\" By then, the plane was moving in a way called the phugoid motion, climbing until losing speed and stalling, then the nose goes down and gaining speed until the plane is able to climb again. The phugoid motion repeated itself until the end of the flight.\nAt 6.31pm, the air traffic controller asked the plane if it can land at Nagoya Airport, which was 72 miles (about 133 km) from the plane. However, the pilots wanted to return to Tokyo. Between 6.35pm and 6.56pm, the pilots struggled to control the plane without the tail. This failed, as the plane flew uncontrollably towards the mountains.\nAt 6.56pm, the plane's right wing hit a ridge. The plane then flew on, crashed into a second ridge, and exploded. 520 people died, while 4 people survived.\nThe time taken for the plane to crash after the bulkhead failure is 32 minutes. The accident was the worst in aviation history involving explosive decompression."}
{"id": "438066", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438066", "title": "Oncogene", "text": "An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. Or, equally good, an oncogene is a gene which brings about uncontrolled cell division.\nOncogenes in tumor cells are often mutated or expressed at high levels.\nMost normal cells undergo a programmed form of death (apoptosis). Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead. Most oncogenes require an additional step, such as mutations in another gene, or environmental factors, such as viral infection, to cause cancer. Since the 1970s, dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer. Many cancer drugs target the proteins coded by oncogenes.\nIn 1976 J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus of the University of California, San Francisco showed that oncogenes were activated proto-oncogenes, found in many organisms including humans. For this discovery Bishop and Varmus were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1989.\nThe history of a mistake.\nThe work of Bishop and Varmus corrected a long-standing error. The Nobel citation includes this explanation:\nIn fact, the reverse transcription of the virus RNA into DNA had the effect that the oncogenes become integrated into the chromosomal DNA in the cells. It was then found that oncogene-like material could be detected in different species throughout the animal kingdom, in fact even in simple organisms with only a few cells. Furthermore, it was shown that the gene had a fixed position in the chromosomes of a certain species, and that the gene, when it constituted part of the cellular genetic material, was divided into fragments.\nProto-oncogene.\nA proto-oncogene is a normal gene that can become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. The resultant protein can be called an oncoprotein. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon \"activation\", a proto-oncogene (or its product) becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene.\nExamples.\nThe MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's Lymphoma. This starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence close to the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the 'Philadelphia Chromosome'. This is a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is active, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation."}

{"id": "438179", "revid": "691370", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438179", "title": "Navajo people", "text": "The Navajo people (Navajo: Din\u00e9 or Naabeeh\u00f3) are a tribe of Native Americans from the southwestern part of the United States. The Navajo tribe has about 300,000 members. The capital is in Window Rock, Arizona. It is the second largest tribe in the United States. The Navajo Nation is an independent government that runs a large Native American reservation in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Many Navajo live there, but not all of them. Most Navajo speak English. Some speak the Navajo language. The Navajo have many things in common with the Apache tribe and the two groups may share a common ancestry.\nGovernment.\nThe Navajo Nation works to maintain an economy for a population of 250,000 plus members. The discovery of oil on Navajo lands in the 1920s started the tribe towards building a systematic form of government. A tribal government was established in 1923 to deal with oil exploration. The Navajo Nation is currently the largest and most sophisticated form of Native American government. The Navajo Nation has become a wealthy nation in its own right.\nLanguage.\nThe Navajo language is called Din\u00e9. It is a tonal language, meaning that a word may mean something different if said with a different pitch. About 150,000 people speak Din\u00e9. Din\u00e9 is very difficult to learn because the speaker has to understand the relationships between different things.\nCulture.\nMuch of the Navajo culture, religion and other beliefs say everything in the world is connected and everything has a spirit.\nThe Navajo culture involves many different ceremonies. Some are short. The longest can take nine days. There are ceremonies to make sick people well and solve other problems. When a Navajo person becomes sick, he or she might go to a modern doctor or hospital, might pay a medicine man to sing a healing ceremony, or might do both.\nMany Navajo people are more comfortable with not talking than most Americans and would rather just touch hands than do a full handshake. In a Navajo conversation, it is all right to take a long time to answer a question and it is important not to interrupt the other person. Some Navajo do not like to make eye contact.\nNavajo culture has clans. Sons and daughters are in the same clan their mother is in. When meeting a new person, a Navajo will usually say their own clan and their father's clan. Navajo culture does not allow people to marry other people from the same clan. Navajo people usually think of anyone from the same clan as a brother, sister or cousin. Originally, there were four Navajo clans, but there are more now.\nThe number four is in many parts of Navajo culture: Four seasons, four clans at first, four directions, and four holy mountains.\nMost Navajo wear modern American clothing most of the time but put on traditional clothes for special occasions. For women, traditional clothes are a \"tl'aakal\" skirt with a long-sleeve \"deiji'\u00e9\u00e9\"' shirt and shawl with moccasins. For men, traditional clothes are a white pants and silver or turquoise \"dootl\u2019izhii\" jewelry with a headband and shirt, and moccasins. Both men and women tie their hair into a bun on the back of the head.\nThe Navajo Nation Fair is in Window Rock, Arizona every year in September. It is the largest Native American fair in the United States. It has a rodeo, a parade, Navajo music and dance contests and the Miss Navajo Nation beauty pageant.\nNewspaper.\nIn 1959, the Navajo Tribal Council started a newsletter. It grew into the \"Navajo Times\" newspaper. In the 21st century alone, the \"Navajo Times\" has won awards from the Arizona Press Club, Arizona Newspaper Association, and Native American Journalists Association. This included awards for writing, its website and photography.\nLivestock.\nThe Navajo got sheep and goats after the Spanish brought them to North America. This might be why their culture changed from Apache culture. They became very good at raising sheep and goats and making cloth from sheep's wool. In Navajo culture, the official owner of the sheep was usually a woman and not a man. The Navajo also had horses and cows.\nDuring the Great Depression, the United States government saw that Navajo and Hopi land was overgrazed and decided to \"reduce\" the number of sheep and goats. They did not ask the Navajo what they thought. They took sheep and goats away from the Navajo. Some of the animals were sold, but for less than half what they were worth. Some of the animals were killed and their meat processed and returned to the owners. Some of the animals were set on fire in front of their owners.\nIn his book about his own life, \"Code Talker\", Chester Nez wrote that the Great Livestock Massacre hurt the work ethic of the Navajo people because it meant no matter how hard you worked to build your family's herd, the government could take it away.\nHistory.\nAccording to Navajo traditional beliefs, the Navajo came into the world, which they call \"the glittering world,\" after passing through three other worlds. According to historians and anthropologists, the Navajo were not the first humans to live in the Four Corners area, but they were already there in 1492. The Spanish made contact with the Navajo in 1581.\nLike many other Native American tribes, the Navajo suffered after white colonists came to the area. After the Spanish-American War in the 1840s, the United States took over the land where the Navajo lived. Many Navajo died during the Long Walk, or Hw\u00e9\u200beldi Baa Hane', in 1864. The Long Walk was when the United States government made many Navajo leave their homes and go to Bosque Redondo Reservation. It was not a real reservation; it was a camp with soldiers to keep people from leaving. Although they were allowed to go back years later, many died during the journey and during their time away.\nThe Navajo Nation government, called the Navajo Tribal Council, was established in 1923. One of the reasons for this was that oil had been discovered on Navajo land. The first election was in 1938. In 1989, the government was changed to have three branches, judicial, legislative, and executive. It is now the largest Native American government in the world.\nDuring the 20th century, many Navajo families lost much of their wealth in the Great Livestock Massacre.\nCode talkers.\nNavajo code talkers were bilingual Navajo speakers who were recruited during World War II by the U.S. Marines. They served in their standard communications units in the Pacific Theater. The Navajo code was created by the first 29 Navajo recruits in May of 1942. About 400 Navajos were trained as code talkers. Their training was intense and all 17 pages of the code had to be memorized. From 1942 to 1945 Navajo Code Talkers took part in every Marine assault in the Pacific Theatre. Navajos served in all six Marine divisions plus parachute units and the Marine Raider battalions. The Navajo Code worked much faster than Morse Code, minutes instead of hours. They transmitted messages on the battlefield including orders, troop movements and logistics. While the Japanese were able to break codes used by the United States Army and the United States Army Air Corps, they were never able to break the Marine codes. Even a Navajo soldier captured during the Battle of Bataan could not figure out the code for the Japanese. Major Howard Connor, a 5th Marine Division signal officer at Iwo Jima stated: \"Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.\"\nThe United States Military used the Navajo code in the Korean War and in the beginning of the Vietnam War, so they kept the code a secret. During the late 1960s, the United States stopped using the code, and declassified it in 1968, meaning it was no longer a secret. The code talkers were then allowed to talk about what they had done.\nOn September 17, 1992, the Navajo code talkers of World War II were honored for their contributions at the Pentagon in Washington, DC. The long delay was due to the Navajo code being Classified information."}

The electrical signal cannot pass the gap between neurons alone. This is why neurotransmitters are needed to pass signals from one neuron to the next. In this sense they differ from electrical synapses which pass electric signals directly to the next neuron.

It is about 10 billion light-years away in the constellations of Hercules and Corona Borealis, hence its name.\nIt was discovered in November 2013 by mapping gamma-ray bursts. They are very luminous explosions of distant, massive stars, the most powerful explosions in the universe. A typical burst releases more energy in less than a tenth of a second than the Sun will in its whole life of 10 billion years. \nGamma-ray bursts are very rare: only one happens in a typical galaxy every few million years. The stars which cause these explosions are very massive, so the material required for them to be formed must be in great amounts. So, these explosions can be used to track down if there is a galaxy in that direction, or there is a large group of matter in there.\nBetween the years of 1997 to 2012, astronomers mapped these bursts in the sky, with the help of the robotic satellites Swift and Fermi which looks for gamma-ray bursts and measures their redshifts. In the map they produced, they noticed something interesting; 14 gamma-ray bursts have very similar redshifts and are very close to each other. This means that there is a very large group of galaxies and matter in the region. They say, from measuring these bursts, comes up with a very large structure measuring 10 billion light-years in diameter.\nFor comparison, the Milky Way, the galaxy we live in, measures only 200,000 light-years, and the distance from the Milky Way to the Andromeda Galaxy measures only 2.5 million light-years. The Huge-LQG (the Huge Large Quasar Group), the previous largest structure in the universe, is 4 billion light-years long.\nThe discovery of the Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall contradicts a theory proposed by Albert Einstein known as the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle says that the entire universe is approximately equal; any two regions in the universe will look very similar, even if those two regions are very far apart, assuming those regions have sizes larger than 250 to 300 million light-years. Maximum sizes of structures must be around 1.2 billion light-years based on the meaning above, and no structure must be larger than that, assuming that matter is spreaded equally from the Big Bang. However, the structure, is eight times larger than the limit, contradicting the cosmological principle.\nThe structure also contradicts theories about the evolution of the universe. The structure is 10 billion light-years away, which means that we see the structure 10 billion years ago, when the universe is only 13.8 billion years old, and its light was just approaching us. The 3.8 billion year span of time is \"too short for a giant structure 10 billion light-years long to form\". Even Istvan Horvath, the discoverer of the structure, says he has no idea how the structure has formed in that amount of time. For now, the existence of the structure is still a mystery for cosmologists.\nAnother idea says that the idea of the Big Bang might be proven false as a result of this incredible cosmic structure."}

Different art schools laid down rules on what a good painting or artwork shouls look like. Academic art was influenced by these rules, and was about applying them when creating a work of art. Academic art is a form of Realism in art. One of the main ideas that influenced academic art was that of Aristotle: A work of art should give a selective, but true copy of a part of reality. This idea was transformed into the concept of mimesis, or imitation. Together with thisidea, there were a number of subjects that were acceptable for painting or sculpture. Very often, the subjects came from mythology\nThe \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris had a lot of influence on the movement. At the time Neoclassicism and Romanticism were the main movements at the school. \nWith later art styles, especially that of impressionism, academic art losts its importance.\nWell known artists who painted in the academic art style include William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, Eugene de Blaas, Edward Poynter, Wilhelm Bendz and Alexander Ivanov."}

His parents are Americans. His father has African-American, Jamaican, English, German, Jewish, and Cherokee background, and his mother is of Russian, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.\nIn 2007, Miller denied to \"InStyle\" that he was gay. He later came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website. In the letter he turned down the offer to go to the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival. The reason was because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens.

An AMOLED display uses an active matrix of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) that emits light when an electrical signal is present.\nAs of 2008, AMOLED technology was used in phones, media players, and digital cameras. They are starting to be used more in low-power, cheaper and large-sized applications as well.\nAdvantages.\nOLEDs work just like a regular LED except the diodes in OLEDs are thinner. Other type of displays, such as LCDs, require an external light source (backlighting) to illuminate the screen whereas OLED displays do not. Energy efficiency is also an advantage of AMOLED displays. It is more energy efficient than LED and other types of displays. This is because AMOLED displays generate less heat while emitting light, allowing for less energy being lost during heat transfer. It is energy efficient in its ability to consume less power as well. It can be utilized well for portable consumer electronic devices, where good battery-life is essential. Because of this efficiency, AMOLED displays can also be considered eco-friendly. Compared to other types of displays, AMOLED displays can produce high refresh rates although LCD leads in that specific area. AMOLED displays also allow to be folded, which manufacturers use to make bezel-less screens that fold behind the display.\nDisadvantages.\nAMOLED displays are prone to screen burn-ins, which leaves a permanent imprint of overused colors from overused images. The imprint only happens if the screen is used at maximum brightness for a long time. Because of the organic compounds of its technology too, unlike light diodes or inorganic crystalline, AMOLED displays are highly susceptible to water damage. Putting the display in water would result in immediate colour and pixel damage. Thus, sealing techniques must be taken into consideration during the manufacturing process. \u00a0\nBecause of AMOLED\u2019s reduced maximum brightness and lack of backlighting, AMOLED displays may be difficult to view in direct sunlight compared to LCDs.[13][\"citation needed\"]. However, there are solutions to this problem. Samsung, for example, fixes this problem by reducing the size of gaps between layers of the screen. 14][15] \u00a0\nMarketing.\nAMOLED Screens have been marketed in various ways by different companies. Apple refers their AMOLED displays as \u201cSuper Retina HD\u201d while Samsung refers to theirs as \u201cSuper AMOLED\u201d. Motorola, HTC, Google and all the other device makers market in different ways even though most of their screens are created by Samsung, which controls 98% of the AMOLED display market. \nFuture Development.\nManufacturers have tried to address the disadvantages of AMOLED display technology. Samsung has announced their launch of the world\u2019s first stretchable touchscreen display with a 9:1 inch dynamic stretchable AMOLED display. The new screen is based off of LTPS (Low Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon) technology, which helps with deforming necessary pixels for stretching. \u00a0AU Optronics, an electronics manufacturer in Taiwan, has also made moves to develop in-cell touch panels into AMOLED display\u2019s fabrication process.

This has lasted from the 1970s to the present. It was caused by a great increase in dinosaur discoveries, and by new ideas of how they lived. \nThe \"renaissance\", a word which means \"rebirth\", changed how dinosaurs pictured both by professional illustrators, and in the public eye. \nJohn Ostrom's 1964 discovery of \"Deinonychus\" is one of the most important fossil finds. \"Deinonychus\" was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its \"terrible claw\". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. One conclusion was that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and so in some cases were warm-blooded. This was popularized by Ostrom's student Robert Bakker. The impression of dinosaurs as being slow, cold-blooded, small-brained reptiles needed to be rethought, at least for some of the carnivores.\nMain issues.\nThese are the main points:\nChinese lagerst\u00e4tten.\nThe discovery of new feathered dinosaurs in China has kept the field in the forefront of research and populat attention.

It is a branch of the House of Aviz. The House changed from being powerful dukes of Portuguese nobility, to ruling as the monarchs of Portugal and the Algarves, from 1640 to 1910. They were also monarchs of Brazil, from 1815 to 1889. The heir to the Portuguese throne was usually given the title of \"Duke of Braganza\".\nHistory.\nThe House of Braganza was founded in 1442. This is when Afonso, 8th Count of Barcelos, was made Duke of Braganza. Alfonso (Alfonso I) was an illegitimate son of King Jo\u00e3o I of Portugal, of the House of Aviz. He was made a duke by his nephew, King Afonso V of Portugal. The feudal dukes quickly collected a fortune in properties, titles, and power. By the mid 1600s, the House was the most powerful in all of Portugal. It was also of the greatest houses of Iberia.\nThe House of Braganza became the reigning house of Brazil, first, when the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves was created in 1815. The United Kingdom lasted until 1822, when the Brazilian Empire became independent from Portugal. The new Brazilian nation was led by Prince Pedro of Braganza, heir to the Portuguese throne, who ruled as Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, as well as King Pedro IV of Portugal. Until 1835, the Portuguese Braganzas were still in the line of succession to the Brazilian throne. The House was deposed (removed) from the Brazilian throne, in 1889, when Brazil was proclaimed a republic.\nThe House continued to be the house to the Brazilian throne until 1921. This is when Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, daughter of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, died. Her claim passed to her son, Prince Pedro Henrique of Orl\u00e9ans and Braganza. Thus the House of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza became the claimant house to the former monarchy of Brazil. Pedro Henrique died in 1981. The current claimant is his eldest son, Prince Luiz.\nIn Portugal, King Carlos I of Portugal was assassinated in 1908. Also killed in the attack was his eldest son. His younger son, Manuel II, became king. When the Portuguese Republic was established, in 1910, King Manuel II and the rest of the Braganzas went into exile."}

It guarantees the protection of children from child trafficking. It also guarantees them safe adoption and a quick adoption process.\nHistory.\nIn May 1993 the proposal was presented at the seventeenth session of The Hague Convention. It became effective in 1995. The United States ratified the Hague Adoption Convention in December 2007. Forty-six countries had ratified the treaty as of May 2002. Thirteen more had yet to ratify it. Many countries which have not ratified the Convention do not permit foreign adoptions of their children nor adoptions of foreign children. For example, Muslim countries do not permit foreign adoptions.\nConcerns.\nAdopting children from one country into a family from another is a relatively new idea. It developed after World War II. By the 1970s it became a fairly common event. But it was soon recognized this was creating a number of legal and human problems. There were few domestic and international laws that adequately protected children's rights. The Hague Adoption Convention of 1993 addressed these concerns. The Convention gave the responsibility of providing the protection against child trafficking, safe adoption and a quick adoption process to the countries and to adoption agencies.\nThe convention also raised several ethical concerns. In a normal domestic adoption the child loses connections and identification with their biological family. In an international adoption a child may also lose identification with their nationality and ethnicity. Adoptions that span countries should be considered only after all efforts to place adopted children within their own country. UNICEF, by comparison, does not encourage international adoptions. They encourage nations to adopt within their own country.\nThe Future for international adoptions.\nThere has been a sharp decline in international adoptions in the last few years. Romania, for one, has ended all foreign adoptions. Belarus and the Ukraine closed foreign adoptions for 2007. The 5000 adoptions from China in 2005 dropped to 4000 in 2006. Wars and natural disasters were the reasons for massive adoptions from the affected countries in the past. But the international community is no longer in favor of this as a solution. Adoptions from Africa are increasing, however. The number of Orphans from Liberia and Ethiopia have increased from 2006\u20132008. But the costs to adopt a child from another country have risen. This is due in part to the steps taken by the convention to prevent abuse of the system."}

In 1919 two states, Michigan and Montana, passed equal pay laws. But it wasn't until after World War II that any other states followed their examples. The United States Women's Bureau, a part of the United States Department of Labor, was established in 1920. Since their start they have pushed for equal pay. In 1952 the National Committee for Equal Pay was established as a coalition of several woman's, labor, business, and civic group|groups. They began a campaign for new laws requiring equal pay. In 1945 the 79th Congress introduced an equal pay bill that did not pass. It was 18 years later when the 88th Congress passed such legislation. It was called the Equal Pay Act of 1963.\nAs an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 made it against Federal law to discriminate against workers on the basis of gender. This is when \"tasks require equal skill, effort, and responsibility under similar working conditions.\" President John F. Kennedy signed this into law on June, 10 1963. At the ceremony held in the Oval Office of the White House president Kennedy gave special recognition to several groups and individuals who worked towards this law. Among those honored were Congresswomen Edna Kelly and Edith Green, Assistant Secretary of Labor Esther Peterson, National Council of Negro Women President Dr. Dorothy Height and Business and Professional Women's Foundation President Dr. Minnie Miles.\nThe act passed largely due to Congress recognizing the changing in the United States. Male-supported households were becoming obsolete as more women entered the workforce. Higher divorce rates meant more female-supported households. But in the 1960s women earned only 60 cents for every dollar paid to male workers. The Equal Pay Act was intended as part of the solution to unequal pay. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, added more to the Equal Pay Act by making it unlawful to discriminate based on race \"or\" sex. Title VII also added White-collar worker to the Act.\nResults.\nBy the 1970s women were earning 75 cents per male-earned dollar. According to US Department of Labor statistics, in 2007 the rate was still at about 75 cents. The gap between college educated women and college educated men has actually widened slightly. In Fortune 500 companies (top US corporations) women still hold only about 17% of top positions. As of 2010 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that women who worked earned about 81 cents for every (full-time) male-earned dollar."}

Arizona, , was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court. The Court ruled that a suspect in police custody must be informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning. They must be informed of the right against self-incrimination. They must also make certain the suspect understands these rights.\nThe Miranda warning (often abbreviated to \"Miranda,\" or \"Mirandizing\" a suspect) is the name of the formal warning that is required to be given by police in the United States to criminal suspects. It must be given before they are interrogated, in accordance with the \"Miranda\" ruling. Its purpose is to ensure the accused are aware of these rights under the U.S. Constitution. Also so they know they know they can invoke them at any time during the interview.\nNamesake.\nOn 13 March 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested by police officers in Phoenix, Arizona. Miranda asked why he was being arrested but was given no answer. At the time of his arrest he was not charged with any crime. Ten days earlier an 18-year old girl claimed she had been sexually assaulted. When she talked to the police, her story changed several times. A few days later she was leaving work and saw a suspicious car she thought might be the same as the one used in her assault. A partial license plate led police to arrest and question Miranda. In a lineup, the girl could not identify her attacker but thought he looked similar to Miranda. During the interview with Miranda, police told the suspect he failed the lineup. After hours of interrogation Miranda finally signed a confession. Police also got Miranda to confess to two other cases of abduction and robbery which \"cleared\" two more cases.\nMiranda v Arizona.\nThe case of Ernesto Miranda and three other similar cases were heard before the Supreme Court. All four defendants did not have attorneys present when they were questioned. The decision was announced on 13 June 1966 by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Because of the important changes it made, he read the entire sixty pages. Four justices disagreed with the ruling. Their argument was that all the defendants confessed. Their opinion was that allowing lawyers in interrogations would prevent most suspects from confessing.\nAs a result Ernesto Miranda's first conviction was overturned but he faced a second trial on sexual assault and kidnapping charges in 1967. His confession could not be used against him but the prosecutor got Miranda's girlfriend to testify he told her he did it. She said it happened three days after his police confession. He was found guilty and got the same sentence again.\nTypical Miranda warning.\nThere are some 17,000 police departments in the United States. They use any of hundreds of different versions of the Miranda warning. These range from a few words to over 400. One reason is that many fall into vulnerable groups who do not always understand written or oral Miranda warnings. These include those who are deaf, do not speak or read English well, juveniles, mentally ill, and or the mentally challenged. The courts have been less than protective of the rights of these groups who may not have understood their Miranda rights.\nOther countries.\nLike the Miranda warnings, other countries have written rights they give to suspects before police begin their questioning. They have procedures to insure a confession is valid in their court systems. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for example, provides that if someone is arrested they have certain rights. These are to be promptly told why they were arrested, told they have a right to retain legal council and the right of proof of habeas corpus (or be released from custody). "}

It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies.\nThe disease has three forms:\nLeishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than 20 species of \"Leishmania\". Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by identifying the parasites under a microscope. The visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test.\nLeishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies. Early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of \"Leishmania\" and the type of infection. Medications used for the visceral form include: liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For the cutaneous form, paromomycin, fluconazole or pentamidine can help.\nAs of 2014, about 12 million people are infected in some 98 countries. There are about 2 million new cases each year. Each year, between 20 thousand and 50 thousand people die from the disease. About 200\u00a0million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has gotten discounts on some medications to treat the disease.\nThe parasites that cause the disease also infect other mammals: The disease has been described in dogs, cats, rodents, cattle and horses. In addition to the mammal, the parasite needs an insect that spreads the parasite through its sting. \nLifecycle of the parasite.\nLeishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies. These can transmit the infection \"Leishmania\". The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals (1). Metacyclic promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages (2) and transform into amastigotes (3). Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on which \"Leishmania\" species is involved (4). The differences in the type of tissue affected are responsible for the different visible types of leishmaniasis. Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes (5,6). In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes (7), which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis (8).\nThe genomes of three \"Leishmania\" species have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite. \"Leishmania\" has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for drugs and aid the development of vaccines."}

Parasitic diseases spread by the flies include leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and pappataci fever. In the New World leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus \"Lutzomyia\". \"Lutzomyia\" often live in caves, where their main hosts are bats. In the Old World sand flies in the genus \"Phlebotomus\" spread leishmaniasis.\nPhlebotomine females, and only females, suck blood from various mammals, reptiles and birds. Some species are selective, whereas others bite any suitable host they find. As far as is known all species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs after the first. Proteins and other nutrients in the blood enable the female to produce eggs. \nThe flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding. They then suck up the exposed blood. Like practically all blood-feeding parasites, they inject biochemicals that inhibit blood clotting, plus some that stimulate host mast cells to produce histamine; this distend capillary vessels, thereby promoting blood flow.\nOne blood meal can support the production of about 100 eggs. Females lay their eggs in humid soil rich in organic matter.\nSand flies are small; a body size of about 3mm in length is typical. This helps them in escape notice. Their bite is not always felt, but leaves a small round, reddish bump that starts itching hours or days later. Use of insect repellent is recommended in areas where sand flies are present."}

Usually riders start the race at the same time. The winner is the first to the finish line at the end of the route.\nRoad bicycle racing is popular in Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. More recently, countries such as Kazakhstan, Australia, Venezuela, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland and the United States have also become very good at racing.\nRoad bicycle racing began as a sport in 1868. The first world championship was in 1893. Cycling has been part of the Olympic Games since 1896.\nAt the beginning the sport was popular in France, Spain, Belgium, and Italy. Some of the first races were Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge (started in 1892), Paris-Roubaix (1896), the Tour de France (1903), the Milan \u2013 San Remo and Giro di Lombardia (1905), the Giro d'Italia (1909) and the Tour of Flanders (1913). Nowadays there are many other races, but these historic races remain the most famous and many cyclists want to win them.\nRoad race types.\nSingle-day races.\nSingle day races are held on one day. The race can be any distance from a few kilometres to over 200km. The race route may go from one place to another, or be a number of laps of a circuit. Some routes take the riders from a starting place and then finish with several laps of a circuit. This helps create excitement for the crowd at the finish.\nTime trial.\nAn individual time trial is an event in which cyclists race alone against the clock. A team time trial is where teams of cyclists race against the clock. In both types of time trial, each cyclist or team starts the race at different times so that each start is fair and equal. The winner is the cyclist or team who finishes the race in the fastest time. Race distances vary from a few km to 60 and rarely more than 100\u00a0km.\nStage races.\nStage races are made up of races held for several days in a row. These races are called stages. The competitor with the lowest total time to finish all the stages is the overall winner. He or she is called the general classification (GC) winner. Stage races often have other awards, such as prizes for each stage winners, the points classification winner, and the \"King of the Mountains\" winner. Some stage races include time trials or team time trials. The stage winner is the first person to cross the finish line that day or the time trial rider (or team) with the lowest time on the course.\nUltramarathons.\nThese races are very long single stage events. They usually last several days. The winner is the first one to cross the finish line. The riders take breaks on their own schedules. One of the best-known ultramarathons is the Race Across America (RAAM). It is a coast-to-coast non-stop, single-stage race. Riders cover approximately 3,000 miles in about a week.\nTeams.\nThe winner of the race is the first rider to cross the finish line. However many riders are grouped together in teams. Teams usually have commercial sponsors and are named after the main sponsor. For example some famous teams have been called T-Mobile, Rabobank, ONCE, and Lampre. There can be up to twelve team members in professional races. Team riders decide which team member has the best chance of winning the race. The choice will depend on how hilly the route is, the chance that everyone will finish together in a sprint, and other things. The rest of the team will work to help him or her win the race.\nIn professional races, radios are used so that the team can talk to each other and the team director. The team director often travels in a team car behind the race to monitor the whole race. The influence of radios on race tactics is controversial, and some people think radios have led to less exciting racing. In September 2009, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body of pro cycling, voted to ban team radios in men's top level road racing.\nTypes of riders.\nDifferent cyclists have different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore a rider may prefer different events over particular courses, and perform different roles within a team.\nThe main types of rider in road bicycle racing are:\nTactics.\nA number of tactics are used to win a race. Tactics can be different in single stage races and stage races.\nDrafting.\nTactics are based on drafting. This is where a rider can reduce the effort needed to pedal by following the rider in front very closely. Riding with others in the main field, called the peloton, can save as much as 40% of the energy needed to ride alone. Riders can help each other to ride at high speed, or one rider can sit on a competitor's wheel, forcing him to do more work and get tired earlier. Some teams have a leader, and the rest of the team let him or her draft them to save their energy for the important bit of the race. Drafting is not allowed in individual time trials.\nBreaks.\nA small group of riders sometimes \"breaks away\" in front of the main group. When they work together a small group can sometimes go faster than the peloton, if the peloton does not organise to chase them. The riders in the breakaway try to win the race, and in the breakaway there are fewer rivals for the win.\nSprints.\nIf a break does not succeed and the peloton catches up with them, a sprinter will usually win the race by sprinting faster than everyone else in the final few hundred metres. The team works together to make sure their sprinter is in a good position to win.\nClimbs.\nClimbs are very good places for a single rider to try and leave the others behind. If the finish of the race is at the top of the climb, or not far past the top, a single rider can stay in front of the peloton and win the race.\nTactics in stage races.\nIn a stage race each day's stage is like a race within the bigger race. Each stage has a winner, either the first rider across the line, or in a time trial the rider or team with the quickest time. After each stage the general classification ranking is also worked out. The rider with the lowest total time for all the stages is the leader. The leader wears a special jersey for the next day's stage. \nIn multi-stage races, the GC leader will watch break-aways carefully if there is a rider close to him in the general classification. However often the GC leader will not react to a break-away. This happens if the escaping riders are a long way behind in the GC, and do not have a chance of taking the GC lead. Riders who are far behind often escapes because they want to win the stage or collect points for sprinting or climbing mountains. Riders may also go in a break-away to get television time for their team sponsors because the break-away often gets shown on the television coverage.\nImportant bicycle races.\nGrand tours (GT).\nThe most famous cycling race is the Tour de France, a stage race lasting three weeks. It takes place mostly in France, usually ending in Paris. Similar races are held in Italy (the Giro d'Italia) and Spain (the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a). These three races make up the \"grand tours\".\nUCI World Tour.\nProfessional racing is controlled by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). In 2005 it started the UCI World Tour. The World Tour includes the Grand Tours and other large stage races such as Tour Down Under, Tour de Suisse, Paris\u2013Nice and the Crit\u00e9rium de Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nSome one day races are also part of the World Tour: Milan \u2013 San Remo (Italy), Tour of Flanders (Belgium), Paris-Roubaix (France), Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge (Belgium) and Amstel Gold Race (Netherlands) in the spring, and Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n (Spain), HEW Cyclassics (Germany), Z\u00fcri-Metzgete (Switzerland), Paris\u2013Tours (France) and Giro di Lombardia (Italy) in the autumn season.\nOlympic Games.\nCycling has been at the Olympics since 1896. There are usually road race and individual time trial events for both men and women.\nWorld championships.\nThe other important one-day race is the World Championships. The World Championships is held on a different course each year and ridden by national rather than sponsored teams. The winner wears a white jersey with coloured bands (often called \"rainbow bands\") around the chest.\nSeason.\nIn Europe and in the United States, cycle racing on the road is a summer sport. The season can start in early spring and end in autumn. "}

Due to their links with the former Ducal family of Savoy the Prince was entitled to the highest rank at the Savoyard court and should the ruling Duke die without heirs the Prince was entitled to succeed to the Ducal throne. The Princes had a Palace in Turin called the \"Palazzo Carignano\". The title is similar to that of Prince of Cond\u00e9 in France.\nIt was a junior line of the House of Savoy. It was founded by Prince Thomas Francis of Savoy, Prince di Carignano 21 December 1596 \u2013 22 January 1656), an Italian military commander. His descendants were accepted as \"princes strangers\" (Foreign Princes) at the court of France, where some held prominent positions, eventually coming to reign as kings of Sardinia from 1831 to 1861 and as kings of Italy from 1861 until the dynasty's deposition in 1946. The Carignanos also, briefly, supplied a king each to Spain and to Croatia, as well as queens consort to Bulgaria and Portugal.\nFollowing the succession of Charles Albert to the throne the title was not used again the family preferring to use other titles named after Italian cities. The famous Princess Marie Louise of Savoy (\"princesse de Lamballe\") was a Savoyard princess of this line.\nStyles of address.\nSometimes the style of \"Highness\" was used but at the Savoyard and French courts the style of \"Serene Highness\" was more often than not used"}

One of its first leaders was Terence V. Powderly. The Knights started as a secret society with many elaborate rituals. By 1878 they became more of an open group. They greatly expanded their membership in the 1880s.\nHistory.\nThe Knights of Labor began during the era of labor unions. The Garment Cutters Association of Philadelphia failed and was dissolved on 9 December 1869. Several members voted to form a new organization. They were convinced their new union needed more secrecy. As they drew up plans for the new organization each member was required to take an oath of secrecy. The title for the presiding officer was \"Master Worker\" and other titles were similarly named. On December 28th they adopted the name of Knights of Labor. The membership fees were $1. In 1878 they held their first general meeting. The early Knights took up campaigning for an 8-hour workday. Child labor exploitation was another of their causes. About 20% of the Knights were women and black workers. The members were mainly working class people. Certain professions were banned from membership. This included lawyers, bankers, and stockbrokers. As a measure of how these occupations were viewed, saloon keepers and gamblers were also excluded. \nWorkers in the 1880s began going on strike to gain better . Only about half belonged to unions. There were an average of about 500 strikes a year between 1881 and 1885. In 1886 this increased to over 1400 strikes. On 4 May 1886 in Chicago a peaceful rally was held to support workers striking for an eight-hour day. Someone threw a bomb into the crowd at Haymarket square. At least eight police officers and several civilians were killed. Labor unions were blamed even though the person throwing the bomb was never caught. The press and the American people held labor unions responsible. As one of the largest labor organizations the knights of Labor were blamed more than the other unions. The Haymarket affair caused the decline of the Knights of Labor even though they were not directly involved. By the early 1900s they were all but gone."}

The were former President William Howard Taft and attorney Frank Walsh. Its purpose was to make sure labor strikes did not hurt the war effort. The board ended after the war in May 1919. The National War Labor Board was reestablished on January 12, 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The chairman was William Hammatt Davis. This board ended its duties.\nNational War Labor Board WW I.\nThe United States entered World War I in April 1917. Soon the government became concerned that labor strikes might stop the production of military equipment and supplies. In response President Woodrow Wilson created the National War Labor Board. The board recognized the worker's right to organize unions and bargain collectively. Former President Taft and labor attorney Frank Walsh were the co-chairmen. The board had little real power but depended on their ability to negotiate compromises between the two sides. They succeeded in preventing a number of strikes. After Germany was defeated the board was disbanded. In 1919 several strikes broke out in the coal and steel industries. The board supported an eight-hour day for workers and equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.\nNational War Labor Board WW II.\nThe National War Labor Board was started up again by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on January 12, 1942. The chairman was William Hammatt Davis. The board's job was to prevent labor disputes. Also to insure that higher wage settlements did not cause inflation. The board was generally favorable to unions. The board encouraged the use of fringe benefits instead of inflation-causing higher wages. In 1942 the board began a \"maintenance of membership\" policy which attracted new members into labor unions. Unions understood they had to minimize any activism among their members in order to gain favorable rulings from the NWLB. Dispite the efforts of labor unions there were wartime strikes. Most of these were unauthorized (by the unions) or wildcat strikes (non-union). The CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations), later part of the AFL-CIO, largely cooperated with the board. When the number of strikes peaked in 1944 CIO members maintained their no-strike pledge. By the time the war ended, membership in the CIO was nearly 5 million. The NWLB provided on an honorary basis, that is, without fees. But they encouraged paid arbitrators and by war's end most who arbitrated disputes were paid a fee of from $25\u2013$100 per day. In 1945 the board was disbanded. A wave of strikes broke out just the same as when the NWLB ended in 1918."}

It is the process where grains of sediment get stuck together. It is a chemical process, and the cement is a precipitate which crystallises in the spaces between the matrix of grains. Silica (SiO2) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are the most common types of cement.\nIons carried in groundwater precipitate to form new crystalline material in sediment pores: this is how \"sediment\" becomes \"rock\". The new pore-filling minerals form \"bridges\" between original sediment grains, thereby binding them together. So \"sand\" becomes \"sandstone\", and \"gravel\" becomes \"conglomerate\". \nCementation occurs mainly below the water table. Large volumes of pore water must pass through sediment pores for new mineral cements to crystallize and so millions of years are generally required to complete the cementation process. \nSedimentation does not always occur. Many quarries used for sand and gravel have them as loose particles and stones, just as if they came from a present-day beach. In England, most of these quarries are from beds laid down in the Jurassic, 150+ million years ago. By chance, the conditions for cementation have never occurred there."}

According to the government of Greenland, one person in five has attempted suicide. Because of this, the Greenland government has taken a number of steps to reduce the suicide rate. One example is roadside posters.\nHistory.\nThe number of suicides in Greenland began to rise in the 1970s. Before that it had been very low. It kept getting higher until 1986. In 1986, suicide was the leading cause of death in several towns, such as Sarfannguit. Before 1970, the rate of suicide in Greenland had been very low. But by 1994, it had become one of the highest in the world. The rate was 107 per 100,000 persons committing suicide per year. Government data in 2010 suggested that almost one suicide occurred a week.\nRates.\nAn article was published in the journal \"BMC Psychiatry\" in 2009. It reported that 1351 suicides took place in Greenland during the 35 years (1968\u20132002). The study noted seasonal changes in the suicide rate. Suicides were higher in June and lower in the winter months. Suicide rates in northern parts of West Greenland are higher than in southern parts. Suicide rates are higher for men than women. Most of the people committing suicide are young men between the ages of 15-24. Unlike in other Western countries, the suicide rate in Greenland goes down with age.\nReasons.\nSeveral reasons are blamed for Greenland's high rate of suicide. These including alcoholism, depression, poverty, poor relationships with partners and dysfunctional parental homes. The higher summer suicide rate is blamed on insomnia caused by longer periods of daylight.\nThe increase in suicide rates started about the time television appeared in Greenland. But it may be more the \"modernization package\" in general that is causing the problem. Culture clash between the traditional culture and modern Western culture is also assumed to be a factor.\nCommon methods.\nThe most common methods were hanging (46%) and shooting (37%). Other methods include jumping from heights, cutting with sharp objects, drowning, overdose of medication, and poisoning.\nSuicide prevention.\nGreenland's Government and other organizations have made a number of efforts to prevent suicides. There are different associations that provide support for people that feel suicidal. Measures include posters placed along the roads, which read: \"The call is free. No one is alone. Don't be alone with your dark thoughts. Call.\" Suicide consultants are used to show movies discouraging teenage suicide attempts."}

It was created after the murder of Megan Kanka. Individual states decide what information will be made available and how it should be distributed. Most give out the offender's name, picture, address, Prison date, and nature of the crime. The information is often displayed on free public websites, but can be published in newspapers, distributed in pamphlets, or through various other means.\nMegan Kanka.\nRichard and Maurine Kanka and their three children lived in a small town in New Jersey. On 29 July 1994 their daughter Megan was lured into a neighbor's house to see a non-existent puppy. There she was raped and murdered by her , Jesse Timmendequas. Timmendequas had just recently been released from prison after his second conviction on sexual offenses against children. He had served six of the ten years of his sentence. Searches for the girl turned up nothing. The local police quickly focused on three known sex offenders living across the street from the missing girl. Police released two of the suspects when they verified where they were. Timmendequas became the main suspect. He was released after several hours of . After obtaining a detectives searched Timmendequas's trash and found a piece of Megan Kanka's clothing. Timmendequas was questioned again and after several hours told police \"She's in the park.\" When police then asked if she was still alive Timmendequas said \"No, she's dead. I put a over her head.\"\nThe Kankas were outraged to find they were living across the street from a convicted child sex offender. Two days after her murder, the parents of Megan Kanka started the \"Megan Nichole Kanka Foundation\". The mission of the foundation is to identify the location of convicted child sex offenders in every community. \nThe Laws.\nMaurine Kanka began pushing for laws disclosing the need to notify residents of the presence of convicted sex offenders in their communities. New Jersey was the first state to pass a \"Megan's law.\" In 1995 the Supreme Court of New Jersey upheld the State law. The continuing efforts resulted in President Bill Clinton signing the federal version of \"Megan's Law.\" The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Law, or \"Megan's Law\", was signed in May 1996. This was the first part. The second, or notification part of the law, was signed on 13 November 1996. It gave states one year to pass state versions of Megan's law. The District of Columbia and forty-seven states met the deadline and passed their own versions of the law. The notification portion of the law requires states to make public information about all sex offenders. They may each choose how they want to implement that part. Under the law sex offenders are grouped in risk bands based on the nature and details of their offense. The public is not notified of 'low risk' sexual offenders. Information on 'Medium risk' offenders is disclosed to schools and . 'High risk' sexual offenders' information is disclosed to the public. \nShortcomings of Megan's law.\nMegan's law is not without problems."}

It is used mainly in the United States to describe buying something and quickly reselling (or \"flipping\") it for profit. It can apply to any asset but is often applied to real estate and initial public offerings (IPOs).\nReal estate.\nReal estate is bought and sold every day. The seller arranges for a realtor to advertise and sell their property. The realtor charges between 4 and 7 percent of the selling price as a commission. The sale is conducted between the owner of the property or house, and the who wants to purchase it. \nFlipping is used by real estate investors to describe someone purchasing a property then selling it quickly for a profit. Usually the investor will pay for improvements to make the property more attractive. The investor must have the money to buy the house and pay for the improvements. Realtors neither buy the house or resell it (although a realtor can also be a flipper). They simply broker the sale.\nFlipping involves a good deal of risk for investors. They must know the value of a property and not pay too much. They have to be careful not to invest too much in improvements. Very often run-down properties or are sold at auctions. The buyer may not be able to inspect the property before buying it. This can lead to additional costs to fix problems that could not be seen. A property needs to sell quickly or there is no quick return on their money. \nThere are also many risks for buyers of flipped homes.\nIPOs.\nInitial public offerings are when a private company sells shares of stock to the public for the first time (called going public). Flipping is buying stocks and selling within the first 2 to 3 days after the company went public. The hope is the price will go up rapidly. Underwriters want investors want to hold onto stocks. They may blacklist investors who flip too many stocks even though it is legal.\nOther forms.\nIn the United Kingdom the term is used to describe Members of Parliament switching their 'second home' between several houses. This was to maximize their taxpayer funded allowances."}

Louis Agassiz named it in 1835. He had been to Scotland, and seen Hugh Miller's collection. Miller described his collecting later, in a popular work on the rocks and fossils of the Old Red Sandstone in Scotland. Agassoz' single species has now been split into more species, some of which have been moved into a different genus.\nLifestyle.\n\"Cephalaspis\" was a medium-sized fish that lived in freshwater streams and estuaries of the early Devonian. Some of the fossils are well-preserved, and so we know quite a bit about its anatomy. Its armour was on the dorsal side, and its mouth on the ventral side. Therefore, it is likely that it was a bottom-feeder, nosing about in the mud of a river. It had a typical vertebrate type of brain, with front, middle and rear regions, and nerves to and from sense organs and muscles in the head region.\nIts pineal opening between its eyes was probably a light-sensitive organ. On its skull are three areas which obviously had a special function. Many modern fish which live in muddy rivers use both pressure-sensitive lateral lines, and also electrical fields to sense movement. \"Cephalaspis\" had no lateral lines, but the three fields on its skull were no doubt sensory, for sensing pressure change or electrical fields.\nThe animal had semi-circular canals to sense balance (one of the functions of our own semi-circular canals). They were capable of sustained swimming, and short rapid bursts. Almost all the fossils are found in strata laid down in freshwater conditions, so the various species live in rivers, streams connected with lakes and estuaries.\nSansom decided that \"Cephalaspis\" was the sister-taxon of cornuate osteostracans, which have defined corners on the head-shields."}

It established a national minimum wage (of 25\u00a2 per hour). It guaranteed \"time-and-a-half\" for overtime in certain jobs. The FLSA also prohibited most employment of minors in \"oppressive child labor\". The FLSA created a Wage and Hour Division in the Department of Labor. The statute applies to employees engaged in interstate commerce or employed by a business engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, unless the employer can claim an from these requirements.\nThe FLSA was originally written in 1932 by Senator Hugo Black. He was later appointed to the Supreme Court in 1937. However, Black's proposal to require employers to adopt a thirty-hour workweek met stiff resistance. In 1938 a revised version of Black's proposal was passed that adopted an eight-hour day and a forty-hour workweek. It allowed workers to earn wages for an extra four hours of overtime as well. According to the act, workers must be paid minimum wage and overtime pay must be one-and-a-half times regular pay. Children under eighteen cannot do certain dangerous jobs. Also children under the age of sixteen cannot work during school hours. There were 700,000 workers affected by the FLSA. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called it the most important piece of New Deal legislation passed since the Social Security Act of 1935."}

The character was not successful, and Siegel found a more familiar hero. Schuster modeled the character on Douglas Fairbanks, and his alter ego in glasses, Clark Kent, a combination of Harold Lloyd and Schuster himself, and the name \"Clark Kent\" comes from the stars of the films Clark Gable and Kent Taylor. Lois Lane was modeled after Joanna Carter, who was Joe's friend before she became Siegel's wife.\nThen Siegel and Schuster began a six-year search for a publisher. They called the project \"The Superman\" and brought it to Consolidated Book Publishing, which published a 48-page black-and-white comic book called \"Detective Dan: Secret Operative\" \u2116 48, but after that this cooperation finished. Schuster took this to heart and burned every page of the story, only the cover was saved. Siegel and Schuster compared this character to Slam Bradley, an adventurer the couple created for Detective Comics \u2116 1 (March, 1937). In 1938, editor Vin Sullivan chose it as a cover feature for National Action Comics \u21161 (June, 1938). The following year, Siegel and Schuster initiated a series of Superman comics.\nThen Siegel and Schuster sold the company's rights to $130 and a contract to supply to the publisher of Action Comics.\nSiegel and Schuster's status as children of Jewish immigrants is also believed to have an influence on their work. Timothy Aaron Pevey claimed that they had created \"a figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American,\" which Pevey felt was an important aspect of the American personality.\nWhen Superman first appeared, Clark Kent's Superman alter ego worked for the Daily Star, named Schuster after the Toronto Daily Star, his former employer in Toronto. Schuster said that he modeled the urban landscape of Superman's hometown of Metropolis from his old hometown. When the comic strip became international, the company was finally renamed the Daily Planet."}

Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into the north Atlantic. They have also been successfully transplanted into the north Pacific Ocean. Other names for Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, Sebago salmon, silver salmon, fiddler, or outside salmon. Atlantic salmon that don't journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon or ouananiche. This can be due to human interference or natural disasters.\nLife cycle.\nMost Atlantic salmon follow an life cycle. Once hatched, they are called alevins. They live off the nutrients in their yolk sac they were born with. Once they start feeding they are called fry. They grow into juveniles or parr and remain in fresh water for a number of years while growing. When they leave fresh water they are called smolts. Smolts leave the streams and move into the ocean for feeding and growth. The post-smolts change from territorial behavior to that of open ocean, possibly shoaling, fish. Their mortality rate while in the ocean is very high. The rate is from 90% to as high as 99%. After 1\u20135 years at sea they return to spawn in the same streams they were born in. Unlike most Pacific varieties Atlantic salmon are meaning they don't automatically die after their first spawning. But the stress of spawning, predators, or disease does kill many. The remainder return to sea to spawn again and again.\nThere is variety in the life cycle of Atlantic salmon. They do not require salt water. Numerous examples of fully fresh water landlocked Atlantic salmon exist throughout the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, the landlocked fish are called ouananiche. Fresh water Atlantic salmon are smaller than the (ocean-dwelling) Atlantic salmon."}

He was the 20th President of France from 1974 to 1981 during the Fifth Republic.\nBorn in Koblenz, Germany, Giscard d'Estaing began his political career as a Gaullist and slowly began to change his political thinking around the time he was the Minister of Finance when Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Pierre Messmer were prime ministers. \nHe won the presidential election of 1974 with 50.8% of the vote against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of the Socialist Party. His presidency was seen as liberal for his focus on divorce, contraception and abortion. His presidency helped modernise the country through his creation and growth of TGV and support of nuclear power as France's main energy source. However, he became unpopular because of a bad economy and the 1973 energy crisis, which many felt that it was the end of the \"Trente Glorieuses\". In 1981, he lost his re-election campaign to Mitterrand, with 48.2% of the vote.\nAfter his presidency, he was a member of the Constitutional Council. He also was President of the Regional Council of Auvergne from 1986 to 2004. Giscard d'Estaing focused on the European Union after his presidency. He was in charge of the Convention on the Future of Europe that created the unsuccessful treaty that would have created a constitution for Europe. In 2003, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. \nAt the time of his death at age 94 years and 304 days, Giscard d'Estaing was the longest-lived French president in history. He died in December 2020 from COVID-19.\nEarly life.\nGiscard d'Estaing was born on 2 February 1926 in Koblenz, Germany, during the French occupation of the Rhineland. He was the oldest son of Jean Edmond Lucien Giscard d'Estaing and his wife Marthe Cl\u00e9mence Jacqueline Marie (May) Bardoux.\nGiscard d'Estaing had an older sister, Sylvie and younger siblings Olivier, Isabelle, and Marie-Laure. \nHe joined the French Resistance and was part of the Liberation of Paris where he protected Alexandre Parodi. He then joined the French First Army. He was later awarded the \"Croix de guerre\" for his military service.\nHe studied at Lyc\u00e9e Blaise-Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand, \u00c9cole Gerson and Lyc\u00e9es Janson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He graduated from the \u00c9cole polytechnique and the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration. He later joined the Inspection des finances. He worked in the Tax and Revenue Service, then joined the staff of Prime Minister Edgar Faure from 1955 to 1956.\nEarly political career.\nIn 1956, Giscard d'Estaing was elected to the National Assembly as a deputy for the Puy-de-D\u00f4me \"d\u00e9partement\". He joined the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP), a conservative group. After the creation of the Fifth Republic, the CNIP leader Antoine Pinay became Minister of Economy and Finance and chose him as Secretary of State for Finances from 1959 to 1962.\nMember of the Gaullist majority.\nIn 1962, when Giscard d'Estaing was nominated as Minister of Economy and Finance, his party split up with the Gaullists and left the majority coalition. At first, Giscard d'Estaing was a supporter of French president Charles de Gaulle. He did not support this and founded the Independent Republicans (RI). During this time, he supported the United States dollar as a form of international payments.\nIn 1966, Giscard d'Estaing was removed from the cabinet. He made the RI into a political party, the National Federation of the Independent Republicans (FNRI), and founded the Perspectives and Realities Clubs. In 1969, Giscard d'Estaing supported a \"no\" vote in the constitutional referendum which focused on the regions and the Senate. De Gaulle had said that he would resign if the \"no\" won. After De Gaulle resigned, many of his supporters blamed Giscard d'Estaing for being responsible for De Gaulle's resignation. From 1967 to 1974, he was Mayor of Chamali\u00e8res.\nDuring the 1969 presidential campaign, he supported the winning candidate Georges Pompidou, after which he became the Minister of Economy and Finance again.\nPresident of France.\nPresidential election victory.\nIn 1974, after the death of President Georges Pompidou, Giscard d'Estaing announced his candidacy for the presidency. His two main challengers were Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand for the left and Jacques Chaban-Delmas, a former Gaullist Prime Minister. Jacques Chirac explained that Giscard d'Estaing was the best candidate to stop Mitterrand from being elected. In the election, Giscard d'Estaing beat Mitterrand by a small number of votes, winning 50.7% of the vote which was 425,000\u00a0votes. At 48, he was the third youngest president in French history at the time, after Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte and Jean Casimir-Perier. \nDomestic activities.\nWhen Giscard d'Estaing made it easier for people to get political asylum, he expanded health insurance, lowered the voting age to 18, and modernised the divorce law. He supported the creation of the TGV high speed train network and the Minitel telephone upgrade. He supported nuclear power. \nEconomically, Giscard d'Estaing's presidency increased personal incomes, as employment went up 29% and pensions by 65%.\nGiscard d'Estaing tried to make the presidency look less like a monarchy. He rode the M\u00e9tro, ate monthly dinners with citizens, and even invited garbage men from Paris to have breakfast with him in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Many of his critics believed that Giscard was not formal enough to be president.\nMany conservatives that supported him slowly began to criticise him because he helped legalise abortion. Even though he was against the death penalty, Giscard d'Estaing said in his 1974 campaign that he would support the death penalty for some criminals. He did not remove three death sentences that happened during his presidency, making France the last country in the Europe to take part of death penalty. \nPrime Minister Jacques Chirac, who resigned in 1976, began to criticise Giscard d'Estaing's leadership and later became political enemies with him.\nForeign activities.\nGiscard d'Estaing was a close friend of West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and together they helped create the European Monetary System. They also helped make the Soviet Union support the Helsinki Accords. \nHe supported creation of the European Council at the Paris Summit in December 1974.\nIn 1975, Giscard d'Estaing made the King of Spain Juan Carlos I to ban Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from his coronation by saying that if Pinochet went, he would not. Although France accepted many Chilean political refugees, Giscard d'Estaing's government secretly worked with Pinochet's and Argentina's Jorge Rafael Videla's dictatorship governments.\nGiscard d'Estaing supported de Gaulle's African policy where supported delivering oil supplies to and from Africa. In 1977, in the Op\u00e9ration Lamantin, he ordered the French military to go to Mauritania and stop the Polisario guerrillas fighting against Mauritania.\nGiscard d'Estaing became controversial for his support of Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa in the Central African Republic. Due to the growing unpopularity of that government, he began to slowly criticise Bokassa. In 1979's Operation Caban, French troops helped remove Bokassa from power and made former president David Dacko the new leader. \nThe Diamonds Affair, known in France as \"l'affaire des diamants\", was a major political scandal in the Fifth Republic. In 1973, while Minister of Finance, Giscard d'Estaing was given diamonds by Bokassa. Many believe this is what made him lose his re-election.\nRe-election loss.\nIn the 1981 presidential election, Giscard d'Estaing's re-election was in trouble because former Prime Minister Chirac ran against him. Chirac finished third and did not tell his supporters to vote for Giscard in the second round of the election. Giscard d'Estaing lost to Mitterrand by 3 points in the runoff, ending a 23-year conservative presidential span. He blamed Chirac for his defeat.\nGiscard d\u2019Estaing was seen as an important person in modernising France and making the European Union strong. He was popular because his presidency passed many small social reforms, such as lowering the voting age by three years, allowing divorce by common consent, and legalising abortion. \nHowever, he was unable to fix the great economic crisis of his term, a worldwide economic recession caused by a massive increase in oil prices. His foreign policy was remembered for his close relationship with West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Together they helped expand and made Europe's economic power stronger as they pushed for the European Monetary System and helped create the G-7 system.\nPost-presidency.\nAfter he lost in 1981, Giscard d'Estaing retired for a short time from politics. In 1984, he was re-elected to his seat in the National Assembly and won the presidency of Auvergne. He was President of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions from 1997 to 2004.\nIn 1982, along with former U.S. President Gerald Ford, Giscard d'Estaing co-founded the annual AEI World Forum. He has also was a member of the Trilateral Commission after being president.\nGiscard d'Estaing hoped to become prime minister after the re-election of Mitterrand, but he was not chosen for this job. During the 1988 presidential campaign, he did not support two of his two former Prime Ministers Jacques Chirac and Raymond Barre.\nGiscard d'Estaing was President of the UDF from 1988 to 1996. Most of the UDF politicians supported the candidacy of the RPR Prime Minister \u00c9douard Balladur at the 1995 presidential election, but Giscard d'Estaing supported Chirac, who won the election. \nIn 2000, he created a proposal to limit the length of a presidential term from seven to five years, a proposal that eventually won its referendum proposal by President Chirac. Following his retirement from the National Assembly his son Louis Giscard d'Estaing was elected.\nIn 2003, Giscard d'Estaing became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. In 2004, he became a member of the Constitutional Council. His support for creating a European Constitution, were criticised. Many believed Giscard should have been removed from the council and be given a life membership in the Senate.\nHe supported the presidential campaigns of Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon in 2017. In 2013, Giscard d'Estaing supported same-sex marriage in France.\nOn 21 January 2017, he became the oldest former president in French history.\nEuropean activities.\nGiscard d'Estaing was a supporter of a stronger European Union. From 1989 to 1993, Giscard d'Estaing was a member of the European Parliament. From 1989 to 1991, he was also chairman of the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group.\nFrom 2001 to 2004, he was President of the Convention on the Future of Europe. On 29 October 2004, the European heads of state approved and signed the European Constitution based on a draft supported by Giscard d'Estaing's work at the Convention. Although the constitution was not approved by French voters in May 2005, Giscard d'Estaing continued to support for its passage in other European Union states. \nGiscard d'Estaing was a supporter of the Lisbon Treaty. \nIn 2008 he became the Honorary President of the Permanent Platform of Atomium Culture. On 27 November 2009, Giscard d'Estaing started the Permanent Platform of Atomium Culture during its first meeting, held at the European Parliament.\nPersonal life.\nGiscard d'Estaing's name was often shortened to \"VGE\". He was also known as \"l'Ex\", especially during the time he was the only living former president.\nOn 17 December 1952, Giscard d'Estaing married Anne-Aymone Sauvage de Brantes. His family did not live in the presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace during his presidency. In 1974, \"Le Monde\" reported that he used to leave a letter about where he was in case of an emergency.\nIn May 2020, Giscard d'Estaing was accused of touching a German journalist's buttocks during an interview in 2018. He denied the accusations, saying that he never did this, however apologised to the reporter.\nIn 2005, he and his brother bought the castle of Estaing. However, many newspapers in different countries why they bought with many believing they wanted to become French nobility. It was put up for sale in 2008 for \u20ac3 million It is now owned by the Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing Foundation.\nGiscard d'Estaing wrote his second romantic novel, published on 1 October 2009 in France, titled \"The Princess and the President\". It tells the story of a French leader having a romantic affair with a character called Patricia, Princess of Cardiff. This caused many rumours that the book was based on a real-life affair between Giscard d'Estaing and Diana, Princess of Wales. He later said that such an affair never happened and that the book was fictional.\nDeath.\nOn 14 September 2020, Giscard d'Estaing was hospitalised for breating problems at the H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou in Paris.

This was particularly during the Little Ice Age of the mid 18th century. The grain harvest was badly affected. Many ideas to make the flour last longer were introduced. In 1742, samples of \u201cemergency bread\u201d were sent from Kristiansand, Norway to the Royal Administration in Copenhagen. One of these was bark bread. This is bread made from grain and bread made from burned bones. During the Napoleonic Wars, moss too was used for food.\nThe last time bark bread was used as famine food in Norway was during the Napoleonic Wars. The introduction of the potato as a staple crop gave the farmers other crops when grain production failed. So that bark bread and moss cakes were no longer needed. In Northern Sweden, traces of Sami harvest of bark from Scots pine are known from the 1890s. In Finland \"pettuleip\u00e4\" (literally \"pinewood-bark bread\") was produced as a substitute for bread during the Finnish Civil War of 1918."}

It is now the third deadliest behind Virginia Tech and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. It is still the deadliest non-school shooting rampage in American history.\nAfter the massacre, the Texas Legislature passed a shall-issue gun law in 1995, which required all qualifying applicants be issued a Concealed Handgun License (which is Texas' required permit to carry concealed weapons). To qualify for a license, the person must be free-and-clear of crimes, attend a minimum 10-hour class which is taught by a state-certified instructor, pass a 50-question test, show a high amount of skill in a 50-round shooting test, and must pass two background tests, one shallow and one deep.

The law was campaigned by shooting survivor Suzanna Hupp and was signed by then-Governor George W. Bush.\nThe restaurant closed down on September 9, 2000.

{"id": "440762", "revid": "631927", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440762", "title": "Long-term memory", "text": "Long-term memory (LTM) is our memory of past events. It follows from short-term memory, and involves the growth of nerve synapses which are very long-lasting.\nTypes of LTM.\nThe brain does not store memories in one unified structure, as might be seen in a computer's hard disk drive. Instead, different types of memory are stored in different regions of the brain. Long term memory is typically divided up into two major headings: explicit memory and implicit memory.\nExplicit memory.\nExplicit or 'declarative' memory refers to memories which can be consciously recalled such as facts and knowledge. These are partly encoded by the hippocampus, stored elsewhere. Exactly where is unknown, but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate. Research shows that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit learning tests than did healthy controls. However, the same patients performed at the same rate as healthy controls on \"implicit\" learning tests. This implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning, but not in implicit learning. \nImplicit Memory.\nImplicit or procedural memory refers to the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil, drive a car, or ride a bicycle. This type of memory is encoded and it is presumed stored by the striatum and other parts of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is believed to mediate procedural memory and other brain structures and is largely independent of the hippocampus. The parietal and occipital regions are associated with implicit memory.\nEmotional memory.\nThe memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion may involve both declarative and procedural memory processes. Emotional memories are consciously available, but elicit a powerful, unconscious physiological reaction. Research indicates that the amygdala is extremely active during emotional situations, and acts with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the encoding and consolidation of emotional events.\nWorking memory.\nWorking memory (STM) is not part of long term memory, but is important for long term memory to work. Working memory holds and works on information for a short period before it is either forgotten or put into long term memory. Then, to remember something from long term memory, it must come back into working memory. If working memory is overloaded it can affect the encoding of long term memory. "}

It had long been a place for travellers to stop when crossing the Syrian Desert. The city was founded some time during the 2nd millennium BC. It became abandoned around 1929. The site was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.\nThe Semitic name of the city is (). In Aramaic, it means \"a city that cannot be defeated\". The earliest written reference to the city by this name is on Babylonian tablets found in Mari. It is still known as Tadmur in Arabic.\nThe people of Palmyra worshipped many gods and goddesses from Mesopotamia, Syria, Arabia and Greece. They built a series of temples and large monuments containing funerary art, or art representing the dead. Palmyrans originally spoke Aramaic, but later began speaking Greek. \nThe area was later made a part of the Roman Empire. The city was important because of the \"silk commerce\" from Rome toward the China region in eastern Asia. Between the years 260 and 273, Odaenathus and his wife Zenobia used Palmyra as the capital of the Palmyrene Empire. This period of Roman history is called the Crisis of the Third Century.\nBy the time of the Muslim conquests, a few Arab tribes were living in Palmyra.\nThe city lost its importance after the 16th century. It was fully abandoned by 1929, during the Ottoman Empire. There is a new town of the same name nearby to the south of the ruins.\nDuring the Syrian Civil War in 2015, the Islamic State (ISIS) destroyed large parts of the ancient city.

The term was translated from French; A.M. Amp\u00e8re used the term \"cin\u00e9matique\". He constructed the term form the Greek , kinema (movement, motion), derived from , kinein (to move). The study of \"kinematics\" is often referred to as the \"geometry of motion.\"\nTo describe motion, kinematics studies the paths of points, lines and other geometric objects in space, and some of their properties such as velocity and acceleration. Astrophysics uses kinematics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and systems. Mechanical engineering, robotics and biomechanics use it to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts such as an engine, a robotic arm or the skeleton of the human body.\nThe study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely mathematical functions. It is possible to represent rotation with elements of the unit circle in the complex plane. Other planar algebras are used to represent the shear mapping of classical motion in absolute time and space and to represent the Lorentz transformations of relativistic space and time. Mathematicians have developed a science of kinematic geometry, which uses time as a parameter.\nCertain geometric transformations which are called rigid transformations have been developed to describe the movement of components of a mechanical system. These transformations simplify the derivation of its equations of motion, and is central to dynamic analysis.\nKinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic quantities used to describe motion. In engineering, kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given mechanism, and, working in reverse, kinematic synthesis designs a mechanism for a desired range of motion. In addition, \"kinematics\" applies algebraic geometry to the study of the mechanical advantage of a mechanical system, or mechanism."}

It is produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.\nThe movie is about a princess named Anna, and her sister Elsa who becomes queen. There is also a talking snowman called Olaf. In the popular movie, Elsa sings a song called \"Let It Go,\" which became very popular and it is a 52nd movie. \"Frozen\" was released on November 27, 2013, and has the voices of Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel in speaking and singing roles.\n\"Frozen\" got great reviews from movie critics. It was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film.\nPlot.\nAnna and Elsa are two princess sisters who live in Arendelle. Elsa, now queen of Arendelle, has the power of working with snow and ice, but her power gets out of control and upsets the people of Arendelle. Not wanting to hurt anyone, Elsa runs away and makes her own palace for herself. Meanwhile, Anna sets off in the snow and ice to bring Elsa back and make things right with her. On the way, she meets Kristoff, a friendly iceman, and Olaf, a funny snowman made alive by Elsa and who dreams of seeing summer.\nHans wants to marry Anna, but he tells her he only wants to marry her to destroy Elsa and get her royal status. As Hans raises his sword over Elsa, Anna stops Hans and as a result turns to a frozen statue. Elsa weeps out of love for the frozen Anna, and this thaws Anna back to life. Seeing this, Olaf realizes that an act of true love is what thaws a frozen heart. With the power of love, Elsa stops the icy spell over Arendelle, and all of Arendelle live happily ever after, including Olaf, who is able to see summer with a snow flurry over his head to keep the summer heat from melting him.\nProduction.\nPlans to make a movie based on \"The Snow Queen\" were started in the 1940s. The writers were not sure how its story could go and so the movie could not be made. Later, in 2011, the writers finally found a story to use for the movie and the production team began making the movie, naming it \"Frozen\". The plans said that \"Frozen\" would be hand-drawn, but the team later decided to use computer animation. It took only two years to make \"Frozen\", which was a very fast production time for a computer-animated movie.\n\"Frozen\" is also probably one of the most difficult animated movies to make. The animation team had to travel to a snowy area in Wyoming so that they could study the behavior of snow and simulate that with a computer. They also used a program that could generate a lot of strands for Elsa's hair. An average human has about 100,000 strands of hair, while Elsa's hair was made of 400,000 strands.\nSongs.\nThis is a list of songs heard in the movie \"Frozen\". These can be found on the movie's soundtrack CD. The CD also contains the background music pieces used for \"Frozen\". Most of the songs were made by husband and wife Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, while the movie's background music was made by Christophe Beck. The first song in the movie, \"Frozen Heart,\" was made by South Sami composer Frode Fjellheim and is in a traditional Sami style called Vuelie.\nCriticism.\nThe character Kristoff is meant to be Sami, a member of an indigenous group that lives in northern Europe. Some viewers complained that Kristoff was not a good way to show Sami because he is light-skinned and blond. Although, today, some Sami look like Kristoff, most have darker skin and hair. When making the 2019 sequel, \"Frozen II\", Disney signed a contract with Sami leaders and hired Sami experts to make sure the culture would be shown respectfully.\nSequels.\n\"Frozen Fever\" (2015).\nFrozen Fever is a short movie made by Walt Disney Animation Studios. It continues the events of \"Frozen\". It was released with the longer movie \"Cinderella\" on March 13, 2015. The movie is about Elsa who catches a cold and finds it hard to surprise Anna on her birthday. \"Frozen Fever\" runs for about 8 minutes. It has one new song sung by Elsa.\n\"Olaf's Frozen Adventure\" (2017).\nOlaf's Frozen Adventure is a short movie made by Walt Disney Animation Studios. It was released with the longer movie \"Coco\" on November 22, 2017. It was later shown on ABC on December 14. The short movie is about Olaf the snowman who is looking for the best holiday traditions for Anna. It runs for about 21 minutes. It has four new songs.\n\"Frozen II\" (2019).\nThe full length sequel, \"Frozen II\", was released on November 22, 2019."}

On May 25, 2002, the Boeing 747-209B airplane broke apart while flying over the Taiwan Straits and crashed into the water. It happened about 25 minutes after takeoff. The accident was caused by metal fatigue in the rear part of the plane. This was traced back to an incorrect repair that was done 22 years before the accident. All 225 people on board the plane were killed.\nAircraft history.\nThe Boeing 747-209B that flew China Airlines Flight 611 was registered as B-1866. This was changed to B-18255 on May 18, 1999. The plane was delivered to China Airlines on July 31, 1979. It was powered by 4 Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines. At time of crash it had flown for 64,394 hours, taking off and landing 21,180 times.\nOn February 7, 1980 the tail of the plane struck the runway while landing at Hong Kong airport. The plane was then ferried back to Taipei. A temporary repair was done on February 8, 1980, while a permanent repair was done from May 23 to 26, 1980. Later it was discovered the repair was not done to Boeing repair standards. It was also discovered that from 1997 a total of 29 corrosion inspections were not completed. When the repair patch was recovered from the crash site, there was evidence that deep scratches had been polished out, thinning the metal. Several fatigue cracks were found in the scratches. Crash estimate a crack of about 71 inches may have caused the plane to break up.\nCrew of Flight.\nThe captain was Yi Ching-Fung (in Traditional Chinese, \u6613\u6e05\u8c50), who was 51 years old. He joined China Airlines in 1991 before becoming a captain in 1997. He had flown for 10,148 hours. First Officer Hsieh Ya Shiung (In Traditional Chinese, \u8b1d\u4e9e\u96c4), who was 52 years old, joined China Airlines in 1990. He had flown for a total of 10,173 hours.\nAs the Boeing 747-200B was an older type of airplane, a flight engineer was needed. The flight engineer on this flight was Sen Kuo Chao (in Traditional Chinese, \u8d99\u76db\u570b). He joined China Airlines in 1977 and had a total flying time of 19,117 hours.\nAll three pilots had more than 24 hours of rest before this flight.\nPassengers.\nOn the flight to Hong Kong, there were 190 Taiwanese passengers. Of the rest 16, 9 were from the People's Republic Of China and 5 were from Hong Kong. There were also 1 Singaporean and 1 Swiss.\nAll 19 crew came from Taiwan.\nAccident.\nOn May 25, 2002, B-18255 was actually going to be sold to Orient Thai Airlines. This was the plane's last day of service with China Airlines. Takeoff was at 3.07 pm, and the plane was cleared to climb to 20,000 feet. At 3.16 pm the plane was again cleared to climb and maintain 35,000 feet. At about 3.30 pm, the plane was about to reach 35,000 feet when it suddenly disappeared from the radar systems of the air traffic controllers. Communications were also lost. No distress signals were sent out. However, two Cathay Pacific planes nearby received flight 611's emergency location-indicator signals.\nLater, the investigators discovered that flight 611 broke apart in mid-air when as it was reaching 35,000 feet. All 225 people on the plane were killed. This was one of the worst disaster in aviation history involving explosive decompression. China Airlines has had nine fatal crashes between 1970 and 2002. This is the worst record in commercial aviation.\nRecovery of Wreckage and Human Remains.\nShortly after the plane vanished, Taiwan launched one of the country's largest search-and-rescue operations. As the plane broke apart in mid-air, wreckage were spread over a large area and this makes it difficult to recover all the wreckage. When the search-and-rescue teams arrived, they realised they could not do anything; all 225 people onboard were dead.\nWhen there was no more hope for survivors, the teams started to recover wreckage and human remains. These were sent to Penghu Islands. There, the wreckage were numbered and the human remains were sent for identification. In the end, out of 225 people on board, 175 bodies were recovered. 50 remain in the sea.\nInvestigation.\nThe investigation of the crash was by Aviation Safety Council (ASC) of Taiwan. During the investigation, it was found that the crash of China Airlines Flight 611 was similar with another crash, TWA flight 800. Investigators found out that both crashes had similar points such as:\nHowever, unlike flight 800, investigators determined that flight 611 was not caused by a fuel tank explosion.\nAs the investigation continues, both recorders of the flight were recovered. However, investigators could not find any possible cause from the recorders as the flight data recorder showed that the plane was working properly before it broke up. The cockpit voice recorder also showed nothing unusual. The recorder started ten minutes before the flight. After a last sentence said by captain Yi Ching-Fung, \"two thousand\" at 3.26pm, the recorder captured nothing more spoken. Then, the sound of the plane breaking up was heard at about 3.29pm.\nWith nothing possible showing up, investigators decided to use a method that the investigators of TWA Flight 800 used. Using several pieces of wreckage, investigators were able to use a computer and find out which piece fell off first. This provided a major clue-the wreckage from the back of the plane fell first. So, investigators began looking for wreckage from the back of the plane.\nFinally, investigators managed to find a piece of wreckage which was damaged in the tailstrike incident in 1980. A doubler plate was placed over the scratches that the tailstrike caused. The piece, item number 640, was sent to Taipei for further examination.\nCause.\nWhen investigators removed the doubler that was installed over Item 640, they found out that the scratches, caused by the tailstrike 22 years ago, were still there. This was not the proper way to repair the damage from the tailstrike. From this investigators found out what really happened 22 years ago.\nAccording to the Boeing SRM (Structural Repair Manual), the scratches should be sanded down. But as the scratches caused by the tailstrike were too deep, the correct way to repair is to cut out the damaged section, then put a doubler plate that is 30% larger than the section that was cut out. However, in the repair of the accident plane, the workers did not follow the instructions. Instead they just placed a doubler plate over the damaged section, which was not 30% larger than the section that was supposed to be cut out. This weakened the structure behind the doubler. The workers then made one more mistake, by writing in the repair log that the repair was done correctly. So, anyone reading the log book would assume that the repair was done correctly and that the workers had cut out the damaged section and replaced it.\nOver the years, the cracks under the doubler grew worse and worse. Every time the plane took off and landed the cracks increased in length, in the end reaching 2.3 metres. Then, on May 25, 2002, the cracks reached the breaking point. It grew in all directions and caused the whole tail to break away from the plane. The plane went into a steep dive and was torn apart.\nChina Airlines Maintenance.\nAnother possible reason why the mistake could not be found out is that the maintenance procedures of China Airlines. In 1988, the roof of Aloha Airlines Flight 243 peeled off when the plane was cruising, causing explosive decompression. The plane landed safely. After the accident, the FAA ordered that the airlines evaluate again all the previous repairs that was done on planes.\nChina Airlines began evaluating the repairs in 2001. The workers took photographs of 31 different doublers on different 747s, including the one on B-18255. Although there was a stain on the doubler, the workers chose to ignore it. The stain was actually caused by smoke as passengers were allowed to smoke until 1995. The smoke was forced out through the crack and nicotine stained the plane's skin. It was said in Mayday that if China Airlines went on to find out how the stain formed, they may find out the cracks and prevent the crash.\nThe workers then scheduled the next maintenance check, 7C, on November 2, 2002. The check would definitely have led the workers to find out the cracks. However, the plane crashed 5 months before the check.\nAfter the crash.\nChina Airlines no longer uses 611 as its flight number."}

It was developed as a chemical weapon for use in war by Nazi Germany.\nIt is classified as a weapon of mass destruction in UN Resolution 687. Production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, and it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance according to the convention. That means that is a very dangerous chemical that has no use outside of chemical warfare.\nSarin can be lethal even at very low concentrations. Death comes in 1 to 10 minutes after breathing it in. It paralyses lung muscles. Antidotes, such as atropine, can save a person if given immediately.\nPeople who get a non-lethal dose, but do not get immediate treatment, may suffer permanent neurological damage.\nHow sarin works.\nLike other nerve agents, sarin attacks the nervous system by stopping nerve endings in muscles from switching off. Death will usually occur as a result of asphyxia due to the inability to control the muscles involved in breathing function.\nIn vertebrates, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction, where signals are transmitted between neurons from the central nervous system to muscle fibres.\nNormally, acetylcholine is released from the neuron to stimulate the muscle, after which it is degraded by acetylcholinesterase. This allows the muscle to relax. Inhibition of cholinesterase means the neurotransmitter continues to act on the muscle fibre. This stops breathing.\nHistory.\nSarin was discovered in 1938 in Wuppertal-Elberfeld in Germany by scientists at IG Farben attempting to create stronger pesticides. it is the most toxic of the four G-Series nerve agents made by Germany. The name \"sarin\" comes from letters in the scientists' names: Gerhard Schrader, Otto Ambros, Gerhard Ritter, and Hans-J\u00fcrgen von der Linde.\nIn mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the chemical warfare section of the German Army Weapons Office, which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use. It was not used in World War II.\nProperties.\nSarin is a liquid. It has no color and no smell. However, sarin that is not pure can look brown and smell like burnt rubber. It is miscible in water, which means that it can dissolve in water. Sarin melts at \u221256 \u00b0C and boils at 158 \u00b0C.\nToxicity.\nSarin is very dangerous, whether someone touches it or breathes it in. The LD50 of sarin is 172 \u03bcg/kg. This means that a group of people were injected with 172\u03bcg of sarin per kilogram of body weight, 50% of the people in that group would die. This was determined when scientists injected mice with sarin. They then did calculations to determine the ratio of sarin per kilogram and get the LD50.\nPure sarin is estimated to be 26 times more deadly than cyanide.\nProduction.\nSarin is made by mixing different chemicals together. It is difficult and dangerous for the average person to make sarin or get many of the chemicals needed to make sarin.\n1) Methylphosphonyl difluoride with isopropyl alcohol. Hydrofluoric acid is made as a byproduct of the reaction:\n2) Methylphosphonyl difluoride and methylphosphonic dichloride. This is called the \"Di-di\" process. Hydrochloric acid is made as a byproduct:\nBoth methods leave a lot of acid behind. This is a problem because acid will corrode the containers used to store sarin in.\nStorage.\nSarin is hard to store because the bond between the phosphorus and the fluorine is easily broken. That's why it is stored as two separate chemicals that create sarin when they are mixed.\nSarin decomposes at a high pH. First, it breaks down to isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA). Then it breaks down to methylphosphonic acid (MPA). IMPA can be detected to find out if sarin was used somewhere because it is a chemical not found in nature.\nSymptoms.\nIn medicine, the acronym SLUDGE is used to remember some of the symptoms of sarin poisoning:\nOther symptoms of sarin poisoning include:"}

It controls what gets from the bloodstream into the brain, and what does not.\nFor example, things that the brain needs to survive (water, glucose, and amino acids) can get through the barrier. However, the barrier stops many harmful things, like bacteria and viruses, from getting into the brain. This helps protect the brain from getting an infection.\nThe blood-brain barrier is formed by capillary endothelial cells. It allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion. It also allows the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids which are crucial to nerve function. On the other hand, the blood-brain barrier may prevent the entry of neurotoxins by means of an active transport mechanism. \nA few small areas in the brain do not have a blood-brain barrier. \nDiscovery.\nPaul Ehrlich, a German doctor, discovered the blood-brain barrier. He injected dye into mice's bloodstreams. The dye got to every organ except the brain. The blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting through to the brain. Then one of Ehrlich's students injected the dye right into the mice's brains. This time the brain turned blue, but no other organs did. The blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting out of the brain into the bloodstream (which would have carried the dye to every other organ in the body).\nFunction.\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier protects the brain from many common infections. Infections of the brain are rare. If they do happen, they are often serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies (which the body's immune system makes to fight infections) are too large to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Also, many antibiotics cannot pass through the BBB to kill the infection in the brain. \nOne way to get medications into the brain is to inject them into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF helps protect the brain and spinal cord. However, it does not actually touch the brain. Instead, two of the layers that protect the brain and spinal cord hold the CSF. Because of this, even if medications are injected right into the CSF, they still do not get into the brain very well. \nSome bacteria, viruses, and other things can get through the blood-brain barrier and damage the brain. For example:"}

It was used starting in 2011.\nWithin the forward edge of battle, the PTA is a unique gap crossing solution. The modularity offered by the PTA also provides a tactical advantage for vehicles up to class MLC 80. Since 2009, the Modular Assault Bridge has been commissioned into the French Army under the name SPRAT (Syst\u00e8me de Pose Rapide de Travure - rapid bridge layer system).\nIn front of the breach, it is capable of deploying two short 14.3 m bridges or one long 26 m bridge.\nThe bridge is deployed from the armored cab, thus ensuring operator safety. Rapid horizontal deployment (10 minutes with 2 operators for the long bridge) ensures operational discretion.\nThanks to its stabilizing legs, the PTA can establish a bridge from unprepared banks (inclination of +/- 5%, slope of +/- 10%).\nThe high mechanical strength of the PTA's bridges allows the crossing of vehicles up to class MLC 80 over a gap of up to 24 meters in a repetitive manner as they are stress and fatigue qualified according to the FINABEL code.\nEquipped with a digital, automated combat system (including an IR camera, operator interface and telemetry), the Modular Assault Bridge can be used day or night.\nWeighing less than 60 metric tons, it can be driven on ordinary roads and can also be transported by air.\nThe assault bridge SPRAT is manufactured by the French company CNIM."}

This is equivalent to the following statement: for every element \"b\" in the codomain \"B\", there is \"exactly\" one element \"a\" in the domain \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\". Another name for bijection is 1-1 correspondence (read \"one-to-one correspondence).\nThe term \"bijection\" and the related terms \"surjection\" and \"injection\" were introduced by Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics.\nBasic properties.\nFormally:\nwhere the element formula_5 is called the image of the element formula_6, and the element formula_6 the pre-image of the element formula_5. \nThe formal definition can also be interpreted in two ways: \nNote: Surjection means minimum one pre-image. Injection means maximum one pre-image. So bijection means exactly one pre-image.\nCardinality.\nCardinality is the \"number\" of elements in a set. The cardinality of \"A\"={X,Y,Z,W} is 4. This can be written as #\"A\"=4.\nBy definition, two sets \"A\" and \"B\" have the same cardinality if there is a bijection between the sets. So #\"A\"=#\"B\" means there is a bijection from A to B.\nBijections and inverse functions.\nBijections and inverse functions are related to each other, in that a bijection is invertible, can be turned into its inverse function by reversing the arrows.\nFormally:\nLet \"f\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"A\" \u2192 \"B\" be a bijection. The inverse function \"g\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"B\" \u2192 \"A\" is defined by if \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\", then \"g\"(\"b\")=\"a\". (See also Inverse function.) \nNote: The notation for the inverse function of \"f\" is confusing. Namely,\nExamples.\nElementary functions.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\"):\u211d\u2192\u211d be a real-valued function \"y\"=\"f\"(\"x\") of a real-valued argument \"x\". (This means both the input and output are numbers.)\nProving that a function is a bijection means proving that it is both a surjection and an injection. So formal proofs are rarely easy. Below we \"discuss\" and do not prove. (See surjection and injection.)\nExample: The linear function of a slanted line is a bijection. That is, \"y\"=\"ax\"+\"b\" where \"a\"\u22600 is a bijection.\nExample: The polynomial function of third degree: \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"3 is a bijection. Image 2 and image 5 thin yellow curve. Its inverse is the cube root function \"f\"(\"x\")= \u221b\"x\" and it is also a bijection \"f\"(\"x\"):\u211d\u2192\u211d. Image 5: thick green curve.\nExample: The quadratic function \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\"2 is not a bijection (from \u211d\u2192\u211d). Image 3. It is not a surjection. It is not an injection. However, we can restrict both its domain and codomain to the set of non-negative numbers (0,+\u221e) to get an (invertible) bijection (see examples below).\nNote: This last example shows this. To determine whether a function is a bijection we need to know three things:\nExample: Suppose our function \"machine\" is \"f\"(\"x\")=\"x\"\u00b2. \nBijections and their inverses.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\"):\"A\"\u2192\"B\" where \"A\" and \"B\" are subsets of \u211d.\nExample: The quadratic function defined on the restricted domain and codomain [0,+\u221e)\nis a bijection. Image 6: thin yellow curve.\nExample: The square root function defined on the restricted domain and codomain [0,+\u221e) \nis the bijection defined as the inverse function of the quadratic function: \"x\"\"2\". Image 6: thick green curve.\nExample: The exponential function defined on the domain \u211d and the restricted codomain (0,+\u221e) \nis a bijection. Image 4: thin yellow curve (\"a\"=10).\nExample: The logarithmic function base \"a\" defined on the restricted domain (0,+\u221e) and the codomain \u211d\nis the bijection defined as the inverse function of the exponential function: \"a\"\"x\".

It has five main concerns:\nHistory and development.\nModern historical linguistics dates from the late 18th century. It grew out of the earlier discipline of philology, the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to antiquity.\nAt first, historical linguistics was comparative linguistics. The focus was on the well-known Indo-European languages, many of which had long written histories. Scholars also studied the Uralic languages, another language family for which less early written material exists.\nSince then, there has been linguistic work in non-European languages, such as on the Austronesian languages and various families of Native American languages.\nComparative linguistics is now part of a discipline of historical linguistics. For Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a well-developed field. Most research is being carried out on their later development, such as the development of the modern standard varieties.\nSome scholars have done studies attempting to establish super-families. They have, for example, linked Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into Nostratic. Such attempts have not been accepted widely. The information needed to establish relatedness becomes thinner the farther back. The time depth of linguistic methods is limited because of chance word resemblances and variations between language groups. Scholars can trace language changes back to around 10,000 years. The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results are possible."}

These include the Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic and Kartvelian languages. The Afroasiatic languages, native to North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Near East, as well as the Dravidian languages of the Indian subcontinent, are usually included as well.\nThe name \"Nostratic\" is derived from the Latin \"nostrates\", meaning \"us\" (in other words, fellow countrymen). The idea was expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, called the \"Moscovite school\" by Bomhard. It has received renewed attention in English-speaking academia since the 1990s.\nThe hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide. Some linguists are unsure.\nThe hypothetical ancestral language of the Nostratic family is called Proto-Nostratic.

It is a meaningful sign of social communication, but exactly what it means depends on the situation. The customs and significance of eye contact vary widely between cultures, with religious and social differences often altering its meaning greatly.\nEye contact and facial expressions give social and emotional information. People, perhaps without consciously doing so, probe each other's eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs. Sometimes, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions.\nEye contact is also an important element in flirting, where it may serve to establish and gauge the other's interest in some situations.\nDifferent societies.\nIn traditional societies, the role of women is usually very different from men. So, women lower their eyes, and do not to look directly at a man's face. Lustful glances at the opposite sex, young or adult, are forbidden. \nAnother social difference is that of status. Japanese children are taught in school to direct their gaze at the region of their teacher's Adam's apple or tie knot. As adults, Japanese lower their eyes when speaking to a superior as a gesture of respect.\nIn many cultures, such as East Asia and Nigeria, it is respectful not to look the dominant person in the eye, but in Western culture this can be interpreted as being \"shifty-eyed\", or untrustworthy."}

The difference is how the legislature gets its power. The legislature is not chosen by a ruler or by birth. The peoples choose the legislature in an election. This means that the executives get their power from the legislature, but the legislature gets its power from the people.\nHow it works.\nThe people choose the legislature. There are many people in the legislature. That group then gets together to choose one person to be their leader. The leader is often part of the legislature. The name for this job is Prime Minister in most countries. The Prime Minister is the head of government. This person leads the country. This way, the people are the power behind the parliamentary republic. They choose the units that make government work. \nThis is different from other parliamentary systems because the legislature is chosen in a different way. In other parliamentary systems, members are chosen by the head of state, the local leaders, or by birth. In a parliamentary republic, the people choose the members. The people do this through elections. Sometimes they vote for every person in parliament. Other times they vote for people in their area. The politicians they elect go to parliament to make laws and select the head of state. This gives the people power to decide who is in government. "}

One of the highest-paid Indian celebrities, she has established a career in Bollywood films, and is the recipient of two Filmfare Awards. She is married to ranveer singh (2018 till date). She belongs to OBC caste.\nEarly life.\nDeepika Padukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen, Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents. Her father, Prakash, is a former badminton player of international repute, and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent. Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer. Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association. The family relocated to Bangalore, India, when Padukone was a year old. She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School, and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College. She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology, but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career.\nCareer.\nPadukone's first screen appearance was in Himesh Reshammiya's music video \"Naam Hai Tera\" in 2005. Padukone made her film debut by playing the titular protagonist in the Kannada film \"Aishwarya\" (2006). Her first Hindi film release came the following year with Farah Khan's melodrama \"Om Shanti Om\", in which she played dual roles opposite Shah Rukh Khan. For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and also received a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. Her sole film role in 2008 was as one of Ranbir Kapoor's love interests in \"Bachna Ae Haseeno\".\nPadukone's first film release of 2009, the kung fu comedy \"Chandni Chowk to China\" opposite Akshay Kumar, proved to be a box office flop. However, her next release, Imtiaz Ali's romance \"Love Aaj Kal\" grossed worldwide, and garnered her a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Padukone had five film releases in 2010. The comedy \"Housefull\" was a commercial success, though her other four releases that year failed at the box office. The series of poorly received films continued with both her 2011 releases, the drama \"Aarakshan\" and the comedy \"Desi Boyz\".\nThe role of an impulsive party-girl in Homi Adajania's \"Cocktail\" (2012) proved to be a breakthrough for Padukone. Critics praised her performance and she received several acting nominations for it. The year 2013 was key for Padukone; three of her four releases that year earned over in India. Among these were two of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all timethe romantic comedy \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" and the action-comedy \"Chennai Express\". She also won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for portraying Leela, a character based on Juliet, in \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" (2013). In 2014, Padukone appeared in \"Kochadaiiyaan\", an animation film in Tamil, which was shot using motion capture technology. Also that year, she played a young widow in Adajania's \"Finding Fanny\" and a bar dancer in the ensemble heist film \"Happy New Year\". The following year, Padukone starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Irrfan Khan in Shoojit Sircar's critically acclaimed comedy-drama \"Piku\" (2015).\nReferences.\nhttp://www.gosip4u.com/2020/01/deepika-padukon-chapaak.html"}

He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Oxford. He was the MP for North Devon from 1959 until 1979. He was leader of his party from 1967 until 1976.\nIn 1979 at the Central Criminal Court in London, Thorpe was acquitted of conspiracy to murder model Norman Scott.\nThe Scott affair.\nIn 1961, Norman Scott (b. 12 February 1940), a former model, met Thorpe while working as a stable lad. He claimed that he and Thorpe had a sexual relationship between 1961 and 1963, when homosexual acts were illegal in Britain.\nEnquiries led to Thorpe and three others being charged with conspiracy to murder Scott. During the investigation, an antique firearms collector, Dennis Meighan, confessed he had been hired by a representative of a person called \"a Mr Big in the Liberal Party\" to kill Scott for \u00a313,500. Meighan later claimed that his 1975 oral confession was significantly shortened when it was offered to him for signing: \"I read the statement, which did me no end of favours, but it did Jeremy Thorpe no end of favours as well, because it left him completely out of it...\" \nThe judge's summing-up was widely criticised for its bias, and it made headlines when he described Scott as \"a crook, an accomplished liar ... a fraud\". The four defendants were all acquitted on 22 June 1979. Dennis Meighan was never called to give evidence and remained silent until 2014, when he acknowledged his involvement and commented: \"It was a cover-up, no question, but it suited me fine\".\nThe Scott Affair ruined Thorpe, who resigned as leader of the Liberal Party, and was defeated at the next general election in 1979.\nPersonal life.\nThorpe was married to Caroline Allpass from 1968 until she was killed in a car crash in 1970. The couple's son was born in 1969. Thorpe was married to pianist Marion Stein (1926-2014) from 1973 until her death. Thorpe was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He died from the disease in London on 4 December 2014, aged 85."}
