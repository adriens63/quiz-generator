The parts of the jaw structure are connected by ligaments and muscles. The jaw parts are very small, ranging from 4 \u03bcm to 14 \u03bcm. The animal can extend part of its jaw structure outside of its mouth while eating. It also extends much of its jaw structure outside of its mouth when it is regurgitating (pushing out) items that are indigestible.\n\"L. maerski\" has a large ganglion, or 'brain', in its head. Paired nerve cords go along the lower side of the body) to the tail. Stiff sensory bristles made up of one to three cilia are scattered about the body. These bristles are similar to those on gnathostomulids.\nFlexible cilia are arranged in a horseshoe-shaped area on the forehead, and in spots on the sides of the head and in two rows on the underside of the body. The cilia on the forehead create a current that moves food particles towards the mouth. The other cilia move the animal.\nAll specimens of \"L. maerski\" that have been collected have had female organs. They lay two kinds of eggs: thin-walled eggs that hatch quickly, and thick-walled eggs that are believed to be resistant to freezing, and thus capable of over-wintering and hatching in the spring. The same pattern is known from rotifers, where thick-walled eggs only form after fertilization by males. The youngest \"L. maerski\" specimens collected may also have male organs: it is now thought that the animals hatch as males and then become females.\nPhylogeny.\nCladogram (adapted from ) showing the relationships of \"Limnognathia\":"}

Sometimes they are captured and domesticated. Most are then used as working horses on farms or stations. Some may be used as riding horses or show horses.\nBrumbies are regarded as pests by environmentalists and the government. They are considered a threat to native ecosystems. There are several programmes to eradicate (kill) all feral horses across Australia. However, there are also many people working to stop this, as brumbies are also valued by many as part of Australia's history. The Brumby also might get its name from James Brumby, a horse breeder."}

An iOS version was released on December 13, 2012. The iOS version was released as an alternative to Apple's built-in maps application, which was released with iOS 6.\nGoogle Maps has many features, including turn-by-turn navigation, street view, and public transit information. The application's user interface was completely redesigned. The original version did not support the iPad, but Google added iPad support with version 2.0.\nBackground.\nThe built-in maps application on iOS used Google Maps until iOS 6. With the release of the first iOS 6 beta in June 2012, Apple announced that they had created their own map service. iOS 6 was released on September 19, 2012 with a new maps application that uses map data by Apple. Google decided to create its own maps application after Apple's built-in maps application was criticized a lot.\nRelease.\nGoogle Maps was launched on the iOS App Store on December 13, 2012. After only two days, the application had been downloaded over 10 million times. It was initially reported shortly after the application was released that the number of iOS upgrades to iOS 6 increased by as much as 30%. Later reports suggested that the increase was actually because of the iPhone\u00a05's release in China.\nReception.\nThe application has had mostly favorable reviews from critics. USA Today said, \"The reemergence in the middle of the night of a Google Maps app for the iPhone is like the return of an old friend. Only your friend, who\u2019d gone missing for three months, comes back looking better than ever.\" CNET, called it \"the king of maps\" and said, \"With its iOS Maps app, Google sets the standard for what mobile navigation should be and more.\" Bree Fowler of the Associated Press compared Google's and Apple's map applications. He said, \"The one clear advantage that Apple has is style. Like Apple devices, the maps are clean and clear and have a fun, pretty element to them, especially in 3-D. But when it comes down to depth and information, Google still reigns superior and will no doubt be welcomed back by its fans.\" Gizmodo gave it a \"gizrank\" of 4.5 stars. in 2013 Google even admitted that the iPhone and iPod touch version of its mapping software was more advanced than the version on its own Android mobile phone and tablet operating system."}

The energy sector based on the large reserves of crude oil and natural gas, is the main source of economic growth in Azerbaijan today, though half of the Azerbaijani people earn their income directly or indirectly through services and a third earn their income through agriculture. The energy boom has led to massive foreign direct investment and the growth rate of the Azerbaijani economy is one of the world's highest.\nAfter gaining independence in 1991 with the end of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan made the long and difficult change from a command economy to a market economy. The government has largely completed privatization of agricultural lands and small, medium and large stateowned companies. Azerbaijan is continuing making economic reforms, and old economic ties and structures have been slowly replaced. With independence, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Azerbaijan's currency is the Azerbaijani manat (AZN) which is divided into 100 q\u0259pik. It became the national currency in 1992 and replaced the old Soviet ruble. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan was created in 1992. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, and is responsible for printing and distributing the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to control all commercial banks.\nIndustry.\nAzerbaijan is rich in natural resources which provide energy, especially in crude oil and natural gas, and hydroelectricity and wind power. Other natural resources include minerals such as gold, silver, iron, copper, titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, complex ore and antimony which are mined. Crude oil and natural gas, are the most important products of Azerbaijan's economy and the main sources of export contributing to its economic growth. They are also the basis for an widespread system of refineries, which produce gasoline, herbicides, fertilizers, kerosene, synthetic rubber, and plastics. The oil and natural gas are carried through pipelines from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk in Russia and Suspa in Georgia and to the Mediterranean Sea port Ceyhan in Turkey. Hydroelectric power plants supply 20% of the country's electric capacity and wind power production is slowly increasing. Other major industries include cement, fertiliser, steel, chemicals, automobiles, and machinery.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture is a small part of the economy which contributes only 6% of the GDP of Azerbaijan but employs 38.3% of the workforce. 21.78% of the total land area is arable land (land where crops can be cultivated (grown)) and 2.1% are used for permanent crops (crops which last for many seasons, rather than being replanted after each harvest). 16.45% of the total land area, which makes up the majority of Azerbaijan's cultivated lands, is irrigated. The major crops for are agricultural cash crops, grapes,cotton, tobacco, citrus fruits, rice, tea and vegetables. Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products. Farms in Azerbaijan are organized as state and cooperative farms which employ many farmers, and small private farms which are owned and run by one farmer and his/her family. A leading caviar producer and exporter in the past, Azerbaijan's fishing industry today is concentrated on the dwindling supply of sturgeon and beluga in the Caspian Sea.\nTourism.\nTourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s, yet, after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination. It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays. In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism. During winter, the ski resorts such as Shahdag Winter Complex are popular with foreign visitors."}

{"id": "409652", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=409652", "title": "Glossary of dance figures", "text": "Dance figures are groups of steps which have a name, and are described in technical dance manuals. Dance steps are the individual movements in a dance. A step is usually a change of weight from one leg to the other. Dance patterns and dance movements are informal terms.\nGlossary.\nBasic movement.\nThe basic movement (also called the basic figure or the basic step) is the most basic movement of a dance. The music and the basic figures form the character of a dance. It is enough to do the basic steps in time with the music to dance socially. \nHowever, most social dancers can do a few more figures: one does need to turn corners. So, for example, in the waltz a social dancer would need as a minimum: Closed change figures going forward and backward; natural turn to the right; reverse turn to the left. Next would come the whisk and chass\u00e9 (see below).\nBox step.\nThe box step is a dance figure named so because the steps are made in the four corners of a square. It is used in some American-style ballroom dances (Rumba, Waltz).\nChass\u00e9.\nChass\u00e9 (or chasse: the last 'e' is pronounced) is a dance figure with three steps. It is a smooth, flowing figure, with the feet moving sideways to the body in a step-together-step pattern. Originally used in the quickstep and the English Waltz (International waltz).\nClosed change.\nClosed change is a basic figure in the Waltz. The man steps forward on either foot whilst the lady steps backward on the opposing foot. They will then step to the side on the other foot, and finish the figure by closing the first foot beside the second. Each step takes up a full beat of the music.\nContra body movement position.\nContra body movement position or CBMP is when the body is held at a different angle to the feet. It applies to almost every step taken outside partner, so it occurs often in tango and in \"all\" promenade figures.\nDosado.\nDosado is a circular movement where two people, who are initially facing each other, walk around each other without or almost without turning. They face in the same direction all the time they are moving. They do not turn to face each other.\nFeather step.\nThe feather step is a basic figure in the Foxtrot. The man makes three steps forward, with the third one (right foot) done outside the lady. Second and third steps taken with left shoulder leading.\nFigure.\n\"A completed set of steps\" More explicitly: a small sequence of steps comprising a meaningful gestalt, and given a name, for example 'whisk' or 'spin turn'.\nFrame.\nThe frame is a fundamental concept in ballroom dancing. The standard hold for partners differs according to the type of dance. In ballroom it is of critical importance, since it affects the ability of the two people to move as one. \nIn a close hold in ballroom the partners are slightly offset, with the lady (or 'follower') slightly to the right side of the man. Therefore their feet are not exactly opposite each other. The lady's shape in advanced dancers is as follows. With her hips firmly against the man, the top half of her body is slightly back and to the left. \nIn the tango the lady is further to the right of the man, to half the width of the body. The dance is done with a right side lead by the man, and with no rise of the feet. Placing of the feet is delayed to the last possible moment, creating a movement in character with the music.\nThe other aspect of the frame is the arms. The position of the man's arms should not vary in the course of a dance in ballroom (in relation to his shoulders). Advanced dancers hold the frame wider and higher than social dancers.\nIn latin dances the partners are said to be in closed hold if they have their hands on each other, if not they are in semi-open or open positions. Most social latin dance is done in closed hold; most competition dancing is done in open position.\nHeel turn.\nThe heel turn is a ballroom dance move. The heel of the support foot is turned while the other foot is held close and parallel to the support one. At the end of the turn the weight is transferred from one foot to another. A different version of this is the heel pull, in which the feet are kept apart.\nHockey stick.\nA hockey stick is a figure in the Latin ballroom dances Rumba and Cha-cha-cha. This move gets its name because the lady moves in a pattern that is similar to a hockey stick.\nKick.\nA kick is a movement of the foot and the lower part of the leg. It may vary from a light flick to a full kick of the knee.\nLock Step.\nA lock step is an action where the moving foot swings behind the standing foot rather than closing next to it. It is an elementary figure in the quickstep, and is now danced in all the ballroom dances. \nGoing forward, the right foot ends up to the left of the left foot and somewhat behind it. Going backwards, the left foot ends up to the right of the right foot and slightly in front of it.\nDancing this figure, the body is held diagonally to the direction of movement. This is an outside partner figure taken in contra-body movement position (CBMP).\nIn latin dances other versions of the lock step are done.\nMoonwalk.\nThe moonwalk is a dance technique that presents the illusion of the dancer being pulled backwards while trying to walk forward.\nNatural and reverse turns.\nA natural turn is a turn in which the dance couple rotates to the right (clockwise). A reverse turn is when the couple rotates to the left (anti-clockwise).\nOpen turn or figure.\nA ballroom dance figure in which the moving foot passes the supporting foot, rather than closes to it.\nOutside partner steps.\nAn outside partner step is a step taken with the partner beside the moving foot. During this step the feet tracks of both partners do not overlap.\nPromenade position.\nPromenade position (PP) is when the couple is positioned for their inside feet (man's left foot, lady's right foot) to move across to the man's left. It occurs in the elementary waltz figure of whisk and chass\u00e9. In dancing this figure correctly, the bodies form a thin v-shape. As they move into the chass\u00e9, their feet will point more towards the direction of movement. This effect, rarely achieved by elementary dancers, is caused by the contra body movement position (CBMP). \nAbout half the tango figures are danced in PP.\nWalk.\nThe walk is probably the most basic dance step. It is used in almost every dance. Walks roughly correspond to normal walking steps, but are a bit different depending on the basic technique of the dance. For example, with walks in Latin dance, the ball of the foot touches the floor first, rather than the heel. In basic latin dances, the ball of the feet should never leave the floor. With few exceptions, heel leads are not used."}

It contributes only 6% of the GDP of the country, but employs 38.3% of the workforce. 21.78% of the total land area is arable land (land where crops can be cultivated (grown)) and 2.1% are used for permanent crops (crops which last for many seasons, rather than being replanted after each harvest). 16.45% of the total land area, which makes up the majority of Azerbaijan's cultivated lands, is irrigated. The major crops for are agricultural cash crops, grapes,cotton, tobacco, citrus fruits, rice, tea and vegetables. Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products. Farms in Azerbaijan are organized as state and cooperative farms which employ many farmers, and small private farms which are owned and run by one farmer and his/her family. A leading caviar producer and exporter in the past, Azerbaijan's fishing industry today is concentrated on the dwindling supply of sturgeon and beluga in the Caspian Sea.\nUnder the Soviet Union, agriculture in Azerbaijan was collectivized in large state farms. Collectivization meant taking the land from owners of all farms and joining it into large farms run by the government. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, economic reforms took place, which led to the rapid changes in the agricultural sector as well, including privatization. After the \"Law on Land Reforms\" was passed in 1996, land has been given to individuals who are now allowed to own small private farms and sell their farm products. Nevertheless, Azerbaijan's agricultural sector still needs a lot of modernization, if it is to realize its vast potential. Prices for agricultural products are below the cost of labor, because the Soviet-era communist collective farm system discouraged private initiative; equipment in general and the irrigation system in particular are old, and modern technology is still not widespread, especially in small private farms."}

The practice was widely used in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. People stopped using it in the 19th century. The idea of bloodletting comes from an ancient system of medicine called Humorism: This system states, that there are different \"humors\" in the body. To remain healthy, a patient had to keep these humours in balance. Bloodletting was the most common medical practice performed by physicians from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years.\nIt was found that only in very few cases, this treatment helps cure a disease. The practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific conditions. There was no other treatment for hypertension. Bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume. The problem with hypertension is that it is difficult to diagonse from its symptoms. Modern methods directly measure blood pressure. In Antiquity, this effect was therefore unintentional. In most cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients.\nThe diseases where bloodletting actually helps include Polycythemia vera. In this disease, the number of red blood cells is increased, which changes the viscosity of the blood. Another disease is Polycythemia, which also leads to an increased number of red blood cells."}

The International Blind Sports Association (IBSA) says B2 athletes are: \"From ability to recognise the shape of a hand to a visual acuity of 2/60 and/or visual field of less than 5 degrees.\" The Canadian Paralympic Committee says B2 athletes havve \"Up to approximately 3-5% functional vision.\" B2 is used in other sports other than sports run by the IBSA. Other sports using B2 are blind golf. Blind golf rules say B2 golfers include \"From ability to recognise the shape of a hand up to visual acuity of 2/60 or visual field of less than 5 degrees\".\nB2 is equal to other disability classifications for other sports. In adaptive rowing, the similar B2 class is LTA-B2. In horse riding, Grade 4 is the similar group to B2. For swimming, the similar disability group for B2 is S12.\nHistory.\nB2 has its history in the early history of blind sports. When blind people first started competing, people believed people who had better vision could unfairly compete against people with worse vision. Different groups around vision problem were developed by the IBSA to make playing sport more fair for people with different levels of blindness.\nThe IBSA B2 is mostly the same since it was created, even as the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) changed methods to allow people to fairly compete against each other based on functional ability.\nEquipment.\nEquipment used by B2 sportspeople may include sighted guides, guide rails, beeping balls and clap sticks. The use of a sighted guide by B2 athletes depends on the sport. For blind archery, B2 sportspeople use a sighting device based on the sense of touch and must not be able to see well enough to use a bowsight."}

The area corresponds approximately to the modern French \"d\u00e9partement\" of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales.\nThe French name, \"Catalogne Nord\", is used nowadays, although less often than the more politically neutral Roussillon (in reference to the pre-Revolutionary province). Sometimes French Catalonia is also used.\nGeography.\nNorthern Catalonia forms a triangle between the Pyrenees to the south, the Corbi\u00e8res to the north-west and the Mediterranean Sea to the east. The Plain of Roussillon in the east, by far the area where more people live, is formed by the floodplains of the Tech, T\u00eat and Agly rivers (). The districts of Vallespir and Conflent cover the upper valleys of the Tech and the T\u00eat respectively. The mountain Le Canigou (), , dominates much of the territory.\nThe climate is of the Mediterranean type, with hot, dry summers and winters which are relatively mild, at least on the Roussillon plain where snow is rare.\nMore of a quarter of the population of Northern Catalonia is in the city of Perpignan (). Perpignan is the only important administrative and service centre. Roads and trains run north\u2013south through Northern Catalonia between France and Spain.\nLanguages.\nFrench is the only official language in France as whole and in these municipalities. Catalan, in its Northern Catalan variety, is recognized as a regional language only by the region of Languedoc-Roussilon. It is estimated to be spoken by a quarter of the population, but understood by a higher percentage.\nIn 1700, the government of Louis XIV prohibited the use of the Catalan language in official documents.\nIn the 1950s, after centuries of being forbidden in education, the Catalan language was permitted to be studied for one hour per week in secondary school. In the 1970s, the Arrels Association and Bressola network of private schools started to offer complete bilingual French/Catalan classes from nursery up to secondary education.\nOn December 10, 2007, the General Council of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales recognized Catalan as one of the languages of the department, alongside French and Occitan (in Fenouill\u00e8des), with the goal to further promote it in public life and education."}

The scientific argument behind this claim is known as the Shakespeare authorship question. \"Anti-Stratfordians\" say Shakespeare of Stratford was a false name to shield the identity of the real author or authors. These authors did not want their real names to become public, for various resons. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and for the most part acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.\nShakespeare's authorship was first questioned in the middle of the 19th century. At that time the idea that Shakespeare was the greatest writer of all time had become widespread. Shakespeare had a simple background, and some details of his life are unknown. These facts seemed to be incompatible with his poetic eminence and his reputation for genius. Some people suspected that Shakespeare might not have written the works attributed to him. The controversy has since spawned a vast body of literature, and 80 authorship candidates have been proposed, including Francis Bacon, the 6th Earl of Derby, Christopher Marlowe, and the 17th Earl of Oxford.\nSome Anti-Stratfordians say William Shakespeare lacked the education, aristocratic sensibility, or familiarity with the royal court. They also say that these characteristics can be found in his works. Those Shakespeare scholars who have responded to such claims hold that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship, and that the convergence of documentary evidence used to support Shakespeare's authorship\u2014title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records\u2014is the same used for all other authorial attributions of his era. No such direct evidence exists for any other candidate, and Shakespeare's authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death.\nDespite the scholarly consensus, a relatively small but highly visible and diverse assortment of supporters, including prominent public figures, have questioned the conventional attribution. They work for acknowledgment of the authorship question as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry and for acceptance of one or another of the various authorship candidates."}

It affects the brain and nervous system a lot like alcohol, but goes away when the diver rises to a shallower depth. It does not have lasting effects after the depth is reduced.\nWho can get it.\nAny underwater diver who goes deeper than 30 m (100 ft)while breathing air, or any time when the pressure of nitrogen in the breathing gas is more than about 3,2 bar.\nHow to prevent it.\nIt only happens when the pressure of nitrogen is high. If the pressure is kept low by staying at a shallower depth it will not happen. If the breathing gas has less nitrogen it will only start at a deeper depth. Helium gas can be used in place of nitrogen in breathing gas for divers to make it less likely to have nitrogen narcosis.\nWhat actually happens.\nThe nitrogen gas dissolved in the diver affects the working of nerve cells. At higher pressures more nitrogen can be dissolved.\nIt starts off as a mild effect like being slightly drunk, but as the pressure increases it gets more serious, like getting more drunk. Eventually the diver may lose consciousness.\nWhy is it a problem.\nA diver who has nitrogen narcosis will have slower reactions and may not think clearly. If something goes wrong the diver may not be able to cope with the problem. This can be dangerous.\nWhat to do about it.\nThe diver can move to a shallower depth or change to a different breathing gas with less nitrogen. This will usually be a mixture containing helium."}

It is used, for example, in printers. They are also commonly found in robots, automotive devices, and computer hard drives. Like other electric motors, they need an electrical circuit to work. Typically they have more than two wires to control them. There are several versions of stepper motors and several ways to drive them.\nDC motors can be considered using two general categories, stepper motors and servo motors.\nServo motors needs a continuous feedback of position to control the state of the motor in order to give the motor specific or desired speed or position. These types of stepper motor are usually more expensive because they required additional circuitry to acquire this constant positional feedback.\nThe other type of generalized motor is called a stepper motor. This stepper motor is commonly used for simple experiments because it is inexpensive. It doesn't require the position of the motor to be known, hence it won't require additional circuitry. A stepper motor turns to a specific positions in using a constant sequence. This sequence can be achieved in multiple ways.\nFull stepping, half stepping, and micro stepping are ways to achieve a sequence of steps from the motor. \nFull stepping with a two phase motor calls for two coils to be alternated simultaneously. This form of stepping will allow the motor to spin, but the angle of that spin will be based upon the step angle. The step angle is equal to the 360 degrees divided by the steps per revolutions. The steps per revolutions are found by the number phases on the stator times the number of permanent magnets available to the motor. "}

For example, consider the word \"cout\" which is used by C++ to display outputs on the screen. The computer, however, does not know what \"cout\" is. So, it checks if \"cout\" exists in a dictionary file (i.e. the header file) that has been mentioned by the programmer.

{"id": "410236", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=410236", "title": "Oceanic whitetip shark", "text": "The oceanic whitetip shark (\"Carcharhinus longimanus\"), is a large species of requiem shark, in the genus \"Carcharhinus\". The oceanic whitetip reef shark reaches a maximum length of four metres, and can weigh as much as 170 kg (370 pounds). This species of shark can be distinguished by its large, rounded first dorsal fin, and its long, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins.\nThe oceanic whitetip shark should not be confused with the whitetip reef shark.\nDescription.\nThe oceanic whitetip shark is easy to distinguish. It has a large, rounded first dorsal fin, and very long, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is very large with a rounded tip, and is just in front of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is located over, or slightly in front of, the anal fin. This species has a whitish-tipped first dorsal, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and caudal fin. The underside of the body is white, with a yellow tinge on some individuals. \nOceanic whitetip sharks can grow to large sizes, with the largest individuals reaching 3.5-4 metres (12-13 feet) in length. However, most specimens are less than 3 metres (10 feet) in length. The maximum recorded weight for this species is 170 kg (370 pounds). Males mature at 1.7-1.9 metres (5.6-6.2 feet) in length, while females reach maturity at slightly longer sizes of 1.8-2 metres (5.9-6.6 feet). \nHabitat.\nIn the western Atlantic, the oceanic whitetip shark is found from Maine, U.S.A to Argentina, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. In the eastern Atlantic it is found from Portugal to the Gulf of Guinea, possibly occurring in the Mediterranean. In the Indo-Pacific, it is found from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Hawaiian, Samoan, Tahiti and Tuamoto islands. In the eastern Pacific it ranges from southern California to Peru, including the Galapagos Islands. \nThis shark is usually seen well offshore in deep water areas up to the depth of 152 metres (500 feet). On occasion it has been seen in shallower waters near land, usually near oceanic islands. Captured data in the Pacific Ocean shows that the abundance of this shark increases along with the distance from land. It is one of the top three most abundant oceanic sharks, with the blue shark and the silky shark.\nAlthough this shark is mainly solitary, the oceanic whitetip shark gathers in groups when food is present. It is a slow swimmer, with equal amount of activity during the day and night. Reports show that the oceanic whitetip shark is usually found near the surface, swimming slowly with its pectoral fins spread widely. Oceanic whitetip sharks are often accompanied by remoras, dolphinfish, and pilot fish. An unusual behaviour was once observed in Hawaiian waters. The oceanic whitetip sharks were shown swimming along with pods of shortfin pilot whales. This behaviour was not fully understood, but was thought to be food-related. The oceanic whitetip sharks were thought to have been swimming with the pilot whales because the pilot whales were better at finding squid which the sharks also eat.\nBehaviour.\nThe oceanic whitetip shark is mainly solitary and swims slowly, and is usually seen cruising near the top of the water column, covering large amounts of empty water, searching for prey or any food source. Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as \"sea dogs\". The oceanic whitetip shark, the most common ship-following shark, shows dog-like behaviour when it is attracted by something which appears to be food. It starts swimming greedily towards the food source, approaches cautiously but stubbornly. It keeps a safe distance if driven off, but is ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself. Oceanic whitetip sharks are not fast swimmers, but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed. They commonly compete for food with silky sharks, often presenting aggressive displays. There does not seem to be segregation by gender and size. Oceanic whitetip sharks usually follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey.\nFeeding.\nThe oceanic whitetip shark feeds mainly on bony fish, including lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, mackerels, and threadfins. Other prey consists of stingrays, sea turtles, sea birds, gastropods, squid, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion (dead whales and dolphins). Feeding behaviour has been reported for this shark and includes biting into schools of bony fish. It also swims through schools of feeding tuna with wide-open jaws, into which the tuna unknowingly swim. The oceanic whitetip shark has also been observed eating garbage that is disposed of at sea. If other species of sharks are encountered by the oceanic whitetip shark during feeding activities, the whitetip becomes aggressive and dominates over them. \nReproduction.\nIn the north-western Atlantic and the south-western Indian Ocean, the oceanic whitetip shark has been known to mate during the early summer. After a gestation period lasting around 1 year, the females give birth to around 1-15 pups. The oceanic whitetip shark is viviparous, and both genders reach maturity around the ages of 6-7 years, with the females being at a length of 1.8-2 metres (5.9-6.6 feet), and the males being at a length of 1.7-1.9 metres (5.6-6.2 feet). The young are around 60-65 cm long at birth. \nHuman interactions.\nOceanic whitetip sharks are usually caught by shark fisheries. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, smoked, and dried-salted for human consumption, the skin is used for leather, the fins used in shark-fin soup, and the liver oil is used for vitamins. It is also processed into fishmeals. Tuna fishermen dislike the oceanic whitetip shark as it has been known to follow tuna boats and damage or consume catches. Although this species is usually seen offshore, it is considered to be dangerous. It is usually the first species to be seen in waters surrounding mid-ocean disasters. During World War II, the \"Nova Scotia\", a steamship, was sunk by torpedoes from a German submarine off the coast of South Africa. Close to 1,000 men were on board, however only 192 survived. It was believed that many of the fatalities were victims of the oceanic whitetip shark in what eyewitness accounts described as a feeding frenzy. \nIn encounters with divers, ocean whitetip sharks have shown little fear, and usually investigate and circle around the ongoing activities. Due to this shark's opportunistic feeding habits and strong jaws, as well as its boldness and unpredictability around divers, this shark should be treated with extreme caution. Many attacks are caused when divers accidentally bump into the shark. \nAlthough this species is listed as 'vulnerable' overall, it has been listed as 'critically endangered' by the IUCN in the north-western and western-central Atlantic. This is due to the massive decline in reported catches indicating that the population has decreased. "}

It's capital was the city of Le Mans. The area is now divided into the departments of Sarthe and Mayenne.\nHistory.\nThe Carolingians called Maine \"pagis cenomannicus\" after the Cenomani tribe that Julius Caesar had defeated. Pepin the Short gave the duchy of Maine to his half-brother Grifo.\nIn the last half of the 9th century, Maine took on greater importance because of invasions from Normandy and Brittany. In 924 King Rudolph of France gave Maine to Rollo of Normandy. Because it was next to Anjou on the south and Normandy on the north, these two duchies often fought over Maine.\nWilliam, Duke of Normandy invaded Maine in 1063 and he controlled the county by the beginning of 1064. Norman control of Maine helped make the southern border of Normandy safe against Anjou. This was a factor which allowed Duke William to launch his successful invasion of England in 1066.\nIn 1069 the citizens of Le Mans revolted against the Normans. Soon some of the Manceaux barons joined the revolt. The Normans were expelled in 1070, and young Hugh V was made the Count of Maine. After Norman attacks in 1073, 1088, 1098 and 1099, Elias I succeeded his cousin Hugh V, who sold Maine to him in 1092 for ten thousand shillings. His daughter married Fulk V, Count of Anjou, who took Maine over in 1110 after the death of Elias. Henri Beauclerc, agreed to recognize him as Count of Maine.\nFulk's son Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou inherited Maine. In 1051 it passed to Geoffrey's son Henry, Duke of Normandy (later King Henry I of England). Anjou, Maine and Normandy now had the same ruler for the first time. Henry later founded the Plantagenet dynasty in England.\nThe King of France, Philippe Auguste attacked the Plantagenet holdings called the Angevin Empire when it was held by John, King of England. In 1331 the Count of Maine became a peer of the realm.\nAfter the battle of Verneuil in 1424, the English occupied Maine. They held Le Mans until 1448 and Fresnay until 1449. In 1481, Charles V of Anjou left his lands to Louis IX of France. This act returned the county to the crown of France."}

It was written by Okakura Kakuz\u014d, and was published in 1906.\nThe book is written for a Western audience. It was originally written in English. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was good at communicating his thoughts to Westerners. In his book, he discusses Zen and Taoism, but also the secular (non-religious) aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism (the art of tea) taught the Japanese many things. Most importantly it taught them simplicity. Kakuz\u014d says that this simplicity, inspired by tea, affected arts and architecture.\nTeaism.\nWhen tea is more than a drink and the tea ceremony is understood and practiced to foster harmony in humanity, promote harmony with nature, discipline the mind, quiet the heart, and attain the purity of enlightenment, the art of tea becomes teaism. And it can be used to describe tea ceremony as the interests in tea culture and studies and pursued over time with self-cultivation. Teaism is mostly a simplistic mode of aesthetics, but there are subtle insights into ethics, and even metaphysics. Teaism is related to teamind. A sense of focus and concentration while under the influence of great tasting tea. Teaist is a person who performs or enjoys the art of tea and teaism. In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cultures, they all have well-developed teaism.\nHistory.\nTeaism is a synthesis of Taoism, Zennism, and tea. It is likely that it alludes more to the Taoist influences on Zen, and subsequently the Chado, or the Japanese tea ceremony, as he makes the statement, 'A subtle philosophy lay behind it all. Teaism was Taoism in disguise.' Teaism is brought out for its Taoist origins; but in the second half, it is shown through its manifestations in the Chado and in Japanese culture in general.\nTerminology of dao/do with respect to tea.\nIn this sense tea is more than a drink and more than an art, it is integrated in the culture and the mind. The term Chinese:chadao or Japanese:chado in English is a difficult translation task. In most common use and easy to express translation is \"tea ceremony\". A direct translation is \"the way of tea\" or \"the way of tea\". The term \"teaism\" is by some only signifies this with Japanese tea ceremony. Similar terms are \"tea arts\" and \"tea culture\". While the word lore is usually not used in this context, another term used is tea lore."}

It can handle high current at reverse bias too which is not expected from a normal diode.\nProperties.\nAll other properties of Zener diode are similar to that of a normal p-n junction diode.\nUses.\nZener diode is used as a voltage regulator. That means it can fix the output voltage to a constant value for long time. In this purpose a Zener diode regulator circuit is used at the output of diode rectifier circuit."}

He was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to fill a vacancy in the Senate. He later became the first Indigenous Australian to be elected to the parliament. Bonner was an elder of the Jagera people.\nBiography.\nBonner was born on Ukerebagh Island, in the Tweed River in northern New South Wales. He never knew his father and had very little education. He worked on a farm, and in 1946 moved to Palm Island, near Townsville, Queensland. He became Assistant Settlement Overseer.\nIn 1960, he moved to Ipswich, and joined the board of directors of the One People of Australia League (OPAL). This was an indigenous rights organisation. He became its Queensland president in 1970. He joined the Liberal Party in 1967 and held local office in the party. Following the resignation of Liberal Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin in 1971, Bonner was chosen to replace her. He became the first indigenous Australian to sit in the Australian Parliament. He was elected in his own right in 1972, 1974, 1975 and 1980.\nWhile in the Senate he served on a number of committees. He was never a serious candidate for promotion to the ministry. He rebelled against the Liberal Party policy on some issues. Partly as a result of this, and partly due to pressure from younger candidates, he was dropped from the Liberal Senate ticket at the 1983 election. He stood as an independent and was nearly successful. The Hawke government made him a director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nBonner was almost unique in being both an indigenous activist and a political conservative. He owed his political career to this combination. Other indigenous activists treated him badly, and they accused him of being a \"token\" in the Liberal Party.\nIn 1979, Bonner was jointly named Australian of the Year along with naturalist Harry Butler. In 1984, Bonner was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. From 1992 to 1996, he was member of the Griffith University Council. The university gave him an honorary doctorate in 1993. In 1998, he was elected to the Constitutional Convention as a candidate of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy. \nHe died in Ipswich in 1999, at the age 76.\nPosthumous honours.\nThe Neville Bonner Memorial Scholarship was set up by the Australian government in 2000. It gives money so that Indigenous Australians can study politics or related subjects at Australian universities.\nThe Queensland federal electorate of Bonner is named in his honour. A rugby league oval in Ipswich was named the Neville Bonner Sporting Complex in his honour. This oval was the home of an indigenous team, but is now the official home of the Queensland Cup team, the Ipswich Jets. The suburb of Bonner in Canberra, Australia's national capital, also bears his name. The head office of the Queensland Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services is named the \"Neville Bonner Building\".\nBonner was an active boomerang thrower. One of his boomerangs can be seen at the Old Parliament House in Canberra."}

She was the founding chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). She was named Australian of the Year in 1984.\nPersonal life.\nLowitja O'Donoghue was born at Granite Downs, a cattle station located on the Stuart Highway in northwest South Australia. Her father, Tom O'Donoghue, was a stockman of Irish descent. Her mother, Lily, was one of the native Yankunytjatjara people. Tom and Lily met while Tom was working at Everard Park, another cattle station on the traditional country of the Yankunytjatjara. The couple moved to Granite Downs, known as Indulkana to the Yankunytjatjara, in 1925. Lowitja was born here around 1 August 1932. She was the fifth of six children.\nIn 1934, members of the United Aborigines' Mission visited the community at Indulkana. They persuaded Lowitja's mother that it would be best for her children to be brought up by the missionaries. There was no school in Granite Downs, and they were concerned about raising their children in such an isolated location. They moved with their children to Oodnadatta, and took them to the mission, which was run by the Baptist Church. Lowitja was baptised at the mission by a pastor. She was taken to be taught at Colebrook Children's Home, an Aboriginal school run by the mission in Quorn. She began learning there at the age of three.\nLowitja was two years old when she was removed from her mother. After she was removed, she did not see her mother again for 33 years. During that time, her mother did not know where her children had been taken. Despite this, Lowitja did not identify as a member of the Stolen Generations. She would later say that she preferred the word \"removed\" over \"stolen\" for her personal case. She has said she was happy living at Colebrooke and that she received a good education both there and at the Quorn Primary School. However, it is these sort of assimilation practises by the Churches that Lowitja and many others would eventually work to put an end to.\nIn 1944, Colebrook Home moved to Eden Hills in the south of Adelaide due to very bad water shortages. This allowed Lowitja to go to Unley High School, a local public school.\nIn 1979, Lowitja married Gordon Smart, a health care worker at the Repatriation Hospital. She had first met him in 1964. He died in 1991, and was buried at Quorn.\nNursing career.\nFrom 1950 to 1953, O'Donoghue worked as a nursing aide in Victor Harbor. The small local hospital did not run a training course. With the help of the matron, Lowitja applied to be a student nurse in Adelaide. The Royal Adelaide Hospital originally rejected her, but shortly afterwards she was offered a position as a student nurse in 1954. She qualified as a nurse and worked at the Royal Adelaide Hospital until 1961.\nShe spent time as a nurse with the Baptist Church working in Assam, in northern India. She replaced missionaries who were taking leave back in Australia. Due to the nearby Sino-Indian War, she was advised by the Australian government to evacuate to Calcutta from where she returned to Australia.\nPublic service.\nAfter returning in 1962, she worked as an Aboriginal Liaison Officer with the South Australian Department of Education. She later transferred to the state's Department of Aboriginal Affairs. She worked there as a Welfare Officer based mainly in the north of the state, including at Coober Pedy.\nIn 1967, Lowitja joined the newly formed Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which was in charge of Aboriginal welfare across Australia. She worked in the department's Adelaide office. After eight years, she became the Director of the department's office in South Australia. She was responsible for implementing the national Aboriginal welfare policy in South Australia. After a short while, she left the public service.\nLowitja was a chairperson of the National Aboriginal Congress for a short time in the early 1980s. She was later appointed chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission. In 1990, she was appointed chairperson of the newly created Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). In 1991, she, along with Alf Bamblett and Steve Gordon, became the first Aboriginal people to attend a Cabinet meeting. In December 1992, she became the first Aboriginal Australian to address the United Nations General Assembly. She remained as chairperson of ATSIC until 1996. She was replaced by Gatjil Djerrkura, who was considered by the Howard Government to be more moderate.\nHonours and awards.\nIn 1976, O'Donoghue was the first Aboriginal woman to be inducted into the new Order of Australia. The award was in recognition of her work in welfare. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983. She was named Australian of the Year in 1984, for her work to improve the welfare of indigenous Australians. She was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1999. O'Donoghue was inducted into the Olympic Order in 2000. She was made Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II in 2005.\nO'Donoghue has received honorary doctorates from Murdoch University, the University of South Australia, the Australian National University, the Queensland University of Technology and Flinders University. She was made an honorary professorial fellow at Flinders University in 2000. "}

On 21 July 2019, Abdullahi Abbas was officially the first Nigerian who succeeded climbing to the top of the Canigou.Pablo Bucheli, together with his sherpa Abigail White, was the first Ecuadorian on the top of the mountain.\nGeography.\nCanigou is in the Regional Natural Park of the Catalan Pyrenees (; , often shortened as \"Parc del Pirineu Catal\u00e0\"), close to the eastern border of the park.\nThe Canigou peak is high. It is on a short mountain range, the Massif du Canigou, which is the eastern end of the Pyrenees. The mountain is the 395th highest mountain in France.\nHistory.\nThe first writings where the mountain is mentioned date from 949 with \"Montis Canigonis\" and \"Monte Canigone\" in Latin. The first written name of the mountain in Catalan (\"Canig\u00f3\") dates back to 1300, and from this comes \"Canigou\" in French.\nThe first ascent to Canigou was in 1285 by Peter III of Aragon, King of Aragon. This fact is mentioned in a chronicle written by Fra Salimbene, an Italian monk. It seems that the king did not go to the top of the peak.\nClimate.\nAlthough the dominant climate is largely Mediterranean at its base, the Canigou has several climate zones:\nAlthough variable from one year to the next, snow is generally continuous over , from mid-November to late May. The mean temperature in July is and in January is .\nCanigou Flame.\nThis mountain is a symbol for Catalan people. On its top there is a cross that is often decorated with the Catalan flag.\nEvery year on 23 June, the night before St. John's day (\"nit de Sant Joan\"), there is a ceremony called \"Flama del Canig\u00f3\" (Canigou Flame), where a fire is lit at the mountaintop. People spend the night there and take torches lit on that fire in a spectacular torch relay to light bonfires somewhere else. Some estimates conclude that about 30,000 bonfires are lit in this way all over Catalonia on that night.\nMassif du Canigou.\nThe \"Massif du Canigou\" is a mountain range in the Pyrenees in the French department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales. It is the part of the Pyrenees nearest to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThere are two old monasteries at the foot of the mountain, \"Martin-du-Canigou\" and \"Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa\".\nOn 16 July 2012, the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy of France named the \"Massif du Canigou\" as a Grand Site of France.\nThe main peaks of this mountain range are:"}

It has a very small network of embassies. Only Australia, France, New Zealand, and the People's Republic of China have embassies, high commissions, or missions in Port Vila. The British High Commission closed in 2005, after having been there for almost 100 years.\nThe government's main concern has been to improve the economy. It has a strong need for foreign aid, so Vanuatu has joined the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1980, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand have provided most of Vanuatu's development aid.\nVanuatu's foreign policy is fairly neutral. It stayed neutral during the Cold War, and has been a member of the Non-Aligned Movement since 1983. However, it has always given strong support for self-determination and decolonisation, especially throughout Melanesia. Vanuatu became independent from France and the United Kingdom in 1980. The first government recognised the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in November of the same year. It recognised the State of Palestine in August 1989. Later governments recognised Kosovo in 2010 and Abkhazia in 2011. Vanuatu has also supported the independence of New Caledonia and East Timor, and it strongly supports the Free Papua Movement in western New Guinea. Its relations with Indonesia have suffered because of this. Relations with Australia and New Zealand are a major focus of Vanuatu's foreign policy.\nVanuatu established diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1983, and Libya in 1986. It established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the United States in June and September 1986, respectively. Relations with the United States were bad until the late 1980s. Relations with France remained bad throughout the 1980s. Vanuatu under Walter Lini also tried to create strong relations with Asia. By the end of the 1980s, the country had established diplomatic relations with the China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nAustralia and Vanuatu have very strong ties. Australia has provided most of the assistance to Vanuatu's military. It is also Vanuatu's largest source of foreign investment, tourists, and foreign aid. Vanuatu also has strong ties to other Pacific countries. It is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, and several other regional organisations. It has been a member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie since 1979. It was admitted to the Commonwealth of Nations in 1980 and to the United Nations in 1981. Vanuatu is currently the only Pacific nation that belongs to the Non-Aligned Movement.\nBritish High Commissioners.\nList of British High Commissioners in Port Vila:"}

It is a strong source of patriotism. The two most popular sports in the Czech Republic are football and ice hockey. They both get the most attention from both the media and the public. The many other sports with professional teams in the Czech Republic include basketball, volleyball, handball, athletics, floorball and others.\nThe sporting events considered the most important in the Czech Republic are the Ice Hockey World Championships, the Olympic ice hockey tournament, the European football championship, and the football World Cup. In general, any international match involving the Czech national ice hockey or football team draws attention, especially when played against a traditional rival: Germany and Slovakia in football; and Russia, Finland, Sweden, Canada and Slovakia in ice hockey.\nTeam sports.\nIce hockey.\nThe Czech national ice hockey team is one of the most successful teams in the world. It regularly competes in the World Championships, the Olympic Games and the Euro Hockey Tour. The national team won their first Olympic Gold medal at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. The Czech team won six World Championship medals between 1996 to 2011. The highest-ranking ice hockey competition in the Czech Republic is the Extraliga. Famous Czech players include Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr, Dominik Ha\u0161ek, Patrik Eli\u00e1\u0161, Ale\u0161 Hemsk\u00fd, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Kaberle, Milan Mich\u00e1lek and Robert Lang.\nFootball.\nFootball has been a popular sport among Czechs for many years. Previously the old Czechoslovakia team were a strong team internationally. In 2006, the Czech national team qualified for their first World Cup since the break-up of Czechoslovokia. More recently players such as Petr \u010cech, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Rosick\u00fd and Pavel Nedv\u011bd have achieved great success at top European clubs and have become national icons.\nAmerican football.\nAmerican football began to be played in the Czech Republic from the 1980s. The Czech Association of American football (\"\") was created in 1994. Since then it has developed a league system that is divided into two divisions: \u010cLAF A and \u010cLAF B. The most successful team is Prague Panthers, whom have won 12 titles.\nThe A7 series is an independent league. It was created for small and rookie teams. It is 7-on-7 football. The final match of the season is called Rice bowl. A7 series is less expensive than \u010cLAF so it can play teams from small towns which don't have sponsors.\nIndividual sports.\nShooting is the third most popular sport in the Czech Republic. Winter sports are also very popular. The country has hosted world championship tournaments for Nordic skiing, ski jumping, and luge. Several Czech competitors have won medals in these kinds of sports internationally, including at the Winter Olympics.\nThe Czech Republic hosts several tennis events each year, including the UniCredit Czech Open in Prost\u011bjov and Prosperita Open in Ostrava, the Sparta Prague Open and Strabag Prague Open in Prague. The best Czech tennis players include Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych, Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek, Martina Navratilova and Petra Kvitov\u00e1."}

William added to his father's territories. He also began to expand Norman influence in West Francia (France). \nEarly career.\nWilliam was born to the Viking Rollo and his Christian wife Poppa of Bayeux. He was born overseas probably in England.\n His mother was from a Frankish noble family. William was baptized a Christian probably at the same time as his father, William's nickname Longsword was probably earned during the fighting in 924\u2013925 around Beauvais, Ponthieu and Amiens.\nDuke of Normandy.\nWilliam succeeded his father as leader in 927 Early in his reign he faced a rebellion from by other Normans who did not think he was fit to lead them. The leader of this rebellion was Riouf of \u00c9vreux. At this same time William sent his wife Sprota to F\u00e9camp where their son Richard was born.\nIn 933, William I Longsword swore to Raoul as King of Western Francia. In turn Raoul gave him lordship over much of the lands of the Bretons including Avranches and the Cotentin. But the Bretons fought to keep these lands. They were led by Alan II, Duke of Brittany and Count Berenger of Rennes. It ended shortly with Alan fleeing to England and Beranger seeking to be on friendly terms with the Normans. In 935, William arranged a marriage between his sister Adela and William, count of Poitou with the approval of Hugh the Great. At the same time William married Luitgarde, daughter of count Herbert II of Vermandois. Her dowry gave William the lands of Longueville, Coudres and Illiers l'Eveque. \nWilliam Longsword attacked Flanders in 939 and Arnulf I, Count of Flanders, and Louis IV, King of France, attacked Normandy because of this. Arnulf captured the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer defeating Herluin, Count of Ponthieu. Herluin helped William Longsword to take back the castle. William was excommunicated for attacking and destroying lands belonging to Arnulf. William pledged his loyalty to King Louis IV when they met in 940. In return for this he was confirmed in lands that had been given to his father, Rollo. Almost three years later, on 17 December 942 at Picquigny on the Somme, William Longsword was attacked and killed by followers of Arnulf while at a peace conference to settle their differences.\nFamily.\nWilliam had one son with Sprota. \nWilliam married secondly Luitgarde, daughter of Herbert II, Count of Vermandois. They had no children."}

They have no traffic-lights or ground level intersections. All roads crossing the highway go over a bridge or a tunnel. Ramps connect the highways to smaller roads and other highways. The place where highways meet these roads are called junctions or interchanges. Places where cars can leave or enter the motorway are called exits.

He was one of the first people to make stop motion clay animation popular. His work began in 1955 with a short movie called \"Gumbasia\". Clokey's work was influenced by his professor at the University of Southern California, Slavko Vorkapich. He and his wife Ruth later created the clay character Gumby. Gumby and his horse Pokey became popular characters on television. They first appeared in the \"Howdy Doody Show\", and later got their own series \"The Adventures of Gumby\".\nEarly life.\nClokey was born Arthur Charles Farrington in Detroit, Michigan. When he was nine years old, his parents divorced. He stayed with his father, Charles Farrington. After his father died in a car accident, he went to live with his mother in California. However, his stepfather refused to raise another man's son, and so Arthur was sent to an orphanage. When he was 11 or 12, he was adopted by Joseph W. Clokey. Clokey was a classical music composer and organist who taught music in Claremont, California. He taught Arthur painting, drawing, and filmmaking.\nThe name of Gumby comes from Arthur's childhood, when he would play with a clay and mud mixture called \"gumbo\".\nClay animation.\nBefore he made Gumby, Clokey did a few experiments with clay animation. Most of these were short movies for adults, including his first movie \"Gumbasia\". Clokey made this in 1953, and released it in 1955. It consisting of animated clay shapes dancing to jazz music. The title \"Gumbasia\" was named after Walt Disney's \"Fantasia\". In 1963, he made \"The Clay Peacock\". This was a reinvention of the animated NBC logo of the time. Clokey's third short movie was \"Mandala\" (6 minutes, 30 seconds). He made it from 1974-1977, and it was released on August 31, 1977. He described it as a metaphor for the evolving human consciousness. All three of these animations were later released to the public on several collections of \"Gumby\" television shorts.\n\"Gumbasia\" caught the attention of Samuel G. Engel, president of the Motion Pictures Producers Association. He paid Clokey to make a short pilot for what became \"The Gumby Show\" (1957). In 1995, Clokey worked with Dallas McKennon to make \"\", a full-length movie. It was not very successful. In the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon signed a contract with Art Clokey to show every episode of \"Gumby\". It was on top of their ratings for over three years.\nClokey's second most-famous work was the \"Davey and Goliath\" cartoon.\nDeath.\nClokey died on January 8, 2010, at his home in Los Osos, California. He was 88 years old. He had been suffering from a infection of the bladder."}

It is a collection of quotations. The book was first printed in 1855. Its eighteenth edition was published in 2012.\nThe quotations are listed by the name of the writer. That is different from other books of quotations that list by subject. The writers are listed by date of birth, not alphabetically. Quotations are arranged in order by time within each writer's entry. The book has an index of the main words used in the quotations. It gives the source of each quotation.\nHistory.\nJohn Bartlett ran the University Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. People often asked him for information on quotations. He began a book of them for reference. In 1855, he privately printed his book as \"A Collection of Familiar Quotations\". This first edition had 258 pages of quotations by 169 authors. Many of the quotations were from the Bible, William Shakespeare, and the great English poets.\nThe book was a great success. Bartlett issued three more editions before joining the Boston publishing firm of Little, Brown, and Company. Bartlett supervised nine editions of the work before his death in 1905.\nThe tenth edition (1914) was edited by Nathan Haskell Dole. It began with quotations originally in English. Most of these quotes were from literary sources. After those, there was a section of quotations from politicians and scientists (such as \"fifty-four forty or fight!\"). After that, there was a section of translated quotations. Those were mostly from the ancient Greeks and Romans. The last section had quotations from the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Quotations were arranged in a single column.\nThe eleventh edition (1937) was edited by Christopher Morley (1890\u20131957) and Louella D. Everett. It had bigger pages and a two-column format. That is more like the format used today. A twelfth edition (1948) was also edited by Morley and Everett.\nThe thirteenth edition (1955) was called the \"Centennial Edition.\" It was credited to the editors of Little, Brown, but the preface gives special thanks to Morley, Everett, and Emily Morison Beck (1915\u20132004). This edition included more recent quotations. The two youngest people quoted were cartoonist Bill Mauldin and Queen Elizabeth II. Beck also edited the fourteenth edition (1968) and the fifteenth (1980).\nAfter Beck's retirement, Little, Brown made Justin Kaplan the editor for the sixteenth edition (1993). His book about Mark Twain, \"Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain\", had won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. Kaplan was criticized for including only three minor Ronald Reagan quotations in this edition, and for saying publicly that he despised Reagan. (Franklin D. Roosevelt had 35 entries and John F. Kennedy had 28.) Kaplan was also criticized for including pop culture material.\nThe seventeenth edition (2003) had similar criticism. It included entries for the first time from J.K. Rowling, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David. Classic quotations were cut, including eleven quotations by Alexander Pope. Kaplan did include six Reagan quotations. He told \"USA Today\" \"I admit I was carried away by prejudice. Mischievously I did him dirty.\"\nThe eighteenth edition (2012) was edited by poet, critic, and editor Geoffrey O'Brien. O'Brien is also the editor-in-chief of the Library of America.\nReferences.\n\"In addition to the prefaces of various editions of\" Bartlett's, \"the following sources were useful\":"}

Richard made Normandy into a feudal society where he owned all the land. His followers held on to the lands given them by remaining loyal to him. He made Normandy a much stronger a power in western France. \nEarly Career.\nRichard was the son of William Longsword, princeps or ruler of Normandy. His mother's name was Sprota. She was a Breton prisoner captured in war who William later married. William Longsword was told of the birth of a son after the battle with Riouf and other viking rebels. But he kept this a secret until a few years later. When he first met his son he kissed him and made him the heir to Normandy. William then sent Richard to be cared for in Bayeux.\nWhen his father died, Richard was only 10 years old (he was born in 933). King Louis IV of France decided to take charge of Normandy himself. The king placed the young duke in the custody of the count of Ponthieu. Then the king gave the lands in lower Normandy to Hugh the Great. Louis kept Richard a prisoner at L\u00e2on. Fearing the king was going to harm the boy Osmond de Centville, Bernard de Senlis (who had been a companion of Richard's grandfather Rollo), Ivo de Bell\u00e8sme, and Bernard the Dane freed Richard.\nDuke of Normandy.\nIn 946, Richard agreed to be a ward of Hugh, Count of Paris. He then allied himself with the Norman and Viking leaders. Together they drove Louis out of Rouen and took back Normandy by 947. In 962 Theobald I, Count of Blois, attacked Rouen. But Richard's army defeated them. Lothair king of West Francia stepped in to prevent any more war between the two. For the rest of his reign Richard chose not to make Normandy bigger. Instead he worked on making Normandy stronger.\nRichard used marriages to build strong alliances. His marriage to Emma gave him a connection to the Capet family. His wife Gunnor was from a rival Viking group in the Cotentin. His marriage to her gave him support from her family. Her sisters married several of Richard's loyal followers. Also Richard's daughters provided valuable marriage alliances with powerful counts as well as to the king of England. Richard also made sure the church and the great monasteries were doing well. His reign was marked by a long period of peace and tranquility. Richard died in Fecamp, Normandy, on 20 November 996.\nMarriages.\nWilliam married first (960)to Emma, daughter of Hugh \"The Great\" of France. They were promised to each other when both were very young. She died after 19 March 968, before they had any children.\nRichard had children with his concubine Gunnora. Richard later married her to make their children legitimate:\nIllegitimate Children.\nRichard was known to have had several other concubines and had children with many of them.\nKnown children are:"}

It extends in a northwest direction into the English Channel. To its west are the Channel Islands and to the southwest is the Brittany Peninsula. It is in the Departement of Manche, in the region of Normandy. The largest town is Cherbourg on the north coast. Cherbourg is a major port on the English Channel. The west coast of the Cotentin known as \"C\u00f4te des \u00celes\" (\"Islands Coast\") faces the Channel Islands. Ferry links serve Carteret, and the islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney from the port of Dielette.\nHistory.\nThe peninsula formed part of what the Romans called Armorica. Coutances was the capital of the Unelli, a Gaulish tribe. It got its name \"Constantia\" in 298 during the reign of Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus. Under the Carolingians it became known as the Cotentin and was controlled by viscounts. For some time these were members of the Saint-Sauveur family. They lived at Saint-Sauveur on the Douve river.\nIn the ninth century, Vikings settled the Cotentin, which became part of Normandy in the early tenth century. Many place names there come from the Norse language. Examples include La Hague, and La-Hougue both derived from the Old Norse word \"haugr\" meaning a hill or mound. Until the construction of modern roads, the peninsula was almost inaccessible in winter because of marshland cutting off the higher ground. This explains occasional historical references to the Cotentin as an island.\nKing Alan the Great of Brittany waged war successfully on the Norsemen. As the result of his conquests, the Cotentin Peninsula was included in the territory of the Duchy of Brittany. After his death, the Norsemen invaded and occupied Brittany from 907 to 939. While they were eventually expelled by Alan's grandson, Alan II, Duke of Brittany, the subsequent rulers of Brittany were weaker than Alan the Great. The succeeding Dukes of Brittany suffered continuing Norse invasions and Norman raids. Eventually the Cotentin Peninsula was lost to the Brittany, and became part of Normandy.\nIn 1088 Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, gave the Cotentin to his brother Henry, later King Henry I of England. Henry, as count of the Cotentin, established his first power base there and in the adjoining Avranchin to the south During the Hundred Years' War, King Edward III of England landed in the bay of La Hogue, and then came to the Church of Quettehou in Val de Saire. It was there that Edward III knighted his son Edward, the Black Prince. A remembrance plaque can be seen next to the altar. The naval Battle of La Hogue in 1692 was fought off Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue near Barfleur.\nThe town of Valognes was, until the French Revolution, a provincial social resort for the , nicknamed the \"Versailles of Normandy\". The social scene was described in the novels of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly (himself from the Cotentin). The grand houses and ch\u00e2teaux; were destroyed during World War II.\nDuring World War II, part of the 1944 Battle of Normandy was fought in the Cotentin. The westernmost part of the D-Day landings was at Utah Beach, on the southeastern coast of the peninsula. What followed was a campaign to occupy the peninsula and take Cherbourg.\nEconomy.\nThe main economical resource is agriculture. Dairy farming is a prominent activity. Along the west coast, renowned vegetables are grown, such as the carrots of Cr\u00e9ances. The renowned trademark \"Florette\" was created in Lessay. The region is also famous for its shellfish culture. These include oysters from Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and Pirou. Other products are alcoholic beverages like cider and calvados, made from locally grown apples and pears.\nThe region hosts two important Nuclear power plants. At Flamanville there is the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant. The other is the COGEMA La Hague site. It is a large nuclear waste reprocessing and storage complex operated by Areva NC. The nuclear power industry provides many jobs in the region. The roads used for transport of nuclear waste have been blocked many times in the past by environmental action group Greenpeace. Local environmental groups have voiced concerns about the radioactivity levels of the cooling water of both these nuclear sites. These are being flushed into the bay of Vauville. However, the radioactivity is much lower than the natural background levels and does not pose any hazard.\nThere are two important naval shipyards in Cherbourg. The state-owned shipyard DCNS has built French nuclear submarines since the 1960s. Privately owned CMN builds frigates and patrol vessels for various states, mostly from the Middle East. Tourism is also an important economic activity in this region. Many tourists visit the D-Day invasion beaches, including Utah Beach in the Cotentin. At Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise a few miles away from the beach, there is a museum dedicated to the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division. The \"Cit\u00e9 de la Mer\" in Cherbourg is a museum of oceanic and underseas subjects. The main attraction is \"Redoutable\", the first French nuclear submarine, launched in 1967.\nCulture.\nDue to its relative isolation the Cotentin is one of the last remaining places the Norman language is spoken. The Norman language writer Alfred Rossel, native of Cherbourg, composed many songs which form part of the heritage of the region. Rossel's song \"Sus la m\u00e9\" (\"on the sea\") is often sung as a regional patriotic song."}

Like his father, Adrien, with whom he performed, Jo-Jo was afflicted with hypertrichosis, an abnormal growth of hair over the face and body. Jo-Jo was covered with long, silky hair and was said to resemble a Skye terrier.\nJo-Jo was born in St Petersburg, Russia in 1868. He began touring Europe in 1873. He was five feet eight inches tall, had only four or five teeth, and spoke Russian, German, and a little English. He dressed like a Russian cavalryman. He would bark at an audience, and would perform as often as 23 times a day. In 1886, he was making US$500 a week.\nJo-Jo toured Europe and Russia, playing in fairgrounds. He was discovered by Charles Reynolds in London, England. Jo-Jo was performing with his father, Adrien, who resembled a poodle. Reynolds realized the Dog-Faced Boy could be presented in a more professional manner. He took the boy to the United States on the \"City of Chicago\" on 12 October 1884.\nA press conference was called. Journalists were allowed to pull Jeftichew's hair to be assured it was real and not pasted on. The \"New York Herald\" described Jeftichew as \"the most extraordinary and absorbingly interesting curiosity that has ever reached these shores.\"\nIn 1884, Jeftichew signed with P. T. Barnum. Barnum stated (falsely) that Jo-Jo was captured by a hunter in the wilds of central Russia. Barnum advertised him as \"the most prodigious paragon of all prodigies secured by P. T. Barnum in fifty years. The Human Skye Terrier, the crowning mystery of nature's contradictions.\"\nHe toured Europe with Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth in 1901 and 1902. He died in Greece in 1904 while on tour of pneumonia. He was the subject of a song recorded by Annette Funicello in the 1960s and was a character in an episode of the television series, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"."}

The sample is carefully chosen. It should represent the whole population fairly, without bias.\nWhen treated as a data set, a sample is often represented by capital letters such as formula_1 and formula_2, with its elements being represented in lowercase (e.g., formula_3), and the sample size being represented by the letter formula_4.\nThe reason samples are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical. Therefore, solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling. Sampling is about choosing which data to take for later analysis. As an example, suppose the pollution of a lake should be analysed for a study. Depending on where the samples of water were taken, the studies can have different results. \nAs a general rule, samples need to be random. This means the chance or probability of selecting one individual is the same as the chance of selecting any other individual.\nIn practice, random samples are always taken by means of a well-defined procedure. A procedure is a set of rules, a sequence of steps written down and exactly followed. Even so, some bias may remain in the sample. Consider the problem of designing a sample to predict the result of an election poll. All known methods have their problems, and the results of an election are often different from predictions based on a sample. If you collect opinions by using telephones, or by meeting people in the street, you won't ask people who don't answer phone calls or who don't walk on the street. Therefore, in cases like this a completely neutral sample is never possible. In such cases a statistician will think about how to measure the amount of bias, and there are ways to estimate this.\nA similar situation occurs when scientists measure a physical property, say the weight of a piece of metal, or the speed of light. If we weigh an object with sensitive equipment we will get minutely different results. No system of measurement is ever perfect. We get a series of estimates, each one being a measurement. These are samples, with a certain degree of error. Statistics is designed to describe error, and carry out analysis on this kind of data.\nThere are different kinds of samples:\nThe way the sampling is obtained, along with the sample size, will have an impact on how the data is viewed.\nStratified sampling.\nIf a population has obvious sub-populations, then each of the sub-populations needs to be sampled. This is called \"stratified sampling\". Stratified sampling is also known as \"stratified random sample\". Stratified sampling is often represented as proportion, such as percent (%).\nSuppose an experiment set out to sample the incomes of adults. Obviously, the incomes of college graduates might differ from that of non-graduates. Now suppose the number of male graduates was 30% of the total male adults (imaginary figures). Then you would arrange for 30% of the total sample to be male graduates picked at random, and 70% of the total to be male non-graduates. Repeat the process for females, because the percentage of female graduates is different from males. That gives a sample of the adult population stratified by sex and college education. The next step would be to divide each of your sub-populations by age groups, because (for example) graduates might gain more income relative to non-graduates in middle age.\nAnother type of stratified sample deals with variation. Here larger samples are taken from the more variable sub-populations so that the summary statistics such as the means and standard deviations, are more reliable."}

She was the daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois. Hugh was born in 895 in Paris, France. His eldest son was Hugh Capet who became King of France in 987. Hugh was a member of the family known as the Robertians.\nDuke of France.\nIn 922 the barons of western Francia revolted against the Carolingian king Charles the Simple. In his place they elected Robert I, Hugh's father, as King of Western Francia. Robert I died in battle at Soissons in 923. When Hugh refused the crown it went to his brother-in-law, Rudolph of France. Charles the simple asked his cousin Herbert II, Count of Vermandois for help in getting back his crown. But instead of helping the king he put him in prison. Herbert then used the threat of releasing his prisoner to get what he wanted. But Charles died in 929. From then on Hugh the great, acting for King Rudolph, had to struggle with Herbert II. Finally Rudolph and Herbert II came to an agreement in 935.\nAt the death of King Rudolph in 936, Hugh possessed nearly all of the region between the Loire and the Seine. This was the same territory as Neustria with the exceptions of Anjou and of Normandy. Hugh was one of those who brought Louis IV (\"d'Outremer\") from the Kingdom of England in 936. In 937 Hugh married Hedwige of Saxony, a daughter of Henry I the Fowler of Germany and Matilda of Ringelheim. Very soon however Hugh was quarrelling with King Louis.\nIn 939 king Louis attacked Hugh the Great and William I, Duke of Normandy. But soon after they made a truce which lasted until June. That same year Hugh, along with Herbert II of Vermandois, Arnulf I, Count of Flanders and Duke William Longsword paid homage to the Emperor Otto the Great. They supported him in his struggle against Louis. When Louis fell into the hands of the Normans in 945, he was handed over to Hugh in exchange for their young duke Richard. Hugh released Louis IV in 946 but made him surrender the fortress of Laon. In 948 at a church council at Ingelheim the bishops excommunicated Hugh even though he was not there. Hugh's response was to attack Soissons and Reims. Hugh finally changed his mind and made peace with Louis IV, and the church.\nWhen Louis IV died Hugh was one of the first to recognize Lothair as his successor. For helping to have him crowned the new king gave Hugh Burgundy and Aquitaine. In the same year Giselbert, Duke of Burgundy acknowledged Hugh as his overlord and gave his daughter in marriage to Hugh's son Otto-Henry. On 16 June 956 Hugh the Great died in Dourdan.\nFamily.\nIn 922 Hugh married Judith, the daughter of Roger, Count of Maine and Rothilde. She died childless in 925.\nHugh's second wife was Eadhild, daughter of Edward the Elder, king of the Anglo-Saxons. They married in 926 and she died in 938, childless.\nHugh's third wife was Hedwig of Saxony, daughter of Henry the Fowler and Matilda of Ringelheim. She and Hugh had:"}

{"id": "411208", "revid": "971862", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411208", "title": "Richard II, Duke of Normandy", "text": "Richard II (\u2020 1026), called the Good (French: \"Le Bon\"), was the Duke of Normandy from 996 to 1026. He was the first to assume the title of duke and built up his court to resemble that of a king. He commissioned Dudo of Saint-Quentin to write a detailed history of the Norman Dukes showing their and Christian patronage.\nEarly career.\nRichard II was the oldest son of Richard I the Fearless and Gunnora. He succeeded his father as Duke of Normandy in 996. During his minority, which was the first five years of his reign, his was his uncle Count Ralph of Ivrea. Ralph put down a peasant revolt at the start of Richard's reign.\nRichard was very religious like his overlord king Robert II of France. Richard used his army to support the king against the duchy of Burgundy. He formed a marriage alliance with Brittany by marrying his sister Hawise of Normandy to Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany. It became a double alliance when he married Geoffrey's sister, Judith of Brittany.\nVikings and England.\nIn the 980s the Vikings had been raiding England again. They would then cross the English Channel to Normandy to sell their plunder. Norman and Viking relations were good. Richard's father had hired Viking mercenaries in the 960s. He also allowed them safe haven in Normandy. This caused problems in England and with the Pope in Rome. In 990 representatives of the Pope negotiated a treaty between England and Normandy. Richard I agreed not to aid enemies of England (including Vikings). From 997 to 1000 a great Viking army attacked Wessex a number of times. In 1000 they came to Normandy and were allowed to land by Richard II. This broke the treaty between his father and the English king. In 1000-1001 the English attacked Normandy on the Cotentin Peninsula. The raid was led by king Ethelred the Unready of England. Ethelred had given orders that Richard be captured, shackled and brought to England. But the English were not prepared for the rapid response of the Norman cavalry and were quickly defeated.\nRichard wanted to make peace with the English king. He gave his sister Emma of Normandy in marriage to King Ethelred. Ethelred gave Emma the city of Exeter as a dowry. This turned out to be an important marriage as it later gave Richard's grandson, William the Conqueror, a claim to the throne of England. In 1013 when Sweyn Forkbeard invaded England, Emma with her two sons Edward and Alfred fled to Normandy. After losing his throne King Ethelred followed shortly. Soon after the death of Ethelred, Cnut, King of England forced Emma to marry him. Duke Richard was forced to recognize the new regime as his sister was again Queen. \nNorman prestige.\nRichard II commissioned Dudo of Saint-Quentin, his clerk and priest, to write about his ancestors. He was to tell the story of the Norman dukes in a way that showed their Christian morals. He wanted them shown to be good and upright leaders who built Normandy despite the bad behavior of their Frankish neighbors. It has been called by some historians a work of propaganda. While it contains a number of stories and legends, nowhere did Dudo claim the stories to be facts. When he wrote his work on the Customs and Deeds of the First Dukes of the Normans, Dudo seems to have met his goal \"to tell in the noblest style the story of a noble destiny.\"\nIn 1025 and 1026 Richard confirmed gifts of his ancestor Rollo to Saint-Ouen at Rouen. He gave many other gifts to Monasteries. Their names show the areas over which Richard had ducal control: Caen, the \u00c9verecin, the Cotentin, the Pays de Caux and Rouen.\nRichard II died 28 Aug 1026.\nMarriages.\nHe married firstly, , Judith (992\u20131017), daughter of Conan I of Brittany, by whom he had the following issue:\nSecondly he married Poppa of Envermeu. They had the following children:"}

The first collection was written in 1722 and the second was written in 1742, but they were not published until 1801, fifty years after Bach died. Although the music was written for the harpsichord, which was popular at the time, today it is usually played and heard on a piano.\nBoth collections have 24 short preludes and 24 fugues to go along with it. All of them contrast with each other: some of them are easy to learn, while others are hard to follow (because there are many different melodies going on at the same time, which is called counterpoint). What is special about them is that each prelude and fugue is written in a different major or minor key. They appear in the book so that they go up by semitones. That is, the first prelude and fugue is in C major, the second is in C minor, the third in C-sharp major (or D-flat major), the fourth in C-sharp minor, and so on, until the last two preludes and fugues are in B major and B minor, in that order.\nOther composers would later write music that is also in all 24 major and minor keys. The best known of these are the Preludes by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, but this would also later be done by Charles-Valentin Alkan, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Dmitri Shostakovich, to name a few.\nSome of the music that appears in \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" has become famous. For example, the French Romantic composer Charles Gounod wrote a setting of Ave Maria that is based on the melody of the first Prelude in C Major in the \"WTC\"."}

He served in Burma during World War II, under the command of Lord Mountbatten. He is very well known in India and Pakistan. He is famous for his tragic love story with Zainab, a Muslim girl who he rescued from the riots during the partition of India in 1947. \nLove story.\nBoth fell in love and got married. Later, Zainab was deported (sent back) to Pakistan. Boota illegally entered Pakistan to find her. Zainab stayed away from him due to pressure from her family. Because of this, he killed himself by jumping in front of a moving train near Shahdara railway station in Pakistan. He did this with his daughter, but she survived.\nThe love story of Singh's life has been adapted to movies and books, from both India and Pakistan. A Punjabi movie \"Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh\" (1999) is entirely based on the story. Ishrat Rahmani wrote a book, \"Muhabbat\", based on the story. The story also influenced many other movies including \"Partition\", a Hollywood movie from 2007.\nPersonal life.\nSingh lived in a village of Jalandhar district in British Punjab. When he returned home from fighting in Burma, his youth was over. All his friends were married with their own families, but he was still not married. He found no woman to marry him. Once a trader offered to sell Singh a bride from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar for rupees 2000/-. From this day onward, he started saving all his money for the dowry.\nHis uncle and cousins were wanting him to die unmarried, so that they could inherit his share of the family's land.\nBurial.\nIn his suicide note, Singh expressed his last wish to be buried as a Muslim in Noorpur village near Barki. This is where Zainab's parents had resettled after the Partition. The autopsy of Singh's body was done in a hospital in Lahore. It was taken to the village on 22 February 1957 for burial. However, the villagers did not allow him to be buried there. Instead, Singh was buried at Miani Sahib Graveyard of Lahore.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1999, Manoj Punj directed a Punjabi feature movie, \"Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh\", entirely based on the life story of Boota Singh. The movie stars Gurdas Maan as Boota Singh and Divya Dutta as Zainab. The music was composed by Amar Haldipur. It was a success internationally. It won the \"National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Punjabi\" at the 46th National Film Awards. It was also shown at many national and international movie festivals, including the 1999 Vancouver International Film Festival and the International Film Festival of India. Ishrat Rahmani wrote a novel on the love story, titled \"Muhabbat\". The story also featured in an English book, \"Freedom at Midnight\", by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre."}

Typical components used with passive crossovers are capacitors inductors and resistors. If passive crossover uses resistors to adjust loudness, those generate heat. Instead, active devices typically use resistors and capacitors with other audioelectronic components and those typically don't consume so much electric power. Also, active crossovers are easily built to be adjustable. Still, that doesn't mean that using passive crossover means low quality."}

Her family was very influential in western Normandy and Gunnora was said to be very wealthy. Her marriage to Richard I was of great political importance. It allied him with a powerful rival family in the Cotentin. Her brother, Herfast de Crepon, was the of a great Norman family. Her sisters and nieces married some of the most important nobles in Normandy. \nAt the time the Normans were used to more than one kind of marriage. Richard I wanted his son Robert to become the Archbishop of Rouen. He was told the church would not allow it because he and Gunnora were not married in a Christian ceremony. So he married Gunnora \"according to the Christian custom\", making their children legitimate in the eyes of the church.\nGunnora signed many ducal charters up into the 1020s. She was skilled in languages and had an excellent memory. She was a source of information on Norman history for Dudo of St. Quentin. Her husband depended on her as is shown in the couple's charters where she held several important positions. She was at times regent of Normandy, a and a judge. In a typical roll for a medieval aristocratic mother, she was an between her husband and their oldest son Richard II.

She gave them for the soul of her husband, for her own soul and that of her sons \"count Richard, archbishop Robert, and others...\" She also signed a charter, , to that same abbey as \"Gonnor matris comitis\" (Gunnor, mother of the count). Gunnora, as wife and countess, was able to use her influence to see her kin favored, and several of the most prominent Anglo-Norman families on both sides of the English Channel are descended from her, her sisters and her nieces.

They had two crew: one man was the pilot and the other aimed the guns.\nDefiants were made to shoot down enemy bomber aircraft. When they were used during the Battle of Britain, they were good at this. But they were slower and could not turn as well as German fighter planes, like the Messerschmitt Bf 109. A lot of Defiants were shot down by German fighters.\nAfter the Battle of Britain, the British only flew Defiants at night.

In Israel, the date of the holiday is 22 Tishrei on the Hebrew calendar. Outside of Israel, it is two days long, on 22-23 Tishrei. On the Gregorian calendar, Shemini Atzeret comes in late September or early or middle October.\nThe holiday is best known for the celebration of Simchat Torah (\u05e9\u05b4\u05c2\u05de\u05b0\u05d7\u05b5\u05ea \u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4), \"Rejoicing of the Torah\", when Jews finish the annual cycle of reading the whole Torah out loud in synagogue. Outside Israel, \"Simchat\" Torah is celebrated on the second day of the holiday. Most people outside Israel use the name \"Shemini Atzeret\" for the first day only. They call the second day \"Simchat Torah\" because of this celebration. In Israel, the one day of the holiday is called by both names.\nIn some ways, this holiday is part of the holiday of Sukkot. The \"shemini\" (\"8th\") is the \"8th day\" of Sukkot. In other ways, this holiday is a separate holiday on its own, and not part of Sukkot. \nShemini Atzeret is an important Jewish holiday. Like on Shabbat and other important Jewish holidays, work is not allowed on Shemini Atzeret.\nSources in the Torah.\nThe holiday of Shemini Atzeret is in the Torah (Pentateuch) twice, at and at . The Torah does not say much about the holiday, though.\nShemini Atzeret and Sukkot.\nThe Torah says that this holiday falls on the eighth day of Sukkot. However, in the same paragraph, the celebrations of Sukkot are described as lasting \"seven\" days, not eight. The Talmud writes about this apparent(def. 2) problem. At the end of the section, the Talmud says that at the same time,\nThe laws and customs of Shemini Atzeret show both pieces of the holiday.\nHow Shemini Atzeret is celebrated.\nSome Jewish holidays have special rituals, like the Seder of Passover or the sukkah, lulav and etrog of Sukkot. In the Torah, there are no rituals like that for Shemini Atzeret. But starting at the time of the Talmud, Shemini Atzeret became the holiday for finishing the annual reading of the Torah in the synagogue. The celebration of that\u2014called Simchat Torah\u2014 has become the main feature(def. n2) of the holiday.\nSimchat Torah.\nIn synagogues, one section of the Torah is read on every Shabbat of the year. The last section, from Deuteronomy, is read on the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. Over the last 1000 years, the reading of the last section has become a big celebration called Simchat Torah, or \"Rejoicing of the Torah\". This celebration is so important that the whole day of the celebration is called \"Simchat Torah.\" In Israel, this celebration happens on the single day of the holiday, 22 Tishrei. Outside of Israel, it happens on the second of the two days, 23 Tishrei.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Simchat Torah\" does not appear in the Torah or the Talmud. The Talmud says that the final section of the Torah is read on Shemini Atzeret. But it does not use the name Simchat Torah, and it does not describe a special celebration. The first reference to any kind of celebration comes from the perioddef. \"n1\" of the \"Geonim\" (7th-11th centuries CE). That source mentioned the custom of dancing with the Torah, which is still a custom today.\nIn modern times, Simchat Torah has become a day to show Jewish pride in public. \nSimchat Torah evening.\nSimchat Torah evening is a and child-friendly holiday. After the regular holiday evening prayers, all the Torahs are taken from the . Members of the synagogue march or dance around the synagogue seven times with the Torahs. Each time around the synagogue, the people pray \"Save us! Answer us on the day we call!\" Sometimes the dancing moves from the synagogue to the street outside. Sometimes the dancing can go late into the evening, with extra songs and prayers added. One very common custom is for people\u2014especially children\u2014to march or dance with flags, sometimes with candles or apples on top. At the end of the dancing in most synagogues, a piece of the last Torah portion in Deuteronomy is read in public. In Orthodox and Conservative synagogues, the very end of Deuteronomy is not read at night. But in Reform synagogues, it sometimes is.\nSimchat Torah morning.\nAfter the regular holiday morning prayers, the dancing and marching of the previous night are repeated. After that, every adult member of the synagogue is called to the Torah for an \"aliyah\" (honor), says blessings, and has several verses of the Torah read. Depending on the size of the synagogue, this can take a long time. Different synagogues have different ways to do this:\nOnce all eligible adults have received an honor, the celebration comes to its highest point. The last three honors go to distinguished members of the synagogue:\nFor all of these honors, the person honored stands under a \"tallit\" (prayer ) held open like the \"\u1e25uppa,\" or , in a Jewish wedding.\n\"Hakafot Shniyot\".\nIn Israel, it has become common to add an extra night of celebration to Simchat Torah. This is called \"Hakafot Shniyot\" (Second Circuits). It happens on 23 Tishrei, the same night as Jews in the rest of the world celebrate Simchat Torah. This is a way for Jews around the world to show Jewish pride together. Because the holiday of Shemini Atzeret is over after one day in Israel, holiday restrictions do not apply. So \"Hakafot Shniyot\" can include things not normally allowed on Shabbat and Jewish holidays (like bands and photography).\nPractices from Sukkot.\nThe Torah states that it is a requirement for Jews to be happy on Sukkot. The Talmud writes that this requirement lasts for eight days\u2014the seven days of Sukkot \"and\" Shemini Atzeret. As part of this, Hallel is said in synagogue during the morning prayers of Shemini Atzeret.\nIn Israel, this is the only practice from Sukkot that continues into Shemini Atzeret. In every other way Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday with separate practices.\nOutside Israel, this is complicated by the Jewish law of adding an extra day to every Biblical Jewish holiday except Yom Kippur. The holiday of Sukkot, which lasts seven days in Israel lasts eight days outside Israel. But the eighth day is also the first day of the separate holiday of Shemini Atzeret. Sometimes the rules for the two holidays conflict. Figuring out the conflicts can be complicated. But the general rule is that \nIn practice, what happens \"only outside of Israel\" is that\nNone of this happens on the second day of Shemini Atzeret (Simchat Torah), because it is no longer an extra day of Sukkot."}

He was born . Around the year 1120, Richard's father sent him in command of a large army to rescue his brother-in-law, Reginald I, Count of Burgundy. It was a distance of about 250\u00a0miles (400\u00a0kilometers) from Normandy. Richard III's capture of the castle of Minamde was enough to convince Bishop Hugh to surrender and release Reginald.\nWhen his father died in August of 1026, as the oldest son, Richard III succeeded him as Duke of Normandy.

He raided the diocese of his uncle Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. He also captured his brother's city of Falaise. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027. Finally Richard III laid to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised to be faithful.\nRichard III then took the next step; he arranged with king Robert II of France to marry his young daughter, Adelis. She was given rich dowry which included the city and county of Coutances. Even though he was now newly married to a king's daughter, he already had children by a concubine. But unexpectedly Richard III died on 5 or 6 August 1027. He had a son named Nicholas, but the boy was immediately sent to the at F\u00e9camp.

After Richard's death Adela secondly married Baldwin V, Count of Flanders.\nIssue.\nBy his wife Adela he had no children.\nBy an unknown concubine he had at least two children:"}

These objects may be stars, planets or even satellites. There are several such coordinate systems listed below. All of them are spherical.\nThe fundamental plane divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the equator in the geographic coordinate system. The poles are located at \u00b190\u00b0 from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates.\nCoordinate systems.\nThese are common coordinate systems used by the astronomical community:\nHorizontal system.\nThe horizontal system is based on the position of the observer on Earth. It is a useful coordinate system for finding and tracking objects for observers on Earth. It is based on the position of stars relative to an observer's true or ideal horizon.\nEquatorial system.\nThe equatorial coordinates are based on the position of stars relative to the Earth's equator. Imagine the Earth's equator extended out to an infinite distance. The equatorial describes the sky as seen from the solar system. \"Modern star maps almost exclusively use equatorial coordinates\".\nEclyptic system.\nThe fundamental plane is the plane of the Earth's orbit, also called the ecliptic plane. There are two versions: the geocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the Earth, and heliocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the centre of mass of the solar system.\nThe geocentric ecliptic system was the principal coordinate system for ancient astronomy and is still useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.\nThe heliocentric ecliptic system describes the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and centres on the barycenter of the solar system. This is very close to the centre of the Sun). The system is mainly used for computing the positions of planets and other solar system bodies, and their orbits.\nGalactic system.\nThe galactic coordinate system uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane. The solar system is still the centre of the coordinate system, and the zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactic centre. 'Galactic latitude' means, roughly, the elevation above the galactic plane. 'Galactic longitude' is the direction relative to the centre of the galaxy.\nSupergalactic system.\nThe supergalactic coordinate system is a fundamental plane with a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.\nSoftware.\nThere is standard software which does the calculations:"}

For example, fish use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey. They are faint lines running lengthwise down each side, from the gill covers to the base of the tail. \nIn some species, the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors, which are organs used to detect electrical impulses.

He was probably born between 1005 and 1010.\nTheir father had decided that the older son, Richard III, would succeed him as duke. Robert would became Count of Hi\u00e9mois. In August 1026 their father, Richard II, died and Richard III became the fifth duke. But once Richard III began to reign, Robert was not satisfied with his position. He raided the diocese of his uncle Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. He also captured his brother's city of Falaise. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027. Finally Richard III laid to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised his .\nEarly reign.\nWhen Richard III died shortly after Robert's surrender, there were suspicions that Robert might have caused his brother's death. Robert was accepted, however, as the sixth duke following his brother. But the Robert I had started against his brother Richard III didn't stop when the two made peace. There were still many feuds which had started between neighboring barons. These continued in Normandy during much of Robert\u2019s reign. It was also during this time that many of the lesser left Normandy to seek their fortunes in southern Italy and elsewhere. Soon after he became duke and possibly in revenge for supporting his brother, Robert I gathered an army and began raiding the lands of his uncle, Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. Only a brief allowed his uncle to leave Normandy in exile. The Archbishop then placed an of on Robert and all of Normandy. The edict was only removed when Archbishop Robert was allowed to return and all his lands were restored. Robert also attacked another powerful church leader, his cousin Hugo d'Ivry, Bishop of Bayeux. Robert banished him from Normandy. Robert also seized a number of church properties belonging to the abbey of F\u00e9camp.\nOutside of Normandy.\nIn spite of all his troubles in Normandy Robert decided to get involved in the civil war in Flanders. This feud was between Baldwin V, Count of Flanders and his father Baldwin IV who the younger Baldwin had driven out of Flanders. Baldwin V, supported by king Robert II of France, his , was persuaded to make peace with his father in 1030. This happened only after Duke Robert promised the elder Baldwin his military support.\nRobert gave shelter to Henry I of France against his mother, Queen Constance. The queen wanted her younger son Robert to succeed his father Robert II as king of France. For his help Henry I gave Robert the French Vexin. In the early 1030s Alan III, Duke of Brittany began to expand from the area of Rennes and appeared to have wanted the area around Mont Saint-Michel After raiding Dol and stopping Alan's attempts to raid Avranches, Robert mounted a major campaign against his cousin Alan III. However, Alan appealed to Archbishop Robert of Rouen (they were both his nephews). The Archbishop arranged a peace between Duke Robert and his vassal Alan III.\nRobert's cousins, the Athelings Edward and Alfred, had been living in exile at the Norman Court. They were the sons of his aunt Emma of Normandy and Athelred, King of England. At some point Robert attempted an invasion of England on their behalf but was stopped by unfavorable winds. The king of England, Cnut the Great sent envoys to Duke Robert offering to settle half the Kingdom of England on Edward and Alfred. After postponing the invasion he chose to also postpone the decision until after he returned from Jerusalem.\nThe Church and his pilgrimage.\nRobert's attitude towards the Church changed completely since his uncle's return from exile. To make up for what he had done to the Church earlier he restored all the property that he or his vassals had taken. He also decided to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to make up for his sins. After making his illegitimate son William his heir, he set out on his pilgrimage. He travelled by way of Constantinople and reached Jerusalem. He fell seriously ill and died on the return journey at Nicaea on 2 July 1035. His son William, aged about eight, succeeded him.\nAccording to the historian William of Malmesbury, decades later, Robert's son William sent a mission to Constantinople and Nicaea to return his father's body to Normandy for . Permission was granted, but, having travelled as far as Apulia (Italy) on the return journey, the learned that William himself had died. They then decided to Robert's body in Italy.\nIssue.\nBy his concubine, Herleva of Falaise, he was father of:"}

It lies centered on the mouth of the Somme River. It includes the townships of Crecy-en-Ponthieu, Nouvion-en-Ponthieu and Ailly-le-Haut-Bell. \nHistory.\nNorman conquest of England.\nPonthieu played a small role in the events that led up to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Harold Godwinson of England was blown ashore at Ponthieu in 1064. He was taken captive by the men of Guy I and held for at the castle of Beaurain. Thinking Harold might be useful to him William II, Duke of Normandy, secured his release. William escorted him to Rouen and gave him many gifts. \nwilliam then had Harold take 'many oaths' to support his claim to the English throne and to become William's vassal. But a year after Harold's return to England when king Edward the Confessor died, Harold quickly forgot his oaths and took the crown for himself. That same year Harold was killed at Battle of Hastings and William became King of England.\nIn 1067 the chaplain of Matilda of Flanders, Guy, Bishop of Amiens, composed Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, a Latin poem on the battle of Hastings.\nIn 1150 the Count of Ponthieu built a fortress for himself at Crotoy, a strategic point on the mouth of the river Somme.\nThe Hundred Years' War.\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, Ponthieu a number of times. The English claimed control of it from 1279\u20131369 and again until 1435. During English control of Ponthieu, Abbeville was used as the capital.\nIn late August 1346 Edward III of England reached the region of Ponthieu. While he was there rebuilt the fortress at Crotoy. He forced a passage of the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque. The army led by Philip VI of France caught up with him at nearby Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu, leading to the famous Battle of Cr\u00e9cy.\nIn 1360, the Treaty of Bretigny between King John II of France and Edward III of England gave control of Ponthieu (along with Gascony and Calais) over to the English, in exchange for Edward relinquishing his claim to the French throne. Edward took the land but still refused to surrender his claim.\nIn April, 1369 Charles V of France conquered Ponthieu. A month later he declared war on England. As a result, Edward publicly reassumed the title 'King of France' in June.\nIn 1372 an English army under the leadership of Robert Knolles invaded Ponthieu. They burned the city of Le Crotoy before crossing the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque.\nIn the Treaty of Arras (1435), Charles VII of France convinced Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to break his alliance with the English. In exchange he gave him Ponthieu. This marked a turning point that led to the end of England's part in the conflict 40 years later.&lt;br&gt; \nIn 1477 Ponthieu was reconquered by King Louis XI of France.\nIn World War I between 1 July and 18 November 1916 the Battle of the Somme was fought in Ponthieu. It was one of the most costly battles ever fought with over 1,000,000 men killed or wounded."}

Most of the town is on the east bank of the Somme, as well as on an island. It is at the start of the Abbeville Canal, and is northwest of Amiens. In the medieval period, it was the lowest crossing point on the Somme. Edward III's army crossed nearby shortly before the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.\nAdministration.\nAbbeville was the capital of the former province of France of Ponthieu. Today, it is one of the three s of the Somme department.\nEtymology.\nThe Romans occupied it and named it \"Abbatis Villa\".\nPrehistory.\nThe name Abbeville has been adopted to name a category of paleolithic stone tools. These stone tools are also known as handaxes. Various handaxes were found near Abbeville by Jacques Boucher de Perthes during the 1830s. He was the first to describe the stones in detail. He pointed out in the first publication of its kind, that the stones were chipped deliberately by early man, so as to form a tool. These stone tools which are some of the earliest found in Europe, were chipped on both sides so as to form a sharp edge, were known as 'Abbevillian' handaxes or bifaces, but recently the term 'abevillian' is becoming obsolete as the earlier form of stone tool, not found in Europe, is known as the Oldowan chopper. Some of these are displayed at the museum Boucher-de-Perthes.\nA more refined form from a later period of handaxe production was found in the Abbeville/Somme River district. The more refined handaxe became known as the Acheulean industry, named after Saint-Acheul, today a suburb of Amiens. It retained some importance into the Bronze Age.\nHistory.\nAbbeville during the ninth century was part of the diocese of Saint-Riquier. It was also an important fortress responsible for the defense of the Somme. Abbeville had a charter granted to it in 1184. Afterwards it was governed by the Counts of Ponthieu. Together with that county, it came into the possession of the Alen\u00e7on and other French families. Afterwards it came into the possession of the House of Castile. By marriage it passed in 1272 to King Edward I of England. In 1435, by the treaty of Arras, it was to the Duke of Burgundy. In 1477 it was taken control of by King Louis XI of France. Later it was held by two illegitimate branches of the royal family in the 16th and 17th centuries, being in 1696 returned to the crown. In 1514, the town was the place where the marriage of Louis XII of France to Mary Tudor took place. She was the daughter of Henry VII of England. In 1685, it suffered a serious economic when the Edict of Nantes was repealed. The Protestants who were the majority of the skilled labor, left town. The town never fully recovered from the loss of their talents.\nAbbeville was fairly important in the 18th century. Van Robais Royal Manufacture (one of the first major factories in France) brought great prosperity to the town. Voltaire, among others, wrote about it.\nAbbeville was the birthplace of Rear Admiral Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Courbet (1827\u201385). His victories on land and at sea made him a national hero during the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). Courbet died in June 1885 in the Pescadores Islands. His body was brought back to France and buried in Abbeville on 1 September 1885 after a state funeral. Abbeville's old Haymarket Square (Place du March\u00e9-au-Bl\u00e9) was renamed Place de l'Amiral Courbet in July 1885. This was shortly after the news of Courbet's death reached France. A statue of Courbet was erected in the middle of the square at the end of the nineteenth century. The statue was damaged in a bombing raid during World War II.\nOn 12 September 1939 in Abbeville a conference took place. There France and the United Kingdom decided it was too late to send troops to help Poland in its fight against Germany. By this time Poland was already on the verge of defeat. After five years\u2014in September 1944\u2014Abbeville was liberated by the Polish First Armoured Division under General Maczek.\nThe Blitzkrieg.\nIn 1940, the Germans with the bulk of their armoured force in Panzer Group von Kleist achieved a breakthrough at Sedan with air support. The Panzer group raced to the coast of the English Channel at Abbeville. This isolated (20 May 1940) the British Expeditionary Force, Belgian Army, and some divisions of the French Army in northern France. The Battle of France was lost by the Allies.\nCharles de Gaulle (17\u201318 May 1940), as a Colonel in this period, launched a in the region of Laon (see the map). He had 80 tanks to destroy the communication of the German armoured troops. His newly formed 4e Division cuirass\u00e9e reached Montcornet, resulting in the Battle of Montcornet. But, without support, the 4th DCR was forced to retreat. There was another counterattack with the Battle of Abbeville. After Laon (24 May), de Gaulle was promoted to temporary general: \"On 28 May (...) the 4th DCR attacked twice to destroy a pocket captured by the enemy south of the Somme near Abbeville. The operation was successful, with over 400 prisoners taken and the entire pocket mopped up except for Abbeville (...) but in the second attack the 4th DCR failed to gain control of the city in the face of superior enemy numbers.\" WWII was not kind to the buildings of the town as the famous 17th century Gothic Cathedral of St. Vulfran was nearly destroyed.\nEconomy.\nAbbeville manufactures ; in particular, linens and tablecloths. It also has factories and spinning mills. Finally, it also makes locks and produces sugar.\nSights.\nThe city was very picturesque until the early days of the World War II. It was bombed mostly to rubble in one night by the Germans. The town overall is now mostly modern and rebuilt. Several of the town's attractions remain, including:\nTransport.\nAbbeville is served by trains on the line between Boulogne-sur-Mer and Amiens. Abbeville was the southern terminus of the R\u00e9seau des Bains de Mer, the line to Dompierre-sur-Authie opened on 19 June 1892 and closed on 10 March 1947."}

He was a member of the Carolingian dynasty.\nEarly life.\nCharles was the third and posthumous son of Louis the Stammerer by his second wife, Adelaide of Paris. As a child, Charles was not allowed to become king in 884 when his half-brother Carloman died. The Frankish nobles instead asked his cousin, Charles the Fat, to rule over them. King Charles the Fat was not a good king so he was removed (deposed) in November 887. He died soon after in January 888. The nobility elected Odo, the hero of the Siege of Paris as their king. Charles Simplex was put under the protection of Ranulf II of Aquitaine who used the royal title himself until making peace with Odo.\nKing of Western Francia.\nIn 893 Charles was finally crowned by part of the nobility who were opposed to Odo. He was crowned at Reims Cathedral but was not fully accepted as king until Odo died in 898.\nIn 911, a group of Vikings lead by Rollo besieged Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to negotiate with Rollo. The talks were led by Herv\u00e9, the Archbishop of Reims. This resulted in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, which granted Rollo and his soldiers all the land between the river Epte and the sea. It also granted him Brittany, \"for his livelihood\". At the time, Brittany was an independent land which France had not been able to conquer. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty and military assistance when needed. Also Rollo also agreed to be baptised and to marry Gisela, the king's daughter. The territory given Rollo is about the same as Upper Normandy. This would grow to become Normandy under Rollo's descendants. \nAlso in 911, Louis the Child, the King of Germany, died. The nobles of Lotharingia made Charles their new king even though some had elected Conrad of Franconia king. Charles had tried to win their support for years. In April 907 he married a Lotharingian noblewoman named Frederuna. He also defended Lotharingia twice against attacks by Conrad, King of the Germans. Queen Frederuna died on 10 February 917 leaving six daughters and no sons. so Charles did not have an heir. On 7 October 919 Charles married again to Eadgifu of Wessex (England). She was the daughter of Edward the Elder, King of England. She bore him his only son, the future King Louis IV of France. \nCharles' had a favorite at court, a man named Hagano. This turned his nobles against Charles. He gave Hagano several monasteries that already belonged to other barons which angered them. Charles also turned the new duke, Gilbert against him. He turned his support to the German king Henry the Fowler in 919. Not everyone in Lotharingia was against Charles; he kept the support of Wigeric.\nRevolt of the nobles.\nFinally the nobles seized Charles in 920. They were tired of Charles' policies and his favoritism of count Hagano. \nBut after negotiations by Archbishop Herveus of Reims the king was released.\nIn 922 the Frankish nobles revolted again led by Robert of Neustria. Robert was Odo's brother and was elected king by the rebels. Charles had to flee to Lotharingia. On 2 July 922, Charles lost his most faithful supporter, Herveus of Reims. Charles returned with a Norman army in 923 but was defeated on 15 June near Soissons by Robert, who died in the battle. Charles was captured and in a castle at P\u00e9ronne under the guard of Herbert II of Vermandois. Charles' English wife Eadgifu and their son Louis fled to England. Robert's Rudolph of Burgundy was elected to succeed him. In 925 the Lotharingia became part of the Kingdom of Germany. Charles died in prison on 7 October 929 and was buried at the nearby abbey of Saint-Fursy. His only son by Eadgifu would later be crowned in 936 as Louis IV of France.\nFamily.\nCharles married first, in May 907, Frederuna, daughter of Dietrich, Count in the Hamaland.

He was also Count of Maine. His reign as Duke is noted for the conflicts he had with his brothers in England. This led to the dukedom of Normandy being reunited with crown of England.\nEarly career.\nRobert was the eldest son of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, and Matilda of Flanders. Robert was born . As a child he was to Margaret, the heiress of Maine. But she died before they could be wed. Robert didn't marry until he was in his late forties.\nRobert was brought up among William's . As a result, he became a skilled warrior. But unlike his father he expected to live a life of pleasure and luxury. In 1063, his father made him the count of Maine when he was contracted to marry Margaret. But Robert had no authority. The county was actually run by his father until 1069 when the county revolted and reverted to Hugh V of Maine. Still, he had been made his father's heir. Twice the barons had taken an oath of fealty to him as their future leader.\nIn 1077 Robert got into an argument with his father. He demanded to rule Normandy which he had on at least on occasion while William was in England. William was not able to reason with his son and Robert left angry. The next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize Rouen. The siege failed. After rebelling against his father all he could do was go into exile. \nRobert first went to Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais. He then fled to Flanders to the court of his uncle Robert I, Count of Flanders. \nIn the spring of 1080 Robert was back on good terms with his father. He again made Robert his heir for Normandy in the presences of his barons. Later that summer or early fall Robert went with his father to England. William placed Robert in charge of a large army to march north and deal with King Malcolm III of Scotland. Malcolm had been raiding the north of England while William was occupied in Normandy. When the two armies drew near each other, Malcolm did not want to fight. He again swore fealty to king William and gave hostages. Robert remained in England with his father until the end of 1081. Events in Maine caused William and Robert to return to Normandy. Fulk IV, Count of Anjou had been attacking in Maine again trying to get control away from Normandy. William and Robert led a great army into Maine to confront the Angevin count. Before the fighting could start, a cardinal and several monks stopped the battle. They called for a truce and after much negotiation one was agreed to. The count of Anjou was to let Normandy have Maine, but Robert, as count of Maine, had to recognize Fulk IV as his overlord for Maine. When Queen Matilda died in 1083 Robert seemed to abandon his father. He and his mother had been very close. \nIn 1087, the Conqueror died of wounds suffered from a riding accident during a siege of Mantes. At his death he reportedly wanted to disinherit his eldest son but was persuaded to divide the Norman dominions between his two eldest sons. To Robert he granted the Duchy of Normandy and to William Rufus he granted the Kingdom of England. The youngest son Henry was given money to buy land. Of the two elder sons Robert was considered to be much the weaker and was generally preferred by the nobles who held lands on both sides of the English Channel since they could more easily circumvent his authority. At the time of their father's death the two brothers made an agreement to be each other's heir. However this peace lasted less than a year when barons joined with Robert to displace Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088. It was not a success, in part because Robert never showed up to support the English rebels.\nRobert took as his close adviser Ranulf Flambard, who had been previously a close adviser to his father. Flambard later became an astute but much-disliked financial adviser to William Rufus until the latter's death in 1100.\nIn 1096, Robert left for the Holy Land on the First Crusade. At the time of his departure he was reportedly so poor that he often had to stay in bed for lack of clothes. In order to raise money for the crusade he mortgaged his duchy to his brother William for the sum of 10,000 marks.\nWhen William II died on 2 August 1100, Robert was on his return journey from the Crusade and was about to marry a wealthy young bride to raise funds to buy back his duchy. As a result, his brother Henry was able to seize the crown of England for himself. Upon his return, Robert \u2013 urged by Flambard and several Anglo-Norman barons \u2013 claimed the English crown on the basis of the short-lived agreement of 1087. In 1101, he led an invasion to oust his brother Henry; he landed at Portsmouth with his army but his lack of popular support among the English as well as Robert's own mishandling of the invasion tactics enabled Henry to resist the invasion. Robert was forced by diplomacy to renounce his claim to the English throne in the Treaty of Alton. It is said that Robert was a brilliant field commander but a terrible general in the First Crusade. His government (or misgovernment) of Normandy as well as his failed invasion of England suggests that his military skills were little better than his political skills.\nIn 1105, however, Robert's continual stirring of discord with his brother in England as well as civil disorder in Normandy itself prompted Henry to invade Normandy. Orderic reports on an incident at Easter 1105 when Robert was supposed to hear a sermon by the venerable Serlo, Bishop of S\u00e9es. Robert spent the night before sporting with harlots and jesters and while he lay in bed sleeping off his drunkenness his unworthy friends stole his clothes. He awoke to find himself naked and had to remain in bed and missed the sermon.\nIn 1106, Henry defeated Robert's army decisively at the Battle of Tinchebray and claimed Normandy as a possession of the English crown, a situation that endured for almost a century. Captured after the battle, Robert was imprisoned in Devizes Castle for twenty years before being moved to Cardiff.\nIn 1134, Robert died in Cardiff Castle in his early eighties. Robert Curthose, sometime Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the Conqueror, was buried in the abbey church of St. Peter in Gloucester. The exact place of his burial is difficult to establish \u2013 legend states that he requested to be buried before the High Altar. His effigy carved in bog oak, however, lies on a mortuary chest decorated with the attributed arms of the Nine Worthies (missing one \u2013 Joshua, and replaced with the arms of Edward the Confessor). The effigy dates from about 100 years after his death and the mortuary chest much later. The church subsequently has become Gloucester Cathedral.\nFamily.\nRobert married Sybilla of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey of Brindisi, Count of Conversano (and a grandniece of Robert Guiscard, another Norman duke) on the way back from Crusade, one child:\nRobert also had at least three illegitimate children:"}

It was fought on April 6 and April 7, 1862, in Tennessee. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.\nBackground.\nThe Union Army of the Tennessee was commanded by Ulysses S. Grant. Grant had captured Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in western Tennessee during the early months of 1862. This forced the Confederate Army to leave Kentucky, western Tennessee, and central Tennessee.\nGrant wanted to capture the city of Corinth, Mississippi, next. But his superior, Henry W. Halleck, didn't want Grant to go any further south until other Union soldiers joined him. So Grant moved his army to a place called Pittsburg Landing, which was on the Tennessee River. There was a church near the landing called Shiloh Church. His army stayed there for several weeks.\nGeneral Albert Sidney Johnston commanded the Confederates. Johnston's second-in-command was P. G. T. Beauregard. Beauregard came up with a plan to recapture western Tennessee. Confederate soldiers from all over the Western theater gathered in Corinth. Then, starting on April 3rd, they marched north toward Grant's army. The Confederate Army was ready to attack on the morning of the 6th.\nThe Battle.\nThe battle started around dawn on April 6th. The Confederates surprised the Union Army. After fighting all day, Grant's army retreated back to Pittsburg Landing. Johnston was killed during the battle, and Beauregard took over the Confederate Army.\nMore Union soldiers arrived at the battlefield during the night. They were part of the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Don Carlos Buell.\nGrant attacked the Confederates the next morning. The two armies fought all morning and during the afternoon. By 4\u00a0p.m., Beauregard decided to retreat back to Corinth.\nAftermath.\nThe Confederates lost 10,698 casualties during the battle. Union soldiers buried the Confederate dead on the battlefield. The Union Army lost about 14,500 casualties during the battle."}

In 911, a group of Vikings lead by Rollo Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to try to reach an agreement with Rollo. The talks were led by Herv\u00e9, the Archbishop of Reims. The result was the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. The treaty granted Rollo all land between the river Epte and the sea in exchange for his fealty. In addition, the treaty granted Rollo Brittany \"for his \". At the time, Brittany was an independent region which France had not been able to control. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty, which involved military assistance for the protection of the kingdom. As a token of his good will, Rollo also agreed to be baptised and marry Gisela a daughter of king Charles.\nThe territory covered by the treaty is nearly the same as today\u2019s Upper Normandy down to the Seine river. It would later extend west beyond the Seine to form the Duchy of Normandy, named for the northmen who ruled it. The treaty was entered into after the death of Alan I, King of Brittany and at the time another group of Vikings occupied Brittany. Around 937 Alan I's son, Alan II returned from England to expel those Vikings from Brittany. This happened in 939.

His \"Clito\" was a Latin term meaning the same as the Anglo-Saxon \"\". Both \"Clito\" and \"Atheling\" signified a \"man of royal blood\", or the modern term \"prince\".\nHistory and family.\nYouth.\nWilliam was the son of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, and his wife Sybilla of Conversano. She was the daughter of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano (in southern Italy). His father, the Duke of Normandy was defeated and captured by his brother Henry I of England at the Battle of Tinchebrai in (1106). Robert Curthose went with Henry I to Falaise where Henry met his nephew the young William Clito for the first time. Henry placed his nephew in the custody of Helias of Saint Saens, Count of Arques. Helias had married a daughter of Duke Robert, his friend and lord. The boy William stayed under the care of Helias until August 1110. At that time the king suddenly sent agents to demand the boy be handed over to him. At the time Helias was away from home. But his servants hid the boy and smuggled him to their master. Helias fled to safety among Henry's enemies.\nFirst Norman Rebellion, 1118\u201319.\nWilliam\u2019s first refuge was with King Henry\u2019s great enemy, Robert de Bell\u00eame, who had extensive lands south of Normandy. When Robert of Bell\u00eame was captured in 1112, William and Helias fled to the court of the young Count Baldwin VII of Flanders who was another of William\u2019s cousins. In 1118 a number of Norman counts and barons were tired enough of King Henry to ally with Count Baldwin. They took up William Clito\u2019s cause and started a dangerous rebellion.\nThe Norman border counts and Count Baldwin were too powerful for the king to fight. They seized much of the north part of Normandy. But the campaign quickly ended when count Baldwin was injured at the siege of Arques (September 1118). The next year the cause of William Clito was taken up by Louis VI of France. He invaded Normandy down the river Seine. On 20 August 1119 the French king was met by the troops of King Henry at the Battle of Br\u00e9mule. Louis and his army were defeated. \nWilliam Clito was riding as a knight with the French king\u2019s guard that day. He narrowly escaped capture when the French lost the battle. The next day his cousin, King Henry\u2019s son, William Adelin, sent him back the horse he had lost in the battle with other \"necessities\" as a matter of chivalry. The rebellion collapsed, but the French king continued to support him. Louis brought his case to the pope\u2019s attention in October 1119 at Reims, and forced Henry I to give reasons for his harsh treatment of the exiled boy.\nSecond Norman Rebellion, 1123\u201324.\nOn 25 November 1120 tragedy struck Henry I of England. His son, William Adelin was among the nobles who drowned when the White ship sunk in the English Channel. The loss of King Henry\u2019s only legitimate son, changed William Clito\u2019s fortunes. He was now the obvious male heir to England and Normandy. A significant party of Norman nobles took up his cause. Henry's problems became worse. His his son William Adelin had been promised in marriage to Matilda of Anjou, the daughter of Count Fulk V of Anjou. Fulk now wanted her dowry, including several castles and towns in Maine, returned. But Henry flatly refused. Fulk then promised his daughter Sibylla to William Clito, giving him the county of Maine as her dowry. King Henry then appealed to canon (Church) law and the marriage was eventually (not legal) in August 1124. The William and Sibylla were too closely related under Church laws of the time to be married.\nIn the meantime, a serious rebellion broke out in Normandy in favour of William Clito. But this was defeated by Henry\u2019s spy network. There was also very little organization among the leaders. They were defeated at the battle of Bourgtheroulde in March 1124. Henry I also got his son-in-law, the Emperor Henry V, to threaten Louis from the east. This kept king Louis VI distracted so he could not offer help.\nCount of Flanders.\nIn 1127, Louis VI was able to make great efforts to help William\u2019s cause. In January he gave him the royal lands in the French Vexin as a base to attack down the Seine into Normandy. Also he married the French queen\u2019s Joanna of Montferrat. The murder of Count Charles the Good of Flanders on 2 March 1127 gave King Louis a good chance to further William\u2019s fortunes. The king marched into Flanders at the head of an army and on 30 March got the barons of the province to accept William as their new count.\nWilliam started out very well as count. By the end of May he had most of the county cooperating with him. But English money and a new rival, Thierry of Alsace, led to a weakening of his position. In February 1128 Saint-Omer and Ghent said they would no longer accept him as their count. Bruges did the same in March. In May 1128 Lille too welcomed Thierry. This left William controlling little more than the southern fringe of Flanders. However, he struck back at Bruges. In the battle of Axspoele south of the town on 21 June, William with his Norman knights and French allies defeated Thierry. \nAt this point William was joined by his , Duke Godfrey of Brabant. Together their armies besieged Aalst on 12 July. But during the course of the siege William was wounded in the arm in a scuffle with a foot soldier. The wound became and William died at the age of twenty-five on 28 July 1128. His faithful , Helias of Saint Saens, was there with him. William\u2019s body was carried to the abbey of St Bertin in St Omer and buried there. He left no children and was survived by his father, a prisoner of Henry I, who died six years later."}

He was the Duke of Normandy from 1144. By his marriage to the Empress Matilda, daughter and heiress of Henry I of England, Geoffrey had a son, Henry Curtmantle, who succeeded to the English throne. Geoffrey was the founder of the House of Plantagenet, so named for his nickname.\nEarly career.\nGeoffrey was the elder son of Fulk V, King of Jerusalem and his wife Ermengarde of Maine. She was the daughter of Elias I of Maine. Geoffrey, born 24 August 1113, was named after his great-grandfather Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00e2tinais. He received his nickname, Plantagenet, from the yellow sprig of broom blossom (\"gen\u00eat\" is the French name for the \"planta genista\", or broom shrub) he wore in his hat. King Henry I of England sent his royal to Anjou to arrange a marriage between Geoffrey and his daughter, Matilda. Consent was given by both parties. On 10 June 1128 King Henry I knighted the fifteen-year-old Geoffrey.\nMarriage.\nIn 1128 Geoffrey married Empress Matilda, the daughter and heiress of King Henry I of England and widow of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage was meant to seal a peace between England/Normandy and Anjou. She was about eleven years older than Geoffrey, and very proud of her status as an Empress (as opposed to being a mere Countess). Their marriage was a stormy one with frequent long separations, but she bore him three sons and survived him.\nCount of Anjou.\nThe year after the marriage Geoffrey's father left for Jerusalem to marry the heiress of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Geoffrey became the sole count of Anjou. When King Henry I died in 1135, Matilda at once entered Normandy to claim her inheritance. The border districts submitted to her, but England chose her cousin Stephen of Blois for its king, and Normandy soon followed suit. The following year, Geoffrey gave Ambrieres, Gorron, and Chatilon-sur-Colmont to Juhel de Mayenne, on condition that he help obtain the inheritance of Geoffrey's wife. In 1139 Matilda landed in England with 140 knights, where she was besieged at Arundel Castle by King Stephen. In the \"Anarchy\" which ensued, Stephen was captured at Lincoln in February, 1141, and imprisoned at Bristol. A legatine council of the English church held at Winchester in April 1141 declared Stephen deposed and proclaimed Matilda \"Lady of the English\". Stephen was subsequently released from prison and had himself recrowned on the anniversary of his first coronation.\nDuring 1142 and 1143, Geoffrey secured all of Normandy west and south of the Seine, and, on 14 January 1144, he crossed the Seine and entered Rouen. He assumed the title of Duke of Normandy in the summer of 1144. In 1144, he founded an Augustine priory at Chateau-l'Ermitage in Anjou. Geoffrey held the duchy until 1149, when he and Matilda conjointly ceded it to their son, Henry, which cession was formally ratified by King Louis VII of France the following year.\nGeoffrey also put down three baronial rebellions in Anjou, in 1129, 1135, and 1145\u20131151. He was often at odds with his younger brother, Elias, whom he had imprisoned until 1151. The threat of rebellion slowed his progress in Normandy, and is one reason he could not intervene in England. In 1153, the Treaty of Wallingford allowed Stephen should remain King of England for life and that Henry, the son of Geoffrey and Matilda should succeed him.\nDeath.\nGeoffrey died suddenly on 7 September 1151. According to John of Marmoutier, Geoffrey was returning from a royal council when he was stricken with fever. He arrived at Ch\u00e2teau-du-Loir, collapsed on a couch, made bequests of gifts and charities, and died. He was buried at St. Julien's Cathedral in Le Mans France.\nChildren.\nGeoffrey and Matilda's children were:\nGeoffrey also had illegitimate children by an unknown mistress (or mistresses): Hamelin; Emme, who married Dafydd Ab Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales; and Mary, who became a nun and Abbess of Shaftesbury and who may be the poetess Marie de France. Adelaide of Angers is sometimes sourced as being the mother of Hamelin."}

He was nicknamed Adelin meaning crown prince as he was the heir apparent to the throne. Henry of Huntingdon said of young William that he was full of pride and was arrogant. The historian William of Malmesbury quotes him as saying of the English: \"if he came to reign over them, he would make them draw the plough like oxen.\" Henry arranged a marriage for his young son to Matilda of Anjou. She was the eldest daughter of Count Fulk V of Anjou in February 1113 near Alen\u00e7on. But Fulk agreed to this without the permission of the king of France.\nDuke of Normandy.\nDuring king Henry I's lifetime William was invested by Henry as Duke of Normandy. But this was a title he held more in name than practice. Henry made William the duke when he was pressed by the king of France, Louis VI, to pledge his fealty. Henry as a king himself thought this was beneath him so in 1115 he offered to have William do this in his place. The offer was at first refused. But later Louis after a period of war Louis accepted him. William did homage to Louis VI in the middle of 1120. \nWilliam's mother Queen Matilda served as Henry's in England while he was away in Normandy. After her death in 1118 William was old enough to serve as regent which he did for a year. It is clear that a group of Henry's advisors were there to help both Matilda and William.\nIn 1119, William and Matilda of Anjou married. The ceremony took place in June at the cathedral of Lisieux. The lordship of Maine was to be Matilda's dowry.\nDeath.\nWilliam died in the White Ship tragedy of 25 November 1120. The \"White Ship\" was a newer vessel and her captain was Thomas FitzStephen. He offered to let Henry I of England use it to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy. Henry had already arranged his passage but allowed his son William Adelin and many other nobles to use the White Ship. \nAccording to Orderic Vitalis William Adelin and his friends were drinking liberally and allowed the ship's crew to have drink also. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board. Told to overtake the king's ship the captain set sail after dark. But the ship soon hit a rock in the harbor and quickly sank. William Adelin got into a small to escape but turned back to help his half-sister, Matilda, Countess of Perche. When others tried to climb into the boat it was swamped and sank. William and all of his companions died.\nWilliam's wife was on another ship at the time of the disaster, and survived him. Henry I kept her in England in hopes of marrying her to a nobleman. He wanted to control the county of Maine through her. But her father returned from Jerusalem a year later. He demanded she be returned to Anjou. But Henry refused. Eventually Henry sent her home. She returned to Anjou where she became a nun. Eventually she became Abbess of Fontevrault.\nAftermath.\nThe sinking of the White ship was tremendous loss for Henry. His only son and heir was lost. Several of Henry's illegitimate children were lost as well. The remaining 300 who drowned were among the richest and best known of the nobility of the day. It was the worst maritime disaster of the Middle Ages. \nWilliam Adelin's body was never found meaning there could be no funeral and no tomb. Henry's good fortune took a turn for the worse. Since William Adelin had died and his wife eventually returned to Anjou, Henry's alliance with her father was now cancelled. Henry quickly remarried to Adeliza, the daughter of Godfrey, Duke of Brabant. Although still a teenager she became a popular queen. Even so they never had any children so Henry's attempt to have a male heir to succeed him died with William Adelin."}

Sitting on a black slate rock was the Roman of Angers. It guarded the rivers Mayenne and Loire that flowed around it.\nThe founder or first count of Anjou was Ingelger.\nAnjou became a part of England from 1151-1199, when Henry II inherited the county. He became the Count of Anjou in addition to his other titles. His (third) son Richard the Lionheart became count after his father. At the peak of its power the Angevin Empire spread from Ulster to the Pyrenees. Richard had no legitimate issue, so in 1199 Anjou passed to his nephew, Arthur of Brittany. He was the son of Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany. The Crown of England passed to Henry II\u2019s fifth son and Richard\u2019s youngest brother, John. Arthur was taken prisoner by King John in 1203 and was never seen again. In 1204, Anjou was taken back by Philip II of France. It was later elevated to a duchy for Prince Louis, the second son of John II of France. It remained a duchy until the French Revolution.

It is used to talk about vector spaces. Each vector space has a null vector. This vector is expressed as a linear combination (a sum) of other vectors. A set of these vectors is called \"linearly independent\" if and only if all of them are needed to express this null vector. This is equivalent to saying that at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. If the vectors are not linearly independent, they are called \"linearly dependent\".\nAs an example, take the three-dimensional Euclidean space:\nHere the first three vectors are linearly independent; but the fourth vector equals nine times the first plus five times the second plus four times the third, so the four vectors together are linearly dependent. Linear dependence is a property of the family, not of any particular vector; for example in this case we could just as well write the first vector as a linear combination of the last three."}

It was fought from August 28 to August 30, 1862. It ended in a Confederate victory.\nBackground.\nUnion president Abraham Lincoln formed the Army of Virginia near Washington, D.C. in July 1862. He put Major General John Pope in command of the army. Lincoln wanted Pope to attack the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia.\nConfederate General Robert E. Lee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. He was trying to protect Richmond from another Union army on the Peninsula. The Union Army of the Potomac had just tried to capture Richmond a few weeks before but failed. Lee would be outnumbered if the two Union armies united. He moved his army north to fight Pope.\nThe battle.\nLee planned to send Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's corps to the rear of Pope's army. He wanted to surround Pope. Jackson camped near the Bull Run on August 28, where the First Battle of Bull Run was fought in 1861. Jackson attacked part of Pope's army on August 28 but was defeated.\nPope then tried to attack Jackson on August 29 and destroy his corps. All of the Union attacks failed. Lee arrived during the evening with James Longstreet's corps.\nPope tried to attack Jackson again on August 30 but again was defeated. Lee then attacked Pope and routed the Union army.\nAftermath.\nThere were 13,826 Union casualties in the battle. Pope retreated back to Washington. His army was combined with the Army of the Potomac. Pope was sent to Minnesota after the battle.\nThere were 8,353 Confederate casualties in the battle. Lee decided to invade Maryland after the battle."}

A viscount usually ranks above a baron and below a count. The female equivalent is a Viscountess.\nHistory.\nIn France and Western Europe.\nBeginning in the early ninth century the Carolingian kings appointed counts to run local county governments. The counts used viscounts or deputy counts to assist them.\nThe viscounts served as deputies of the county. They had military, financial, administrative and judicial authority. They carried out court orders and held courts of their own. Viscounts also collected money for the king. Starting with the reign of Philip the Fair they were paid regular salaries. In the early tenth century, viscounts in the south of France gave themselves the rights of counts for their own profit. In Narbonne and Nimes the office became just like that of a count. Elsewhere in France viscounts began replacing counts where they could. A Viscounty (or Viscountship) was the office, area or jurisdiction of a viscount. By the eleventh century viscounts had become hereditary offices in most of Western Europe. In Normandy, before 1066, Duke William I began to view the position of a viscount as being . After 1066, and as King of England, William made several of his viscounts in Normandy, earls in England (an English earl was about the same as a count in Europe). But there were no viscounts in the English peerage and he did not create any.\nIn eleventh century Italy, the office and the lands of a viscount began to be thought of as the hereditary property of the family. The title, as with that of count or marquis was used by all members of a family.\nIn England.\nThe first introduction of the title of viscount in England was in the fifteenth century. The first to be recognized, John Beaumont was already a viscount in Maine. This was to give him a rank above the barons in the English peerage. Afterward it became a regular rank in the peerage. In England, and later in the United Kingdom, a viscount ranks above a baron but below an earl. The wife of a viscount is called a countess."}

He was the first indigenous Australian to win a world title. Rose was ranked as a bantamweight boxer. This is a class for boxers who weigh between .\nChildhood.\nRose was born and raised in Victoria. He was born at Jacksons Track, and lived in the town of Warragul. Rose had a difficult childhood. He learned to box from his father, Roy. Roy was a skilled fighter who competed in local house shows. At the age of 10, Rose was given a pair of gloves by his teacher, Ian Hawkins. When he was about 15, he began to be taught by Frank Oakes, a trainer in Warragul. Rose later married Frank's daughter, Jenny Oakes.\nIn 1970, at the age of 15, Rose won the Australian amateur flyweight title.\nCareer.\nAustralian title.\nRose competed in his first professional boxing match on 9 September 1964. He won against Mario Magriss over eight rounds. This fight was in Warragul, but most of Rose's fights were held in Melbourne. Along the way he was helped by Jack and Shirley Rennie. He stayed in their home in Melbourne, training each day in their backyard.\nRose won his first five matches. After this, he was rematched with Singtong Por Tor, whom he had previously beaten in a 12-round decision. They fought this rematch on 23 July 1965. Por Tor won in six rounds by earning more points than Rose. This was Rose's first defeat. On 14 October 1965, he had his first fight outside Australia. He fought Laurie Ny in Christchurch, New Zealand. Rose beat Ny in 10 rounds.\nOf his next nine fights, Rose won eight. He scored one knockout. The one match he lost in those nine fights was to Ray Perez. On 28 October 1966, he fought for the Australian bantamweight title against Noel Kunde in Melbourne. He won the title by defeating Kunde in a 15-round decision. By winning in this match, Rose became the Australian bantamweight champion.\nWorld title.\nRose won one more belt in 1966 and eight in 1967. He defended his Australian championship against Rocky Gattellari, winning by knockout in the 13th round of the match. After this, Rose challenged Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight championship on 26 February 1968 in Tokyo. He beat Harada in a 15-round decision. This win made him the first Aboriginal Australian to be a world-champion boxer. It made Rose a national hero in Australia, particularly among Aboriginal Australians. He was awarded Australian of the Year for 1968.\nOn 2 July of that year, Rose returned to Tokyo to defend his title against Takao Sakurai. He beat Sakurai with a 15-round decision. On 6 December, he fought against Chucho Castillo in Inglewood, California. Rose beat Castillo by decision, but the verdicts in favour of him made many in the crowd angry, as they supported Castillo. A riot began, the referee and 14 fans were injured.\nOn 8 March 1969, Rose fought against Alan Rudkin. Rose won in a 15-round decision, and kept the championship. Five months later, he returned to Inglewood, where he faced Rub\u00e9n Olivares on 22 August. Olivares knocked out Rose in the fifth round, and so Rose lost the world bantamweight title.\nLater career.\nRose continued boxing after his defeat against Olivares. However, after he lost several fights against boxers who were not very well known, many believed his career as a prime fighter was over. On 10 October 1970, he beat future world lightweight champion Itshimatsu Suzuki in a 10-round decision. Once again, he became a world title challenger, but in the lightweight division.\nRose lost to Jeff White for the Australian lightweight championship. He then fought against world junior lightweight champion Yoshiaki Numata, on 30 May 1971 in Hiroshima. Numata beat Rose by a 15-round decision. Rose announced his retirement soon after.\nDuring his break from boxing in the 1970s, Rose begun a modest career as a singer. He had a few songs that were successful in Australia, such as \"I Thank You\" and \"Please Remember Me\" in 1970. The song \"I Thank You\" was one of the most successful singles in Australia in 1970. It was played instead of the Australian National Anthem during radio broadcasts of the Rugby League State of Origin.\nRose came back to boxing in 1975. However, after losing four of his six matches, including one against Rafael Lim\u00f3n, he decided to retire forever. As a professional boxer, Rose had a record of 42 wins and 11 losses, with 12 wins by knockout.\nRetirement.\nAfter boxing, Rose became a successful businessman. A television miniseries called \"Rose Against the Odds\" (1991) was made about Rose's life story. It starred Paul Williams and Telly Savalas. It was released as a full-length movie in 1995. Melbourne filmmaker Eddie Martin premiered his feature-length documentary \"Lionel\" at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2008.\nRose was one of the original boxers to be inducted into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003.\nIn 2007, Rose suffered a stroke. It left him unable to speak and move very well. He died on 8 May 2011, after an illness which lasted for several months."}

Morphos range in wingspan from the 7.5\u00a0cm (3\u00a0inch) \"M. rhodopteron\" to the imposing 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0inch) Sunset Morpho, \"M. hecuba\".\nColours.\nMany Morpho butterflies are coloured in metallic, shimmering shades of blue and green. These colours are not caused by pigment. They are an example of iridescence: light reflects through the microscopic scales covering the Morpho's wings.\nSexual dimorphism.\nThe blue Morpho species have sexual dimorphism. In some species only the males are iridescent blue, the females are camouflaged brown and yellow. In other species the females are partially iridescent but less blue than the males.\nBiology.\nHabitat.\nTheir habitat is the primary forests of the Amazon and Atlantic. They can breed in other forested habitats, for instance the dry deciduous woodlands of Nicaragua and in secondary forests.\nFlight.\nMorphos are strong fliers, found at altitudes between sea level and about 1400\u00a0m. Morphos are diurnal: males spend the mornings patrolling along forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and will chase any rivals. Morphos typically live alone out of the mating season.\nProtection.\nThe adults are usually palatable, but hard to catch because they are such strong fliers. Birds find it very hard to catch them.\nThe conspicuous blue coloration shared by most \"Morpho\" species may be a case of M\u00fcllerian mimicry, or may be 'pursuit aposematism'. This means the bird learns that the colour says, in effect, \"don't waste your energy, you can't catch me\".\nLife cycle.\nThe entire life cycle of the Morpho butterfly, from egg to death, is approximately 115 days.\nAlthough the adults are palatable, the larvae are not. Their hairs are irritating, and when disturbed they secrete a noxious fluid which smells like rancid butter. The strong odour is a defence against predators.\nThe caterpillar will molt five times before entering the pupal stage. The bulbous chrysalis is pale-green or jade-green and emits a repulsive, ultrasonic sound when touched. It is suspended from a stem or leaf of the foodplant."}

The Center was finished in 1996 to replace the Spectrum as the home arena of the Flyers, 76ers, and Wings. It was built on the former site of John F. Kennedy Stadium (originally Philadelphia Municipal Stadium). The cost of it was $210 million, and it was mostly privately financed (though the city and state helped to pay for the local infrastructure). It is owned by Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Flyers. Global Spectrum operates the arena.

The new scoreboard, manufactured by ANC Sports is like other scoreboards in new NBA &amp; NHL arenas. Another linear LED display lining the entire arena was also added between the suite and mezzanine levels. Other renovations for the Center's ten-year anniversary included upgrading the suites with more flat screen TV's, as well as changing ticket providers from Ticketmaster to New Era Tickets, which is owned by Comcast Spectacor.\nThe PA announcer at the Center for Flyers games is Lou Nolan, who moved with the team from the Spectrum, where he has worked since 1972.

Castor and Pollux were changed into the constellation called Gemini. Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, was the father of Castor, which made Castor mortal, while Zeus was the father of Pollux which made him a demigod.\nZeus seduced Leda as a swan and she laid four eggs, these eggs hatched and four children were born to Leda, the two brothers Castor and Pollux, and two sisters, Helen and Clytemnestra; Castor and Clytemnestra were considered to be the children of King Tyndareus, Pollux and Helen were the demigod offspring of Zeus.\nCastor and Pollux are universally named among the Argonauts, the crew of the Argo who sailed for Colchis with Jason. During the quest for the Golden Fleece, Pollux is noted for having bested the King of Bebryces during a boxing match.\nOne of the best-known myths with Castor and Pollux is how they became a constellation. During a battle Castor, being mortal was killed. Heartbroken at the death of his brother, Pollux prayed to Zeus to make Castor immortal which meant Pollux would have to give up half of his immortality. Eventually, Zeus agreed to the request, and so Castor and Pollux were transformed into the Gemini constellation. To balance the cosmos, the Dioscuri would only be on Olympus one half of the year, and the other six months would be spent in the Underworld in the Elysium fields.\nThey became the gods of sailing and horsemanship. ... Pollux and Castor were also known for their boxing abilities and were thus the gods of athletes and athletic competitions. In both art and literature, Pollux and his brother were shown with horses, as the two were famed horsemen."}

He greatly increased the power and influence of Anjou.\nCareer.\nGeoffrey was the oldest son of Fulk II of Anjou and his first wife Gerberga.&lt;ref name=\"ESIII/4-116\"&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, \"Europ\u00e4ische Stammtafeln|Europ\u00e4ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ\u00e4ischen Staaten\", Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 1 (J. A. Stargardt, Marburg, Germany, 1984), Tafel 116&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded his father as Count of Anjou about 960. Geoffrey married Adele of Meaux (934\u2013982). Adele was the daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy. On her mother's side she was a granddaughter of king Robert I of France. On her father's side she was a direct descendant of Charlemagne. Her cousin was Hugh Capet, King of the Franks. Through this marriage the Angevins joined the highest ranks of western French nobility. \nGeoffrey started by making his power base the of Angers. Geoffrey carefully placed his loyal followers on lands surrounding the city. This was to protect his own territories. The lands of the abbeys of Saint-Aubin and Saint-Serge in Angers provided revenues for his most faithful men. Geoffrey told both his sons, Fulk and Maurice: \"No house is weak that has many friends. Therefore I you to hold dear those who have been friends.\" Geoffrey used several ways of expanding his power and control. Creating family connections was one way. For example his father had controlled Nantes by marrying the countess. Geoffrey brought Nantes under control by making Count Guerech accept him as overlord. For some time the counts of Maine and the bishops of Le Mans had been fighting among themselves. Geoffrey saw a way to take advantage of the situation. About 971 Geoffrey secured the diocese of Le Mans for his ally and friend Bishop Seinfroy. Then, in 973, Geoffrey arranged the marriage of his daughter Ermengarde-Gerberga to Conan I of Rennes, the count of Maine. But rather than act like an ally Conan began to oppose Geoffrey. In 982 the two met at the first battle of Conquereuil where Geoffrey defeated Conan. \nGeoffrey had influence in Aquitaine through his sister Adelaide-Blanche's first marriage to the powerful baron Stephen, Count of Gevaudan and Forez. After his death the lands were ruled by his widow Adelaide-Blanche. Their sons, Geoffrey's nephews, Pons and Bertrand succeeded as counts there. Geoffrey's niece, Adalmode, married Adelbert, Count of Marche and P\u00e9rigord. In 975 Geoffrey had his brother Guy appointed as the Count and Bishop of Le Puy. In 982 Geoffrey married his now widowed sister Adelaide-Blanche to the fifteen-year-old Louis V of France. The two were crowned King and Queen of Aquitaine. But the two could not get along and the marriage failed. So did Geoffrey's plans to control Aquitaine through his young son-in-law. \nAfter the death of his first wife Adele, Geoffrey married secondly Adelaise de Ch\u00e2lon. By this marriage he exerted control over the county of Ch\u00e2lons. Through the marriage of his son, Fulk III, to Elisabeth the heiress of Vend\u00f4me Geoffrey brought that county under his influence. Geoffrey made his son Fulk Nerra his co-ruler just before he died while attacking the fortress of Marcon on 21 July 987.\nFamily.\nHe married Adele of Meaux (934\u2013982), daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy.

It is usually done in coastal areas. Sometimes it is also done in areas like rivers and lakes. Usually, there is a natural process which fills such areas with sand, dirt and other materials. Land reclamation uses the same process, which is sped up. In many cases, this is done using dikes. An example where land reclamation is done is the in the Netherlands.\nPioneer plants, such as Salicornia or grow there. When the level of the land is as high as that of the high tide, new ditches are dug, and the process can repeat.\nSometimes, it is too time-consuming to wait for the land to rise. In that case, it is possible to pump out the water in the enclosed area. This was done in the Netherlands, where many areas are below sea level. The problem with this approach is that it needs to be repeated, for example in the case of heavy rainfall.\nFew examples are Kansai Airport in Osaka, Japan.\nThe creation of large, artificial islands, such as Palm Islands in Dubai or , which is part of the port of Rotterdam is not known as Land reclamation."}

It means passing a decisive point, where one cannot turn back. It comes from a genuine historical incident. The Rubicon is a shallow river in north-east Italy. According to Roman tradition and law Roman legions could not be brought south of the river without permission of the Roman Senate.\nCaesar's civil war.\nIn 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Julius Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor of Gaul had finished. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason.\nCrossing the Rubicon.\nCaesar and his army approached Rome and \"crossed the Rubicon\" in 49 BC. It was the point beyond which no army was supposed to go. The river marked the boundary between Cisalpine Gaul to the north, and Italy proper to the south. Pompey, the lawful Consul, and his friends, fled from Rome as Caesar's army approached. So began a civil war in which Caesar eventually triumphed.\nWhat Caesar reportedly said at the crossing of the Rubicon is \"Alea iacta est\" (\"The die is cast\"). This is yet another metaphor. It comes from gambling with dice: once the die or dice have been thrown, no bets can be withdrawn or added, even before the dice have come to rest."}

He built up Angevin power by building a network of castles. \nEarly career.\nFulk was the son of Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou and Adele of Meaux. He was born about 970. Fulk was born into a of counts going back nearly a hundred years. His father, grandfather, great-grandfather and second great-grandfather had all been counts of Anjou before him. His father, Geoffrey I had been preparing Fulk to be count as he raised him. He was about age seventeen when his father died and Fulk became the next count. Two years earlier, in 985, his father arranged for him to be married to Elizabeth de Vendome, daughter of Bouchard, Count of Vendome. His nickname \"Nerra\" meant 'the Black'. It was probably given to him after his death.\nCount of Anjou.\nHis first years as count were a constant fight for survival. His western borders and his holdings in Touraine were not secure. His concerns were mainly holding and defending Angevin interests. Fulk also faced opposition from the church. Bishop Renaud of Angers and Guntarius of St. Aubin both thought they could take advantage of an inexperienced young count. They wanted to take back lands they lost to Fulk's father, Geoffrey. But Fulk had a powerful ally in his uncle, Bishop Guy of Le Puy. Guy stepped in and sent the abbot on a pilgrimage and used force against Bishop Renaud.\nFulk fought against Conan I of Rennes at the Battle of Conquereuil on 27 June 992. Even though Conan had lost a battle to Fulk's father years before, he was still a powerful force in the region. Defeating and killing Conan gave Fulk Nerra a reputation as a very capable commander. Fulk then extended his power over Maine and Touraine. \nFulk Nerra had a longstanding rivalry with Odo II, Count of Blois. Hugh Capet, king of France had supported the Angevins against Blois. But king Robert II of France had been married to Bertha, (Odo II's mother) and supported Blois against Anjou. The king opposed Fulk's designs on Touraine and this forced him to pull back to Anjou. When Fulk went to the Holy Land Odo II tried to take advantage. He built three new castles to counter those built by Fulk. When Robert II married again, this time to Constance of Arles, she was Fulk's cousin. Relations between the king and Fulk improved. When Count Hugh of Beauvais, a favorite of King Robert, began speaking against his new wife Constance, Fulk had him killed. This turned the king and the church against Fulk. To ask forgiveness, Fulk took a trip to the Holy Land (he made four total). When he returned he built a new monastery. The king decided to stay with Constance. He and Fulk reconcilled in Rome in 1016. That same year war broke out between Fulk and Odo II of Blois. Fulk allied with Herbert I, Count of Maine, called Wakedog, and they attacked Tours. Odo II came in response and the two met on 6 July 1016. Although he was knocked off his horse, Herbert Wakedog rescued him. Fulk defeated Odo II at the Battle of Pontlevoy. \nOdo II fell out of favor with king Robert. Robert asked Fulk to help him against Odo II, which he did. In 1026 when Odo II beseiged Montboyau, Fulk Nerra attacked Saumur. Fulk kept Samur while Odo II lost Montboyau. In the later part of his reign Fulk made several gains in the south including much of Poitou and built a castle there to protect his interests.\nIn defending his territory Fulk had a large number of castles and other built. Fulk used these castles both offensively and defensively. Some of his fortresses cut in half the territory of a neighboring lord. Others were used as forward bases for attacking Touraine.\nFulk could be ruthless at times. His treatment of his first wife is an example. When he thought she had committed adultery, he ordered his countess to be executed by burning. They had been married nearly fifteen years when she died. Fulk continued to control Vendome through their daughter, Adele, and her family. In 1028 Fulk and his second wife, Hildegarde, founded the abbey of Le Ronceray. Originally a church dedicated to St. Mary, Hildegard was very active in its rebuilding into an abbey. They gave the abbey many gifts including the forest of Lattay. Fulk died 1 April 1040 while returning from his last pilgrimage.\nFamily.\nFulk's first wife was Elizabeth de Vendome. Together they had a daughter: \nHis second wife was Hildegard of Lorraine. Together they had two children: "}

She is the wife of singer and musician Paul Hewson, known as Bono, from the rock group U2.\nRaised in Raheny, she met her future husband at a young age at Mount Temple Comprehensive School and married him in 1982. She has a degree in politics and sociology from University College Dublin in 1989. The couple have four children together and live at residences in Ireland, France, and the United States. She has inspired several U2 songs, most famously \"Sweetest Thing\".\nEarly life.\nAlison Stewart was born on 23 March 1961,the daughter of Terry and Joy Stewart and the granddaughter of Hector Grey, a well known Dublin trader and shop owner. Alison studied at Mount Temple Comprehensive School where, at the age of twelve, she met Paul Hewson, who was a grade ahead of her.\nMarriage and family.\nShe married Bono on 21 August 1982 in a Church of Ireland ceremony at All Saints Church, Raheny. In debt to U2's label, Island Records, the couple did not have ready funds for a honeymoon, but label head Chris Blackwell gave them use of the Goldeneye estate he owned in Jamaica. At first, the newly married couple shared a small mews house in Howth with the rest of the band. It took her a while to enjoy the band's music, as her own tastes ran toward her father's Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole records.\nCareer as activist.\nIn 1992, Hewson participated in Greenpeace protests against the Sellafield plant for nuclear reprocessing, located across the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England. This involvement led her to become interested in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986.\nSince 1994, Hewson has been a patron of Chernobyl Children's Project International\nCareer as businesswoman.\nIn 2005, Hewson, Bono and designer Rogan Gregory co-founded the Edun fashion label (\"nude\" spelled backwards, to suggest both \"natural\" and the Garden of Eden). It was intended to help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid.\nHewson and U2.\nSongs written by Bono that were at least in part inspired by Ali go back to the earliest period of the band's recording career, with the track \"Another Time, Another Place\" off their 1980 first album, \"Boy\". She helped Bono get through a bad period of writer's block during the lead-up to the 1983 \"War\" album and especially in the lyric composition for \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". She was the inspiration for the personal themes of \"New Year's Day\" on that record as well. The album and the accompanying War Tour brought financial success to the band, and Bono and Ali moved into a three-level, three-room Martello tower in Bray for some years. The group's 1984 song \"Promenade\" reflects both that location and the spiritual aspects of his desire for her.\nThe U2 song \"Sweetest Thing\" was written for Hewson as a gift because Bono forgot her birthday whilst recording with the band during \"The Joshua Tree\" sessions. Originally released as a B-side in 1987, it was later re-recorded and released as a single from the compilation album \"The Best of 1980\u20131990\" in 1998. Hewson agreed to appear in the single's music video as long as all proceeds from it went to Chernobyl Children's Project."}

In the Azores, this lizard is found after involuntary introduction during the 19th century by ship trade between the two archipelagos, but the lizards have never reached the population numbers as in their territory of origin. There is also a small population in the port area of Lisbon, probably accidentally transported in ships carrying bananas, and first found in 1992; a study of 2001 found that the population has remained stable in size since its discovery.\nTaxonomy.\nThe species was named after the French zoologist Louis Antoine Dug\u00e8s (1797\u20131838).\nThe subspecies \"Teira dugesii mauli\" (Mertens, 1938) from the Desertas Islands now is a synonym of \"Teira dugesii dugesii\". \"Atlantolacerta andreanskyi\" (Andreansky's lizard) from Morocco, and \"Scelarcis perspicillata\" (Menorca wall lizard) from Morocco, Algeria and Minorca, were in the genus \"Teira\" but now are in other genera.\nThe species \"Teira dugessii\" presents three subspecies:\nCharacteristics.\nThese lizards can reach in length, although adults have usually between . Their color can vary from light brown to dark gray, but with some of them (usually males) may show other colors, like green, blue and violet. Males can be easily distinguished from females due to the presence of a yellow at the bottom of the hind legs.\nThe females lay two to three groups of eggs annually. And some individuals could live to 16 years or more.\nFood.\nDespite being essentially an insectivorous species, ripe fruits and berries (especially blackberries) are also part of their diet.\nHabitat.\nThis species is generally found in arid areas where the vegetation is not dense. It may also occur in open woodland, areas with rocks and where crops are grown."}

People, planets, computers, and anything else can be influenced either by things in its environment or by things within itself. Things from within itself are indigenous.\nThe Earth is shaped by many geological processes. The forces that make these things happen come from both inside and outside the Earth.\nIn geology, exogenous processes come from forces \"on or above\" the Earth's surface. Processes caused by forces from \"within\" the Earth are endogenous processes. \"Exo\" is a prefix meaning \"out\", and \"endo\" is a prefix meaning \"in\".\nMany exogenous (extraterrestrial) forces are caused by other bodies in the Solar System. For example, the Moon causes tides in the Earth's oceans and other big bodies of water. Impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the Earth. When they strike the Earth, they make craters in the ground.\nThe Sun is the main exogenous influence in the Solar System. It has many effects on Earth. Radiation from the Sun is a main cause of the surface temperature of the Earth, and for the growth of plant life. We are partly shielded from the Sun's solar wind by the Earth's magnetic field. Storms of solar particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer which protects us from ultraviolet radiation. Sometimes we see aurorae, which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles.\nAn example of an exogenous process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion. Erosion is mostly made by precipitation such as rain and snow, and by wind. \nThere are three main endogenous geological processes: folding, faulting and volcanism. They take place mainly along the plate boundaries. These are the zones on the edges of plates. Endogenous processes cause many major landform features."}

{"id": "413506", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=413506", "title": "Tonic immobility", "text": "Tonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis that animals enter, often called animal hypnosis. Its function is not certain. It may be related to mating in certain animals like sharks. It may also be a way of avoiding or deterring predators (playing dead is called thanatosis).\nTonic immobility has also been used for the paralysis that often immobilizes animals, such as rodents or birds, when they feel threatened by a predator. Tonic immobility plays a role in survival if it helps a hunted animal to blend in with its surroundings. \nTonic immobility can be induced without causing any apparent stress to the animal. For example, stroking a particular area of a lobster's shell or focusing a hen's attention on a line on the ground.\nTonic immobility has also been said to occur in humans that are subject to intense trauma, such as rape or sexual assault. Catatonia in humans is a serious psychiatric condition that often involves a state of immobility.\nSharks.\nSome sharks can be placed in a tonic state. The shark remains in this state of paralysis for an average of fifteen minutes before it recovers. Scientists have exploited this phenomenon to study shark behaviour. \nSome sharks go into tonic immobility when they are turned upside down. With tiger sharks 3\u20134 metres (10 to 15 feet) in length, tonic immobility may be achieved by placing hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout approximate to the general area surrounding its eyes. Scientists believe that tonic immobility in sharks may be related to mating, because female sharks seem more responsive than males. During tonic immobility, the dorsal fin(s) straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed.\nGreat White Sharks are not so responsive as other species when tonic immobility has been attempted. In an interesting eye witness case off the coast of California, a female orca was seen holding the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility. It kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate to death. This was the first recorded eye witness case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans. Another case of orcas purposely inducing tonic immobility in fish has been seen with stingrays in New Zealand. In this case, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths, then quickly right themselves, in turn flipping the stingray over, inducing the tonic immobility, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.\nChicken hypnotism.\nA chicken can be \"hypnotized\", or put into a trance, by holding its head down against the ground, and drawing a line along the ground with a stick or a finger, starting at the beak and extending straight outward in front of the chicken. If the chicken is hypnotized in this manner, it will remain immobile for somewhere between 15 seconds and 30 minutes, continuing to stare at the line. One theory is that the trance is caused by fear, which is probably a defensive mechanism intended to feign death, albeit rather poorly.\nThe first known written reference for this method came in 1646, in \"Mirabile Experimentum de Imaginatione Gallinae\" by Athanasius Kircher in Rome. \nMethods.\nAnother hypnosis technique is to hold the chicken face up with its back on the ground, and then run a finger downwards from the chicken's wattles to just above its vent. The chicken's feet are exposed, which facilitates the application of medication for foot mites, etc. Clapping hands or giving the chicken a gentle shove will awaken it.\nOne can also hypnotize a chicken by mimicking how it sleeps with its head under its wing. In this method, hold the bird firmly, placing its head under its wing, then, gently rock the chicken back and forth and set it very carefully on the ground. It should stay in the same position for about 30 seconds. H.B. Gibson, in his book \"Hypnosis: its nature and therapeutic uses\", says the record period for a chicken remaining in hypnosis is 3 hours 47 minutes.\nTrout tickling.\nTrout tickling is the art of rubbing the underbelly of a trout using fingers. If done properly, the trout will go into a trance-like state after a minute or so, and can then easily be thrown onto the nearest bit of dry land.\nTonic immobility as a scientific tool.\nThe rationale for the tonic immobility test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting an anti-predator response \"death feigning\". The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; tonic immobility in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.\nTo induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds. This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built \u2018V\u2019 or \u2018U\u2019-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck. Scientists record behaviours, such as the number of inductions (15 second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the \u2018righting time\u2019. \nTonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens. Hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels. Hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor. Hens transported for longer times are more fearful than those transported for shorter times.\nTonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits.pigs and monkeys."}

Triangular trade usually develops when a region is exporting resources that are not needed in the region from which its main imports come. Instead, the resources are exported to a third region. The routes involved were historically also shaped by the winds and currents during the age of sailing ships.\nThe best-known triangular trading systems were across the Atlantic Ocean, especially the Atlantic slave trade, which lasted from the late 16th to early 19th centuries. During this time, European countries such as Britain, Spain and France had colonies in the Americas and Africa. The ships carrying slaves, crops and manufactured goods between West Africa, the Caribbean and American colonies and the colonial powers in Europe. The use of African slaves was very important to growing colonial cash crops, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to buy African slaves, which were then brought west from Africa to the Americas to work on the crops. The middle passage of the triangular trade refers to the transportation of the slaves to America.\nThe Atlantic economy was tied into the idea of mercantilism, which thought it was a good idea for European countries to have a lot of colonies that traded only with them. Goods that were traded in the Atlantic economy were rum, slaves, sugar, tobacco, gold, spices, fish, lumber and manufactured goods. Triangular trading became less common in the 20th century due to free trade and ships specialized for particular cargoes."}

Many people proposed heliocentrism, such as Aristarchus of Samos from ancient Greece, but Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to think of good reasons why it is true. This was the beginning of modern astronomy.\nBefore Copernicus, most people thought that the Sun and the other planets revolved around the Earth (this was called geocentrism). This is because if you stand on Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. However, when people watched for many years they saw many things that did not make sense if the Earth was the center of the Solar system. For example, sometimes the planets seemed to move back and forth instead of moving around the Earth. Copernicus explained why these things happen in 1543, when he published the book \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (\"On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres\"). This gave his reasons for thinking the Sun was at the center instead.\nOther astronomers who made further advances after Copernicus were Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. For example, Kepler showed that the planets do not orbit in perfect circles, and Galileo built very good telescopes that helped to confirm the heliocentric model.\nCopernicus also thought that the sun was the center of the universe, but we now know that this is incorrect. The Sun is part of the Milky Way galaxy which is one out of billions of galaxies."}

A trance is when a person is conscious, and not sleeping, but is unaware of what is happening around him or her.\nThe term \"trance\" is associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow, religion, and certain kinds of music. It is an \"altered state of consciousness\".\nThere are many efforts to define what a trance is. Some think it is a borderland between normal consciousness and spirituality\nThe most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized, they are in a trance. Conscious, and responding to the hypnotist, the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information.\nAnother common example is the day-dream, where a person's mind drifts across private thoughts. Everyone daydreams, but young children constantly daydream, and have vivid imaginary fantasies. This is entirely normal. In the language of psychology, this kind of temporary separation from one's surroundings is called \"dissociation\". Research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream.\nThere are many examples of trance in religion. African animistic religions, such as that of the Yoruba, feature dances in celebration of the spirits. Under the influence of rhythm and song, a group dances, often for hours at a time. During this time, various members of the group may fall into trances, and some may act as if possessed by one of the spirits being worshiped. States of \"spiritual ecstasy\" are known in most forms of Christian worship. It is a main part of those aspects of religion known as \"mysticism\"."}

These measurements were made using the cosmic microwave background radiation and the expansion of the Universe.\nHistory.\nIn the 1800s, evidence from geology showed that the Earth was at least millions of years old. Later, it was thought that the universe was unchanging. However, in the 1920s, Georges Lema\u00eetre and Edwin Hubble determined that the universe was expanding (see Hubble's law). Although the estimates made using the initial data were low, radioactive dating on Earth could be used to give measurements of 11\u201320 billion years to 13\u201315 billion years. Eventually, scientists were able to make much better measurements using spacecraft."}

He was the last count who was a male line descendant of Ingelger. The countship passed through his sister Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou to her son Geoffrey III.\nEarly career.\nGeoffrey was born 14 October 1006. He was the son of Fulk the Black and Hildegard of Lorraine. As the count of Vendome, Geoffrey married Agnes of Burgundy. About 1038 Geoffrey was asked by Herbert Braco to help him against Gervais, the Bishop of Le Mans. During the short war between them Geoffrey broke his hip. This caused Geoffrey to have to transfer some of his vassals to Bishop Gervais.\nCount of Anjou.\nAt his father's death in 1040 Geoffrey Martel succeeded him. Along with king Henry I of France Geoffrey maintained a war against the count Theobald of Blois. As the power of Blois was reduced the power of Anjou increased. But Geoffrey became too powerful and by the late 1040s the king turned against him. \nAbout 1047 Geoffrey began to look to the north for more land. Geoffrey attacked the castle of Ch\u00e2teau-du-Loir owned by Bishop Gervais. He did not capture the castle but burned some of it. Geoffrey did capture Bishop Gervais who he threw in prison. The Council of Reims in 1049 ordered Geoffrey to release his captive bishop or they would excommunicate him. Even when the pope did excommunicate Geoffrey the following year he would not release the Bishop. \nGeoffrey next acquired the castles of Alen\u00e7on and Domfront on the southern border of Normandy. From there he raided into Normandy. In 1051 Duke William moved against Domfront but was not able to defeat the fortress. William then set up a siege of the castle to force it to surrender. This caused Geoffrey to leave Maine and return to Anjou. \nIn early 1052 a political shift occurred. King Henry I reconciled with Geoffrey Martel and about the same time he turned against Duke William of Normandy. \nIn the same year, 1052, when the count of Maine, Hugh, died Geoffrey took over Maine without a fight. He ruled Maine until his death. Bishop Gervaise finally purchased his freedom from Geoffrey by giving him Ch\u00e2teau-du-Loir and promising not to return to Le Mans. Gervais went to the court of Duke William of Normandy. Another event in 1052 in Normandy would bring King Henry and Count Geoffrey together against William of Normandy. William of Arques, a vassal and relative of Duke William rebelled. In 1053 the king, along with Geoffrey of Anjou entered Normandy to assist William of Arques against Duke William. The duke had laid siege to the castle of Arques. But the relief effort failed and King Henry and count Geoffrey were forced to leave Normandy. In 1054 the King, accompanied by Geoffrey Martel again raided into Normandy. The king's brother, Odo, led a second force which attacked Normandy from the west. Odo's forces were defeated causing the king and count Geoffrey to leave Normandy again. \nIn 1058 Geoffrey was visited by the king in Anjou. The two planned their next attacks on Normandy. In August of that year the two led a combined force into Normandy to pillage and burn what they could. At a crossing of the Dives River their force was caught by the rising tide. Geoffrey and the king were on the other side when the bulk of their army was attacked and defeated by Duke William. All Geoffrey and the king could do was leave Normandy as fast as they could. The king's death in the summer of 1060 and Geoffrey's death in November of that same year ended their wars.\nFamily.\nGeoffrey II's first wife was Agnes of Burgundy, the widow of William V of Aquitaine; she and Geoffrey married in 1032, but had divorced by 1050. \nHis second wife was named Grace. \nHis third wife was Ad\u00e8le, the daughter of a \"Count Odo\" of Blois.\nHis last wife was Adelaide \"La Teutonne\".\nGeoffrey died childless."}

However, their beliefs are selective. Their \"spiritual revolution\" is against the outside world, which the members called \"the System\". After the death of the founder, his widow Karen Zerby became the leader of TFI, taking the title of 'Queen' and 'prophetess.' She married Steve Kelly, an assistant of David Berg whom Berg had chosen as her 'consort' before his death. Steve Kelly took the title of 'King Peter' and became the public face of TFI, speaking in a more public capacity than either David Berg or Karen Zerby.\n'Flirty Fishing'.\nIn 1974, the group began a method of evangelism called Flirty Fishing. This meant using sex to \"show God's love\" and win converts. The method was apparently extremely successful. According to TFI, as a result of Flirty Fishing, \"over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and missionary\".\nThe group encouraged children to have sex with adults and each other. The High Court of Justice, Family Division, in the UK found there to be \"widespread sexual abuse of young children and teenagers by adult members of The Family\". According to data provided by TFI to researcher Bill Bainbridge, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing. Flirty Fishing also resulted in the births of many children, including Karen Zerby's son, Davidito (aka Ricky Rodriguez). He committed suicide after murdering a female member of the cult who had sexually abused him as a toddler. Children born as result of Flirty Fishing were referred to as \"Jesus Babies\". By the end of 1981, more than 300 \"Jesus Babies\" had been born.\nIn his judgment of a child custody court case in England in 1994, after extensive research of COG publications and the testimony of numerous witnesses, Lord Justice Sir Alan Ward said this about Flirty Fishing:\nLater corrections.\nFlirty Fishing was officially abandoned in 1987. After some complaints from people who had been abused as children by adults, a new rule, that sexual interactions should not occur between an adult and a minor, was encouraged and promoted, but not enforced.\nIn March 1989, TF issued a statement which stated that, in \"early 1985\" an urgent memorandum was sent to all of its members \"reminding them that any such activities [adult-child sexual contact] are strictly forbidden within our group\". In January 2005, Claire Borowik, spokesperson for TFI, issued a statement that said, \"Due to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not clearly stated in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances... This was corrected officially in 1986, when any contact between an adult and minor (any person under 21 years of age) was declared an excommunicable offense\"."}

In 1062, when Saintonge was attacked by Count Guy-Geoffrey of Poitou, Geoffrey did nothing to help Fulk and Saintonge was lost. In 1063 the county of Maine was lost to Anjou as well.

In turn the archbishop excommunicated Geoffrey. \nAs the situation in Anjou became worse Fulk argued with his brother Geoffrey.

The old Division of Hunter was to be abolished. Since Hunter is an original Federation electorate, the Australian Electoral Commission's guidelines for redistributions means it has to try and keep the Hunter name.

A continuous signal can be drawn as a wave, or as a combination of several waves. Fourier transforms and Fourier series are among the main tools used for signal analysis. Today, this field has many uses, which also include quantum mechanics and neuroscience. \nIn essence, harmonic analysis looks at locally compact groups. The Lebesgue measure is a way to assign a measurement to a subset of the Euclidean space. For real numbers there is the Haar measure, which can perform this task. This measure allows to use Fourier analysis to model the groups and their properties. \nThe term \"harmonics\" is also related to Eigenvalues, in the case where the frequency of one wave is an integer multiple of the frequency of another wave. This is the case of the harmonics that are used for musical notes. Later the term was generalized."}

It is a sequel to \"Defense of the Ancients\". Dota was originally a player-made map (also know as a mod) in \"\" that proved to be successful with over 5 million active players. When \"Warcraft: Frozen Throne\" game got old, it was hard to make the map. As a result, Valve Corporation, with the help of the original maker (known only as Icefrog) started to develop \"Dota 2\".\nGoal.\nThe game is a hard to learn, hard to master strategy game. You map pick one of the 115 heroes. They're then put to two teams of five: one called the Radiant(Green) and the other, Dire(Red). The map contains three lanes called top, middle and bottom lanes. Usually, the team chooses to go 2-1-2(2 in top, 1 mid and 2 bot). Sometimes, it will be 2-1-1 or 1-1-2 because there will be a roamer. A roamer, as the name applies, goes all over the map where they can help.\n'Creeps' spawn in both sides are called 'Minions' waves. They are controlled by the computer and they will attack the enemy creeps. They will target a hero or a tower if there is no creeps. The creeps are essential into winning the game since they give gold if killed by a hero.\nIn every lane, there are 3 towers. They're named by their tiers with tier 1 being the nearest to the enemies and tier 3 the farthest. You must destroy all the lane's towers before you can damage the barracks. The barracks are behind the tier 3 towers. If you destroy the 'Ranged Barracks' or 'Melee Barracks', the corresponding creeps spawn at the lane will be more powerful. If all 6 barracks get destroyed, all the creeps get boosted to Mega Creeps. Mega creeps are so powerful that an entire wave of them is equal to the power of a hero. If you have mega creeps, you will likely win the game.\nThe winning condition of the game is by destroying the enemy 'Ancient' or base while defending your own. Due to the large map and variety of scenarios,\ngames often last 30\u201350 minutes. Some games go to 2 hours if necessary.\nYou may leave the game before it ends, but you will get punished. Your next 1-5 games will be in a 'Low Priority' form. In low priority, every player gets a pool of only 3 heroes to pick. They can also not play with 'High Priority' players.\nSummary.\nThe game has two different teams with five \"heroes\" on each side. They can choose between 115 different heroes. Players have to get the rivaled towers in order to eventually get to the ancient and destroy it. Through the game, players can gain gold, buy items and of course, get kills and assists.\nNotes.\nYou can also play custom games, which are made by loyal players via the steam workshop. Dota 2 is famous for it's complexity and forceful effort. Some people have earned millions of dollars playing this game in important hostages, most knowingly, the International, which has the biggest money pool in video game history, reaching 13 million in U.S.A dollars."}

It prefers soils with a recent volcanic origin.\nConservation.\n\"Echium vulcanorum\" is used for the production of (dry wood that will be burned) and destroyed by goats, so this species, as well as the other two \"Echium\" species of Cape Verde, is seriously threatened, so that measures for its protection should be taken with urgency.\nSome conservation actions have been done at the \"Bordeira region\" (in the Natural Park of Fogo Island) and now there is a population with a relatively high number of individuals."}

A man who had been fired from the Philippine National Police, Rolando del Rosario Mendoza, boarded a tourist bus in Rizal Park and took the passengers hostages. Nine people (including 8 tourists from Hong Kong, killed by Mendoza, and Mendoza himself) were killed in the incident.\nSince some Hong Kong people blamed the Philippine Government for not handling the incident properly, the relationship between Hong Kong and the Philippines had become much worse.\nBackground.\nMurderer.\nRolando del Rosario Mendoza was formerly a policeman. In 2008, he was fired because of complaints that he forced an arrested chef to admit drug trafficking that he had not done.\nWhen he came aboard the tourist bus, he posted a sticker to the bus stating \"BIG MISTAKE TO CORRECT A BIG WRONG DECISION\".\nTour group.\nThe tour group was held by Hong Thai Travel.

Also, the staff of the funeral house opened the coffins and let journalists take photos. Such events made the Hong Kong people very more angry. Ironically, Mendoza's funeral was held at his home and his coffin was covered by the national flag of the Philippines. This added anger to the people of Hong Kong. A \"netizen\" of Hong Kong even joked that the Philippine flag could be used as doormat.\nThe Philippine Government said that the flag was used improperly.

They build piece of designs through assembling typography and motion graphics(animation). Mainly graphic designers creates graphics for published, printed, or electronic media, such as brochures (sometimes) and advertising usages. Sometimes they are also part of typesetting, illustration, user interface construction and web designs. They are presenting information as accessible and memorable form.\nQualifications.\nAcademic degrees.\nA Bachelor's degree or certificate from accredited trade school is considered as usually essential for the position as a graphic designer. After a career history has been established, though, the graphic designer's experience and number of years in the business are considered the primary qualifications. A portfolio, which is the primary method for demonstrating these qualifications, is usually required to be shown at job interviews, and is constantly developed throughout a designer's career.\nOne can obtain an AAS, BA, BFA, BCA, MFA or an MPhil / PhD in graphic design. Degree programs available vary depending upon the institution. Although typical U.S. graphic design jobs may require at least some form of degree.\nNeeded skills.\nCurrent graphic designer jobs demand proficiency in one or more graphic design software programs. A common software package used in the graphic design industry is Adobe Creative Cloud. This software package contains the three main programs used by graphic designers, which are Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. These are the industry standard applications for many graphic design positions. Another example of a common software package is CorelDraw Graphics Suite.\nOutside the graphic design industry, many people use Microsoft Word or Microsoft Publisher to create a layout or design. However, depending on the job at hand, most designers create the layout in either InDesign, CorelDraw, or QuarkXPress. Specifically, the designer will type or import the text in the layout program, also importing the graphics and images they created in Photoshop or Illustrator. There are a couple of reasons a designer builds a layout in this fashion:\nFiles going to press are generally printed at 300 dots per inch. As a result, the file size can become very large, depending upon the photos and graphics used in it. By using a layout program and linking these graphics and images (but not saving all of them in the file itself), the working file is a fraction of the file size. When the designer is ready to go to press, s/he will either create a press-ready PDF; or use the \"Package\" function in InDesign, or the \"Collect For Output\" function in QuarkXpress or CorelDRAW (which gathers the layout document, plus all fonts and images used therein, and saves them in one folder which can be provided to a commercial printing company for final output).\nInDesign, CorelDRAW, or QuarkXPress make it possible to work with large multiple page layouts, such as catalogs and booklets.\nSince InDesign, CorelDRAW, and QuarkXPress the original file, linking to the graphics and images, the designer can change the \"original file\" and it will update all instances throughout the document to save time.\nA web designer should understand how to work with XML, HTML, and basic web programming scripts. A print designer should understand the processes involved in printing (including, notably, offset printing) to be able to produce press-ready artwork.\nCommunication.\nDesigners should be able to solve visual communication problems or challenges. In doing so, the designer must identify the communications issue, gather and analyze information related to the issue, and generate potential approaches aimed at solving the problem. Iterative prototyping and user testing can be used to determine the success or failure of a visual solution. Approaches to a communications problem are developed in the context of an audience and a media channel. Graphic designers must understand the social and cultural norms of that audience in order to develop visual solutions that are perceived as relevant, understandable and effective.\nRendering methods.\nGraphic designers should also have a thorough understanding of production and rendering methods. Some of the technologies and methods of production are drawing, offset printing, photography, and time-based and interactive media (film, video, computer multimedia). Frequently, designers are also called upon to manage color in different media."}
