The rheumatism led to akylosis of his joints, tendons, and muscles. They turned to bone. Things got worse. In 1869, he lost his eyesight. He had to eat by sucking food up and swallowing it whole. When his mother died in 1872, a brother began taking care of him.\nIn 1887, Bass began his show biz career at Niagara Falls. He then worked his way across the United States. In spite of his disabilities, Bass remained cheerful. He parted with his manager after a dispute about his cut of the take.\nLast years and death.\nBass died of a fever and pneumonia while performing in Huber's Museum in New York City.

There are fountains and a reflecting pool around the Unisphere.\nThe Unisphere was built for the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair. The Unisphere is designed to show countries around the world depending on each other. It stayed at the park after the World's Fair. The Unisphere was cleaned from 1993 to 1994.\nHistory.\nFlushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park used to be a landfill in Queens. The landfill was turned into the 1939/1940 New York World's Fair. After the fair, it was used as a park. The 1964 New York World's Fair also happened at Flushing Meadows. Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano designed the park for 1964 Fair.\nRobert Moses ran the 1964 World's Fair. He announced the Unisphere in February 1961. At first, Clarke designed the Unisphere as an aluminum structure with metal continents and islands. Designers at Peter Muller-Munk Associates added structural steel. The last design was a lot like the first. The last design had fountains surrounding the Unisphere.\nThe Unisphere was built by the American Bridge Company. The American Bridge Company was part of another company called US Steel. The Unisphere was built in 110 days. The last piece of land was put on the Unishphere on August 13, 1963. At night, the Unisphere was lit up to show sunrise moving across the globe. There were lights showing the capitals of countries.\nIn 1966, US Steel gave $100,000 so the Unisphere could stay at the park. In 1967, the park reopened. The Unisphere became dirty afterward. People wrote graffiti in the pools.\nIn 1989, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation said it would clean the Unisphere. From 1993 to 1994, the Unisphere was fixed and cleaned. The fountains were also turned back on. It became an official city landmark in May 1995. The Unisphere's fountain was cleaned again in 2010.\nDesign.\nThe Unisphere is the world's largest globe. It is wide and tall. The globe weighs . Its base weighs . The Unisphere is made of stainless steel. The continents and islands on the Unisphere were made by the Rigidized Metals Corporation. The Unisphere is tilted 23.5 degrees.\nThere are three rings around the Unisphere. They show the orbits of Yuri Gagarin, John Glenn, and the Telstar satellite around the Earth. There were supposed to be more rings, but the designers could not do this. The rings are held up with aircraft cable. The Unisphere's continents and islands are made of many layers of metal sheets. The Unisphere has many latitude and longitude bars of different sizes. This makes the structure stable.\nThere is a reflecting pool around the Unisphere. It measures across. There are 48 fountains in the pool. These fountains are supposed to make the Unisphere look like it is floating in space. There are also plaques around the pool.\nThe Unisphere has a concrete foundation. The ground under the Unisphere used to be a marsh. There are 528 wooden rods under the Unisphere."}

Their mythology involves a set of totemic creation spirits who are said to have formed the world.\nThe Cherokee believe that signs, visions, dreams and powers were all gifts of the spirits. They believe that the real world is intertwined with and presided over by the spirit world.\nCreation beliefs.\nThe creation myth of the Cherokee describes the earth as a great floating island surrounded by an ocean. It hangs from the sky by cords attached at the four cardinal points. The story tells that the first earth came to be when D\u00e2yuni's\u00ef, the little water beetle, came down from the sky world (G\u00e4l\u00fb\u00f1'l\u00e4t\u00ef) to see what was below the water. He paddled over the surface of the water, but found no place to rest. He dived to the bottom of the water and brought up some soft mud. This mud expanded in every direction and became the earth.\nThe other spirits in G\u00e4l\u00fb\u00f1'l\u00e4t\u00ef were eager to come down to the new earth. Firstly, birds were sent to see if the mud was dry. The buzzard was sent ahead to make preparations for the others, but the earth was still soft. When he grew tired, his wings dipped very low and brushed the soft mud, forming mountains and valleys in the flat ground. When the earth was finally dry, all of the animals came down from the sky. It was dark, so they took the Sun and put it in a track to travel east to west. At first, they set it too low and the crawfish was burned. So they elevated the sun several times to reduce its heat.\nThe story tells how several other plants and animals got certain features. They all were told to stay awake for seven nights, but only a few animals such as the owl and panther were able to; and so these two were given the power to see and hunt at night. Only a few trees were able to as well \u2013 the cedar, pine, spruce and laurel \u2013 and so the rest were forced to shed their leaves in the winter.\nThe first people were a brother and sister. The brother hit his sister with a fish and told her to multiply. Following this, she gave birth to a child every seven days. Soon, there were too many people, so women were then forced to have just one child every year.\nVenerated spirits.\nThe Cherokee revere the Great Spirit. She is called Unelanuhi, the sun goddess. She presided over all things when the earth was created, and was said to have made the earth to provide for her children. Unelanuhi is all-seeing, all-knowing and all-powerful. The Wahnenauhi Manuscript says that God is \"Unahlahnauhi\", meaning \"maker of all things\", and \"Kalvlvtiahi\", meaning \"the one who lives above\".\nThe twin Thunder Boys are the sons of Kanati and Selu. They live in the land of the west above the sky. When thunder sounds, the boys are playing ball. The lightning and the rainbow are their beautiful dress. The priests pray to the thunder and he visited the people to bring the rains and blessings from the South. It was believed that the thunder beings who lived close to the Earth's surface, in the cliffs and mountains, and under water falls could and did harm the people at times. These other thunders are always plotting mischief. The thunder beings were viewed as the most powerful of the servants of the Great Spirit. They were revered in the first dance of the Green Corn Ceremony held each year. They were believed to have brought the rains for a successful corn crop.\nEvil.\nThere is no one evil spirit in Cherokee theology. An \"asgina\" is any kind of spirit, but it is usually considered to be a bad spirit. Uya, sometimes called Uyaga is an evil earth spirit which works against the forces of good and what is right. There is also Nun'Yunu'Wi and Kalona Ayeliski, evil spirits who prey on the souls of the dying and would torment their victims until they died.\nAll disease and suffering is traditionally believed to be caused by the spirits or by witchcraft. It was also believed that the plants made medicine to cure each sickness that entered the world. When the medicine man does not know what medicine to use the spirits of the plants tell him."}

It is part of the collection of Thanksgiving Point Institute, and displayed in the North American Museum of Ancient Life at Lehi, Utah. It includes an incomplete skull and mandible (lower jaws) and much of the postcranial skeleton, i.e. the parts behind the head. The size of this specimen suggests a size in life of about 3.3 meters (11 feet) long.\nHabitat.\nThe fossil was found in the Morrison Formation, where originally there was a great variety of life. This environment a savannah with many rivers. Along the rivers were conifer forests, with ginkgos, cycads, tree ferns, and horsetails rushes. \nInsects were very similar to modern species, with termites building 30\u00a0m (100\u00a0ft.) tall nests. Along the rivers, there were fish, frogs, salamanders, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, pterosaurs, crayfish, clams, and monotremes (prototherian mammals, the largest of which was about the size of a rat). The dinosaurs were most likely along the rivers as well. Hundreds of dinosaur fossils have been discovered.\nAccording to radiometric dating, the Morrison Formation dates from 156.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0million years old (mya) at its base, to 146.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mya at the top, so it lasted just under 10 million years.\nPhylogeny.\nCarpenter and his co-workers said that this genus most closely resembles \"Coelurus\", though it has some more \"primitive\" features. Although a 2007 analysis suggested it was a basal Tyrannosaur, later work showed once again its basal position in the Coelurosauria."}

Whenever he tries to take a bath, Cranky another alligator living in the sewers, disrupts the water flow to Swampy's home. Located somewhere on the level is a supply of water, either a limited amount pooled at different locations or an unlimited amount flowing from a pipe.

In many levels, the water must be routed through other pipes or must interact with machines in order to open up a route to the inlet. When the required amount of water reaches the bathtub, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. Also scattered around the level are three rubber ducks that can be collected when they absorb an amount of water. Select levels also include items hidden in the dirt that will unlock bonus levels when three-item collections are completed.\nCertain levels are also populated by hazards that must be avoided or removed. For example, some levels contain algae that will absorb water and grow. Other types of fluids will sometimes appear, such as purple poison/acid, reddish mud, and green ooze/slime. If either poison, ooze or mud reaches the inlet, the level is failed and must be restarted. (Swampy jumps out of the tub if poison/acid enters it, but simply gets surprised or disgusted if ooze/slime or mud enters it instead). If all the water or any fluids that must be converted disappear etc., Swampy cries mournfully as the level restarts too. (only on the free version.) The poison, mud, and the ooze will kill all the rubber ducks (the ducks turn into skulls and make a painful-sounding quack) on contact.\nPoints are awarded for a/the short amount of time taken to complete the level, for collecting rubber ducks and for delivering more than the minimum amount of water to Swampy's tub. Collecting a certain number of rubber ducks will also unlock new groups of levels.\nDevelopment.\n\"Where's My Water?\" was developed by Creature Feep, a team of designers within the Disney Mobile division of Disney Interactive Studios. Creature Feep is headed up by game design director Tim FitzRandolph. In an October 2011 interview, FitzRandolph explained that the goal for the development of \"Where's My Water?\" was \"to contribute a new character to the company, while making a really fun game in the process\".\nThe earliest phase of development centered around the concept of the game, which was players using their fingers to guide water to a goal. In actuality, the water is rendered as lots of individual \"drops\" that interact with each other. At one point the designers had to devise a reason for having a bathtub underground. That reason came from the urban legend of alligators living in city sewers, so the game's lead character became a \"hygiene-conscious alligator\". Unlike many mobile games released by Disney, where characters from the company's films are used, \"Where's My Water?\" represents the first time that Disney has produced an original character for a mobile game. In designing that character, Disney Mobile wanted one \"that felt like it belonged when lined up with other Disney characters\".\nRelease.\n\"Where's My Water?\" came out with four chapters - \"Meet Swampy\", \"Troubled Waters\", \"Under Pressure\" and \"Sink or Swim\" \u2014 each containing 20 levels. New chapters are rolled out with updates, each featuring new gameplay tools and supplies. A version for devices that have the Android operating system was released on the Android Market in North America on November 23, 2011 and included all six chapters available up to that point. A free, ad-supported version of \"Where's My Water?\" was also released to both iOS and Android in December 2011. The free version includes 25 unique levels, plus the ability to unlock five popular levels taken from the main game. In May 2012, a total of 20 levels that originally appeared in the free version were added to the full version, collectively known as \"The Lost Levels\". The levels in question are grouped into two holiday-themed chapters. June 2012 The update also included two new in-app purchases: the \"Mystery Duck\" mode (see below) and Locksmith Duck, which would unlock a chapter without having to collect a certain number of ducks within the main game. In connection, \"Where's My Perry\", a version of the game featuring Perry the Platypus from \"Phineas and Ferb\". On September 19, 2012, a new update brought a special Birthday Level, \"Make a Wish\", to Where's My Water and Swampy's 1 Year Birthday. 10 more Lost Levels were also added for free. An infographic of Where's my Water's history teased a new update with a black-and-white and Frankenweenie-based levels.\nCranky's Story.\nIn January 2012, \"Cranky's Story\", a new subset of levels within the game, was added initially to the iOS version and later to the Android version. The gameplay in \"Cranky's Story\" is basically the same as the main game, in that players must route a fluid to an inlet goal. However, this time the player must help Cranky by bringing the purple poisonous water into his lair to melt algae that is covering his food. This time, the ducks are now purple and can only be collected by being splashed with poison, while other fluids (including clean water) will kill it. If water or any of the other liquids enter the inlet, the level is failed (the water causes Cranky's food to be covered with more algae, surprising him, while ooze will turn it into a rock and being kicked away, the same is true with mud). If all of the poison is lost, then Cranky will get very angry. The first five levels in the first chapter, \"Cranky's First Course\", are free to play, while the rest of the chapter and all of the 2nd chapter, \"Hunger Pains\", are accessible through a one-time in-app purchase. The update also includes \"Cranky's Challenge\", a set of 12 challenges and four bonus stages for the player to accomplish. If those challenges are failed, then Swampy will cry as if you lost all the water. An all new Food Groups and the 3rd episode \"Bulking Up\" were released on April 5, 2012 and adds 6 challenges and two bonus stages. The final episode, \"Overstuffed\", was released on May 18, 2012.\nMystery Duck.\nIn June 2012, a new game mode called \"Mystery Duck\" was introduced. It is a revisit of the levels from the main game except the player has to deal 3 special kinds of ducks. They are:\nLike \"Cranky's Story\", a one-time in-app purchase was required to play beyond the first five levels. On September 19, as part of the Birthday update, 40 more levels were added to Mystery Duck.\nAllie's Story.\nIn May 2013, a new subset of levels called \"Allie's Story\" was added in a May 25 update. The gameplay in this mode is the same as the other modes, but this time, it requires players to direct steam to operate Allie's makeshift pipe organ. Ducks are blue and can only be covered in steam, while other fluids (except clean water) will kill them. If water or other fluids get in the inlet, the level is failed. As with Cranky's Story and Mystery Duck, a one-time in-app purchase is required to play beyond the first five levels.\nChallenges.\nThere are challenges found in many Swampy levels. There are seven basic types:"}

Found along the eastern coast of the Americas, this species is found mainly in coastal waters over beds of seagrass, sandy flats, and shell or coral rubble. The Blacknose shark is quite a small species of shark, with adults reaching a maximum length of 4.6 feet (1.4 metres). This shark gets its name from the black spot on the tip of its snout.\nDescription.\nBlacknose sharks are quite small and slender with a long rounded snout and large eyes. This shark gets it's name from the black spot under the tip of the snout. The Blacknose shark has two dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is located over the free margins of the pectoral fins, and the second dorsal fin is over or slightly infront of the anal fin. The margin of the anal fin is deeply notched. This species does not have an interdorsal ridge (ridge between dorsal fins), and the caudal peduncle doesn't have a keel. \nThe Blacknose shark is grey to greenish grey with black tips on the second dorsal fin and dorsal caudal lobe. The black spot under the tip of the snout makes this shark easy to differ from other shark species which are found in the same region.\nThe upper jaw of the Blacknose shark has 12-13 rows of teeth on each side with 11-12 rows on the lower jaw. Teeth on the upper jaw are quite narrow and triangular with slanting cusps along with rough serrations along the bases than the tips. The lower jaw also has cusped serrated teeth with broad bases. There is one symphysial tooth in the upper jaw and one or two in the lower jaw.\nThe average length of a full-grown Blacknose shark is around 4.1 feet (1.2 metres), reaching a maximum size of 4.6 feet (1.4 metres). This shark usually weighs about 22 pounds (10\u00a0kg) at maturity. The Blacknose shark is quite a fast growing species, with both males and females reaching maturity at the lengths of about 1 metre.\nHabitat.\nThe Blacknose shark is found in the continental and insular shelves off the eastern coast of the Americas, as far north as North Carolina and as far south as southern Brazil, including the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. They around found mainly in coastal waters over beds of seagrass, sandy flats, and shell or coral rubble. This species is found in different areas depending on the size and gender. Usually, only young sharks are encountered in shallow water, as the adults like depths greater than 9 metres (30 feet) and is most common at 18\u201364 metres (59\u2013210 feet). \nBlacknose sharks found off the Atlantic coast of the southern United States migrate northward in the summer and southward in the winter; a similar migration occurs for the Blacknose sharks in the Gulf of Mexico.\nReproduction.\nBlacknose sharks are viviparous, and mate in late May and early June and have a 10-11 month gestation period. Currently, Blacknose sharks seem to have two different reproductive cycles in the Northwestern Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Studies have shown that female Blacknose sharks in the Gulf of Mexico reproduce every year, while females in the Atlantic reproduce once every two years.\nOne litter of Blacknose sharks can contain 3-6 pups, but the usual number is 4. At birth, the young measure 43\u201351\u00a0cm in length. Both genders mature at about 2 years of age. Bulls Bay, South Carolina, United States is one known nursery area for this species.\nFeeding.\nThe Blacknose shark is a quick swimmer, feeding on small fish including pinfish, croakers, porgies, anchovies, spiny boxfish, and porcupine fish. It is also known to feed on octopus.\nHuman interaction.\nBlacknose sharks are of small commercial fishery importance, however it is fished as a gamefish, for the decent fight it gives when caught on light tackle. When it is harvested, this shark is often dried before being marketed for human consumption. This shark poses little threat to humans and has never been reported in a shark attack case. However, when confronted by divers, the Blacknose shark has been reported to give a threat display in the form of a hunched back with head raised and caudal lowered."}

It is part of the province of Ulster. It is also part of the Border Region, as it borders Northern Ireland. It is named after the town of Monaghan. 60,483 people live in the county according to the 2011 census.\nTowns and villages.\nThe main towns and villages are:\nLargest Towns in County Monaghan (2011 Census).\n1. Monaghan - 7,452 people\n2. Carrickmacross - 4,925 people \n3. Castleblayney - 3,634 people \n4. Clones - 1,761 people \n5. Ballybay - 1,461 people\nGeography.\nThere is a lot of countryside in County Monaghan. There are a few mountains like Mullyash Mountain, Slieve Beagh (on the border with Tyrone and Fermanagh) and Coolberrin Hill (214\u00a0m, 702\u00a0ft). Lakes include Lough Egish, Lough Fea, Muckno Lough, Lough Avaghon, Inner Lough (in Dartrey Forest), Drumlona Lough, White Lough and Emy Lough. \nRivers in Monaghan include the River Fane (along the Louth border), the River Glyde (along the Louth and Meath borders), the Ulster Blackwater (along the border with County Tyrone) and the Dromore river (along the border of County Cavan, linking Cootehill to Ballybay). The Ulster Canal runs through Monaghan, but is not fully open to navigation. \nMonaghan has a number of forests, including Rossmore Forest, Dartrey Forest and D\u00fan na R\u00ed Forest Park. Managed by Coillte since 1988, the majority of trees are conifers. Due to a long history of intensive farming and recent intensive forestry practices, only small pockets of native woodland remain.\nHistory.\nIn 1585, the English lord deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot, visited the area and met the Irish chieftains. They wanted Ulster to be divided into counties, and that land in the kingdom of Airg\u00edalla be split up and given to each of the McMahon chiefs. That is how County Monaghan was created. The county was divided into five baronies: Farney, Cremorne, Dartrey, Monaghan and Truagh, which was left under the control of the McKenna chieftains.\nAfter the defeat of the rebellion of Hugh O'Neill, The O'Neill and the Ulster chieftains in 1603, the county was not colonised by the English (\"planted\") like the other counties of Ulster. The lands were instead left in the hands of the native chieftains. In the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the McMahons and their allies joined the general rebellion of Irish Catholics. Following their defeat, some plantation of the county took place with Scottish and English families.\nFamous people from Monaghan.\nCounty Monaghan is the birthplace of the poet and writer Patrick Kavanagh, who based much of his work in the county. Kavanagh is one of the most significant figures in 20th century Irish Poetry. The poems \"Stony Grey Soil\" and \"Shancoduff\" refer to the county. \nGeorge Collie (1904\u201375) is a famous painter from Monaghan. He was born in Carrickmacross and trained at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. \nMonaghan was also the home county of the Irish writer Sir Shane Leslie (1885\u20131971), 3rd Baronet of Glaslough, who lived at Castle Leslie in the north-east corner of the county. He was a Catholic convert, Irish nationalist and first cousin of British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. Leslie became an important literary figure in the early 1900s. He was a close friend of many politicians and writers of the day including the American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896\u20131940), who dedicated his second novel, \"The Beautiful and Damned\", to Leslie. "}

Protestants believe that any baptized believer can become a priest (though denominations can vary depending on the question of gender), and that anyone can talk directly to God. Ordination is not necessarily needed to become a priest, however, the unordained are generally referred to as, \"Preachers,\" and the term \"Pastor\" can be used interchangeably. \nIn contrast, Roman Catholics believe that only male believers can become priests and that they must receive special training because they between God and His people. Pope Paul VI in 1964 issued a called : In it, he stated the position the Roman Catholic church held after the Second Vatican Council:\nChrist the Lord, High Priest taken from among men, made the new people \"a kingdom and priests to God the Father\".The baptized, by regeneration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, are consecrated (..) a holy priesthood, in order that through all those works which are those of the Christian man they may offer spiritual sacrifices and proclaim the power of Him who has called them out of darkness into His marvelous light.\nHistory.\nThe first person who spoke about this was Martin Luther. Luther did not use the exact phrase \"priesthood of all believers\". He says that there is a general priesthood in Christendom in his 1520 \"To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\". In this text, he also dismisses the medieval view that Christians in the present life were to be divided into two classes: \"spiritual\" and \"secular\". He put forward the doctrine that all baptized Christians are \"priests\" and \"spiritual\" in the sight of God:\nThat the pope or bishop (..) dresses differently from the laity, may make a hypocrite or an idolatrous oil-painted icon, but it in no way makes a Christian or spiritual human being. In fact, we are all consecrated priests through Baptism, as St. Peter in 1 Peter 2[:9] says, \"You are a royal priesthood and a priestly kingdom,\" and Revelation [5:10], \"Through your blood you have made us into priests and kings.\"\nTwo months later Luther wrote in his \"On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church\" (1520):\nHow then if they are forced to admit that we are all equally priests, as many of us as are baptized, and by this way we truly are; while to them is committed only the Ministry (\"ministerium Predigtamt\") and consented to by us (\"nostro consensu\")? If they recognize this they would know that they have no right to exercise power over us (\"ius imperii\", in what has not been committed to them) except insofar as we may have granted it to them, for thus it says in 1 Peter 2, \"You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a priestly kingdom.\" In this way we are all priests, as many of us as are Christians. There are indeed priests whom we call ministers. They are chosen from among us, and who do everything in our name. That is a priesthood which is nothing else than the Ministry. Thus 1 Corinthians 4:1: \"No one should regard us as anything else than ministers of Christ and dispensers of the mysteries of God.\"\nThe Bible passage considered to be the basis of this belief is the First Epistle of Peter, 2:9:"}

It was founded by Lydia Maria Child. Publishers varied over the years, but the original publisher was John Putnam. Sarah Josepha Hale edited the magazine as a monthly between September 1834 and April 1836.\nHistory.\nThe magazine was founded in 1826 by Lydia Maria Child. She supervised its bimonthly publication between September 1826 and August 1834. Child's interest in abolitionism and the publication in 1833 of her antislavery book, \"An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans\", led to Child being socially shunned. Subscriptions to the magazine dropped off. Child left her editorial position. \nChild wrote in the magazine to child readers when leaving the magazine in 1834: \"After conducting the \"Miscellany\" for eight years, I am now compelled to bid a reluctant and most affectionate farewell to my little readers. May God bless you, my young friends, and impress deeply upon your hearts the conviction that all true excellence and happiness consists in living for others, not for yourselves. ... I intend hereafter to write other books for your amusement and instruction; and I part from you with less pain, because I hope that God will enable me to be a medium of use to you, in some other form than the \"Miscellany\".\" \nContent.\nThe magazine's content emphasized middle class Protestant values. It featured poems, stories, puzzles, and informative articles. The magazine was didactic. It provided amusement and imparted moral lessons while avoiding the piety so common in children's literature of the period. \nThe magazine was ground-breaking. The \"Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\" writes, \"The calm security of the lives of the children in the stories, the affection they receive, and their childishness were something new in American writing.\" \nThe writers who contributed to its pages included Eliza Leslie, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, Lydia Huntley Sigourney, Hannah Flagg Gould, Sarah Josepha Hale, Caroline Howard Gilman, and Anna Maria Wells. Child herself contributed as \"Aunt Maria\".\nResponse.\nThe magazine was hugely popular. Within four months of its debut, the magazine had 850 subscribers. While stories stressed the Protestant ethic, they were never boring. Caroline Healy Dall wrote in the \"Unitarian Review\" in 1883:\"No child who read the \"Juvenile Miscellany\" ... will ever forget the excitement that the appearance of each number caused. ... The children sat on the stone steps of their house doors all the way up and down Chestnut Street in Boston, waiting for the carrier. He used to cross the street, going from door to door in a zigzag fashion; and the fortunate possessor of the first copy found a crowd of little ones hanging over her shoulder from the steps above. ... How forlorn we were if the carrier was late!\""}

{"id": "406036", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406036", "title": "Rumination", "text": "Rumination is the constant urge for a person to focus their attention on their troubles, misery or worries and possible causes or consequences. Rumination is having thoughts about earlier events, failures, abuse or hardships. The tendency to ruminate often serves as a big factor for clinical depression. People who ruminate a lot are more likely to become depressed and to carry major mental troubles, such as generalized anxiety disorder and suicidal behavior. One type of rumination, the state rumination, is connected with pessimism and serious neurosis.\nTheories.\nResponse Styles Theory.\nThe Response Styles Theory (RST) was developed by in the early 1990s in the hope of explaining the strong relationship between depression and rumination. The theory describes rumination as a way of dealing with hard situations where you keep thinking about how and why you are depressed, and difficult situations in this way are more likely to get depressed in the future. Even though this theory is most focused on how rumination influences depression, research on rumination also explains how it relates to other mental troubles too, like anxiety, binge drinking and eating disorders. Wendy Traynor and her co-workers tried to improve RST to explain the link between rumination and depression better, because some people said that there might be other things that explain the relationship. They created the two-factor model. This says that rumination can be divided into two parts: brooding and reflection. Brooding is when you keep thinking of how your situation right now is not where you want to be, and what stops you from getting there. This style of rumination is related both to being depressed and getting depressed in the future. The second style is reflection, and is thought to be a better way to deal with difficult situations and feelings as it is related to less depression in the future. Reflection is when a person often tries to solve problems by thinking about how they can deal with their difficult situation or depression.\nPeople have criticised RST for being too simple. They say that we should pay more attention to how the things that make up rumination, like feeling lonely, being mean to yourself and feeling sad, influence each other. New research suggests that it might be wrong to simply describe rumination using two words (reflection and brooding), and that how we measure rumination should mirror how the parts that make up rumination are influencing each other. \nGoal Progress Theory.\nGoal Progress Theory (GPT) says that rumination is a way of achieving goals. This way of seeing rumination is very different from RST, which says that rumination \u201cdoes not lead to active problem solving\u201d. More specifically, GPT defines rumination as a result of the , which says that unfinished tasks come to mind more easily than finished tasks. So, when people who ruminate think the same thoughts over and over GPT explains this as a way of finding another path to reach a goal, and says that they will stop ruminating when they reach this goal. This concept has been tested in experiments. In one, people were told not to think of a white bear and were given feedback that either they did or did not succeed in this. Those who thought that they had not succeeded had thoughts related to white bears come to mind more easily than those who were told that they had been successful, showing the possible effect of unfinished goals on rumination. \nLinks to mental illnesses.\nDepression.\nIt is generally thought that those who ruminate, especially those who brood, have a higher likelihood of getting depressed and falling into a deeper depression than those who do not. This association seems to hold even when you account for people being depressed at the start of the study, and to be valid across ages and populations. Ruminating is also suggested to make people more vulnerable to other risk factors for depression such as gender, less memory of one\u2019s own life, , and perfectionism. The effects of the other kind of rumination, reflection, are more varied. Even though it is generally agreed that the this style of rumination is related to less depression overall, and especially a smaller likelihood of developing depression in the future, new research points to the connection between the reflection and self-critical ruminative thinking (often thinking the same mean thoughts about yourself).\nAt first, RST said that rumination predicted for how long one was depressed, but evidence has shown that this might not be true, and instead rumination predicts how many and how deep depressive episodes a person might have. It was also first suggested that people who ruminate can distract themselves to improve their mood, but this has been questioned and evidence against it has been shown since.\nAnxiety.\nRumination is in many ways similar and related to worry, which is central to anxiety disorders. This relationship is thought to explain the part of the link between anxiety and rumination. Still, rumination on its own, especially the brooding kind, has been shown to predict both having anxiety and getting it in the future. Brooding has also been shown to make the link between neuroticism and anxiety stronger. \nRumination is also thought to increase the risk of getting other mental troubles like bipolar disorder, eating disorders, binge drinking and self-injury.\nGender differences.\nStudies on what groups of people ruminate and how much show that women generally ruminate more than men. This difference is the biggest in teenage years, but on the whole it is small. Studies on this suggest that the higher likelihood for women to ruminate might explain the generally bigger portion of women suffering from depression compared to men. This finding is limited by similar things such as worry and neuroticism playing into the association, though. The two-factor model suggests that it is the higher rates of brooding among women specifically that is driving the gender differences we see in depressive symptoms."}

The government either fixes an absolute price that is charged, or a price range, with a minimum and a maxium. Usually this is done so that goods such as staple food remain affordable. It can also be done to avoid people charging way too much for a good or service, which is known as price gouging. Another field where it is done is to ensure a minimum wage or salary that employers must pay.\nThe problem with the approach is that according to the Law of Supply and Demand, the price of a good or service depends on its supply compared with the demand for it. If the price is fixed below the price the market would normally ask, the demand will increase - the product is \"cheaper\" than it should be. In general, the supply is fixed- at some point it is not possible to increase the production, and the supply. In the long term, it will therefore not be possible to meet the demand, and there will be a shortage.\nIn the 4th century BC, Lactantius wrote that Diocletian \"by various taxes he had made all things exceedingly expensive, attempted by a law to limit their prices. Then much blood [of merchants] was shed for trifles, men were afraid to offer anything for sale, and the scarcity became more excessive and grievous than ever. Until, in the end, the [price limit] law, after having proved destructive to many people, was from mere necessity abolished.\" As with Diocletian's Edict on Maximum Prices, shortages lead to black markets where prices for the same good exceed those of an uncontrolled market. Furthermore, once controls are removed, prices will immediately increase, which can temporarily shock the economic system.\nThe Arab oil embargo between October 19, 1973 and March 17, 1974 is another example on how price controls cause shortages: Long lines of cars and trucks quickly appeared at retail gas stations in the U.S. and some stations closed because of a shortage of fuel at the low price set by the U.S. Cost of Living Council. The fixed price was below what the market would otherwise pay and, as a result, the inventory disappeared. It made no difference whether prices were voluntarily or involuntarily posted below the market clearing price. Scarcity resulted in either case. Price controls fail to achieve their proximate aim, which is to reduce prices paid by retail consumers, but such controls do manage to reduce supply. When price controls on gasoline were lifted, the shortage ended and the long lines of cars at gas pumps disappeared.\nNobel prize winner Milton Friedman said \"We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas.\""}

They are also secretive and don't show many emotions. It is often shortened to SzPD or SPD. \nThis condition is not schizophrenia. People with SzPD will typically share some of the negative symptoms and characteristics of schizophrenia, such as blunted affect or detachment. However, schizoids do not have the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations. A negative symptom is one that is taken away from a person. A positive symptom is one that is added to a person. \nPeople who have SzPD do not want interpersonal relationships which require emotion and commitment. People with SzPD are introverts who feel the need to be independent or alone. Many schizoids are asexual or have little interest in sexual encounters. Any relationships they may have likely do not involve emotional attachment. SzPD is more common in men than women. Some of the negative symptoms of the disorder (such as low energy) may be treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs.\nTheodore Millon said that there are four types of schizoid: languid, remote, depersonalized, and affectless. \nSalman Ahktar said that there were two types of schizoid: overt, and covert. Overt meaning visible, covert meaning secret or invisible. Covert or secret schizoids are active in social conversation and the outside world. However they do not tend to get emotionally attached to people. Acting differently in public is known as masking. This is common in many other psychological disorders. \nDiagnosis.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is a manual for diagnosing mental disorders. DSM-5 still includes schizoid personality disorder with the same requirements as in DSM-4. To be diagnosed with SzPD, one must have these behaviors consistently and be troubled by them. They also need to have at least 4 of these symptoms. \nAnother way a person with SzPD can be diagnosed is through the ICD-10 which is the International Classification of Diseases. The person must have the behaviors consistently. They must be troubled by them. They also need to have at least 4 of these symptoms.\nSometimes SzPD can be confused with other disorders such as Depression or Avoidant Personality Disorder. Sometimes people can have SzPD and other similar disorders. This is called being comorbid.\nTreatment.\nTo manage their disorder, people with SzPD can take medication. One is called Buproprion. They can also go to psychotherapy. This means they talk to a therapist. The therapist helps them try to connect more with other people."}

Some people also consider Maryland and Delaware to be part of the North, but the United States Census Bureau consider both states to be part of the southern United States. \nThe following table provides information about the population, size (land area) and population density of states in the Northeast region as defined by the U.S. Census bureau. Population density is defined as the population divided by the area of land in the state or region. The rank column in the table shows how the states rank among the entire 50 states in population density. Note that New Jersey has the highest population density of any state and that the 4 highest density states are all in the Northeast. The rank for the Census divisions (in pink) is the rank in population density among the 9 total divisions in the country. Note that the two divisions in the Northeast (New England and Mid-Atlantic) are ranked #1 and #2 in the 2013 population estimate. The South Atlantic region was close behind New England and is projected to surpass New England in the next population estimate because it is growing faster. Finally, note that the entire Northeast region is ranked #1 among the 4 Census Bureau regions. With 345.5 people per square mile, the population density of the Northeast is about 2.5 times the density or the #2 ranked region which is the South."}

It carried knights in battles, tournaments, and jousts. It was described by contemporary sources as the \"Great Horse\", due to its significance.\nThe word \"destrier\" comes from the Vulgar Latin \"dextarius\", meaning \"right-sided\" (the same root as our modern \"dexterous\" and \"dexterity\"). This may refer to it being led by the squire at the knight's right side (or led by the right hand) or to the horse's gait, (possibly leading with the right).\nWhile highly prized by knights and men-at-arms, the destrier was not very common. Most knights and mounted men-at-arms rode other war horses, such as coursers and rounceys. These three types of horse were often called chargers.\nCharacteristics of the destrier.\nThe word \"destrier\" does not refer to a breed, but to a \"type\" of horse: the finest and strongest warhorse. These horses were usually stallions, bred and raised from colts specifically for the needs of war. The destrier was also considered the most suited to the joust; coursers seem to have been preferred for other forms of warfare. They had powerful hindquarters, able to easily coil and spring to stop, spin, turn or sprint forward. They also had a short back and well-muscled loin, strong bone, and a well-arched neck. From medieval art, the head of the destrier appears to have had a straight or slightly convex profile, strong, wide jaw, and good width between the eyes.\nThe destrier was specifically for use in battle or tournament; for everyday riding, a knight would use a palfrey, and his baggage would be carried on a sumpter horse (or packhorse), or possibly in wagons."}

{"id": "406242", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406242", "title": "County Antrim", "text": "County Antrim is one of the six counties of Northern Ireland. It is in the province of Ulster. It is named after its former county town, Antrim. The name comes from the Irish \"Aontroim\" which means \"lone ridge\". The largest part of the capital city of Northern Ireland, Belfast, is also in County Antrim. The rest of Belfast is in County Down.\nGeography.\nA large part of Antrim is very hilly. The highest hills are in the east of the county. The mountain range runs north and south, and, following this direction the highest points are Knocklayd , Slieveanorra , Trostan , Slemish , Agnew's Hill and Divis . Along the coast there are a lot of cliffs in the north. Some of the most remarkable cliffs are those formed of vertical basaltic columns, like at the Giant's Causeway.\nThe only large island of County Antrim is L-shaped Rathlin Island, off Ballycastle, in total length by maximum breadth, from the coast.\nThe river Bann and the river Lagan are the two important rivers in the county. The fisheries of the Bann and of Lough Neagh (especially for salmon and eels) are of value both commercially and to sportsmen. The county borders Lough Neagh. \nTransport.\nCounty Antrim has a number of air, rail and sea links.\nAir.\nBelfast International Airport is in County Antrim. It is Northern Ireland's main airport. There are regular flights to Great Britain, Europe and North America.\nThe other airport in the area, George Best Belfast City Airport, lies a mile east of Belfast city centre on the County Down side of the city.\nRail.\nThe main Translink Northern Ireland Railways routes are the major line between Belfast, Antrim, Ballymena, Coleraine and Londonderry, Belfast to Carrickfergus and Larne, the port for Stranraer in Scotland and Coleraine to Portrush.\nSea.\nTwo of Northern Ireland's main ports are in County Antrim, Larne and Belfast.\nFerries sail from Larne Harbour to destinations including Cairnryan and Troon in Scotland, and Fleetwood in England.\nThe Port of Belfast is Northern Ireland's main port. It is a major centre of industry and commerce and has become established as the focus of logistics activity for Northern Ireland. Around two thirds of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade, and a quarter of that for Ireland as a whole, is handled at the port which receives over 6,000 vessels each year.\nIrish language.\nStatistics for 2009-2010 show 1,832 students attending the 12 Gaelscoileanna (Irish language primary schools) and 1 Gaelchol\u00e1iste (Irish language secondary school).\nReligion.\nThe Presbyterian Church in Ireland is the largest religious denomination, followed by the Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland. County Antrim is one of two counties in Ireland in which most of people are Protestant, according to the 2001 census, the other being Down. The strong Presbyterian presence in the county is mostly because of the county's historical links with lowland Scotland.\nHistory.\nIt is unknown when the county of Antrim was formed. It was the name of a district in the early 14th century, before Edward II was king. The earliest known people to live here were Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of pre-Celtic origin.\nIn ancient times, a Celtic people called the Darini lived in Antrim.\nIn the early Middle Ages, southern County Antrim was part of the Kingdom of Ulidia. It was ruled by the D\u00e1l Fiatach clans Keenan and MacDonlevy/McDunlavey. The north was part of D\u00e1l Riada, which stretched into what is now western Scotland over the Irish Sea. D\u00e1l Riada was ruled by the O'Lynch clan. The D\u00e1l nAraide and the Cruthin, who were pre-Gaelic Celts and probably related to the Picts of Britain lived in lower County Antrim. Between the 8th and 11th centuries there were Vikings in Antrim too.\nIn the late 12th century Antrim became part of the Earldom of Ulster, won by Anglo-Norman invaders. Edward Bruce fought to restore local, Gaelic, government in 1315. It left Carrickfergus as the only significant English stronghold.\nIn the late Middle Ages, Antrim was divided into three parts: northern Clandeboye, the Glynnes and the Route. The Cambro-Norman MacQuillans were powerful in the Route. A branch of the O'Neills of Tyrone migrated to Clandeboye in the 14th century, and ruled it for a time. Their family was called O'Neill Clannaboy. A Gallowglass sept, the MacDonnells, became the most powerful in the Glynnes in the 15th century.\nDuring the Tudor era (16th century) numerous adventurers from Britain wanted to come and live in the region. Many Scots settled in Antrim around this time. In 1588 the Antrim coast was the scene of one of the 24 wrecks of the Spanish Armada in Ireland. The Spanish vessel \"La Girona\" was wrecked off Lacana Point, Giant's Causeway in 1588 with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.\nHistoric monuments.\nThe historical monuments of the county consist of cairns, mounts or forts, remains of religious and military structures, and round towers.\nThe principal cairns are: one on Colin mountain, near Lisburn; one on Slieve True, near Carrickfergus; and two on Colinward. The cromlechs most worthy of notice are: one near Cairngrainey, to the north-east of the old road from Belfast to Templepatrick; the large cromlech at Mount Druid, near Ballintoy; and one at the northern extremity of Islandmagee. The mounts, forts and entrenchments are very numerous.\nThere are three round towers: one at Antrim, one at Armoy, and one on Ram's Island in Lough Neagh. There are some remains of the religious establishments at Bonamargy, where the earls of Antrim are buried, Kells, Glenarm, Glynn, Muckamore and Whiteabbey.\nCarrickfergus Castle, dating from the Norman invasion of Ireland is a well preserved medieval structure. There are, however, remains of other ancient castles, as Olderfleet, Cam's, Shane's, Glenarm, Garron Tower, Red Bay, and Dunluce Castle, notable for its dramatic location on a rocky hill.\nSaint Patrick.\nSlemish, about eight miles (13\u00a0km) east of Ballymena, is where St Patrick's lived when he was young. According to tradition Saint Patrick was a slave for seven years, near the hill of Slemish, until he escaped back to Great Britain.\nLinen.\nLinen manufacturing was previously an important industry in the County. At the time Ireland produced a large amount of flax. Cotton-spinning by jennies was first introduced to Belfast by industrialists Robert Joy and Thomas M'Cabe in 1777; and twenty-three years later it was estimated that more than 27,000 people were employed in the industry within ten miles (16\u00a0km) of Belfast.\nGovernment.\nThe traditional county town is Antrim. More recently, Ballymena was the seat of county government. The counties of Northern Ireland ceased to be administrative entities in 1973, with the reorganization of local government.\nIn Northern Ireland the county structure is no longer used in local government. Northern Ireland is split into districts. The majority of County Antrim residents are administered by the following nine councils:\nSmall portions of the county are administered by councils that are based in neighbouring counties, notably the village of Aghagallon in the Craigavon Borough and the town of Portrush in the Coleraine Borough.\nThe county contains all of five parliamentary constituencies:\nParts of the following constituencies are also in County Antrim:"}

The winners in a war would take back whatever they wanted, and slaves and booty were top of the list. The first recorded booty in history is a stele taken during 1160\u00a0BC.\nThe earliest found artefacts made of silver and gold are from Lake Varna in Bulgaria dated 4250\u20134000\u00a0BC, the earliest made of copper are dated 9000\u20137000\u00a0BC.\nThe term \"treasury\" was first used in classical antiquity to describe the places built for gifts to the gods. An example is the Siphnian Treasury in Delphi. Many similar buildings were put up in Olympia, Greece by city-states hoping to impress others during the ancient Olympic Games. In Ancient Greece treasuries were almost always inside religious buildings such as temples. This made state funds sacrosanct, and adding moral constraints to the punishment for thieves.\nThe sovereigns' treasury in the palace in ancient Jerusalem,was similar in nature to the temple treasury. Those treasuries had officials, and worked rather like a bank.\nIn excavations of Persopolis a text about to the activities of a treasury were discovered. It dates to the fifth century BC. The texts were written in the Elamite language.\nThe ancient Roman word \"aerarium\" signified the treasury of the Senate, \"fiscus\" was used to indicate the imperial treasury used by Caesar.\n They had, as we do, the distinction between a treasury as a store of valuables, and the treasury as an office of finance.\nTreasuries in modern government.\nH.M. Treasury.\nIn the United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Treasury is overseen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The traditional honorary title of First Lord of the Treasury is held by the Prime Minister. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs administers the taxation system.\nIn the United States, the Treasurer reports to an executive-appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The IRS is the revenue agency of the US Department of the Treasury.\nMinistry of Finance.\nIn many other countries, the treasury is called the Ministry of Finance. Its head is known as the Finance Minister. Examples include New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Japan.\nBoth.\nIn some other countries, a Treasury will co-exist with a separate Ministry of Finance, with divided functions.\nThe government of Poland includes the Ministry of Finance as well as the Ministry of State Treasury, as does the government of the Ukraine. It was the same in Italy before the creation of the united Ministry of Economy. In the Australian federal government a treasurer and a finance minister co-exist."}

The lance is longer, thicker and heavier than an infantry spear, and is not intended for throwing, or for quick thrusting. Lances did not have tips meant to break off or bend, unlike many throwing weapons of the spear and javelin family. They often had a vamplate, a small circular plate to prevent the hand sliding up the shaft upon impact. \nThe lance was longer than a spear, about 9\u201310 feet long. When charging the lance was carried under the arm (couched) using the weight of the horse and rider to push the lance tip into its intended target. It was a medieval shock and awe weapon (caused great fear) to have a number of mounted knights with lances charging towards you. In may cases it caused panic and the enemy fled the battle. \nThey were used by European knights, but the use of lances was spread over the Old World wherever horses were available. The use of the lance was made possible by the use of the stirrup added to saddles. It allowed the knight to control the horse and stand in the saddle. As a backup weapon, lancers (one who used a lance) of that period also carried swords, maces (a type of club) or something else suited to hand-to-hand (or close) combat, since the lance was often used only once during an event. It could not be used once the combatants were close to each other. \nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It is based on an originally Dutch language TV series of the same name which was created by John de Mol in 1997. The show follows a group of House Guests living together 24 hours a day in the \"Big Brother\" house. They are isolated from everyone outside of the house. They are videotaped with no privacy for three months. Since its US television start in 2000, \"Big Brother\" has continue airing with at least one season of the show on CBS each year. It is currently the second longest version of the show to have done so, after the Spanish version. On September 19, 2012, CBS announced that \"Big Brother\" was renewed for its 15th season in summer 2013. The 15th season began on June 26, 2013.\nThe HouseGuests compete for the chance to win $500,000. They must try to avoid weekly eviction, until the last HouseGuest remains. The American series is hosted by television personality Julie Chen. It is produced by Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan for Fly On The Wall Entertainment. It currently airs in the United States on CBS and in Canada on Global.\nMain series.\nEviction night are hosted by television personality and news anchor, Julie Chen. She is the wife of CBS President Les Moonves and co-host of the network's \"The Talk\". Chen was a former co-host of CBS's \"The Early Show\". Television critics gave Chen negative reviews during her first season (2000). Many critics did not like that she was very stale when presenting. They also did not like her \"weak\" interviews with evictees during the live program. They also did not like Chen's phrase \"But first...\", they believed she used it too much. Many fans of the show began calling her \"the Chenbot\". Chen later stated that she knows about this and accepts it.\nThere was an announcer during the first season. The announcer introduced every scene. As the show progressed, the announcer only came on during the opening and closing of each episode. There have been several different announcers throughout the years. Past announcers include Dave Walsh (season and episode 2 of season two), Chuck Riley (season two), and Phil Proctor (seasons 3-6). The current announcer is Clayton Halsey and has been the announcer since season seven.\nFormat.\nThe format for the first season is very different than the following seasons. The first season was very similar to international versions of \"Big Brother\". Each HouseGuest would individually go to the Diary Room and nominate two fellow HouseGuests for banishment. The term \"eviction\" was not used until the second season. The two or more HouseGuests with the most nominations are then revealed to the House and were \"Marked for Banishment\". The public were invited to vote for who they wish to evict by calling a premium rate telephone number. The HouseGuest who received the most public vote was evicted. When there were three HouseGuests left, the public would vote for the winner.\nStarting with the second season, the HouseGuests compete to become Head of Household or HoH. The Head of Household is responsible for nominating two HouseGuests for eviction. During the Live Eviction show, HouseGuests individually go into the Diary Room and vote on who they wish to evict. Julie then reveals the results of the vote to the House. She then tells the evicted HouseGuest that s/he only has a few moments to leave the house. In the event of a tie, the HoH will be the deciding vote. When two HouseGuests remain, the evicted HouseGuests voted for the winner. However, if there were a tie the public would vote.\nIn \"Big Brother 3\" (2002), a new power was introduced called the Power of Veto (PoV). The Power of Veto winner can choose to veto one of the Head of Household's nominations. When this happens, the HoH chooses someone else to replace that nominee. The winner is also protected from becoming a replacement nominee for the week. At first, the Power of Veto was silver and if a nominee won the Power of Veto the nominee could not save themselves. The \"Golden\" Power of Veto was introduced in the last veto competition in season three. If a nominee won it, they could save themselves.\nThe \"Crystal\" Power of Veto was introduced in the final veto competition of \"Big Brother 4\" (2003). It could only be used by a nominee. If anyone else won it, it could not be used. The Golden Power of Veto is now the standard veto since season four. The fourth season also started the Big Brother Jury or sometimes called the \"Jury of Seven\". The Jury is made up of the final seven evicted HouseGuests. Each member of the Jury are isolated in a different house. The Jury members are not allowed to watch the show except for small parts such as the nominations and the Power of Veto ceremonies. They are not allowed to see any Diary Room interviews or any footage involving strategy or twists to the game. The Big Brother Jury votes to determine the winner of \"Big Brother\" each season.\nTen years later, \"Big Brother 15\" (2013) raised the number of nominees from two to three a week. This is similar to the French Canadian version of the show. In addition, a new weekly power called the Most Valuable Player (MVP) will give this HouseGuest a special power. The MVP will have the ability to nominate the 3rd nominee, without anyone knowing who the MVP was.\nLive show.\nLive shows have been broadcast on Thursday nights in every season. However, the first, fourth, ninth and the fifteenth seasons were not broadcast on Thursday nights. The fourth, ninth and fifteenth seasons were instead on Wednesday nights. Later in the season, there would be live shows on other days. These examples were for double evictions. From the second season through the ninth season, Chen presented the live show in an empty studio next to the house. Starting with the tenth season, the live shows once again had an audience."}

About 100 years later, women started to wear surcoats. It can either mean a coat worn over other garments or the outer garment commonly worn over armour. The name comes from the French meaning \"over the cotta\", a long, wide coat reaching down to the feet without sleeves.\nStarting about the 12th century, knights wore long and flowing surcoats over their armour. They would often show the coat of arms of the wearer. A knight's surcoat reached almost to the ankles. It had slits (cuts) in the bottom front and back so a wearer could sit. It also had no sleeves. One purpose for the surcoat was to protect armour from the rain. Another use was during the Crusades to keep the armour cooler in the sun.\nBy the middle of the 14th century the long surcoat was replaced with the \"Jupon\" (or \"Gipon\"). This was a much shorter garment, which was often padded for extra protection. Once suits of plate (solid) armour became common, the surcoat was no longer used."}

It is a man-made antibiotic. Their ability to kill infectious bacteria is their main function, but some types have other medical uses. For example, sulfasalazine, in addition to its use as an antibiotic, is also used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.\nSulfonamides (sometimes called sulfa drugs or sulpha drugs) contain the sulfonamide chemical group. The best known of the antibiotic sulfonamide drugs is called Sulfanilimide.\nHow they work.\nIn bacteria, antibacterial sulfonamides inhibit the enzyme DHPS. The enzyme makes folic acid, a B vitamin. The microorganism is \"starved\" of folate and dies.\nHumans, unlike bacteria, get folate (vitamin B9) through their diet.\nHistory.\nSulfonamide drugs were the first antimicrobial drugs. They paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine. Experiments with the first sulfonamide began in 1932 in the laboratories of Bayer AG, at that time a component of the huge German chemical trust IG Farben. After years of fruitless trial-and-error work on hundreds of compounds, a team led by physician/researcher Gerhard Domagk finally found one that worked: a red dye synthesized by Bayer chemist Josef Klarer which had remarkable effects on stopping some bacterial infections in mice. The first official communication about the breakthrough discovery was not published until 1935, more than two years after the drug was patented by Klarer and his research partner Fritz Mietzsch.\n\"Prontosil\", as Bayer named the new drug, was the first medicine ever discovered that could effectively treat a range of bacterial infections inside the body. It had a strong protective action against infections caused by streptococci, and a lesser effect on infections caused by other cocci. However, it had no effect at all in the test tube, exerting its antibacterial action only in live animals. Later, it was discovered that the drug was split into two pieces inside the body, releasing from the inactive dye a smaller, colourless, active compound called \"sulfanilamide\". The discovery dashed the corporation's dreams of enormous profit. The active molecule sulfanilamide (or sulfa) had first been synthesized in 1906 and was widely used in the dye-making industry; its patent had since expired and the drug was available to anyone.\nThe result was a sulfa craze. As the first and only effective antibiotic available in the years before penicillin, sulfa drugs continued to thrive through the early years of World War II. They are credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of patients, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr. (son of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) (in 1936) and Winston Churchill. Sulfa had a central role in preventing wound infections during the war. American soldiers were issued a first-aid kit containing sulfa pills and powder, and were told to sprinkle the powder on any open wound.\nMany thousands of molecules containing the sulfanilamide structure have been created since its discovery (by one account, over 5,400 permutations by 1945). They have greater effectiveness and less toxicity. Sulfa drugs are still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. They are back in favour for use on infections caused by bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.\nHow they are made.\nSulfonamides are prepared by the reaction of a sulfonyl chloride with ammonia or an amine."}

The length also kept the soldier at a greater distance from the enemy. But the length also made pikes difficult to use in close combat. were usually arranged in a very tight formation several lines deep. The earliest of these were called a phalanx formation.

{"id": "406800", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406800", "title": "Child development", "text": "Child development refers to biological, psychological and emotional changes that happen in humans between birth and the end of adolescence, at which time the individual goes from dependence to independence. The development is strongly influenced by genetic, mental, physical and social factors that may happen during the progression. Children develop at different levels. In particular, children having autism spectrum troubles or Down syndrome may have different development than usual or substandard motor development. Ideas about how children develop psychologically have changed over time. There are several important theories on how children develop.\nEarly ideas.\nIn medieval times.\nDuring this time children were seen as separate than adults. Children under 7 or 8 were different than other people and treated as children. Even teenagers were not fully grown. Religious writings sometimes talked about children as evil and needing to be pure. They also sometimes talked about them as good and angels.\nDuring the Reformation.\nAt the time of the Reformation, children were thought to be born evil. Adults thought children needed to be taught to be a person. Children had to wear tight and uncomfortable clothes. Raising a child was thought to be one of the most important things. Adults wanted children to use reason in learning.\nAge of Enlightenment.\nIn the time of the Enlightenment, people started to think differently about children and development. People respected children more and treated them better. Two important people had ideas about children during the Enlightenment. They were John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\nJohn Locke.\nJohn Locke thought that children were born without any knowledge. He thought the mind is \"tabula rasa\", or blank slate. This means that the mind is like a blank piece of paper when someone is born. Children get knowledge in life and fill up the blank paper. Locke thought that the only way that children get knowledge is from doing different things in life and getting experience from those things. Locke\u2019s ideas on how children get knowledge changed how people thought about children. His belief was that learning should be fun rather than a task. \"Children [should be] free to be childish,\u201d wrote Locke. Locke's ideas were opposed to church principles, strictly believing children should be reading fables and not religious texts. Children were seen in a better way and got more respect from adults. Locke wanted parents to spend more time with their children and help them learn. He thought that children\u2019s development of knowledge needed parents to help children experience new things and teach about those things. Locke pushed nurture as the most important part of child development.\nJean-Jacques Rousseau.\nJean Jacques Rousseau had a different idea than Locke on children. He thought that children are born knowing what is right and wrong. Rousseau did not think that children are \u201cblank slates\u201d as Locke did. He thought that children are \u201cnoble savages\u201d. This is the idea that children are born good, but society can make them bad. Rousseau felt that adults should pay attention to children\u2019s needs during their different stages of development.\nChild development theories.\nPsychosexual theory.\nSigmund Freud was a neurologist an psychoanalyst who tried to help adults with their troubles. He talked with adults about when they were children and anything that happened during that time. Freud focused on the unconscious mind. This is the part of the mind that a person is not able to know about directly. Freud thought that the unconscious mind was important in how people think and feel. The way people think and feel can affect how they act. Freud\u2019s ideas lead him to make his psychosexual theory. The psychosexual theory focuses on how a child\u2019s wants are controlled in early years and the effect it has when the child becomes an adult.\nFreud thought that each person\u2019s personality is made of three parts. The parts are the id, ego, and super-ego. The three parts each have a purpose, but are almost never in agreement. The three parts not in agreement is what causes people to be unhappy and have problems.\nWhen a baby is born, it only has basic needs. The baby needs to eat, sleep, and use the bathroom. These basic needs help the baby to live. These basic needs are what make up the id. The id only wants to take cause of these needs. The id wants the needs to be taken care of right away and not have to wait. Freud thought that young children are ruled by the id. The id does not know or care about right and wrong. It only wants to take care of its needs. This means that young children do not know about right and wrong. They only know what the id wants. Children will act on the wants of the id even when they should not. Children begin to learn that they cannot always get what they want when they want it. This causes the ego to form. The ego \u201cis ruled by the reality principle\u201d. This means that it knows what can really happen in the world. The ego knows if the id can get what it wants by looking at if the want can be filled. When the id\u2019s needs cannot be taken care of, the ego controls the id and its wants. Children that have the ego formed can control their basic needs and their actions. When the ego is formed, children gain a sense of self by controlling their needs. The superego is formed by children working with their parents and others in society. The superego acts as a rule follower. It allows the child to know what is right and wrong by what society\u2019s rules on right and wrong are. Guilt is the primary way that the superego tells children the rules of what is right and wrong.\nFreud thought that children went through five psychosexual stages of development. In the stages children have to fix problems between needs and what society wants. Fixing these problems allows children to do well as adults. Problems that adults get have to do with the stage where they had trouble with. The five stages are : oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. The oral stage begins at birth and has to do with the baby\u2019s suckling needs. The anal stage is the second and is from 1-3 year olds. It has to do with holding and letting go of urine and feces. The third stage, the phallic stage is from 3-6 year olds and has to do with the genital region. Freud thought that this stage is one of the most important stages to fix problems in. If a child does not fix the problems, he or she can develop either the Oedipus complex (for boys) or the Electra complex (for girls). These problems come from love either a boy\u2019s love for his mother or a girl\u2019s love for her father. To stop problems the boy or girl take up the values of their father (for boys) or mother (for girls). The fourth stage of the psychosexual stages is the latency stage and it occurs from 6-11 year olds. In this stage the superego grows the most and children get values from society. The last stage is the genital stage and lasts through adolescence. In this stage children start to like others and form heterosexual relationships.\nFreud's Psychosexual Stages.\nFreud\u2019s theory of child development is important because it was the first to point out the importance of parent-child relationships.\nPsychocosocial theory.\nErik Erikson was a follower of Freud\u2019s ideas and started his own theory using Freud\u2019s ideas. Erikson\u2019s theory is called the psychosocial theory of child development. Erikson used Freud\u2019s idea of the id, ego, and superego and his stages of development to build his own theory. Erikson thought that the ego was \u201cof the utmost importance\u201d. The ego was important because it lets children become an individual and add to society. Erikson added more stages to his theory than Freud did, and some of his stages are similar to Freud\u2019s. Erikson ended up with eight stages in his theory. Every stage has a problem between two different feelings. A child's personality is shaped by how they fix each problem.\nErkison's stages\nErikson\u2019s stages are important because they looked at society and culture and how they affect personality. Freud only focused on sexuality. Erkison's stages are also show how personality is shaped as children grow.\nErikson's vs Freud's Stages\nBehaviorism.\nJohn Watson did not like the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Erikson. Watson chose to look at behavior of people to understand how children develop. His ideas fall under the concept of behaviorism. Watson was \u201cinspired by Pavlov\u2019s studies of animal learning\u201d. Pavlov\u2019s studies focused on classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is when an animal or person learns to react to stimulus, a thing that will cause a reaction. Watson thought that children could be taught using this way. Watson decided to test his theory by doing an experiment using a nine-month old baby, Little Albert.\nWatson started his experiment by testing if Albert was scared of anything. Watson wanted to see if Albert was scared of a white rat. Like most babies Albert was not scared of the white rat. Watson wanted to test if he could make Albert scared using classical conditioning. Watson discovered that Albert was scared of the sound of a hammer hitting a steel gong with a hammer. When Albert was eleven-months old,Watson went on with the experiment. Albert was given the white rat. A few seconds later, Watson made the hammer hit the gong. Albert cried when this happened. This was done seven times. After the seven times, Albert would cry when he saw the white rat. Little Albert also became scared of other things, called generalization. These things had a similarity to the white rat. They were a rabbit, a dog, a fur coat, a Santa Claus mask, and Watson's hair. Watson's experiment was important because he was able to teach Albert to be scared of something.\nWatson showed that children can be taught through classical conditioning. After the experiment, Watson thought that children are affected by the environment.\nSocial Learning theory.\nAlbert Bandura felt that children learn by watching others in society. After watching, children then copy what was done. His theory is called social learning theory. The copying that children perform is called modeling. The person that children copy is called the model. Bandura thought there are four conditions needed for modeling to happen. \nThe Bobo Doll experiment (1961).\nChildren are likely to model behavior if the model is of the same-sex. A girl child will copy a woman model better than a man. This is because the child wants to act like people she is like. Also, Children are more likely to model behavior if the behavior gets positive reactions from adults. When children are praised they will keep doing the behavior. They do this because they want to get more praise. A child will not always get praise for their behaviors. Instead they might get punishment. If a child gets punishment for a behavior they will not model it. A child can also chose to model behavior or not by watching what happens to the model. If the model gets punishment the child will not model the behavior. This is because the child does not want to get punishment. Bandura did an experiment to test his ideas. The experiment is known as the Bobo Doll Experiment.\nBandura took 36 boys and 36 girls for his experiment. The children were between 3 and 6 years old. He also used one man and one woman model. Bandura wanted to see if the children would model aggressive, or mean, behavior. Bandura broke the children into eight groups of 6 and one group of 24. The groups were made by breaking half of the children into an aggressive group and half into one that was not. The two groups were both broken in half again by boys and girls. Bandura then split the girls into two groups. One group had the woman model and the other had the man model. He did the same with the boys. The group of 24 had no model. \nThe children were put in a play room with the model. The children were told to sit on a chair and the model went to the other side of the room. The children that were in aggressive groups saw the model go up the a Bobo doll in the room and play with it. The model spent most of the time being aggressive to the doll. The children that were not in the aggressive group saw the model play with tinker toys and not pay attention to the Bobo doll. The model then left the room. The children were allowed to play with the toys in the room. Some of the toys let the children play and be aggressive. The children were watched how they played with the toys. Children who saw the aggressive model played aggressively with the toys. The children who had a model who was not aggressive played nicer. The children played nice because they did not watch the aggressive model to copy the behavior. Bandura's experiment showed that children can learn behavior from adults by watching the adult's behavior.\nCognitive Developmental Theory.\nJean Piaget started his theory on child development when he questioned the way children think. He thought that infants and children had different understandings than adults. Piaget focused on the cognitive development of children instead of adults. Cognitive development is studying how adults and children think and learn. Piaget\u2019s work helped to develop new ways of education and programs of discovery learning. Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development has three main parts:\nSchemas.\nPiaget thought children had and made schemas as they developed. Schemas are ways of making sense of experience. A schema is a picture of something in a child\u2019s mind. The picture is normally of how different things happen in the world. The picture helps the child understand and behave in the world. An example of a schema would be a child\u2019s schema for being in a classroom. The child\u2019s picture would have things like students sitting in chairs at desks. A teacher is in the front of the class teaching. This schema helps the child know how to act and know what might happen in the classroom.\nPiaget thought that the first schemas have to do with the child\u2019s reaction to the world. Piaget thought that babies are born with some schemas without learning them. These schemas are sensorimotor actions. The schemas are very simple. Schemas get more complex as the child gets older. The child starts to think before acting. When the child does this, it uses mental representations, or pictures in the mind that are representative of different things. The mental representations can be changed in the mind into new ideas. Piaget thought that the two most powerful mental representations are images and concepts. Images are pictures in the mind of objects, people and spaces. Concepts put the images together in different groups. Schemas can be changed and made from putting together and changing images and concepts in the child\u2019s mind.\nAdaptation.\nPiaget thought that a child\u2019s mind changes to better fit with the world through adaption. Children use adaptation by changing schemas to fit the world. Piaget thought that adaptation has two parts: assimilation and accommodation. In assimilation children use the schemes they have to understand the world. Children\u2019s schemes do not always right. When a child has a schema that is not right, they have to change it. This is called accommodation. In accommodation new schemes are made or old ones are changed. The changes must take place so the child can better understand the world. Piaget thought there is a balance between assimilation and accommodation. He called the balance cognitive equilibrium. When a child\u2019s schemes fit their understanding of the world then the child is in equilibrium. When the schemes do not fit the child is in disequilibrium. Piaget called the moving between equilibrium and disequilibrium equilibration.\nStages of cognitive development.\nPiaget broke his stages of cognitive development of children into four stages. The stages always go in the same order. The stages also happen to children everywhere. At each stage there are key details that happen in that stage. \nSensorimotor Stage.\nThe sensorimotor stage is the first stage of Piaget\u2019s theory. In this stage, babies \u201cthink\u201d with their eyes, ear, and hands. Children in this stage learn about the world through their senses. Piaget thought that children in this stage learn by doing the same acts over and over. These acts come from their sense experience. Piaget called this circular reaction. There are two main kinds of circular reaction: primary and secondary. One month olds use primary circular reaction. In primary circular reaction children do acts that have to do with their basic needs, like eating. Four to eight month olds use secondary circular reaction. Secondary circular reaction happens when children try to make events happen with their acts. Secondary circular reaction in children helps to control their own behavior. Eight to twelve month olds can control their behavior. In the sensorimotor stage, children gain object permanence. This happens between 8 and 12 months. Object permanence is knowing that a thing is still in existence even if the child cannot see it. Object permanence is seen in children eight to twelve months old. Object permanence can be seen in Piaget\u2019s object hiding task. In the task a toy is hidden under a blanket. If the baby can find the toy than the baby has learned object permanence.\nPreoperational StageThe preoperational stage has a large change in representative thought in the mind. In this stage children can use symbols to represent their knowledge. Children also learn language in the preoperational stage. Piaget did not think language was that important for cognitive development. He thought that children use words to explain the pictures of experience in their mind. In the preoperational stage, children have egocentricism. Egocentricism is when children cannot tell the difference between their view point and someone else\u2019s. Piaget used the three mountains problem to show egocentricism. In the problem a doll is placed on one side of a group of mountains. A child is placed on a different side. The child is asked to tell what the doll sees. A child who has egocentricism tells what he or she sees and not what the doll sees. \nThis is for the simple wiki page on child development.\nConcrete Operational Stage.\nIn the concrete operational stage children\u2019s thought becomes more logical. Logical thought uses reason when thinking. Children are able to understand changes between things that are in front of them. They still have a hard time with things that they have to imagine. Children in the concrete operational stage can place items in different arrangements. They understand that things can be placed into more than one group at a time. Children in the concrete operational stage can also put things in order of qualities like length and weight. The understanding of conservation happens in the concrete operational stage. Children who understand conservation know that changing a things shape or container does not change how much is there. For example, in conservation of liquid children know that the amount of liquid does not change if it is put in a different glass.\nFormal Operational Stage.\nIn the formal operational stage, children are able to think about abstract ideas. The abstract ideas are ones that are within the child\u2019s mind and not in front of them in the world. In this stage, children can come up with rules about how things can happen without needing concrete items. Piaget believed that there were two main parts of the formal operational stage: hypothetico-deductive reasoning and propositional thought. In hyothetico-deductive reasoning children are able to guess the outcome of a problem. They are able to do this by making guesses that can be tested in an experiment. By testing the guesses they learn if their guess was right and if not why it was not. In propositional thought children are able to understand if spoken statements are true. They are able to do so without needing to see an example of those statements.\nSociocultural Theory.\nLev Vygotsky built his theory of child development on the importance of three things. Vygotsky thought that children\u2019s development was formed from mainly social and cultural interactions. Interactions occur when two or more people talk and/or work together. Vygotsky thought that culture has a big affect on how cognitive growth develops. Vygotsky also focused on language. He felt language was very important for changing how a child thinks.\nLanguage.\nVygotsky thought that child development during the first two years have to do with direct connection with the world. After the two years language changes the way a child thinks. Language is important because it is how adults pass on ideas to children. Vygotsky felt that growth of language leads to a huge change in how children think because they can communicate ideas with others. Children talk to both others and themselves. Vygotsky thought that children talking to themselves was very important for development. He thought that children talk to themselves to help guide their thoughts. He called talk directed at the self, private speech. Private speech is used when a job is hard, after an error is made, or when the child is unsure of what to do. Children that use private speech are more attentive and involved in the job they are doing. Also children who have trouble learning use private speech more. This is to help them understand what they are learning.\nSocial and Cultural Interactions.\nVygotsky thought that important learning comes from working with adults or more skilled peers. These helpers can help the child to find out how to do different jobs. Vygotsky thought that there is a range of difficulty that a job needs to be in. If the job is in the range than a child can learn best. Vygotsky called this range the zone of proximal development. The zone of proximal development has jobs that are to hard to do alone but are able to be done with help. The help would come from a helper.\nWhen the helper works with the child social interactions occur. Vygotsky thought that there are two important parts of social interaction: intersubjectivity and scaffolding. Intersubjectivity happens when two people start with different understandings. The two people interact with each other. By interacting, the two people get to the same understanding. Scaffolding happens when a teacher is helping a child. The teacher will change how much they help based on the child\u2019s work level. The teacher will help more if the child needs it. The teacher will also help less if the child does not need help. Over time, the teacher lets the child work alone. When the child works alone he or she puts the conversation into his or her private speech. The private speech is then used to help the child do the problem."}

A fully functioning replica was built in the 1960s by Zuse's company, Zuse KG, and is on permanent display in the Deutsches Museum. The Z3 was Turing-complete.\nBecause of this machine and its predecessors, Konrad Zuse is often regarded as the \"inventor of the computer\"."}

{"id": "406828", "revid": "7819749", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406828", "title": "Schlieffen Plan", "text": "The Schlieffen Plan was a strategic plan made by Count Alfred von Schlieffen, who worked for the German navy. It was made for the army of the German Empire in 1905. It was designed for a war between France on one side and the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, and Italy on the other. Germany and their allies would invade France through Belgium, instead of directly attacking. With help from allies, Germany would have just enough men to beat France in a few months.\nWhen Schlieffen retired in 1906, and the WW1 came up 9 years later, in August 1915, the German officers and tactic leaders dug up the plan that Schlieffen had made and thought that the plan would work like it would in Schlieffen's hypothetical war. However, the plan didn't work, because the plan was outdated and things had changed a lot within the decade.\nEven though he did not have enough men to beat France, Moltke still attacked France through Belgium. He did this because he thought attacking was always better than defending. Moltke was sure that the Russo-Japanese War proved this because Japan always attacked, and Japan won.\nSchlieffen believed that defending was usually better than attacking. Schlieffen said that a defender's men can ride trains to a place faster than an attacker's men can walk there. This meant that the defender would always have enough men to stop the attacker. Schlieffen also said that trenches, machine guns, and barbed wire would help the defender a lot. Schlieffen was right. In WWI, defense was always better until attackers used lots of artillery to help their infantry.\nA similar idea to the Schlieffen Plan was used by Hitler's generals Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian in World War II. In that war, Germany invaded France by attacking Belgium and The Netherlands. Because in the Schlieffen Plan Germany attacked mostly through northern Belgium, France thought Germany would do this again. France put most of her soldiers in north Belgium. But Germany invaded mostly through \"South\" Belgium. German troops marched to the sea and trapped half of the French Army in northern Belgium. Because the trapped French troops were starving and could not get any more food, they surrendered. France tried to continue fighting but was too weak to resist and surrendered."}

He had a rhythmic, relaxed style and played popular music with his own way of expressing feeling and moods.\nEarly life and career.\nKunz was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 1896. His father was a master baker who also played the French horn. Young Charlie began to play in front of an audience as an amateur when he was only six years old. When he was seven, he had become good enough to play as a professional pianist.\nHe came to England in 1922 with a small dance band that was led by the drummer, Ed Krick. Kunz liked London so well that he did not want to leave, so that band returned without him to Pennsylvania. In England, he soon became such a popular pianist that he gave up his own orchestra to just work at his piano playing. He played at ballroom and nightclub venues and also on the BBC radio. Two of Britain's most famous female vocalists were with his band in the 1930s; Vera Lynn and Welsh songstress Dorothy Squires. His best known singer was George Barclay, who was known as a crooner, a popular singing style at that time.\nHis first time playing as a soloist came in 1934 at the Holborn Empire. In that same year, he began to record the first of many solo records of \"Charlie Kunz Medleys\". His most famous song was \"Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie\". Each time he performed, his closing theme was \"Pink Elephants\".\nPersonal life and death.\nHe was married three times. He had one child with his first wife, Amanda Dysher. She later died. In 1923, he married again Eva Dorothy \"Nin\" Lloyd, who was a fashion model. They had two sons. They were married until 1939. His third wife was Pat Sparkes, whom he married in 1942. They were still married when he died. \nHe kept living in England until his death from a heart attack in 1958. He is buried in Streatham Vale Cemetery."}

It forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent. \nOriginally, it included the core of Greenland and the northwestern part of Scotland, known as the Hebridean Terrane. Laurentia is also called the North American Craton. It is a modern geological feature, and it is also a very ancient geological core made of igneous rock. It is nearly four billion years old.\nAt times in the past, Laurentia has been part of larger continents and supercontinents. It is an assembly of smaller tectonic plates which merged early in the Archaean era. As the plates moved together, a huge range of mountains formed. Much later, in the Proterozoic era, small plates and oceanic islands collided with and fused with the ever-growing Laurentia. Together they made the huge, stable craton we see today as the north and center of North America and the west of Greenland. \nOver a billion years ago, the Grenville Orogeny in the Canadian Shield made jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains. Millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.\nThe remaining, western, part of North America was added much later, after Pangaea split up, and the Americas moved west from Eurasia and Gondwana.\nThe craton is named after the Laurentian Mountains, a range to the north of the St. Lawrence River.\nRocks as seen today.\nThe cratonic rocks are metamorphic and igneous, while the overlying sedimentary rocks are composed mostly of limestones, sandstones, and shales. These sedimentary rocks were deposited from 650 to 290 million years ago. In eastern and central Canada, much of the stable craton is exposed at the surface.\nThe southwestern portion of Laurentia consists of Precambrian basement rocks deformed by continental collisions (violet area of the image above). This area has been subjected to considerable rifting as the Basin and Range Province and has been stretched up to 100% of its original width. The area has a history of major volcanic eruptions."}

It is a type of dyskinesia - a disorder that causes movements that happen over and over again, which a person cannot control. \"Tardive\" means these movements do not start right away, or they start slowly.\nTardive dyskinesia is usually caused by taking antipsychotic medicines in high doses, or for a long time. This happens more often with older antipsychotic medicines. Usually, tardive dyskinesia happens when these medicines are taken for many months or years. But some people get tardive dyskinesia after taking these medicines for only 6 weeks.\nCauses.\nThe medicines that are most likely to cause tardive dyskinesia are these older antipsychotic medicines:\nOther medicines that are similar to these antipsychotics can also cause tardive dyskinesia. These medicines are used to treat gastrointestinal problems, like nausea, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying (when the stomach does not empty as quickly as normal). If they are taken for a long time, they can cause tardive dyskinesia:\nNewer antipsychotic medicines (also called \"atypical antipsychotics\") are less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia, but they still can.\nWho gets tardive dyskinesia?\nNobody knows why some people get tardive dyskinesia after taking antipsychotic medicines while others do not. But there are certain groups of people who are more likely to get tardive dyskinesia. The longer a person has been on antipsychotic medicines, the more likely they are to get TD.\nMost people who get tardive dyskinesia are people who have schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, and have been on antipsychotic medicines for a long time. But some other people can get tardive dyskinesia too. Some people have a very high risk of getting tardive dyskinesia. They can get TD even after taking an antipsychotic medicine just once. People that have this very high risk include:\nSymptoms.\nThe symptoms of tardive dyskinesia are movements of the face, lips, tongue, torso, arms, and legs. The person with tardive dyskinesia cannot stop or control these movements. For example, people with tardive dyskinesia often cannot stop themselves from:\nOften, people with tardive dyskinesia also have akathisia. This is a constant urge to move, or always being restless.\nPrevention.\nDoctors can try to prevent tardive dyskinesia by:\nTreatment.\nDiagnosing tardive dyskinesia early is very important. Sometimes, if the drug that is causing TD is stopped early enough, the tardive dyskinesia will go away. This is more likely to happen if the TD is diagnosed soon after its symptoms start.\nSometimes, even if the medication is stopped, the tardive dyskinesia never goes away.\nIf a person with TD still needs antipsychotic medicines, a medication called clozapine (Clozaril) is the best choice. It is a newer antipsychotic, it often works well for schizophrenia that is hard to treat, and it has less of a risk of causing or worsening TD.\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any medicines to treat the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Some doctors use these medications:\nSome small experiments have said that these medicines may be helpful for TD symptoms:"}

It asks experts their opinions. The HGNC gives a long name, and an abbreviation (referred to as a \"symbol\") to every gene.

Example: CAP (which means just \"chromosome-associated protein\") can refer to any of six different genes: (BRD4, CAP1 , LNPEP , PTPLA , SERPINB6 , and SORBS1 ).\nUnlike traditional names like CAP, the HGNC short gene names, or gene symbols, are given to one gene only. This reduces confusion as to which gene is referred to.\nNaming guidelines.\nThe HGNC approach to naming genes and assigning \"symbols\" (gene name abbreviations)is:\nThe full description of HGNC's nomenclature guidelines can be found on their web site . HGNC advocates the appendices \"_v1, _v2..\" to distinguish between different splice variants and \"_pr1, _pr2..\" for promoter variants of a single gene.\nHGNC also states that \"gene nomenclature should \"evolve with new technology\" rather than be restrictive as sometimes occurs when historical and single gene nomenclature systems are applied\".\nProcedure.\nThe HGNC contacts authors who have published on the human gene in question by e-mail. They are asked their opinion on the proposed nomenclature. HGNC also works with other database curators, and experts for specific gene families or sets of genes.\nRevision.\nChanging a standardised gene name after it has got established may cause confusion. The merit of such changes are therefore controversial. For this reason the HGNC changes a gene name only if agreement for that change can be got from most researchers working on that gene."}

Other proteins also help this to happen. Some can also stop it from happening. The whole thing is called \"the regulation of gene expression\". \nPromoters are important parts of the DNA. They work with other regulatory regions. Together, they adjust the level of transcription of a gene. So, genes get switched on when they are needed, and switched off when they are not. When they are on, they get adjusted up or down as needed."}

The game is often played as an organised competitive sport, involving leagues, tournaments, and professional teams.\nPaintball can be played indoors or outdoors, on fields specifically made for the game. The field is scattered with natural or artificial obstacles and terrain, which players use to hide behind. The objective can vary according to the type of game being played. Players may have to capture a flag held by the opposing team, defend or capture a particular point on the field, or simply eliminate all other players on the field until they are the only player or team remaining. Depending on the variant played, games can last from seconds to hours.\nIn many countries, paintball is regulated by specific laws. Players are usually required to wear protective gear (such as masks), and game rules are strictly enforced. Paintball is also used by military forces and law enforcement for training recruits.\nTerrain.\nThe playing field is scattered with several obstacles. These are used to block the view of opponents and prevent them from firing accurately. They may be a shelter, fallen tree, barrels, or a cylindrical tube.

Her brothers included Cesare Borgia, Giovanni Borgia, and Gioffre Borgia.\nLucrezia's family was typical of the ruthless Machiavellian politics and sexual corruption of the times. It was alleged to be characteristic of the Renaissance Papacy. Lucrezia was cast as a \"femme fatale\", a role seen in many artworks, novels, and films.\nVery little is known for sure about Lucrezia. Whether she was involved in the political activities of her father and brothers is unclear. They certainly arranged several marriages for her to important and powerful men. Presumably, this helped their own political ambitions. Lucrezia was married to Giovanni Sforza (Lord of Pesaro), Alfonso of Aragon (Duke of Bisceglie), and Alfonso I d'Este (Duke of Ferrara). Tradition has it that Alfonso of Aragon was an illegitimate son of the King of Naples and that her brother Cesare may have had him murdered when his political value faded.\nAppearance.\nLucrezia is described as having heavy blonde hair which fell past her knees, a beautiful complexion, hazel eyes which changed colour, a full, high bosom, and a natural grace which made her appear to \"walk on air\". These features were highly appreciated in Italy during that period. Another description said that \"her mouth is rather large, the teeth brilliantly white, her neck is slender and fair, and the bust is admirably proportioned\".\nOne painting, \"Portrait of a Youth\" by Dosso Dossi at the National Gallery of Victoria, was identified as a portrait of Lucrezia in November 2008. This painting may be the only surviving formal portrait of Lucrezia Borgia; however, doubts have been cast on that claim. Several other paintings, such as Veneto's fanciful portrait, have also been said to depict her but none has been accepted by scholars at present.\nRumours.\nSeveral rumours have persisted throughout the years, especially about the extravagant parties thrown by the Borgia family. There were allegations of incest, poisoning, and murder on her part, but no historical basis for these rumours has ever been found. Most of the allegations were made by the rivals of the Borgias."}

{"id": "407065", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407065", "title": "Parasitoid wasp", "text": " \nBy far the greater number of wasps (over 500,000 species in the superfamily Chalcidoidea alone) are a special type of parasite. They are parasitoids which lay their eggs in or on the bodies of other insect species (usually the larvae such as caterpillars). \nDifferent species specialise in hosts from different insect orders, most often Lepidoptera, though some select beetles, flies, or bugs; the spider wasps (Pompilidae) exclusively attack spiders.\nAlmost every insect pest species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it. This makes wasps critically important in the natural control of pest numbers (biocontrol). Parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they themselves do little or no damage to crops. Farmers buy these parasitic wasps for insect control in their fields.\nWith most species, the adult parasitic wasps themselves do not get any nutrients from their prey. Much like bees, butterflies, and moths, those which do feed as adults usually get all of their nutrition from nectar. \nParasitic wasps are extremely varied in their habits. Many lay their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa). If the prey is a caterpillar, they paralyze it by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor. Then they insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon the host externally. The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae are mature, dying later when the parasitoids pupate, or when they emerge as adults. Basically, the hosts are eaten alive.\nIchneumons.\nThe Ichneumonoidea is a superfamily of wasp parasitoids. It has two main families:\nPolydnavirus (PDV).\nPolydnaviruses are a unique group of insect viruses that have a mutualistic relationship with parasitic wasps. \nThe virus protects the parasitic larva inside the host by weakening the host\u2019s immune system. It also alters the cells of the host in ways which help the parasite. The polydnavirus, like all viruses, need a host to replicate itself. This it does in the oviducts of the female wasp. \nThe relationship between these viruses and the wasp is obligatory: all individuals are \u2018infected\u2019 with the viruses; the virus has been added to the wasp\u2019s genome.\nThe two main genera of polydnaviruses are the Ichnoviruses (IV) and the Bracoviruses (BV). The ichnoviruses occur in ichneumonid wasp species and bracoviruses in braconid wasps.\nHost defence.\nThe victims of parasitoids do have defences they can use. Many try to hide from the wasps. The egg shells and cuticles of the prey are thickened to prevent the wasp from penetrating them. When the wasp arrives, prey may drop off the plant they are on, or twist and thrash to dislodge the female. Some regurgitate onto the wasp to tangle it up. The wriggling can sometimes help by causing the wasp to miss laying the egg on the host and instead place it nearby. Wriggling of pupae can cause the wasp to lose its grip on the smooth hard pupa or get trapped in the silk strands. Some caterpillars bite wasps that approach it. Some secrete poisonous compounds that kill or drive away the parasitoid. Ants that are in a symbiotic relationship with caterpillars, aphids or scale insects defend them from attack by wasps.\nEven parasitoid wasps are vulnerable to hyperparasitoid wasps. Some parasitoid wasps change the behaviour of the infected host to build a silk web around the pupa of the wasps after they emerge from its body to protect them from hyperparasitoids.\nIn endoparasitoids, host immune cells can encapsulate the eggs and larvae of parasitoid wasps. In aphids, a secondary endosymbiont, \"Buchnera aphidicola\" carries a latent phage. This phage makes the aphid relatively immune to their parasitoid wasps by killing many of the eggs. However, wasps counter this by laying more eggs in aphids that have the endosymbiont so that at least one of them can hatch and parasitize the aphid.\nCertain caterpillars eat plants that are toxic to both themselves and the parasite to cure themselves. \"Drosophila melanogaster\" larvae also \"self-medicate\" with ethanol to treat parasitism. \"D. melanogaster\" females lay their eggs in food containing toxic amounts of alcohol if they detect parasitoid wasps nearby. Despite the alcohol slowing the growth of the flies, it protects them from the wasps.\nEvolution.\nParasitoidism evolved only once in the Hymenoptera, during the Permian. It lead to a single clade, the Apocrita. Almost all parasitoid wasps are descended from this clade. \nThe parasitic lifestyle has been lost several times, including among the ants, bees, and yellowjacket wasps. As a result, the order Hymenoptera has many families of parasitoids intermixed with non-parasitoid groups. The Hymenoptera, Apocrita, and Aculeata are all clades, and each has both parasitic and non-parasitic species. The parasitoid wasps do not form a clade on their own. \nThe parasitoid wasps include some very large groups. Some estimates suggest the Chalcidoidea has 500,000 species, the Ichneumonidae 100,000 species, and the Braconidae up to 50,000 species.\nHost insects have evolved a range of defences against parasitoid wasps, including hiding, wriggling, and camouflage markings.\nA big increase of species in the Hymenoptera occurred soon after the evolution of parasitoidy in the order. The parasitoidy may have been a main cause of it. The evolution of a 'wasp waist' (a constriction in the abdomen) helped the Apocrita because it increased manoeuverability of the ovipositor (the organ used to lay eggs)."}

With time, mathematicians came to understand their depth (in some cases), rather than treat them as puzzles. The equation is named after Diophantus of Alexandria, a mathematician, who described them first. The restriction on integer coefficients makes sense, when one is concerned about finding Divisors, or in the case of modular arithmetic. In everyday life, many equations solve problems where only whole numbers make sense: A product is composed of many parts, but only whole pieces can be produced. \nSome diophantine equations are very famous. These include the Pythagorean triple, Fermat's Last Theorem and Pell's equation. Hilbert's tenth problem was to find an algorithm to decide, whether a given Diophantine equation has an integer solution. "}

{"id": "407164", "revid": "115351", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407164", "title": "Money (Pink Floyd song)", "text": "\"Money\" is a song by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. The song was on their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". It was written by their bassist/co-lead singer Roger Waters, and it was the first song on the second side of the original album. Money is the only song on the album to enter the top 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Money\" is noted for its unusual 7/4\u20134/4 time signature, and the sounds of money-related objects that begins the song.\nComposition.\nOne of Gilmour's ideas for the solo section was that, for the second chorus of the solo, all special effects would be completely off (referred to as \"dry\"), creating the sense of just four musicians playing in a small room. For this \"dry\" chorus, all musicians played softly and subtly, with Gilmour's solo, now one single guitar, playing very little. Then, for the third chorus, the dynamics would suddenly rise, with heavy use of reverb and echo (a \"wet\" sound), additional rhythm-guitar parts in the background, and the drums becoming heavy and almost chaotic.\nThe notes and chords are based on the regular twelve-bar blues in the musical key of B minor, with the sung melody and nearly all of Gilmour's solo based on the pentatonic and blues scales. Two twelve-bar verses are followed by a twenty-bar instrumental section that features a blues-style tenor saxophone solo (played by Dick Parry) along with keyboard, bass and drums and a further two-bar intro in 4/4 leading to the guitar solo, which is structured like a twelve-bar blues, but doubled to a twenty-four-bar length.\nThe lyrics are quickly talked about in the movie \"Pink Floyd The Wall\", when the main character, Pink, is caught writing poems in class by his teacher. The teacher takes the poem from him and reads it in a very mean manner, wanting Pink's classmates to laugh. The poem is a part of the lyrics to \"Money\".\nRecording.\nThe first rough recordings of the song, including some of the sound effects, were recorded in a small recording studio Roger Waters had in his garden shed. As recorded by the band, the song has a sad feel, unlike Waters' original version, which he later talked about as \"prissy and very English\". As heard on \"\", the demo is in G-sharp minor, as opposed to the B minor of the final version. The instrumental section was worked on by both Gilmour and Waters, with Gilmour overseeing the time change as well as his own guitar and voice work, and Richard Wright and Nick Mason making up their own parts. Dick Parry added the tenor saxophone solo that comes before the guitar solo. Gilmour's advice is also seen in the final mix, which features \"wet\" and \"dry\" sections. To produce the special high notes that make up the final chorus of his solo, Gilmour played a special Lewis guitar with twenty-four frets, allowing a large variety of notes.\nOne of the special elements of \"Money\" are the sound effects that begin the song. These were made by putting together recordings Waters had made of clinking coins, a ringing cash register, tearing paper, a clicking counting machine and other items.\nIn the video \"Classic Albums: Pink Floyd \u2013 The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon\", engineer Alan Parsons talked about the recording of the band's first backing track for the song: They used the sound-effect tape loop as a sort of metronome, but Parsons gradually faded out the loop before the vocals started. As the song went on, the band slowly sped up, yet later, between the second verse and the saxophone solo, Parsons briefly raised up the volume of the effects loop, and just by coincidence, it turned out to fit the beat. After this point, the loop is not heard again.\nRe-recording.\nThe song was re-recorded for the 1981 Pink Floyd album, \"A Collection of Great Dance Songs\", because Capitol Records refused to let Columbia Records have the track in the US. With the help of producer James Guthrie, Gilmour re-recorded the song, providing vocals and playing all the instruments except saxophone (resulting in a much simpler drum part). Parry again added the sax solo, redoing his role on the original recording.\nThe music video for \"Money\" features scenes of various ways of making and spending money, and includes brief closeups of a coin spinning.\nPersonnel.\nwith:"}

According to tradition, the two lines, the Agiads and Eurypontids, were descended from the twins Eurysthenes and Procles. These twins were said to be the descendants of Heracles, who conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War. The dynasties were named after the twins' grandsons, the kings Agis I and Eurypon.

Sullivan told Gilbert three weeks after the opening that he would not write another comic opera, and it appeared their collaboration was over. \"Princess Ida\" has its roots in the work of a poet little read today, and its themes are somewhat dated. The operetta is not a modern audience favorite. \nStory.\nIn her babyhood, Princess Ida was betrothed to Prince Hilarion. In her young womanhood however, she has forsaken the company of men and has set up an all-female university.

It was also one of the first operating systems with a Graphical user interface, the VAXstation was a very popular workstation at the time. OpenVMS uses virtual memory, and was originally developed as a time sharing, batch processing system. It was made for transaction processing, and is a real-time system. The jobs users submit can have a higher priority than those of the operating system. The operating system offers high availability through clustering: The system load can be distributed over multiple computers. That way, the system is \"disaster-tolerant\": One machine that fails will not shut the operation down.\nOpenVMS introduced many features that became standard in later operating systems:\nToday, OpenVMS is used in many enterprises where availability and uptime are critical: These include banks and insurance companies. System up-times of over a decade have been reported. A feature called \"rolling upgrade\" allows to upgrade software or hardware without the need to shut the system down. A data center that is destroyed will not lead to downtime either, if the system is configured properly. Customers using OpenVMS include banks and financial services, hospitals and healthcare, network information services, and large-scale industrial manufacturers of various products."}

There may be a green shade along the gills of freshly collected specimens.\nBignose sharks may reach lengths to 9.8 feet (3 metres), and weigh as much as 370 pounds (168 kg). At birth, Bignose shark pups are between 2 and 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) in length. Males reach maturity at 7.1 feet (2.2 metres) in length, and females at 7.4-9.3 feet (2.3-2.8 metres). \nHabitat.\nBignose sharks have been recorded in tropical and subtropical regions. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it is found from Florida (U.S.A), south to Venezuela, while in the eastern Atlantic it has been reported from Senegal to Ghana including the Mediterranean Sea. Reports show that they have been found in the western Indian Ocean including the Red Sea, Mozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, and India. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found off China in the west, Hawaii in the central, and Gulf of California, Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador in the east.\nThis large offshore species is found near the edges of continental shelves and insular slopes at depths from near the surface to 1,410 feet (430 metres). The adults often swim at depths greater than 295 feet (90 metres) while the young swim in shallower waters. \nReproduction.\nThe Bignose sharks are viviparous, meaning that they give live birth instead of laying eggs. One litter of Bignose sharks can contain 3-11 pups which are 60-90 cm long. Male bignose sharks reach maturity at around 2 metres in length, while females reach maturity between 2.3-2.8 metres. Females give birth at different times of the year depending on where they are found. In the Mediterranean Sea, Bignose sharks are known to give birth from August to September, while off the coast of Madagascar, birth occurs during September and October. \nFeeding.\nThe Bignose shark feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fish (including lizardfish, croakers, flatfish, mackerels, soles, and batfish), cartilaginous fish (including \"Squalus\" dogfish, \"Holohalaelurus\" catsharks, \"Dasyatis\" stingrays, and chimaeras), and cephalopods. \nOther names.\nIn English, the Bignose shark is also known as the \"Knopp's shark\". Other names of the Bignose shark in other languages are \"Baboso\" (Spanish), \"Grootneushaai\" (Afrikaan), \"Grootsnuithaai\" (Dutch), \"Karcharinos megalorynchos\" (Greek), \"Marracho baboso\" (Portuguese), \"Requin babosse\" (French), \"Squalo naso grande\" (Italian), \"Tibur\u00f3n baboso\" (Spanish), \"Tibur\u00f3n nariz\u00f3n\" (Spanish), and \"Tubar\u00e3o-baboso\" (Portuguese). \nHuman interaction.\nThe Bignose shark is caught by offshore trawlers, and rarely by hook and line. It is harvested in the Caribbean region with deep longlines and is used as fish meal for animal feed, and for oil. In U.S waters, this species is currently banned from capture in the commercial shark fishery. \nAlthough this shark is large, it poses little threat to humans due to its deepwater habitat. \nConservation.\nThe Bignose shark is listed as Data Deficient throughout its range, with the exception of Australia, where it is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. \"Data Deficient\" means that there is no need for further information on fisheries and population status for this species.\nThe longline fishery for Bignose sharks is managed and regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service off the coast of the U.S. Bignose sharks are banned from harvest in U.S. waters. If this species is caught, it must be released immediately into the water in a manner that maximizes the shark's survival. "}

It was done in 1931. It is one of his most famous paintings.\nThe painting was first shown in 1932. It has been in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City since 1934. The painting typifies what critics call \"surrealism\".\nIt is easy to recognise and is often used in popular culture.\nDescription.\nThe painting was the first to have a melting pocket watch, called a \"soft watch\". Some people thought that the soft watch was inspired by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Dal\u00ed said that the watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by Camembert cheese melting in the sun.\nThere is a human in the middle of the painting. The orange clock at the bottom left is covered in ants. Dal\u00ed often used ants in his paintings as a symbol for death.\n\"The Persistence of Memory\" uses \"the exactitude of realist painting techniques\". In practice, the painting looks more like something a person might see in a dream, rather than awake.\nLandscape.\nThe rocks to the right are supposed to be a tip of the Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia. Many of Dal\u00ed's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of Catalonia. There is a strange shadow in the foreground of the painting, which is a reference to Mount Pani.\nVersions.\nDal\u00ed returned to this idea with \"The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory\" (1954). This painting is in the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. The first \"Persistence of Memory\" is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dal\u00ed also made many lithographs and sculptures of soft watches."}

The movie, \"The Simpsons Movie\", took the number one spot. This is DreamWorks Animation's first movie and only traditionally animated movie to win an Oscar.\nPlot.\nIn Ancient Egypt, the Hebrews have become slaves and pray to return to the Promised Land (\"Deliver Us\"). Meanwhile, a female slave called Yocheved and her children, Miriam and Aaron, witness several male infants being ruthlessly taken and butchered by the soldiers of Pharaoh Seti I, who fears that an increase in Hebrew men would culminate in rebellion. Fearing for her own son's safety, she places him in a basket on the Nile. The basket arrives at Pharaoh's palace and Miriam witnesses her brother being taken in by Pharaoh's wife, who names him Moses.\nTwenty years later, Moses and his adoptive brother Rameses accidentally destroy a temple while racing their chariots, for which Pharaoh reprimands them. Moses tries to take the blame and tells Pharaoh that Rameses only wanted his approval. At a palace banquet that evening, Pharaoh appoints Rameses as Prince Regent and gives him authority over all the temples in Egypt. Moses is later given Tzipporah, a Midian girl the priests Hotep and Huy captured as a concubine, after she nearly attacks Rameses. Moses ends up humiliating Tzipporah by pushing her into a pool at the palace, and Rameses later appoints him as Royal Chief Architect.\nLater that night, Moses helps Tzipporah escape from the palace and, by chance, runs into his siblings Miriam and Aaron. Miriam tries to explain to Moses about his true past, but he refuses to listen and runs back to the palace. He later has a nightmare in which he witnesses several Hebrew infants being thrown in the Nile and later, Seti reveals that he \"sacrificed\" the Hebrew children, to prevent retaliation. The next day, Moses witnesses an Egyptian overseer whipping an elderly Hebrew slave. He unintentionally kills the guard by pushing him off a scaffolding. Although Rameses pleads with Moses to stay and that he is innocent, Moses bids him farewell, before exiling himself into the desert.\nMoses then arrives in the land of the Midianites, a tribe of which Tzipporah is a member. He is welcomed into the tribe by the High Priest and Tzipporah's father Jethro and becomes a part of their community (\"Through Heaven's Eyes\"). He and Tzipporah later marry. When chasing a stray sheep into a cave, Moses encounters a burning bush. Through this, the voice of God instructs him to return to Egypt and guide the enslaved Hebrews to the Promised Land. He bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that He will tell Moses what to say.\nMoses and Tzipporah then travel to Egypt and discover that while he was absent, the slaves' treatment has worsened and Pharaoh and his wife have since died, resulting in Rameses taking over. He happily greets Moses. When Moses asks Rameses to free the Hebrews and demonstrates his alliance with God by turning his staff into an Egyptian cobra, Hotep and Huy boastfully recreate this transformation (\"Playing With The Big Boys Now\"), only to have their snakes eaten by Moses'. Rather than relenting, Rameses doubles the Hebrews' workload. Moses and Tzipporah then encounter Aaron and Miriam, the former berating Moses for not feeling sorry for the years of slavery the Hebrews have endured. Miriam later convinces her brother and the other slaves to trust them. God later inflicts the Ten Plagues on Egypt, however Rameses is undeterred and refuses to give in to Moses' request.\nMoses then prepares the Hebrews for the final plague by instructing them to paint their doorposts with lamb's blood. The final plague-the Angel of Death-sweeps through the city, killing the firstborn Egyptians-including Rameses' son-and sparing the Hebrew children. A grief-stricken Rameses then allows Moses and the Hebrews to leave.\nThe next day, Moses, Aaron, Miriam and Tzipporah along with the other Hebrews leave Egypt and arrive at the Red Sea (\"When You Believe\"). Rameses and his army then arrive and pursue them, and Moses parts the sea with his staff. The Hebrews are guided safely across and the waters close on the Egyptian army, while Rameses is spared and thrown onto the rocks. Moses then bids his brother a final, emotional farewell, before leading the Hebrews to Mount Sinai, where he receives the Ten Commandments from God.\nCast.\nDirector Brenda Chapman briefly voices Miriam when she sings the lullaby to Moses. The vocal had been recorded for a scratch audio track, which was intended to be replaced later by Sally Dworsky. The track turned out so well that it remained in the film."}

It is a process used in manufacturing. A mould is a hollow container that will hold the liquid material until it turns solid. The liquid hardens or sets inside the mould, adopting its shape. Materials commonly used in moulding include plastic, metal, glass and ceramic.\nTyres are made using moulds, where the molten rubber is poured into the mould and then left to set. Moulds can vary greatly in size. They are usually made of hardened steel which can resist wearing.\nTypes of moulds.\nCompression.\nCompression moulds work by taking the empty mould and placing a piece of unshaped rubber inside. The mould is then pressed shut using high heat and pressure forcing the rubber to liquify and flow into the recess created for the part while excess rubber is forced into the moulds dump groove. It is important when making a mould to keep in mind that when the part cools it will shrink slightly.\nInjection.\nInjection moulds work under the same principle as compression moulds except that instead of pressing the mould together on the rubber the mould is first closed and the liquid rubber is then injected into a fill hole drilled into the mould. This is used more for plastic products.\nPress Mold.\nPress type of mold includes bending, trimming, edging, and drawing. Some parts are molded through several procedures, and a progressive press molding is used to perform these procedures sequentially.\nPlastics Mold.\nA plastics mold is used to mold parts by melting a molding material such as plastics with heat and pressure into the mold."}

It was first published in 1967, and banned in the Soviet Union in 1968.\nThe novel tells the story of a small group of cancer patients in Uzbekistan in 1955. This was the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. It explores the moral responsibility of those who stood by whilst their fellow citizens were arrested, sent to labor camps, exiled or executed.\nStalin's Great Purge, when millions were unjustly killed, was a campaign of political repression in the Soviet Union. It was orchestrated by Joseph Stalin from 1936 to 1939. It involved a large-scale purge of the Communist Party and government officials and the Red Army leadership, and repression of the peasants. There was widespread police surveillance, suspicion of \"saboteurs\", imprisonment, and arbitrary executions. In Russian historiography the period of the most intense purge, 1937\u20131938, is called Yezhovshchina (; literally, \"the Yezhov regime\"), after Nikolai Yezhov, the head of the Soviet secret police, the NKVD.\nOne of the patients had denounced a man eighteen years before to get the whole apartment they were living in together. He fears that the man, now free, might seek revenge. Others come to realize that their passivity, their failure to resist, makes them as guilty as any other. \"You haven't had to do much lying, do you understand?\" Shulubin tells the main character, Oleg Kostoglotov, who was in a labor camp. \"At least you haven't had to stoop so low \u2013 you should appreciate that! You people were arrested, but we were herded into meetings to 'expose' you. They executed people like you, but they made us stand up and applaud the verdicts ... And not just applaud, they made us demand the firing squad, \"demand\" it!\" \nToward the end of the novel, Kostoglotov \u2013 who, like Solzhenitsyn, was forced into exile under \"Article 58\", which dealt with counter-revolutionaries \u2013 realizes that the damage done to him, and to Russia, was too great. There will be no healing, no normal life now that Stalin has gone. On the day of his release from the cancer ward, toward the end of the novel, he visits a zoo, seeing in the animals people he knew: \"[E]ven supposing Oleg took their side and had the power, he would still not want to break into the cages and liberate them ... [D]eprived of their home surroundings, they had lost the idea of rational freedom. It would only make things harder for them, suddenly to set them free\"."}

It was a pioneering study in media theory. McCluhan was a Professor of literature who was deeply interested in the way media had changed society.\nThe book proposes that media themselves affect their content in important ways. It is an attempt to understand how changing media have affected society. McLuhan suggests that media play a role, not by the content delivered, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. \nMcLuhan pointed to the light bulb as an example. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, but it is a medium that has a social effect. The light bulb lets people do things at nighttime which would be impossible in darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that \"a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence\". \nMore controversially, he thought that content had little effect on society \u2014 for example, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming \u2014 the effect of television on society would be identical. He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it. He made the point that reading, by its very nature, is a sequential medium. One reads it in a sequence. On the other hand, a medium like film presents information more holistically. There is a kind of \"all at once-ness\" about films and television.\nThe book is the source of the well-known phrase \"The medium is the message\". It was a leading indicator of the upheaval of local cultures by increasingly globalized values. The book's influence spread much further than academics, writers, and social theorists. It was widely read. It became a corner-stone in media studies courses."}

The plumage of this attractive species is highly variable: virtually no two birds look alike, with a yellowish white, blue and green head, greenish-bronze upperparts, violet blue-green wings, grey feet, and reddish eye. Its tail feathers are blue with broad yellow tips. Both sexes are similar.\nThere are two different colour morphs: a more common \u2018yellow-brown\u2019 morph, and a less common \u2018green\u2019 morph. Although both morphs are broadly similar in appearance, the upperparts of the 'green' morph are mainly dull-green and the head is bluish white.\nRange and habitat.\nThe Saint Vincent amazon is endemic to the heavily forested mountains of the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent in the Lesser Antilles.\nIt lives in rainforests in the island's central mountains, from ; it prefers mountains and valleys at low elevation because there are larger, mature trees needed for the nests.\nBiology.\nThe Saint Vincent amazons live in groups and feed on the upper parts of large trees. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, seeds, flowers and leaves of several species of the rainforest.\nThey breed between January and June (mostly February-May) and their nests are in holes in mature, large trees. The female usually lays two to three eggs.\nStatus.\nThe combined effects of habitat loss, hunting for food, the capture to trade them as pets, and natural disasters (volcanoes and hurricanes, made that the number of Saint Vincent Amazon declined through the 20th century.\nDue to all these contributing factors, the St. Vincent parrot is considered Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I and II of CITES.\nConservation.\nA group of conservation measures has been able to avoid the extinction of the St Vincent Amazon, including: the enforcement of international and domestic legislation protecting this species from hunting and trade; the protection of habitat through the establishment of the St Vincent Parrot Reserve; and the delivery of successful public education campaigns.\nOn October 27, 1979, \"A. guildingii\" was declared the national bird of St. Vincent and the Grenadines as part of the country's first independence celebration."}

There are many different types of decorations used depending on the traditions of each culture. The inside and outside of homes are often decorated with lights and figures. They are also often hung in public areas, from street lights and community spaces.\nPopular holiday plants include holly, mistletoe, ivy, red amaryllis, and Christmas cactus. Christmas trees are decorated with many ornaments.\nThe traditional colours of Christmas are green (evergreen), white (snow), and red. Gold and silver are also very common. Typical symbols of the holiday include baby Jesus, Santa Claus and the star of Bethlehem. Symbols of winter are also used, including snowflakes and snowmen.\nTypes of decorations.\nGlass ornaments.\nFigural glass Christmas ornaments originated in the small town of Lauscha, Germany in the latter half of the 19th century. The town had long produced fine glassware. The production of Christmas ornaments became a family affair for many people. Some families invested 16 hours a day in production. For some, it was their sole source of income.\nSometimes competitions were held. Prizes were awarded to the family producing the finest examples. Santa Clauses, angels, birds, animals, and other traditional Yuletide subjects were favorites.\nF.W. Woolworth discovered these glass ornaments on a toy and doll buying trip to Sonnenburg, Germany in the 1890s. He sold them in his \"five and ten cent\" stores in America. The ornaments were said to have contributed to Woolworth's great business success.\nFor the American market, figures were blown depicting comic book characters as well as patriotic subjects such as Uncle Sams, eagles, and flags. Glassblowers have held on to the old molds. Glass ornaments are still created from these old molds.\nMethod.\nA clear glass tube is heated over an open flame. It is then inserted into a mold. The glassblower then blows into the end of the tube. The glass expands to fill the mold. The glass takes on the shape of the mold. It is cooled. A silver nitrate solution is swirled about inside the ornament. This gives the ornament a silver glow. The outside of the ornament is painted or decorated with metal trims, paper clippings, etc.\nCotton batting.\nCotton batting Christmas ornaments were popular during the years of the German Christmas toy and decoration boom at the turn of the century. They were exported in large numbers to the United States. These decorations suggested puffs of snow. Fruits and vegetables were popular subjects and often had a realistic appearance. African American and patriotic characters were fashioned for the American market. Some ornaments were used to hide boxes of candy.\nAssembling these decorations was a cottage industry. Cotton batting was wound around a wire frame resembling a human or animal. A face was either painted on or a lithograph cut-out was affixed to the batting. Figures were given crepe paper costumes. Some were touched with glue and sprinkled with flakes of mica for a glittering appearance.\nDresden.\nDresdens are three-dimensional ornaments. They are made of paper, card, or cardboard. Dresdens were produced mostly in Dresden and Leipzig, Germany, from the 1860s to WWI. They were originally priced between 1 and 60 cents. Subjects included animals and birds, suns and moons, humans, carriages and ships, etc. Some Dresdens were flat, allowing the buyer to collect them in scrapbooks.\nPositive and negative molds were set into a press. A moistened sheet of card was put into the press. The images were pressed. When they had dried, they were sent to cottage workers for the finishing touches. This involved separating the form-halves from the card, trimming ragged edges, and gluing the two halves together. The form was then gilded, silvered, or hand-painted. Sometimes a small gift or sweet was put into the form. Forms were usually no larger than five inches."}

They are one of the richest families of insects: there are between 50,000 and 150,000 species worldwide. The species are grouped into 45 subfamilies and about 1,000 genera.\nParasitism.\nMost braconids are parasitoids (both external and internal) on other insects. Their victims are the larvae of Coleoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera, and also some hemimetabolous insects such as aphids and bugs. \nMost species kill their hosts, though some cause the hosts to become sterile and less active. The endoparasitoid species lay their eggs inside the victim. They have elaborate adaptations which improve larval survival inside the host. They have endosymbiotic viruses which disable the host immune defences. These polydnaviruses are often used by the wasps instead of a venom cocktail. \nThe DNA of the wasp actually has bits which are the templates for the viral particles. A study suggested these arrangements had started about 100 million years ago.\nThese viruses suppress the larva's immune system and allow the parasitoid to grow inside the host undetected. Through the evolutionary history of being used by the wasps, these viruses apparently have become so modified, they appear unlike any other known viruses today. Because of this highly modified system of host immunosuppression, a high level of parasitoid-host specificity is not surprising. In other words, the viruses need to be a bit different for every host species.\nParasitism on adult insects (particularly on Hemiptera and Coleoptera) also happens. Members of two subfamilies are known to form galls on plants."}

There are more than thirty paintings in the series.\nIn the middle of winter in 1892, Monet lived in rooms across from Rouen Cathedral. He stayed until spring, painting its fa\u00e7ade many times. Most versions were painted as seen here: close up and cropped at the sides. He returned the next winter to paint the cathedral again. He made more than thirty views of it. It was not the Gothic fa\u00e7ade that was Monet's subject. It was the atmosphere that surrounded the cathedral. \"To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor,\" Monet said, \"What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me.\"\nAll of the paintings in the series were made in 1892 and 1893. They were reworked in Monet's studio in 1894. In 1895, he chose what he considered to be the twenty best paintings from the series, and displayed them at his gallery in Paris.

It is in the north-eastern side of the country. As part of the New England region, Connecticut has undergone much geologic change. It has been shaped by plate tectonics, volcanism, and glacial activity.\nAppalachian Mountains.\nDuring the early Triassic Era, the super-continent Pangea was formed as the Iapetus Ocean closed up and the proto-North American continent collided with Avalonia (modern day Africa). This caused great uplift and the creation of the Appalachian Mountains. The erosion of the Appalachian Mountains now exposes and lifts up metamorphic rocks that used to be very deep in the Earth's.\nEastern Border Fault.\nAbout 200 million years after this collision and the formation of Pangea, during the middle of the Mesozoic Era, the Atlantic Ocean floor started spreading. This caused a lot of stress. This caused a geologic fault. Connecticut's famous Eastern Border Fault was created. As a result, the land west of this fault was downset, creating a rift valley and causing the land to tilt an average of 15 to 25 degrees. The fault is currently inactive. The formation of this basin eventually refilled with soft fluvial and alluvial sediments.\nIce Age.\nDuring Ice Ages, glacial activity shaped much of New England's landscape, eroding mountains, leaving glacial till scattered everywhere, and forming glacial lakes. At its greatest extent, one of these glaciers leaves behind a moraine which became Long Island. \nOne of the biggest glacial lakes of the time was Glacial Lake Hitchcock. It formed when the Laurentide ice sheet retreated and glacial meltwater began to accumulate at the glacier\u2019s terminal moraine in Rocky Hill, Connecticut and back up into the Connecticut River. The glacial lake left behind a soft, varved landscape, gathering silt and sand in the summertime due to the influx of glacial meltwater and clay in the wintertime as the lake froze until it was later drained.\nRiver Valley.\nRiver Valley has a soft surface. It is also high in nutrients and host the majority of Connecticut's farmland soils. The land on either side of the Connecticut River Valley is less suitable for farmlands. The eastern section holds the shallow Proto-North American Terrane while the western section contains the Iapetos and Avalonian Terranes. These places still holds remnants of glacial till and lack the soft fluvial sediments so prominent in the Connecticut River Valley region."}

Under the name of \"royal colony\", the first of what would later become known as Crown colonies was the English Colony of Virginia. This happened in 1624 after the Crown removed the Royal Charter it had given to the Virginia Company.\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century, the term \"Crown Colony\" was only used to refer to those colonies which had been obtain through wars.

He became blind quickly when he was 17 years old, and he stopped playing the sport of football. He started athletics after losing his eyesight. He first raced at the 1998 Vigo half marathon. He later competed at IPC European and World Championships. He also competed at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 2008 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics but did not win any medals at these Games.\nPersonal.\nNieves was born on March 9, 1982 in Vilalba, Lugo. He moved to Germany when he was a baby, and he moved back to Spain when five years old.\nNieves has a disability: he has only some eyesight. He lost his eyesight when he was 17 years old. It happened very fast and was a surprise. It is not understood what caused it or if his eyesight will continue to get worse. Before losing his eyesight, he played football as a midfielder for S\u00e1rdoma in Spain's Divisi\u00f3n de Honor Juvenil de F\u00fatbol, and had tried out for Celta de Vigo football team. He quit the sport after his eyesight got bad.\nBetween 2004 and 2012, Nieves was a student training to be a mining engineer at the University of Vigo. He wanted to study biology but his eyesight meant he could not use a microscope, so he did engineering instead. He can speak some English, and can argue with people in English at athletic events. In 2012, his girlfriend was named Juliana.\nAthletics.\nNieves is a T12/B2 track and field athlete, who started running when he was 17 after his eyesight got bad. Because no one in his family ran, he started running at a park in Castrelos Vigo but not with the idea of doing it at the highest level. His first race was the 1998 Vigo half marathon. He was a member of the the Celta Vigo athletics club, then joined the Gymnastic Society of Pontevedra athletic club, before leaving the club to join the Alejandro Gomez Athletics Club.\nNieves competed in the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Australia. He finished sixth in the 10,000\u00a0meter race. He decided not to compete at the 2004 Summer Paralympics so that he could focus on school. He needed a job because athletics did not give him enough money for him to race all the time. After the 2004 Games, more money was there for Paralympic athletes and he was able to race more.\nNieves competed at the 2008 Spanish national championships, and finished first in the 10,000\u00a0meter T12 race. He competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China. After the 2008 Games, he changed coaches to Pablo Diaz and joined Gymnastic Society of Pontevedra athletic club. In 2009, he practiced in Pontevedra and Lugo, and he was coached by Pablo Diaz. In 2009, he had a goal of trying to go to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. At the 2009 IPC European Athletics Championships, he finished first in two races and finished second in another. He also set a world record in the 10,000\u00a0meters. His second first-place finish was in the 5,000\u00a0meters and the second-place finish was in the 1,500\u00a0meters. In 2009, he set a world record in the T12 10,000\u00a0meter event during a race in Galacia.\nIn 2010, Nieves set a world record in the T12 10,000\u00a0meter race. 40 days later at a race in Jerez de la Frontera, he set a world record in 10,000\u00a0meters. He competed in the 2011 Pontevedra half marathon. In 2011, he injured the third metatarsal. His physical therapy after the injury involved training in the pool. He started competing again in late September 2011 at a race in Berlin.\nIn March 2012, Nieves was training up to four hours a day at the Galician Sports Modernization Center (CGTD). He finished first in the 2012 San Silvestre Candelaria 4,500\u00a0meter race. He competed at the 2012 Spanish national Paralympic athletic championships where he came in first in the 5,000\u00a0meters. A few months before the London Paralympics, he had problems with his tendons. He did not compete in the 2012 European Championships because of his tendon injury. As a 28 year old, he raced at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, finishing fourth in the 5,000\u00a0meters. His time was 4\u00a0seconds slower than his personal best.\nNieves competed in the 2013 San Silvestre Candelaria 4,500\u00a0meter race. In May 2013, he competed at the Kern Sauleda Pharme-Grand Prix to try to get to be allowed to race at the IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, France in the 5,000\u00a0meter race. Later that month, he tried to be eligible for the World Championships in the 10,000\u00a0meter race at a race in Huesca. Nieves has a goal of trying to compete in the 2016 Summer Paralympics."}

She received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1923. She was the third female to win the award. Millay was also a feminist. She used the name Nancy Boyd during her career. Millay's fame began around 1912 when she entered a poem, \"Renascence\", in a contest in \"The Lyric Year\".\nEarly life.\nOn February 22, 1892, Edna St. Vincent Millay, one of the best American poets, was born in Rockland, Maine. When she was eight years old, her mother Cora, left her father because he could not support the family; therefore, Cora raised her three daughters on her own and changed Millay\u2019s future career in a huge way. When she was a young girl, Millay decided to train her writing skills even though she moved many times and didn't have much money. A few years later, they lived in Cora\u2019s Aunt\u2019s house, where she began writing her first poem.\nHow She Became an Author.\nEdna St. Vincent Millay became a famous author by adding the newest point of view with old ones to form a special American poetry. Her first poem, \u201cForest Trees,\u201d was written when she was fourteen and appeared in \"St. Nicholas Magazine\". Within the next four years, \"St. Nicholas\" published five more of her poems. Three years later, her poem, \u201cThe Land of Romance,\u201d got the gold award of The \"St. Nicholas League\" and was reprinted in \"Current Literature\" in April. In 1913, she took several classes at Barnard College, where she prepared for moving to Vassar. The days in Vassar College also changed Millay\u2019s career. This college became a good place to develop her talent. She became a writer for Vassar Miscellany and a good school songwriter. Until the year of 1917, Millay left a lot of work for Vassar College.\nInfluences on Her Writings.\nAfter Cora, Millay\u2019s mother, left her husband, she raised her three children and helped them to learn American language arts by reading old books with them. When Millay got older, she went to Vassar College, where she learned how to be a good poet. In 1923, Millay married 43-year-old Eugen Jan Boissevain, who supported Millay\u2019s career and took care of housework for her. These events made Edna St. Vincent Millay a successful American writer.\nHer Major Works.\nIn her life, Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a lot of plays and poetry collections. The most famous one is \"The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver.\" This book won her the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1923. Also, as a good writer, she wrote five plays early in her living. For example, \"The Lamp and the Bell\" would be the best play she wrote in the 1920s. Published in 1921, \"The Lamp and the Bell\" was a play written for Vassar College about love between women. Moreover, she also wrote down \"The King's Henchman\" in 1927. This opera was described as \u201cthe most effectively and artistically wrought American opera ever to reach the stage.\u201d\nHer Influence on Society.\nDuring her 58 years of life, Edna St. Vincent Millay left many works that have made a change in American society. She once said, \u201cthis book, when I am dead, will be a little faint perfume of me. People who knew me well will say she really used to think that way.\u201d By leaving this famous sentence, Millay supported Americans to put out their thoughts in words. In addition, she also made young Americans think that they had the ability to change the world by saying, \u201cthe young generation forms a country of its own. It has no geographical boundaries. ... These young people are going to do things. They are going to change things.\" She tried to change the society by supporting these young people to believe in themselves.\nThe End of Her Life.\nOn October 19, 1950, Millay was found in her house, alone, without a breath. Several years before, Millay had a nervous breakdown and stopped writing. Although she slowly got better because of her husband\u2019s care, her husband, Eugen Jan Boissevain, died in 1949 due to serious cancer. One year after, Millay fell down in her house and was found eight hours after her death. Later on, Nancy Milford, the writer who also wrote \"million-selling Zelda\", published the first biography about Millay\u2019s life in the book, \"Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St Vincent Millay\" in 2001, giving the entire world a chance to get to know the life of this famous author."}

On July 6, 2013, the aircraft crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. There were 307 people (291 passengers and 16 crew) aboard the plane. Two passengers were killed and 182 were hurt. A third passenger also died, but it is possible that she survived the crash and was run over by a fire truck. When the plane was coming in to land, the engines were idle and the plane was flying much slower than it should have been. 1.5 seconds before the plane crashed, the pilots tried a go-around, but they were too late.\nThe aircraft which crashed was a Boeing 777-200ER, and it had been used by Asiana Airlines since March 2006. The crash was the first time anyone ever died aboard a Boeing 777.\nAircraft.\nThe aircraft used on Flight 214 was a Boeing 777-28EER. The plane's registration number was HL7742, and it had Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4090 engines. The plane was delivered to Asiana Airlines in March 2006. The aircraft had flown for about 36,000 hours.\nCrash.\nOn July 6, 2013, Flight 214 took off from Incheon International Airport (ICN) at 5:04\u00a0p.m. KST (08:04 UTC), which was 34 minutes late. It was supposed to land at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) at 11:04\u00a0a.m. PDT (18:04 UTC).\nOn July 6, 2013, at 11:26 PDT (18:26 UTC), the aircraft crashed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) when it was landing. It landed before the start of runway 28L, and it hit the seawall in San Francisco Bay. The pilots wanted to approach the runway at 137 knots, but the flight data recorder showed that the speed was below this, and that the engines were idle during the approach. When the plane crashed, both engines and the tail section were torn off the plane. People who saw the crash said there was a fireball when the aircraft crashed. There was a second, big explosion minutes after the crash. Evacuation slides were used to get the passengers off the plane. Even though the plane was damaged a lot, \"many [...] were able to walk away on their own\".\nThe Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 28L had been out of order since June 11. Therefore, the planes were landed by the pilot, without a lot of help from the autopilot; the clear weather made it easier to do this. Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who saved US Airways Flight 1549, said that investigators would think about whether the ILS being unavailable could have helped the crash happen.\nThis was only the third fatal crash in Asiana's history. It was also the first fatal airliner crash in the United States since the Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash in 2009.\nPassengers and crew.\nFour pilots were on board the plane. The pilots flying when the plane crashed were Lee Jeong-min, who has flown for 12,387 hours (3,220 with the 777) and Lee Kang-kook, who has flown for 9,793 hours, according to the South Korean transport ministry. Lee Kang-kook being trained to fly the 777, and this was his first landing at San Francisco in the aircraft. However, he had landed at San Francisco before in a Boeing 747. Lee Kang-kook only had 43 hours of experience with the 777 before the crash.\nChief of San Francisco Fire Department, Joanne Hayes-White, said that two people died. Both of them were Chinese and 16 years old. Both of their bodies were found outside the plane. Only one person was missing. Before this, it was thought that 60 people were missing. Later, Hayes-White said that everyone had been found.\nSeventy students and teachers going to the United States for summer camp were among the Chinese passengers. Thirty of the students and teachers were from Shanxi, and the others were from Zhejiang. Five of the teachers and 29 of the students were from Jiangshan High School in Zhejiang. They were traveling in one group. 35 of the students were going to a West Valley Christian School summer camp.\nOne teacher had small injuries, and the two passengers who died were supposed to be going to the West Valley camp.\nTestimony.\nSeveral passengers noticed how close the plane was to the Bay when it was coming in to land. This caused the water to jump up when the engines were powered up just before the crash.\nWhen the plane hit the ground, it was said that the oxygen masks dropped right away. After the aircraft stopped, some passengers said that there were sparks inside the cabin.\nJust after the crash, the pilots told the flight crew not to evacuate the passengers. However, the pilots later told them to evacuate, and the crew did so quickly. The crew also helped several passengers who could not escape the plane alone. One of the pilots carried out a passenger with an injured leg.\nOne flight attendant said that many of the Chinese passengers, at first, could not understand the instructions to evacuate because of a language barrier.\nDuring the evacuation, a fire began in the cabin, near the 10th row. One of the pilots put it out.\nTwo of the escape slides shot into the cabin instead of outside of it. The first escape slide blocked one of the exits and almost suffocated a flight attendant. One of the pilots burst it with an axe from the cockpit. The second went towards the middle of the aircraft, where there was a fire. It trapped another flight attendant, but a pilot burst it with a knife.\nSome passengers who were sitting at the back of the plane got out through the hole left by the tail of the plane, which was torn off in the crash.\nInvestigation.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has started an investigation. An NTSB team has been sent to San Francisco. Asiana CEO Yoon Young-Doo said \"Currently we understand that there were no engine or mechanical problems.\" It is thought that the plane was too low when it was coming in to land and hit the seawall. The NTSB said that it looked like the pilots were flying too slowly while approaching the runway. The sound of the stick shaker (when the yoke vibrates to warn pilots that the plane may stall) could be heard about 4 seconds before the crash on the cockpit voice recorder. The crew tried a go-around 1.5 seconds before the plane hit the ground and the engines seemed to have worked fine.\nOn July 7, 2013, NTSB investigators found the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. They were moved to Washington, D.C. to be analysed. The NTSB said that the pilots tried to stop the landing and go around 1.5 seconds before the crash.\nThe coroner of San Mateo County, Robert Foucrault, is doing an autopsy on the people who died. He and someone from the fire department have said that one of the girls who died might have survived the crash but might have been killed after being run over by a fire truck.\nAfter the crash.\nThis was the very first time that anyone died on a Boeing 777 aircraft.\nThe airport was closed for about five hours after the crash. Flights which were going to San Francisco were told to land somewhere else. Some of the other airports the planes landed at were Sacramento, Los Angeles and Seattle. By 3:30 PDT (22:30 UTC), runways 01L/19R and 01R/19L were open again. However, the runway the accident happened on 28L and the one next to it (28R) stayed closed. About 24 hours later, runway 10L/28R was opened again.\nAsiana is still flying from Seoul to San Francisco, but after the incident the flight number was changed to 212."}

The family owns a black maid, Flora (Melanie Nicholls-King). Mahree considers her a friend and does not understand that Flora is not happy with her life under apartheid. It is from Flora that Mahree hears about the weaver bird and its nest-building. This is used as a metaphor for racial harmony.

A chisel or knife are usual tools: the chisel can be tapped with a wooden mallet. The result is a wooden figure, or the sculptural ornamentation of a wooden object. A 'wood carving' may also refer to the finished product.\nThe making of sculpture in wood has a long history. Wood survives much less well than the other materials such as stone and bronze. It is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. Therefore, we do not know much about wood in the art history of older cultures. Outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed.\nMany of the most important sculptures of China and Japan are in wood, also most African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions. Wood is light, so it is suitable for masks and other objects meant to be carried. It can take very fine detail, and is also much easier to work than stone.\nSome of the finest examples of early European wood carving are from the Middle Ages in Germany, Russia, Italy and France, where the typical themes of that era were used in Christian icons. In England many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century, when oak was often used. In general, really fine carving is done in fruitwood (wood of a fruit tree) because that is easy to work with. The famous woodcarver Grinling Gibbons used to work with lime wood. Complex pieces are often carved in separate sections which are later stuck together."}

He was famous for his work in England, including St Paul's Cathedral, Blenheim Palace and Hampton Court Palace.\nGibons was born and educated in Holland of English parents, his father being a merchant.\nHe is widely regarded as the finest wood carver working in England, and the only one whose name is widely known among the general public. Most of his work is in lime (tilia) wood, especially decorative Baroque garlands made up of still-life elements at about life size. They are made to frame mirrors and decorate the walls of churches and palaces. He also produced furniture and small relief plaques with figurative scenes. He also worked in stone, mostly for churches. By the time he was established he led quite a large workshop.\nLife and work.\nVery little is known about his early life. About 1667 he moved to Deptford, now in London, and by 1693 had got commissions from the royal family. By 1680 he was known as the \"King's Carver\", and carried out exquisite work for St Paul's Cathedral and Windsor Castle. His carving was so fine that it was said a pot of carved flowers above his house in London would tremble from the motion of passing coaches.\nThe diarist John Evelyn first discovered Gibbons' talent by chance in 1671. Evelyn, from whom Gibbons rented a cottage near Evelyn's home in Deptford, wrote: \"I saw the young man at his carving, by the light of a candle. I saw him to be engaged on a carved representation of Tintoretto's \"Crucifixion\", which he had in a frame of his own making\". Later that same evening, Evelyn described what he had seen to Sir Christopher Wren. Wren and Evelyn then introduced him to King Charles II who gave him his first commission. It is still in the dining room of Windsor Castle.\nHorace Walpole later wrote about Gibbons: \"There is no instance of a man before Gibbons who gave wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers, and chained together the various productions of the elements with the free disorder natural to each species.\"\nGibbons is buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London.\nGibbons' work very often includes carvings of peapods. A myth states that he would include a closed pod in his work, only carving it open once he had been paid. If the pea pod was left shut it supposedly showed that he had not been paid for the work."}

In a Gram stain test, a counterstain, safranin, is added after the crystal violet. This colours all gram-negative bacteria with a red or pink colour.\nThis happens because an outer membrane stops the penetration of the stain. The test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their bacterial cell walls. Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet dye when washed in a decolourizing solution. Compared with gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria are more resistant against antibiotics, because of their relatively impermeable cell wall.\nThe lipopolysaccharide layer (LPS layer) is important. In humans, LPS triggers an innate immune response, with cytokine production and immune system activation. Inflammation is a common result of cytokine production."}

The characters are teenagers who discover that they are the heir of the throne of the fictional Kingdom of Genovia. Genovia is ruled by their grandmother Queen Dowager Clarisse Renaldi, played by Julie Andrews. It also stars Heather Matarazzo and James Franco as Mia and Peter's best friends Lilly Moscovitz and Harry, H\u00e9ctor Elizondo as Joseph, the Queen's Head of Security, and Robert Schwartzman as Lilly's brother Michael, who has a crush on Mia.\nThe movie was released in North American theaters on August 3, 2001. The movie peaked at number three in the box office. The movie was very successful. It grossed $165,335,153 worldwide. A sequel, \"The Princess Diaries 2\", was released in August 2004.\nPlot.\nShy high school student Mia Thermopolis resides with her single mother, Helen, in a refurbished firehouse in San Francisco. Unpopular among her peers, Mia suffers from a fear of public speaking while harboring a crush on Josh Bryant, and is often teased by his popular girlfriend Lana Thomas. Mia's only friends are social outcast Lilly Moscovitz, and Lilly's older brother Michael, who secretly harbors feelings for her. Mia learns from her estranged paternal grandmother, Clarisse, that she is the sole heir to the European kingdom of Genovia, having inherited the throne from her recently deceased father Philippe. Clarisse is determined to groom Mia into a refined princess so she may one day rule the kingdom over which Clarisse currently presides. Overwhelmed by the discovery, Mia initially refuses until Helen convinces her to attend her grandmother's \"princess lessons\" on the condition that she needs not make her final decision until the Genovian Independence Day Ball in three weeks' time.\nMia receives a glamorous makeover and a limousine chauffeured by Joe, the queen's head of security and confidante, who becomes a father figure to her. Mia's transformation causes her schoolmates to treat her differently, while her increasingly hectic schedule strains her relationship with Lilly. To appease her best friend, Mia tells Lilly the truth and swears her to secrecy. However, the public soon learns that Mia is a princess after the secret is sold to the press by Paolo, the hairdresser responsible for Mia's makeover, and the paparazzi begin to pursue her relentlessly. Although Mia embarrasses herself at her first state dinner, the queen admits that she found her clumsiness endearing and suggests that they spend quality time together. While bonding, Clarisse explains that although Mia's parents loved each other, they divorced amicably in order to pursue their own passions, Philippe remaining in Genovia to eventually become King, and Helen returning to America with Mia to offer her a \"normal\" childhood.\nAs Mia's popularity grows, Josh invites her to attend a beach party with him. Mia accepts, causing her to neglect Lilly and forego her plans with Michael. Josh kisses Mia in front of the paparazzi to bolster his own fame, while Lana helps the paparazzi photograph Mia wearing only a towel; both photographs are printed in the newspaper the following day. Finding the photos inappropriate for a princess, Clarisse admonishes Mia for her behavior, after which a humiliated Mia promises to renounce her title. Joe reminds Clarisse that Mia is still a teenager and her granddaughter, suggesting that the queen reacted too harshly.\nAfter making amends with Lilly, Mia finally stands up to Lana for bullying a schoolmate. Mia invites Lilly and Michael to the ball but Michael declines, still heartbroken over Mia's initial dismissal. After Clarisse apologises to Mia for scolding her, she states that Mia must publicly renounce the throne at the ball. Terrified by the prospect, Mia plans to run away until she discovers a touching letter from her late father and relents. Mia's car malfunctions while driving to the ball, stranding her in a downpour until she is retrieved by Joe.\nWhen she finally arrives, Mia, still wet and untidy from the rain, delivers a compelling speech and accepts her role as Princess of Genovia. After changing into a gown, Mia accompanies Clarisse into the ballroom where Michael, who has accepted Mia's apology, invites her to dance before confessing their feelings for each other and sharing their first kiss. In the final scene, Mia is shown travelling to Genovia in a private plane with her pet cat Fat Louie, and she writes in her diary that she plans to relocate to Genovia with their mother."}

He played right field for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 through 1972. Clemente's career was cut short by his death in a plane crash off the coast of his homeland of Puerto Rico. The flight was planned to deliver emergency supplies to victims of an earthquake in Nicaragua.\nEarly life.\nClemente was the first Latin American elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He and Lou Gehrig are the only Hall of Fame members that did not have the five-year waiting period. However, the rules for election were different in Gehrig's day. \nCareer.\nHe was eligible when he retired in 1939, and the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), which then as now is the main body for electing players, chose to hold a special election specifically to elect him. (This was probably because Gehrig was known to be dying, and the voters wanted to elect him while he was still alive.) \nAfter Clemente's death, the BBWAA made an exception to its five-year waiting period for Clemente. The exception made for Clemente is now a rule\u2014a player who dies while active, or within five years of his retirement, becomes eligible for election six months after his death (provided he has played at least 10 years in Major League Baseball). \nClemente did a lot of charity work, especially in Latin American countries; as noted above, he died on a charity mission to Latin America. Each year the MLB gives the Roberto Clemente Award. This award is for the player who best follows Clemente's example with charity work. \nIn 1973, Clemente was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and the first Presidential Citizens Medal. On August 17, 1984 the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp honoring Clemente. This was the day before what would have been his 50th birthday.\nPersonal life.\nOn November 14, 1964, Clemente married Vera Zabala at San Fernando Church in Carolina. The couple had three children:\u00a0Roberto, Jr., born in 1965, Luis Roberto, born in 1966, and Enrique Roberto, born in 1969. His Major League Debut Was In Pittsburgh Pirates"}

Their teeth are longer than a modern tiger, but shorter than \"Smilodon\". Therefore, they are sometimes called \"scimitar-toothed cats\".\n\"Homotherium\" was widespread in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (5 million years ago \u2013 10,000 years ago).\nIt first became extinct in Africa some 1.5 million years ago. In Eurasia it survived until about 30,000 years ago. In South America it is only known from a few remains in the northern (Venezuela), in the mid-Pleistocene. The last scimitar cat could have survived in North America until 10,000 years ago.\nPalaeobiology.\nWhat we have of evidence comes from the skeletons. From its teeth, its killing method would have been somewhat different from \"Smilodon\". The canines look like they were used for a stabbing action rather than slashing. The build of the body is much stronger at the front and heavier than modern cats, which suggests an ambush strategy. That in turn suggests cover in woodlands, which were very common in the Pliocene and much of the Pleistocene.\nThe skull has noteworthy features. The incisors at the front were proportionately much bigger than modern cats, and stood proud in front of the canines. They must have played a role in holding and pulling the prey. The meat-slicing molars at the back were huge. The legs were fairly long, with the front legs longer than the hind legs. The short tail and short lumbar region of the spine completes the picture of a very strong animal, capable of wrestling with large prey. A reasonable summary is that \"Homotherium\" had features combinbing those of hyaenas and modern big cats. It was capable of ambush hunting, but also long-distance chases at moderate speeds. It would operate in open woodland.\nPossibly all these sabretooths operated by jumping onto the prey's neck, hanging on with their strong front limbs, and digging into the prey's neck with their teeth. Their canines could penetrate the hide of large mammals, unlike modern lions, which have to suffocate their prey.\n\"Homotherium\" skeletons have been found in association with those of mammoths, mastodons and rhinoceros. The implication is that juvenile elephants might have been on their menu."}

It is based on a fairy tale by Madame Leprince de Beaumont, and the 1991 Disney animated movie, \"Beauty and the Beast\".\nThe book was written by Linda Woolverton. The lyrics were written by Howard Ashman and Tim Rice. The music was written by Alan Menken. The musical opened on Broadway in 1994, and in the West End in 1997.\nPlot.\nAct I.\nOn a cold winter night, an old beggar woman comes to a young spoiled prince's castle, offering him a single rose in return for shelter from the cold. But the prince turns her away solely for her appearance. The old woman warns him not to be fooled by appearances, as true beauty lies within, only to be rejected again. She then transforms into a beautiful enchantress and turns the prince into a hideous\u00a0Beast\u00a0and his servants into various household objects. She gives him the rose to use as an hour-glass. The only way he can break the spell is to learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal falls (\"Prologue\").\n10 years later, a beautiful young girl named\u00a0Belle\u00a0makes her way into town one morning in order to get a book from the local book seller. On the way she expresses her wish to live in a world like her books, full of adventure, while the townspeople note her unparalleled beauty but find her love of books odd (\"Belle\"). Belle has also attracted the attentions of\u00a0Gaston\u00a0(the local hunter and town hero) who admires her only for her beauty and not her intelligence.\nBelle, however, is not oblivious to her peers' views of her. She voices her concerns about it to her eccentric father and inventor, Maurice who assures her that she is anything but strange (\"No Matter What\"). The two then put the finishing touches on his invention and Maurice heads off to an invention fair donning a scarf knitted for him by Belle (\"No Matter What (Reprise)\"). After surviving a wolf attack, he enters the Beast's castle where the servants, including Lumi\u00e8re, a ma\u00eetre d' turned into a\u00a0candelabra, Cogsworth, the head of household turned into a clock, Babette, a maid turned into a feather duster that still seems to retain her flirtatious tendencies, Mrs. Potts, the head of the kitchen turned into a tea pot, and Chip, her son turned into a teacup. They welcome him, but the horrid Beast arrives and locks Maurice away in the dungeon for trespassing.\nBack in town, Gaston proposes to Belle, which she politely rejects (\"Me\"). Appalled by Gaston's forwardness, Belle once again voices her need for a life outside this provincial life (\"Belle (Reprise)\"). Gaston's sidekick, LeFou, returns from the woods wearing the scarf Belle knitted for Maurice. Belle realizes her father is in danger and heads into the woods to look for him. She ends up at the castle where she finds her father locked away in a dungeon. She makes a deal with the Beast, Maurice goes free but she remains instead. They agree and Maurice is sent back to town without being allowed to say goodbye. Belle is given a guest room and ordered by the Beast to join him for dinner. She mourns her situation (\"Home\"), but Mrs. Potts and Madame de la Grande Bouche, an operatic wardrobe, attempt to cheer her up (\"Home (Reprise)\").\nBack in town, at the local tavern, Gaston sulks at his loss of a bride. LeFou and the patrons attempt to cheer him up (\"Gaston\"), when Maurice rushes in claiming a Beast has Belle locked away, they laugh at him but Gaston formulates a plan (\"Gaston (Reprise)\"). Back at the castle, the Beast grows impatient as Belle has yet to join him for dinner. Cogsworth informs him she refuses to come, after a shouting match between Belle and the Beast (which ends in a victory for Belle) he tells her if she cannot eat with him then she will not eat at all. In his quarters, he sulks and notes his fate should the spell not break (\"How Long Must This Go On?\"). Eventually Belle does become hungry and ventures into the kitchen where the servants offer her dinner despite their master's orders. They treat her to an amazing cabaret show (\"Be Our Guest\").\nAfter dinner, Belle gets a tour of the castle courtesy of Cogsworth and Lumi\u00e8re, her curiosity leads her to enter the West Wing, a place the Beast told her was forbidden. Mesmerized by a mysterious rose floating in a bell jar, she reaches out to touch it but before she can, the Beast stops her and orders her to get out accidentally shoving her in the process. Fearing for her life, Belle flees from the castle. Realizing his deadly mistake, the Beast knows he will be a monster forever if he cannot learn to love her (\"If I Can't Love Her\").\nAct II.\nIn the woods, Belle is attacked by wolves and is only rescued when the Beast comes to her aid, but he is injured during the fight and collapses (\"Entr'acte/Wolf Chase\"). Instead of taking the chance to run home Belle helps him back to the castle. She cleans his injuries and after a brief argument about whose fault this is, the Beast thanks her for her kindness and thus their friendship is born. Wanting to give her a thank-you gift, the Beast gives Belle his huge library, which excites her. She notes a change in the Beast's personality as the servants note a change in Belle and the Beast's relationship (\"Something There\"). They express their hope of being human once more (\"Human Again\") while Belle asks the Beast to accompany her to dinner that night.\nBack in the village, Gaston meets with the asylum owner Monsieur D'Arque. They plan to lock Maurice away to blackmail Belle into marrying Gaston (\"Maison des Lunes\"). In the castle, the Beast and Belle attend a lovely dinner and personal ball, where they dance together in the ballroom (\"Beauty and the Beast\"). After, the Beast (who plans to tell Belle he loves her) asks her if she is happy here, she responds positively but notes that she misses her father. He offers her his Magic Mirror to view him. She sees that Maurice is sick and lost in the woods and fears for his life. Even though The Beast knows there is only a few hours left till the last petal falls from the rose, he allows Belle to leave in order to save her father; she departs after a tearful goodbye (\"If I Can't Love Her (Reprise)\").\nBelle finds her father and brings him back to their house in the village. After she is able to nurse him back to health, she explains the transformation she seems to have gone through while she was with the Beast (\"A Change in Me\"). A mob arrives, led by Gaston to take Maurice to the asylum. Belle proves her father's sanity by showing the townspeople the Beast is real using the Magic Mirror, but doesn't realize the error in her gesture. The townspeople immediately fear the Beast, but Belle insists he's gentle and kind. Gaston catches her tone and recognizes the Beast as his rival for Belle's affections and organizes the mob to kill the Beast (\"Mob Song\"). In order to warn the Beast, Belle and Maurice decide to beat the mob to the castle. However, Gaston and the mob had already reached the castle before Belle and Maurice did.\nAt the castle, the servants are able to keep the lynch mob at bay but Gaston breaks through and finds the Beast in his tower. He engages in a fight with him, mercilessly beating and taunting him (\"Battle\"). The Beast has lost the will to live at Belle's departure. As Gaston moves in for the killing blow, Belle arrives. The Beast immediately turns on Gaston and is prepared to kill him, but spares his life after seeing the fear in his eyes. The Beast and Belle are reunited, but this reunion is cut short as Gaston plunges his dagger into the Beast's back. This act of violence causes Gaston to lose his footing and he falls to his death.\nOn the balcony, Belle assures the Beast he will live but they both know she is helpless to save him. She begs him not to leave her because she has found home in his company (\"End Duet\"), but despite this, he dies; Belle sobs on his body and says she loves him just before the last rose petal falls. A transformation takes place (\"Transformation\") and the Beast is alive and human once more. Though Belle does not recognize him at first, she looks into his eyes and sees the Beast within and they kiss. The two sing of how their lives have changed because of love and they dance once more as the company, now changed back to their human form, gathers in the ballroom (\"Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)\")."}

Each type of zooid depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.\nThis kind of set-up is also found in the siphonophores: the Portuguese man o' war. They evolved independently, and are classified in different orders.\nFossil record.\nA rare soft-bodied fossil was got from Mississippian strata in northeastern Kentucky.

They happen regularly in planetary systems, such as our Solar System. They most often involve small objects, such as asteroids, comets or meteors. These have relatively little impact. When a large object collides with a planet like the Earth, it can have serious effects on the planet. We try to find out when one is going to hit Earth using impact prediction. Depending on the size of the object, much of the impact is reduced by the planet's atmosphere. Smaller objects explode or break apart as they enter the atmosphere. These are seen as bolides.\nImpact craters, which are caused by impact events, can be seen on many of the planets and other objects in the Solar System. Some of the largest are on Mars and the Moon. These are said to be evidence of major impact events. The first time an impact event was recorded was in July 1994. A comet, Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9, broke apart and collided with Jupiter. The collision was recorded by telescopes and satellites.\nImpact events appear to have had a major effect on the how the Solar System has changed since it was formed. Major impact events have also shaped the history of the Earth, including the evolution of life. It is thought that the Chicxulub impact, which happened 66 million years ago, caused the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. There is debate over whether impacts caused any of the other extinction events throughout history. A giant impact event is thought to have produced the Moon.\nHundreds of impacts have been reported on Earth. Many happen without being seen by anyone on the ground. On average, asteroids with a diameter of impact Earth about once per year. These usually explode in the upper atmosphere, and most or all of the solids are vaporised. Asteroids with a diameter of collide with Earth every 500,000 years. Large collisions, of , happen once every twenty million years. Some much smaller asteroids have caused damage and injuries, but no human is known to have been killed directly by an impact. The Chelyabinsk meteor event in 2013 is the only impact event known to have resulted in a large number of injuries. It was about 20 metres wide. One of the most well-known impacts in modern times was the Tunguska event. This happened in Siberia in 1908. Impacts of that size are said to happen about once every thousand years."}

He wrote many musicals with Oscar Hammerstein II, including \"Oklahoma!\", \"Carousel\", \"South Pacific\", \"The King and I\", the television musical, \"Cinderella\", and \"The Sound of Music\".\nRodgers was the first person to win all four top show business awards: an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. He also won a Pulitzer Prize.\nLife.\nRodgers was born in New York City to Dr. William Rodgers and his wife, Mamie, who were of German Jewish descent. The family enjoyed musicals and opera. At 15, Rodgers chose music as his profession. He attended Columbia University, and wrote for the school's \"Varsity Show\".\nRodgers, Lorenz Hart, and Oscar Hammerstein II all attended Columbia University. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers changed his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now Juilliard). Rodgers was influenced by composers such as Victor Herbert and Jerome Kern.\nLate in life, Rodgers established scholarships and other awards for students of The Juilliard School of Music, the American Theater Wing and the American Academy of Dramatic Art.\nLorenz Hart.\nIn 1919 Rodgers met Lorenz Hart. The two wrote 26 musicals together, and song standards such as \"I'll Take Manhattan\", \"My Funny Valentine\", and \"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\".\nTheir first professional production was the 1920 \"Poor Little Ritz Girl\". In 1925 they became well known for the song \"Manhattan\". The duo then wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London. Because of the Depression in the 1930s, they went to work in Hollywood. In 1935, they returned to Broadway. They wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows. This ended with Hart's death in 1943.\nOscar Hammerstein II.\nIn 1942, Rodgers teamed up with Oscar Hammerstein II. They made the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their first musical was the hit \"Oklahoma!\". The team went on to create four more of the most popular musicals to date: \"Carousel\" (1945), \"South Pacific\", \"The King and I\" (1951), and \"The Sound of Music\" (1959). All four were made into popular films.\nRodgers and Hammerstein musicals earned a total of 35 Tony Awards, 15 Academy Awards, two Pulitzer Prizes, two Grammy Awards, and two Emmy Awards.\nRodgers, Hammerstein, and Joshua Logan won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for \"South Pacific\". Rodgers and Hammerstein also won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for \"Oklahoma!\".\nAfter Hammerstein's death in 1960, Rodgers wrote both words and music for his first new Broadway project. Rodgers went on to work with lyricists Stephen Sondheim and Sheldon Harnick.\nPersonal.\nRodgers married Dorothy Feiner in 1930. They had two daughters, Mary and Linda.

Beforehand, such cards used a magnetic stripe to store information. This approach has two main problems: first, the amount of data that can be stored is relatively small. Such a card can store about 1024 Bits, or 128 bytes. The second problem is bigger: the data stored is not encrypted. Using a card with EMV technology, also called a \"chip card\" for the shiny, metallic \"chip\" on the front, can solve both problems: it can store much more data, and the data can be encrypted.\nPayment cards that use chips have been in use since the early 1990s. Beforehand, each card issuer had their own protocol. With EMV, the protocol has been standardised. The first version of EMV was published in 1995, and there have been different versions since then. It was adopted in Europe before the United States, which required all new cards from 2015 on to have EMV chips.\nHow do EMV cards work?\nPayments using EMV technology is often called \"chip and PIN\". This is because to use such a card to make a payment at a cash register or point-of-sale terminal, the card first needs to be inserted into a small machine called a \"payment terminal\" or \"PIN pad\", with the side where the chip is on facing up and towards the machine. Once the card is inserted, it is left there so that the terminal can read the data stored in the chip. The terminal will often ask the user to confirm the amount of the purchase or refund, choose the account in the case of a debit card, and will then require the user to enter a personal identification number (PIN). This number makes sure nobody other than the owner of the card can use it - if the wrong PIN is entered a certain number of times, the card is locked and cannot be used. Once the correct PIN is entered, the terminal will contact the bank to authorize the transaction. The bank will either \"approve\" (accept) the transaction, or \"decline\" (reject) it. Once this happens, the person removes his or her card from the terminal."}

They are sometimes called volcanic necks or \"puys\". The plug is revealed when surrounding land is eroded.\nAs it forms, a plug may cause an extreme build-up of pressure if gas-charged magma is trapped beneath it. This sometimes leads to an explosive eruption. But if the explosion does not occur, then the volcano becomes a solid block made of hard material.\nThe plug is usually harder than the surrounding rock. Glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side, while a long slope of material remains on the lee side. Such landforms are called crag and tail. If a plug is preserved, erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains. This is what produces the distinctive upstanding landform."}

The word is French for \"shop\".\n\"Boutique\" was an everyday English word in the late 1960s when, for a brief period, Swinging London was the centre of the fashion trade. Carnaby Street and the Kings Road were the focus of much media attention as the most fashionable boutiques of the era were there.\nToday, boutique may refer to a specialised firm, such as a boutique investment bank or boutique law firm. The word is often used to describe small private hotels, to distinguish them from larger chains (such as Hilton Hotels). In such cases the term suggest their operation is elite and highly specialised.\nIn the strictest sense of the word, boutiques would be one-of-a-kind but some chains are referred to as boutiques if they specialize in particular styles.\nRecently, the term \"boutique\" has started being applied to normally-mass-market items that are either niche or produced in intentionally small numbers at very high prices. This may be referred to as boutique manufacturing. For example, a \"Time Magazine\" article suggested that Nintendo could become a \"boutique video-game company\", producing games for niche audiences, rather than trying to compete directly with Microsoft and Sony."}

He lived and worked in England. He was the first book publisher to print lots of books for children such as \"A Little Pretty Pocket Book\" and \"The History Of Little Goody Two-Shoes\". The Newbery Medal is named after him. He also published books for grown-ups. Some of the writers for grown-ups whose books he printed were Christopher Smart, Oliver Goldsmith, and Samuel Johnson.\nHis early life.\nJohn Newbery was born in 1713. His father was Robert Newbery, a farmer who lived in Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire, England. John Newbery did not go to school. He taught himself.\nWhen he was sixteen years old, John Newbery went to live with a printer named William Ayers. He was William Ayers's apprentice. William Ayers taught John Newbery how to be a printer. After some time, William Ayers sold his printing shop to William Carnan. William Carnan also taught John Newbery how to be a printer. In 1737 William Carnan died. When he died, he gave the printing shop to his brother Charles Carnan and also to John Newbery. They shared the shop and worked together.\nTwo years after William Carnan died, John Newbery married a woman named Jordan Mary. Jordan Mary was William Carnan's wife before William died. Jordan Mary and William Carnan had three children before William Carnan died. Their names were John, Thomas, and Anna-Maria. When John Newbery married Jordan Mary, he adopted her three children to be his own children. John Newbery and Jordan Mary had three new children. Their names were Mary, John, and Francis. Mary was born in 1740. John was born in 1741. He died when he was 11 years old. Francis was born in 1743.\nHis work as a printer.\nIn 1740, John Newbery worked as a printer in Reading, England. One of the first books he printed was called \"The Whole Duty of Man\". It was written by Richard Allestree. In 1743, John Newbery went to London to work as a printer there. He gave his printing shop in Reading to John Carnan. John Carnan was the oldest son of Jordan Mary and William Carnan.\nJohn Newbery's first printing shop in London was at the Bible and Crown near Devereux Court. First he printed books for grown-ups. Soon he started to print books for children. The first children's book he printed was called \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\". He started printing it on July 18, 1744. It cost six pence, or English pennies. A person who bought \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\" from John Newbery could also buy a red and black toy ball from him for two more pennies. The toy ball was made of cloth and stuffed with sawdust. Children who read the book could stick pins into the ball. They stuck a pin into the red side of the ball when they were good at reading the selection. They stuck a pin into the black side of the ball when they were bad at it. This made them think about whether they were being good or bad. John Newbery thought this game with the ball would encourage the children to be more fluent when reading.\nMany people liked \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\". It had a bright colored cover. It was small enough for children to carry in their pockets. It had poems and wise sayings and an alphabet song printed in it. John Newbery sold a lot of copies of \"A Little Pretty Pocket Book\". He printed more books for children. He sold more children's books than any other book printer who sold children's books at that time.\nIn 1745, John Newbery got a better printing shop. This shop was at 65 St. Paul's Churchyard. John Newbery called it the Bible and Sun. He printed books for children and grown-ups at this shop. He made so much money at this shop that he sold his old printing shop in Reading. He also made so much money that he sent his youngest son, Francis, to Oxford and to Cambridge to study there.\nJohn Newbery printed about five hundred different books in his life. He printed about one hundred different books for children. He printed ABC books, story books, and magazines for children. He printed some books that he wrote. He also printed books that other people wrote. His most popular book was called \"The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes\". It told about a little girl who was always good.\nJohn Newbery did not just sell books. He sold many things. One thing he sold was a patent medicine. It may not have been a good medicine, but John Newbery wrote about it in the books that he sold, and so people knew its name and bought it when they were sick.\nWhen he was old, John Newbery was very rich. He used his money to help writers who did not have enough money to live on. Two of the writers that he helped were Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith. Both of these writers wrote stories about how good John Newbery was.\nJohn Newbery died on December 22, 1767, in Islington. He is buried in Waltham St Lawrence, the same town where he was born."}

He was born Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He moved to the United States in 1902.\nLife.\n He was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. His father was also named Hendrik Willem van Loon. His mother was named Elisabeth Johanna Hankin. In 1902, he went to the United States to study at Cornell University. He graduated from Cornell in 1905. In 1906 he married Eliza Ingersoll Bowditch. Her father was a teacher at Harvard. They had two sons, Henry Bowditch van Loon and Gerard Willem van Loon. After they got married, Hendrik and Eliza moved to Munich, Germany. Hendrik studied at the University of Munich. In 1911 he got his Ph.D. He had to write a long paper to show that he was a good enough student to get the Ph.D. The paper he wrote was called \"The Fall of the Dutch Republic\". In 1913 he published it as a book. During the Russian Revolution of 1905 and again at the start of World War I he worked for the Associated Press. He went to the places where soldiers were fighting each other and wrote about what the battles were like. From 1915 to 1917 he taught at Cornell University. In 1919 he was made a citizen of the United States. In 1920 he married Eliza Helen (Jimmie) Criswell. In 1927 he married Frances Goodrich Ames, a woman who wrote plays. Later he stopped being married to Frances Ames. He went back to Eliza Criswell. No one knows if they got married again. When he died in 1944, he gave his things to Eliza Criswell.\nWriting.\nHendrik Willem van Loon wrote lots of books. His most well-known book is \"The Story of Mankind\". He wrote it and also drew many pictures and maps for it. It is a history of the world written for children. \"The Story of Mankind\" won the first Newbery Medal in 1922. People have read \"The Story of Mankind\" ever since it was first printed. Hendrik's son Gerard wrote more chapters for the book after more history had happened. Later, other people wrote even more chapters. The book now has about 500 pages. Hendrik also wrote lots of other books for children and young adults.\nHendrik Willem van Loon visited Germany lots of times in the 1920s. In 1933, when the Nazis ruled Germany, they told him he could not visit Germany any more. In 1938, Hendrik wrote a book that he called \"Our Battle: Being One Man's Answer to \"My Battle\" by Adolf Hitler\". This book said why Hendrik did not like Adolf Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\". (\"Mein Kampf\" means \"My Battle\" in the German language.) Franklin Delano Roosevelt liked Hendrik's book \"Our Battle\" very much. In 1940, Hendrik helped Roosevelt try to get to be President of the United States.\nThings said by Van Loon.\nSomeone once asked Hendrik Willem van Loon how to say his last name. He answered, \"I still stick to the Dutch pronunciation of the double \"o\"\u2014\"Loon\" like \"loan\" in 'Loan and Trust Co.' My sons will probably accept the American pronunciation. It really does not matter very much.\"\nBooks written by Van Loon.\n These are the books that Hendrik Willem van Loon wrote. The dates show the first time each book was printed. The other names tell what publisher printed them.\nIn popular culture.\nFrancesco Guccini, a man from Italy who writes songs, wrote a song called \"Van Loon\". Guccini's father loved Hendrik Willem Van Loon's books. The song is on Guccini's music album called \"Signora Bovary\"."}

It is one of the many members of the family Malacanthidae. It is the only species within the genus \"Malacanthus\".\nDescription.\nFish from the family Malacanthidae have streamlined bodies and large crests on their head. They have relatively long dorsal fins and anal fins. The blue blanquillo gets its name from its mainly blue colour. It also has some shades of yellow, and can change colour in different situations. On their backs, there is a set of stripes that run across its body. Their belly is white. The colour of the head changes from a light blue to a pinkish mix during spawning season.\nWhere they live.\nBlue blanquillo fish are usually found in the Indo-Pacific area. They live anywhere from the Red Sea to the Line Islands, north to southern Japan and south to New Caledonia and the Cook Islands. They are often seen in areas around coral reefs near the sea floor.\nBehaviour.\n\"Malacanthus latovittatus\" does not swim in groups. They are often found swimming alone or two together. They are known to clean other fish. They also mimic the wrasse to stop predators from eating it.\nThe fish can swim at depths of . The temperatures of the water it swims in normally range from . They tend to swim high above the floor of the sea. This is so that they can pick prey from the ground with their eyesight, which is very good.\nEcology.\nThe blue blanquillo's main staple are the invertebrates or zooplankton that live near the bottom of the sea. They also eat crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp, molluscs, worms, sea urchins and small fish. Their common predators are reef sharks, and other larger fish. They are also eaten by humans."}

He wrote poetry, long made-up stories, plays, true stories about the lives of people who made big changes in the world, and stories for children. He also wrote down stories other people told, if the stories were so old that nobody knew who told them the very first time. He was one of the Irish writers who were part of the Irish Literary Revival. This was a time when many very good Irish writers all wrote lots of stories and poems that were full of big important thoughts. It happened near the end of the 19th century and near the start of the 20th century.\nEarly life.\nPadraic Colum was born in County Longford, Ireland. When he was born, his name was Patrick Collumb. He changed it later. He was born in a place where poor people could live if they did not have homes of their own. He was born there because his father worked there. His father's name was also Patrick Collumb. His mother's name was Susan Collumb. Patrick and Susan Collumb had seven more children after they had Padraic Colum.\nIn 1889, Patrick Collumb lost his job at the place where poor people could live. He left Ireland. He did not take Susan and Padraic and his other children with him. He went to Pike's Peak, a mountain which is in Colorado in the United States. He looked for gold there. Lots of other people also went to Pike's Peak to look for gold. Patrick Collumb did not find much gold. In 1892, he came back to Ireland. He got a job at a place where trains stopped. This job was at Glasthule, Ireland, which is near Dublin. Padraic went to school in Dublin. In 1897, Susan Collumb died. Most of the family left Dublin. They moved back to Longford. Padraic did not go to Longford. He kept going to school in Dublin. One of his brothers also went to school in Dublin.\nWhen Padraic Colum was seventeen years old, he finished going to school. He got a job writing down where many trains went and what they carried to each place. He worked at this job until 1903. While Padraic worked at this job, he also started to write stories. Padraic read a lot of books about Ireland at the National Library of Ireland. Padraic made friends with a writer called James Joyce at the library. Padraic Colum and James Joyce were always friends after that. Padraic was also friends with a man called Herbert Hughes. Herbert studied music. Herbert and Padraic talked to a lot of people who knew old folk songs that people in Ireland had sung for many years. Herbert and Padraic wrote down the songs. Herbert wrote down the music and Padraic wrote down the words. Some of the songs were in the Irish language, so Padraic wrote English words for them. He did this so that more people would sing them. An American man named Thomas Kelly gave Padraic money to go to school some more. Padraic went to school for five years at University College Dublin with this money.\nAt that time, most Irish people could not speak the Irish language. Padraic joined a group of people who wanted more Irish people to learn how to speak the Irish language. They called themselves the Gaelic League, because the name of the Irish language is \"Gaelic\".\nEarly poetry and plays.\nPadraic wrote his first play in 1903. He called it \"Broken Soil\". Later he changed some of the words in the play. He called the changed play \"The Fiddler's House\". A group of actors who called themselves W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company acted out this play. In 1905 Padraic wrote a play called \"The Land\". The same group of actors acted out that play. Many people said that the actors and the play were very good. Later, these actors were part of the Abbey Theatre. This was a place where Irish people who wrote plays could have their plays acted out. At that time, many people did not think that Irish people could write very well. The Abbey Theatre helped to show these people that Irish people could write good plays. Padraic helped to run the Abbey Theatre.\nPadraic wrote a play called \"The Saxon Shillin\"'. This play said that Irish people should not fight in the English army. At the time Padraic wrote the play, England ruled Ireland, and Padraic did not like that. The Gaelic League gave Padraic a prize because they liked that play. Padraic also wrote other plays. The Abbey Theatre showed some of Padraic's plays. One of those plays was called \"Thomas Muskerry\". Padraic wrote it in 1910.\nPadraic had a friend called Arthur Griffith. Arthur Griffith was the leader of Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein was a political group. The people in Sinn Fein did not want England to rule Ireland any more. Arthur Griffith printed a newspaper that said why he thought England should not rule Ireland. This newspaper was called \"The United Irishman\". Padraic wrote poems that Arthur Griffith printed in his newspaper. One of Padraic's poems was called \"The Poor Scholar\". William Butler Yeats liked this poem very much. Yeats was an Irish writer. Many people said he was the best Irish writer who was alive at that time. William Butler Yeats was friends with Padraic Colum. Padraic also met Lady Gregory, who was another Irish writer that many people liked. In 1907, the Abbey Theatre showed a play called \"The Playboy of the Western World\". Padraic Colum and Arthur Griffith and some other people thought this play said bad things about Irish people. They did not want the play to be shown. They got very angry and started a riot. After the riot, Padraic Colum and W.B. Yeats were not friends any more.\nIn 1908, a publisher called J.M. Dent and Company started to print new copies of good books that they thought everybody should read. One of the books that they printed was written by Edgar Allan Poe. It was called \"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\". Padraic Colum got to write about why Edgar Allan Poe was a good writer and why everybody should read Poe's stories. This introduction that Padraic wrote was printed in the front of the new books.\nIn 1911, Padraic started to print a newspaper. He called his newspaper \"The Irish Review\". Three of his friends helped him run the newspaper. These friends were called Mary Gunning Maguire, David Houston, and Thomas MacDonagh. Padraic had met Mary Gunning Maguire at college. The newspaper printed things that were written by many very good Irish writers. Some of these writers were W.B. Yeats, George Moore, and Oliver St John Gogarty.\nIn 1912, Padraic Colum and Mary Gunning Maguire got married. Mary worked at a school which Padraig Pearse started. Padraig Pearse was a member of the Gaelic League. He was a friend of Padraic and Mary. Padraig Pearse's school was called Scoil \u00c9anna. It was in Rathfarnam, County Dublin. Padraic and Mary lived in Donnybrook. Donnybrook is part of Dublin. Every Tuesday, Padraic and Mary asked lots of good writers to come to their house and talk to each other about writing. Later, Padraic and Mary moved to Howth. Howth was a very small town or village near Dublin. Most of the people who lived in Howth worked at catching fish. In 1914, Padraic and Mary moved to the United States of America. They thought they would stay for two or three months. They stayed in the United States for eight years.\nLater life and work.\nWhile he was living in America, Padraic Colum started writing books for children. First he took an old story that was written in the Irish language and put it into English words. He did this because he did not want to forget the Irish language. He had this story published in the \"New York Tribune\". A man named Willy P\u00f3gany read the story and told Padraic he should make it into a long book. Willy P\u00f3gany was born in Hungary. His job was drawing pictures. Willy P\u00f3gany told Padraic that if Padraic wrote a book, Willy P\u00f3gany would draw the pictures. Padraic wrote the book, and Willy drew the pictures. The book was called \"The King of Ireland's Son\". It was published in 1916.\nPadraic wrote more books for children. The Macmillan Publishing Company told him that if he would write books for them to print, they would pay him lots of money. Then Padraic would always have enough money to live on. Padraic said yes. Three of the books Padraic wrote for children were made Newbery Medal Honor Books. That meant that some people who had studied children's books thought that those were very good books for children to read. Those three books were called \"The Golden Fleece and the Heroes Who Lived Before Achilles\", ', and '. \"The Golden Fleece...\" was first printed in 1921, and was made a Newbery Honor Book in 1922. \"The Voyagers\" was first printed in 1925, and was made a Newbery Honor Book in 1926. \"The Big Tree of Bunlahy\" was first printed in 1933, and was made a Newbery Honor Book in 1934.\nMany of the books that Padraic wrote for children were stories that other people had told before. Padraic put the stories into English words. These stories came from many places. Padraic used stories that came from Ireland, Greece, Norway, and even Hawaii. Padraic wrote three books of stories from Hawaii. Much later, on May 23, 2011, Barack Obama, who was the President of the United States, visited Ireland. The Prime Minister of Ireland, whose name was Enda Kenny, gave him copies of those three books. The copies that Enda Kenny gave to Barack Obama were some of the first copies of those books that had ever been printed.\nPadraic Colum also wrote long books for grown-up people. Two of those books are called \"Castle Conquer\" and \"The Flying Swans\". From 1930 to 1933, Padraic and Mary Colum lived in France. Padraic's good friend James Joyce also lived in France at that time. Padraic and James liked visiting each other in France. Padraic helped James to write down some parts of James's big book that he called \"Finnegans Wake\". In 1933, Padraic and Mary moved to New York City. They taught some lessons at Columbia University and at the City College of New York. Padraic wrote 61 books in his life. He also wrote many plays. He wrote some of his plays in ways that made them sound like Noh plays. Noh plays are a special kind of play. Noh plays were first shown in Japan.\nMary and Padraic Colum started writing a book that they called \"Our Friend James Joyce\". In 1957, before the book was done, Mary Colum died. Padraic finished the book by himself. It was published in 1958. When he was an old man, Padraic did not live in one place. He lived in the United States for part of the time and in Ireland for part of the time. In 1961 he got a Regina Medal from the Catholic Library Association. This medal meant that Padraic had written a lot of books for children. It also meant that the people who gave him the medal liked Padraic's books. Padraic Colum died in Enfield, Connecticut, when he was 90 years old. He was buried in Ireland, in St Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton. Sutton is a part of Dublin.\nThings that Padraic Colum said.\nSomeone once asked Padraic Colum how to say his name. He said, \"In my first name, the first \"a\" has the sound of \"au\".\" His first name should be said \"pau'drig\". He said that his last name is just like the English word \"column\"."}

It is being called the \"longest season to date\" in \"Big Brother\" history, lasting a total of 90 days. This season features sixteen HouseGuests. \nThe show's format remained the same from previous seasons of the show. A group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests\", compete to win the series by voting each other off. They must be the last HouseGuest remaining. Each week, one HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block. The Head of Household must nominate another HouseGuest as a replacement. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of them, the nominee with the most votes are removed from the show. When only two HouseGuests remain, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be \"expelled\" from the show for not following rules.\nThere have been several controversial remarks from some of the \"Big Brother 15\" HouseGuests. Their comments have angered viewers and because of this, the show's ratings have dropped. Many journalist have made negative reviews about the HouseGuests who made these remarks. HouseGuest including Aaryn Gries, GinaMarie Zimmerman and Spencer Clawson have made racist comments about two African American contestants on the show. Spencer made negative comments about a gay contestant calling him \"Kermit the Fag\". Aaryn and GinaMarie also made negative comments about Asian contestant Helen. Aaryn and GinaMarie were fired from their jobs because of their comments. However, they did not know about this until after the show because they were not allowed to be in contact with anyone outside of the \"Big Brother\" house. The show had to even put disclaimers before the episodes started to inform viewers that the comments made by houseguests were not the opinions of CBS."}

Of the six dead, two were killed in the railway station, two are from Limoges, and two from \u00c9tampes. 385 passengers were on board at the time of the crash. The crash occurred at 17:14 local time, 22 minutes after the train left Austerlitz station at 16:53. If the train had been on schedule, it would have arrived in Limoges at 20:05. The trains and platforms at Br\u00e9tigny were very busy as it was the Friday before the Bastille Day holiday weekend.\nThe train was not supposed to stop at the station. According to the first reports, the train crashed at high speed and split in two pieces after the third and fourth cars derailed. The crash caused the back four carts to crash into the station platforms. The accident is the most serious rail crash that has happened in France since the 1988 Gare de Lyon rail accident in which 56 people were killed.\nThe French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA-TT) has announced a search into the accident. SNCF released its findings on 13 July. The company reported that the derailment seemed to have been caused by a track failure. According to SNCF, a steel fishplate connecting two rails had come loose from the station at a set of points, and had become stuck in a track switch. The third and fourth carts came off track when their wheels went over the steel plate. When the problem with the switch became known, SNCF had people check the several thousand such switches on the network.\nThe track has been severely damaged on a length of about . Repairing the track means that the railway station will be closed for all traffic for several days. This also affects Gare d'Austerlitz in Paris, as most trains starting from there take this route.\nSeveral people reported that the firefighters and rescuers were aggressed, when they arrived, and that stones were thown. Police had to be called to secure the area. The same report also speaks about a group of youngsters pillaging and stealing from the passengers of the train. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Riffaud, the director of the Red Cross later declared, that the teams were able to work without being aggressed. On 13 July, a police source was quoted as saying that police forces had projectiles thrown at them, but that these were isolated cases, and that no stones had been used."}

There are two main groups of coral snakes. These groups are Old World coral snakes and New World coral snakes. \nCoral snakes have notable red, yellow/white, and black colored banding. Most species of coral snake are small. North American species average around in length, but specimens of up to or slightly larger have been reported. Coral snakes that live in water have flat tails. These tails act like a fin to help the snake swim.\nLike all elapid snakes, coral snakes have a pair of small fangs to deliver their venom (some coral snakes are rear fanged). These fangs, which are enlarged and hollow, deliver their venom to their prey species. Coral snakes mostly eat smaller snakes, lizards, frogs, and nestling birds and rodents, etc. The venom takes time to take full effect.\nCoral snakes often hold on to a victim when biting, unlike vipers. Vipers have retractable fangs and tend to prefer to strike and let go immediately. Coral snakes are not aggressive or prone to biting. They account for less than one percent of the number of snake bites each year in the United States.\nCoral snakes in the U.S.A..\nNew World coral snakes live in the southern range of many temperate U.S. states. They are found in the southern coastal plain from North Carolina to Louisiana, including all of Florida. \nThere is debate about whether the Texas coral snake is a separate species. Its habitat, in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, is separated from the eastern habitat by the Mississippi River. The coral snake population is most dense in the southeast United States, but coral snakes have been spotted as far north as Kentucky.\nThe Arizona coral snake, which is a separate genus, is found in central and southern Arizona, extreme southwestern New Mexico and southward to Sinaloa in western Mexico. It lives in dry regions in thornscrub, desert-scrub, woodland, grassland and farmland. It is found in the plains and lower mountain slopes from sea level to 5800 feet (1768 m); often in rocky areas."}

The battle actually has two names: the First Battle of Bull Run and First Battle of Manassas.\nBackground.\nUnion general Irvin McDowell was put in command of the Union army in northeastern Virginia. Many people in the North wanted him to attack to Confederate capital city of Richmond, Virginia. McDowell didn't think his soldiers were ready to fight but Union president Abraham Lincoln wanted him to march south into Virginia anyway.\nThe Confederates had an army nearby, which was commanded by P.G.T. Beauregard. After McDowell's army started marching towards Beauregard's army, Joseph E. Johnston came to Manassas Junction with his army from the Shenandoah Valley. Johnston was in command of the entire Confederate army and Beauregard was his second-in-command.\nThe Battle.\nThe battle started early in the morning on July 21st. McDowell started marching part of his army around the left end of the Confederate army. The two armies started shooting at each other about 6 a.m. near Matthews Hill. The Confederates did not expect the Union army to attack but they moved brigades to their left flank.\nMcDowell made the Confederates leave Matthews Hill about 11 a.m. The Confederates retreated back to another hill called Henry House Hill. On the hill was Thomas J. Jackson's brigade. Another Confederate general was trying to regroup his men. He said, \"There stands Jackson standing like a stonewall\". After the battle Jackson would be called \"Stonewall\".\nThe Union army made many attacks on the Confederate line on Henry House Hill. All of the attacks failed. In the afternoon the Confederates made an attack of their own. This drove the Union army back towards Washington, D.C. The Confederates were too tired to march after the Union army.\nAftermath.\nThe Union army had 2,896 casualties. McDowell was blamed for the Union defeat. He was replaced by George B. McClellan. The Confederates had 1,982 casualties. Even though Johnston was in charge of the Confederate army, Beauregard became famous after the battle."}

In some cases, a poorly-written program may incorrectly manage the memory that has been given to it. As a consequence, the memory that was actually supposed to be reused after the program has finished its job cannot be accessed again. This is known as a memory leak.\nOne of the most common reasons for memory leaks is the program not giving its memory back after it has finished execution. \nMemory leaks may result in several issues such as degradation of performance and systems being unresponsive."}

He is best known as being the voice of Mario in the \"Mario\" series of video games since 1995. He also voices Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, Toadsworth, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and others. He was born in San Jose, California.\nCareer.\nWorking for\u00a0Nintendo\u00a0since 1994, Martinet started voicing\u00a0Mario\u00a0at video game\u00a0trade shows\u00a0in which attendees would walk up to a TV screen displaying a 3-D Mario head that moved around the screen and talked. This system was called \"Mario in Real-Time\" or \"MIRT\". Martinet could see the attendees by means of a hidden camera setup, and a facial\u00a0motion capture\u00a0rig recorded his mouth movements in order to synchronize Martinet's mouth movement with the on-screen Mario mouth movement. This\u00a0digital puppetry, with Martinet's comic performance, was a novelty at the time.\nMartinet was told by his friend that there was going to be an audition at a trade show in which you \"talk to people as a plumber\". He went to the audition at the last minute as the casting directors were already putting away their equipment. Charles Martinet walked in and asked, \"Can I please read for this?\". The directors let him\u00a0audition\u00a0and told him, \"You're an Italian plumber from\u00a0Brooklyn\". At first Martinet planned to talk like a\u00a0stereotypical\u00a0Italian American\u00a0with a deep, raspy voice (which is how Mario sounded in the\u00a0Super \"Mario Bros. Super Show\",\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 3\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Super Mario World\"cartoons). He then thought to himself that it would be too harsh for children to hear, so he made it more soft-hearted and friendly, resulting in what Mario's voice is today. Martinet has also stated that he kept on talking with his Mario voice until the audition tape ran out.[1]\nMartinet's video game voice over debut was as Mario in the 1995 Windows release of Interplay's game\u00a0\"Mario's FUNdamentals\". However, most were first exposed to Mario's voice in the landmark 1996 game\u00a0\"Super Mario 64\". He has voiced Mario, Luigi,\u00a0Wario,\u00a0Waluigi, Toadsworth, Metal Mario, Shadow Mario,\u00a0Donkey Kong,[2]\u00a0MC Ballyhoo, Mini-Mario Toy, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi and Baby Wario in most games wherein these characters speak. He also voiced the enemiesWart,\u00a0Mouser,\u00a0Tryclyde, and\u00a0Clawgrip\u00a0in\u00a0\"Super Mario Advance\". His voice work appears in the English and Japanese-language versions of the games, although his work is always in English (regardless of the Italian references whenever he voices Mario and related characters).\nMartinet provided voiceover acting for the boxers and the announcer in the\u00a0Super NES\u00a0title\u00a0\"Super Punch-Out!!\". He voiced the character Vigoro in\u00a0Sega's\u00a0Dreamcastand\u00a0Nintendo GameCube\u00a0role-playing video game,\u00a0\"Skies of Arcadia\". He did the voice of Homunculus in the Konami\u00a0PlayStation 2,\u00a0Xbox\u00a0and Windows game\u00a0\"Shadow of Destiny\", and provided voices for\u00a0\"Reader Rabbit\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"The ClueFinders\"\u00a0games.\nIn addition to videogame voice overs, Martinet has worked as a voice actor in commercials, cartoons, and promotions. At the\u00a0E3\u00a0trade show in 2005, Charles (as an\"Animal Crossing\"\u00a0character) could be found roaming the virtual\u00a0village\u00a0featured in the playable demo of\u00a0\"Animal Crossing: Wild World\". Martinet did Mario's voice as the voice announcer for\u00a0\"Pac-Man Vs.\"\u00a0on the Nintendo GameCube.\nOther than the Mario series, Charles has also done work for the video game\u00a0\"Cel Damage\"\u00a0as the voice of Fowl Mouth, as well as the primary voice work in several educational game series such as\u00a0LeapFrog.[2]\u00a0He also voiced the dragon Paarthurnax in the 2011 video game\u00a0\"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\", and narrated the cutscenes and menus for the 2013 video game\u00a0\"Bit.Trip Presents Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien\".[3]"}

The war was fought between the navies of England and the Dutch Republic (also known as the United Provinces). It mainly took place in the English Channel and the North Sea.

England tried to end the Dutch monopoly over world trade. Most of the fighting in both wars was done in the North Sea. In the Third War, England fought alongside France.

It was originally bred in Tosa (present day K\u014dchi) as a fighting dog and still today is a known fighting dog.\nAppearance.\nThe Japanese breed generally weighs between 40 and 60\u00a0kg, while the non-Japanese breeders have focused on dogs that weigh from 55 to 95\u00a0kg and stand 24.5 to 31 inches (62 to 80\u00a0cm) at the withers.\nThe coat is characterized by its short and smooth appearance and is often red, brindle, or fawn. Occasionally it can be a dull black, but this is somewhat rare. Maintenance of the coat is usually minimal. Dogs should be very muscular and athletic. Tosa is a very resistant to pain and physical exhaustion.\nHistory.\nThis breed originated in the second half of the nineteenth century in Japan. The breed started from the native Shikoku-Inu, an indigenous dog weighing about 25 kilograms (45 pounds) and standing about 55 centimetres high, which closely resembles the European Spitz. These dogs were crossed with European dog breeds, such as the Old English Bulldog in 1872, Mastiff in 1874, St. Bernard, German Pointer in 1876, Great Dane in 1924, and the Bull Terrier. The aim was to breed a larger, more powerful and very fast agile fighting dog. Today it is still used in some countries as a fighting dog, but usually it is kept as a pet where it is ideal companion. In family environment Tosa is patient and very friendly in attitude."}

The main purpose of these components is to store data. The central processing unit is then able to fetch and change the data. In most computers, there is a computer memory hierarchy: Memory that is \"closer\" to the CPU is usually faster to access, but it is also smaller; data that is stored in this kind of memory usually needs electrical power to keep the data.\nMemory that is farther away is usually slower to access, but also bigger. Classical storage media of this kind of data include hard drives and USB flash drives. Some media offer even more capacity, but accessing them is very slow. Examples for such media are tape drives. Modern CPUs have registers that can store data, they also often have several levels of cache.\nFinally, there is the main memory the CPU can access. These three are usually referred to as \"Primary\" data storage. Some computers also have a cache memory.\nSecondary storage is usually not directly accessible by the CPU, and data needs to be transferred to primary storage to be available. Secondary storage includes hard drives and non-volatile random-access memory. Tertiary storage is used for archival and backup; very often it is copied to secondary storage before use. Software is sometimes distributed by tertiary media such as magnetic tape and CD-ROM."}

It was published in parts between 1825 and 1832. The first complete edition was published in 1833, and the currently accepted version is based on the 1837 publication.\nAlmost the entire work is made up of 389 stanzas of iambic tetrameter with the unusual rhyme scheme \"AbAbCCddEffEgg\". This form has come to be known as the \"Onegin stanza\" or the \"Pushkin sonnet.\"\nThe story is told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate. The narrator digresses at times, commenting on aspects of the social and intellectual world. This helps develop the characters and the drama of the plot.\nAn opera \"Eugene Onegin\" by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky has been composed based upon the book.\nThe storyline.\nOnegin, a nobleman who has just taken over his uncle's estate, is a fine young dandy, but bored and cynical. He does not value shy, bookish Tatyana Larina. Soon after their meeting she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter. She expresses her love for him.\nOnegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances. This famous speech is often referred to as 'Onegin's Sermon' He admits that the letter was touching, but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship. He advises her to keep more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.\nAs their lives develop. His life falls apart after he kills his best friend in a duel. On the other hand, her life blossoms.\nYears pass, and he attends a society ball in St. Petersburg. He sees a beautiful woman who captures the attention of everyone. He realizes her as Tatyana. Now she is married to an aged prince. He becomes obsessed with winning her affection, despite the fact that she is married. However, his attempts are rebuffed. He writes her several letters, but receives no reply.\nEventually Onegin manages to see Tatyana, and offers her the opportunity to renew their past love. She recalls the days when they might have been happy, but that time has passed. Onegin repeats his love for her. Faltering for a moment, she admits that she still loves him, but she will not allow him to ruin her. She declares her determination to remain faithful to her husband. She leaves him to his bitter regrets."}
