It lasted until November 30. These dates usually mark the beginning an the end of the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the 2004 season went past these actual limits slightly. For example, Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the season and lasted two days into December. The season was above average in activity. It had fifteen named storms and one of the highest Accumulated Cyclone Energy totals ever recorded. The most season included storms called: Hurricane Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne.\nStorms.\nHurricane Alex.\nHurricane Alex formed on July 31 off the coast of South Carolina. Alex quickly strengthened into a category 2. On August 3, Hurricane Alex came within 10 miles of North Carolina. Hurricane Alex turned northeast and dissipated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Because Hurricane Alex did not make landfall it only caused $2.4 million in damage and only 1 person was killed as a result of the hurricane.\nTropical Storm Bonnie.\nBonnie started as Tropical Depression Two while east of Barbados. Tropical Depression Two crossed the Windward Islands and died out shortly after. It became Tropical Depression Two again while it was south of Cuba. Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall in the Florida Panhandle. Bonnie died out again after that. Bonnie left only about $1 million in damage and 4 deaths. \nFor the official forecasts, see:\nHurricane Charley.\nHurricane Charley was a strong hurricane that strengthened very fast. Charley also made landfall further south then he was supposed to. Charley left $16.5 billion in damage and 35 deaths. The damage caused by Charley made it the second costliest storm in U.S. history, only to Hurricane Andrew. This beaten by four other storms within 4 years, it was beaten by Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Wilma, then Hurricane Ike. That makes Charley the fifth costliest storm in U.S. history. \nFor the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Charley.\nHurricane Danielle.\nDanielle was a category 2 hurricane of 2004. It started on August 13 in the far east Atlantic Ocean. The path took it over cooler waters, which caused Danielle to die on August 21.\nFor the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Danielle.\nTropical Storm Earl.\nOn August 13 Tropical Depression Five formed. On August 14 it became Tropical Storm Earl. Tropical Storm Earl passed south of Grenada and became a tropical wave. It was no longer a tropical storm. Later on the remains became Hurricane Frank in the Pacific Ocean. See also 2004 Pacific hurricane season for information on Earl after it crossed oceans.\nHurricane Frances.\nFrances was one of the four hurricanes to have a major impact of the U.S. state of Florida. Frances made landfall near the same location Hurricane Jeanne would make landfall in about two weeks later. Frances caused about 101 tornadoes from Florida to Virginia. Frances killed 49 people and $12 billion in damage.\nHurricane Gaston.\nGaston started as Tropical Depression Seven on August 27. It strengthened into a tropical storm. Later on it strengthened into a hurricane very shortly before landfall in South Carolina on August 29. On August 30 it moved back into the Atlantic Ocean. Gaston died on September 1, after killing 9 people and causing $120 million in damage. \nTropical Storm Hermine.\nHermine started about 360 miles south of Bermuda. It moved west and became a tropical storm. Hermine moved quickly north and on August 31 made landfall in New Bedford, Massachusetts as a weak tropical storm. Hermine died on the same day after killing no one and causing little damage. \nHurricane Ivan.\nHurricane Ivan was the strongest hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed as a Cape Verde-type hurricane in early September, and became the ninth named storm, the sixth hurricane, and the fourth major hurricane of the year. Ivan reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the highest possible category and the only one of the season. At the time it was sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record.\nFor official forecasts see:\nTropical Depression Ten.\nTropical Depression Ten was the only depression of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Ten formed in the northeast Atlantic on September 7 and dissipated two days later, Tropical Depression Ten caused no affects to land.\nFor official forecasts, see the NHC's advisory archive on Tropical Depression Ten\nHurricane Jeanne.\nHurricane Jeanne was a deadly storm, especially to Haiti. The storm cause 3,035 deaths, about 3,006 were in Haiti alone. Hurricane Jeanne was also a costly hurricane. With $7 billion in damage makes it the 13th costliest hurricane in U.S. History. In Florida the hurricane made landfall in the same area as Hurricane Frances only two weeks before.\nFor official forecasts see:\nHurricane Karl.\nHurricane Karl was a strong category 4 that only affected the Faroe Islands. Karl formed in the middle of the Atlantic on September 16 as Tropical Depression Twelve. It became a tropical storm that same day. Two days later it became a hurricane and by September 21 it became a category 4 and soon reached it highest winds of 145\u00a0mph. It continued north weakening and then becoming extratropical on September 24.\nFor official forecasts see the NHC's public advisory archive on Hurricane Karl.\nHurricane Lisa.\nLisa was a category 1 hurricane, it remained weak for much of its early life. After almost 14 days it finally became a hurricane. Hurricane Lisa started on September 19 and died on October 3. \nFor official forecasts see the NHC's public advisory archive on Hurricane Lisa.\nTropical Storm Matthew.\nMatthew was a weak tropical storm. It started in the Gulf of Mexico on October 8. Tropical Storm Matthew made landfall in Louisiana on October 10, and died on the same day. The storm caused $300,000 in damage.\nFor official forecasts see: \nSubtropical Storm Nicole.\nSubtropical Storm Nicole was the only subtropical storm in 2004. Nicole formed on October 10 southwest of Bermuda. Subtropical Storm Nicole dissipated the next day. Nicole caused swells to the East Coast of The United States and almost 6\u00a0inches of rain in Bermuda.\nFor official forecasts, see the NHC's public advisory archive on Subtropical Storm Nicole.\nTropical Storm Otto.\nTropical Storm Otto formed late in the season of November 29 and on the same day, Tropical Storm Otto reached it's highest winds of 50\u00a0mph. Otto then dissipated on December 3.\nFor official forecasts, see the NHC's public advisory archive on Tropical Storm Otto.\nStorm names.\nThe list is the names that were set aside for the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Name that were not used are marked in .\nRetirement.\nIn the spring of 2005 four names were retired. They are Charley, Frances, Jeanne and Ivan. In 2010 they were replaced with Colin, Fiona, Igor, Julia."}

It is useless to all except a few bacteria and archaea. Biological nitrogen fixation converts into ammonia, which is used (metabolized) by most organisms.\nNitrogen is fixed in biological and non-biological ways:\nBiological.\nMicroorganisms that fix nitrogen (diazotrophs).\nCyanobacteria are in most environments on Earth. They play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere. Cyanobacteria use many sources of combined nitrogen, like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino acids. \nSeveral cyanobacteria are also diazotrophs which can fix nitrogen from the air. This is an ability which may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archaean. \nCyanobacteria in coral reefs can fix twice the amount of nitrogen than on land\u2014around 1.8\u00a0kg of nitrogen is fixed per hectare per day. The colonial marine cyanobacterium \"Trichodesmium\" may fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen-fixation in marine systems on a global scale.\nRoot nodule symbioses.\nLegume family.\nPlants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family\u00a0\u2013 Fabaceae\u00a0\u2013 with taxa such as kudzu, clovers, soybeans, alfalfa, lupines, peanuts, and rooibos. They have symbiotic bacteria called \"Rhizobia\" in nodules in their root systems, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed \nnitrogen is released, making it available to other plants and this helps to fertilize the soil. Most legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., \"Styphnolobium\") do not. In traditional farming practice, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually includes one consisting mainly or entirely of clover or buckwheat (non-legume family \"Polygonaceae\"), which are often referred to as \"green manure\".\nNon-leguminous.\nAlthough most plants able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules are in the legume family Fabaceae, there are a few exceptions:\nAll these families belong to the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales, which together with the Fabales form a clade. In this clade, Fabales were the first lineage to branch off; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen was lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant. \nBiological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Hermann Hellnegel (18311895) and Martinus Beijerinck (18511931)."}

Nitrogen chemicals are needed for life. Nitrogen is a necessary part of proteins, DNA, and RNA. In plants, nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth. However, living things cannot use the elemental nitrogen in the air for these things. Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air (N2) into forms that can be used by life. Most nitrogen fixation is done by microorganisms called bacteria. These bacteria have an enzyme that combines N2 with hydrogen gas (H2) to make ammonia (NH3). \nSome of these bacteria live in the roots of plants (mostly legumes). In these roots, they make ammonia for the plant and the plant gives them carbohydrates. Other plants take nitrogen compounds out of the soil through their roots. All nitrogen in animals comes from eating plants.\nAmmonium (NH4) in soil is made by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and decomposers, bacteria and fungi that break down dead life into its parts. This process is called \"ammonification\". Ammonium has a positive charge. It easily joins to clay and humus in the soil. Ammonia and ammonium are poisonous to fish and other animals. Sewage and other waste-water is regularly measured because of this. If ammonia levels are too high, \"nitrification\" must happen. \nNitrification is the oxidation of ammonia and ammonium to nitrite (NO2\u2212) and then to nitrate ( NO3\u2212) by bacteria. Because nitrite and nitrate have a negative charge they do not easily join to soil and will wash out of the soil during rain and irrigation. High nitrate levels in drinking water is harmful for babies and can cause blue-baby syndrome. High nitrate levels can also cause too much algae growth in lakes and pools. This eutrophication can be harmful to fish and other water animals. The use of fertilizers is controlled because of this. \nWhere there is no oxygen, some bacteria will make nitrate into nitrogen gas (N2) to extract energy. This starts the nitrogen cycle over again. This process is called \"denitrification\"."}

He was awarded the Stalin Prize for its construction, in 1949. The building was the largest skyscraper outside New York for a long time. It was the tallest buildimg in Europe, until 1988. The central tower is 240m high. It has 36-stories. It is flanked by four huge wings of student and faculty accommodations. It is said to contain a total of 33 kilometers of corridors and 5,000 rooms. Facilities that are inside the building include a concert hall, a theatre, a museum, various administration services, a library, a swimming pool, a police station, a post office, a laundry, a hairdresser's salon, a canteen, bank offices, shops, cafeterias, and a bomb shelter. Along with the university administration, four of the main faculties - Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Geology, the Faculty of Geography, and the Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts - now are in the Main building. The star on the top of the tower is large enough so that it has a small room and a viewing platform; it weighs 12 tons. The building's facades are decorated with giant clocks, barometers, and thermometers, statues, carved wheat sheaves, and Soviet crests (recently renovated). It stands before a terrace featuring statues of male and female students gazing optimistically and confidently into the future."}

This means that as well as having to pay to sleep there, students have to pay for their education. \nIn Ghana most secondary schools are boarding.\nFamous private boarding schools include Eton College, Rugby School and Harrow School in the United Kingdom, Phillips Exeter Academy in the United States and Cornway College in Zimbabwe.\nThere are therapeutic boarding schools which offer treatment for psychological difficulties. Special needs education for children are catered for in some boarding schools. Some boarding schools offer 'democratic education', such as Summerhill School (where pupils make many of the decisions). Others are determinedly international, such as the United World Colleges. Military schools or academies provide discipline and may offer a way into military service. Gordonstoun in Scotland is a co-educational school for both day and boarding pupils.\nSome famous novels use boarding schools as their setting. Examples include the\" Harry Potter\" series by J.K.

Legge was not a conductor, but he was a man who organized a lot of music, especially recordings. The orchestra spent most of their time making gramophone recordings, but sometimes they also gave concerts. The conductor Thomas Beecham led their first concert in 1946, but Beecham had always organized his own orchestras and he wanted to organize this one. He even wanted to change the orchestra\u2019s name. The players decided that they did not want Beecham as their conductor. Beecham went on to form another orchestra which he called the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\nIn the first years of the Philharmonia they were conducted by several world-famous conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and, especially, Herbert von Karajan. Karajan helped the orchestra to become one of the finest in the world, and he made many recordings with them, including all the Beethoven symphonies.\nIn 1954 Karajan left to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Legge found another world-famous conductor, Otto Klemperer. Although he was already quite old, Klemperer made many excellent recordings with the orchestra. In 1959 the orchestra gave Klemperer the title of Music Director for the rest of his life.\nIn 1964 Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end. Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue, so the orchestra made their own organizing body (like other London orchestras) and they continued, calling themselves by a new name: the \"New Philharmonia Orchestra\". They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 9\", conducted by Klemperer.\nThe orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self-governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it got its old name \u201cPhilharmonia Orchestra\u201d back again in 1977, and has been known by that name ever since.\nKlemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973. Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Christoph von Dohn\u00e1nyi and Esa-Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008.\nConcerts Today.\nToday, the orchestra continues to give many concerts, travelling around Britain as well as abroad. Since 1995 they have been based in the Royal Festival Hall in London. They also give regular concerts at De Montfort Hall, Leicester and the Corn Exchange, Bedford. Abroad they often play in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\nRecordings.\nThe Philharmonia has made more than one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including such classics as Laurence Olivier's 1944 film version of Shakespeare's \"Henry V\", and David Lean's film version of \"Oliver Twist\" (1948)."}

They live today in almost every part of the world, even many countries that are not their natural habitats.\nThe wild boar is native to Eurasia and North Africa. Wild boars are omnivorous and easily adapt to changes. They were hunted in Europe from long ago for many of their body parts, and were shown in the mythology of many ancient civilizations. Greek, Phoenician, and Persian mythology showed them as fierce, sometimes evil, while others showed them as brave, powerful animals. Again, others saw them as parasitic. Even today many people see wild boars very differently.\nThe hair of the boar was often used when making the toothbrush until the 1930s. The hair for the bristles usually came from the neck area of the boar. The brushes were popular because the bristles were soft. However, this was not the best material for oral hygiene because the hairs dried slowly and usually held bacteria.\nAppearance.\nThe body of the wild boar, when seen from the side, often looks very big. This impression is partly because, compared to the large body mass, the legs of the wild boar are short and do not look very strong. The wild boar's head is very large. Its eyes are high up on the head, while the ears are small with bristles around it. Its tail can move very quickly, and the wild boar often uses it to show when his mood. If seen from the front, the body looks quite narrow. The wild boar has 44 teeth in its jaw, which helps its strong bite. The male and the female wild boars' snout shapes are different.\nPiglets.\nA wild boar usually gives birth to about 4 \u2013 6 piglets at a time. Piglets weigh from about 750 \u2013 1000g when they are first born. They are fully weaned after 3 \u2013 4 months. They begin eating solid foods such as worms and grubs after about 2 weeks.\nIn culture.\nWild boar appears in European culture as symbol of warrior virtues. It also appears in Greek, Norse mythologies, vaishnavism, hinduism. "}

In this form, Vishnu had the body of a man, but he had a head of a lion. This avatar of Vishnu is also a symbol of great strength. \nThe Hindu scriptures tell this story about Narashimha. There was a demon (a \"daitya\") named Hiranyakashipu. He was against all gods. But, his son named Prahlad used to worship the gods, especially Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu was not happy at his son and wanted to burn him to death. Hiranyakashipu also wanted to kill everyone who worshipped the gods and make everyone worship him instead. Vishnu became Narasimha, and protected Prahlad and other people who worshipped the gods by stopping Hiranyakashipu. Brahma had granted Hiranyakashipu a boon that kept him safe so that he could not be killed by a human, animal or deva. He also could not be killed in the day or night, or inside or outside of his palace. This made Hiranyakashipu believe that no one could kill him. When he wanted to kill his son for worshiping Vishnu, Vishnu came to earth incarnated as a half-man, half-lion creature (neither man nor human). This way Vishnu killed Hiranyakashipu in the twilight (neither day, nor night) and on the porch of the palace (neither inside, nor outside), without disrupting the boon given to him by Brahma. Now, Narasimha Jayanti is celebrated across the world."}

Some Jews only wear yarmulkes while praying; others wear yarmulkes the entire day, making sure not to walk more than four cubits without head covering (especially outside).\nThe basis for wearing a head covering is a story in the Talmud (tractate Shabbat).\nOften, the color and fabric of the \"yarmulke\" can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement.

According to anthropologists, pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than tall on average. The best known pygmies are the Aka, Ef\u00e9 and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil. The Negritos of Southeast Asia are also called pygmies.\nThe word \"pygmy\" is sometimes thought to be pejorative (an insult). It is, however, the only word that is used to call \"all\" African Midgets.\n The word Bayaka is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies. In the Congo Basin, pygmies are called the Kongo word Bambenga.\nName.\nThe name \"pygmy\" comes from the Greek word (\"pygmaios\"). This word was derived from (came from) the word which is the length between a person's elbow and knuckles. The Latin word (pl. \"pygmaei\") came from this older Greek word.\nThe word was first used in Greek mythology by the poet Homer. He wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called \"Pygmies\" who lived in India and Ethiopia. \nOrigins.\nThere are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short. It has been proved that their height is hereditary, and is passed on from parents to children. It may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests, where many pygmies live. This would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin D in their skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is important for bones to grow. Since the pygmies would get less calcium, they would have smaller bones and skeletons.\nThere are other explanations for why pygmies are so short. Some explanations are: \nSome research shows that the genes for the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone are found much less in pygmies than in related tribes. These genes are important for humans to grow tall. \nAfrica.\nPygmies can be found in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. Most of these groups are partly hunter-gatherers. They get food from the environment and trade it with nearby farmers. From the farmers they get crops and tools. There are about 250,000-600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest.\nGroups.\nThere are a number of Pygmy groups living in Africa. The three best-known groups are the Mbenga, Mbuti, and Twa groups. Each big group includes several tribes that have their own language. \nThe Mbenga people, sometimes called the \"Ba-Mbenga\", live in the western Congo basin. The Mbenga include the Aka people, who speak the Aka language. The Aka live in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo. The M-Benz\u00e9l\u00e9 people, or \"western Aka\", and the Ba-Sese people, \"eastern Aka\", are also related. \nOther Mbenga pygmies are the Baka people of Cameroon, Gabon, and Republic of Congo. They speak three very similar languages: Baka language, Ganzi language, and Gundi language. Another group of Mbenga pygmies are the Gyele people. The Gyele live in Cameroon and speak Gyele language.\nThe Mbuti people, sometimes called the \"Bambuti\", live in the Ituri rainforest in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. They include the Ef\u00e9 people, Asua people, and the Kango people. The Ef\u00e9 speak the Ef\u00e9 language. The Asua speak the Asoa language. The Kango speak the Kango language.\nThe Twa people, or \"Ba-Twa\", live in Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda. The Twa speak Kirundi and Kinyarwanda."}
{"id": "68227", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68227", "title": "Itihasa", "text": " \nIn Sanskrit, Itihasa means history. For Hindus, an Itihasa is a story that tells about what happened in the past in the land of India. Itihasas are usually epic poems. The important itihasas to Hindus are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Modern excavations and archaeological evidences are slowly beginning to find evidences to prove these Indian epics as actual history. \nThe original meaning of Itiihaasa had a more precise connotation than the word History. The etymology attested to by Panini indicates itiha to mean \u2018thus indeed, in this tradition\u2019 . \nOne of the earliest references to Itihaasa in the literature of antiquity is in Chanakyas\u2019s Arthashastra. Our investigations lead us to believe that the Maurya empire for which he was the preceptor began in 1534 BCE. He defines Itihaasa, in the context of the syllabus prescribed for training of a Prince, with the following words;\n\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0935\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0926\u093e\u0939\u0930\u0923\u0902 \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u091a\u0947\u0924\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0938\u0903\nPuraana (the chronicles of the ancients), Itivrtta (history), Akhyayika (tales), Udaaharana (illustrative stories), Dharmashastra (the canon of Righteous conduct), and Arthashastra (the science of Government) are known by (comprise the corpus of Itihaasah, ) History\nKautilya\u2019s Arthashastra, Book 1, Chapter 5\nThus, History in this definition takes on the meaning more akin to the sense of Historiography and is perhaps even more eclectic and appears to indicate a superset of political science and History as we use them today. We feel vindicated therefore in calling our forthcoming conference a conference on Indian History ( http://www.india-forum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=2088), since we seem to ascribe the same broad meaning that Kautilya did 3 millennia ago.\nThe quintessential quote is that of Kalhana in the Rajatarangini,12th century CE (1147 to 1149 CE) who is regarded as a modern in Indian parlance\n\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0915\u093e\u092e\u092e\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0923\u093e\u092e\u0941\u092a\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0964\n\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0915\u0925\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0942\u092a\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0938\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091a\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u0947 \u0964\u0964\n\u201cDharmaartha-kaama-moskshanaam upadesa-samanvitam | \nPuraa-vrttam, kathaa-yuttarupam Ithihaasah prachakshate ||\u201d \nHistory will be the narration of events as they happened, in the form of a story, which will be an advice to the reader to be followed in life, to gain the purusaarthas namely Kama the satiation of desires through Artha the tool, by following the path of Dharma the human code of conduct to gain Moksha or liberation. \nClearly there is an emphasis on the traditions and on the utilitarian aspect of History, embedded in the etymology of Itihaasa. The reason we draw emphasis to the ambiguity in the use of the word History is that, in our usage, while we adhere to the broader usage of the word History, it makes for clarity in usage if the Civilizational aspects are distinguished into distinct categories"}

It is the equivalent of Nirvana in Buddhism. In the Sanskrit language, \"moksha\" means freedom. It is as a state of eternal bliss and emptiness. According to Vedanta life is an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth into a physical universe. Hindu scriptures describe Moksha as the spiritual liberation from this cycle and the achievement of an eternal and blissful emptiness that transcends all of the joys, pain, and sorrow of the physical body or corporeal life. It is the goal of Hindu practitioners to achieve Moksha (freedom/liberation from the material world) through the practice of Yoga viz Jnana Yoga(knowledge), Karma Yoga(work), and Bhakti Yoga (through reciting prayers and worshipping God). \nMoksha is a Vedic term. Scholars disagree about the precise relationship between the Moksha of Vedanta Hinduism and the Nirvana of Buddhism, but there is agreement that they are closely related historically and philosophically. Similarities can be found between Moksha and some concepts found in the Upanishads. Hindu texts explain the Moksha as Sat-Chit-Anand [True blissness of soul by separating the soul from the physical body by practising Dhyan and Yoga ]. Moksha originates from the Sanskrit word, moksa.\nIn short, moksha symbolizes something which is beyond comprehension; too great and too wondrous to be truly understood, it can only be felt when one attains it. The world is truly a beautiful place, but the greatness that lies within is even more so, since the power of the greatness is completely unknown. \nAfter all, isn't that what beauty is; appreciation of the unknown! \nFor a more comprehensive explanation of this topic read the books:\nMoksha is the ultimate goal of a person to get liberated from the cycle of birth and death"}

They are called \"Dwij\" because they guided others toward enlightenment.\nCaste system.\nThe caste system classified people by jobs. The people in this caste were mostly priests and dramatists in the Aryan society. The Brahmins arranged prayers and rituals.

Parshurama is also Creator Father of Bhumihar Brahman and Bhumihar Thakur, Bhumihar's are also known as Parashurama Brahman &amp; Bramhkshatriya.

Across the subcontinent, other Brahmins are also believed to have switched from the traditional duties of Brahmins in favor of military and administrative ones. In other parts of the subcontinent, outside of Punjab and the Gandhara region, they have been known as the Tyagi Brahman and \"brahma-kshatriya\" groups. These groups also claim to have descended from the Parshuram Tyagi Brahmans of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh; traditionally, they have a close relationship and brotherhood with Mohyals.\nSome Mohyal Brahmins migrated eastward and became as some sub-divisions of Bhumihar Brahmins, some of whom are also descendants of Hussaini Brahmins and mourn the death of Imam Hussain.[7] Bhumihar Brahmins and Tyagi/ Mohyal Brahmins have an affinity and brotherhood for each other.

In the Otogizoshi, a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period, Tamamo-no-Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe. She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan. Tamamo-no-Mae's body mysteriously always smelled wonderful, and her clothes never became dirty. Tamamo-no-Mae was not only beautiful, but she was very wise in all subjects. Although she appeared to be only twenty years old, there was no question that she could not answer. She answered every question posed to her, whether about music, religion, or astronomy. Because of her beauty and intelligence, everyone in the Imperial Court adored her, and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her.\nAfter some time had passed, the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill. He went to many priests and fortune-tellers for answers, but they had none to offer. Finally, an astrologer told the Emperor that Tamamo-no-Mae was the cause of his illness. The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact an evil fox with nine tails (kitsune), who was making the Emperor ill in a evil plan to take the throne. Following this, Tamamo-no-Mae disappeared from the court.\nThe Emperor ordered Kazusa-no-suke and Miura-no-suke, the most powerful warriors of the day, to hunt and kill the fox. After escaping from the hunters for some time, the fox appeared to Miura-no-suke in a dream. Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae, the fox told Miura-nosuke would kill it the next day, and begged for its life. Miura-no-suke refused.\nEarly the next day, the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu, and Miura-no-suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow. The body of the fox became the Sessho-seki, or Killing Stone, which kills anyone that comes in contact with it. Tamamo-no-Mae's spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone.\nHoji is said to have haunted this stone in the Japanese prefecture of Nasu until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji. Genno did a certain spiritual ritual, and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation, until finally Hoji surrendered and swore to never haunt the stone again.\nIn Matsuo Bash\u014d's famous book, \"The Narrow Road to the Deep North\" (Oku no Hosomichi), Bash\u014d tells of visiting the stone in the Japanese prefecture of Nasu.\nTamamo-no-Mae's legend served as base for the noh drama \"Sesshoseki\" (\"The Killing Stone\") and the kabuki play \"Tamamonomae\" (or \"The Beautiful Fox Witch\")."}

Sometimes people play the game by changing the way the imaginary robot is set up at the start to watch what happens. The Game of Life is a zero-player game because it changes without anybody playing (after the starting position is chosen). A different type of game lets two players set up imaginary robots to see which one is better.\nRules.\nThe game is played on a grid of squares called \"cells\", each cell is black (alive) or white (dead). When people are playing the game, they start by making some dead cells alive. Then the alive cells can make other cells alive or dead because of the rules of the game. The rules are:\nThe way a player sets up the first alive cells starts the game. The first level (generation) is made by using the 4 rules. After the player is done changing the cells, they do the same thing all over again to make the next level. The game is over when all the cells are dead or all the cells are alive or the game is doing the same thing over and over. The Game of Life is Turing-complete.\nHistory.\nJohn Horton Conway made the Game of Life because he wanted to know if he could make an imaginary robot out of cells that would be able to get bigger. He combined lots of ideas in math to make the rules for the game. It is one of the first ever 'simulation games' that represent things that happen in real life. It is important because when used in complicated math, it can look at many things like physics, biology, economics, and philosophy.\nPatterns.\nPatterns are special things that happen in the game. Many different types of patterns happen, including static patterns where nothing changes between levels, repeating patterns where the cells that are alive and dead repeat, and patterns that move themselves across the board (\"spaceships\"). Common examples of these three classes are shown below, with live cells shown in black, and dead cells shown in white.\nThe \"block\" and \"boat\" do not change, the \"blinker\" and \"toad\" have 2 looks that repeat, and the \"glider\" and \"lightweight spaceship\" (\"LWSS\") are spaceships which keep moving across the cells in each level. The \"pulsar\" is the most common repeat that has 3 parts. Most of the repeating patterns have 2 parts, like the blinker and toad. .\nVariations on Life.\nSince the Game of Life was made, some people play with new rules. These rules are usually more ways to make cells alive or dead, or they are more rules to make it harder for cells to switch.\nSome variations change the way the cells look or where they are put. \nTwo players.\nWhen two people play the Game of Life, the alive cells have two colors and a player wins when their colors take up all of the cells. When a dead cell becomes alive, its color is the same as the alive cells that touch it. If both colors are touching the new alive cell, then the color that touches it more wins.\nOther websites.\nMany other websites concerning the Game of Life can be found on . In addition, Game of Life News is a blog reporting on recent developments in the Game of Life by many individuals.\nSome additional links:"}

Jesus was there to set a good example (much like Adam's bad example) but also to pay the price for our sins. Pelagius believed that because people \"choose\" to sin, they are like criminals who need to be pardoned, \"not\" victims of an inherited sinful nature.\nPelagianism was condemned as heresy at the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD. However, some people believe that Pelagius was simply misunderstood.

It officially began as a church in 1954 in Seoul, South Korea. On October 12, 2009, it was announced that Sun Myung Moon was given the church to his sons, Moon Hyung-jin, Moon Kook-jin, and Moon Hyun-jin.\nControversies.\nThe Unification Church is a controversial organisation. Some people say it is a cult. For example, Sun Myung Moon's says he is the \"Savior, Messiah, Returning Lord\" and using a Senate office building for a coronation ceremony. He also said that his teachings have helped Hitler and Stalin be \"reborn as new persons\". Many countries have recognized the organisation as a religion for legal purposes. This means the Unification Church has to pay less taxes, or no taxes at all.\nSome doubt the organization's religious origins. Frederick Sontag, a professor of philosophy whose view of the church is no longer favorable studied the Unification Church for 11 months. He concluded that \"one thing is sure: the church has a genuine spiritual basis.\" A German court made a similar finding.\nSome detractors have said that the church's main purpose is to advance Moon's political aspirations, such as the formation of a one world government.\nAbuse of money.\nCritics say the church misused money. They say the church made Moon rich. The Moon family situation is described as one of \"luxury and privilege\" and as \"lavish\".\nNansook Hong lived with the Moon family for 14 years. She describes the Unification Church as \"a cash operation\". She also pointed out there have been questionable movements of money, for example: \"The Japanese had no trouble bringing the cash into the United States; they would tell customs agents that they were in America to gamble at Atlantic City. In addition, many businesses run by the church were cash operations, including several Japanese restaurants in New York City. I saw deliveries of cash from church headquarters that went directly into the wall safe in Mrs. Moon's closet.\"\nIn the 1990s, thousands of Japanese elderly people claimed to have been defrauded of their life savings by Moon followers' spiritual sales . Moon's church was the subject of the largest consumer fraud investigation in Japan's history in 1997 and number of subsequent court decisions awarded hundreds of millions of yen in judgments, including 37.6 million yen ($300,000) to pay two women coerced into donating their assets to the Unification Church.\nRecruitment and allegations of brainwashing.\nIn the United States in the 1970s, the media reported on the high-pressure recruitment methods of Unificationists and said that the church separated vulnerable college students from their families through the use of brainwashing or mind control.\nMoon dismissed these criticisms, stating in 1976 that he had received many thank-you letters from parents whose children became closer to them after joining the movement. (In 1977, Moon had a notice posted in all Unification Churches in America, mandating that all members write to their families no less than once every 10 days.)\nMoon and his wife were banned from entry into Germany and the other 14 Schengen treaty countries, on the grounds that they are leaders of a sect that endangered the personal and social development of young people. The Netherlands and a few other Schengen states let Moon and his wife enter their countries in 2005. In 2006 the German Supreme Court overturned the ban.\nPolitical activities.\nCritics of the Unification Church have accused the organization of being closely involved with covert CIA-authored operations against communism in Korea during the 1960s. The Church is known to have been involved with weapon and munitions manufacturing in Korea since the 1960s, as documented in a 1978 United States Congressional Report on the Unification Church. The explanation given by Korean Unification Church members is that all manufacturers seeking to do business in South Korea were required to supply the military.\nSun Myung Moon's controversial religious and political Unification Movement, which includes not only the Unification Church but an enormous constellation of civic organizations, including the Washington Times Foundation, is allied politically with evangelical Christians such as Jerry Falwell and Tim LaHaye. Advocates adhering to this point of view have challenged the church's tax-exempt status in the US, arguing that the political activities of church-related groups comprise an impermissible intrusion of the church into political areas.\nRev. Moon's infidelity.\nIn her 1998 book \"In the Shadow of the Moons: My Life in the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Family\", Nansook Hong, ex-wife of Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han's eldest son Hyo Jin Moon said that both Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han told her about Sun Myung Moon's extramarital affairs (which she said he called \"providential affairs\"), including one which resulted in the birth of a boy raised by a church leader, named by Sun Myung Moon's daughter Un Jin Moon on the news show \"60 Minutes\".\nIn 1993, Chung Hwa Pak released the book \"Roku Maria no Higeki\" (\"Tragedy of the Six Marys\") through the Koyu Publishing Co. of Japan. The book contained allegations that Moon conducted sex rituals amongst six married female disciples (\"The Six Marys\") who were to have prepared the way for the virgin who would marry Moon and become the True Mother. Chung Hwa Pak had left the movement when the book was published and later withdrew the book from print when he rejoined the Unification Church. Before his death Chung Hwa Pak published a second book, \"The Apostate\", and recanted all allegations made in \"Roku Maria no Higeki\".\nSouth America.\nAuthorities in Brazil and Paraguay have expressed concerns over the Church's purchases in recent years of large tracts of land in South America, ranging in the hundreds of thousands of acres.\nIn May 2002, federal police in Brazil conducted a number of raids on organizations linked to Sun Myung Moon. In a statement, the police stated that the raids were part of a broad investigation into allegations of tax evasion and immigration violations by Moon's organization. The Association of Families for Unification and World Peace was the target of the raids, which took place in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, and the personal residence of Moon's primary representative in Brazil, Reverend Kim Yoon-sang. As of 2008 no legal action has been taken by the Brazilian government resulting from their investigations.\nAnti-gay teachings.\nMoon has spoken vehemently against homosexual activity. In talks to church members he compared homosexuals to \"dirty dung-eating dogs\" and prophesied that \"gays will be eliminated\" in a \"purge on God's orders\". These statements were criticized by gay rights groups.\nB. A. Robinson of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance wrote:"}

Salsa music is based on Cuban music. This is a \"fusion\" of musical ideas which originally came from Africa and Spain.\nDuring 1965-1975 in New York, musicians of Cuban and Puerto Rican origin combined to produce this Cuban-style music. The music got the label of 'salsa'. No-one really knows how this happened, but everyone recognised how good it was to have a label for it. Over time, salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late 60s Willie Colon developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms. N.Y. radio programmes offered 'salsarengue' as a further combination.\nThe question of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be heard. Later it became clear that salsa in New York was a bit different from popular music in Cuba. Also, Miami, Venezuela, Colombia and other places all had their own ideas. It now seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s, at any rate in New York. The reasons for this are also much disputed. It is difficult for any music which uses a foreign language to succeed in the biggest English-speaking market-place.\nSalsa as a dance can be seen in all the places mentioned. Unlike standard ballroom dancing, there is no clear agreement on how it should be danced, and the methods differ widely in detail. The teaching of salsa is also rather undeveloped. But, as a general guide, salsa dancing is rather like other dances from Cuba, such as the cha-cha-cha."}

Because \"Tar\u014d\" is a common Japanese boy's name, it is usually translated as \"Peach Boy\". \"Momotar\u014d\" is also the name of several books, films, and other works that tell the tale of this hero.\nThe most common version of this tale (from the Edo Period), tells Momotar\u014d came to earth inside a giant peach. The peach was found floating down a river by an old woman without children who was washing clothes there. The woman and her husband found the child when they tried to open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been sent by Heaven to be their son. The couple called him Momotar\u014d, from \"momo\" (peach) and \"tar\u014d\" (oldest son in the family).\nAn older version of the story tells the old woman discover the giant, floating peach and take it home with her, as she finds it to be of good color and looking tasty. After eating a piece of the peach, the old woman is and becomes young and beautiful again. When her old husband comes home from the hills, he is surprised to find a lovely young lady in his house. At first he does not even recognize his own wife in her new form, but she explains what happened to him. She then gives her husband a piece of the peach to eat, and he also becomes young again. That night, the couple makes love, and the woman becomes pregnant as a result. She later gives birth to their first child, a son, whom they name \"Tar\u014d\", as that is a common Japanese name for a first son. This version of the story is the oldest one that is written in old texts, but it appears to have been changed with the version without sex in school textbooks of the Meiji period. The peach is often seen as a symbol of sex or in Japan, because its fruit is believed to be similar to a woman's buttocks.\nYears later, Momotar\u014d left his parents for an island called Onigashima to destroy the evil oni (demons or ogres) that lived there. On his way, Momotar\u014d met and became friends with a talking dog, monkey, and pheasant, who agreed to help him in his mission. At the island, Momotar\u014d and his animal friends entered the demons' fort and beat the demons' leader, Ura, and his army. Momotar\u014d returned home with his new friends, and his family lived happily from then on."}

Amaterasu became so scared of his wrath that she went to hide into a cave, Ame-no-Iwato (\u5929\u306e\u5ca9\u6238). The world, without the light of the sun, became dark. The Oni (devils of Japanese mythology) came out to the dark world, and the gods could not make Amaterasu come out of the cave.\nThe intelligent Uzume took a small boat, turned it upside down near the cave entrance, and began a dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other Kami. They thought this was so funny that they laughed happily.\nAmaterasu heard them, and looked out to see why the gods were laughing. When she opened the cave, she saw her wonderful reflection in a mirror Uzume had put on a tree, and slowly came out of the cave.\nAt that moment, the god Ameno-Tajikarawo (\u5929\u624b\u529b\u7537\u547d) closed the cave behind her, so she could not go back in. Another god tied a magic rope across the entrance. The sun goddess was then asked by the Kami Ame-no-Koyane (\u5929\u5150\u5c4b\u6839\u547d) to go back with the gods. She agreed, and light came back to the earth.\nUzume is still worshipped today as a Shinto kami. She is also known as Ame-no-Uzume, \"The Great Persuader\", and \"The Heavenly Alarming Female\"."}

All three were created from Izanagi, when he washed his face to clean the dirtiness of Yomi, the underworld. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye, and Susano'o from the washing of the nose.\nThe tales tell of great between Susano'o and his sister. When he was to leave Heaven forever because Izanagi ordered him to, he went to say goodbye to his sister. Amaterasu, suspicious, proposed him a challenge: each of them was to turn an object of the other's into people. Amaterasu created three women from Susano'o's sword while he created five men from her necklace. Amaterasu said the men were hers because they were born of her necklace. Susano'o destroyed her rice fields, threw a dead pony into her loom, and killed one of her assistants in anger. For this, Amaterasu, sad, angry and scared, went to hide inside Ama-no-Iwato, the \"heavenly rock cave\", so the Sun was hidden and the world became dark for a long time.\nAmaterasu later was made to come out of the cave, but Susano'o was punished by being banished from Heaven. He came down to the province of Izumo, where he met an old couple. Seven of their eight daughters had been eaten by the eight-headed serpent Yamata-no-Orochi and it was about to come for the eighth, Kushi-inada-hime. After the couple promised their daughter's hand in marriage to Susano'o, he agreed to kill Orochi. With the help of eight bowls of \"sake\" (one for each head), Susano'o cut the head off the monster when it was sleeping.\nFrom one of Orochi's tails, Susano'o took out a sword, which he called \"Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi\" (\"Heaven's Cloud-Gathering Sword\"), later known as the \"Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi\". The sword was given to Amaterasu as a gift and was later given to her descendant Ninigi (the great-grandfather of Emperor Jimmu), with the \"Yata-no-Kagami\" (a mirror) and \"magatama\" (sacred jewels) as proof of his divine right to rule on Earth (the three Imperial Regalia of Japan).\nIzumo.\nAmaterasu's shrine is at Ise Shrine, and Susano'o's is in Izumo, where he came down to Earth when banished from heaven.

His early life is a mystery. Kaspar appeared in the street in 1828, not able to talk normally, and no one knew where he had come from.\nDiscovery.\nOn May 26 1828 the boy who became known as Kaspar Hauser was found in the streets of Nuremberg, Germany. He was dressed like a simple country person and could hardly talk. He carried with him two letters. One letter seems to have been written by a poor workman and it was addressed to a captain in the army. The writer of the letter says that he had looked after the boy since 1812 and that the boy wants to serve the king in the army. He asks the captain to take the boy or to hang him. There is no date on the letter. The other letter looked as if it was from his mother to the poor workman who had been looking after him. It says that the child was born on April 30th 1812 and that he was called Kaspar but that he has no second name. It says that his father was a soldier and that the boy should become a soldier when he is 17. The mother writes that she herself is too poor to look after him.\nThe boy was taken to an army captain whose name was Wessenig. The only things Kaspar could say (in German) were: \"I want to be a knight, as my father was,\" and \"Horse! Horse!\" The captain asked him lots of other questions but the boy only cried and said \"Don't know.\" He was taken to a police station where he could only write his name: Kaspar Hauser.\nEarly Life.\nHe spent the next two months in a tower where a jailor looked after him. Many people came to see him. He smiled, and he walked like a baby. He was probably 16 years old, but his thinking was like a small child, and he would only drink water and eat bread.\nIt took a long time, but Kaspar was taught to speak, and slowly told people about his life. He said that he had spent his life locked up in a small room with only a straw bed to sleep in and a wooden horse to play with. He was only given bread and water. Sometimes the water tasted strange because it had something inside that made him go to sleep. When he woke up from such a sleep he found that his hair and fingernails had been cut. Later he was visited by a man who never showed his face. The man taught him to speak a little bit, and then let him go. Kaspar walked down the streets of Nuremburg and then fainted. \nPeople in many countries heard about the mysterious boy and tried to find out who he was. Some people thought he was related to the Grand Duke of Baden. Some people thought it was all a big joke.\nHauser was then taken into care by a schoolteacher, Friedrich Daumer, who taught him to speak, read and write. Kaspar learned quickly.\nAttempted Murder.\nOn October 17 1829, a hooded man tried to kill Hauser with a large knife but managed only to wound his forehead. People were worried that the person might try to kill him again, so he was given to someone else to be looked after. He was given a job as a copyist. Because someone had tried to murder him some people thought it proved that he was related to a noble family in the house of Baden.\nLord Stanhope.\nA British nobleman, Lord Stanhope, was interested in Hauser and gave him presents and tried to get permission to look after him. He said that Hauser was Hungarian and not of noble blood. Many historians thought that Lord Stanhope himself might have been from the house of Baden and that was why he was interested in Kaspar.\nDeath.\nOn 14 December 1833, Hauser was told to go to a garden where he would find out about the family he came from. When he got there he was attacked by a stranger who stabbed him in the chest. He managed to get home but died three days later. No one knew who had murdered him, although a strange note was found in a black purse saying that Kaspar would not be able to tell people who had killed him, but that he was from the Bavarian border and that his initials were ML\u00d6.\" No one ever found out who the murderer was, and no one ever found out who Kaspar was.\nPopular Media.\nThe story of Kaspar Hauser has been made into movies, both in German and in English. Books have been written about him and lots of people have made guesses about who he might have been. Some people have even guessed that he was just pretending, but it seems unlikely that he could have kept that up for several years."}

This is true in expressions such as \"obscene profits\" or \"the obscenity of war\". It can simply be used to mean profanity, or it can mean anything that is taboo, indecent, abhorrent, or disgusting.\nThe definition of what is thought of as obscene depends on the culture. Different communities and individuals may have different ideas of what is obscene and what is not. The definition of what is considered obscene also changes with time. Things that were obscene at one time no longer are at another.\nMany cultures have made laws to define what is considered to be obscene. Censorship is often used to try to suppress or control materials that are obscene under these definitions. These usually include pornographic material."}

{"id": "68686", "revid": "1063883", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68686", "title": "Diocletian", "text": "Diocletian (Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus, about 245 to about 312) was Roman Emperor from 20 November 284 to 11 May 305. He was born in Dalmatia of poor parents. Diocletian ended the period known as the Crisis of the Third Century (235\u2013284). He worked to return Rome to its former glory by making changes in key areas.\nReligion: He persecuted Christians, crucifying more than any other emperor. He imposed the traditional polytheistic religion of the Romans.\nEconomy: Recognizing a gold drain from the western Mediterranean to the east, he tried to stop the inflation of the region by legislation. This did not work. He decreed that coins could only be made of gold or silver, stopping the trend of using lead in their creation. He made the tax system work better.\nMilitary: Diocletian changed the army from the traditional garrison defense. He put small outposts of soldiers on the border. He got local soldiers from the border regions along the Rhine and Danube rivers. These soldiers farmed and lived with their families in a village atmosphere. They lit signal fires on signal towers to warn other outposts of possible invasion by Germans from across the border. These outpost soldiers got regular pay from Rome for their services. He allowed soldiers to move up through the ranks by \"military credits\" earned by years of loyal service and by actions on the field of battle.\nPolitical structure.\nDiocletian established a form of government known as the tetrarchy. In this, the Empire was organised into four parts, each ruled by a co-emperor. Diocletian took charge of the eastern empire. The senior co-emperor was Maximian Augustus, a fellow officer. He took charge of the western empire. Later, two junior co-emperors were added: Galerius and Constantius Chlorus.\nFinally, in 305, the two senior emperors abdicated and retired, and the two juniors rose to the rank of \"Augustus\". They in turn were supported by two juniors: Severus II in the west under Constantius, and Maximinus in the east under Galerius. In this way, the Tetrarchy showed how it could reproduce itself.\nIllyria.\nThese men were from the Roman province of Illyria, several in the city of Sirmium, which would become one of the four capitals under this system. From the time of Domitian (81\u201396), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian provinces had been the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions.\nIn the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians came to dominate the army's senior officer echelons. Ultimately, the Illyrian officer class seized control of the state itself.\nRegions and capitals.\nThe four Tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire. They faced Persia and the Germanic tribes. Also, there were many tribes from the eastern steppe which presented at the Rhine and Danube.\nThe four centres are known as the 'Tetrarchic capitals'. Although Rome ceased to be the operational capital, it was still the nominal capital of the entire empire. It had its own Prefect of the City, an idea later copied in Constantinople. The four Tetrarchic capitals were:\nAquileia, a port on the Adriatic coast, and Eboracum (modern York, in northern England near the Scottish tribes), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.\nIn terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division between the four Tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a 'war theatre'. Each Tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective Praetorian Prefect, each supervising several Vicarii, the governors-general in charge of another new administrative level, the civil diocese. \nFor a listing of the provinces, now known as eparchy, within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see Roman province.\nIn the West, the \"Augustus\" Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his \"Caesar\", Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the \"Augustus\" Diocletian and his \"Caesar\", Galerius, were much more flexible.\nRetirement and death.\nDiocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government, and stabilized the empire economically and militarily. This helped the empire to remain intact for another hundred years, despite having seemed near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth.\nWeakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate the position. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split.\nMaximian attempted to return to power. Diocletian ordered him to step down permanently. Finally, Maximian was forced to commit suicide and the tetrarchy began to unravel . Diocletian despaired and died in 311, possibly of suicide."}

He rose to prominence during the reign of emperor Domitian.\nServing as a general in the Roman army along the German frontier, Trajan successfully put down the revolt of Antonius Saturninus in 89 AD.\nIn September 96 AD, Domitian was succeeded by Nerva, an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power, a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard compelled him to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. Nerva died on 27 January 98 AD, and was succeeded by Trajan without incident.\nTrajan as Emperor.\nAs a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program which reshaped the city of Rome and left multiple enduring landmarks such as Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column.\nEarly in his reign he annexed Nabataea (between the Arabian and Sinai peninsulas), creating the province of Arabia Petraea. His conquest of Dacia enriched the empire greatly because the new province possessed many valuable gold mines. The territory he conquered and later populated with roman colonists (actually called Romania) is the only one still romance speaking in our days in eastern Europe.\nHis war against the Parthian Empire ended with the sack of its capital Ctesiphon and the annexation of Armenia and Mesopotamia. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent. He also created in 116 AD a \"client state\" in Parthia (actual Iran). After these conquests Trajan sailed on the Persian Gulf complaining that he was too much old to invade India, as did Alexander the Great.\nIn late 117 AD, while sailing back to Rome from the conquered Mesopotamia, Trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in the city of Selinus. He was deified by the Senate, and succeeded by his adopted son Hadrian.\nAs an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured\u00a0\u2014 he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries. Every new emperor after him was honoured by the Senate with the prayer \"felicior Augusto, melior Traiano\", meaning \"may he be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan\".\nAmong medieval Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a \"virtuous pagan\", while the 18th century historian Edward Gibbon popularized the notion of the Five Good Emperors, of which Trajan was the second."}

Their place of residence was the subject of much dispute: according to both Herodotus and Strabo, these warrior women lived on the banks of the river Thermodon, by the Black Sea, while Diodorus states that, prior to the ones by the Black Sea, there lived a different tribe of Amazons in the region of Libya. The Amazons were said to have founded several cities and temples found in Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons were the ones who invented the cavalry."}

Sapphires are the same as rubies, except that they are not red.\nSapphire can be found in the ground or it can be made in large crystal. Blue sapphires are the most famous kind, but they can be many different colors, like amber and orange. \nSapphires have a long history. Tradition says that the tablets of the Ten Commandments were made of sapphire, so strong a hammer could not break them, and would break instead if it hit them. The ancient Persians believed that the earth sat on a big sapphire and that the big sapphire made the sky blue.\nA lot of ancient people thought rubies made people calm down, as well as cure their bruises.\nSapphires have been used by kings and queens for a long time as a symbol of luck, virtue, wisdom, and holiness. Princess Diana and Princess Anne both received sapphire engagement rings and the British Crown Jewels are full of large blue sapphires, the symbol of kind and wise rulers.\nSapphires represent September. It symbolizes telling the truth and doing what you said you would.\nSapphire is actually just corundum and is one of the hardest minerals on the hardness scale. Since sapphire is the second hardest mineral in the hardness scale, it is sometimes used as a polishing tool. \nThis mineral is found in gem gravel deposits. These deposits are formed from the heat of metamorphic or igneous rock plateaus. The places where sapphire is formed abundantly are Myanmar, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka. The most costly and beautiful sapphires are shipped from Kashmir, India. In other words, sapphire is mostly found in Asia. Recent findings of sapphire have taken place in Australia, Kenya, and Tanzania. \nSapphire was the first mineral to be lab grown in a strategy called \"flame fusion\". Another strategy, slightly harder to use, \"flux growth\" was used to lab grow sapphire.\nHeating yellow, light yellow, or colorless sapphire from 1500-1900oc can turn into a dark yellow, gold, golden brown, orange, or a reddish brown colored sapphire. There is a specific kind of sapphire called Star sapphires have whitish pieces of rutile or silk as some call it.

It was created by Endemol Netherlands. The program was first aired on June 11, 2001.\nAbout the show.\nThe original Dutch version of the program was called \"Now or Neverland\". When Endemol USA and NBC changed it to be shown in America in 2001, they changed the name to \"Fear Factor\". \"Fear Factor\" has many different versions which are shown in different countries.\nThe program has contestants compete against each other in a series of stunts. The person who finishes better and/or quicker than all the other contestants gets a prize of US$50,000. For the first five years the program was made, the contestants were usually three men and three women. Each person played for themselves. In the sixth year, the show changed. They started using four teams of two people. The members of each team had some relationship with one another, for example Father-daughter, Husband-wife, or friends. Each team played for a shared prize of the same amount. \"Fear Factor\" is hosted by comedian Joe Rogan and executive produced by Matt Kunitz. The main music for the program is composed and written by Russ Landau. Other music used on the show is made from rhythmic themes most notably taken from the popular game \"Half-Life\".\n\"Fear Factor\" was an attempt by NBC to compete with the successful series, \"Survivor\". The program was very popular for the network in the summer of 2001. It had strong ratings for the next couple of years, but in later years, the ratings were not as good. In 2006, \"Fear Factor\" was being shown at the same time as TV ratings champion, the Fox talent series \"American Idol\" on Tuesday nights. It did not get good ratings during this time. During the sixth season, NBC decided to not show the program for the rest of the year to make room for the sitcom \"Joey\". That series was only shown for a few weeks. NBC canceled \"Fear Factor\" in May of 2006. The network began showing the remaining episodes of the sixth season on June 13, 2006. These episodes were shown throughout the summer. In 2004, \"Fear Factor\" became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, \"Fear Factor\" earned NBC a reported $600 million from selling advertising during the program.\nOn May 31, 2011, NBC announced that \"Fear Factor\" would be revived for a new season. Eight episodes, two of which were 30 minutes long, were ordered. Rogan returned as host of the show. The revival began on December 12, 2011. On May 13, 2012, NBC announced the cancellation of the show. The last episode aired on July 16, 2012."}

There are two general types, traditional fluorescent and compact fluorescent. This article is about traditional (straight tube shaped) fluorescent lamps.\nThe purchase price of a fluorescent lamp is often much higher than an incandescent lamp of the same output, and the light from fluorescent lamps looks different to light from incandescent lamps. Fluorescent lamps have a longer rated life and use less energy than an incandescent lamp of the same brightness. A fluorescent lamp can save over US$30 in electricity costs over the lamp\u2019s lifetime compared to an incandescent lamp.\nHow it works.\nAn electric current is applied to mercury vapor inside the tube, causing it to emit ultraviolet (UV) light. A phosphor on the walls of the tube absorbs the ultraviolet light. This causes an electron to jump up to an orbital with a higher energy. When the electron drops back down to its normal orbital, the phosphor re-emits its energy as visible light.\nThe ballast.\nThe ballast prevents too much electricity from flowing through the tube. It also starts the lamp with a high voltage for a split second when it is switched on. The ballast is located inside the fixture in traditional fluorescent tube fixtures. In compact fluorescent bulbs the ballast is in or near the base of the bulb. There are two types of ballasts, magnetic and electronic. Magnetic ballasts have mostly fallen out of use, as they are less efficient than electronic ballasts, they cause the bulb to flicker, and they do not start instantly. Electronic ballasts were at one time more expensive than magnetic ballasts, but now the price is about the same.\nLifespan.\nThe average rated life of a fluorescent light bulb is 8 to 15 times longer that of incandescent light bulbs. Fluorescent light bulbs typically have a rated lifespan of 7,000 to 15,000 hours, whereas incandescent lamps are usually manufactured to have a lifespan of 750 hours or 1,000 hours.\nThe lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors, including operating voltage, manufacturing defects, exposure to voltage spikes, mechanical shock, frequency of cycling on and off, lamp orientation, and ambient operating temperature. The life of a fluorescent lamp is significantly shorter if it is turned on and off frequently. In the case of a 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan of a fluorescent lamp can be reduced to \"close to that of incandescent light bulbs\". The U.S. Energy Star program suggests that fluorescent lamps be left on when leaving a room for less than 15 minutes so that this problem does not happen. If the light must be switched on and off often, Cold cathode fluorescent lamps can be used. Cold cathode fluorescent lamps are designed for many more on/off cycles than standard lamps.\nMercury content and recycling.\nThe mercury inside the tube is toxic and makes these bulbs hazardous waste. The bulbs must be taken to a recycling center after they stop working. During normal use, the mercury cannot escape, although it will escape if the bulb is broken. If a single bulb breaks, it is not usually a problem. It is recommended to open windows to air out the room, and to clean up broken glass with duct tape instead of a vacuum cleaner.\nAlternatives.\nMany people and businesses do not want to use fluorescent lamps due to their mercury content. Halogen, LED, and traditional incandescent bulbs are possible alternatives.\nLED tubes can be installed in fluorescent tube fixtures, but sometimes an electrician needs to rewire the fixture first to remove the ballast."}

It was also the third named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. The stormed formed from a non-tropical system between Bermuda on Cape Cod, Massachusetts that developed on July 31 with good conditions for further development. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and began to move quickly northeastwards into colder water temperatures. When convection began to decrease, the National Hurricane Center stopped sending out advisories on August 1 when Chantal began to turn into an extratropical cyclone. Later, the remnants moved over southeast Newfoundland, before moving into the Arctic Ocean.\nStorm history.\nAn area of thunderstorm activity developed on July 28 about 100\u00a0miles (160\u00a0km) east of the Bahamas which was associated with a weak low pressure system. It moved north-northeastward, into poor environmental conditions which left the system disorganized. However, conditions then were forecasted to become better for development, and by July 29 the National Hurricane Center stated that it had \"potential for tropical or subtropical development.\" On July 30, the low passed to the west of Bermuda as it continued moving northeastward, under the effects of a large mid-latitude trough. The system contained an exposed low-level circulation, which from time to time passed under a thick area of convection to its northeast. By early on July 31, ship reports and QuikSCAT observations detected winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h), and the center was well-involved enough with the convection for the National Hurricane Center to name it as \"Tropical Depression Three\" while it was located about 270\u00a0miles (435\u00a0km) north-northwest of Bermuda, or about 445\u00a0miles (710\u00a0km) south-southeast of Chatham, Massachusetts.\nBy six hours after development, the depression had of a somewhat exposed low-level center with deep convection taking up most of the northeastern semicircle. Located over sea surface temperatures of about 80\u00ba\u00a0F (27\u00ba\u00a0C), one forecaster said the depression had \"a small window of opportunity... for it to reach tropical storm strength before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone.\" The system organized further, and based on satellite pictures and QuikSCAT data, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chantal at 1215\u00a0UTC on July 31 while located about 330\u00a0miles (530\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. By three hours later the system formed a well-defined curved banding features, and Chantal reached maximum systained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) at 40.2\u00ba\u00a0N. The storm speed up northeastward into an area of cold waters and cooler air, and early on August 1 the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on Chantal as it began extratropical transition.\nAfter becoming an extratropical cyclone, Chantal managed to keep scattered convection near its center, though its main area of convection and clouds moved to its north. On August 1, the cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, and by late in the day the extratropical remnants of Chantal were about 265\u00a0miles (425\u00a0km) northeast of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and moving northeastward at 44\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h).\nImpact.\nThe weather system that would later become Chantal began to affect Bermuda on July 30. It caused some thunderstorms. The next day, it caused heavy rainfall that reached r2.12\u00a0inches (53.8\u00a0mm) at the Bermuda International Airport. Winds on the island reached 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) because of the weather system. After Chantal passed Bermuda, a ship with the call sign of \"C60Y4\" recorded winds of 37\u00a0mph (59\u00a0km/h).\nShortly after the system became a tropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center of Canada sent out gale warnings for the waters off of Newfoundland. The Newfoundland Labrador Weather Office also issued warnings for heavy rain.\nIn the open ocean, waves from Chantal reached 20\u00a0feet (6\u00a0m) high. The storm also had effects on land. A wind gust of 54\u00a0mph (88\u00a0km/h) was reported. What was left of Chantal caused heavy rainfall in a short time in Newfoundland. In the province, rainfall peaked at 5.9\u00a0inches (150\u00a0mm) at Whitbourne. The rainfall caused flooding and also caused streets to wash out in several cities on the Avalon Peninsula. Several towns declared states of emergencies along the Avalon Peninsula."}

It is on the corner of Flinders and Swanston Streets next to the Yarra River in the middle of the city, stretching from Swanston Street to Queen Street and covering two city blocks. Each weekday, about 105,000 people and 1,500 trains use the station.\nIt is serviced by Metro's suburban and city loop services, and V/Line's regional services.\nHistory.\nThe first railway station in the Flinders Street site was called Melbourne or City Terminus, and was a collection of sheds. It was completed in 1854 and was officially opened on 12 September by Sir Charles Hotham. The terminus was the first city railway station in Australia, and the opening day saw the first steam train trip in the country. It travelled to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), over the Sandridge Bridge (which has now been redeveloped in 2006 as a pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Yarra River), travelling along the now light rail Port Melbourne line.\nMelbourne's two other early central-city stations, Spencer Street Station (now Southern Cross Station) and Princes Bridge, opened in 1859. Princes Bridge was originally separated from Flinders Street, even though it was only on the opposite side of Swanston Street. Once the railway line was extended under the street to join the two, Princes Bridge slowly became amalgamated into Flinders Street. Federation Square now occupies its site.\nIn 1882 the government decided to build a new central passenger station to replace the existing construction. A worldwide design competition was held in 1899, with 17 entries received. The \u00a3500 first prize went to railway employees J. W. Fawcett and H. P. C. Ashworth, whose design included a giant dome and clock tower. Work began in 1901 and ended in 1910.\nPlatforms.\nFlinders Street Station's platforms are numbered from north to south, with Platform No. 1 being the farthest north, and generally serve specific lines as follows.\nPlatform 1: South Morangand Hurstbridge\nPlatforms 2 &amp; 3: Belgrave, Glen Waverley and Lilydale\nPlatforms 4 &amp; 5: Alamein, Blackburn trains on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines (both platform 4 only), Cragieburn, Sydenham, Upfield and Werribee\nPlatforms 6 &amp; 7: Cranbourne, Frankston and Pakenham \nPlatforms 8 &amp; 9: Sandringham and Williamstown (Peak Only)\nPlatforms 10 &amp; 12\u201314: Various services, depending on day and time.\n\"Note that the eastern end of Platform No. 1 is designated as Platform No. 14, past the Platform 1 escalators. Platform 11 is out of use and has no track.\"\nStation redevelopment.\nFlinders Street is currently undergoing redevelopment. It will involve cleaning and repair, as well as improving general ability for people who are disabled to move around the station.\nThe works include: "}

At first there were 4 members, Hayley Williams, Josh and Zac Farro and Jeremy Davis. In 2009, Taylor York joined the band. Now there are 3 members - singer Hayley Williams, drummer Zac Farro, and guitarist Taylor York. They have released five studio albums: \"All We Know Is Falling\", \"RIOT!,\" \"Brand New Eyes\", and \"Paramore, After Laughter\" and a live album: 'The Final Riot!' Their most successful album is \"RIOT!\". Their song \"Monster\" was used in 2011 for the 3rd \"Transformers\" movie. Paramore also released an EP called \"The Summer Tic\".\nHistory.\nParamore was originally formed in 2004 in Franklin, Tennessee, United States. The members then were vocalist Hayley Williams, lead guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, and bassist Jeremy Davis. Later rhythm guitarist Jason Bynum joined. The name \"Paramore\" came from the name of their first bassist's mother. When they learned the meaning of the word \"paramour\" (it means \"secret lover\"), they decided to use the name under \"Paramore\" spelling.\n2005: \"All We Know Is Falling\".\nParamore went to Orlando, Florida to start working on their first album. Shortly after, Jeremy Davis left the band for personal reasons. Hayley Williams then wrote the song \"All We Know\" about his leaving. The band later decided to work the album around that idea, about someone that left something. The album artwork also describes that concept. Hayley Williams explains, \"The couch on the cover of \"All We Know is Falling\" with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space.\" Recording took three weeks, and promotional material for the album only used the four remaining members.\nBefore starting on tour, the band added bassist John Hembree. But soon, Jeremy Davis returned to Paramore after being asked by the band to replace Hembree.\n\"All We Know Is Falling\" released on July 24, 2005. Paramore also released \"Pressure\" as their first single. The music video for that song was directed by Shane Drake. The song had failed to get into the charts. In July, they released the second single, called \"Emergency\". In the music video, Hunter Lamb was their new rhythm guitarist, replacing Jason Bynum. The music video was directed by Shane Drake again. The third single, \"All We Know\", was released with the video made with live performances and backstage footage. The album reached #30 on the \"\" Heatseekers Chart. In 2007, Hunter Lamb left the band to get married.\n2007: \"Riot!\" and other projects.\nParamore started recording their second album, called \"Riot!\" in January 2007. In the recording process, guitarist Josh Farro played all guitar parts because Hunter Lamb's had left. Then Farro's asked their old friend, Taylor York, to joined the band as rhythm guitarist for touring. They released \"Riot!\" on June 12, 2007. \"Riot!\" entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 20 and the UK charts at number 24. The album sold 44,000 copies in its first week in the United States.\nThey called the album \"Riot\" because it meant \"a sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion\". The first single from the album, \"Misery Business\", was released on June 21, 2007. Williams said, \"[the song was] more honest than anything I've ever written, and the guys matched that emotion musically.\"\nThe second single from \"Riot!\" is called \"Hallelujah\". It was released on July 30, 2007. The single is only available on UK television and online. The music video features live performances and backstage footage, just like \"All We Know\". In August, Paramore was in New Found Glory's music video for their cover of Sixpence None the Richer's song \"Kiss Me\".\nThe music video for \"Crushcrushcrush\" was released on October 11, 2007, as the third single from Riot!. The music video of \"Crushcrushcrush\" featured Paramore playing the song in a desert being spied on by some people, and later crushed their equipment. The single was released in the United States on November 19. It was available in the United Kingdom on November 12, 2007. Hayley Williams did guest vocals for the songs \"The Church Channel\" and \"Plea\" for the Say Anything's album \"In Defense of the Genre\" that released on October 23, 2007.\nEarly in February 2008, Paramore started their Europe tour. However on February 21, 2008, they said that they had canceled some shows to fix their personal issues. Williams wrote on the band's website that \"the break will give that band a chance to get away and work out our personal issues\". MTV.com reported rumors of problems had started earlier in the month when Josh Farro expressed his anger against the media's focus on Hayley Williams. In the middle of those problems, Paramore recorded the music video for \"That's What You Get\", the album's fourth single. That was released on March 24, 2008.\nOn May 19, 2008, Paramore posted on their website to say they would be going on tour named \"The Final Riot!\" from July 25 to September 1.\nThe band had 2 songs in the soundtrack of the movie \"Twilight\". Those songs are \"Decode\" and \"I Caught Myself\". \"Decode\" is the first single of the soundtrack. The band started shoot the music video in October 13. The video premiered on November 3, 2008.\nOn November 25, 2008, Paramore released a live album named \"The Final Riot!\". The album has a bonus DVD with a full concert recorded in Chicago, and a behind the scenes documentary. On 9 of April 2009, \"The Final Riot!\" was certified gold in the US.\n2009: \"Brand New Eyes\".\nParamore released their third studio album called \"Brand New Eyes\" on September 29, 2009. In this album Taylor York was already a member of Paramore. Paramore decided to named the album \"Brand New Eyes\" because it means \"seeing things from a whole new perspective\" after all the personal problems in the band. Williams said, \"Just trying to let go of whatever we might have struggled with the past and just see each other in a new way.\" They released 5 singles from this album. They are \"Ignorance\", \"Brick By Boring Brick\", \"The Only Exception\", \"Careful\", and \"Playing God\".\n2010 - 2011: Farro's departure.\nOn December 18, 2010, Paramore posted on their official website that Josh Farro and Zac Farro had officially left the band. The post stated, \"...A couple of months ago, Josh and Zac let us know they would be leaving the band after our show in Orlando last Sunday. None of us were really shocked. For the last year it hasn't seemed as if they wanted to be around anymore. We want Josh and Zac to do something that makes them happy and if that isn't here with us, then we support them finding happiness elsewhere. But we never for a second thought about leaving any of this behind...\"\nOn December 22, 2010, Josh Farro post a response on his Blogger account, telling his version about his departure. The post that Josh wrote was entirely different from the band's post. He said that the band was no more than \"a manufactured product of a major-label.\" He also blame Hayley Williams for treating the rest of the group members as her solo project.\nOn February 2, 2011, Josh Farro confirmed that he is now in the new band called Novel American.\nOn March 21, 2011, Paramore said that they were about to entering a studio in Los Angeles with producer Rob Cavallo to record their next studio-album.\n2013.\nIn January 2013, Paramore came back with a new album called \"Paramore\".\n2017.\nThey released their new album 'After Laughter'.

He was probably the best-known conductor in the world during his time. He conducted the greatest orchestras, and made many wonderful recordings. He was the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic for 35 years.\nEarly years.\nHerbert von Karajan was born in Salzburg. His name at first was Heribert Ritter von Karajan. In 1916, he went to study the piano at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. There he was told he should learn conducting. By 1929, he was conducting at the Festspielhaus, Salzburg and in 1934 he led the Vienna Philharmonic for the first time. He conducted regularly in Ulm and Aachen. \nIn 1937, Karajan first conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and the Berlin State Opera He was very successful when he conducted \"Tristan und Isolde\". In 1938 a Berlin music critic called him \"Das Wunder Karajan\" (The Karajan miracle). He started to make recordings. However, one day in June 1939 he was conducting \"Die Meistersinger\" at Bayreuth in front of Hitler and his guests the King and Queen of Yugoslavia when he suddenly could not remember the music (he was conducting without the score). The singers stopped and the curtain came down. Hitler was very angry and said that Karajan would never conduct at Bayreuth again. This event may actually have helped his career after World War II. Many people who had worked for the Nazis and for Hitler were not allowed to work.\nMarriage, and wartime career.\nDuring the war, in 1942, Karajan married Anita G\u00fctermann. She was the daughter of a rich man who had a business making sewing machines. His wife was partly Jewish. This caused the Nazi\u2019s to talk about whether Karajan should still be allowed to conduct. By 1944, he was not in favour with the Nazis, but he was still conducting in Berlin. He left Berlin and went to Milan, Italy with his wife in February 1945. Karajan divorced Anita in 1958.\nAlthough he was deposed after the war because of his Nazi connections, he started to conduct again in 1946.\nAfter the war.\nKarajan gave his first concert after the war in 1946 in Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic. He was banned again by the occupying Russians, but started conducting again the next year. \nKarajan gave many concerts with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra for the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Vienna. He conducted at La Scala in Milan for the 1948-49 season. From 1947, he made many recordings with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London and the Vienna Philharmonic in Vienna.\nIn 1951 and 1952, he conducted again at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus where he changed the seating plan for the orchestra that had been compulsory since Wagner made it in 1876.\nIn 1955, after the death of Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, he was made artistic director (conductor) for life of the Berlin Philharmonic. From 1957 to 1964 he was artistic director of the Vienna State Opera.\nHe very often conducted the Vienna Philharmonic and gave many concerts at the Salzburg Festival. He continued to work very hard performing, conducting, and recording until his death in 1989. In Karajan's last years he left the Berlin Philharmonic after arguments with them, and concentrated on working again with the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic.\nHis fame and personality.\nHerbert von Karajan had very good musicianship and memory. He conducted without a score in front of him, very often with his eyes closed. He is remembered for being very strict (like a dictator) and always insisting on having things the way he wanted. There are many stories about him that show this. He insisted on being paid very high fees. When he was being filmed conducting an orchestra, he wanted the cameras to show him all the time. When he conducted Wagner at the Metropolitan Opera, he made the stand for the conductor higher so that the audience could see him."}

Many concerts are given in the Maltings. Every year the Aldeburgh Festival has many of its concerts there. The composer Benjamin Britten used to live in Aldeburgh with the singer Peter Pears. They started a music school for young people. The Britten-Pears Foundation still continues today, with many concerts based in the Maltings. This foundation gives young musicians a chance to learn from famous music teachers and perform at concerts. Many of them have recently graduated from a music college.\nThe buildings on the site are mostly from the 19th century. They are built on the banks of the River Ore. Originally they were built to make barley and beer. When the barley had been malted it used to be sent to London and exported to Europe. The Maltings closed during the 1960s. Since then the buildings have been restored and rebuilt to include the famous concert hall. It was opened in 1967, burnt down in 1969, and rebuilt in 1970. \nThe Holst Library is connected to the Maltings and is named in honour of Imogen Holst, the daughter of Gustav Holst, who was a close friend of Benjamin Britten and an artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival from 1956 to 1977.\nThe concert hall is a place for concerts and many other community activities during the year.

Because there are three variables, it can be written in three ways, depending on which variable is placed on the left of the equals sign:\nWhere I is the current in amperes, \"V\" is the potential difference in volts, and \"R\" is a constant, measured in ohms, called the resistance.\nCurrent, Voltage, and Resistance.\nVoltage.\nVoltage is how much energy is between two points on a circuit. These two points have different charges, one is higher and the other is lower. The difference between these two points of the charge is how we measure the voltage. The unit of \u201cvolt\u201d is the name of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who created the first chemical battery. \u00a0The letter \u201cV\u201d represents voltage.\nCurrent.\nCurrent is how fast the charge is flowing. The higher the charge, the faster the current. Current has to do with electrons flowing in a circuit. Current measures how fast the electrons go. The unit of the current is \u201campere,\u201d (often referred to as \u201camps\u201d). The letter \u201cI\u201d is usually used to represent current, from the French \"intensit\u00e9 du courant\", (current intensity).\nResistance.\nResistance is how much the circuit resists the flow of the charge. This makes sure the charge does not flow too fast and damage the components. In a circuit, a light bulb can be a resistor. If electrons flow through the light bulb, then the light bulb will light up. If the resistance is high, then the lamp will be dimmer. The unit of resistance is \u201c\u03a9\u201d, \u00a0which is called omega, and pronounced \u201cohm\u201d, it is the name of the inventor of Ohm\u2019s law.\nHow Current, Voltage, and Resistance are related.\nCurrent, Voltage, and Resistance are related, which is called \u201cOhm\u2019s law\u201d. The unit of resistance (also named an \"Ohm\"), is defined so that \u201c1 Ohm\u201d as the resistance between two points in a conductor where the application of 1 volt will push 1 ampere, or 6.241\u00d710^18 electrons, through. This takes energy, which (depending on the component which the charge is flowing through) is usually lost as heat. \nFind all values in the circuit.\nFor example, a scientist knows that the value of the voltage is 20V. Resistance is known, which is in the light bulb, is 10 \u03a9. Now we need to find the other unknown variable, which is current. The Ohm\u2019s law formula can be used to solve it. With the two known variables, V(voltage) and R(resistance), the only variable left to find is I(current).\n20V= 10\u03a9 * I\nI = 2A\nIn a problem, a scientist always gets enough information to solve the other values, the only thing a scientist has to memorize is the Ohm\u2019s law formula. Then it is used with what is given to solve the unknown part. In the example above, the current is 2 amps. "}

It comes from the name the Japanese gave to a typhoon that destroyed the Mongol ships in the 13th century and saved the country from invasion. In Western culture, the word \"kamikaze\" is used to mean the suicide pilots of the Empire of Japan. Those pilots attacked the ships of the Allied Powers in the final years of World War II, during which they flew their planes into enemy ships. It has also come to mean other kinds of suicide attacks.\nMost people in Western culture believe the word \"kamikaze\" was the name used by the Japanese military for pilots, but that is not true. Their correct name was \"tokubetsu k\u014dgeki tai\" (\u7279\u5225\u653b\u6483\u968a), which literally means \"special attack team.\" This is usually abbreviated \"tokk\u014dtai\" (\u7279\u653b\u968a) in a shortened form. The suicide attacks made by Navy pilots were called \"shinp\u016b tokubetsu k\u014dgeki tai\" (\u795e\u98a8\u7279\u5225\u653b\u6483\u968a, \"divine wind special attack team\"). The American translators used a different style of pronunciation of the Japanese language by mistake, and read the word \"shinp\u016b\" (\"divine wind\") as \"kamikaze\", as those Japanese characters can be read both ways. The name became so well known after the war that Japanese also started using it.\nHistory.\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Navy and its Air force were defeated in several important battles, like Midway and the Philippine Sea. They lost many ships (including nearly all the Japanese aircraft carriers), hundreds of fighter aircraft, and many of their best pilots. The Japanese industry was small and very poor compared to the American industry. For this reason, the United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly; but Japan could only make few, and of poor quality. During 1943-44, the Allied forces were moving towards Japan. At the Battle of the Philippine Sea, on June 19-20, 1944, the Japanese forces were pushed back to the Philippines.\nOn July 15, Saipan (in the Northern Mariana Islands) was captured by Allied forces. The capture of Saipan made it possible for the United States Army Air Force to attack Japan itself, using B-29 Superfortress bombers. After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese commanders knew that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines next. The Philippines were very important because they were located between the oil fields of Southeast Asia and Japan. If Japan lost control over the Philippines, they would have little fuel left for their ships. On October 17, the Allies started the attack on the Philippines in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\nVice Admiral Takijiro Onishi was in charge of the Japanese Air Force in Manila. He understood that it was impossible to win the battle with so few aircraft and trained pilots. For this reason, he decided to form a suicide attack force, the Special Attack Unit. A group of 24 student pilots volunteered for the mission. The Special Attack force was organized into 4 groups, \"Unit Shikishima\", \"Unit Yamato\", \"Unit Asahi\", and \"Unit Yamazakura\". These names were taken from a patriotic poem (\"waka\" or \"tanka\"), written by the Japanese classical poet, Motoori Norinaga: (\u6577\u5cf6\u306e \u5927\u548c\u5fc3\u3092 \u4eba\u554f\u306f\u3070 \u671d\u65e5\u306b\u5302\u3046 \u5c71\u685c\u82b1). The poem reads: \"\"Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni niou yamazakura bana\"\nThe Japanese were defeated at the battle of Leyte Gulf, but the Special Attack force had great success. The first \"kamikaze\" attack took place on October 21, 1944, against the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy, HMAS \"Australia\". 30 sailors died in the attack, including its Captain Emile Dechaineux, and many more were wounded. By October 26, 47 more Allied ships had been attacked. Most of them were badly damaged or sunk, like the United States aircraft carrier USS \"St. Lo\".\nThis early success convinced the Japanese commanders to continue the \"kamikaze\" attacks. Many more pilots were recruited to act as \"kamikaze\". Over the next few months, more than 2,000 planes made such attacks. When the Japanese stock of airplanes began to run low, new models of low quality were built for these missions. Some of them, like the Nakajima Ki-115 \"Tsurugi\", were made mostly of wood and used stocks of older engines. The plane's landing gear was usually dropped by the pilot after takeoff so it could be used by other aircraft, because he would not be landing again. Similar suicide attack programs were planned, including rocket bombs with pilots (called \"Ohka\") and submarine torpedoes (\"Kaiten\").\nThe high point of \"kamikaze\" attacks came from April 6 to May 25, 1945 during the Battle of Okinawa, in \"Operation Kikusui\" (\"floating chrysanthemums\"). In that time, seven important waves of attacks took place, with more than 1,500 \"kamikaze\" planes. Because their training had been too short and their airplanes were poorly made, \"kamikaze\" pilots were easy targets for the experienced Allied pilots, who also had much better planes. But still, the \"kamikaze\" who escaped the anti-aircraft fire and the enemy fighter airplanes did great damage to the Allied fleet. The Allies won the battle, but they lost many ships and men because of \"kamikaze\" attacks. By the end of the battle, at least 21 American ships had been sunk by \"kamikazes\". Some ships from other Allied navies were also sunk, and dozens more were damaged.\nHundreds of extra \"kamikaze\" planes were ready to defend Japan from invasion. However, with Japan's surrender on August 15 after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the declaration of war by the Soviet Union, they were never used again.\nEffects.\nThe most important effect of the attacks was creating fear among the Allied troops. When the American ships went to the last battles, the crews were very afraid of \"kamikaze\" pilots. By the end of World War II, the Japanese Navy had sacrificed 2,525 \"kamikaze\" pilots, and the Air force had lost 1,387. The Japanese government said, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195. They also claimed that the \"kamikaze\" attacks were the cause of 80% of Allied deaths in the last years of the War.\nThe American sources claim that \"kamikaze\" sunk less ships than the Japanese say. But still, they agree that they did very important damage. According to a U.S. Air Force source, the \"kamikaze\" attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. In a 2010 book, the historian Robin Rielly said that about 60 U.S. ships were sunk by kamikazes, and over 400 were damaged by them.\nKamikaze beliefs.\nMany \"kamikaze\" pilots offered themselves as volunteers for the mission. They were usually very young, between 18 and 24 years old. Their belief was that dying when striking the enemies of Japan and the Emperor down was a very honorable death. This principle was traditional since the days of the samurai, and gave great importance to the sense of duty and obedience. This idea was called \"Giri\" (\"Obligation\"), and was part of the code of conduct of the Japanese warriors since the Middle Ages, the \"Bushido\". Many young men sacrificed themselves by their free will because these beliefs and their love for the home land were the most important things for them. The \"tokk\u014dtai\" pilot's manual told pilots to never close their eyes. This was because if a pilot closed his eyes he would miss his target. In the final moments before the crash, the pilot was to shout \"Hissatsu!\" (\"Critical Strike!\") as loud as he could.\nHowever, many others did so because of social pressure. Not offering oneself as a volunteer was a sign of cowardice and dishonor. Several professional pilots who were ordered to do suicide attacks did it because of military obedience, not because of honor. One of the first \"kamikaze\" pilots, Lieutenant Yukio Seki, wrote after nearly being forced to volunteer:\nA special ceremony before going to combat usually took place. Pilots drank sake and ate a ball of rice. They were given medals, and a katana sword. They put on a headband with the rising sun, and a \"sennibari\", a \"belt of a thousand stitches\" made by a thousand women, who made one stitch each. Many times, they took prayers written by their families with them. According to legend, young pilots on \"kamikaze\" missions many times flew southwest from Japan over the 922-metre (~3000\u00a0ft) Mount Kaimon. Suicide mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see this, and said farewell to their country. Another legend says that \"kamikaze\" pilots dropped flowers from the air, as they departed on their final missions. Some places, like the hills near Kikajima airport, are said to have beds of cornflower that bloom in early May from those days.\nSome important military men who survived the war criticized the \"kamikaze\" plan years after. Saburo Sakai, a war time ace pilot said:"}

It was most popular in France, where its leaders included philosophers like Voltaire and Denis Diderot. Diderot helped spread the Enlightenment's ideas by writing the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\", the first big encyclopedia that was available to everyone. The Enlightenment grew partly out of the earlier scientific revolution and the ideas of Ren\u00e9 Descartes.\nEnlightenment ideas.\nThe Enlightenment's most important idea was that all people can reason and think for themselves. Because of this, people should not automatically believe what an authority says. People do not even have to believe what churches teach or what priests say. This was a very new idea at the time.\nAnother important idea was that a society is best when everyone works together to create it. Even people with very little power or money should have the same rights as the rich and powerful to help create the society they live in. The nobility should not have special rights or privileges any more. \nThese were very new ideas at the time. They were also dangerous thoughts for the people in power. Many Enlightenment philosophers were put in prison or were forced to leave their home countries.\nEffects.\nMany of the Founding Fathers of the United States believed the Enlightenment's ideas. For example, the idea that a government's job is to benefit all of a country's people not just the people in power was very important to them. They made this idea about a government \"for the people\" one of the most important parts of the new United States Constitution and the new American government they created.\nThe Enlightenment's ideas were also important to the people who fought in the French Revolution of 1789. \nIn some countries, kings and queens took some of the Enlightenment's ideas and made changes to their governments. However, they still kept power for themselves. These kings and queens were called \"enlightened despots.\" Examples include Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, and Gustav III of Sweden.\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, as more and more people began to use reason, some began to disagree with the idea that God created the world. This caused conflicts - and, later, war. \nMany ideas that are important today were created during the Enlightenment. Examples of these ideas include: \nThe Enlightenment's ideas about thinking with reason, having personal freedoms, and not having to follow the Catholic Church were important in creating capitalism and socialism. \nImportant Enlightenment figures.\nImportant people in the Enlightenment came from many different countries and shared ideas in many different ways. Some of the best-known Enlightenment figures, organized by home country, are:"}

Its usage varies in different places.\nAccipitrine hawks generally take birds as their primary prey. They have also been called \"hen-hawks\", or \"wood-hawks\" because of their woodland habitat. Within the hawk species, the female is generally larger than the male. Like most birds, the hawk migrates in the autumn and the spring. \nEyesight.\nHawks, like most vertebrates, have four types of colour receptors in the eye. They can see not only the visible range, but also the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Other adaptations let them detect polarised light and magnetic fields. \nThey have many photoreceptors in their retina, and an exceptional number of nerves connecting the receptors to the brain. There is an indented fovea, which magnifies the central portion of the visual field.\nHawks have always been known to have sharp vision and to be very able hunters."}

She is one of the most well known athletes in South Korea.\nAs of April 2010, she became the first in the world by the International Skating Union. She was also the first female skater to pass the 200-point mark under the ISU Judging System.\nPersonal life.\nKim Yu-Na was born in 1990 in Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, and moved to Gunpo when she was six. In March 2007, she went to Canada to train for her figure skating with her judge, Brian Orser. In 2009, Kim went into Korea University, but she still continued her training in Canada.\nThe right spelling of her name is 'Kim Yeona'. However, when she applied for a passport, she wanted her name written as 'Yun-a', but the official made a mistake and wrote her name as 'Yu-na'. In Korean 'Yu-na' would be written as \"\uc720\ub098\" and not \"\uc5f0\uc544\".\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nKim began skating when she was seven years old. At that time, her coach, Ryu Jong-Hyeon, approved of Kim's talent. Because of this, he told Kim's mother that Kim should continue to train and become a competitive figure skater, as Yuna had perfect conditions and great skills for her age to become a figure skater.\nIn 2002, she competed internationally for the first time at the Triglav Trophy and won a gold medal there. A year later, when she was 12 years old, she won the senior title at the South Korean Figure Skating Championships. She was the youngest skater ever to win that title. She won her second international contest at the Golden Bear of Zagreb.\nJunior career.\n2004\u20132005 season.\nIn the 2004\u20132005 season, as a junior skater, Kim competed at the ISU Junior Grand Prix, which is a junior complement to the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. She won a silver medal at the event in China and a gold medal at the event in Hungary. She won a silver medal at the 2005 Junior Grand Prix Final with an overall score of 137.75 points.\nShe retained her National Championship title for the third year in a row on her way to the 2005 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. At that competition, she won a silver medal again, earning 158.93 points.\n2005\u20132006 season.\nFor the 2005\u20132006 season, Kim was not old enough to compete at the 2006 Olympics.\nSo instead, she went to the 2005\u20132006 Junior Grand Prix and won both of the contests, in Bulgaria and Slovakia. At the 2006 Junior Grand Prix Final, she won the competition by getting 28.34 points more than Aki Sawada, who had gotten the silver medal. During her freeskate, she made seven triple jumps, including a triple flip.\nAt the 2006 World Junior Figure Skating Championships, she was the rival of Mao Asada, a Japanese figure-skater, and won the gold medal. When she won this medal, she had made 177.54 points.\nSenior career.\n2006\u20132007 season.\nIn order to prepare for her next contest in the 2006\u20132007 season, Kim practiced very much at the Skating and Curling Club of Toronto in Canada during the summer of 2006. She was trained by Brian Orser and David Wilson.\nKim won a bronze medal at the 2006 Skate Canada after earning a score of 168.48 points. She won the 2006 Troph\u00e9e Eric Bompard with a score of 184.54 points, 10.10 ahead of Miki Ando, the skater who got the silver medal. Those performances made Kim be allowed to the Grand Prix Final in St. Petersburg, Russia. At this place, Kim won, earning 184.20 points, which was 11.68 points more than Mao Asada, who earned the silver medal.\nKim was forced to stop because she got hurt at the 2006\u20132007 South Korean Championships. Because of this, she had to go to the hospital.\nKim was picked to compete at the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships. During the World Championships in Tokyo, Japan, Kim won the short program with 71.95 points, setting a world record. She placed fourth in the long program scoring 114.19 points, and finished the third one with 186.14 points behind Miki Ando and Mao Asada of Japan. Kim's points helped two more South Korean ladies come for the 2008 World Figure Skating Championships.\nIn March 2007, Brian Orser became Kim's new full-time coach. Because she liked the training environment in Toronto, Kim made Toronto her training home. Her coaches included at that time Brian Orser, Astrid Shrubb, David Wilson, and Tracy Wilson.\n2007\u20132008 season.\nKim started off the 2007\u20132008 season by winning the 2007 Cup of China with a score of 180.68 points, which was 24.34 ahead of Caroline Zhang, who had gotten the silver medal. At the 2007 Cup of Russia, Kim won both the short program scoring 63.50 points and the free skate with 133.70 points. So she set a world record for the free skate score under the ISU Judging System.

Its first competition was at the World Figure Skating Championships in 1952, but it did not become a Winter Olympic Games medal sport until 1976. As in pair skating, dancers compete as a couple, a man and a woman. \nIce dancing is different from pair skating because it limits the figures to those which are imitative of dance. Skaters must stay close together, and may not perform jumps. There are set dances, in which the style must be appropriate for the type of dance, and there is a Free Dance section which allows lifts up to shoulder level.\nIce dancing is the only form of figure skating to allow vocal music in official competitions."}

Lisa starts a campaign with a new boy named Colin, who is Irish. They want to stop the people of Springfield from dumping in the lake. Everyone agrees to this and the lake is cleared up. Marge questions Homer about Spider pigs 'leavings'. He says he has put them in a silo. This causes Marge to say \"Get rid of the silo properly.\" Homer agrees to this, and Marge says he is allowed to take Spider Pig with him. To which Homer tells Marge \"He's not Spider Pig anymore, he's Harry Plopper\". This is a reference to Harry Potter. The pig even has the lightning bolt scar and the thick glasses, just like Harry Potter. Homer drives to the waste site to get rid of the silo. Homer's friend and co-worker Lenny calls him from a donut store and tells him that they are giving out free donuts. Homer, with his love for donuts, tries to find a different way to getting rid of his silo. He then drives to the now clean lake. He ignores the \"No Dumping\" signs and dumps the silo into the lake. The lake then bubbles up and turns into a toxic poison. "}

She is the 2005 World Junior Champion. She won the silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Her older sister Mai Asada is also a high-level skater.\nLife.\nAsada is from Nagoya. She was very skilled from a young age. She landed her first triple axel in competition while still at the junior level. She is one of five female figure skaters who have ever landed that jump in international competition.\nAsada won won everything on the Junior level in the 2004-2005 season. The next season was the Olympic season. Asada would be too young to compete at the 2006 Olympics. But the Japanese skating federation thought there was not a good reason to keep her at the Junior level when she had already won everything. Asada was old enough for the Grand Prix, but not for senior level ISU championships. Asada went into the Grand Prix without any of the pressure that was on the other skaters who were old enough to go the Olympics and were trying to qualify for spots on their country's Olympic team. Able to compete without pressure, Asada won the Grand Prix Final in December 2005.\nFollowing her win, the Japanese skating federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee to make an exception to the age rule for Asada, claiming that depriving her of a chance to compete at the 2006 Olympics would be denying a medal contender a chance to compete. However, this petition, even if it had worked, would have been too late. Other skaters had been effected by the age rule. The South Korean skating federation, for example, held Kim Yu-Na back in juniors for the 2005-2006 season, even though she could have competed successfully on the Grand Prix, because she also was not old enough for the Olympics, and because of it did not earn a spot to the Olympics at the Olympic Qualifying Competition in the fall of 2005. Asada had been a force in Japanese skating for many years, so the federation could have petitioned for an exception years earlier. There had previously been a loophole in eligibility rules regarding the World Championships and medalling at the World Junior Championships, but that loophole had been closed years earlier, and it had never applied to the Olympics.\nInstead, Asada went to the World Junior Championships again, where she lost to Kim Yu-Na.\nIn 2006-2007, Asada's first season being old enough for senior Worlds, she won the silver medal at the World Championships behind fellow Japanese skater Miki Ando.\nMao Asada is known for her amazing flexibility. She is known for her one-handed Biellmann spin and her cross-grab Biellmann spiral, in which she uses the hand opposite her leg to hold up her leg in the position. She is consistent with the triple axel."}

Originally, it meant speaking in a public place for or against a person or a proposal.

Gradually, it came to mean someone who spoke in public on formal occasions.\nOratory, or rhetoric, is the skill of argument or persuasion used by orators. The invention of printing allowed books to be multiplied and produced cheaply. This has made it possible for orators to do their persuasion in print as well as speaking. Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill are good examples of how orators in the 20th century used media such as radio and movies where once they could only use speech. Both wrote books which sold in large numbers, though Churchill's books were about more than politics. Today television and newspapers play a vital role in deciding elections; the web less so.\nOther types of orator are those who wish to change beliefs.

{"id": "68988", "revid": "1138038", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68988", "title": "Parsifal", "text": "Parsifal is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. Wagner took most of the story from a medieval poem \"Parzival\" by the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach. It was the last opera that Wagner completed. He started thinking about it in 1857 but did not do much work to it until after he had finished the cycle of four operas known as the Ring Cycle which was produced complete in 1876 in the special theatre (Festspielhaus) he had built in Bayreuth. Wagner composed his opera \"Parsifal\" so that it would suit the sound of this new theatre. It was first produced in 1882. The story is related to the Arthurian legends.\nThe Musical background to the opera.\nWagner did more than any other composer in the 19th century to change the way that people listened to opera. In the 18th century people went to the opera house and sat in their boxes to chat to other people and be seen. Composers wrote operas with big arias which allowed the singers to show off their skills and make the audience applaud.\nWagner changed all this. He soon developed operas in which there is no difference between recitative (where the story is told) and arias (big songs for the soloists). The music of his later operas, especially \"Parsifal\", is like a long, continuous line with rich, Romantic harmony. The music develops logically, with leitmotifs (very short pieces of music which represent particular people or ideas) which help the music and the story to develop.\nThe story of Parsifal.\nThe story of Parsifal and the Holy Grail has survived in several forms that date from between 1170 and 1220. Wagner, who always wrote the words of his operas himself, used a mixture of several of these versions of the story to fit his ideas for the opera. Parsifal is a young man who is a \u201cpure fool\u201d, which means that he is an innocent, good man who slowly starts to understand the world. The Holy Grail is the cup from which Jesus Christ is supposed to have drunk at the Last Supper. The Holy Spear is the spear which is supposed to have been the one with which the Roman soldier pierced Jesus\u2019 side when he was put on the cross. The Holy Grail and the Holy Spear are sacred relics (things from the past) which have been given to Titurel and his band of Christian knights to look after. Titurel has built a castle, Montsalvat, high up on the forest rocks, to guard them. In particular, he has to watch out for Klingsor who lives nearby. Klingsor is a magician who has a garden full of beautiful flower-maidens. These maidens are in his power. One of them is Kundry. She has already been made to several young knights to Klingsor\u2019s power. Even Titurel\u2019s son, Amfortas, could not resist the lure of Kundry. His spear was taken from him and he was badly wounded before being rescued. At the beginning of the opera he is lying in pain. The only thing that could heal the wound would be the touch of the Holy Spear which Klingsor now has, and the only person who could get that spear back again is a \u201cpure fool\u201d, a young man who knows nothing about the evil of the world and who can resist the beauty of the flower-maidens.\nThe story of the opera.\nAct I.\nThe opera starts with an orchestral prelude (Wagner does not call it an \u201coverture\u201d). When the curtain rises Gurnemanz, one of the senior knights, wakes up two sleeping servants. They kneel and pray as King Amfortas is brought down on his bed to the forest lake to bathe his wound. Kundry arrives, dashing in on her horse, looking for something to heal the wound (when Kundry is away from Klingsor she is not in his power. She feels that it was her fault that Amfortas was wounded. When Kundry is not in Klingsor\u2019s power she is actually a faithful messenger of the Grail).\nSuddenly a wounded swan (a bird that is sacred to the knights of the Grail) falls dead at Gurnemanz\u2019s feet. The swan had been killed by Parsifal. He did not know that it was a wrong thing to do, but when the knights capture him he realizes his and he breaks the arrow. The knights ask him his name, but Parsifal says he does not know his name or where he comes from. Suddenly the knights realize that Parsifal is the pure fool they need who can capture the Holy Spear.\nThe scene changes. The knights take communion. Amfortas is in terrible pain but has to do his duty in the ceremony. When the Holy Grail is shown it sparkles brightly in the hall. The knights sink to their knees. Only Parsifal does not seem to understand the meaning of it all.\nAct II.\nThe scene is Klingsor\u2019s magic garden by his castle. Kundry has been summoned by him is now quite different: she has no power of her own, and is controlled and tormented by Klingsor. Klingsor notices Parsifal, whom he is expecting, approach from the distance, and sends his magical knights to fight him, expecting them to be defeated by Parsifal. The flower-maidens, the wives of the knights, see Parsifal and call him by his name. No one has ever called him by his name before. When one of them kisses his lips he suddenly realizes what it is he has to do. He now remembers everything that has happened in Act I and understands its meaning. He throws the maiden to one side. Klingsor appears and throws the spear at Parsifal, but magically it stops over Parsifal\u2019s head. Parsifal grabs it and makes the sign of the cross. The castle is destroyed, the gardens disappear, and he goes off back to the Grail.\nAct III.\nAfter a journey which takes him many years Parsifal comes back to the Grail forest. Gurnemanz is now very old. Kundry works for the knights. Parsifal himself is dressed as a black knight. Kundry recognizes him, but Gurnemanz does not. He is annoyed that an armed stranger should come on this holy day (it is Good Friday). Parsifal throws the spear into the ground, puts down his weapons and takes off his helmet. Gurnemanz realizes who it is. He helps him to dress like a knight of the Grail. Kundry washes his feet and dries them with her long hair. Gurnemanz blesses Parsifal\u2019s head. Parsifal is now a knight of the Grail, and he baptizes Kundry. Titurel has just died, and Amfortas, still in terrible pain, comes out to uncover the Grail. Parsifal enters and touches the wound with the point of the spear. Amfortas\u2019s pain changes to happiness, the shrine is opened, the Grail is surrounded by light. The knights kneel down, Kundry dies peacefully. All is forgiven. The music finishes with a climax based on the leitmotifs of the Holy Grail and the Sacrament.\nThe performances of Parsifal.\nUntil 1903, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus was the only place where Wagner\u2019s opera \"Parsifal\" was allowed to be performed. In 1903, the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Soon, it was being performed in other places as well.\nWagner like to describe \"Parsifal\" as \"ein B\u00fchnenweihfestspiel\" (\"A Festival Play for the Consecration of the Stage\"). At Bayreuth, it has become tradition that there is to be no applause after the first act of the opera.\nThe conductor of the first performance was Hermann Levi, the court conductor at the Munich Opera. Wagner objected to Parsifal being conducted by a Jew (Levi's father was in fact a rabbi). Wagner first suggested that Levi should convert to Christianity, which Levi declined to do. Wagner then wrote to King Ludwig that he had decided to accept Levi. This despite the fact that (he alleged) he had received complaints that \"of all pieces, this most Christian of works\" should be conducted by a Jew. The King expressed his satisfaction at this. He said that \"human beings are basically all brothers\". Wagner wrote to the King that he \"regard[ed] the Jewish race as the born enemy of pure humanity and everything noble about it\"."}

Both of these characters came from the kanji characters that made up manyogana.\nToday, there are 46 basic sounds in Japanese that are each represented by a hiragana and a corresponding katakana character as seen in the chart below. (The characters for the sounds \"wi\" and \"we\" are no longer used.) There are 25 other sounds that can be made by adding one of two diacritics: a dakuten or a handakuten. Also, 12 of the kana come in a smaller size to make other combinations of syllables.\nJapanese sentences are usually written using a mix of hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Although it is possible to write a sentence in only hiragana or katakana characters, it is hard for most Japanese people to understand because the kanji symbols represent a concept which the kana do not show. Small kana symbols, however, can be put above kanji to show how it is pronounced (this is called furigana and is used a lot in karaoke).\nBesides kana, Japanese sounds can also be written in Romaji (using the Roman alphabet) to help people who do not speak Japanese learn the language."}

{"id": "68991", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68991", "title": "Tropical Storm Erin (2007)", "text": "Tropical Storm Erin was the second tropical cyclone to make landfall on the United States in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the fifth named storm of the season. Erin formed in the Gulf of Mexico on August 14 from an area of convection which was becoming stronger. It became stronger and changed into a tropical storm the next day, and on August 16 Erin made landfall near Lamar, Texas and was able to not die as it moved over land across Texas before moving towards the north into Oklahoma. The storm killed at least 17 people and made an already-severe flooding problem in Texas even worse. Another different storm that Erin went into killed at least 18 people.\nStorm history.\nOn August 9, an area of convection formed just south of Jamaica in association with a trough of low pressure. The system moved west-northwestward, and by August 10, the system had a broad surface trough with a little shower activity. Convection increased on August 11, and by August 12 the contact between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the area resulted in a large area of disorganized thunderstorms extending from the western Caribbean Sea into the central Bahamas. Upper-level winds slowly became more helpful for development, and on August 13 a large low pressure area formed about 90\u00a0miles (145\u00a0km) north-northeast of Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo. Late on August 14, a NOAA Hurricane Hunters plane that flew into the system reported a small circulation center, but at the time was not well-defined enough to begin tropical cyclone advisories. However, deep convection was kept near the increasingly organizaing center, and at 0300\u00a0UTC on August 15 the National Hurricane Center named it as Tropical Depression Five about 425\u00a0miles (685\u00a0km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas.\nIn the overnight hours after formation, the storm was disorganized with a shabby and abstracted center of circulation. Located to the south of a mid to upper-level ridge over the southern United States, the system moved to the west-northwest into an area ideal for further strengthening; an upper-level anticyclone formed over the central Gulf of Mexico, and sea surface temperatures along its track were warm. The cloud pattern became better organized, keeping a large area of convection with curved rainbands and well-established outflow. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Erin at 1530\u00a0UTC on August 13 about 250\u00a0miles (400\u00a0km) east of Brownsville, Texas. As it continued northwestward, Erin remained disorganized and was not able to strengthen above minimal tropical storm status. At 1200\u00a0UTC on August 16 the cyclone made landfall near Lamar, Texas as it weakened to tropical depression status. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center stopped giving out advisories on Erin as warning responsibility was switched to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.\nSlowly moving northwestward through Texas, Tropical Depression Erin managed to keep an area of convection near the center, with its widespread, but scattered rainbands dropping moderate to heavy precipitation. By August 17, the winds decreased to 20\u00a0mph (30\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts. The system turned to the north-northeast on August 18, while heavy bands of thunderstorms continued to spin around the center of Erin. Early on August 19 after entering Oklahoma, Erin suddenly re-intensified to maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) a short distance west of Oklahoma City. The Norman, Oklahoma National Weather Service remarked the intensification \"[resulted] in what amounts to an inland tropical storm;\" at 0930\u00a0UTC the system showed an eye-like feature and a spiral rainband, and produced wind gusts of over 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). However, a few hours later, the system began weakening again, and late on August 19 Erin degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as the circulation dissipated over northeastern Oklahoma. The low continued into southeastern Kansas before dissipating, feeding moisture northward toward a frontal system extending from the Midwestern United States through the Mid-Atlantic States. Its remnant mid-level circulation then moved eastward across Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia before losing identity as it moved out into the Atlantic Ocean.\nPreparations.\nInstantly after Erin become a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center gave out a tropical storm watch from Freeport, Texas to the United States/Mexico border; at the same time, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch southward to Rio San Fernando. Shortly before achieving tropical storm status, the watch in Texas was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Late on August 15, the warning was extended to San Luis Pass, while the watch in Mexico was cancelled. As Erin made landfall, the warnings was cancelled, and several flood watches and warnings were given out for counties across southeastern Texas. Upon moving into Oklahoma, flood and flash flood warnings were issued for several counties.\nGovernor of Texas, Rick Perry activated the National Guard and moved emergency personnel to the areas expected to be affected by the storm. Erin is expected to bring flooding to the region, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 from widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), because of fears of Erin disturbing oil supplies produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil supplies.&lt;ref name=\"oil futures 8/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the threat from the storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188\u00a0workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.\nImpact.\nTexas.\nBy midday on August 15, rainbands with gusty winds began affecting the Texas coastline. As it made landfall, the storm created heavy rainfall near and to the or northeast of its path, reaching 11.02\u00a0inches (280\u00a0mm) at a station in Lockwood. The passage of the storm caused several bayous in the Houston area to reach or go beyond flood levels. Across southeastern Texas, the cyclone generated several funnel clouds, and near Iah a EF0 tornado was reported. Wind gusts from Erin were fairly weak across the state, peaking at 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) at Palacios with an unofficial report of 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h) at Jamaica Beach. While moving onto land, the storm produced a small storm surge peaking at 3.22\u00a0feet (0.98\u00a0m) at Pleasure Pier, which caused minor beach erosion.\nIn Clear Lake City, heavy rainfall broke down a part of a grocery store roof, killing two workers. The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern parts of Harris County; over 400\u00a0homes and 40\u00a0businesses were flooded. Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly stopped the METRORail and closed several state roads. One person drowned after driving into a retention pond. Several people needed rescue assistance, and in Comal County a car accident killed three people. The movement of the storm temporarily left about 20,000\u00a0electrical customers without power, though most outages were quickly restored. In San Antonio, one body was found from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was swept into a drainage ditch in which four others survived. In Sisterdale, two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek In Taylor County, near Abilene, flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2,000\u00a0people.\nOklahoma.\nAfter its unexpected redevelopment over Oklahoma, heavy damages were also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded from the effects of heavy rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were flooded. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82\u00a0mph (131\u00a0km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, also with about 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.\nOne person was found to have drowned in a cellar in Fort Cobb, and another drowned in Kingfisher. Another storm-related death took place in Seminole. Three others were found dead after a weather-related automobile accident also near Carnegie. Another automobile accident-related death took place in Okmulgee County but it is not sure if Erin is to blame there.\nMissouri.\nAlthough its surface circulation had dissipated, its upper circulation remained unbroken and created a burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94\u00a0inches/303.3\u00a0mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1976. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was trying to navigate onto. Nine water rescues happened along the Interstate 44 passageway, which was most effected by Erin's rainfall."}

It is performed on one foot. The free leg (the leg not on the ice) is pulled up from behind and pulled above the head. The knee is bent slightly and the back is bent backwards into the spin. This forms a teardrop position with the body. In the classic version of the spin, both arms are used to hold up the leg. A slightly changed version has one hand on the skate and the other hand on the arm holding up the skate. A change can be made in that one hand can be dropped. If the hand holding up the spin is on the same side of the body as the leg, the spin is referred to as a \"one-hand Biellmann spin\", because the spin is being performed with one hand. If the hand holding up the spin is on the opposite side of the body as the leg, the spin is referred to as a \"cross-grab Biellmann spin\", because that hand has to \"cross\" the body to \"grab\" the skate.\nThe spin has also been said to look like a \"tulip on a turntable\". It is one of the most iconic figure skating moves. Along with the layback spin, the Biellmann is used in advertisements and icons representing figure skating. The position is also used in spiral sequences.\nSpin history.\nNo one knows who invented the spin. Cecilia Colledge of Great Britain performed a one-handed Biellmann spin in 1937. There is a famous photograph of her doing the spin at the 1937 World Figure Skating Championships. Tamara Moskvina of the Soviet Union performed the spin at the 1965 European Championships and there is a famous photo of her doing it as well. Both Janet Champion and Slavka Kohout of the United States performed this spin early on.\nThe spin is named after Swiss skater Denise Biellmann, who popularized the move. Biellmann performed the spin beginning in the 1970s, having learned it from her teammate, fellow Swiss skater Karin Iten. Biellmann performed the spin on her way to becoming World Champion and the spin was officially named for her. It is the only figure skating spin officially named after a skater in International Skating Union regulations.\nPositions.\nThe classic positions is explained above. This position is often entered into through a layback spin. The free leg of the layback is grasped by one or both hands and brought up above the head.\nIrina Slutskaya of Russia is officially credited with inventing the \"change foot Biellmann spin\". She performs the Biellmann on one foot, then drops her free leg and performs the spin on her other leg.\nA \"half-Biellmann spin\", also called the \"catch-foot camel spin\", is a Biellmann variation in which the free leg is grasped in a camel spin position and brought up above the head, but the upper body is not lifted into the teardrop position.\nMany skaters have performed a Biellmann variation in which the free leg is brought down towards the face, with the knee bent inwards. This spin has mostly been performed by Junior-level or Junior-age skaters, because this is easiest to perform before puberty. It is unknown who invented this variation. It was performed by Naomi Nari Nam at the United States nationals in 1999. More recently it has been brought back by Junior level skaters including Caroline Zhang of the United States who performed the spin on her way to winning the 2007 World Junior title.\nAs well, Zhang and other Junior skaters are known for doing a \"hyper-extended\" Biellmann spin in which the leg is pulled straight up in the air and the back bent as far into the spin as possible. Zhang is able to perform the spin with her free leg pulled straight up into the air, making the spin look like a capital-I. This position is not original to Zhang, but she has been the one to popularize it.\nIn skating competitions.\nBecause of Code of Points, the Biellmann spin has been used too much in competitions. Many skaters would perform the spin even if they were not flexible enough because it was a good way of getting a lot of points. The International Skating Union has limited the number of Biellmann spins that can be performed in a single program.\nThe spin is almost entirely performed by women, and it is a common feature in most Junior and Senior level ladies programs, as well as being a position for ice dancing lifts. It is generally not performed by men because most male skaters are not flexible enough to perform the spin. The most famous male skater to perform the spin is Evgeni Plushenko. However, he has not done it in competition since 2003. Shawn Sawyer has also performed the spin at the Junior level. Recently, the spin has been performed in competition by Ryo Shibata of Japan and Eliot Halverson of the United States."}

It is also referred to as sponging, spanging (short for \"spare-changing\") or (in American English) panhandling.\nIn larger cities, it is common to see beggars who ask for money, food, or other items. Typically, beggars often beg for spare change using coffee cups, mugs, small boxes, hats, or other items into which monies can be placed and sometimes display signs with messages such as \"Help me. I'm homeless.\"\nUse of funds obtained by begging.\nA 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $638 CAD, those interviewed spent a median of $200 CAD on food and $192 CAD on alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. The Fraser Institute, however, criticized this study. They said there were many forms of begging including ones in which good money can be earned. They also said that panhandlers' reports were not reliable \nBecause of this, some people say that it would be better to give the beggars gift cards or food/service vouchers, instead of money. Some shelters also offer business cards with information on the shelter's location and services, which can be given instead of cash.\nAggressive panhandling.\nAggressive panhandling means to ask for donations or help in a threatening manner. This is not mugging, but rather similar and therefore often forbidden by law. Examples include:"}

They are much more important in plant and fungus cells than in animal cells. Some common jobs of a vacuole are to:\nVacuoles are also important in autophagy, keeping a balance between making and getting rid of many things in cells and organisms.

It was founded in 1484 by King Richard III, and its job is to control heraldry and grant new \"armorial bearings\", sometime called coats of arms.\nThe college is run by the Kings of Arms, heralds and pursuivants who handle heraldic affairs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on behalf of the Queen. (Scotland has its own heraldic authority: Lord Lyon King of Arms and his office.)\nThe college also grants arms to citizens of other Commonwealth countries that do not have their own heralds. (Canadians use Canadian Heraldic Authority and South Africans have the Bureau of Heraldry)\nAs well as designing and granting new arms, the College tries to answer many requests from people trying to prove that they are descended from an \"armigerous\" (arms-bearing) person; a person descended in the male line (or through heraldic heiresses) from an armiger may be reissued that ancestor's arms. Special marks called difference marks can be added make the coat of arms different from the arms of their cousins. The college is involved in genealogy and have many pedigrees (family trees) in their records. Anyone may register a pedigree with the college, where they are carefully checked and need official proofs before being altered.\nHeralds were originally messengers. Officers of the College of Arms still sometimes read Royal proclamations in public, for example at the accession of a new sovereign.\nThey also help plan state ceremonies, such as coronations, the introduction of new peers into the House of Lords, and the ceremonies of orders of chivalry.\nFor these public appearances, the officers of the college wear costume showing their place in the Royal Household, either simple red livery or the herald's traditional colourful outfit of a tabard emblazoned with his master's arms (in this case the royal arms).\nThe College of Arms is on Queen Victoria Street in the City of London, not far to the south of St. Paul's Cathedral. The site was given to the college when it was re-formed by Philip and Mary I in 1555, and the present 17th century building dates from after the Great Fire of London in 1666.\nThe College of Arms was featured in the 1969 James Bond movie \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" where James Bond visits his friend Sir Hillary Bray who permits Bond to impersonate him so he can spy on Blofeld's base. Bray gives Bond information on Blofeld's ancestor Count Balthazzar de Bleuchamp. Bond is shown his own coat of arms with the family motto: \"the world is not enough\" (this was used for the title of the 19th Bond movie \"The World Is Not Enough\").\nThe officers.\nThe Earl Marshal, a hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk, oversees the College, but he is not a member. He must give his written consent, called a warrant, before any new coat of arms can be issued. The Earl Marshal's court (called the Court of Chivalry) can hear cases about using coats arms, but the court has not sat since 1954. Usually the Earl Marshal usually leaves affairs to the professional heralds of the College.\nThere are, three levels of officers of arms: Kings of Arms, Heralds, and Pursuivants. The officers of arms occupy posts bearing traditional titles:\nThe officers of arms earn money from their own private practices in heraldry and genealogy. They get only nominal salaries as officers of the College. These salaries were set centuries ago and reflect the living costs of the day. William IV reduced them to the old level in the 1830s. The amounts are listed below, and is not taxed:\nAny letters, telephone calls or visitors to the college not for a specific officer of arms are seen by the \"officer in waiting\". All members of the college serve as officer in waiting on rotation.\n\"Heralds Extraordinary\" are appointed to take part in special ceremonial occasions or to help the Earl Marshal personally; they are not members of the college. Among the extraordinary heralds have been \u2014 \nThe New Zealand Herald Extraordinary is not a member of the college but it is a permanent post created to oversee heraldry in New Zealand; he works together with the college to grant new arms for people and bodies in that country (where he himself lives and works).\nGrants and descent of arms.\nThe Kings of Arms grant coats of arms by letters patent. Before they can even consider the granting of arms, an application, (called a \"memorial\") must be made to the Earl Marshal, and a fee paid.\nThe Kings of Arms are authorised in their \"patents of appointment\" (the letter giving them their job) to grant coats of arms to \"eminent men\". Originally this meant someone who was rich or had social status. By 1530, the heralds wanted successful candidates for a grant of arms to have \u00a3300 or rent from land of \u00a310 a year. Since the heralds get fees for granting arms, they have always been generous when deciding who should be allowed a coat of arms. In 1616, Ralphe Brooke, York Herald, tricked the Garter King of Arms into granting a coat of arms to the common hangman for a fee of 22 shillings (\u00a31-20p).\nThis is why the Earl Marshal's permission to grant a coat of arms is needed. \nThere are no fixed rules about granting modern coats of arms. If a herald is approached and does not consider that the application has merit, he may tactfully suggest to the applicant that he or she should not proceed. If it does proceed, its success or otherwise will depend on the approval of the Earl Marshal, who may apply his own standards. Peter Gwynn-Jones has recently written that\nThe coat of arms, or a differenced version of them using marks of cadency, can be used by \"all\" of the legitimate children of an individual and such children and their descendants may bear the arms (or a differenced version of them) from the moment of birth: they do not have to wait for the death of the previous generation. The College of Arms does not need to approve the use of the arms in each generation: the original grant of arms is the only authority required. Although daughters and sons inherit the right to bear arms for themselves personally, the right passes only through the male line: hence, a son transmits the arms to his children, but a daughter, can use them herself, but her children cannot. A partial exception to this rule is the case of a woman who has no brothers, or whose brothers have no children; such a woman is called a heraldic heiress and may transmit the arms to her children as a quartering with their father's arms, and to their descendents.\nThe costs involved are quite substantial. The applicant does not buy a coat of arms: the arms themselves are freely given, but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists involved as professionals, and to support the buildings and other running costs of the College. Aside from the heralds' traditional nominal salaries, given above, the College of Arms is not financed by the taxpayer.\nName changes.\nThe College of Arms is also responsible for recording the changes of names. In order to change one's name, one must apply for a deed poll to be entered on the College's registers and published in the London Gazette.\nWhen a Royal Licence is granted for a transfer of arms, the change of the surname may be permitted by the Licence itself, so there is no need of a deed poll."}

It is when the two or yet many solutions are being compared is not of equal amount. Solving an inequality means finding its solutions. When you substitute a number to a variable and the statement is true, then it is a solution. When you substitute a number to a variable and the statement is not true then, the number is not a solution to the statement.\nSolving inequality is finding a solution to a given variable. It is finding a relative order of a set. Inequality might have many solutions, but usually only solutions as real numbers are the ones we are looking for. The proper way to read inequality is from left to right, just like the other equations, but the only difference is that they have different rules for every equation.\nFor example, consider the inequality x+4&gt;12, where x is a real number. First, one needs to find the x and verify that it is actually a solution. The answer will be x&gt;8 and it is a true statement. This expression is about the location of x within the set of real numbers. A number line is one way to show the location relative to all other real numbers.(See figure Inequality 1)\nDifferent kinds of inequalities.\nThere are five different kinds of inequalities:\nFour ways to solve Inequalities.\nThere are four ways to solve quadratic equations:\nFurthermore, it will take two steps to solve an inequality. The first one is to simplify using the reciprocal of addition or subtraction. The second one is to simplify more by using the reciprocal of multiplication or division. Note that when multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be reversed.\nExamples of how to solve Inequalities.\nInequality is a mathematical statement that explains that the two values are not equal and are different. The equation a\u2260b means that \"a\" is not equal to \"b\". Inequality is the same with any equation, with the (only) difference that inequality does not use an equal sign but inequality symbols. The inequality b&gt;a means that b is greater than a. Speed limits, mark, and others use inequality to express them.\nWhen solving an inequality, a person need to have a true statement. When you divide or multiply an inequality with a negative number on both sides, the statement is false. In order to make the statement correct with a negative number, one must reverse the direction of the inequality symbol. When a number is a positive number, one does not need to reverse the symbol. Inequality is about making a true statement.\nFor example, start with a true statement -6\"y\"&lt;-12. When both sides are divided by -6, the result will become y&lt;2. In this statement, the symbol need to be reversed in order to have a true statement, which produces y&gt;2 as the correct answer. In the number line (see figure Inequality 2), a closed shaded circle points out that it is included in the solution set. An open circle points out that it is not included in the solution set."}

Hilbert used it as an example to show how infinity does not act in the same way as regular numbers do.\nThe paradox.\nNormal hotels have a set number of rooms. This number is finite. Once every room has been assigned to a guest, any new guest that wants a room and does not have one yet cannot be served - in other words, the hotel is fully booked.\nNow suppose that there is a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms. As a convenience, the rooms have numbers, the first room has the number 1, the second has number 2, and so on. If all the rooms are filled, it might appear that no more guests can be taken in, as in a hotel with a finite number of rooms. This is wrong, though. A room can be provided for another guest. This can be done by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on. In the general case, the guest in room \"n\" will be moved to room \"n+1\". After all guests have moved, room 1 is empty, and the new guest now has a room to occupy. This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full, something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms.\nIn case of infinitely new guests.\nAnother thing that can be done with this imaginary hotel is to double the number of people inside, again when all the rooms are already full. This is done by asking each guest to multiply their room number by two and move to that room. (If their previous room number was \"n\", this time they would move to room number \"2n\".) This would send the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 4, the guest in room 3 to room 6, the guest in room 4 to room 8, and so on. After finishing, we find that all the rooms with the odd numbers are empty. Then we can put an infinite number of guests into these empty rooms. Now the number of guests in the hotel has been doubled without making the hotel bigger.\nIf infinite groups of infinite guests come.\nThe guest at room 11 would move to room 101.\nThe second person of group 5 (Address 5-2) would go to room 25.\nThis is not really a paradox, it is only counterintuitive. In a normal hotel, with a finite number of rooms, the number of \"odd-numbered\" rooms, is smaller than the total number of rooms. In Hilbert's Hotel this does not seem to be the case. \nIn case of infinite vehicles of infinite groups of infinite guests.\nThe guest 1 of group 2 of vehicle 1 (1-2-1) goes to room 121.\nFurther layers of infinity.\nInfinite aircraft carriers of the same infinite vehicles.\nAddress 4-7-7-4 goes to room 4774.\nInfinite spacecraft of the same infinite aircraft carriers..\nAddress 0-1 (hotel dweller) stays because 1-0-0-0-1 moves to room 10,001.\nand so on.\nInfinite layers of nesting.\nEach pod holds 10 people.\nEach megapod holds 10 pods. (100 people)\nEach supermegapod holds 10 megapods. (1,000 people)\nEach superdupermegapod holds 10 supermegapods.\nEach ultrasuperdupermegapod holds 10 superdupermegapod.\nEach ultrasuperduperubermegapod holds 10 ultrasuperdupermegapods. (1,000,000 people)\nAnd so on.\nThis assumes that there is never an infinitieth layer. (The main ship)\nAnalysis.\nHilbert's paradox is a veridical paradox: it leads to a counter-intuitive result that is provably true. The statements \"there is a guest to every room\" and \"no more guests can be accommodated\" are not equivalent when there are infinitely many rooms. An analogous situation is presented in Cantor's diagonal proof.\nAt first, this state of affairs might seem to be counter-intuitive. The properties of \"infinite collections of things\" are quite different from those of \"finite collections of things\". The paradox of Hilbert's Grand Hotel can be understood by using Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers. In an ordinary (finite) hotel with more than one room, the number of odd-numbered rooms is obviously smaller than the total number of rooms. However, in Hilbert's aptly named Grand Hotel, the quantity of odd-numbered rooms is not smaller than the total \"number\" of rooms. In mathematical terms, the cardinality of the subset containing the odd-numbered rooms is the same as the cardinality of the set of all rooms. Indeed, infinite sets are characterized as sets that have proper subsets of the same cardinality. For countable sets (sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers) this cardinality is formula_1.\nPut differently, for any countably infinite set, there exists a bijective function which maps the countably infinite set to the set of natural numbers, even if the countably infinite set contains the natural numbers. For example, the set of rational numbers\u2014those numbers which can be written as a quotient of integers\u2014contains the natural numbers as a subset, but is no bigger than the set of natural numbers since the rationals are countable: there is a bijection from the naturals to the rationals."}

What they originally wanted to say was that an idea is so specific as to be unique, that it cannot really be part of a broader concept.\nLaw.\nWhen lawyers talk about something being \"sui generis\", they mean that something is unique.

There were also female demons, called succubi. They lay on sleeping people, to have sexual intercourse with them. They would also do this to make other incubi. While they had sex with their victim, they drained its energy to sustain themselves. Sometimes, having sex with an incubus may result in a child, as in the legend of Merlin. Some sources say that the incubus may be identified by its unnaturally cold penis. Religious tradition holds that repeated intercourse with such a spirit by either males or females may result in bad health, or even death.\nOrigins of the legends.\nPeople have come up with different explanations for the incubus legends. In the Middle Ages, people worried a lot about sin, especially sexual sins of women. Victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or sleep paralysis. Also, nocturnal arousal, orgasm or nocturnal emission could be explained by the idea of creatures causing an otherwise guilt-producing and self-conscious behavior. The influence of incubi could also have been used to explain how pregnancies happen outside marriage; such pregnancies were often \"unexplainable\".and unnoticed \nVictims who claimed to have fallen prey to the influence of incubi, could in reality have been victims of sexual assault by a real person. Rapists may have attributed the rapes of sleeping women to demons in order to escape punishment. A friend or relative may have assaulted the victim in her sleep. The victims and, in some cases the clergy, may have found it easier to explain the attack as supernatural in origin rather than confront the idea that the attack came from a trusted person.\nAncient and religious descriptions.\nOne of the earliest mentions of an incubus comes from Mesopotamia on the Sumerian kings' list, ca. 2400, where the hero Gilgamesh's father is listed as Lilu (Lila). It is said that Lilu disturbs and seduces women in their sleep, while Lilitu, a female demon, appears to men in their erotic dreams. Two other demons appear as well: Ardat lili visits men by night and bears ghostly children from them. Irdu lili, is the male counterpart to Ardat lili. He visits women by night. These demons were originally storm demons. Because the etymology was interpreted wrongly, they were later seen as night demons. Also considered to be vampires which is another form of a demon that is said to drink blood from its victims.\nIncubi and succubi were said by some not to be different sexes, but the same demon able to change its sex. A succubus would be able to sleep with a man and collect his sperm, and then transform into an incubus and use that seed on women. Their offspring were thought to be supernatural in many cases, even if the actual genetic material originally came from humans.\nMany tales claim that the incubus is bisexual, but some indicate that it is strictly heterosexual and finds attacking a male victim either unpleasant or detrimental. There are also many stories involving the attempted exorcism of incubi or succubi who have taken refuge in the bodies of men or women.\nIncubi are sometimes said to be able to conceive children. The half-human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a cambion. The most famous legend of such a case includes that of Merlin, the famous wizard from Arthurian legend.\nAccording to the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", exorcism is one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of Incubi, the others being Sacramental Confession, the Sign of the Cross (or recital of the Angelic Salutation), moving the afflicted to another location, and by excommunication of the attacking entity, \"which is perhaps the same as exorcism.\" On the other hand, the Franciscan friar Ludovico Maria Sinistrari stated that incubi \"do not obey exorcists, have no dread of exorcisms, show no reverence for holy things, at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed.\""}

It took place from 4 June 1942 to 7 June 1942. This was about a month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, and six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nThe United States Navy defeated a Japanese attack against Midway Atoll (northwest of Hawaii) and destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser.\nThe battle was a decisive victory for the Americans. It was the most important naval battle of the Pacific area in World War II. The battle weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy for the rest of the war. Japan could not build up its forces again. The United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly. Japan could only make a few poor quality replacements.\nThe Japanese planned to bring America's carriers into a trap and sink them. The Japanese also tried to take Midway Atoll to build defenses far from their homeland and prepare to invade Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii.\nThe Midway operation, like the attack on Pearl Harbor, was made to destroy the American strength in the Pacific Ocean. This way, Japan could become the biggest power in the area and unify Asia under its control. It was also hoped that another defeat would force the U.S. to ask for peace soon.\nAfter the defeat, Imperial Japanese Navy forces retired. Japan lost four out of their six carriers, and hundreds of their best air pilots. This stopped the expansion of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific, and the Americans began to slowly advance towards Japan.\nBackground.\nJapan had reached its first goals quickly, taking the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). This gave Japan petroleum, which it needed to make more war. Planning for a second part of the operations started in January 1942. However, disagreements between the Imperial Army and Imperial Navy, and among naval commanders, prevented finishing the plan until April 1942. Admiral Yamamoto said he would quit if his plan for the Central Pacific was not accepted. It was accepted.\nYamamoto's main goal was to destroy America's carrier forces, which he saw as the main threat to the Pacific campaign. This concern was increased by the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. In this raid, 16 US Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bombers launched from bombed targets in Tokyo and several other Japanese cities. The raid, while militarily unimportant, showed that American bombers could reach Japanese territory. This and other successful raids by American carriers showed that they were still a threat.\nYamamoto thought that another attack on the U.S Naval base at Pearl Harbor would make all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, because of the many American land-based airplanes on Hawaii, he thought that it was too risky to attack directly. Instead, he decided to attack Midway, a tiny atoll at the northwest end of the Hawaiian Island chain, approximately from Oahu. The Japanese didn't need Midway but they felt the Americans would try hard to defend it.\nThe U.S. did consider Midway to be important. After the battle, they set up a submarine base on Midway. That meant submarines operating from Pearl Harbor could refuel and get new supplies, so they could go farther west. Midway's airstrips were also used for bomber attacks on Wake Island.\nYamamoto's plan: Operation MI.\nLike most Japanese naval planning during World War II, Yamamoto's battle plan was very complex. His was also based on incorrect (wrong) information. He thought that and were the only carriers available to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In May 1942, during the Battle of the Coral Sea, had been sunk and so badly damaged that the Japanese thought she had been sunk. The Japanese also knew that was being repaired on the US West Coast after getting torpedo damage from a submarine. and were in the Atlantic, but the Japanese were not sure this was so.\nYamamoto thought that the Americans had been demoralized by their defeats in the last six months. He thought a trick would lure the U.S. fleet into a dangerous situation. He spread out his ships, especially his battleships, so that they would be hard to find. Yamamoto's battleships and cruisers went behind Vice-Admiral Ch\u016bichi Nagumo's carrier force by several hundred miles. Japan's heavy surface forces would wait for the U.S. ships to come to defend Midway, and destroy them.\nThe plan was for Nagumo's carriers to cause so much harm to US ships that the Japanese could fire on them by daylight.\nYamamoto did not know that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code. Yamamoto's choice to spread out his ships meant that none of his groups of ships could support each other. The only warships larger than the 12 destroyers that protected Nagumo's fleet were two battleships, two heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser.\nAleutian invasion.\nThe Japanese attacks in the Aleutian Islands (Operation AL) took away yet more ships that could have attacked Midway. Many histories once saw the Aleutians attack as a feint to draw American forces away. Early twenty-first century research shows that AL was supposed to be launched at the same time as the attack on Midway. However, a one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's ships resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before the Midway attack.\nPrelude to battle.\nAmerican reinforcements.\nTo battle with an enemy expected to have four or five carriers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every U.S. carrier he could get. He already had Vice Admiral William Halsey's two-carrier (\"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\") force. Halsey was sick with psoriasis and had to be replaced by Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Nimitz also called back Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's force, including the carrier \"Yorktown\" (which had major damage at Coral Sea), from the South West Pacific Area. It reached Pearl Harbor just in time to sail.\nThe damaged \"Yorktown\" however, was not completely crippled. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked all day and all night, and in 72\u00a0hours she was ready to battle for two or three weeks. Her flight deck was patched, sections of internal frames were replaced, and several squadrons of aircraft were taken from \"Saratoga\". The pilots did not get time to train. Repairs on Yorktown continued even as she sailed out.\nOn Midway, by 4 June the USN had stationed four groups of PBYs\u201431 aircraft in total\u2014for long-range reconnaissance duties, and six new Grumman TBF-1 Avengers. The Avengers were taken from \"Hornet\"s VT-8. The Marine Corps had 19 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses, seven Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats, 17 Vought SB2U-3 Vindicators, and 21 Brewster F2A-3s. The USAAF sent a group of 17 B-17 Flying Fortresses and eight B-26 Marauders with torpedoes: in total 126 aircraft.\nJapanese shortcomings.\nDuring the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier, the Japanese light carrier \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" had been sunk and the fleet carrier had three bomb hits, and was in drydock undergoing repairs. Although the carrier was undamaged, she had lost almost half her airplanes and was in port in Kure awaiting new planes and pilots. No new pilots were available because none had been trained. Flight instructors were used in an effort to make up the missing aircrew.\nJapan's two most advanced aircraft carriers were not available and Admiral Nagumo would therefore have only four fleet carriers: and ; and . At least part of this was due to overwork; Japanese carriers had been constantly operating since 7 December 1941, including raids on Darwin and Colombo.\nThe main Japanese carrier-based aircraft were the Aichi D3A1 dive bomber and the Nakajima B5N2, which was used either as a torpedo bomber or as a bomber. However, production of the D3A had been reduced, while production of the B5N had been stopped. None were available to replace losses. In addition many of the aircraft being used during the June 1942 operations had been operating since late November 1941; many were almost worn out and had become increasingly unreliable. These factors meant that all carriers of the \"Kido Butai\" had fewer aircraft than normal and there were not enough spare aircraft or parts. I\nJapan's main carrier fighter was the fast Mitsubishi A6M2 \"Zero\".\nJapanese scouting before the battle was disorganized. A line of Japanese submarines was late getting into position. This let the American carriers reach their meeting point northeast of Midway (known as \"Point Luck\") without being found by the subs. A second attempt at scouting, using four-engine Kawanishi H8K flying boats to fly to Pearl Harbor prior to the battle and see whether the American carriers were there did not work out because Japanese subs could not refuel the planes. Japan did not know where the American carriers were before the battle.\nJapanese radios did pick up more American submarine activity and messages. Yamamoto knew this before the battle, but Japanese plans were not changed. Yamamoto, at sea on , assumed that Nagumo had received the same message from Tokyo, and he did not send the message, because he did not want the US to hear the message. Nagumo's radio antennas could not get the message from Tokyo.\nAllied code-breaking.\nAdmiral Nimitz had one advantage: code experts had broken the Japanese Navy's JN-25b code. Since the early spring of 1942, the US had been decoding messages stating that there would soon be an operation at objective \"AF\". They guessed that it was Midway and sent an uncoded radio message that Midway needed fresh water. The code breakers then picked up a Japanese message that \"AF was short on water.\" was also able to determine the date of the attack as either 4 or 5 June, and to tell Nimitz exactly which Japanese ships were coming. Japan had a new codebook, but it was not used for several days. The new code, which had not yet been figured out, was used shortly before the attack began, but the important information had already been figured out.\nAmericans knew where, when, and in what strength the Japanese would arrive at Midway. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had ruined their advantage in number of ships by dividing their ships into four groups, all too separated to be able to support each other. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained almost totally unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.\nBattle.\nInitial air attacks.\nAt about 09:00 on 3 June, a US Navy patrol plane spotted the Japanese Occupation Force to the west-southwest of Midway. Three hours later, the Americans found the Japanese transport group to the west. They attacked, but none of the bombs hit and no major damage resulted. Early the following morning the Japanese oil tanker \"Akebono Maru\" was hit by a torpedo from an attacking PBY. This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the entire battle.\nAt 04:30 on 4 June, Nagumo launched his attack on Midway. It consisted of 36 dive bombers 36 torpedo bombers, escorted by 36 Mitsubishi Zero fighters. At the same time he launched a defensive combat air patrol. His eight search planes launched 30\u00a0minutes late.\nJapanese reconnaissance plans were poor, with too few aircraft to cover the search areas. Yamamoto's decisions had now become a serious problem.\nAs Nagumo's bombers and fighters were taking off, 11 PBYs were leaving Midway to search for Japanese ships. They reported sighting two Japanese carriers with empty decks, which meant an air strike was on its way. American radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles, and planes were sent off to defend Midway. Bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet. US fighters remained behind to defend Midway. At 06:20 Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base. Midway-based Marine fighter pilots, flying F4Fs and obsolescent F2As, intercepted the Japanese and had many losses. Most of the U.S. planes were shot down in the first few minutes; several were damaged, and only two could fly. In all, 3 F4Fs and 13 F2As were shot down. American anti-aircraft fire was accurate damaging many Japanese aircraft and destroying four.\nOf the 108 Japanese aircraft involved in this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged. The initial Japanese attack did not destroy Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force. Most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Another air attack to destroy Midway's defences would be necessary if troops were to be able to go ashore by 7 June.\nAmerican bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet. These included six Grumman Avengers from the s VT-8 (Midway was the first combat mission for the VT-8 airmen, and it was the first combat of the TBF), Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 241 (VMSB-241), consisting of eleven SB2U-3s and sixteen SBDs, plus four USAAF B-26s, armed with torpedoes, and fifteen B-17s. The Japanese fought off these attacks. The US lost two fighters, five TBFs, two SB2Us, eight SBDs and two B-26s.\nOne B-26, after being seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, dove straight toward the \"Akagi\". The plane just missed the carrier's bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff. This may have made Nagumo decide to launch another attack on Midway, against Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve force for anti-ship operations.\nNagumo's decision.\nAdmiral Nagumo had kept half of his aircraft in reserve. These were two squadrons of dive bombers and torpedo bombers. At 07:15 Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with bombs for use against land targets. At 07:40 a scout plane from \"Tone\" saw a big American naval force to the east. It seems that Nagumo did not receive the report until 08:00. Nagumo reversed his order, but it took 40\u00a0minutes before \"Tone\"'s scout finally radioed that there was a carrier in the American force. This was one of the carriers from TF 16; the other carrier was not sighted.\nNagumo was now unsure of what to do. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi recommended that Nagumo strike with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A dive bombers each on \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and \"Hiry\u016b\", and half the cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships, however, was now limited. The Midway strike force would be returning shortly and needed to land or crash into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity, the Japanese did not get their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch. The few aircraft that were ready were defensive Fighter aircraft. Launching aircraft would have required at least 30 to 45\u00a0minutes. By launching right away, Nagumo would be using some of his reserve without proper anti-ship weapons. He had just seen how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down. Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers to get rid of their bombs and attempt to fight intercepting F4Fs. Japanese carrier rules preferred full strikes, and since Nagumo did not know the American force included a carrier, his response followed Japanese rules. In addition, the arrival of another American air strike at 07:53 made Nagumo want to attack the island again. Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be armed and ready.\nFletcher's carriers had launched their planes beginning at 07:00, so the aircraft that attacked Nagumo were already on their way. There was nothing Nagumo could do about it. This was the flaw with Yamamoto's plans.\nAttacks on the Japanese fleet.\nThe Americans had already launched their carrier aircraft against the Japanese. Admiral Fletcher, in command aboard \"Yorktown\", and having PBY sighting reports from the early morning, ordered an attack on the Japanese as soon as possible. He held \"Yorktown\" in reserve in case any other Japanese carriers were found. (Fletcher's directions to Spruance were sent by Nimitz, who had remained ashore.)\nSpruance thought that even though the range was far, an attack could succeed. He gave the order to launch the attack at around 06:00. Fletcher, upon completing his own scouting flights, followed at 08:00 from \"Yorktown\".\nAdmiral Fletcher, commanding the \"Yorktown\" task force, along with Captain Elliott Buckmaster,\"Yorktown\"s commanding officer, and their staffs had experience in doing a full strike against an enemy force in the Coral Sea. But they could not pass on what they had learned to \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\" which were ordered to launch the first strike. Spruance ordered the aircraft to go to the target right away, since destroying enemy carriers was important to the safety of his ships. Spruance decided it was more important to attack as soon as possible, rather than coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). American squadrons went to the target in several different groups. He hoped that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks full of planes.\nAmerican carrier aircraft had difficulty locating the target. The strike from \"Hornet\", led by Commander Stanhope C. Ring, did not fly in the right direction. Air Group Eight's dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers. Torpedo Squadron 8 flew in the correct direction. However, the 10 F4Fs from \"Hornet\" had run out of fuel and had to crash into the ocean. Waldron's squadron saw the enemy carriers and began attacking at 09:20, followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from \"Enterprise\") whose Wildcat fighter escorts also ran low on fuel and had to turn back at 09:40. Without fighter escort, all fifteen TBD Devastators of VT-8 were shot down without being able to do any damage, with Ensign George Gay the only survivor. VT-6 lost 10 of their 14 Devastators, and 10 of \"Yorktown's\" VT-3's 12 Devastators were shot down with no hits. Part of the problem was the poor performance of the Mark 13 torpedoes. Senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never asked why six torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no hits. The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros shot down the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs managed to get close enough to drop their torpedoes and shoot their machine guns at the enemy ships. This made the Japanese carriers to make sharp turns. The TBD Devastator was never again used in combat.\nDespite their failure to get any hits, the American torpedo attacks made the Japanese carriers unable to prepare and launch their own strike. They also pulled the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) out of position. As well, many Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3 from \"Yorktown\") at 10:00 made the Japanese CAP fly to the southeast corner of the fleet. Better discipline and using more Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent the damage caused by the coming American attacks.\nThree squadrons of SBDs from \"Enterprise\" and \"Yorktown\" (VB-6, VS-6 and VB-3, respectively) were approaching from the southwest and northeast. The two squadrons from \"Enterprise\" were running low on fuel because of the time spent looking for the enemy. However, the squadron commander decided to continue the search. He spotted the Japanese destroyer \"Arashi\". It was moving to rejoin Nagumo's carriers after having unsuccessfully depth-charged U.S. submarine . Nautilus had earlier unsuccessfully attacked the battleship . Some bombers were lost from lack of fuel before the attack started.\nMcClusky's decision to continue the search was a great help to the US carrier task force and the forces at Midway. All three American dive-bombers squadrons (VB-6, VS-6 and VB-3) arrived at the right time to attack. Most of the Japanese CAP were looking for the torpedo planes. Armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks, fuel hoses lay on the decks and bombs and torpedoes were near the hangars, making the Japanese carriers very at risk of being damaged.\nBeginning at 10:22, the two squadrons of \"Enterprise\"s air group split up and attacked two targets. By accident, both groups attacked the \"Kaga\". Lieutenant Commander Richard Halsey Best and two other planes headed north to attack \"Akagi\". Coming under an attack from almost two full squadrons, \"Kaga\" was hit by four or five bombs, which caused heavy damage and starting fires that could not be put out. One of the bombs landed near the bridge, killing most of the senior officers.\nSeveral minutes later, Best and two planes dove on the \"Akagi\". Although \"Akagi\" getting one direct hit (dropped by Lieutenant Commander Best). It struck the deck elevator and went all the way through to the upper hangar deck. It exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft. Another bomb exploded underwater which bent the flight deck and caused rudder damage.\n\"Yorktown\"s VB-3, commanded by Max Leslie, attacked \"S\u014dry\u016b\". They got at least three hits and caused a lot of damage. VT-3 targeted \"Hiry\u016b\", but got no hits.\nWithin six minutes, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and \"Kaga\" were on fire. \"Akagi\" was also seriously damaged. The Japanese hoped that \"Akagi\" could be saved or towed back to Japan. Eventually, all three carriers were eventually abandoned and sunk.\nJapanese counterattacks.\n\"Hiry\u016b\", the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier attacked. \"Hiry\u016b\"'s first attack consisted of 18 dive bombers and six fighter escorts. They followed the retreating American aircraft and attacked the \"Yorktown\", hitting her with three bombs, which blew a hole in the deck, put out her boilers, and destroyed several anti-aircraft guns. Despite the damage, repair teams were able to fix the flight deck and fix several boilers in an hour. Twelve Japanese dive bombers and four escorting fighters were lost in this attack.\nApproximately one hour later, \"Hiry\u016b\"'s second attack was made. It consisted of ten torpedo bombers and six escorting A6Ms. The US repair efforts had been so well done that the Japanese assumed she must be a different, undamaged carrier. In the attack, \"Yorktown\" was struck by two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a tilt to port, which put her out of action. Admiral Fletcher moved his command staff to the heavy cruiser . Neither of the carriers of Spruance's Task Force 16 was damaged.\nNews of the two strikes, with the reports each had sunk an American carrier (actually \"Yorktown\" in both cases), greatly improved morale in the \"Kido Butai\". Its few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard \"Hiry\u016b\" where they were prepared for an attack against what was believed to be the only remaining American carrier.\nAmerican counterattack.\nLate in the afternoon, a \"Yorktown\" scout aircraft located \"Hiry\u016b\". \"Enterprise\" launched a strike of dive bombers (including 10 SBDs from \"Yorktown\"). Despite \"Hiry\u016b\" being defended by more than a dozen Zero fighters, the attack by \"Enterprise\" was successful: four, possibly five bombs hit \"Hiry\u016b\", leaving her on fire and unable to operate aircraft. (\"Hornet\"s strike aimed at the escort ships but it did not get any hits.) After hopeless attempts to control the fire, most of the crew remaining on \"Hiry\u016b\" were taken off the ship. The rest of the fleet continued sailing northeast to catch the American carriers. \"Hiry\u016b\" stayed afloat for several more hours. She was discovered by an aircraft from the light carrier \"H\u014dsh\u014d\". This led to hopes she could be saved or towed back to Japan. However, soon after being spotted, \"Hiry\u016b\" sank. Rear Admiral Yamaguchi chose to go down with his ship, costing Japan her best carrier officer.\nAs darkness fell, both sides thought about the situation and made plans for action. Admiral Fletcher had to abandon the \"Yorktown\". He felt he could not command from a cruiser. He gave command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, but he was still unsure of what Japanese forces remained. He wanted to protect Midway and his carriers. He followed Nagumo during the day and continued to follow as night fell. Finally, fearing a possible night battle with Japanese ships and believing Yamamoto still intended to invade, Spruance pulled back to the east. He turned back west towards the enemy at midnight. Yamamoto decided to continue the attacks and sent his remaining ships searching eastward for the American carriers. He also sent a cruiser raiding force to bomb the island. The Japanese ships failed to make contact with the Americans due to Spruance's decision to pull back eastward, and Yamamoto ordered a withdrawal to the west. \nSpruance failed to regain contact with Yamamoto's forces on 5 June even though he made many searches. Towards the end of the day he launched an attack on any ships from Nagumo's carrier force. This strike missed Yamamoto's main group of ships. It did not hit a Japanese destroyer. The strike planes returned to the carriers after nightfall. Spruance to ordered \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\" to turn on their lights to aid the landings.\nAt 02:15 on the night of 5/6 June, Commander John Murphy's , in the water west of Midway, made the second of the submarine force's major contributions to the battle's outcome. Sighting several ships, neither Murphy nor his executive officer, Ray Spruance, Jr., could identify them. Considering that they might be US ships, Murphy did not fire, but reported the ships to Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC). This report was sent to Nimitz, who then sent it to Spruance. Spruance assumed this was the invasion force and moved to block it while staying northeast of Midway.\nThe ships sighted by \"Tambor\" were the four cruisers and two destroyers Yamamoto had sent to bomb Midway. At 02:55 these ships received Yamamoto's order to pull back and changed course. At about the same time as the course change, \"Tambor\" was sighted, and to avoid a submarine attack and hit into each other, causing serious damage to \"Mogami\"s bow. The less severely damaged \"Mikuma\" slowed to . This was the most damage any of the 18 submarines deployed for the battle achieved. Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was hazardous, and he dived to approach for an attack. The attack was unsuccessful, and at around 06:00 he finally reported two westbound \"Mogami\"-class cruisers.\nOver the following two days, first Midway and then Spruance's carriers launched several attacks. \"Mikuma\" was sunk by Dauntlesses, while \"Mogami\" survived damage and returned home for repairs. The destroyers \"Arashio\" and \"Asashio\" were also bombed and machine-gunned during the last of these attacks.\nThe \"Yorktown\" was towed by USS \"Vireo\". In the late afternoon of 6 June, however, fired torpedoes; two struck \"Yorktown\", but a third struck and sank destroyer , which had been providing power to \"Yorktown\". \"Hammann\" broke in two with the loss of 80 lives. \"Yorktown\" sank just after 05:00 on 7 June.\nJapanese casualties.\nBy the time the battle ended, 3,057 Japanese had died. Casualties aboard the four carriers were:\n\"Akagi\": 267; \"Kaga\": 811; \"Hiryu\": 392; \"Soryu\": 711; a total of 2,181. The heavy cruisers \"Mikuma\" (sunk; 700 casualties) and \"Mogami\" (badly damaged; 92) accounted for another 792 deaths.\nIn addition, the destroyers \"Arashio\" (bombed; 35) and \"Asashio\" (strafed by aircraft; 21) were both damaged during the air attacks which sank \"Mikuma\" and caused further damage to \"Mogami\". Floatplanes were lost from the cruisers \"Chikuma\" (3) and \"Tone\" (2). Dead aboard the destroyers \"Tanikaze\" (11), \"Arashi\" (1), \"Kazagumo\" (1) and the fleet oiler \"Akebono Maru\" (10) made up the remaining 23 casualties.\nAftermath.\nAfter winning a victory, and as pursuing the Japanese ships became too dangerous near Wake, The American forces pulled back. Spruance pulled back to the east to refuel his destroyers and meet with the carrier \"Saratoga\", which was carrying replacement aircraft. The American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor. Historian Samuel E. Morison wrote in 1949 that Spruance was criticized for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, allowing their fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance followed Yamamoto, he would have been unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruiser escorts would have been destroyed by Yamamoto's larger and more powerful ships, including the battleship , with 18-inch guns.\nOn 10 June, the Japanese Navy gave an account of the results of the battle that did not tell the whole story. Nagumo's battle report was given to the high command on 15 June. It was intended only for the highest officers in the Japanese Navy and government. It was guarded closely throughout the war. Nagumo stated that the enemy was not aware of our plans. The Japanese public, and much of the military, were not told about the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy officers were told about the carrier and pilot losses. Army planners continued to believe that the fleet was in good condition.\nOn the return of the Japanese fleet to Hashirajima on 14 June the wounded were transferred to naval hospitals. Most were called \"secret patients\" and kept away from other patients and their families. The Navy did this to keep this major defeat secret. The remaining officers and men were quickly spread out to other units of the fleet and sent to the South Pacific, where the majority were killed. None of the flag officers or staff of the Combined Fleet was penalized, with Nagumo later being placed in command of the rebuilt carrier force.\nThe Japanese Navy learned some lessons from Midway. Aircraft were refueled and re-armed on the flight deck, rather than in the hangars. All unused fuel lines were drained. The new carriers being built with only two flight deck elevators and new firefighting equipment. More carrier crew members were trained in damage-control and firefighting techniques. The losses later in the war of , ', and ' showed that there were still problems in this area. Replacement pilots went through a short training program, meeting the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a decline in the quality of training. These inexperienced pilots were sent into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were kept flying continually. As a result, Japanese naval air groups declined in quality during the war.\nWar crimes.\nThree U.S. airmen, Ensign Wesley Osmus (pilot, \"Yorktown\"), Ensign Frank O'Flaherty (pilot, \"Enterprise\") and Aviation Machinist's Mate B. F. (or B. P.) Bruno Gaido (radioman-gunner of O'Flaherty's SBD) were captured by the Japanese during the battle. Osmus was held on the \"Arashi\", with O'Flaherty and Gaido on the cruiser \"Nagara\" (or destroyer \"Makigumo\", sources vary), and later killed. O'Flaherty and Gaido were tied to five-gallon kerosene cans filled with water and dumped overboard several days after the battle.\nImpact.\nThe Battle of Midway has been called \"the turning point of the Pacific\". However, even after Midway, the Japanese continued to try to get more territory in the South Pacific. The U.S. did not become the more powerful navy until after several more months of hard combat. Midway was the Allies' first major victory against the Japanese.\nHowever, it did not change the course of the war by itself. It was the combined effects of the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway that reduced Japan's ability to do major attacks. In addition Midway helped make US landings on Guadalcanal possible. The prolonged attrition warfare (a type of battle in which each side tries to wear down the other side) of the Solomon Islands campaign allowed the Allies to take an offensive stance for the rest of the Pacific War. Finally, Midway bought the United States time until the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942.\nThe battle also showed the worth of pre-war naval code breaking and intelligence-gathering. These efforts continued in both the Pacific and Atlantic areas of war. There were many successes. Navy code breaking made possible the shooting down of Admiral Yamamoto's airplane.\nSome authors have stated heavy losses in carriers and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully, however, have stated that the losses in veteran aircrew, while heavy (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers), were not as bad for the Japanese naval air-corps as a whole. The Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew at the start of the Pacific war. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates at both the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of Santa Cruz. It was these battles, combined with the constant death of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which weakened Japan. However, the loss of four large fleet carriers, and over 40% of the carriers' aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the flight-deck crews were very damaging to the Japanese carrier fleet. After the battle and were the only large carriers of the original Pearl Harbor strike-force left for offensive actions. Of Japan's other carriers, was the only Fleet carrier that could be used with \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\", while , , and , were second-rate ships. By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, while the Japanese had somewhat rebuilt their carrier forces, the planes were flown by inexperienced pilots. \nIn the time it took Japan to build three carriers, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers, and numerous escort carriers. By 1942 the United States was already three years into a shipbuilding plan which aimed make the navy larger than Japan's. The greater number of USN aviators survived the Battle of Midway and subsequent battles of 1942, and combined with growing pilot training programs, the US had many skilled pilots.\nCodebreaking success.\nYamamoto did not know that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code (JN-25). This let the U.S. fleet go to the right place at the right time.\nYamamoto scattered his forces to keep the attack secret, but that meant his formations could not help each other. For instance, Nagumo's fleet had few big ships. When the carrier planes were carrying out the strikes, the carriers were relatively undefended. By contrast, the flotillas of Yamamoto and Kondo had more big ships, \"none of which saw any action at Midway\". Their distance from Nagumo's carriers also meant he could not use their reconnaissance planes, so he knew little of what was happening."}

It is also used for sails, bellows, skin boats, banners and other items shaped out of flexible materials.\n\"Fancy\" sewing is done to decorate materials, such as embroidery or quilting.\nSewing is an important part of shoemaking and bookbinding. Wounds are often sewn shut.\nIf a thread becomes loose in a sewn item, the stitches may unravel and require restitching to repair them. In repair sewing, pulling the threaded needle in and out of the fabric at the same lengths and places as the other remaining stitches can make a repair nearly invisible. Replacing a missing button on a garment follows the same procedure, although there are different possible ways to place the thread to sew on a button. While repairs are usually sewn by hand, most garments are created using a machine, which can range from simple to complex."}

At first, the war was made up of two conflicts. One was mainly between Britain and France, and the other was between Prussia and its enemies: France, Austria, Russia, and Sweden.\nAn important cause of the war was the earlier War of the Austrian Succession.\nThe war was known by different names in different places. In the United States, it is called the French and Indian War. In French Canada, it is called the War of the Conquest. In both Sweden and Prussia, it was called the Pomeranian War. In India, it is known as the Third Carnatic War.\nAs for the conflict between Prussia and Austria, it is called the Third Silesian War.\nColonialism was common at the time. In the war, the trade interests of the British Empire were opposed to those of the Bourbons (in France and Spain). The Hohenzollerns (in Prussia) and the Habsburgs (Holy Roman Emperors and archdukes in Austria) fought each other, mainly over Silesia.\nA \"diplomatic revolution\" established an Anglo-Prussian camp that was allied with some smaller German states and later the Portuguese Empire. It fought an Austro-French camp that was allied with Sweden, Saxony and later Spain.\nResults.\nThe Russian Empire left its offensive alliance with the Habsburgs on the death of Empress Elizabeth and the succession of Peter III. Sweden also concluded a separate peace with Prussia in 1762.\nThe war ended with the peace treaties of Paris (France, Spain, Great Britain) and of Hubertusburg (Hohenzollerns, Habsburgs, Saxon elector) in 1763. The war had been characterized by sieges and arson of towns as well as open battles involving extremely-heavy losses; overall, some 900,000 to 1,400,000 people died.\nGreat Britain succeeded in the contested overseas territories, gaining the bulk of New France, Spanish Florida, some Caribbean islands, Senegal and superiority over the French outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The native American tribes were excluded from the peace settlement, and were unable to return to their former status after the resulting Pontiac's rebellion.\nIn Europe, Frederick II of Prussia failed to complete a preemptive strike against Austria, and his opponents repulsed and at Kunersdorf nearly destroyed his forces. Frederick however recovered, regained ground and managed to avoid any concessions in Hubertusburg, where the status quo ante bellum was restored. William Pitt's saying that \"America was won in Germany\" referred to the Prussian war effort, which enabled Great Britain to limit her continental commitments and focus on her \"blue water policy,\" successfully establishing naval supremacy. While French and allied forces were able to occupy Prussian and Hanoverian territories up to East Frisia, French ambitions to invade Britain and to continue with their guerre de course were thwarted by a British naval blockade, which also impaired French supply routes to the colonies.\nThe involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. Spain's short intervention resulted in the loss of Florida, though it gained French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River in exchange and Britain returned Cuba as well as the Philippines.\nThe Treaty of Paris (1763) ended the war for Britain and France."}

It took place on Okinawa Island in the Ryukyu Islands (south of the four big islands of Japan). The battle was between the military forces of the Empire of Japan and the Allies. It was the second biggest amphibious battle (from sea to land) of World War II, after the Battle of Normandy. It was also one of the longest battles in history, from April to June 1945. The Allies won the battle and occupied Okinawa. Today, Okinawa is Japanese territory, but there are still American military bases there.\nThe Battle of Okinawa is considered to be the last major battle of World War II. The Americans were planning Operation Downfall, the invasion of the four great islands of Japan. This never happened, since the Japanese surrendered after the American use of the atomic bomb in August 1945 (first in Hiroshima, and a second time in Nagasaki) and the Soviet Union declaring war on Japan.\nThe battle has been called \"Typhoon of Steel\" in English, and \"\"tetsu no ame,\" \"tetsu no b\u014df\u016b\"\" by the people of Okinawa, which mean \"rain of steel\" and \"violent wind of steel\", because of the very heavy firing of guns and bombs at this battle.\nSome battles, such as the Battle of Iwo Jima, had no civilians present, but Okinawa had a large civilian population. The civilians killed or injured in the battle were at least 150,000. American deaths were 18,900 killed or missing and 53,000 injured, more than double of the soldiers killed at Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal put together. Several thousand soldiers who died from wounds and other causes after the battle had finished, are not included. About a third of the civilian population of the island were killed.\nThere were about 100,000 Japanese soldiers killed and 7,000 captured. Some of the soldiers committed seppuku or simply blew themselves up with grenades. Some of the civilians, convinced by Japanese propaganda that the Americans were barbarians who did terrible things to prisoners, killed their families and themselves to avoid capture.\nIn 1945, Winston Churchill called the battle \"among the most intense and famous in military history.\"'\nOrder of battle.\nAllied.\nOverall Allied command authority for battle was Fifth Fleet (under Admiral Raymond A. Spruance). Fifth Fleet was divided into several task forces and groups.\nTF 56 was the largest force within TF 50 and was built around the 10th Army. The army had two corps under its command. In all, the Army had over 102,000 Army (of these 38,000+ were artillery, combat support and HQ troops, with another 9,000 service troops), over 88,000 Marines and 18,000 Navy personnel (mostly Seabees and medical personnel).\nAt the start of the Battle of Okinawa the 10th Army had 182,821 men under its command. The U.S. Navy had greater casualties in this operation than in any other battle of the war.\nJapanese.\nThe Japanese land campaign (mainly defensive) was had 67,000 men (77,000 according to some sources). As well, there were 9,000 Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base. There were also 39,000 local Ryukyuan people who were forced to fight.\nNaval battle.\nThe United States Navy's Task Force 58 was east of Okinawa. It had 6 to 8 destroyers and 13 carriers. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz gave his naval commanders time to rest.\nJapanese air attacks had been light during the first few days after the landings. However, on 6 April, there was an attack by 400 planes from Kyushu. From 26 March-30 April, 20 American ships were sunk and 157 damaged.\nThe Japanese had lost up to more than 1,100 planes in the battle.\nBetween 6 April and 22 June, the Japanese flew 1,465 \"kamikaze\" aircraft attacks. Several fleet carriers were severely damaged.\nOperation \"Ten-Go\".\nOperation \"Ten-Go\" (\"Ten-g\u014d sakusen\") was the attack by ten Japanese ships. In all, the Imperial Japanese Navy lost 3,700 sailors, including Admiral It\u014d. The US lost just 10 U.S. aircraft and 12 airmen.\nBritish Pacific Fleet.\nThe British Pacific Fleet was ordered to attack Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands.\nLand battle.\nThe land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on 1 April 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed west of Okinawa on 26 March.\nOn 31 March, Marines of the Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion landed without opposition on Keise Shima.\nNorthern Okinawa.\nThe main landing was made by XXIV Corps and III Amphibious Corps on the western coast of Okinawa on 1 April.\nThe 10th Army moved across the south-central part of the island. They captured the Kadena and the Yomitan airbases.\nSix days later on 13 April, the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Marine Regiment reached Hedo Point (Hedo-misaki) at the northern part of the island. Japanese forces in the north were on the Motobu Peninsula.\nThe 77th Infantry Division attacked Ie Island (Ie Shima) on 16 April.\nSouthern Okinawa.\nThe U.S. Army 96th Infantry division and 7th Infantry Division went south across Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division had violent fights with Japanese troops in fortified positions.\nThey had 1,500 battle casualties, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese.\nThe next American goal was Kakazu Ridge. The Japanese soldiers hid in caves. There were many casualties on both sides.\nOn the evening of 12 April, the 32nd Army attacked U.S. positions. The attackers retreated. A final attack on 14 April was again stopped.\nThe launched a new attack on 19 April with 324 guns, the largest ever in the Pacific Ocean war. Then 650 Navy and Marine planes attacked with napalm, rockets, bombs, and machine guns.\nA tank attack failed with the loss of 22 tanks. XXIV Corps lost 720 men KIA, WIA and MIA.\nOn 4 May, the 32nd Army launched another attack. This time, Ushijima tried to land troops on the coasts behind American lines. Japanese artillery fired 13,000 rounds. The attack failed.\nBuckner launched another American attack on 11 May. By the end of May, monsoon rains turned hills and roads into mud.\nOn 29 May, Maj.\u00a0Gen. Pedro del Valle ordered Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines to capture Shuri Castle.\nThe Japanese retreat moved nearly 30,000 men into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors \u2014 including Admiral Minoru Ota \u2014 all committed suicide.\nOn 18 June, Gen. Buckner was killed by enemy artillery fire. The last Japanese stopped fighting on 21 June, although some Japanese stayed hidden."}

{"id": "69332", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69332", "title": "Bald eagle", "text": "The bald eagle (\"Latin name: Haliaeetus leucocephalus\") is a bird of prey that lives in North America. It is the national bird of the United States of America. The bald eagle is a kind of sea eagle. It can be found in most of Canada, all of the United States, and the northern part of Mexico. It lives near big areas of water, where there are trees to nest in and there is a lot of food to eat. It is called \"bald\" because of its white head and neck. (There is more information on the bald eagle's name in the section below called \"Name.\")\nThe species almost died in the United States (while its numbers were growing in Alaska and Canada) late in the 20th century. Now it has a more stable population.\nDescription.\nThe bald eagle is a large bird. It is usually as tall as and its wingspan is . Female eagles are about 25 percent larger than males. Adult females weigh , while males weigh . The adult bald eagle has a brown body, and its head and tail are white. It also has yellow feet with large talons, and a hooked yellow beak. The males and the females' wings have the same colors.\nBefore bald eagles become adults, their wings are brown. Their wings are usually speckled with white dots until the fifth year.\nThe size of the bird depends on where it lives. The smallest birds are in Florida, where an adult male is only about . The largest Bald Eagles are in Alaska, where large females may be as much as .\nThe bald eagle is closely related to a species called the golden eagle. The bald eagle is physically and mentally different from the golden eagle. The bald eagle has a bigger head and a bigger beak, and its legs do not have feathers. \nWhen bald eagles \"call,\" (make sounds), they chirp weakly and whistle. The young birds whistle more shrilly than adults.\nBald eagles usually live for around 20 years if they live in nature. The oldest ones sometimes live for 30 years. When bald eagles live in captivity, such as in zoos, they can live much longer.\nName.\nThis sea eagle gets both its common and scientific names from its head. \"Bald\" in the English name is from the word \"piebald\", which means, \"one with a white head\". The scientific name is from \"Haliaeetus\", which is Latin for \"sea eagle\".\nThe bald eagle was one of the many species written in Carolus Linnaeus's 18th century book \"Systema Naturae\". Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist, physician and zoologist who made the binomial nomenclature system.\nThere are two main subspecies of the bald eagle:\nHabitat.\nThe bald eagle's natural home is in most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the United States, and northern Mexico.\nThe most bald eagles live near seas, rivers, large lakes, oceans, and other large places with open water and a lot of fish.\nBald eagles need old trees with hard wood to live, sleep, and make nests. They like trees that have holes and are safe from predators. However, the height or kind of tree is not as important as its distance from a body of water. Bald eagles need to live near water.\nThe bald eagle does not like to be near humans. It is are found mostly in places where there are no humans, or very few of them. However, a few bald eagles live in places with trees inside of big cities. They may live in city parks. Bald eagles live in a city in Oregon. A family of bald eagles recently moved into Harlem, which is a place in the middle of New York city.\nBehavior.\nThe bald eagle flies very fast. It can move at speeds of 56\u201370 kilometers per hour (35\u201343\u00a0mph) when gliding or flapping its wings. However, when it is carrying fish, it flies about . Its dive speed is , though it does not dive a lot. The bald eagle is usually migratory, which means that it travels (migrates) between homes which are very far away from each other. In some places, bald eagles are not migratory. If a bald eagle's territory has water near by, it will remain there all year. But if the water where it lives freezes in the winter, it must migrate to the south or to the coast to find something to eat.\nDiet.\nThe bald eagle eats mostly fish. In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon are the main food of the Bald Eagle.\nSometimes, eagles may eat a lot of carrion, especially in winter. They will also scavenge dead bodies up to the size of whales. However, eagles eat more large dead fish than whales. They also sometimes eat the leftover food from campsites or garbage dumps. The mammals they eat include rabbits, hares, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, and deer fawns. Some of the birds they eat include grebes, ducks, gulls, and geese. Reptiles, amphibians and crustaceans (especially crabs) are also eaten.\nTo hunt fish the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have special things on their toes called \"spiricules\" that help them hold the fish more easily. Bald eagles have powerful talons. They have been seen flying with a 7\u00a0kg fawn. Sometimes, when the fish is too heavy, the eagle will be dragged into the water with it. Sometimes, eagles swim back to the shore and live, but sometimes they may drown or die because of hypothermia (a condition when one\u2019s body gets so cold the body temperature drops below normal). Other times, bald eagles steal fish and other kinds of food away from other animals. Healthy adult bald eagles are not eaten anywhere in the wild. This makes them thought as one of the top animals of the food chain.\nReproduction.\nBald eagles become adults when they are four or five years old. When they are old enough to mate, they usually come back to the place where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles mate for life. However, if one of the pair dies or disappears, the other will choose a new mate. A pair which can not get a chick after trying for a long time, may split up and look for new mates. When bald eagles court, they call and show their flying skills. When they do so, two mates may fly high, and then lock their talons together, and fall, parting again right before hitting the ground.\nThe nest of the bald eagle is larger than any other nest in North America. This is because it is used again and again, and every year more is added to the nest until it may soon become as large as deep, across and weigh 1 tonne. One nest in Florida was found to be deep, across, and to weigh . The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees near water. If there are no trees, the bald eagle will make its nest on the ground. Eagles have between one and three eggs per year. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs. The other parent will hunt for food or look for more to add onto the nest. The eggs are about long.\nRelationship with humans.\nFall and rise of population.\nOnce easily seen on the continental United States, the bald eagle was close to becoming extinct because of the use of the pesticide DDT. The DDT destroyed an adult bird's calcium, and it would become unable to lay more healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too weak to withstand the weight of its parents. In the early 1700s, the number of bald eagles were 300,000\u2013500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the United States.\nOther things that stopped bald eagles from producing well was the loss of habitat and illegal hunting of bald eagles. Also, oil and lead were other big reasons why bald eagles began to die out.\nThe species was first protected in the United States and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty. The 1940 Bald Eagle Protection Act in the United States also tried to stop the killing of the bald eagle and the golden eagle. The bald eagle was an endangered species in 1967, and the penalties for people who killed the species grew more and more. Also, in 1972, DDT was banned in the United States. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989.\nBecause of all this hard work, the bald eagle's population began to rise again. It was officially taken out from the United States list of endangered species on July 12, 1995.\nTo keep bald eagles in captivity, the workers had to be experienced in caring for eagles. The bald eagle can live a long time in captivity if well cared for, but does not mate well, even under the best care.\nThe national bird of the United States.\nThe bald eagle is the national bird of the United States. It appears on most of its seals, including the Seal of the President of the United States. The Continental Congress made the design for the Great Seal of the United States with a bald eagle holding thirteen arrows and an olive branch with thirteen leaves in its talons on June 20, 1782.\nThe bald eagle can be found on both national seals and on the back of several coins (including the quarter dollar coin until 1999). Between 1916 and 1945, the Flag of the President of the United States showed an eagle facing to its left.\nThere is a popular legend that Benjamin Franklin once supported the wild turkey as a symbol of the United States instead of the bald eagle. However, there is no evidence that this is true. The legend comes from the letter Franklin wrote to his daughter in 1784 from Paris. However, this letter was about the Society of the Cincinnati, and it did not say anything about the bald eagle or the wild turkey.\nIn Native American culture.\nThe Bald Eagle is a holy bird in some North American cultures. Its feathers are thought to be special. They are used very much in spiritual customs among the Native Americans. Eagles are thought as messengers between gods and humans. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional things, especially in fans. The Lakota people, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to a person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee people thought eagles as symbols of nature and fertility. This is because their nests are built high off the ground, and because they protect their young very bravely. The Choctaw explained that the bald eagle, who can see the sun more directly, is a symbol of peace.\nDuring the Sun Dance, which is danced by a lot of Native American tribes, the eagle is included in many different ways. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who need healing. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may send all the sick prayers to the god.\nHowever, Native American tribes cannot use bald or golden eagle feathers for their religious or spiritual use anymore. This is because of a law called the eagle feather law. The eagle feather law usually defends Native Americans by providing many exceptions to wildlife laws, but it presently does not yet allow Native American tribes to use them yet. This made the Native American groups angry because they insisted that it was stopping their ability to use their religion freely."}

It is similar to knitting, except that usually only one loop is active at one time, and that a crochet hook is used instead of knitting needles. Also, crochet can not be made by machine. Crochet uses more yarn than knitting but is faster to make by hand.\nCrochet is used to make clothing, household items like tablecloths, blankets and potholders, and toys. Lace is often made by crocheting, though it can be made by knitting and weaving as well.\nCrocheting is also a great craft for younger children. The stitches are easy and their small hands are able to hold the crochet hook. They are also able to see progress very quickly and that motivates them to continue. It is very easy to start again after setting the project down, which will help to keep young people involved in the craft.\nUS and UK Terminologies.\nThe US and the UK use different names for the same crochet stitches. If you are using a pattern, make sure you know if it uses US or UK terminology so you read it correctly.\nHere are the main differences."}

It is directed by Julie Taymor and written by Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement. The main characters are played by Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess. There are also other famous actors and singers who appear in the movie: Bono, who plays \"Dr. Robert\", Eddie Izzard as \"Mr. Kite\", Dana Fuchs as a musician called \"Sexy Sadie\", and Salma Hayek as a nurse.\nThe movie was released in North America on 12 October in 2007.\nPlot.\nThe story starts in the early 1960s. A young ship builder from Liverpool named Jude (played by Jim Sturgess) travels by ship to the United States in search of his American G.I. father called Wes (Played by Robert Clohessy). They have never met and his father does not know Jude exists. While looking for his father at Princeton, Jude makes friends with somebody called Max (Played by Joe Anderson), a rebellious young man from a rich background, and Max's sister Lucy (Played by Evan Rachel Wood). When Max drops out of college and moves to New York City, Jude goes with him. Max works as a taxi driver, while Jude tries to find work as an independent artist. They become roommates in a bohemian area of the city where they share an apartment with other people, including a woman called Sadie (Played by Dana Fuchs) who is their landlady and who is also trying to become singer. Other people who live in the same house include Jojo (Played by Martin Luther McCoy), a guitarist who arrives from Detroit after the death of his younger brother; and Prudence (Played by T.V. Carpio), a young lesbian who hitchhikes to New York City from Dayton, Ohio. Lucy joins them in the New York flat after her boyfriend is killed in the Vietnam War.\nLucy and Jude begin dating, as well as Sadie and Jojo, which leaves Prudence depressed. When Max is sent to Vietnam, Lucy becomes involved in an extreme anti-war group, which leads to tension with the non-political Jude. He is unhappy with the amount of time she spends with the political group, suspecting that its leader, Paco (Logan Marshall-Green), is a man who obsessively seduces and deceives women. Jude's art and his relationship with Lucy both start to break down. Meanwhile, Sadie has formed a band called Sadie and the Po Boys, with Jojo as her lead guitarist. She gains the attention of a manager (James Urbaniak) who signs her to a record label, but he wants her to drop her backing band. This leads to a break up between Sadie and Jojo, both musically and romantically.\nThe differences between Jude and Lucy grow. One day, Jude goes into the offices of the political group where Lucy works and is kicked out after punching Paco. This causes a fight between the couple, resulting in Lucy leaving Jude. Jude finds her at an anti-war demonstration at Columbia University during which many protesters, including Lucy, are arrested. When trying to help her, Jude is also arrested. Though Wes (Jude's Father) persuades the police not to take further action for activity at the protest, he cannot prove that Jude is his son, and Jude is sent back to England.\nMax is wounded in Vietnam and is emotionally and mentally troubled by his war experience, while Lucy remains involved in her anti-war group that is becoming more and more violent. After Lucy goes to the old headquarters of her anti-war group, she discovers Paco and some of his followers making bombs. She then decides to leave the group. One of Paco's bombs explodes, destroying the building. Jude reads about the explosion in a Liverpool newspaper and is concerned that Lucy has died. He then hears from Max that she is alive, and he arranges to return to the United States properly and without breaking the law. He meets Max, who drives him to Sadie's music headquarters where a Beatles-style rooftop concert is being held by Jojo, Sadie, and their band singing an anti-war song (Don't let me down). Lucy is supposed to be there to meet Jude again, but no one can find her, and the group is forced to leave when the police arrive. But Jude manages to sneak back onto the roof and begins to sing \"All you need is Love\", his eyes searching the crowd for Lucy. The rest of the band sneaks back onto the roof, too and they join him with their voices and instruments. Jude smiles sadly and turns to leave the roof, but Max suddenly points as they sing, and Jude turns to see Lucy standing on the roof across the street, singing along. They smile at one another with tears in their eyes, and the screen fades out to white clouds and blue sky.\nMovie soundtrack.\nThe movie's end credits show that a total of thirty-three separate Beatles songs featured in the movie, either in full or in part. All of these songs were written between 1963 and 1970 by the members of The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) and recorded by The Beatles. Thirty of them are songs that are officially credited to the songwriting partnership of Lennon-McCartney. Three are credited to George Harrison. One title (\"Flying\") is a 1967 song credited to all four members of the Beatles (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey).\nThirty-one of the soundtrack's songs feature vocals. Two of them (\"And I Love Her\" and \"A Day in the Life\") are brief instrumental versions of songs that were originally written with lyrics. One song (\"Flying\") was originally written as an instrumental.\nTwenty-five of the vocal tracks are performed by one or more of the six lead cast members. Four of the songs are sung by stars with cameo roles (Bono, Eddie Izzard, Salma Hayek and Joe Cocker). One song (\"Let It Be\") is sung by supporting members of the cast. One song (\"Blue Jay Way\") is sung by indie Texan trio The Secret Machines. In twenty-nine of the vocal tracks, the vocalists are singing on-screen. Two of the vocal tracks (\"Blue Jay Way\" and \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\") are sung by off-screen vocalists.\nThe remaining three of the thirty-four songs are rendered instrumentally. \"Flying\" is performed by The Secret Machines, \"And I Love Her\" is heard briefly as part of the orchestral score, and \"A Day in the Life\" is performed on guitar by Jeff Beck in a version recorded for Sir George Martin's 1998 album \"In My Life\".\nIn addition to the thirty-four Beatles songs, the soundtrack features an original score written by Elliot Goldenthal. Goldenthal worked on Taymor's previous movies \"Titus\" and \"Frida\". (Goldenthal and director Taymor have also been partners since 1982.)\nBeatles songs featured in the movie.\nThis is a listing of the thirty-four songs written by members of The Beatles that are heard on the soundtrack, in the order featured in the movie. This listing includes notation of three songs that are heard twice in the course of the movie, so there are a total of thirty-seven individual music cues.\nProduction dispute.\nIn March 2007, the media reported a dispute over the final cut of the movie. Concerned with the length of director Julie Taymor's cut of the movie, Revolution Studios (production studio) chairman Joe Roth tested a sneak preview of a shortened version without first informing Taymor. The incident caused a quarrel between the two, later involving Sony Pictures (distributor) Amy Pascal urging Taymor to agree to the shorter version. After several months of dispute, Taymor's version was eventually reinstated as the theatrically released version.\nReception.\nThe movie received mixed reviews from critics. As of January 6, 2008, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 52% of critics gave the movie positive reviews, based on 130 reviews. However, the movie is currently at 80% with the Rotten Tomatoes community. Metacritic reported the movie had an average score of 56 out of 100, based on 29 reviews.\nTop ten lists.\nThe movie appeared on a few critics' top ten lists of the best movies of 2007."}

The battle was a great defeat for the Japanese Navy, which lost three aircraft carriers and some 600 aircraft in two days of combat. This happened because the Japanese airplanes were getting old and their pilots had little training, compared to the more modern and better trained American forces. After the battle, the Japanese Navy was almost completely destroyed. This victory for Allied forces opened the door for the invasion of Iwo Jima."}

Teams from outside the UK compete too, for example in 2007 Team T-Mobile will take part.\nThe latest version, a professional stage race, was first run in 2004.\nHistory.\nThe Tour of Britain has had different names. This is because many different companies or groups of people have provided the money needed to have the event happen (\"sponsors\").\nThe modern tour.\n2004 Tour of Britain.\nThe first edition of the latest version of the Tour of Britain took place over five days in early September 2004. It was organised by SweetSpot along with British Cycling. The race was sponsored by the organisers of London's 2012 Olympics bid. It was well-promoted and many well-known teams were a part of the race. Such teams included T-Mobile (Germany) and U.S. Postal Service (USA). This was partly due to it being a 2.3 category race on the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) calendar.\nThe 2004 route ended with a 45 mile (72\u00a0km) criterium in London, where tens of thousands of people watching saw a long break by Londoner Bradley Wiggins last until the final lap.

The Tour was extended to seven days for 2007, with the extra day being used to run a stage in Somerset for the first time. Instead of finishing in London as in previous years, the 2007 race started in London and finished in Glasgow, which is using the event to boost its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games."}

She has received seven Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Writers Guild of America Awards. She was called the performer who had the greatest impact on culture and entertainment in 2008 by the Associated Press. They gave her their AP Entertainer of the Year award.\nFey graduated from the University of Virginia in 1992. She then moved to Chicago to take classes at the improvisational comedy group The Second City. She became a featured player there in 1994. Three years later, Fey became a writer for the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\"). She was promoted to the position of head writer in 1999. The following year, Fey was added to the cast of \"SNL\". During her time there, she was co-anchor of the show's \"Weekend Update\". After leaving \"SNL\" in 2006, she created her own television series called \"30 Rock\". The show is a situation comedy somewhat based on her experiences at \"SNL\". In the show, Fey plays the head writer of a fictional sketch comedy series.\nIn 2004, Fey made her movie debut as writer and co-star of the teen comedy \"Mean Girls\". In 2008, she starred in the comedy movie \"Baby Mama\", with Amy Poehler. In 2009, Fey won an Emmy Award for her satirical portrayal of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a guest appearance on \"SNL\".\nEarly life.\nFey was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, a township just outside of Philadelphia. Her mother is Zenovia \"Jeanne\" (n\u00e9e Xenakes), a brokerage employee of Greek ancestry. Her father is Donald Fey, a university grant proposal-writer of German and Scottish ancestry. She has a brother, who is eight years older, named Peter.\nFey was exposed to comedy early. She recalls:\nShe also grew up watching \"Second City Television\" (\"SCTV\") and says Catherine O'Hara is one of her role models.\nFey attended Cardington Elementary School and Beverly Hills Middle School in Upper Darby. By middle school, she knew she was interested in comedy. She did an independent-study project on the subject in eighth grade. Fey attended Upper Darby High School. There she was an honor student, a member of the choir, drama club, and tennis team. She was also co-editor of the school's newspaper. After her graduation in 1988, Fey enrolled at the University of Virginia. She studied playwriting and acting there. She graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAfter graduating, Fey first had plans to do graduate work in drama at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. But \"I just got this feeling like it wasn't going to work out\u00a0... [that] they were going to take my money and then cut me from the program.\" She moved to Chicago anyway, knowing about the improvisational comedy group, The Second City. She took night classes at Second City. She had a day job working at the front desk of a YMCA in Evanston to pay for her classes. Once her Second City training began, she became highly involved in the \"cult of improvisation\". She became, as she called it later, \"like one of those athletes trying to get into the Olympics. It was all about blind focus. I was so sure that I was doing exactly what I'd been put on this earth to do, and I would have done anything to make it onto that stage. Not because of \"SNL\", but because I wanted to devote my life to improv. I would have been perfectly happy to stay at Second City forever.\"\nIn 1994, she joined the cast of The Second City. She performed eight shows a week, for two years. She was also in the revues \"Citizen Gates\" (1996) and \"Paradigm Lost\" (1997., She performed with Scott Adsit, Kevin Dorff, Rachel Dratch, Jenna Jolovitz, and Jim Zulevic. Improvisation became an important part of her understanding of what it means to be an actress, as she noted in an interview for \"The Believer\" in November 2003:\nWhile in Chicago, Fey also made what she later called an \"amateurish\" try at stand-up comedy. She also performed at the ImprovOlympic theater.\n\"Saturday Night Live\" (1998\u20132006).\nWhile performing shows with the Second City in 1997, Fey sent several scripts to NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\"). She had been asked to send them by \"SNL\"'s head writer Adam McKay. McKay was a former performer at Second City. She was hired as a writer for \"SNL\" following a meeting with \"SNL\" creator Lorne Michaels. Fey moved to New York. She told \"The New Yorker\", \"I\u2019d had my eye on the show forever, the way other kids have their eye on Derek Jeter.\" At first, Fey \"struggled\" at \"SNL\". Her first sketch to air starred Chris Farley in a Sally Jessy Raphael satire. Fey went on to write a series of parodies. This included one of ABC's morning talk show \"The View\". She co-wrote the \"Sully and Denise\" sketches with Rachel Dratch, who plays one of the teens.\nFey played an extra in one of the episodes in 1998. After watching herself, she decided to diet. By dieting she lost 30\u00a0pounds. She told \"The New York Times\", \"I was a completely normal weight. But I was here in New York City, I had money and I couldn't buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera.\" In 1999, McKay quit as head writer. Michaels asked Fey to replace McKay. She became \"SNL\"'s first female head writer. Fey does not make a big deal about this accomplishment because there have not been very many head writers.\nIn 2000, Fey began performing in sketches. She and Jimmy Fallon became co-anchors of \"SNL's Weekend Update\" segment. Fey admitted she did not ask to audition, but that Michaels asked her to do it. Michaels explained that there was \"chemistry\" (connection) between Fey and Fallon. Michaels, however, said that choosing Fey was \"kind of risky\" at the time. Her role in \"Weekend Update\" was well received by critics. Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote: \"...Fey delivers such blow darts\u00a0\u2013 poison filled jokes written in long, precisely parsed sentences unprecedented in \"Update\" history\u00a0\u2013 with such a bright, sunny countenance makes her all the more devilishly delightful.\" Dennis Miller, a former cast member of \"SNL\" and anchor of \"Weekend Update\", was pleased with Fey as one of the anchors for the segment: \"...Fey might be the best \"Weekend Update\" anchor who ever did it. She writes the funniest jokes\". Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\", however, commented that he was \"not enamored\" with the pairing.\nIn 2001, Fey and the writing staff won a Writers Guild of America Award for \"SNL\"'s 25th anniversary special. The following year at the 2002 Emmy Awards ceremony, she and the writing team won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program.\nThe pairing of Fey and Fallon ended in May 2004. Fallon left the show at the end of that season. He was replaced by Amy Poehler. It was the first time that two women co-anchored \"Weekend Update\". Fey revealed that she \"hired\" Poehler as her co-host for the segment. The reception to the teaming of Fey and Poehler was positive. Rachel Sklar of the \"Chicago Tribune\" noting that the pairing \"has been a hilarious, pitch-perfect success as they play off each other with quick one-liners and deadpan delivery\".\nThe 2005-2006 season was Fey's last. After it she left to make \"30 Rock\".\n\"30 Rock\" (2006\u2013present).\nIn 2002, Fey suggested a pilot episode for a situation comedy about a cable news network to NBC, who rejected it. The pilot was written again to focus on an \"SNL\" style series. It was accepted by NBC. She signed a contract with NBC in May 2003. It allowed her to remain in her \"SNL\" head writer position at least through the 2004\u20132005 television season. As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a primetime project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. She began developing the pilot project under the working title \"Untitled Tina Fey Project\".

Although the episode received generally good reviews, it finished third in its timeslot.\nThe network gave the series a second season, which began in October 2007. The show's third season premiered on October 30, 2008. The premiere episode set records for the highest ratings of the series.

She won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Lead Actress.\nSarah Palin.\nIn September and October 2008 Fey was a guest on \"SNL\" to perform a series of parodies of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. On the 34th season premiere episode, aired September 13, 2008, Fey imitated Palin in a sketch, alongside Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton. Their act included Clinton making fun of Palin about her \"Tina Fey glasses\". The sketch quickly became NBC.com's most-watched viral video ever. It had 5.7\u00a0million views by the following Wednesday. Fey acted in the role again on the October 4 show. She also acted as Palin on the October 18 show where she was joined by the real Sarah Palin. The October 18 show had the best ratings of any \"SNL\" show since 1994.

The show was well received by critics. Tim Townsend of \"The Wall Street Journal\" in review of \"Dratch &amp; Fey\", wrote that the fun part of watching them perform was \"seeing how comfortable they are with each other\".

Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" wrote: \"Fey is a delight to watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing.\" The movie grossed over $64\u00a0million at the box office.\nFey's projects after 2008 include her giving her voice to the character Lisa in the English language version of the Japanese animated movie \"Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea\" (titled \"Ponyo\" for its U.S. release).

Fey was quoted in the November 25, 2001, \"New York Times\" article as saying about it: \"It's a childhood injury that was kind of grim. And it kind of bums my parents out for me to talk about it\". But in an interview with Fey and Richmond in the January 2009 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", Richmond said the scar comes from a slashing incident, which happened when she was five. Richmond said: \"It was in, like, the front yard of her house, and somebody just came up, and she just thought somebody marked her with a pen.\" She has said she was unsure about talking about it because \"It's impossible to talk about it without somehow seemingly exploiting it.\" Fey shows her right (non-scar) side of her face more often when acting as her character Liz Lemon.\nHer charity work includes support of Autism Speaks.

People with nostalgia will often look at or use old things that they were familiar with years ago. This is because people feel more connected to those past times that they enjoyed, usually because it reminds them of how long it has been since they last connected to such past times. Examples where people may have the feeling of nostalgia includes watching old TV shows, using old technology that was very enjoyable, and playing with toys that you played with as a child.\nDuring the early Greek times, nostalgia was treated as a mental condition primarily based on extreme homesickness. In modern times, however, nostalgia is treated as a separate emotion. Nostalgia is often associated with positive feelings, often associated with positive memories of the past. The feeling of nostalgia often helps improve the mood of the person who is experiencing nostalgia. It also makes the person feel more connected to society. It can make the person feel more aware about living life to the best. Nostalgia is also shown to help reinforce memories, as well as assist with learning."}

It is the most famous and recognizable skating jump. It starts with the skater going forward. It is the only jump that does and that helps people know that the jump is an Axel jump. Because all skating jumps are landed going backwards, the Axel jump has an extra half rotation (full circle) in the air than all other skating jumps.\nHistory.\nThe jump was named after Axel Paulsen of Norway, who invented the jump.\nPerformances.\nThe first skater to do a double Axel in competition was Dick Button, and Carol Heiss Jenkins was the first woman to do it. The first skater to do a triple Axel in competition was Vern Taylor. The first woman to do it was Midori Ito.\nThe first pairs skater to do a \"throw triple Axel\" (he helps her with the jump) were Rena Inoue &amp; John Baldwin. It is not known who did the first \"throw double Axel\".\nMethods.\nThe Axel can be a single Axel (1 and a half rotations in the air), a double Axel (two and a half rotations in the air), or a triple Axel (three and a half rotations in the air). Most junior and senior skaters do a double Axel.\nMany senior-level male skaters do a triple Axel.\nOnly 15 female figure skaters have done a ratified triple Axel in competition: Midori Ito (the first one to do it), Tonya Harding, Yukari Nakano, Ludmila Nelidina, Mao Asada (the first one to land three triple Axels in one competition), Kimmie Meissner, , , , , , , Sofia Akatieva, Sofia Samodelkina, and . Only 11 have done it in ISU-sanctioned international competitions (Kimmie Meissner, Sofia Akatieva, Sofia Samodelkina, and Ayaka Hosoda did triple axels at national championships).\nValues.\nAccording to the International Judging System, the base value of a triple Axel jump is 8.0, and that of a double Axel is 3.3.\nConfusion.\nBecause the Axel is the most famous skating jump, many people make a mistake and call all skating jumps as \"Axel jumps\". This has led to many mistakes in sports reporting of figure skating, for example a report in 2006 saying that Miki Ando was the first female skater to land a quad Salchow in an international competition, which is a different jump."}

She has done shows in Baltimore and is a local celebrity. Meissner has many endorsements, which means she gets money from telling people she uses products.

The town was closed off by a blockade, and the Armenian population found itself needing food.\nMassacres in Shushi on March 22-26, 1920.\nFrom the very start of 1920, Governor Sultanov, breaking the temporary treaty agreement of August 22, 1919, continued the blockade around Karabakh. He increased the number of armed forces in strategically important locations and gave weapons to the local Azeri population.\nIn the early morning of March 23, 1920, the Azeri army soldiers and Kurdish gangs attacked the Armenian part of town and began a horrible massacre of the Armenian population, which finished in March 26, 1920.\nRemembering.\nThe famous Russian poet Osip Mandelstam, who was in Shushi in 1931, wrote a poem called \"The phaeton driver\" dedicated to this tragedy:\nIn July 1, 1997, the Baroness Caroline Cox gave a speech in the House of Lords, United Kingdom remembering the lives of Armenians who have been killed and specifically mentioned the occurrence in Shushi in 1920.\nResearch analyst Kalli Raptis in her book \"Nagorno-Karabakh and the Eurasian Transport Corridor\" wrote: \"'In July 1918, the First Armenian Assembly of Nagorno Karabakh declared the region self-governing and created a national Council and government. In August 1919, the Karabakh national Council entered into a provisional treaty arrangement with the Azerbaijani government in order to avoid military conflict with a superior adversary'. Azerbaijan's violation of the treaty culminated in March 1920 with the massacre of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Shushi (called Shusha by the Azerbaijanis)\"."}

In 1900 Mandelstam entered the prestigious Tenishevsky school, which also counts Vladimir Nabokov and other significant figures of Russian (and Soviet) culture among its alumni. His first poems were printed in the school's almanac in 1907.\nIn April 1908 Mandelstam decided to enter the Sorbonne to study literature and philosophy, but he left the following year to attend the University of Heidelberg. In 1911, in order to continue education in the University of St. Petersburg, he converted to Methodism (which he did not practice) and entered the university the same year.\nMandelstam's poetry, acutely populist in spirit after the first Russian revolution, became closely associated with symbolist imagery, and in 1911 he and several other young Russian poets formed the \"Poets' Guild\" (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u0445 \u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u0432, \"Tsekh Poetov\"), under the formal leadership of Nikolai Gumilyov and Sergei Gorodetsky.\nIn 1922 Mandelstam arrived in Moscow with his newlywed wife Nadezhda. At the same time his second book of poems, \"Tristia\", was published in Berlin. For several years after that, he almost completely abandoned poetry, concentrating on essays, literary criticism, memoirs (\"The Din Of Time\", Russian: \u0428\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \"Shum vremeni\"; \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f, \"Feodosiya\" \u2013 both 1925) and small-format prose (\"The Egyptian Stamp\", Russian: \u0415\u0433\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430, \"Yegipetskaya marka\" \u2013 1928). As a day job, he translated (19 books in 6 years), then worked as a correspondent for a newspaper.\nMandelstam died in 1938 in prison.\nMandelstam's non-conformist, anti-establishment tendencies always simmered not far from the surface, and in the autumn of 1933 they broke through in the form of the famous \"Stalin Epigram\"."}

It is part of the T\u014dhoku region on the island of Honshu. The capital city of the prefecture is Fukushima.\nThe Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is in this prefecture. The power plant had a meltdown in March 2011. It forced many people in Fukushima to move away from their homes, especially in the Futaba District.\nHistory.\nUntil the Meiji Restoration, Fukushima prefecture was known as Mutsu Province. In 1871, the territories of eleven clans were combined into three prefectures: Fukushima, Wakamatsu and Iwaki. On August 21 in 1876, they were united to form the current Fukushima Prefecture.\nGeography.\nFukushima is the prefecture that is furthest south in the T\u014dhoku region. It is the part of T\u014dhoku closest to Tokyo. Tokyo is about 300 kilometres further south. Fukushima located between 37 and 38 degrees north latitude.\nFukushima is divided by mountain ranges into three regions: (from west to east) Aizu, Nakad\u014dri, and Hamad\u014dri. Hamad\u014dri is on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and is the flattest and most temperate region. Nakad\u014dri is the most important farming part of the prefecture. The capital city, Fukushima, is in this area. Aizu is a tourist destination and has many mountains, scenic lakes, forests, and snowy winters.\nCities.\nThere are thirteen cities in Fukushima Prefecture:\nTowns and villages.\nTowns and villages in each district:\nNational parks.\nNational parks cover about 13% of the total land area of the prefecture. They include:\nEconomy.\nThe three main industries in Fukushima are manufacturing, commerce and farming.\nFukushima was the largest manufacturer in T\u014dhoku in 2008. The industry made about 5 and a half trillion yen (\u00a55,568,600,000,000). Manufacturers relied heavily on electrical power produced locally, much of it from nuclear power stations.\nTrade, including retail businesses, was the second largest industry in 2008. It made 4.7 trillion yen (\u00a54,720,600,000,000).\nIn 2009, the prefecture produced \u00a5245,000,000,000 (245 billion yen) from farming products. About 40%, or \u00a594,800,000,000 (94 billion yen), was from rice. Fukushima was the fifth largest rice producer in the country. It also produced large amounts of vegetables, meat, and fish. The two largest agricultural producers were the cities of Fukushima and K\u014driyama. Those two areas accounted for more than 15% of agricultural production in the prefecture."}

Like Mozart, he was a child prodigy and he might have become one of the world\u2019s most famous composers if he had lived.\nHis life.\nJuan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga was born in Bilbao, in the Basque Country in Spain. His father and older brother first taught him music. He started to compose when he was 11 years old, and by the time he was 15 he had already written 20 works. Many of these are now lost. He may have thrown them away, thinking that they were not very good. In 1921 he went to Paris where he studied the violin with Pierre Baillot, and counterpoint and harmony with Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis at the Paris Conservatoire. He was so good that by 1824 he had become a teaching assistant in F\u00e9tis's class. \nArriaga died in Paris at the age of nineteen, probably of a lung disease and exhaustion.\nHis music.\nArriaga has been called \u201cThe Spanish Mozart\u201d. His music, however, does not sound particularly Spanish. It has a more general European character, based on the style of Mozart and Beethoven. He wrote a symphony which sounds at times like Schubert. He also wrote an opera \"Los esclavos felices\" (\"The Happy Slaves\"), and three string quartets. The string quartets were the only works that were published while he was still alive."}

It is the only German letter that is not part of the basic Latin alphabet. The letter is pronounced (like the \"s\" in \"see\") and is not used in any other language.\nOrigin.\nToday's \"\u00df\" was created around the 1900s. (See w:en:\u00df and w:de:\u00df for details on the so-called \"Sulzbacher Form\".) It has two origins, one in Blackletter and one in Roman type (also called Antiqua).\nThe letter came from the long s (\"\u017f\") and the normal \"z\". Written fast by hand, they over time joined together to form a single glyph.\nSpelling.\nThe \"\u00df\" is used only in German and never at the start of German words. The uppercase \"\u00df\" (\"\u1e9e\") exists only for typesetting, such as in a dictionary. Instead of lowercase \"\u00df\", one can also write \"ss\". As no words start with double \"s\" or \"\u00df\", no uppercase \"\u00df\" is necessary.\nHowever, not every \"ss\" can be written as \"\u00df\". German often puts two or more words together to make a longer word. If the new word has \"ss\", it cannot be written as \"\u00df\". For example, \"Vo\u00dfstra\u00dfe\" is two words joined together (\"Vo\u00df\" and \"stra\u00dfe\"). It can also be written as Vossstra\u00dfe but not as \"Vos\u00dftra\u00dfe\" because \"sstra\u00dfe\" (or \"\u00dftra\u00dfe\") is not a word, and the \"\u00df\" is in the word \"Voss\" (\"Vo\u00df\").\nThe rules for German orthography have changed since 1996. Many common words that used to be written with \"\u00df\" are now written with \"ss\". For example, \"Flu\u00df\" (river) is now spelled \"Fluss\". When the preceding vowel is short, as in \"Fluss\", \"ss\" is used. However, the \"\u00df\" is used when the preceding vowel is long as in \"Stra\u00dfe\"."}

In the UK ATMs are often called cash machines, cashpoints or the \"hole in the wall\".\nSome ATMs allow people to do more than take money out. They may allow people to put in money, or check how much money is in a bank account.\nATMs may be found in stores and shopping malls. Sometimes, they can be found in bars or restaurants. Other times, at special events, people may set one up so the guests can use the machine, like at a fundraiser.\nPeople need a debit card or credit card in order to use an ATM. They will also need to have a Personal Identification Number (PIN), which is a code that lets them get into their account.\nThere are a number of scams with ATMs. In one scam, con artists look over the victim's shoulder and find their PIN; this is known as shoulder surfing. In another, they may install a video camera and get PIN numbers from that way. They then make cards using the PIN number and account number to be able to use that person's account."}

They tended the garden and could eat from any tree except the Tree of Knowledge. After they ate from the Tree of Knowledge, God punished Adam and Eve by making them leave the Garden of Eden forever.\nThe story is told in Book of Genesis 1-3 (in the old Testament of the Bible) and the Tanakh. The Tanakh translates the Garden of Eden as Paradise. \nWhere the name Eden is from.\nIn Sumerian, \"Eden\" is a name for the Steppe. \"Heavenly Eden\" is also mentioned. It refers to a place that appears to be fertile at first, but later changes to become infertile. Climatologists have said this is a good description of the climate change that happened in The Levant after the last ice age. The green steppe became dry. This meant that food was no longer available all year round, but only at certain times. This forced the people living at the time to start agriculture and to keep some of their food for the periods where there was none. Scientists have referred to this change as the Neolithic Revolution. This change of food is also mentioned in the story.\nBabylonian mythology sees the main reason for the creation of man to grow food for the gods. This is different in the Bible. There, god created plants as food for humans, and animals to keep them company.\nThe beginning of the Book of Genesis has been seen as describing the state before a climate change in a certain region. &gt;Because of this change, humans were \"condemned\" to growing crops and keeping some food in stock, to be able to eat it, during the times it did not grow. Genesis has been seen to only start when this region converted to agriculture (the Neolithic Revolution, mentioned above). This means that Genesis roughly covers the time from about 8000 - 6000 BC to about 2000 BC.\nHaving to leave the Garden.\nJudaism.\nJudaism teaches that sin cannot be passed on from the parents to their children. There is a free will, everyone is responsible for their own sins only. Humans can do bad things and good things. God's commandments help them do good things. What exactly makes up the Commandments of God is not written down, but needs to developed by tradition. Sins are forgiven once a year during Yom Kippur. Unlike Christianity, Judaism has no personified evil.\nChristianity.\nChristianity believes that sin can be passed on from the parents to their children. This is known as original sin. Without Jesus, humans must live in sin. Augustine of Hippo formalized this belief, which is now a dogma in the Western Christian denominations (Catholicism and Protestantism).\nIslam.\nIslam sees Adam and Eve being chased away as a chance for a new start. Islam says the Christian concept of original sin is false. This means that them being chased away does not change the relationship between men and God. According to Islamic tradition, Adam and Eve were placed in different parts of the world. They first had to wander around before they found each other."}

It is called a \u201crecital hall\u201d because it is designed for recitals: concerts given by one soloist, or sometimes a small group of musicians (chamber music). It is in Wigmore Street in the centre of London, just north of Oxford Street.\nThe Wigmore Hall was built in 1901 by the German firm Bechstein who made pianos. Originally it was called Bechstein Hall. Bechstein\u2019s showrooms were next door. The hall was built in a Renaissance style, with alabaster and marble walls and a rectangular hall with a small, raised stage. Above the stage the ceiling is in the form of a cupola which has a painting which shows the Soul of Music looking up at the Genius of Harmony: a ball of eternal fire whose rays are reflected across the world. These are separated by thorns from the rest of the picture which includes a musician and, on the other side, Psyche inspiring a composer to write music.\nThe \"Bechstein Hall\" opened on 31 May 1901 with a concert given by the virtuoso pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni and violinist Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe. During its early period many famous musicians played there, including Artur Schnabel, Pablo Sarasate, Percy Grainger, Myra Hess, Arthur Rubinstein and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns.\nBecause it was owned by a German firm, the hall was seized as \"enemy property\" during World War I. The hall with over 130 pianos was sold at an auction to Debenhams for a very small amount of money, and was re-opened as Wigmore Hall in 1917. Musicians who have performed there since include Sviatoslav Richter, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles, Sergei Prokofiev, Shura Cherkassky, Paul Hindemith, Andr\u00e9s Segovia, Julian Bream, Peter Pears, Benjamin Britten and Francis Poulenc. \nToday the Wigmore Hall seats 540 people. Many concerts are broadcast on BBC Radio 3. Famous musicians perform there, as well as young musicians who are just starting their career.\nThe Wigmore Hall publishes on its own record label \"Wigmore Hall live\" recordings of concerts that were given by famous musicians. The pianos in the Wigmore Hall today are made by Steinway.\nThe Wigmore Hall's director is John Gilhooly. His future plans include having lots of music by living composers"}

The organisation is based in London, but they arrange examinations in places all over the world. Many people, especially children, who learn instruments take examinations of the ABRSM as it helps them to become better players because it gives them something to work for. People of any age can take the exams. Those who pass an exam get a certificate. Over 620,000 candidates take the ABRSM examinations every year in over ninety countries.\nThe organisation is called \u201cAssociated Board of the Royal Schools of Music\u201d because it is organised by a group of four music conservatoires: \nGraded Exams.\nExams can be taken on many different instruments. In nearly each case there are eight grades, numbered from 1 to 8. For example, someone who has learned the piano for a short while may take Grade 1 once he or she can play pieces such as a simple minuet, and play a few scales with separate hands. By the time they take Grade 8 they will need to be able to play movements from sonatas by composers such as Beethoven, play all 24 scales in various ways very fluently and be good at sight-reading.\nThe marks are given out of 150. The pass mark is hundred. Below hundred marks is a \u201cFail\u201d. one hundred and twenty marks to one hundred and twenty nine is called a \u201cMerit\u201d and one hundred and thirty and above is a \u201cDistinction\u201d.\nAlthough some students take each of the grades as they get better at their instrument, it is not necessary to have passed earlier grades in order to take a higher grade. For grades 6 and above it is necessary to have passed Grade 5 Theory or Practical Musicianship or Jazz. This is to make sure that students have a good knowledge of music.\nThe examiners are people who are professional musicians. Many of them are music teachers. They have a wide experience of music and they are trained by the ABRSM so that they all mark in the same way.\nThe ABRSM also publish a lot of music, including the music set for their exams.\nThere are four kinds of exams:\nPractical Exams.\nThese are by far the most commonly taken exams. Available for over 35 instruments, these exams consist of 4 different sections:\nEach section has a certain number of marks and all the marks add up to 150. 100 is a pass, 120 a merit and 130 a distinction.\nThere is also a Prep Test for those who are not yet ready to take Grade 1 but would like to have the experience of taking an exam. Students who take a Prep Test are not given a mark. It is a way to encourage young people and make them relaxed about the idea of taking exams.\nTheory Exams.\nThese are written papers about musical theory. They are marked out of 100: 66 or more is a pass; 80 or more is a merit; 90 or more is a distinction.\nPractical Musicianship.\nThese exams will test a student\u2019s understanding of rhythm, melody, key and notation together with the ability to sing and play from memory, and improvise and to recognise changes to and answer questions about a score.\nJazz Exams.\nThese are the newest types of exams. Jazz piano was first offered in 1999. At the moment they are only available for flute, piano, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet and trombone. They are also only available from Grades 1-5. They are marked in the same way as practical exams. However many of the pieces include large sections where they have to improvise (make something up) using particular chords.\nDiplomas.\nThe ABRSM offer diplomas in three disciplines:\nFor each discipline there are three levels of award:\nThese are professional qualifications which allow a person to put the letters after his or her name."}

{"id": "69735", "revid": "344989", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69735", "title": "Engraving", "text": "Engraving is putting a design onto a hard, flat surface, by carving into it. The result may be a decorative piece in itself, as when silver, gold or steel are engraved, or may provide a printing plate of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper which are also called engravings. Engraving was an important method in history of making images on paper, both in artistic ways, such as making a decorative print, and also for printing books and magazines. It has long been replaced by photography in its commercial uses and, is nowadays much less common in printmaking, where it has been almost completely replaced by etching and other techniques.\nThe engraving process.\nEngravers use a steel tool called a burin to cut the picture or pattern into the surface, mostly a copper plate. Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that give different line types when used. The burin gives us a line that is unique because of its steady appearance and smooth edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines on them, used to do work on larger areas. Flat gravers are used for doing work on letters, as well as most musical instrument engraving work. Round gravers are commonly used on silver as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. \nHistory and usage.\nIn ancient history, the only engraving that could be made were the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after 1000 B.C. \nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate metal. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to make artistic images on paper in Germany in the 1430s. The first and greatest period of engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as Martin Schongauer, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and Lucas van Leiden. \nThereafter engraving tended to lose popularity to etching, which was a much easier technique for an artist to learn. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial picture-making. \nBefore the invention of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, because they were cheap to use in printing.\n When two sets of parallel line \"hatchings\" crossed each other for higher density, the pattern was known as \"cross-hatching\". Claude Mellan is well known for his technique of using lines of different thicknesses. One example is his \"Sudarium of Saint Veronica\", an engraving of the face of Jesus from a single spiralling line that starts at the tip Jesus's nose (pictured).\nModern engraving.\nBecause of the high level of detail that can be done by a master engraver, faking engraved designs is almost impossible, and modern banknotes are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other papers that should not be faked. Engraving is so fine that a normal printer can not make the detail of hand engraved images properly. In the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, more than one engraver will work on the same printing plate, making it nearly impossible for any person to duplicate all the engraving on almost any banknote or document. \nMany classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more \"elegant\" design is desired and a limited amount of different colours is acceptable.\nEngraving machines such as the K500 or K6 by \"Hell Gravure Systems\" use a diamond \"pen\" to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8,000 cells per second to an accuracy of 0.1\u00a0\u00b5m and below. They are of course fully computer controlled and the whole process of cylinder making is fully automatic.\nThe engraving process with diamonds is state of the art since the 1960s. \nNow, laser engraving machines are being made and even today the mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make about 8 million printing cylinders worldwide per year.\nBiblical references.\nThe earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to Judah\u2019s seal ring. (Genesis 38:18), followed by (Exodus 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jeremiah 17:1). \nEach of the two onyx stones on the shoulder pieces of the high priest\u2019s ephod was engraved with the names of six different tribes of Israel, and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest\u2019s turban, was engraved with the words: \u201cHoliness belongs to Jehovah.\u201d Bezalel, along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.\u2014Ex 35:30-35; 28:9-12; 39:6-14, 30."}

It is used to go skateboarding. The first skateboards were a piece of wood with rollerskater attached to it. This became popular and by 1960, skateboards were made in production. As more skateboards were made, more people liked the new sport. However, it was dangerous and people started to fall off. As a result, skate parks started to close down. With less places to skate, skateboarders had no where to go. A small group of skateboarders carried on skateboarding in the street and around cities. After 20 years, the sport began to grow into what we know now. Skateboarding is a popular sport with many younger riders. Young people sometimes skateboard on the street. There are many different types of skateboards like stunt skateboards, penny skateboards, Longboards, short boards and more. \nParts.\nThe normal parts that make a complete skateboard are the deck, trucks, wheels, bearings, hardware, and griptape.\nBut digging in further, there are so many differences. There are soft skateboard wheels which are better for going fast and rolling over small debris and rocks, and hard wheels that are usually used by the pros and most skaters at the skatepark.\nThere are many different types of trucks, hardware, and bearings that have different ABEC ratings.\nDeck.\nMost decks are made with six to nine-plywood layers. Other materials used in making decks fiberglass, bamboo, resin, Kevlar, carbon fiber, aluminum, and plastic. All these make the board more light. Some decks made from maple plywood are dyed to make many different colored plywood. Modern decks are different in size. Most are 7 to 10.5\u00a0inches wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when transition or ramp skating. Skateboard decks are normally between 28 and 33\u00a0inches long. The bottom of the deck can be printed with a design by the maker or it can be blank. And there are so many different skateboard deck brands to choose from. \nThe longboard, a common different kind of skateboard, has a longer deck. This is mostly ridden down hills or by the beach. The longboard was made by two surfers; Ben Whatson and Jonny Drapper. One of the first deck companies was called \"Drapped\" taken from Jonny's second name. \"Old school\" boards (those made in the 1970s\u201380s) are mostly wider and often have only one kicktail. Different kinds of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.\nThe Skateboard deck concave is noted mainly in three types: low, medium, and high. While the low concave is having small curvature and makes the safe ride, but you can\u2019t put more stress on the edges deck. Medium concave will easily found in the present market due to the high demand for a beginner. High concave is raised more at the edge, making it perfect for performing Flip tricks and Ollie. Medium concave is readily available in the market because it suits beginners, which keeps it always in demand.\nGrip tape, when put on to the top of a skateboard, gives a skater's feet grip on the deck. It is most often black. However, it can come in many different colors like clear. Clear allows the top of the deck to be decorated. It has an adhesive back and a sandpaper like top."}

It is about long. Its southern end is at U.S. Route 1 in Miami, Florida and its northern end is at the Canadian border in Maine. It connects many major cities in the eastern half of the USA. It was completed in 2018.\nHistory.\nPortions of the highway have or used to have tolls. Many parts of I-95 were made up of various toll roads that had already been constructed or planned, particularly in the northeast. Many of these routes still exist today, but some have removed their tolls.\nMany notable bridges and tunnels along I-95 were also tolled. The Fuller Warren Bridge, spanning the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida, was tolled until the 1980s and was replaced in 2002. The Fort McHenry Tunnel is underneath the harbor of Baltimore, Maryland and was opened in 1985. The George Washington Bridge, opened in 1931, carries I-95, US 1, US 9, and US 46 (latter is officially considered to end at the NY state line) across the Hudson River between New Jersey and Upper Manhattan.\nA study that could lead to the imposition of tolls on I-95 in North Carolina is under way as of March 2010.\nImprovements.\nFederal legislation has identified I-95 through Connecticut as High Priority Corridor 65. A long-term multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the entire length of I-95 through Connecticut has been underway since the mid-1990s and is expected to continue through at least 2020. Several miles of I-95 through Bridgeport were recently widened and brought up to Interstate standards. Work has shifted to reconstructing and widening of I-95 through New Haven, which includes replacing the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. Environmental studies for reconstructing and widening of I-95 from New Haven to the Rhode Island state line are also progressing.\nThere are plans to expand the I-95 corridor from Petersburg, Virginia, to Florida through a U.S. multi-state agreement to study how to improve the corridor through widening and reconstruction, with the goal of reducing congestion and improving overall safety for years to come.\nFlorida continues to complete widening projects. As of December 2010, I-95 from the South Carolina\u2013Georgia line south to Jacksonville, Florida has been upgraded to six lanes. The section from Jacksonville to the I-4 junction in Daytona Beach was expanded to six lanes in 2005. As of 2009, widening projects continue in Brevard County from the SR\u00a0528 junction in Cocoa to Palm Bay, as well as in northern Palm Beach County.\nIn 2009, state legislators representing Maine's Aroostook County proposed using federal economic stimulus funds to extend I-95 north to Maine's northernmost border community of Fort Kent via Caribou and Presque Isle. The proposed route would parallel New Brunswick's four-lane, limited access Trans-Canada Highway on the U.S. side of the Canada\u2013United States border. Legislators argued that extension of the Interstate would promote economic growth in the region."}

It was the last Beatles project finished before the band broke up.\nHistory.\nAfter the \"White Album\" (\"The Beatles\") was released in late 1968, the Beatles talked about making a television special, where they would play songs from the album for an audience. It would be the band's first live public performance since 1966.\nAs 1969 began, the band decided instead to begin work on a new set of songs, and film the process of rehearsing and recording all the songs, then performing them live. The project was titled \"Get Back\", and a song by that name was worked up during rehearsals. The band agreed to perform all the songs without studio or , as they had long used.\nFirst week: Twickenham Film Studios.\nThe Beatles rented a at Twickenham Film Studios, where their instruments and equipment were set up. They were used to working from afternoons until late at night on music, but had to arrive between eight and ten o'clock in the morning, to meet the filming schedule. The band did not use this setup for long. The early hours and the cold, huge soundstage made them uncomfortable.\nThere was also between the Beatles, and it showed. The Beatles could not agree on where to perform the show, and for how large an audience. The suggested locations ranged from Los Angeles, California to Tunisia, and the size of the audience from a few dozen to thousands of people. Nobody had a location in mind that the rest liked, and George Harrison decided he did not want to perform a public concert at all.\nPaul McCartney took charge of the rehearsals, and drove the band hard to play his new songs just the way he imagined them. The other Beatles became tired of this, because it did not give them much chance to , the way they were used to doing. George Harrison got especially tired of McCartney telling him what to play, and his own songs not getting the attention they deserved. John Lennon also had new songs, but was more interested in spending time with Yoko Ono than in making another Beatles record. He was also of Harrison's new songs. Yoko Ono gave her opinions on the band's music, which they were not used to hearing from anyone but their producer, George Martin. McCartney and Harrison Ono's being at Lennon's side constantly. Ringo Starr tried to play the peacemaker, but did not always succeed. Harrison walked out during one lunch break, saying he had had enough. The band stopped work on the production, and decided to find a new location to work.\nThe next weeks: Apple Studio.\nHarrison went to a Beatles business meeting, a few days after he left the rehearsal. McCartney agreed to mend his ways, and let Harrison have more input. Lennon and Harrison also made up. The idea of finishing \"Get Back\" with a public show was dropped. Nobody wanted to return to the movie studio, and they began to look for another place to work on their new songs.\n\"Magic Alex\", a Greek-born inventor, had been hired by the Beatles to build them a new recording studio, in the basement of the which was the home of their company, Apple Corps. Alex spent a great deal of money over many months, trying to make a first-rate facility. He did not understand recording or studio technology well, though, and the studio he made had many technical problems. The Beatles only found this out when they tried to use the place to record. Things did not work, and this added to the tension felt by the band, and the people who worked for them.\nGeorge Martin was able to help the Beatles, by working around the problems in the basement studio. He borrowed recording equipment so the band could finish their project. The movie cameras were also set up in the basement, and the Beatles went back to work on their music. This time things were as crowded as the first location was cavernous, and again the band and their crew were uncomfortable.\nThe Beatles usually \"warmed up\" by playing old songs they had learned growing up. Many of these were captured on camera or tape during the sessions. Not all the songs were complete, or true to their original versions. When the band went from playing old songs to trying out new ones, problems came up. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison each wanted certain things for their music, and enough time to make the records the best they could be. This did not always work out, and they sometimes insulted each other for trying to outdo the others, or for letting their musical influences show. It made the sessions unpleasant.\nGeorge Harrison helped the of the band, when he brought a guest musician, Billy Preston, to the sessions. All of the Beatles liked Preston, and got along while he was there. He played keyboards along with the band, and gave the records a fuller sound. McCartney's girlfriend Linda brought her daughter Heather to the studio, and they helped cheer things up. Linda sang background vocals on \"Let It Be\", a gospel-like song by McCartney.\nThe question of where and when to finally perform the new songs was settled, when the Beatles decided to give a show on the roof of Apple headquarters. This happened on January 30, 1969, early in the afternoon. The Beatles performed for the movie cameras, and for anyone who could hear them outside.\nAs it happened, the music coming from the rooftop caused a traffic jam along Savile Row, where the building was located. Local police came to Apple, and tried to stop the show. Mal Evans, one of the Beatles's most trusted helpers, went downstairs and talked to the police, to stall them until the band could finish playing. After performing \"Get Back\", \"Don't Let Me Down\", \"I've Got A Feeling\", \"One After 909\", \"Dig A Pony\", and another version of \"Get Back\", the band went inside.\nThe next day, the Beatles gave another show, back in the Apple basement. This show was for the cameras, though, and not a live audience. They performed \"Two of Us\", \"Don't Let Me Down\", \"Let it Be\", \"Get Back\", and \"The Long and Winding Road\". Some of these songs were too hard to record outdoors, with their keyboard parts.\nPostproduction.\nThe movie crew shot more than a hundred hours of movie footage, which was more than enough to make a television special. The Beatles worked a little longer on the recordings of the \"Get Back\" songs, ending up with over twenty-nine hours of session tapes. The problem was, nobody was happy with the music that had come from the sessions. The band members had argued and disagreed on camera, and did not always make their best efforts on each other's songs, or to get along. This was plain to anyone who saw the footage, or listened to the dialogue between songs.\nGeorge Martin tried to remix the recordings, and make an album from the songs, while the Beatles' movie personnel tried to edit the movie footage into the TV special the band wanted. The band's problems were only magnified by the results, and they blamed each other, and the people who worked for them, for what showed. The Beatles decided to abandon the project, and work on other things. Only one single was released from the sessions, with the songs \"Get Back\" and \"Don't Let Me Down\". Billy Preston's name appeared underneath the band's, and stories started that Preston might join the Beatles. He never did, but he signed a recording contract with Apple Records, their record label. The other songs stayed \"in the can\".\nThe \"Get Back\" project became another problem that was dividing the Beatles. There was also trouble with Apple Corps, and personal issues between the band members. They had begun to make music apart the year before, and this increased as they stopped getting along as people. McCartney and Lennon both married their girlfriends, and lost control of their publishing company, Northern Songs. George Harrison began to play with musicians outside the Beatles. Ringo Starr started a new career as an actor in movies. The Beatles issued a new single, with the songs \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Old Brown Shoe\". John and Paul played on the first song, and George and Ringo on the second. They had stopped working as a unit, and George Martin stopped coming to recording sessions, which he had never done before.\n\"Abbey Road\".\nDuring the summer of 1969, the Beatles felt sorry for the way the \"Get Back\" sessions had gone. They wanted to forget that time, and make another new album of songs, back at Abbey Road Studios. George Martin decided to come back, on the band's promise that they really would work together \"like the old days\", with Martin taking charge. The band kept their promise. \"Abbey Road\" was the result, and was issued in the early fall. As the record was being released, the Beatles met to discuss future projects. John Lennon, freshly back from his first non-Beatles concert, playing in Toronto, surprised everyone by announcing that he was quitting the band. He agreed to not make a public announcement, because this would have hurt the band's chance to their recording contract. Lennon instead focused on his and Yoko Ono's new group, the Plastic Ono Band.\n\"Let it Be\".\nAt the end of the year, Apple's accountants told the Beatles that they would have to release some kind of album and program from the \"Get Back\" sessions. They had spent too much money on the project to just forget about it. Glyn Johns, a young music producer, tried to assemble an album from the session tapes, but he also could not please the Beatles. Anxious fans and insiders worked together and released a album from Johns's mix. Even though it was an album, it sold many copies and received radio airplay. The public wanted to hear the songs, good or bad.\nPhil Spector, a legendary producer who predated the Beatles, had always wanted to work with them. Allen Klein brought Spector to England early in 1970 to meet them. John Lennon and George Harrison got along well with Spector, who produced a record of Lennon's song \"Instant Karma!\" the same day he wrote it. Lennon and Harrison gave their OK for Spector to work on the recordings, and Ringo Starr played along with the musicians Spector hired, to make overdubs. This went against the original plan to present the songs live, but was accepted to \"sweeten\" \u2013 and finish \u2013 the recordings.\nAn eighty-minute program was edited together from the movie footage, and the band decided it would make a better movie than a television show. The Beatles had a contract with United Artists, who agreed to distribute the movie, which was titled \"Let it Be\". (The \"Get Back\" title was dropped, since \"Get Back\" had already appeared as a single almost a year earlier.)\nSome of the new songs that appeared in the movie, including \"Across the Universe\" and \"I Me Mine\", were not finished on record. A session was scheduled in January 1970 to record full versions of some songs, but John Lennon refused to attend. George Harrison made a joke about this, during a take of \"I Me Mine\", referring to Lennon as \"Dave Dee\", another British musician.\nSpector applied his \"Wall of Sound\" style to the Beatles recordings, including an old tape of \"Across the Universe\", so it could appear on record. His finished album was listenable, and showed none of the troubles that affected the band during the sessions, but it did not sound the same as other Beatles albums. Paul McCartney hated the changes Spector made to his songs on the album, especially \"The Long and Winding Road\", but he could not stop the album from being issued.\nAnother problem was the timing of the record's release. Allen Klein had succeeded in remaking the Beatles's recording deal, and McCartney was not bound by the same promise Lennon had been, to not say he was leaving the band. His first solo album, finished early in 1970, included a press release stating that he had no further plans to work with the Beatles. This effectively broke up the band. He also wanted the album released ahead of \"Let it Be\".\nRingo Starr, who also had a solo record (\"Sentimental Journey\"), due to appear, was sent to ask McCartney to change his release date. The two argued, and McCartney threw Starr out of his house. The release schedule was changed, so McCartney could have his wish. Starr's album appeared earlier than planned, and \"Let it Be\" was pushed back from April to May.\nReception.\n\"Let it Be\" was both a hit movie and a hit album, and won a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack. Paul McCartney accepted the award. The news that the Beatles were breaking up was very sad to their fans, however, and the knowledge made watching the movie a experience. Many fans and critics did not like Spector's changes to the Beatles style on record, and said so publicly.\nA souvenir book was also issued, but instead of being a real document of the sessions, the book was and heavily edited, and reflected little of what was intended. It never appeared in the United States.\nLate in 1970, John Lennon issued a solo album, \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", which made his feelings plain in its last song, \"God\": Lennon sang \"I don't believe in Beatles.\" He gave a long interview to \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, which was later published as a book, \"Lennon Remembers\". He told his side of the \"Let it Be\" story, declared \"That movie was set up by Paul, for Paul\", and said he regretted not announcing that he quit the Beatles first.\nWhen home video came along in the 1970s, \"Let it Be\" became a popular rental and sales title. Over time, the Beatles asserted their copyright control over the movie, and copies were withdrawn. The movie has been planned as a reissue many times, but has yet to be officially released on DVD.\nIn 2003, recording engineers went back to the old session tapes, and used to make a new version of the familiar \"Let it Be\" songs. The new version was close to what the Beatles had wanted to make in the first place, and had none of Spector's post-production work. The album was issued as \"Let it Be... Naked\", and was praised as a \"real\"-sounding recording."}

Each member is elected by one of the country's federal electoral districts which are usually called \"ridings\".\nThe House of Commons was established in 1867, when the British North America Act 1867 created the Dominion of Canada, and was modelled on the British House of Commons. The House of Commons is sometimes called the \"lower house\", even though it has more power than the \"upper house\", the Senate.

The B and C vitamins are the vitamins that dissolve in water. A healthy person's gut can easily take riboflavin from food and pass it on to the blood for the body to use. The body needs the B vitamins to get energy from food. Without riboflavin and the other B vitamins people's bodies cannot use fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.\nThese foods have a lot of riboflavin. We say that they are rich in riboflavin or good sources of riboflavin:\nLight can break down riboflavin molecules into other molecules that the body cannot use.\nIf anyone eats too much riboflavin, the gut does not take up enough\nto make a person sick, but an injection with too much riboflavin can make one sick.\nThe kidneys pass riboflavin out in the urine, so when there is too much riboflavin in the body, the part that one does not want will not stay in the blood for long. If there is much riboflavin in the urine, the urine becomes bright, fluorescent yellow. Vitamin pills, or a meal with a lot of liver or egg white turns the urine yellow because such foods put so much riboflavin into the blood.\nTo make Vitamin B2 for vitamin pills or to add to foods, industrial companies grow special yeasts, other fungi, or bacteria that make a lot of riboflavin.\nRiboflavin is yellow or orange-yellow, so it can be useful as a food coloring. People get some very bad kinds of sickness (deficiency diseases) when their food has too little riboflavin. Adding extra riboflavin can stop people from getting such sicknesses. To prevent riboflavin deficiency, people may add riboflavin to baby foods, breakfast cereals, pasta, sauces, fruit drinks, and foods such as cheese that are made from milk (dairy products). People call it fortification with riboflavin when they add riboflavin to food. A lot of the riboflavin that people make, they use in vitamin pills.\nNutrition.\nRiboflavin deficiency.\nWhen there is too little riboflavin in the food, it causes what people call a primary riboflavin deficiency. Some people who have something wrong with their guts get what people call a secondary riboflavin deficiency: even if there is plenty of riboflavin in the food, the sick gut cannot get it out of the food and pass it on to the blood.\nRiboflavin deficiency can cause sores in the mouth (mouth ulcers), cracked red lips, cracks at the corners of the mouth (angular cheilitis), and a sore throat. The eyes may become yellow, stinky and watery, and bright light might hurt the eyes easily so that it is hard to open the eyes in strong daylight (photophobia). A riboflavin deficiency also can cause dry, scaly skin that cracks easily, and itchy, painful private parts.\nWhen all these three things go wrong, angular cheilitis, photophobia, and sore, itchy skin on the private parts, doctors call it the oral-ocular-genital syndrome. The syndrome shows that there may be riboflavin deficiency.\nIf riboflavin deficiency gets bad enough in animals, they grow too little, become unhealthy, and they may die. Dogs with bad riboflavin deficiency do not grow well, their skins become sore and their hair may fall out. Their eyes become cloudy, their insides may bleed, they become weak, they cannot move or even stand properly. In the end they lie down and die. All this is very much like what one might see in humans with riboflavin deficiency, but we seldom see such things except where people are very poor and starving. Still, millions of people in rich countries do not understand the need to eat the right foods or are too poor. They might have quite such bad signs of riboflavin deficiency, but still have what we call \"sub-clinical\" symptoms, not bad enough to send them to hospital, but bad enough to make them unhealthy and to stop children from growing properly and becoming healthy.\nSubclinical riboflavin deficiency also happens more easily in women taking the contraceptive pill. It also may happen when people get old, or cannot eat properly, or who have sicknesses such as AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and chronic heart disease. We can tell that the body does not lose all its riboflavin easily because riboflavin deficiency does not cause illness all at once."}

In humans and animals, fertility means that the parent can produce babies.\nMore precisely, fertility is the capacity of an individual or population to produce viable offspring. By 'viable' is meant 'able to live and reproduce'.\nIn agriculture, fertility means that a soil can support the growth of plants because it contains the right minerals and nutrients.\nFertility can also be used as a metaphor: having a \"fertile imagination\" means being able to think of many new and interesting things.\nAs a measure, fertility rate is the number of children born per couple, or person or population. This is different to fecundity. This is defined as the \"potential\" for reproduction (influenced by gamete production, fertilisation and carrying a pregnancy to term. In English language, the term was originally applied only to females, but increasingly is applied to males as well, as common understanding of reproductive mechanisms increases and the importance of the male role is better known. Infertility is a deficient fertility.\nHuman fertility depends on factors of nutrition, sexual behavior, culture, instinct, endocrinology, timing, economics, way of life, and emotions. Animal fertility is no less complex, and may display astounding mechanisms.\nHuman fertility.\nFemale Fertility.\nIn the United States, the average age of menarche (first period) is about 12.5 years. However, in most girls, menarche does not signal that ovulation has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. \nWomen's fertility peaks between ages 22\u201326, and after 35 it starts to sharply decline.\nBirth rates have been noted by Henri Leridon, PhD, as an epidemiologist with the French Institute of Health and Medical Research.

Many problems can be cured with medicines or surgery. This will allow conception through normal sex. The treatments below are divided into 3 categories.\nInfertility.\nWhen a person is infertile it means that they are unable to have a child naturally. Infertility is define as the inability to fall pregnant or carry a pregnancy until birth after 12\u00a0months or more of unprotected sex. About 10% of people are infertile. This means that 1 in 10 people will not be able to conceive a child naturally. There are many causes of infertility some of them can be treated. As a woman gets older, her fertility declines.

The term has been used in many different ways at different times, but there are some things in common.\nPostmodernism says that there is no real truth. It says that knowledge is always made or invented and not discovered. Because knowledge is made by people, a person cannot know something with certainty - all ideas and facts are 'believed' instead of 'known'. People believe that they know what the truth is, but they will think that the truth is something different later. This is the opposite of 'objectivity', which says that the truth is always there and people have to discover it.\nSince postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent, people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right. Postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes, because it means nothing to say that one belief is right and the other is wrong. Postmodernism says that if somebody has a belief and tries to make somebody else believe it also, it means that they are just trying to have power over them.\nStarting with the 18th century Enlightenment and into the early 20th century, many people believed that science and new knowledge would make the world better. When scientists or philosophers discovered something new, it would always make society a little bit better. They thought that social progress could not be stopped. Modernism especially believed this. But postmodernism says that there is no real social progress. It says that while some things about the world change, people only want to believe that the world is better than it was. It changes but does not get better, because there is no 'better.'\nPostmodernism says that since peoples' opinions change, and since one person's opinion cannot be more right than another, it means nothing to say that (for example) one work of art is better than any other. Postmodernism says that art, music, and literature, for example, can be anything that its maker says that it is. Postmodern art and literature commonly talk about themselves and make fun of themselves. They make fun of 'serious' art and even the idea of art. Postmodernism has influenced many cultural fields, including literary criticism, philosophy, sociology, linguistics, architecture, visual arts, and music.\nThe term postmodernism was first commonly used in the 1949 to talk about modern architecture. Many people did not like modern architecture because it had too many box-like shapes and people did not think it was pretty. Some of them started the postmodern architecture movement. Postmodern architecture uses surface ornament, historical reference, and less box-like shapes.\nPostmodernist ideas can be seen in philosophy, the study of culture and society, literature, architecture, design, as well as in history and law. Postmodernism also led people to think differently about love, marriage, popular culture, and the change in much of the Western world from an industrial to service economy. \nThe term \"postmodernity\" usually means the period of time when postmodern ideas became common (the second half of the 20th century). Some experts think that postmodernism is now over, especially in literature. \nDifferent definitions.\nThe term \"Postmodernism\" is often used to refer to different, sometimes contradictory (they cannot both be right) concepts. Common definitions are:\nBecause the term postmodernism can be used to talk about so many different things and can mean many different things, some people say that it is only a buzzword that means nothing. Dick Hebdige, in his book \u2018Hiding in the Light\u2019, writes:\n\"When it becomes possible for a people to describe as \u2018postmodern\u2019 the d\u00e9cor of a room, the design of a building, the diegesis of a film, the construction of a record, or a \u2018scratch\u2019 video, a television commercial, or an arts documentary, or the \u2018intertextual\u2019 relations between them, the layout of a page in a fashion magazine or critical journal, an anti-teleological tendency within epistemology, the attack on the \u2018metaphysics of presence\u2019, a general attenuation of feeling, the collective chagrin and morbid projections of a post-War generation of baby boomers confronting disillusioned middle-age, the \u2018predicament\u2019 of reflexivity, a group of rhetorical tropes, a proliferation of surfaces, a new phase in commodity fetishism, a fascination for images, codes and styles, a process of cultural, political or existential fragmentation and/or crisis, the \u2018de-centring\u2019 of the subject, an \u2018incredulity towards metanarratives\u2019, the replacement of unitary power axes by a plurality of power/discourse formations, the \u2018implosion of meaning\u2019, the collapse of cultural hierarchies, the dread engendered by the threat of nuclear self-destruction, the decline of the university, the functioning and effects of the new miniaturised technologies, broad societal and economic shifts into a \u2018media\u2019, \u2018consumer\u2019 or \u2018multinational\u2019 phase, a sense (depending on who you read) of \u2018placelessness\u2019 or the abandonment of placelessness (\u2018critical regionalism\u2019) or (even) a generalised substitution of spatial for temporal coordinates - when it becomes possible to describe all these things as \u2018Postmodern\u2019 (or more simply using a current abbreviation as \u2018post\u2019 or \u2018very post\u2019) then it\u2019s clear we are in the presence of a buzzword\".\nBritish historian Perry Anderson says that postmodernism is an important concept and is important for the study of contemporary (current) culture."}

Some erasers produce a lot of dust while some produce dust that all stick together. There are some good-quality erasers which are very soft and can erase easily, while some are very hard, and a lot of rubbing is needed. The classic pink eraser is made for smaller, lighter errors, whereas a thick, white eraser is made for bigger and/or darker marks."}

She was the mother of artists Heather McCartney and Mary McCartney, fashion designer Stella McCartney, and musician James McCartney. Her father was attorney Lee Eastman, whose law partner was his son (Linda's brother) John Eastman. Her mother was Louise Linder, who was an heiress to a department store fortune.\nEarly life.\nLinda grew up in Scarsdale, New York, and attended Sarah Lawrence College. She enjoyed music, and sang girl group songs with friends. When The Beatles became famous in America, she attended one of their concerts. She never considered a musical career.\nLinda married a geologist, John See, and they had a daughter, named Heather. See wanted to move to Africa to work, and take his wife and daughter. Linda did not want to go, and they were divorced. She became a photographer, and took pictures for magazines and the press.\nBefore long, she began to photograph rock bands and singers. She became well known for this. The Rolling Stones once made her the exclusive photographer for one of their public appearances. In time, she visited England, to photograph the pop stars there.\nThe Beatles.\nLinda had been attracted most of all to John Lennon of the Beatles when she first saw them. In person, though, she was charmed more by another Beatle, Paul McCartney, when they met. McCartney was engaged to actress Jane Asher, but she wanted to wait to have children, and McCartney did not. Their engagement ended. McCartney loved to spend time with Linda's daughter Heather, and the three of them seemed to make a family. Linda and Heather moved into McCartney's home during 1968.\nLate, in 1968, Linda became pregnant. She and McCartney were married, and had a baby (named Mary after McCartney's own mother) the next year. During this same time, the Beatles were growing apart. They had business problems, and no longer had the same kinds of plans or hopes. Linda hoped her father and brother, whose clients were mostly entertainment personalities, could help solve the business problems. The fact that they were her family (and now McCartney's, by marriage) did not put the other Beatles at ease. They chose Allen Klein to represent them instead. Klein and the Eastmans did not get along, and this caused further problems. The Beatles began to break up late in 1969.\nBesides the band's problems, Paul McCartney and John Lennon had grown apart personally. Lennon divorced his first wife Cynthia in 1968, and started a relationship with Japanese artist Yoko Ono. They were also married in 1969. Lennon and Ono spent as much time as possible together, and McCartney often felt out of place. McCartney and Linda also spent a lot of time together, but separated to work on their own projects. Linda and Yoko did not get along well, but each supported their men, and encouraged them to believe in themselves. Later, some fans blamed one or both women for breaking up the Beatles, but their role was not crucial to that. It was one of many factors that drove the band apart.\nAfter the Beatles.\nPaul McCartney suffered from depression for a time, when the Beatles ended. It had been his longtime band, made up of good friends, and he had lost both. He turned to his family for comfort. Linda and their children were always there. McCartney and Lennon argued in the media, and Linda also took verbal jabs at Lennon and Yoko Ono. Surprisingly, when they met in person, everyone usually acted in a completely different way, and were kind to each other.\nLinda began to sing with her husband, and to help him to write new songs. He wanted her to do this, and liked her input. He also wanted to perform again for small audiences, as the Beatles had done in their early days. He taught Linda to play piano, so she could share in the experience. Linda did not become a virtuoso musician or singer, but she added to the sound of McCartney's new band, which he called Wings. The couple enjoyed performing together, as part of a band.\nAdding other musicians, Wings began to play small shows, sometimes turning up at a school or club in the morning and asking to play, for no charge. As they played more, they began to give regular concerts, and to go on tours. The McCartneys would bring their children along during their school vacations. The McCartney children did not realise their parents were celebrities, and the family atmosphere between all of them was strong.\nAlthough now a musician, Linda continued her photography, and published books of her works. She and McCartney also became vegetarians, out of their love of animals. Linda became an advocate for animal rights and related causes. She learned and made recipes for vegetarian meals, and began to write cookbooks.\nAfter Wings ended, Linda still recorded and performed with her husband, but she was now recognized as an activist for social causes, and for charity work. She launched a line of vegetarian frozen dinners. They became popular, and in time made Linda wealthy on her own. Paul McCartney was knighted in 1997, and Linda was named Lady McCartney.\nIn 1995, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which McCartney's mother died of in 1956. Medicine had advanced since that time, but Linda died of breast cancer in 1998, at the Arizona ranch she owned with her husband. A memorial service was held in London, England, and former Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr attended, marking the last time they and Paul McCartney appeared and performed together in public."}

Jeff had been seen on WWF television as early as age 16. His first WWF match was against The 1-2-3 Kid and came on May 25, 1994 in Erie, Pennsylvania. Early on, Jeff, along with his brother Matt and friends, started their own wrestling organization, the TWF (Trampoline Wrestling Federation). In it they would perform many of the moves they saw on TV. The federation eventually became a part of a county fair in North Carolina, U.S.. Jeff, Matt, and friends then began to work for other independent wrestling companies. They drove all over the East Coast of the United States, working for companies many small companies.\nWorld Wrestling Federation.\nThe Hardy Boys (1998-2002).\nThe Hardy brothers eventually caught the eyes of the World Wrestling Federation. Jeff was only 16 at the time. After being signed to a contract in 1998, they were trained by Dory Funk, Jr. in his Funkin' Dojo. They were trained with other notable wrestlers such as Kurt Angle, Christian, Test, and A-Train. When the team was finally brought up to WWF TV, they formed the tag team called The Hardy Boys. During this time, they were managed by Michael Hayes. In 1999, they fought mainly with Edge and Christian.\nThe team of Matt and Jeff won the WWE Tag Team Championship six times. Because of this, they would be known as one of the most successful tag teams in WWE history. In 2000, Matt and Jeff found a new manager in their real-life friend Lita. Together, the three became known as \"Team Extreme\".\nJeff was well known for his high risk stunts in many of the Hardy Boys' matches.

Digital computers and digital communication like the internet usually use binary. The meaning of each \"bit\" depends on the place where it is used. For example, a \"bit\" can represent 'Yes' or 'No', or it can represent 'True' or 'False'. A large amount of information, like a picture, can be represented by using a list of many \"bits\". \nA digital system is different than an analogue (US- analog) system, which represents information in a continuous way. \nThe word \"digital\" is most commonly used in computing and electronics."}

Ever since the Soviet Union was founded in 1917, it imprisoned people who spoke out against it or were otherwise dangerous. Imperial Russia in previous decades had a similar system of prison camps. But the Soviet Union camp system grew to be one of the largest prison systems in existence. The Soviet camp-system was set up under Vladimir Lenin.\nIt reached its peak during Joseph Stalin's rule from the 1930s to the early 1950s. \nThe Gulag was run at first by the GPU (State Political Directorate), later by the NKVD and in the last years by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). The internment system grew rapidly, reaching a population of 100,000 in the 1920s. According to Nicolas Werth, the yearly mortality rate in the Soviet concentration camps varied, reaching 5% (1933) and 20% (1942\u20131943) and dropped in the post-war years to about 1 to 3% per year at the beginning of the 1950s.\nSoviet leaders believed it was right to put these people to work and make their labor and goods part of the national economy. In fact, two out of every hundred workers in the Soviet Union were gulag prisoners. By 1936, there were 5,000,000 prisoners in the gulags.\nLocation.\nEven though the Gulag is often associated with Siberia, labor camps were built across the Soviet Union. Siberian camps greatly simplified the problem of keeping prisoners from running away, though it was harder to feed these camps and move goods in and out because the camps were so far away.\nDecline and legacy.\nThe Gulag system declined during the 1950s after the death of Joseph Stalin, and many people were released starting in 1954. The Gulag program was ended with a government decree in 1960.\nAccording to the Gulag administration, 10 million people were sent to the gulags between 1934 and 1947. However, Western scholars estimate that between 1918 and 1956, 15 to 30 million died in the gulags. \nFormer prisoner and Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote two books about the Gulag: \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich \" and \"The Gulag Archipelago\".\nWhen Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union, he began a \"De-Stalinization\" process. He made a secret speech, in which he denounced Stalin as having committed many murders of innocent people in Gulags and elsewhere, including Katyn massacre and slaughter of Poles in Ukraine &amp; Belarus in 1937 and 1938.

He not only sang in opera but also in other kinds of music. Known for his televised concerts, media appearances, and as one of the \"Three Tenors\" (the other two were Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras). Pavarotti became enormously popular after a performance of the aria \"Nessun Dorma\" from Puccini\u2019s opera \" Turandot \" for the opening ceremony of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. \nPavarotti was also well known for his award-winning charity work for raising money on behalf of refugees and the Red Cross.\nEarly life.\nLuciano Pavarotti was born in Modena in north-central Italy. His father was a baker who also liked to sing, his mother worked in a cigar factory. The family did not have much money. During World War II they lived in the countryside on a farm. \nPavarotti started to listen to his father\u2019s recordings of famous tenors of the day such as Beniamino Gigli, Giovanni Martinelli, Tito Schipa and Enrico Caruso. At around the age of nine he began singing with his father in a small local church choir. He was a normal boy who liked playing football and even thought of being a professional soccer goalkeeper, but his mother said he should be a teacher. His father said he would continue to support him, but once he was 30 years old he would have to earn money to support himself.\nPavarotti began singing lessons seriously in 1954 at the age of 19. He met a singer called Adua Veroni. He married her in 1961. Pavarotti had to earn money, so he became a teacher, and then an insurance salesman. For several years he just gave a few recitals without being paid for them. Then he had problems with his throat and stopped singing for a short time, and, surprisingly, this helped his voice to become really good.\nCareer.\nPavarotti made his opera d\u00e9but in the role of Rodolfo in \"La boh\u00e8me\" by Puccini on April 29, 1961 in the town of Reggio Emilia. Soon he was singing in: the Vienna State Opera. He sang in the United States with Joan Sutherland. In 1965 he sang at La Scala, probably the most famous of all opera houses. He was singing in the famous Franco Zeffirelli production of \"La Boh\u00e8me\", with Mirella Freni singing Mimi and Herbert von Karajan conducting. . His first appearance as Tonio in Donizetti's \"La fille du r\u00e9giment\" took place at Covent Garden on June 2 of that year. It was his performances of this role that made people call him the \"King of the High Cs\" (The note C above Middle C is a very high note for a tenor to sing). \nPavarotti learned many more operatic roles and sang all over the world. In 1972, he sang in a production of \"La fille du r\u00e9giment\" by Donizetti at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. The audience were amazed when he sang nine high Cs. They applauded so much that he had 17 curtain calls. He sang the role of Rodolfo in (\"La boh\u00e8me\") in the first \"Live From The Met\" telecast in March of 1977, which attracted one of the largest audiences ever for a televised opera. He won many Grammy awards and platinum and gold discs for his performances. \nIn 1976 Pavarotti sang at the Salzburg Festival appearing in a solo recital. He returned to the festival in 1978 with a recital and as the Italian singer in \"Der Rosenkavalier\", in 1983 with \"Idomeneo\", and both in 1985 and 1988 with solo recitals.\nIn 1977 there was a cover story in Time Magazine about him . That same year saw Pavarotti's return to the Vienna State Opera where he had not been for 14 years. With Herbert von Karajan conducting Pavarotti sang Manrico in \"Il trovatore\". In 1978, he appeared in a solo recital on \"Live from Lincoln Center\".\nHe made his international recital d\u00e9but at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri in 1973 as part of the college\u2019s Fine Arts Program, now known as the Harriman-Jewell Series. Perspiring due to nerves and a cold, he kept a handkerchief in his hand all the way through the concert. The handkerchief was often associated with him after that during his solo performances.\n1980s\u20131990s.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, he set up \"The Pavarotti International Voice Competition\" for young singers, performing with the winners in 1982 in excerpts of \"La boh\u00e8me\" and \"L'elisir d'amore\". The competition gave young people a chance to start their singing careers. It was repeated in 1982. They even travelled to China.\nIn 1992 Pavarotti sang in La Scala in a new Zeffirelli production of \"Don Carlo\" conducted by Riccardo Muti. Pavarotti's performance was heavily criticized by some observers and booed by some of the audience. The singer never returned to La Scala again after that.\nPavarotti became even more well-known throughout the world in 1990 when his sang Giacomo Puccini's aria, \"Nessun Dorma\" from \"Turandot\" which was used as the theme song for the BBC TV coverage of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. The aria made him a kind of pop star and it remained his trademark song. This was followed by the hugely successful Three Tenors concert held on the eve of the World Cup final at the ancient Baths of Caracalla in Rome with fellow tenors Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras and conductor Zubin Mehta, which became the biggest selling classical record of all time. The high point of the concert happened when Pavarotti sang a famous part of di Capua's \"'O Sole Mio\". Domingo and Carreras copied him and the audience enjoyed it very much. This was one of the most remembered moments in opera of our time. Throughout the 1990s, Pavarotti appeared in many big outdoor concerts, including his televised concert in London's Hyde Park which drew a record audience of 150,000. In June 1993, more than 500,000 listeners gathered for his performance on the Great Lawn of New York's Central Park, while millions more around the world watched on television. The following September, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, he sang for a crowd of about 300,000. Following on from the original 1990 concert, Three Tenors concerts were held during the Football World Cups; in Los Angeles in 1994, in Paris in 1998, and in Yokohama in 2002. \nPavarotti's rise to stardom was not without occasional difficulties, however. He got a reputation as \"The King of Cancellations\" because he often cancelled performances, and this made him unpopular with some opera houses.\nIn 1998, Pavarotti was given a very special award: the Grammy Legend Award.\n2000s.\nIn 2002, Pavarotti split with the Herbert Breslin, the man who had been his manager for 36 years. On 13 December 2003 he married his former personal assistant, Nicoletta Mantovani, with whom he already had a daughter. A second child did not survive, due to complications at the time of birth. He started his farewell tour in 2004, at the age of 69, performing one last time in old and new locations, after over 40 years on the stage.\nPavarotti gave his last performance in an opera at the New York Metropolitan Opera on March 13, 2004 for which he received a 12-minute standing ovation for his role as the painter Mario Cavaradossi in Giacomo Puccini's \"Tosca\".\nDeath.\nIn March 2005, Pavarotti had an operation to his neck. His health began to suffer. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in July 2006 and died of the disease on 6 September 2007 at his home in Modena, aged 71."}

It is a kind of tort. The law calls someone negligent if he hurts someone else, or someone else's property, because he was not careful enough. In a legal case about negligence, the person who brings the lawsuit is called the plaintiff and the person who is being sued is called the defendant.\nNegligence case.\nThe law about negligence is different in many places (or jurisdictions), but for the plaintiff to win, he or she usually has to prove at least four things:\nDuty.\nThe defendant's \"duty\" is what the law says that he or she has to do. Usually, the law says that people have to be \"reasonable\". That means they have to be careful, use good judgment, and not be unfair to other people. In some cases, the law tells people that they have special duties. In other cases, the law says that people have no duties at all. For example, in most places that use the common law, a person has no legal duty to rescue another person from harm, even if the rescue is very easy and does not cost anything or put anyone else in danger.\nBreach.\nWhen people do not follow their duty, the law says that they \"breach\" their duty.\nHarm.\nA plaintiff can usually bring a lawsuit only if he or she has been hurt, or has some other legal harm. The law tells people what kinds of injuries people can sue about.\nCause.\nA plaintiff can usually sue a defendant only if that defendant was the one who hurt the plaintiff. In many cases, it is easy to figure out who hurt someone. But sometimes people get hurt in ways that nobody expects. For example, a defendant might be driving while drunk, and he might hit an electric pole. The electric pole could fall down and cause a neighborhood to lose electric power. As a result, a person two miles away might trip and fall in the dark. The law will decide whether the drunk driver \"caused\" the person to trip and fall.\nOutside the law.\nThe word \"negligence\" is sometimes used outside the law in a similar way. It means that someone has not been careful enough."}

Her mother is a pureblood from the ancient wizarding family of the Blacks, and her father is a muggle born, therefore considering that the majority of her father's family are muggles she is considered a half-blood, even though he is not a muggle himself. Tonks is a \"metamorphmagus\", which means that she can change her appearance at will. Her Patronus is a jack rabbit, but it changed into a wolf (Remus's Patronus) due to her love for Remus Lupin.\nTonks is first described in the books as having a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short, spikey hair that was a violent shade of violet. She knocked over a plate in the Dursley's kitchen when the 'Advance Guard' came to pick up Harry to take to number twelve, Grimmauld Place.

A review by Serano had \"Scelidosaurus\" as the sister group (closest relative) to both the Stegosauria and Ankylosauria.\nA full-grown \"Scelidosaurus\" was rather small, compared to some later dinosaurs. Its length was about 4\u00a0metres (13\u00a0ft). \"Scelidosaurus\" was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its forefeet were as large as its hind feet, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture.\n\"Scelidosaurus\" and its Jurassic relatives were herbivorous. Other ornithischians had teeth capable of grinding plant material, but \"Scelidosaurus\" had smaller, less complex teeth. Its jaw could only do simple up-and-down movements. In this aspect, they resembled the stegosaurids, which also had primitive teeth and simple jaws. Also, like stegosaurs, they may have swallowed gastroliths to aid processing of food (because of the lack of chewing ability). This is also done by modern birds and crocodiles.

It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Matthew Lillard, Dax Shepard, Courteney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf, Jamie Kennedy, Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett and Liev Schreiber.\nThe film was released on December 12, 1997 by Dimension Films as the second installment in the \"Scream\" film series. \"Scream 2\" takes place one year after \"Scream\" and again follows the character of Sidney Prescott (Campbell) and her brother Jerry (Lillard), now students at the fictional Windsor College, who becomes the target of a copycat killer using the guise of Ghostface. Sidney and Jerry are accompanied by film-geek Randy Meeks (Kennedy), Jerry's friend Tom Scott (Shepard) retired deputy sheriff Dewey Riley (Arquette) and news reporter Gale Weathers (Cox). Like its predecessor, \"Scream 2\" combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of comedy and \"whodunit\" mystery while satirizing the clich\u00e9 of film sequels. The film was followed by two sequels, \"Scream 3\" (2000) and \"Scream 4\" (2011).\nWilliamson provided a five-page outline for a sequel to \"Scream\" when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise. Following a successful test screening of \"Scream\" and the film's financial and critical success, Dimension moved forward with the sequel while \"Scream\" was still in theaters, with the principal cast all returning to star, Craven to direct and Beltrami to provide music.\nThe film suffered controversy following its significant issues with plot information leaking onto the Internet, revealing the identity of the killers. Combined with the film's rushed schedule, the script was rewritten often; pages were sometimes completed on the day of filming. Despite these issues, \"Scream 2\" earned $172 million, received several awards and nominations. The film also received positive reviews, with some critics arguing that the sequel surpassed the original in terms of quality.\nBeltrami received positive critical reception for his score for evolving the musical themes of the characters created in \"Scream\" although some critics claimed that the most memorable pieces from the film were created by composers Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. Elfman's contribution had been specially written for the film, but Zimmer's score for \"Broken Arrow\" was controversially used in the film, replacing Beltrami's own work. The soundtrack received negative feedback from reviewers but achieved moderate sales success, reaching #50 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nPlot.\nWhile attending a preview of the film \"Stab\", a film within a film based on the Woodsboro murders, Windsor College seniors Maureen Evans, Hugh Daniels and Phil Stevens (Jada Pinkett Smith, David Spade and Omar Epps) are murdered by Ghostface. Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes the act to be a publicity stunt until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen, Hugh tries to call the police, but the killer stabs him in the back, killing him.\nThe following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf), descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her brother Jerry Prescott (Matthew Lillard) and Jerry's friend Tom Scott (Dax Shepard) now study alongside their best friend Hallie (Elise Neal) and Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), and Derek's best friend Mickey (Timothy Olyphant). Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dwight \"Dewey\" Riley (David Arquette) to help Sidney, Jerry and Tom and reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney, Jerry, Tom and Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney and Jerry's mother. After Gale forcibly confronts Sidney, Jerry and Tom with Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale and Jerry angrily scolds at Sidney for hitting Gale.\nLater that evening, Sidney, Jerry and Tom go to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface murders fellow student Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar). After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attack Sidney, Jerry and Tom, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, prompting the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realising that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims, as Maureen Evans has the same name as Maureen Prescott, Phil Stevens as Steve Orth, Hugh Daniels as Dan Williams and Casey Cooper as Casey Becker.\nThat afternoon, while Gale is talking to Dewey, Tom and Randy on the campus lawn, she receives a call from Ghostface hinting that he is watching them. They search for him, but Randy, who tries to keep the killer on the phone, is dragged into Gale's broadcast van and is murdered by Ghostface. As night falls, Dewey and Gale review the tape of Ghostface killing Randy hoping to find some clues but the killer attacks them and seemingly kills Dewey. Gale hides and eventually escapes.\nIn the wake of the escalating murders, two officers drive Sidney, Jerry, Tom and Hallie to a local police station, but the killer murders them. In the ensuing struggle, Ghostface is knocked unconscious. After they climb out of the car, Sidney, Jerry and Tom insist on unmasking him, while Hallie insists they escape. When Sidney, Jerry and Tom walk back to the car, they see that Ghostface has escaped, who then stabs Hallie to death, forcing Sidney, Jerry and Tom flee.\nSidney, Jerry and Tom go back to the campus and find Derek in the auditorium tied to a crucifix, his mouth gagged with duct tape. Once Sidney, Jerry and Tom untie him, they is confronted by Ghostface, who reveals himself as Mickey and tells Sidney, Jerry and Tom that Derek is his partners. Derek desperately tries to persuade Sidney, Jerry and Tom that he is innocent and while Sidney, Jerry and Tom are deciding who is telling the truth, Mickey kills Derek. Mickey details his plan to become famous in the ensuing trial and media spectacle. He then announces his real partner, Debbie Salt, who arrives holding Gale at gunpoint. Sidney, Jerry and Tom recognise that Salt is actually Billy Loomis' mother, seeking revenge for her son's death. Mickey explains that they met online and agreed that Mrs. Loomis pays for Mickey's tuition fee while Mickey does the actual killing. Mrs. Loomis betrays Mickey and shoots him, as she plans to blame the murders on Mickey. Before he collapses, Mickey accidentally shoots Gale, causing her to fall off the stage, Sidney, Jerry and Mrs. Loomis fight, during their fight Mrs. Loomis shoots Tom in the stomach, killing him, until Cotton intervenes and eventually shoots Mrs. Loomis in the throat. As they debate whether or not she is still alive, they find Gale still alive. Mickey suddenly jumps to his feet, trying to attack them, only to be shot death by Sidney, Jerry and Gale. Sidney and Jerry then shoot Mrs. Loomis in the head to confirm her death, amd Jerry runs up to Tom and he gives Jerry some video tapes of he, Jerry, Dan, Sidney, Tatum, Billy, Stu, Randy, Cici, Martha, Jerry's old friends: (Justin Wilson, Douglas Harris, Karen James) and Sidney and Jerry's brother Steve, then Tom slowly dies, and Jerry cries over Tom's body. When the police arrive the next morning, Gale finds Dewey badly injured but still alive and accompanies him and Tom to the hospital. Sidney and Jerry instruct the press to direct questions to Cotton, rewarding him with the fame he has been chasing while removing the attention from herself as she and Jerry leave the university campus. A week later at Tom's funeral, Sidney and Jerry stand near Tom's grave.\nCast.\nLuke Wilson and Heather Graham cameo as actors in the in-universe \"Stab\" film. Tori Spelling and Donovan Patton appears as themselves, and Joshua Jackson cameos as one of Randy's classmates."}

AFMs provide pictures of atoms on or in surfaces. Like the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the purpose of the AFM is to look at objects on the atomic level. In fact, the AFM may be used to look at individual atoms. It is commonly used in nanotechnology.\nThe AFM can do some things that the SEM cannot do. The AFM can provide higher resolution than the SEM. Further, the AFM does not need to operate in a vacuum. In fact, the AFM can operate in ambient air or water, so it can be used to see surfaces of biological samples like living cells.\nThe AFM works by employing an ultra-fine needle attached to a cantilever beam. The tip of the needle runs over the ridges and valleys in the material being imaged, \"feeling\" the surface. As the tip moves up and down due to the surface, the cantilever deflects. In one basic configuration, a laser shines on the cantilever at an oblique angle, and allows for the direct measurement of the deflection in the cantilever by simply changing the angle of incidence for the laser beam. In this way, an image may be created revealing the configuration of the molecules being imaged by the machine.\nThere are many different operating modes for an AFM. One is the \"contact mode\", where the tip is simply moved across the surface and the cantilever deflections are measured. Another mode is called \"tapping mode\", because the tip is tapped against the surface as it travels along. By controlling how hard the tip is tapped, the AFM can move away from the surface when the needle feels a ridge, so that it will not hit against the surface when it moves across. This mode is also useful for biological samples, because it is less likely to damage a soft surface.\nThese are the basic modes most commonly used. However there are different names and methods such as \"intermittent contact mode\", \"non-contact mode\", \"dynamic\" and \"static\" modes and more, but these are often variations on the above described tapping and contact modes."}

The study of coats of arms is also called \"armory\". The practice of using distinct markings on a person's shield started in the Middle Ages, when a knight's helmet covered his face, making everybody look the same in battle. At first, only knights and nobility had coats of arms, but in the Middle Ages, some cities started using heraldry too. By the end of the Middle Ages, other people began using coats of arms, now called \"burgher arms\", which means they belong to a commoner and not a member of the nobility. An official in charge of approving and recording coats of arms is called a \"herald\". The related study of flags is called \"vexillology\".\nHeraldry is described in English using a specialised jargon called \"Blazon\" which is based on French words. Heraldry uses only bold, bright colors, called \"tinctures\", with special names. Gold, for instance, is called \"Or\". This word is often capitalised to distinguish it from the conjunction \"or\". Silver and white are sometimes treated as different colors, but in English Blazon both are called \"argent\". Some combinations of colors represent furs, and these have names that are only used in heraldry.

He made 200 \"gentlemen of good birth\" baronets. He did this partly to reward those people with more than a knighthood, without making them as important as a Baron. The other reason was that the king needed money to keep soldiers in Ireland.

This means that one ruler ruled over two countries, in this case the duchies of Coburg and Gotha. \"Saxe\" means of Saxony, because there were many small countries but all were ruled by members of the royal house of Saxony. Usually the royal house of Saxony means the rulers of the Kingdom of Saxony. The house of Wettin ruled the other states (Wettin is the family's surname).\nThe royal house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was created in 1826. One dynasty of the House of Wettin (the Dukes of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg) became extinct because there were no more male children to inherit.\nThe remaining members of the family divided their various lands between them. The duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld gave up Saalfeld and instead got the duchy of Gotha. Saalfeld became part of Saxe-Meiningen, which also took Hildburghausen when the Dule of Saxe-Hildburghausen became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg.\nOn 12 November 1826 Ernst III of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld became Ernst I Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of J\u00fclich \"(Juelich)\", Cleves and Berg, also Engern and Westphalia, Prince of Lichtenberg, Landgrave in Thuringia, Markgrave of Mei\u00dfen \"(Meissen)\", Count of Hennerberg, Count of the Mark and Ravensburg, Lord of Ravenstein and Tonna.\nErnst had two sons. His younger son, Albert, married his cousin Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Saxe-Coburg and Gotha became the name of the royal house of the United Kingdom from 1901 until 1917 (the reign of Edward VII), when the name was changed the Windsor because of hatred of anything German in World War I.\nThe Duchy in Germany.\nErnst I died in 1844 and his elder son and successor, Ernst II, ruled until he died in 1893. As he had no children childless, the throne of the Duchy passed to the male descendant's of Ernst's late brother Albert the Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria. But, the Duchies did not want to be joined to Great Britain, so their constitutions stopped the King and heir apparent of Great Britain from becoming Duke if other eligible male heirs exist. Therefore after Edward, Prince of Wales, came his next brother, Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Alfred's only son, also named Alfred, committed suicide in 1899, so when Duke Alfred died in 1900, he was succeeded by his nephew, Charles Edward the Duke of Albany, the sixteen-year-old son of Queen Victoria's youngest son, Leopold. (Duke Arthur of Connaught and his son did not want to become Duke, so renounced (gave up) their right to succession.) The new Duke started using the German version of his name, and ruled as Duke Carl Eduard. Until he came of age in 1905, the Hereditary Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg acted as Regent, Carl Eduard retained his British title Duke of Albany, but because he fought for Germany in the First World War, he was stripped of his British titles in 1919.\nCarl Eduard reigned until 18 November 1918 when the Workers' and Soldiers' Council of Gotha deposed him during the German Revolution. The two Duchies became separate states, but soon joined with bigger states. Saxe-Coburg became a part of Bavaria, and Saxe-Gotha merged with other small states to form the new state of Thuringia in 1920 in the Weimar Republic.\nThe capitals of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha were Coburg and Gotha. By 1914 the area and populations of the two duchies were:\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha was the only European country to appoint a diplomatic consul to the Confederate States of America. The consul was named Ernst Raven, consul in the State of Texas. When Raven asked the Confederate Government for a diplomatic exequatur (permission to be act as consul) on 20 July 1861 he was accepted.\nHouse.\nOther members of the family became kings of Belgium and Bulgaria, and married into nearly all of the other royal families of Europe. More than 50 years after Bulgaria became a republic, King Simeon returned to Bulgaria and was elected Prime Minister. After the First World War the Kings of Belgium stopped using the name Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, but never officially changed their name. Simeon of Bulgaria's legal name is Simeon Borisov Sakskoburggotski\nThe Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha stopped being independent in 1918, when Germany became a republic. Carl Eduard, the last reigning duke had his British titles taken away for supporting Germany in World War I. He died in 1954.\nGotha became part of the new state of Thuringia, and Coburg joined Bavaria."}

It was devised by Fintan Coyle and Cathy Dunning, and developed for television by the BBC Entertainment Department. It has since been replicated around the world. It was hosted by Craig Charles (2001-2002) and Claudia Winkleman (2002) and narrated by Chris Goldwell. The series features a team of contestants who take turns answering general knowledge questions. The object of each round is to create a chain of consecutive correct answers to earn an increasing amount of money for a communal pot within a specific time limit. The number of \"links\" in a chain are equal to the number of the contestants at the start of the show. An incorrect answer breaks the chain and loses all the money accumulated up to that point; however, a contestant can say \"bank\" prior to their question being asked, the accumulated money is stored, and the chain resets to zero. Six contestants competed to win a top amount of 50,000 (2001-2002) and 100,000 (2002) by playing a quiz/elimination contest. At the end of each round, each player is voted off as \"The Weakest Link\".\nFormat.\nThe original format features a team of six contestants who take turns answering general knowledge questions. The object of each round is to create a chain of six consecutive correct answers and earn an increasing amount for a single communal pot within a certain time limit. An incorrect answer breaks the chain and loses any money earned in that chain. However, before their question is asked, a contestant can choose to bank the current amount of money earned in a chain to a safe pot, after which the chain starts afresh. A contestant's decision not to bank, in anticipation that they will be able to correctly answer the upcoming question allows the money to grow, as each successive correct answer earns proportionally more money.\nWhen the allotted time for each round ends, any money not banked is lost, and if the host is in the middle of asking a question, or has asked a question but the contestant has yet to answer, the question is abandoned. Occasionally, the host gives the correct answer whether the contestant is able to answer the question correctly or not. The round automatically ends if the team successfully reaches the maximum amount for the round before the allotted time expires, and the next person says \"Bank\". Each round thereafter is reduced by 10 seconds as players are eliminated. The remaining two players have 90 seconds on the clock for the triple stakes round.\nThe first person to be asked a question in the first round is the player whose name is the first alphabetically in the original version. Every subsequent round starts with the \"strongest link\"\u2014the player with the most correct answers\u2014from the previous round, unless that person has been voted off, in which case the second strongest answers first.\nMoney tree.\nThe money tree was as follows:\n2001-2002\n2002 \nVoting and elimination.\nAt the end of each round, contestants must vote one player out of the game. Until the beginning of the next round, only the television audience knows exactly who the strongest and weakest links are statistically due to Goldwell's narration. While the contestants work as a team when answering questions, they are at this point encouraged to be ruthless with one another. Players often decide to vote off weaker rivals, but occasionally opt to eliminate stronger players as well. After the revealing of the votes, the host will interrogate the players on their choice of voting, the reasons behind their choice, as well as about their background and their interests. After interrogation, the player with the most votes is given a stern \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye!\" and must walk off the stage in what is called the \"Walk of shame.\" In the event of a tie, the strongest link has the final decision about who is eliminated. If they voted for a tied player, they have the option of sticking with their vote or changing it. The strongest link usually sticks with their original choice, unless another player in the tie has voted for them. Occasionally, the strongest link has voted for someone who is not in the tie, and so is forced to change their decision one way or the other.\nEnd of the game.\nFinal round.\nThe final two contestants work together in a final round identical to the previous ones; however, all money banked at the end of this round is tripled and added to the current money pool, forming the final total for the game. At the end of this round, there is no elimination, with the game instead moving to a head to head round.\nHead to head.\nFor the head to head round, the remaining two players are each required to answer five questions each in a penalty shootout format. The strongest link from the previous round chooses who goes first. Whoever has the most correct answers at the end of the round wins the game. In the event of a tie, the game goes to \"sudden death\". Each player continues to be asked questions as usual, until one person answers a question correctly and the other incorrectly.\nThe winner of the game takes home all of the money accumulated in the prize pool for the game, and the loser leaves with nothing, like all previous eliminated players. From 2001-2002, the maximum is 50,000 and In 2002, the maximum cash jackpot is 100,000.\nReception.\n\"The Weakest Link\" won the CableACE Award in 2002 for Best Exellence. "}

(It is not clear what his real name actually was; some historians think that his last name may really have been Thatch.) He attacked ships in the Caribbean and the American colonies. His flagship ship was the captured French slave ship \"La Concorde\" which Blackbeard renamed \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". About 1718 it ran aground near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina and was abandoned.\nBlackbeard often fought wearing a big feathered tricorn hat, and with lots of swords, knives, and pistols. Some pictures show him with lighted rope matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle. The matches burned slowly and gave of lots of smoke. They were designed to make him look frightening. He probably got the idea from seeing the burning rope was used to light the gunpowder in cannons and guns. (These old fashioned guns were called \"matchlocks\", later a flint was used to make a spark, these were called flintlock guns). No one knows how many wives Blackbeard had. The book \"A General History of the Pirates\" says that he had as many as fourteen wives, but he was not legally married to most of them.\nEarly life.\nBlackbeard is thought to have been born in Bristol, England. Teach went to sea when he was very young. He served on an English ship in the War of the Spanish Succession, privateering in the Spanish West Indies and along the Spanish Main. At the war's end in 1713, Teach, like many other privateers, turned to piracy. Blackbeard was born in a trade epicenter and he grew up knowing about sailing. Many merchant ships landed and traded there. \nBlackbeard the Pirate.\nTeach began as a pirate under Benjamin Hornigold. In 1716, Hornigold retired, taking advantage of an amnesty offered to former privateers by the British government. Teach then took command of his own ship.\nDuring the next two years Blackbeard attacked merchant ships, forcing them to allow his crew to board their ship. The pirates would seize all of the valuables, food, liquor, and weapons. Ironically, despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone.\nCapture and death.\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, Alexander Spotswood sent two ships after Blackbeard. On 18 November 1718, Lt. Robert Maynard sailed from Hampton, Virginia to Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina. On 22 November 1718, Maynard and his men defeated Blackbeard and the pirates. The most complete account of the following events comes from the \"Boston News-Letter\": \nTeach was said to have been shot five times and stabbed more than twenty times before he died and was decapitated. Legends about his death immediately sprang up. His headless body, was thrown overboard, but swam three times around the ship before sinking. Teach's head was placed as a trophy on the bowsprit of the ship. Captain Maynard had to keep the head to claim his prize when he returned home. Later, Teach's head hung from a pike in Bath, Somerset."}

They are the most visited of several similar groups in the limestone of the country, and the oldest discovered open caves in the world. Since 2008, Jenolan Caves has won many tourism awards, including 'Best Tourist Attraction' from Tourism Australia, in 2011. \nThey have many Silurian marine fossils. The calcite formations are sometimes pure white and are know for being very beautiful. \nThe cave network is very large, with over 40 km of multi-level passages, and the complex is still undergoing active exploration. \nSeveral kilometres of the caves have been rendered accessible to paying visitors and are well lit.\nWorld's oldest caves.\nBy measuring the ratio of radioactive potassium and trapped argon gas, which was produced when the potassium decayed, scientists determined the age of the clay in the caves to be approximately 340 million years old, thereby making the cave complex the world's oldest known and dated open cave system. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in association with the University of Sydney and the Australian Museum lead the efforts in scientific research into the caves.\nAboriginal Heritage.\nFor tens of thousands of years, the Jenolan area has been part of the culture of local indigenous peoples. This beautiful and mysterious place hold special significance to the Gundungurra people, who knew it as 'Binomil' or 'Bin-oo-mur'. Gundungurra people's knowledge of the caves goes back a long way, as there is a Dreamtime creation story about how the whole countryside came into being. The story describes an almighty struggle between two ancestral creator spirits - one a giant eel-like creature, Gurangatch, and the other, Mirrigan, a large native cat or quoll. In the early years of the 20th century, the Gundungurra people penetrated the caves as far as the subterranean water, carrying sick people to be bathed in this water, which they believed to have great curative powers.\nEuropean Discovery.\nIn approximately 1835-40 the area was recorded for the first time by either James, Charles or Alf Whalan, three brothers who each claimed to have discovered the caves while searching for a bushranger, James McKeown, whom they claimed used the caves as a hide-out. One of the less-visited caverns in the area is called McKeown's Hole, however there is no actual evidence of his existence. It is more likely the brothers were searching for cattle that had strayed from their nearby farm.[citation needed]\nGetting to Jenolan Caves.\nLocated 3 hours drive for day visitors from Sydney and Canberra, Jenolan Caves attracts over 250,000 visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist locations in rural New South Wales.\nThere is no public transport to Jenolan Caves. However, there are large carparks and a range of coach operators bring tourists from Sydney and Katoomba every day.\nActivities at Jenolan Caves.\nTen of the area's \"dark caves\" are open for regular guided tours every day (1 to 2 hours per tour). These 'show' cave tour sizes vary; for example the delicate Pool of Cerberus Cave can have only 8 on a tour, while the Lucas Cave (with its large chambers) can have up to 65 people per tour. \nTours also vary in difficulty, for example the Imperial Cave has the fewest stairs, while the River Cave is the most strenuous. However, the average tourist can tour any of these 'show' caves. \nA self-guided tour of the huge Nettle Cave/Devils Coach House is also available in a range of languages. Night tours run every night except Sundays, including the popular ghost tour, 'Legends, Mysteries &amp; Ghosts'.\nSeveral undeveloped caves are available for Adventure Caving (2 hours to all-day tours). These Adventure Caving tours include the Plughole Tour, which runs daily and includes basic abseiling. Other more challenging Adventure Caving tours are available.\nWhere to Eat and Stay.\nWhen visiting Jenolan Caves, tourists can stay at the heritage-listed Jenolan Caves House hotel, designed in 1897 by government architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, as a resort or retreat for the wealthy. To cater for the expectations of the well-to-do, Vernon included a ballroom and grand dining room (now Chisolm's Restaurant). Chisolm's is open for dinner every day, serving modern Australian cuisine. Facilities include an hotel/motel complex, self-contained cottages, restaurant, bar and cafe.\nNative Wildlife.\nThe huge Jenolan Reserve is a National Park, located in the World Heritage Blue Mountains Area, where signposted bush trails enable tourists to glimpse Australian birds and native wildlife, including kangaroos and platypus."}

In 1850 a firing squad shot the B\u00e1b in Tabr\u00edz, Iran.\nThe B\u00e1b had other names, for example the \"Primal Point\" and the \"Point of the Bay\u00e1n.\"\nThe B\u00e1b told everyone that another prophet who was stronger and even more powerful was coming soon. People who follow the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion believe the B\u00e1b was talking about Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, who started the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion.\nLife.\nEarly Life.\nThe B\u00e1b was born on October 20, 1819, in Shiraz, Iran. His father was a merchant, and many people in the town knew him. Very soon after the B\u00e1b was born, his father died. The B\u00e1b's uncle \u1e24\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 Siyyid `Al\u00ed was also a merchant, and he raised the B\u00e1b.\nWhen the B\u00e1b became an adult, he started working as a merchant with his uncle. In 1842 he married a woman named Khad\u00edjih-Bagum. Together they had one son, who they named A\u1e25mad. A\u1e25mad was very sick and died when as a baby. Someone who lived at the same time as the B\u00e1b said he was very calm and quiet; they said the B\u00e1b only spoke who he had too, and did not even answer questions. The B\u00e1b was always thinking and praying. People said he was handsome, and had a thin beard. He always dressed in clean clothes, and wore a green scarf and a black turban, or wrap of cloth on his head.\nThe Shaykhis.\nShaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i started a Shi'a Islam religious group in Persia in the 1790s. The member of the group, who were called Shaykhis, believes that god was sending a new messenger to earth very soon. They called the new messenger the Q\u00e1'im, or theMahdi. When Shaykh Ahmad died, Siyyid K\u00e1zim, who was from Rasht, Iran, became the new leader of the Shaykhis. Shaykh Ahmad lived was born in 1753 and he died in 1862. Siyyid K\u00e1zim was born in 1793 and he died in 1843.\nWhen the B\u00e1b went on a pilgrimage to Karbala and the places near it, he may have listened to Siyyid K\u00e1zim teach. Nobody knows for sure if he did or did not, because there are very few documents or records from that time.\nWhen Siyyid K\u00e1zim was dying, in December, he told all his followers\u2014people who believe what he taught\u2014that they should travel and try to find the new prophet from god. He called that prophet \"The Lord of the Age\", and told them that he would be discovered very soon. One of the people who believed Siyyid K\u00e1zim prayed and fasted, or stopped eating from dawn to dusk for forty days - his name was Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn. After that he travelled to Shiraz, and he met the B\u00e1b.\nAnnouncement to Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn.\nMull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn got to Shiraz on May 23, 1844. A young man wearing a green turban greeted him after he had not been in Shiraz for very long. In Iran at that time, only people who were related to the prophet Mu\u1e25ammad wore green turbans. Men who were related to the prophet Mu\u1e25ammad were called Siyyids. The young man was the B\u00e1b, and he invited Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn to his home.\nThe B\u00e1b asked Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn why he was in Shiraz, and Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn told him that he was searching for the new prophet, or Promised One. The B\u00e1b asked Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn how he would know who the prophet way. Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn told him that the prophet would come from a famous and good family, and would know many things without having to learn them, also that he would have no problems with his body. Then the B\u00e1b said that all of those things were true about himself. \"Behold, all these signs are manifest in me.\" The B\u00e1b was saying that he was the new prophet Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn had been looking for. This shocked, or startled Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn.\nMull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn had one more way to know who the new prophet was, and he had not told the B\u00e1b about. Siyyid K\u00e1\u1e93im had told Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn that the new prophet would write a book explaining the Surih of Joseph. Siyyid K\u00e1\u1e93im had also said that the new prophet would do this without anyone asking him to. After the B\u00e1b told Mull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn that he was the new prophet, he wrote a book about the Surih of Joseph. The B\u00e1b called that book the Qayy\u00famu'l-Asm\u00e1'\nAfter spending the night talking to the B\u00e1b Mull\u00e1 Husayn said this. (The words below might be hard to read.)\nLetters of the Living.\nMull\u00e1 \u1e24usayn was the B\u00e1b's first disciple. A student of a religious leader is called a disciple. In less than five months, seventeen more students of Siyyid K\u00e1\u1e93im became disciples of the B\u00e1b. All of the new disciples started believing the B\u00e1b was a new manifestation, or prophet of god without anyone else's help. One of these new disciples was a woman. Her name was Zarr\u00edn T\u00e1j Baragh\u00e1ni, and she was a poet. Later she was given a new name,\u1e6c\u00e1hirih (the pure). Later people started calling the first eighteen disciples and the B\u00e1b the Letters of the Living. The B\u00e1b told the Letters of the Living that it was their job to tell people that he was the new prophet.\nThe B\u00e1b said that the Letters of the Living were special. In Shi'a Islam there are fourteen special people, called the \"Infallibles\". Shi'as believe the \"Infallibles\" are always right. Muhammad, the twelve Im\u00e1ms, and Fatimah, are the \"Infallibles\" in Shi'a Islam. Just like the \"Infallibles\", one of the letters of the Living was a woman, and one was a prophet. Nineteen was a special number in B\u00e1bism. The Letters of the Living were very much like the Twelve Apostles of Christ."}

The movie won two Academy Awards. It was nominated for a total of five awards. It was directed by Blake Edwards, who also directed seven Pink Panther movies.\nSummary of the story.\n\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" is about a young woman named Holly Golightly. Holly suffered an abusive childhood, along with her brother, Fred. She and Fred ran from the abuse, and were taken in by \"Doc\" Golightly, who married her when she was about fourteen. Soon after, the marriage was annulled, and Holly again ran in search of a happier life. She eventually landed in New York City, where she became a high society escort, trying to raise money to make a home for herself and her brother. \nPaul Varjak, an aspiring writer being kept by an older woman, moves into Holly's building. Paul is amused by Holly's madcap lifestyle, and Holly sees Paul as a sort of \"kindred spirit\" in that they both are engaged in questionable business pursuits. They quickly form a friendship, but at some point, Paul's feelings turn romantic. The romantic attraction becomes mutual after a day of high-spirited fun; however, Holly's fear of being \"caged\" leads her to reject the relationship. \nAfter some time passes and Holly suffers a series of setbacks, she is reunited with Paul, and has to decide whether she should keep running from commitment, or accept the love he offers. The movie ends with a very famous scene of Holly, her \"no-name\" cat, and Paul embracing in the rain.\nExplanation of the title.\nHolly suffers from bouts of anxiety (the \"mean reds\"), and finds spending time at Tiffany &amp; Co. calming. She feels \"nothing very bad\" can happen to a person in such elegant surroundings. Though she clearly aspires to own beautiful and expensive things, it also seems she yearns for the sense of stability and protection she associates with wealth. She sometimes gets a breakfast pastry in the morning and takes it with her to look in the store. When she spends a day with Paul, she takes him to Tiffany &amp; Co., so they can look at all the fine jewelry, and he can experience one of her favorite places."}

It is a type of drug a doctor might give to put someone to sleep for an operation. Ketamine can also be used as a painkiller and a bronchodilator (which makes it easier for air to get into your lungs). \nSometimes it can lead to a special type of hallucination which makes you feel detached from yourself and the things around you which is why some people use it as a recreational drug. As it can have severe side effects, it is usually not available as an over-the-counter drug.\nKetamine was developed in 1962 as a rapid-acting dissociative anesthetic that was used in surgery. It was approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970. Unfortunately, abuse began along the West Coast and spread across the country by the 1980s. The illicit market produced new forms of the drug, available as powder, capsules, crystal rocks, tablets, and injectable solutions. The drug is largely abused intranasally (via sniffing) or orally.\nMedical use.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) lists ketamine as an essential medicine, especially as an anesthetic and analgesic. With medical supervision, ketamine is a better surgical anesthetic than many others, and it is safer for a wider range of patients. It is also the anesthetic of choice in veterinary surgery. In medicine ketamine is normally injected into a vein or muscle.\nKetamine is not the first anaesthetic a doctor would think of using in most situations because of the hallucinations it causes. On the other hand, while most anaesthetics suppress your breathing, resulting in the need for a machine to help you breathe, ketamine does not.\nThis can make it a useful anaesthetic when you don't have any equipment available, for example, in a war zone.\nSide effects.\nShort term.\nShort term side effects happen in about 40% of people and include:\nLong term.\nIn the medical setting ketamine is only given a few times so most long term effects mentioned below are found in recreational ketamine users and animal models.\nUrinary tract effects.\nThere are 110 reports of people with problems in their urinary tract due to using ketamine.\nSymptoms include:\nThese urinary tract problems are most common in people who have abused ketamine daily for a long time.\nNeurological effects.\nPeople who abuse ketamine a lot (more than 4 times a week) have been found to have impaired memory and increased depression when compared to people who don't abuse ketamine. Those who use ketamine less frequently (1-4 times per week)and those who had stopped taking ketamine showed no difference in the aforementioned parameters. This suggests that these problems with memory and mood do not affect infrequent users and might be reversible once ketamine use is stopped.\nOne study has recently been done using monkeys as a model to see if ketamine is toxic to the brain.\nThe study found that injecting the monkeys every day for 6 months with ketamine caused more cells to die in the front of their brain and also caused a decrease in activity in the areas of the brain which control movement.\nMechanism of action.\nKetamine is a NMDA antagonist in the CNS. By inhibiting NMDA receptors in inhibitiory neurons in the brain, it causes increased CNS activity and sympathomimetic effects. As a result, there is not only an anaesthetic effect, but also activation of the CNS unlike other anaesthetics. This is beneficial in surgical settings because it maintains blood pressure, airway reflexes, bronchioles remain dilated and airways patent. Making this a particularly useful drug in shock and surgery patients because of blood pressure maintained with ketamine use, unlike typical anaesthetics which cause decreased BP and respiratory suppression.\nResearch.\nTreating addiction.\nOne study by Evgeny Krupitsky has found that using ketamine along with psychotherapy and group therapy was a lot more effective at treating alcohol addiction than the traditional treatment.\nThe same scientist found that ketamine might also be useful for treating heroin addiction. Patients who had been treated for their addiction with multiple sessions of ketamine fared much better than those who had only had one session of ketamine with abstinence rates of 50% and 22.2% respectively.\nAs an antidepressant.\nSome small studies have been done which found that a single dose of ketamine was able to improve treatment resistant depression after just a few hours with the effects lasting for one week. The rapid anti-depressant effects of ketamine may prove to be a useful alternative compared to current anti-depressants which can take several weeks to have their effects.\nComplex regional pain syndrome.\nCRPS is a disease that causes severe pain and swelling, getting worse over time.\nSome studies have been done which suggest that ketamine might be useful as a painkiller for CRPS."}

The nearest land is Saint Helena, to the south-east.\nThe Ascension Island is named after the day of its recorded discovery, Ascension Day. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, of which the main island is St Helena.\nThe island is the location of a Royal Air Force station with a United States Air Force presence, a European Space Agency station and the BBC World Service Atlantic Relay Station. There is in the island one antenna of the five that assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigational system (others are on Kwajalein Island, Diego Garcia, Colorado Springs and Hawaii).\nHistory.\nThe Galician explorer Jo\u00e3o da Nova, working for Portugal, saw the Ascension island in the South Atlantic in 1501, when he was going to India; named it \"ilha da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Conception Island). En 1503 when the Portuguese navigator Afonso de Albuquerque saw the island on Ascension Day, in the church calendar, he named it after the feast day.\nOrganised settlement of Ascension Island began in 1815, when the British sent soldiers to the island as a precaution after imprisoning Napoleon I on Saint Helena to the southeast.\nIn 1836, Charles Darwin visited the Saint Helena and Ascension islands during his voyage in the Beagle. He described Ascension as an arid treeless island, with nothing growing near the coast. Sparse vegetation inland supported \"about six hundred sheep, many goats, a few cows &amp; horses\", and large numbers of guineafowl imported from the Cape Verde islands, as well as rats, mice and land crabs.\nIn 1843, botanist and explorer Joseph Hooker visited the island. Four years later, Hooker advised the Royal Navy that with the help of Kew Gardens, they should develop a long-term plan of shipping trees to Ascension. So, from 1850 and continuing year on year, ships came each with different plants from botanical gardens in Argentina, Europe and South Africa. By the late 1870s Norfolk pines, eucalyptus, bamboo, and banana trees grew at the highest point of the island, Green Mountain, creating a tropical forest covered with clouds.\nIn 1899, the Eastern Telegraph Company (now part of Vodafone) installed the first underwater cable from the island, connecting the UK with its colonies in South Africa. In 1922, the Ascension island was made a dependency of Saint Helena. The island was managed by the head of the Eastern Telegraph Company on the island until 1964 when the British Government appointed an Administrator to represent the Governor of Saint Helena on Ascension.\nIn 1981, the British government changed the status of Saint\u00a0Helena and the other Crown colonies to \"British Dependent Territories\".\nIn 2009, Saint Helena and its two territories received equal status under a new constitution, and the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nGeography.\nThe island is roughly triangular in plan, about 13\u00a0km across, with\nan area of , and has about 100\u00a0km of coastline. While the west and north-west coasts have sandy beaches, the south and southeast coasts form steep cliffs.\nThe highest point of the island is Green Mountain, or just \"The Peak\" (), which is high. Other high mountains are Weather Post (680 m - 1,995\u00a0ft), White Hill (525 m - 1,722\u00a0ft) and Sisters Peak (445 m - 1,460\u00a0ft).\nThere are several small islands (islets) and rocks surrounding the Ascension Island; the largest is Boatswainbird Island, north of the eastern part of the island.\nClimate.\nAscension island has a tropical but oceanic climate, with little changes from one season to another. The island is in the path of the South-East Trade Winds, and southeast and easterly winds blow for more than half of every month.\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification subtype for this climate is Am (\"Tropical Monsoon Climate\").\nThe temperature is constant throughout the year. Monthly average maximum temperatures at sea-level vary only between about 27\u00a0\u00b0C and 31\u00a0\u00b0C. At 660 m on Green Mountain maximum temperatures are typically about 13\u00a0\u00b0C lower and minimum temperatures about 7\u00a0\u00b0C lower than\nat sea-level. The relative humidity at sea-level is around 70%.\nThe average temperature for the year in Georgetown is 25.6\u00a0\u00b0C (78.0\u00a0\u00b0F). The warmest month, on average, is March with an average temperature of 27.8\u00a0\u00b0C (82.0\u00a0\u00b0F). The coolest month on average is August, with an average temperature of 24.4\u00a0\u00b0C (76.0\u00a0\u00b0F).\nDemographics.\nThe human population is about 1,000, made up of civilians\nworking for the RAF and USAF, and a small number of military personnel. The personnel are mainly from the UK, USA and St Helena, none of whom are permanent residents.\nThere are five settlements:\nTwo Boats School is the only school on the island and provides education to all resident children 3\u00bd\u201316 years old."}

Before 1962, the area now covered by the Territory comprised three separate dependencies of the Falkland Islands;\nThe Territory overlaps other claims on Antarctica by Argentina and Chile\nThe Territory is inhabited largely by the staff of research and support stations operated and maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and other organisations.\nHistory.\nThe United Kingdom has had a presence in the South Atlantic since 1833 when it occupied the Falkland Islands. In 1908 the UK claimed the territory that is British Antarctic Territory today, as well as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The territory was governed as three separate dependencies; Graham Land, the South Orkneys, and the South Shetlands, administered from Falkland Islands by the Governor.\nGeography.\nIn addition to continental Antarctica, within which the BAT claim includes the Palmer Land peninsula, and the Ronne Ice Shelf, Weddell Sea, the territory also includes the South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands.\nAdministration.\nIt is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). A Commissioner is appointed and is always the Head of the FCO's Overseas Territories Department.\nThe Territory has a full suite of laws, and legal and postal administrations. Given the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System, the Territory does not enforce its laws on foreign nations who maintain scientific bases within the Territory. It is self-financing, with income from the sale of postage stamps and income tax.\nResearch.\nThe British Antarctic Survey has three permanently staffed research stations in the Territory:"}

It is in the Indian Ocean, 2600\u00a0kms northwest of Perth in Western Australia and 500\u00a0km south of Jakarta, Indonesia.\nAbout 1,600 people live on Christmas Island, mostly in a number of \"settlement areas\" on the north of the island:\nChristmas Island is far from other islands. That is why many of the plants and animals are only found on that Island. Much of it is undisturbed by humans.\nThere used to be mining on the island, but now 65% of Christmas Island is National Park.\nHistory.\nCaptain William Mynors of the British East India Company ship, the \"Royal Mary\", gave the island its name because they arrived on Christmas Day, 25 December 1643.\nThe earliest recorded visit was in March 1688 by William Dampier of the British ship \"Cygnet\". Dampier was blown away from the direction he wanted to go, and he got lost. After 28 days he arrived on Christmas Island. Two of his crewmen were the first recorded people to set foot on Christmas Island.\nThere were several visits and explorations of the island, but it was only when valuable phosphate of lime was discovered that the island was \"annexed to\" (claimed by) the British Crown on 6 June 1888.\nSettlement and exploitation.\nSoon afterwards, a small settlement was started in Flying Fish Cove by G. Clunies Ross, the owner of the Keeling Islands (some 900 kilometres to the south west) to collect timber and supplies for the growing industry on Cocos.\nPhosphate mining began in the 1890s using indentured workers from Singapore, China, and Malaysia.\nThe island was ruled jointly by the British Phosphate Commissioners and District Officers from the United Kingdom Colonial Office through the Straits Settlements, and later the Crown Colony of Singapore.\nJapanese invasion.\nJapan invaded and occupied the island in 1942, as the Indian garrison mutinied, and they interned the residents (made them stay where they were) until the end of World War II in 1945.\nTransfer to Australia.\nAustralia asked the United Kingdom to allow them to rule the island; in 1957, the Australian government paid the government of Singapore \u00a32.9 million in compensation. This amount of money was decided by guessing how much the phosphate given up by Singapore was worth.\nThe first Australian Official Representative arrived in 1958 and was replaced by an Administrator in 1968 . Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands together are called the Australian Indian Ocean Territories and since 1997 share one Administrator who lives on Christmas Island.\nSince the late 1980s boatloads of refugees have gone to Christmas Island, mostly from Indonesia. During 2001, Christmas Island received a large number of asylum seekers travelling by boat, most of them from the Middle East and intending to apply for asylum in Australia. The Norwegian cargo vessel MV \"Tampa\" rescued people from a sinking Indonesian fishing-boat \"Palapa\". The ship had 420 asylum seekers from Afghanistan, 13 from Sri Lanka, and five from Indonesia. The captain of the ship asked to let the refugees leave the ship at Christmas Island. The Australian SAS boarded and took control. The asylum seekers were sent to Nauru. Another boatload of asylum seekers was taken from Christmas Island to Papua New Guinea. It was said that many of the adult asylum seekers threw their children into the water in protest at being turned away. This was later proved to be untrue. Many of the refugees were accepted by New Zealand.\nThe Australian Parliament later passed a law to ban people who arrive on Christmas Island from being able automatically to claim refugee status. This allows the Australian navy to move them to other countries (Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, and Nauru). In 2005, the Department of Immigration began to build an \"Immigration Reception and Processing Centre\", completed in 2007 at the cost of $210 million. It has 800 beds.\nGovernment.\nChristmas Island is a non-self governing territory of Australia. The Queen of Australia is represented by an administrator appointed by the Governor-General. Neil Lucas was appointed administrator on 28 January 2006.\nFederal government services are provided through the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the Christmas Island Administration.\nThe Western Australian Government and other contractors provide state government services, but because Christmas Island is a territory the Commonwealth (federal) Australian Government pay the costs.\nThe local government is the Shire of Christmas Island. This council has 9 members, half the members are elected every two years.\nChristmas Island residents who are Australian citizens also vote in Commonwealth elections for the Northern Territory's Lingiari constituency of the House of Representatives. They are represented in the Senate by Northern Territory Senators.\nIn early 1986 the Christmas Island Assembly held a design competition for an island flag; the winning design was adopted as the informal flag of the territory for more than ten years, and in 2002 it was made the official flag of Christmas Island.\nThe annual red crab mass migration (around 100 million animals) to the sea to spawn has been called one of the wonders of the natural world and takes place each year around November; after the start of the wet season and in synchronisation with the cycle of the moon.\nTourism.\nThe Christmas Island National Park covers 63% of the island. This means that for the visitor interested in plants and animals there is a great deal to see. There is also lots of amazing marine life in the sea.\nOther websites.\nGeneral\nTourism"}

There are two atolls and twenty-seven coral islands in the group. The islands are in the Indian Ocean, about one-half of the way from Australia to Sri Lanka. \nHistory.\nCaptain William Keeling was the first European to see the islands, in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the nineteenth century, when they became a possession of the Clunies-Ross Family. Slaves were brought to work the coconut plantation from Indonesia, the Cape of Good Hope and East Asia by Alexander Hare who had taken part in Stamford Raffles' takeover of Java in 1811. A Scottish merchant seaman called Captain John Clunies-Ross, who had also served under Raffles in the takeover, set up a compound and Hare's severely mistreated slaves soon escaped to work under better conditions for Clunies-Ross. \nOn November 23 1955, the islands were transferred to Australian control under the \"Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955\". In the 1970s, Australian government dissatisfaction with the Clunies-Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased. In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of AU$6,250,000, using the threat of compulsory purchase. By agreement the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. However, in 1983 the Australian government moved to dishonour this agreement, and told the former last ruler, John Clunies-Ross, that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the High Court of Australia ruled that the government could not buy Oceania House. Instead the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be given to his shipping company, an action which contributed to his bankruptcy. John Clunies-Ross lives in exile in Perth, Australia, but his successors still live on the Cocos.\nIn 2004 there were 629 people living on the Cocos (Keeling) islands. There are about 120 Europeans on West Island and 500 Malays on Home Island. A Cocos dialect of Malay and English are the main languages spoken and 80% of Cocos Islanders are Sunni Muslim. India does not recognise Anglo annexation of these Cultural Indo-Indian/Indies islands as part of Australia and disputes it's status to counterbalance regional hegemonic sea power. \nGovernment.\nThe capital of the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands is West Island while the largest settlement is the village of Bantam (Home Island).

The Dependency has a snow runway at Williams Field, and depending on conditions and time of year, two ice runways.

If one accepts the claim, the Ross Dependency comprises the bulk of the territory of New Zealand, far larger than the North Island and the South Island combined. However, the actual amount of land mass claimed is not large; most of the area defined as being in the Ross Dependency is either in the Ross Sea or the Antarctic Ocean. It is the smallest of the claims which were made prior to the implementation of the Antarctic Treaty System and the suspension of all territorial claims to Antarctica proper.\nThe Governor-General of New Zealand is also the Governor of Ross Dependency.

Tristan da Cunha is the most remote archipelago (group of islands) and the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world; it is at from the nearest land, South Africa, and from South America.\nThe territory consists of the main island of Tristan da Cunha itself, which measures about across and has an area of , along with the uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible Island and Gough Island.\nTristan da Cunha is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. This includes Saint Helena to its north and equatorial Ascension Island even further north. The island has a permanent population of 275 (2009 figures).\nHistory.\nThe islands were first seen in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristan da Cunha (), but he did not go to land because rough seas. He gave its name to the principal island of the group () but it was soon changed by to \"Tristan da Cunha\".\nIn 1643 the crew of the Dutch ship \"Heemstede\" made the first recorded landing. In 1656 Jan van Riebeeck, the governor of Cape Town, sent a ship to the archipelago to see if it was possible to establish a military station but the project was abandoned.\nTristan da Cunha also discovered in 1506 the Inaccessible Island; its present name was given by French Capt. d'Escheverry (or d'Etchevery). In that same year, the Portuguese Gon\u00e7alo Alvarez discovered the Gough Island and named the island after him. It was re-discovered by the British Capt. Charles Gough who also gave its name to the island.\nThe Nightingale Island was discovered by Dutch sailors in 1656 and named it \"Gebroocken Eiland\". The British Capt. Gamaliel Nightingale, who visited the group in 1760, gave his name to the island.\nThe first study of the archipelago was made by the French frigate \"L'Heure du Berger\" in 1767. The results of the survey were published by A. Dalrymple in 1781.\nThe first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert, from Salem, Massachusetts, United States, who came to the islands in December 1810. He declared the islands his property and named them the \"Islands of Refreshment\". Lambert's rule was short-lived, as he died in 1812.\nIn 1816 the United Kingdom formally annexed the islands, ruling them from the Cape Colony in South Africa. It was a measure to ensure that the French would be unable to use the islands as a base for a rescue operation to free Napoleon Bonaparte from his prison on Saint Helena. The occupation also prevented the United States from using Tristan da Cunha as a base, as they had during the War of 1812.\nIn 1867, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and second son of Queen Victoria, visited the islands. The main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, was named in honour of his visit. Lewis Carroll's youngest brother, the Rev. Edwin H. Dodgson, served as an Anglican missionary and school teacher in Tristan da Cunha in the 1880s.\nOn 12 January 1938, the Tristan da Cunha archipelago was made a dependency of Saint Helena. In 1981, the British government changed the status of Saint\u00a0Helena and the other Crown colonies to \"British Dependent Territories\".\nThe 1961 eruption of Queen Mary's Peak forced the evacuation of the entire population via Cape Town to England. The following year a Royal Society expedition went to the islands to assess the damage, and reported that the settlement of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had been only marginally affected. Most families returned in 1963.\nIn 2009, Saint Helena and its two territories received equal status under a new constitution, and the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nGeography.\nThe islands of Tristan da Cunha are the peaks of volcanoes associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At 200,000 years old, the main island is the youngest of the group, while Nightingale is the oldest: 12 million years. Inaccessible and Gough are 3 to 5 million years old.\nTristan da Cunha is the name of the archipelago and of the main island of the group; the archipelago consists of the following islands:\nInaccessible Island and the Nightingale Islands are located southwest of the main island, while Gough Island is located south-southeast. The main island is quite mountainous; the only flat area is the location of the capital, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, on the northwest coast. The highest point is a volcano called Queen Mary's Peak ; it is covered by snow in winter. The other islands of the group are uninhabited, except for the weather station on Gough Island, which has been operated by South Africa since 1956 (since 1963 at its present location at Transvaal Bay on the southeast coast), with a staff of six.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the islands is temperate and oceanic, with a mean air temperature at sea level at Tristan of 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F), with relatively small daily and seasonal variation. On Gough it is a few degrees colder. Rainfall is high: 1700\u00a0mm annually at the Tristan Settlement, and 3300\u00a0mm at Gough. Strong winds are common. Mean wind speed is about 40\u00a0km/h. Wind speed increases strongly with altitude, while temperature decreases. Thus, while the lowlands experience quite pleasant weather, the uplands may be covered in snow or battered by very strong winds.\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification subtype for the climate in Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is Cfb (Marine West Coast Climate).\nThe average temperature for the year in Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, with an elevation of 23 m, is 13.9\u00a0\u00b0C (57.0\u00a0\u00b0F). The warmest month, on average, is February with an average temperature of 17.8\u00a0\u00b0C (64.0\u00a0\u00b0F). The coolest month on average is August, with an average temperature of 10.6\u00a0\u00b0C (51.0\u00a0\u00b0F).\nThe average amount of precipitation for the year in Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is 1612.9\u00a0mm. The month with the most precipitation on average is August with 160\u00a0mm of precipitation. The month with the least precipitation on average is February with an average of 91.4\u00a0mm.\nDemographics.\nThe islands have a population of about 275. The only settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas (known locally as \"The Settlement of Edinburgh\" or, more common, just \"The Settlement\"). The only religion is Christianity, with denominations of Anglican and Roman Catholic. The current population is thought to have descended from 15 ancestors, eight males and seven females, who arrived on the island at various times between 1816 and 1908. The male founders originated from Scotland, England, The Netherlands, the United States and Italy and share just eight surnames: Glass (Scottish), Green (Dutch), Hagan (Irish), Lavarello (Italian, a typical Ligurian surname), Patterson (Scottish), Repetto (Italian, another typical Ligurian surname), Rogers (English) and Swain (English)."}

Frozen dinners are prepared in bulk, cooked until ready to serve, divided into single servings for freezing, to be reheated later. An entr\u00e9e of meat or other protein is included, along with vegetables, a carbohydrate food (such as potatoes or rice), and a sweet dessert.\nFrozen dinners are helpful for people who do not have time to cook, or who lack meal-planning or cooking skills. They are also known as \"TV dinners\", because they were long advertised as suitable to warm up and eat while watching television. Both inventions became popular at around the same time (during the 1950s), and each one sold more of the other.\nFor many years, frozen dinners came packaged with a shaped aluminium foil cooking tray. This made them easy to reheat in a normal gas or electric stove's oven. The trays were sometimes reused or recycled by users. When microwave ovens became common, frozen dinners could not be cooked in them because the metal tray would damage the oven. Early packaged foods for the microwave often could not be cooked in a regular oven, because the heat would make the package catch fire or fall apart. New packaging had to be developed, so the same frozen dinner could be heated in both kinds of ovens. This succeeded during the 1980s. Some new trays can be reused, while others are made of paper and meant to be thrown away.\nThe quality of food in frozen dinners has also improved steadily through the years. Early potato dishes would sometimes have a chalk-like quality to them, and vegetables poor texture. Newer dinners taste much more like they are freshly cooked. Vegetarian meals have also been introduced. Linda McCartney started a popular line of frozen vegetarian dishes during the 1990s."}

It was mainly in the Valley of Oaxaca of southern Mesoamerica. Archaeologists think their culture goes back at least 2500 years. The Zapotec left traces at the ancient city of Monte Alb\u00e1n. There are buildings, ball courts, magnificent tombs and grave goods. In the graves, finely worked gold jewellery was found. Monte Alb\u00e1n was the first major city in the western hemisphere. It was the center of a Zapotec state that dominated much of what is now the state of Oaxaca.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Zapotec\" comes from Nahuatl \"tzapot\u0113cah\" (singular \"tzapot\u0113catl\"). This word means \"inhabitants of the place of sapote\". The Zapotec referred to themselves as \"Be'ena'a\", which means \"The People.\"\nTechnology.\nThe Zapotec developed a calendar and a special system of writing. This system has a separate glyph for each of the syllables of the language. It is one of several candidates thought to have been the first writings system of Mesoamerica. It is the predecessor of the writing systems developed by the Maya, Mixtec, and Aztec civilizations. Currently there is some debate if Olmec symbols, dated to 650 BC, are actually a form of writing which is older than the earliest Zapotec writing dated to about 500 BC.\nIn the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, there were Zapotec and Mixtec artisans who made jewellery for the Aztec rulers (\"tlatoanis\"), including Moctezuma II. Relations with central Mexico go back much further. This can be proven by archaeological remains of a Zapotec neighborhood within Teotihuacan and a Teotihuacan style \"guest house\" in Monte Alb\u00e1n. Other important pre-Columbian Zapotec sites include Lambityeco, Dainzu, Mitla, Yagul, San Jos\u00e9 Mogote, El Palmillo and Zaachila.\nThe Zapotec were a sedentary culture. They were a well-advanced in civilization, living in large villages and towns, in houses constructed with stone and mortar. They recorded the principal events in their history by means of hieroglyphics, and in warfare they made use of a cotton armour. The well-known ruins of Mitla have been attributed to them and were claimed to be the tombs of their ancestors.\nReligion.\nLike most Mesoamerican religious systems, the Zapotec religion was polytheistic. Two principal deities include Cocijo, the rain god (similar to the Aztec god Tlaloc), and Coquihani, the god of light. It is believed that the Zapotec sometimes used human sacrifice in their rituals.\nThe Zapotecs tell that their ancestors emerged from the earth, from caves, or that they turned from trees or jaguars into people, while the elite that governed them believed that they descended from supernatural beings that lived among the clouds, and that upon death they would return to such status. In fact, the name by which Zapotecs are known today resulted from this belief. In Central Valley Zapotec \"The Cloud People' is \"Be'ena' Za'a.\"\nWarfare.\nThe last battle between the Aztecs and the Zapotecs occurred between 1497 and 1502, under the Aztec ruler Ahuizotl. At the time of Spanish conquest of Mexico, when news arrived that the Aztecs were defeated by the Spaniards, King Cosijoeza ordered his people not to confront the Spaniards so they would avoid the same fate. They were defeated by the Spaniards only after several campaigns between 1522 and 1527. However, uprisings against colonial authorities occurred in 1550, 1560, and 1715.\nIn 1850 there was another rebellion against the local government of Oaxaca, followed in 1866 by one against the Royal French Army, during the French invasion of Mexico. In recent times, there was an uprising against the local governor Manuel Z\u00e1rate Aquino in the late 1970s."}

The Olmec were the first civilization in the ancient area known as Mesoamerica. Because they were the first civilization, many later Mesoamerican civilizations used and repeated Olmec features and characteristics. \nThe Olmec people discovered and made use of many natural resources in the area, including rubber and corn. Dozens of mysterious stone heads were discovered in the Olmec territory as well; archaeologists are still not sure what their purposes were.\nOverview.\nThe Olmecs lived from 1200 BC to about 400 BC. They had two important cities, first San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan and then La Venta. The Olmecs were able to thrive due to the fertile land around the Coatzacoalcos river basin. The reason for the fall of the Olmec empire is unknown. They developed many different cultures.\nArt.\nThe Olmecs created a range of artwork such as altars, jade masks and stone carvings.\nColossal heads.\nThe Olmec colossal heads are the most recognized symbol of the Olmec civilization. The height and weights of the heads vary, but the largest head is about twice the height of an average human male. They include seventeen heads found in the southern Mexican cities of La Venta, San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, Tres Zapotes, and Rancho la Cobata. Each head shows a unique facial expression and wears a helmet bearing distinctive decorations. No two are alike. The origins and meaning of the heads are mysterious, and they are the subject of much speculation among scholars and archaeologists.\nScholars have tried to explain how the Olmecs might have made and moved such big objects. The heads were sculpted out of a hard, dense rock called basalt. Archaeologists think the Olmecs found most of the basalt in the Tuxtlas Mountain range. According to this theory, the basalt heads were sculpted roughly in the mountains and then either floated or dragged by thousands of people from the construction site to the Olmec cities. \nPerhaps the most notable features of the sculptures \u2013 and a clue as to their meaning \u2013 are the helmets worn by all the Olmec heads. These helmets, and the rubber balls found near the sculptures, may be evidence that the Mesoamerican ball game originated with the Olmec civilization. The Mesoamerican ball game was a team sport with profound religious and cultural significance for the indigenous people of Mexico and Central America. The Olmec heads were once thought to have represented Mesoamerican ball players who were sacrificed after losing a match. The current theory, however, is that the heads honor Olmec rulers."}

Merckx, regarded as the greatest and most successful cyclist of all time, established several world cycling records, some of which remain unbroken to this day.\nRacing career.\nEarly successes in stage racing and single day races.\nMerckx started competing in 1961. Three years later he became Amateur World Champion. He turned professional in 1965. In 1966 he won the first of seven editions of Milan-Sanremo. He started his first grand tour at the 1967 \"Giro d'Italia\". He won his first stage here and finished seventh overall. Later that year he outsprinted Jan Janssen to become Professional World Champion at Heerlen, The Netherlands. He was world champion twice more.\nIn 1968 Merckx moved to the Italian \"Faema\" team. As world champion he wore the rainbow jersey and won the Paris-Roubaix race for the first time. He also won the \"Giro d'Italia\" . He won the \"Giro\" three more times.\nStarting the 1969 season, he won Paris-Nice stage race. In the time trial, he overtook the five-time Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil. Anquetil was so good at time trailing many people thought he was unbeatable. Merckx went on to win Milan-Sanremo and Ronde van Vlaanderen several weeks later.\nIn his \"Tour de France\" debut (first entry) in 1969, Merckx immediately won the yellow jersey (overall leader), the green jersey (best sprinter) and the red polka-dotted jersey (\"King of the Mountains\" - best climber in the mountain stages). No other cyclist has won the three jerseys in one \"Tour de France\", and only Tony Romingerin 1993 and Laurent Jalabert in 1995 have been able to match this feat in any Grand Tour (cycling). Both were in the Tour of Spain. Merckx was only 24, so would have won the white jersey (for best rider under 25 years of age) but the Tour de France did not give a white jersey until the 1970s.\nEddy Merkx was the first Belgian to win the Tour de France since Sylv\u00e8re Maes in 1939. Merckx became a national hero. He won the Tour four more times: in 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1974, equalling Jacques Anquetil. Over the next 25 years, only Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain were able to equal the five victories. Merckx still holds the records for stage wins (34) and number of days in the Yellow Jersey (96).\nChallenges to Merckx's domination in the Grand Tours.\nThe greatest challenge to Merckx was in the 1971 Tour de France. Luis Ocana attacked and won the maillot jaune by several minutes. Ocana held his lead until he crashed and had to abandon (leave) the tour. Many people hoped they would race against each other again.of a rematch between the two.\nBefore that could happen, Merckx raced in the 1972 edition of the Giro d'Italia and beat the mountain racing expert Jose Manuel Fuente in the mountain stages. In that year's Tour de France Ocana was sick and withdrew.\nIn 1973 Merckx rode in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a where he beat Luis Ocana and Bernard Th\u00e9venet and then went on to win the Giro d'Italia. Merckx's final victory in the Giro d'Italia in the 1974 edition was a tight battle between Merckx and two Italians. In the end, Merckx won by the very narrow margin of twelve seconds over Gianbattista Baronchelli and 33\u00a0seconds over Felice Gimondi.\nClassics victories.\nIn addition to Grand Tour successes, Merckx has a long list of victories in one-day races. Among the highlights are\nThat is a total of 19 victories in the Classics. He also won the \"World Road Racing Championship\" a record three times in 1967, 1971 and 1974, and every Classic except Paris-Tours. Finally, he won 17 \"six-day\" track races, often with Patrick Sercu.\nMerckx retired from racing in 1978, at the age of 33.\nSetbacks and lesser days.\nThe blackest day in Merckx's career was in 1969, when he crashed in a derny race towards the end of the season. A pacer and a cyclist fell in front of Merckx's pacer, Fernand Wambst. Wambst and Merckx crashed. Wambst was killed instantly, and Merckx suffered concussion and fell unconscious. This accident cracked a vertebra and twisted his pelvis. Afterwards he said his riding was never the same, because he always be in pain, especially while climbing.\nThat same year, during the \"Giro d'Italia\", was found to have used drugs and disqualified. He cried in front of reporters and still protests his innocence. He argued that there were no counter-experts nor counter-analysis and that foreign supporters hated him. Further, he stated that the stage during which he was allegedly using drugs was an easy one, so there was no need to use drugs. The Belgian prince sent a plane to bring him to Belgium. This incident was one of the reasons why Merckx thought his first \"Tour de France\" victory, later that year, his best ever win\nThe end of his Tour-career came in 1975 (although he did compete in 1977 he finished 6th that year). That year, he attempted to win his sixth but became a victim of violence. Many Frenchmen were upset that a Belgian might beat the record five wins set by Jacques Anquetil. Merckx held the yellow jersey for eight days, which raised his record to 96 days, but during stage 14 a French spectator punched him in the liver. A later collision with the Danish rider Ole Ritter broke his jaw. Although he could not eat solid food and was barely able to talk, Merckx did not retire. During the last stage, he attacked leader Bernard Thevenet (but was caught by the peloton).\nRecords.\nMerckx set these records during his career.\nHour record.\nMerckx set the hour record in October 25, 1972. He covered 49.431\u00a0km at high altitude in Mexico City. The record was unbeaten until 1984, when Francesco Moser broke it using a specially designed bicycle. During the next 15 years, various racers improved the record to more than 56\u00a0km. However, because of the more and more strange designs of the bikes and position of the rider, in 2000 the UCI said a \"traditional\" bike must be used. When Chris Boardman had another go at Merckx's reinstated record in 2000, he beat it by slightly more than 10\u00a0metres at sea level. But, Merckx had raced a full road season winning the Tour, Giro and four Classics, while Boardman was a time trial specialist who had retired from road racing and had prepared specially for the 2000\u00a0Hour Record.\nAfter retirement.\nHaving retired, Merckx has a bicycle factory and is a race commentator. He was coach of the Belgian national cycling team during the mid-90s, and part of the Belgian Olympic Committee. Merckx is still asked to comment as an authority on cycling. As such, he has also figured as special advisor for the recent UCI addition \"Tour of Qatar\" since 2002.\nIn May 2004, he underwent an oesophagus operation to cure the constant stomach ache which he suffered since he was a young man. He lost almost 30\u00a0kg in the process, and started cycling again, but only for leisure.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1967 Merckx married Claudine Acou. Merckx's mother asked the priest to celebrate the ceremony in French, a choice that ended up being a contentious issue in Belgium. They had two children: a daughter (Sabrina), and a son (Axel) who was a professional cyclist for Team T-Mobile.\nDespite this early incident, Merckx is a perfect ambassador to Belgium (because he does not support Flanders more than Wallonia, but supports the unity of the country). Because of this, he came 4th in the Walloon version of the \"Greatest Belgian\" contest in 2005, and third in the Flemish (3rd) version..\nIn 1996 the Belgian king gave him the title of baron. In 2000 he was chosen Belgian \"Sports Figure of the Century\".\nMerckx is known as a quiet and modest person. Many of his former helpers have worked in his bicycle factory and join him during recreational bike tours.\nMerckx has condemned doping (he tested positive twice in his career). At the same time he has been quick to point out that cycling is unfairly treated when compared to other sports. In the 1990s, he became a friend of Lance Armstrong and supported him when he was accused of drug use, stating he \"believed what Lance told him than what appeared in newspapers\". After Armstrong won his third Tour de France, Merckx predicted he would go on to win as many as seven.\nDoping.\nMerckx twice tested positive for doping in his career. Because he has admitted doing this publicly the city of Stuttgart, Germany did not want to invite him to the world cycling championships being held in the city in 2007"}

The plants also have aerial roots. These can act as hooks on branches of the tree that the plant is climbing. They grow down into the ground to support the plant. The leaves are leather, dark green, and often have holes in them. The flowers grow on a special inflorescence called a spadix.

West-moving waves can also form from the tail end of frontal zones in the subtropics and tropics and may be called to as easterly waves, but these waves are not properly called tropical waves; they are a form of inverted trough sharing many characteristics with fully tropical waves. All tropical waves form in the easterly flow along the southern side of the subtropical ridge or belt of high pressure which is north and south of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Tropical waves are normally carried westward by the prevailing easterly winds along the tropics and subtropics near the equator. They can lead to the formation of tropical cyclones in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific Oceans. They can also lead to tropical storms which can also lead to hurricanes.\nCharacteristics.\nA tropical wave is usually preceded by an area of sinking, intensely dry air, sloping as a northeast wind. With the passage of the trough line, the wind turns to the southeast, the humidity suddenly rises, and the atmosphere destabilizes, producing widespread showers and thunderstorms, sometimes severe. As the wave moves off westward, the showers slowly stop.\nA notable exception to the general characteristic of widespread precipitation behind a tropical wave occurs in the Atlantic. Periodically, a surge of intensely dry air known as the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is entrained behind a tropical wave, resulting in cloudless or nearly cloudless skies as convection is limited by the dry layer inversion. Also, any dust which may be present within the SAL reflects solar radiation, slightly cooling the atmosphere below it.\nAtlantic.\nTropical waves in the Atlantic Ocean form from disturbances which drift off the continent of Africa onto the Atlantic Ocean. These are generated or enhanced by the African Easterly Jet. The clockwise circulation of the large transoceanic high-pressure cell or anticyclone centered near the Azores islands impels easterly waves away from the coastal areas of Africa to North America. About 60% of Atlantic tropical cyclones originally form from tropical waves, while about 85% of intense Atlantic hurricanes (Category 3 and greater) form from tropical waves.\nTropical cyclones can sometimes degenerate back into a tropical wave. This normally happens if upper-level wind shear is too strong. The storm can redevelop if the upper level shear decreases or stops. If a tropical wave is moving quickly, it can have strong winds of over tropical storm force, but is not considered a tropical storm unless it has a closed circulation.\nEast Pacific.\nIt has been suggested that eastern Pacific Ocean tropical cyclones are formed out of tropical waves that come from North Africa as well. During the summer months, tropical waves can go northward as far as the desert southwest of the United States, producing spells of intensified shower activity surrounded within the current monsoon area."}

For example, the world road race champion would wear the jersey while competing in stage races and one-day races, but would not during time trials. Similarly, on the track, the world individual pursuit champion would only wear the jersey when competing in other individual pursuit events.\nA champion who does not wear the rainbow jersey can be fined 2500 to 5000 Swiss francs.\nThe team's sponsor pays a lot of money to have their name on each rider's jersey. They can still put their names on the world champion's jersey, but probably smaller because there is less space. Sponsors do not mind because the world champion gets a lot more publicity than ordinary riders.\nA world champion who is leading a stage race wears the race-leader's jersey, not the world champion's, but only while he is the leader."}

It was one of the ten UCI Road World Cup races and became part of the UCI ProTour. It is one of the 'Classic cycle races' has the nickname \"The Hell of the North\" .\nHistory.\nParis-Roubaix is one of the oldest professional bicycle races. Th\u00e9o Vienne and Maurice Perez got the idea to run the race and in 1896, the sports newspaper Le V\u00e9lo worked out original route between Paris and Roubaix. The race has been contested every year since 1896, stopped only by the two World wars.\nThe first edition of the race was held at Easter, April 19 1896, so it got the nickname of \"La Pascale\"(English: \"The Easter\").\n188 competitors left the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris and raced almost 300\u00a0kilometres to Roubaix. Josef Fischer, the winner of this first edition, received 1000 francs.\nThe race is now organised by the media group Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) who also run the Tour de France.\nRiders are often covered from head to toe in mud and grit, and race over the cobblestoned roads and hard rutted tracks of northern France. However, the race got the nickname \"l'enfer du Nord\", or the \"Hell of the North\" from journalists who watched the race after world war I, and saw it pass through many of the ruins, craters, and destruction along the way.\nOriginally, the race was from Paris to Roubaix, but in 1966 the starting location was moved to Chantilly, 50\u00a0kilometres to the north of Paris, to be moved in 1977 to Compi\u00e8gne, approximately 80\u00a0kilometres to the north of Paris. Famous for rough terrain, the route of Paris-Roubaix is adjusted slightly from year to year as the older roads are resurfaced and the race organisers seek to replace them with other challenging cobbles, to maintain the character of the race - in 2005, for example, the race included 54.7\u00a0kilometres of cobbled sections. The race finishes with 750\u00a0meters on the smooth concrete expanses of the large outdoor velodrome in Roubaix.\nThe bicycles of Paris-Roubaix.\nDue to its challenging course, and poor weather conditions, Paris-Roubaix presents a challenge to riders, team support personnel, and equipment alike. Special frames and wheels are often used specifically for Paris-Roubaix, in various configurations depending on the weather conditions."}

Asexual people usually do not have sexual attraction towards anyone, no matter what gender they are. Asexuality has nothing to do with a person's romantic/aesthetic/sensual attraction. The opposite of an asexual is an \"allosexual\". Allosexuality means that you feel sexual desires.\nMeaning.\nAsexuality is described as a spectrum. Demisexual people are on the asexual spectrum. They feel sexual attraction, but only to people who they feel a connection to. About 1% of people identify as asexual. Alfred Kinsey used the label \"X\" to describe asexual people. Grey-asexual people are people who feel like they are not asexual, but they're not sexual either. For example, a grey-asexual person doesn't feel sexual attraction often. Some asexuals also identify with a romantic identity as well, meaning they may feel the need to form relationships, while others may not. Some asexual people identify as queer. However, some people think that 'queer' is not an appropriate word for asexual people. Not having sex (celibacy), is not always asexuality. Some homosexuals, for example, don't want to have sex because they feel guilty about their sexual attraction. \nStudies.\nIn 2001, David Jay started the Asexual Visibility and Education Network. A 2012 study found that asexual people are just as discriminated against as gay men, lesbians, or bisexuals people. Asexuality has only recently been studied. One writer, S.E. Smith speculates that it has not increased, its just people have only just started noticing it. Acceptance of asexuality as a subject of scientific has only begun recently. \nLibido.\nLibido, or sex drive, is the sexual arousal that humans feel. Some asexual people have a libido, this does not mean they are allosexual. They feel it as the body just doing it's thing, and often masturbate to relieve it.\nRomantic Orientation.\nSome asexual people are aromantic. This means that they do not feel romantic attraction such as getting a crush on someone. Others can be homoromantic, heteroromantic, biromantic, etc."}

Often this is due to exposure to weather. The word \"patina\" comes from the Latin word meaning \"shallow dish\". For many works of art the patina adds to its value. In many cases, the artist wanted the work to acquire a patina over time.\nNatural patina.\nA patina layer takes many years to develop under natural weathering. Buildings in damp climates will develop patina layers faster than ones in dry areas. The facades of many buildings are made of copper, brass or bronze, for example. These will produce different colors after natural weathering.\nCopper takes on a natural green or blue-green patina. Bronze takes on a brown color. Early civilizations used bronze extensively. The Bronze Age is named for it. In the United States, bronze was rarely used in buildings before the American Civil War. Marble, especially white marble, was used in classical Greek and Roman statues. It takes on a light golden patina over time. \nOften, antique and well-used firearms will develop a patina on the steel after the bluing, parkerizing, or other finish has worn off. Firearms in this condition are generally considered more valuable than ones that have been re-blued or parkerized. The patina protects the firearm from the more damaging rust that would occur if the patina were polished off. Rust is sometimes valued as a patina. Examples are rat rods, custom cars and meant to look like early 1940s hot rods. They glorify rusted hot rods that have an almost cartoonish appearance. Some are actually rusted metal while others have a faux (false) finish intended to look like rust.\nFaux patinas.\nCopper items, lamps, fixtures and outdoor projects can be made to look weathered by use of paints or chemicals. For example, a 50/50 mix of ammonia and white vinegar will give copper an aged patina. Architects and craftspeople use copper sulfate on copper items to make them look old. Patina Green is another product used to give copper an instant aged look. Woodworkers and wood finishers mix their own wood stains. This is to match finishes on wood furniture to the same color, tone and patina of the original finish."}

The best woodcuts and copper-plates were published.\nLater painting experiences.\nMore honour was given to Cranach when he went to the Netherlands in 1509, and painted the Emperor Maximilian I and the boy who became Charles V later in his life. Until 1508 Cranach signed his works with the initials of his name. In that year the person in charge gave him the snake with wings as a symbol. This symbol was marked on all his pictures after that date.\nDeath.\nLucas Cranach the Elder died on 16 October 1553 at Weimar in Germany. The house in which he lived still stands in the marketplace. He is commemorated as an artist by the Lutheran Church on 6 April.\nCranach's Art.\nInfluences.\nCranach's art in its prime was slightly affected by the art of the Italians, but was also similar to that of the Netherlands and Germans.\nCompositions.\nAs a composer Cranach was not greatly gifted. His concept of the human shape was low; but he showed some freshness in the contour of incident, though he not unfrequently bordered on coarseness. His copper-plates and woodcuts are the best pieces of his art; and the earlier they are in date the more apparent is their power. Striking evidence of this is the \"St Christopher\" of 1506, or the plate of \"Elector Frederick praying before the Madonna\" (1509).\nEarly work.\nHis first woodcut (1505) represents the Virgin and three saints in prayer before a crucifix. Later on he composes the marriage of St Catherine, a series of martyrdoms, and scenes from the Passion.\nReligious work.\nAfter 1517 he occasionally draws the old gospel themes, but he also gives style to some of the thoughts of the Reformers. In a picture of 1518 at Leipzig, where a dying man offers \"his soul to God, his body to earth, and his worldly goods to his relations,\" the soul rises to meet the Trinity in heaven, and being saved is clearly shown to depend on faith and not on good works. Again sin and grace become a familiar subject of description in pictures. Adam is observed sitting between John the Baptist and a prophet at the foot of a tree. To the left God brings out the tables of the law, Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit, the serpent is holding his head up high, and punishment takes place in the shape of death and the realm of Satan. To the right, the birth, Crucifixion and Resurrection symbolize achievement, and this is duly impressed on Adam by John the Baptist, who points to the sacrifice of the crucified Saviour. There are two examples of this work in the galleries of Gotha and Prague, both of them dated 1529.\nSons.\nCranach had three sons, all artists: John Lucas Cranach, who died at Bologna in 1536; Hans Cranach, whose life is obscure; and Lucas Cranach the younger (1515-1586) who took over his father's workshop after his death. He also had a daughter Barbara Cranach, married to Christian Br\u00fcck (Pontanus), ancestors of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe."}

Dover Area School District, et al. is the full name of a 2005 American trial. It is also called the Dover trial, because it happened in Dover, Pennsylvania. It said that intelligent design was not science, and could not be taught as science in schools.\nAbout.\nIntelligent design is the idea that the universe is not simple enough to be made by nature. Instead, people who believe in intelligent design think that a smarter force must have made everything, or at least important parts of it.\nTrial.\nEvolution is the commonly accepted scientific theory that explains how all of the different kinds of life developed from a simple beginning. Intelligent design is another explanation saying that life was developed by a smarter being. A school district in Dover, Pennsylvania wanted to tell the students about intelligent design. They wanted teachers to tell their students about intelligent design at the same time they taught evolution. They were using a text book from the Foundation for Thought and Ethics called \"Of Pandas and People\" written by Percival Davis and Dean Kenyon. This book says it presents the scientific evidence for intelligent design and why it makes more sense than evolution. Tammy Kitzmiller and ten other parents did not want their children being taught intelligent design. They complained to the government, and a trial was held.\nBefore the trial.\nThere was an earlier trial called \"Edwards v. Aguillard\". It was about teaching creationism in schools. Creationism is the belief that God (or something else) created the universe, like it says in the Bible or other religious books.\nThe United States Constitution is the set of rules that all of the government in the United States must follow. It does not allow the government to support one religion more than any other religion. Schools run by the government (public schools) cannot teach one type of religion as being true. In \"Edwards v. Aguillard\", the United States Supreme Court said that creationism was not science. It said it was religious, because it tried to explain things using stories from the Bible. The Supreme Court said that creationism could not be taught in public schools. But some people said intelligent design was not creationism.\nDuring the trial.\nDuring the trial, experts showed that intelligent design was an old argument for religion and not science. They looked at the authors' notes for the book, \"Of Pandas and People\", that the school was using. These notes included things that had been changed when the book was being prepared for printing. It had been changed from being about creationism to being about intelligent design. The authors did this by changing the words \"created\" to \"designed\" and \"creationists\" to \"intelligent design proponents\". In one version, the word \"creationists\" was even changed to \"cdesign proponentsists\" by mistake. The judge found this interesting. These changes were made just after Edwards v. Aguillard said you could not teach creationism in schools. The judge said this showed that intelligent design was creationism.\nIn one part of the trial, they spoke to Michael Behe. Behe was one of the people that helped create intelligent design. He said nobody could say how evolution made the immune system, the thing in your body that protects you from diseases. He said that some smarter force had to have made it. Behe was shown 58 articles, nine books, and lots of other things scientists wrote to show how the immune system could have been made by evolution. He said none of them was \"good enough\". The judge did not think this was true.\nResult.\nAfter the trial, the judge said that intelligent design was creationism, not science. Creationism had already been shown to be religious. The government is not allowed to support one religion more than any other religion. Therefore, schools can not teach intelligent design, as that would be saying one type of religion was true."}

This drag force is always opposite to the object's motion, and unlike friction between solid surfaces, the drag force increases as the object moves faster.\nAir resistance, also known as drag, is a force that is caused by air, the force acts in the opposite direction to an object moving through the air. It is where air particles hit the front of the object slowing it down. The more surface area, the more air particles hit it and the greater the resistance.\nThings are often shaped to make less drag. For example, a truck with a flat front will experience high air resistance while a sports car with a streamlined shape will experience lower air resistance, allowing the car to go faster. This is why airplanes and other fast machines are streamlined, and the same is true of fish. A snowflake falls more slowly than does a drop of water of the same weight.\nDrag can affect the quickest falling speed (the terminal velocity) of an object. The higher the drag, the slower the object falls."}

They are sometimes known as sea cows. The manatees form the genus Trichechus. There are three manatee species.\nThe name comes from the Spanish \"manat\u00ed\", which itself comes from a Carib word meaning \"breast\".\nEarly sightings.\nChristopher Columbus, who thought mermaids were real, went to the waters around Haiti, and wrote in his logbook that he had seen three mermaids. He said that they were not as beautiful as everybody said they were. Nowadays, people believe Christopher Columbus had actually seen three manatees. It is possible he saw them kissing one another, which is something they do when the meet each other in the water.\nDescription.\nManatees have thick pads around their lips and stiff bristles that help them grab food and move it towards the mouth. A manatee eats sea grass and all kinds of sea vegetables. All its teeth are shaped like a human's molars. The eight hours of chewing each day wears down on their teeth. In fact, its first two pairs of teeth get so worn out that they simply fall out sometimes. However, manatees can grow new teeth. New teeth are always growing in the back. When front teeth fall out, the back teeth move forward to take their place. In mammals, only elephants and (quite independently) kangaroos have this kind of system.\nTaxonomy.\nThe Sirenia are thought to have evolved from four-legged land mammals over 60 million years ago. Their closest living relatives are the Proboscidea (elephants) and Hyracoidea (hyraxes).\nHabitat.\nManatees live on the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the rivers. \nThe West African Manatee lives on the western side of Africa, on the shores from Senegal to Angola. They also live in some rivers like the Niger River and around Lake Chad. \nThe West Indian Manatee lives in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and also on the shores of Brazil and Venezuela. \nThe Amazonian Manatee lives in parts of the Amazon Basin in South America.\nManatees live in salt water and in fresh water. On the sea shores they mostly live in shallow water, like lagoons and mangroves. They also live in brackish water and rivers. Manatees like bodies of water with a temperature of over 20\u00a0\u00b0C. \nLife.\nThey are mainly herbivores, spending most of their time grazing in shallow waters at depths of 1-2 metres (3\u20137\u00a0ft)."}

This includes the geology of the places in which they live.\nThe work of naturalists is observation, interpretation, collecting and classification, rather than experiments. People who study natural history are called naturalists. They were among the first to explore the world. They were the first to study the Amazon and other tropical places. Naturalists find new species and classify plants and animals. They study ecology.\nNaturalists developed some theoretical ideas which were valuable. They noticed that living things fitted the lives they led. This was adaptation. They noticed a struggle for existence between animals. They thought they could see a chain of being from lower animals to higher, which they thought was the work of God. The idea that such things might happen by natural means began to surface in the 18th century, and become the majority view in time of Charles Darwin.\nBefore Darwin, most naturalists did not think of themselves as scientists. When they looked at nature, perhaps as explorers, they looked at everything. They looked at the land, the people, the plants and animals. After Darwin, they did see themselves as scientists. Early on, Darwin called himself a geologist. Thomas Henry Huxley was an anatomist. Joseph Dalton Hooker was a botanist. Charles Lyell was a geologist. They changed the way in which they were educated as well. They often took degrees in science. That sort of education was rare before Darwin.\nNaturalists were educated amateurs; scientists are trained professionals. The change happened slowly, during the 19th century. The very word \"scientist\" was invented in 1837 by William Whewell. Before then, the term was \"natural philosopher\" (for the physical sciences) or \"natural historian\" (for the biological sciences and geology). \"Naturalist\" is short for \"natural historian\".\nImportant naturalists.\nSome of the people who are important because they were interested in natural history are:"}

It is also used as a word which talks about someone's sexuality or gender in a deliberately non-specific way.\nQueer is mostly used by younger LGBT people to describe themselves and is usually described as a \"fluid\" label.

During these glaciations, much of the world we know was covered by ice: North America down to and past the Great Lakes; all of northern Russia, and Europe; England down to the Thames.\nMany animals that lived then have become extinct.

He is the great-grandson of Louis XIV whom he succeeded at age of five. He was called \"The Beloved\" (French: le Bien-Aim\u00e9). His failure to provide strong leadership and badly needed reforms contributed to the crisis that brought on the French Revolution.\nEarly life and reign.\nLouis was born at Versailles on 15 February 1710, the son of Louis, Dauphin of France and his mother Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy. Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, Regent of France, governed as regent until Louis reached his legal majority in 1723. In 1725 the king married Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, daughter of Stanis\u0142aw I of Poland. The following year his former tutor, Andr\u00e9 Hercule de Fleury, became the chief minister. Fleury gave France a stable administration until his death 17 years later. Thereafter Louis himself was in nominal control, but he took only a sporadic interest in government and never followed any consistent policy at home or abroad. He was frequently influenced by his mistresses, the most powerful of whom was the marquise de Pompadour. \nWars and death.\nFrance was involved in three wars during Louis's reign. As a result of the first, the War of the Polish Succession (1733-35), France gained the province of Lorraine. The second, the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48), which marked the beginning of a colonial struggle with Britain, was indecisive. In the last, the Seven Years' War (1756-63), France, crippled by corruption and mismanagement, lost most of its overseas possessions to the British. French foreign policy in this period was made chaotic by Louis's \u201csecret diplomacy,\u201d as his agents in other countries sometimes pursued aims that were in conflict with those of his own ministers. The situation improved somewhat in the 1760s, when a new minister, the duc de Choiseul, restored some order to the government and tried to repair the damage done by the Seven Years' War. In the last years of his reign, Louis cooperated with his chancellor, Ren\u00e9 de Maupeou, in an effort to reform the country's inequitable and inefficient system of taxation. In 1771 the parlements, or sovereign courts, which had opposed reform, were reorganized and stripped of their power to obstruct royal decrees. Measures were then implemented to tax the previously exempt nobility and clergy, but these were reversed after the king's death at Versailles on 10 May 1774. Louis XV died of smallpox as a defeated and unpopular king. He was succeeded by his grandson, Louis XVI, who was later guillotined during the French Revolution."}

Two teams of 15 players play against each other. The ball used is oval in shape. The field is a rectangle shape. It is 100 metres long and 70 meters wide. At the ends of the field are two H-shaped goal-posts which you have to score next to or underneath. \nThe game is played for 80 minutes in two 40-minute halves but there is an overtime if it goes on long enough.\nPoint Scoring.\nA try is scored when a player 'scores'. A try is worth 5 points. To score a try the player must put down the ball in the 'try area'. The try area is behind the goal-posts. \nOnce a try has been scored, the team has a chance to score extra points. The goal kicker kicks the ball towards the goal-posts. The ball must pass between the two upright goal-posts and above the cross-piece. If it does, the team is awarded 2 additional points. This act is known as a 'conversion'. \nAnother method of scoring points is through penalties. When a team breaks the rules, the referee may award a penalty. The goal-kicker kicks towards the goal-posts. The ball must pass between the two upright goal-posts and above the cross-piece. If it does, the team is awarded 3 points and at the end all the points add up and the team with the most points is the winner. \nDuring play, the goal-kicker can also attempt a 'drop-goal'. The goal-kicker kicks towards the goal-posts. The ball must pass between the two upright goal-posts and above the cross-piece. If it does, the team is awarded 3 points. \nScrums.\nA scrum is when the two teams push together. If you are in the scrum you are a prop, hooker, flanker, second row, or 8-man.\nNumbers and Positions.\nForwards\n1 : Loose head prop\n2 : Hooker \n3 : Tight head prop\n4 : Lock / Second row\n5 : Lock / Second row\n6 : Blind side flanker / blind-side wing-forward\n7 : Open side flanker / open-side wing-forward\n8 : Number 8\nBacks\n9 : Scrum-half (or half-back)\n10 : Fly half/outside-half/outhalf (or first-five-eighth)\n11 : Left-wing\n12 : Inside centre (or second-five-eighth)\n13 : Outside centre\n14 : Right-wing\n15 : Fullback \nThe players in the back positions are usually smaller, faster and more skilful at kicking and passing. If you are a prop or a hooker you need to be heavy and strong as you play in the front row if there is a scrum. Flankers and locks are often tall and powerful and are used to win the ball in a lineout. \nRules.\nThe laws of Rugby Union whilst difficult at first are easy to pick up.\nThe key rule to rugby union play is that the person who is carrying the ball at any time cannot pass the ball to a teammate who is closer to the opposition goal line. The ball must always be passed sideways or backwards. \nOnly the player with the ball may be tackled. Tackling is when the player with the ball is brought to the ground by an opposition player. The opposition player must use their hands to hold onto the ball carrier, and take them to the ground. \nWhen the player with the ball is on the ground, players from the opposition team may stand over him and attempt to grab the ball off them. The opposition players must remain standing ('on their feet'). Meanwhile, the player with the ball will try to pass the ball backwards along the ground to a teammate. His teammates will then move over the player and protect the ball. \nDuring the game there are between one and four people who watch that the rules of the game are met. \nThe most important of these four is the referee who runs alongside players as they play the game. The referee controls the game. \nThe two touch-judges patrol the out-of-bounds areas. They also decide when a goal kick has been successful.\nThe TMO, or 'television match official', helps the referee with difficult decisions. Most professional games have a TMO.\nKicking.\nKicking is very important part of the rugby game. Normally, it is the back players who kick. However, you will sometimes see the forwards kick. There are different reasons why they may kick: to score points by making a drop goal, to place the ball further towards the other team's try line, or to gain distance by kicking the ball high into the air for a team mate to chase and catch.

Sir Richard was selected by the High Court of the Admiralty to set up the first English law court in the New World in 1615 in Trinity. He was kidnapped and held by the infamous Pirate Peter Easton in Harbour Grace. He also described a mermaid that he saw in St. John's harbour. Later, he became governor of Renews on the Southern Shore.\nWhitbourne, unlike most communities on the Island of Newfoundland is inland. It was founded in about 1880 during the construction of the Newfoundland Railway. The railway continued to be an important employer in the Town until its abandonment in 1988, although its economic importance weakened slowly throughout the twentieth century.\nSir Robert Bond, the Prime Minister from 1900 to 1909, played a role in the expansion and planning of the Town and developed a complex country home, the \"Grange\", there.\nThe town of Whitbourne is located just off the Trans-Canada Highway on Route 81.

Gounod (pronounce: \u201cGoo \u2013 no\u201d) wrote many different kinds of pieces, but he is best known today for his operas \"Faust\" and \"Rom\u00e9o et Juliette\" and, especially, for the very popular \u201cAve Maria\u201d which is a melody that goes with a prelude by Johann Sebastian Bach.\nEarly life.\nGounod was born in Paris. His father was a painter and engraver. His mother was his first piano teacher. When his father died in 1823 his mother started a school to teach the piano. Gounod soon showed musical talent and went to study at the Paris Conservatoire. He studied with three teachers, all of whom died soon after Gounod became their pupil. The first time he competed for the Prix de Rome he did not get it, but the third time, in 1839, he was successful. This meant that he could go to Rome to learn more about music.\nIn Rome he liked the religious music of the 16th century by composers such as Palestrina. He did not much like the modern opera composers such as Donizetti and Bellini. Gounod also spent some of the year in Austria and Germany. He passed through Leipzig where he met Mendelssohn, whose music made a big impression on him.\nGounod returned to Paris where he got a job as director of music at a church. He thought of becoming a priest, but then he changed his mind. He left his job in the church. Some time later he became friends with the singer Pauline Viardot and her husband Louis. He spent some time at their house composing the opera \"Sapho\".\nHe composed the \"Messe Sollennelle\", also known as the \"Saint Cecilia Mass\". Two fragments of this work were first performed in London during 1851 and it helped him to become famous. By this time he was married. He had a job in charge of several choirs. He started to write a lot of choral music.\nHe wrote two symphonies in 1855, the 1st Symphony in D major, and the 2nd Symphony in E flat, although they are not often played today.\nMiddle period.\nIn 1856 he started to write the opera by which he is now best remembered: \"Faust\" (1859), based on the first part of the play \"Faust\" by Goethe. The opera was produced in 1859 and soon was performed in many countries, especially in Germany. The composer Richard Wagner was the most important opera composer in Germany and his operas were quite different, so he said that Gounod\u2019s operas were silly.\nWhen the Franco-Prussian war broke out in 1870 Gounod went to live in England. He stayed there for five years becoming the first conductor of what is now the Royal Choral Society. Gounod wrote a lot of music for choirs at this time, including a motet composed especially for the grand opening of the Royal Albert Hall in 1871. He worked very hard, although he was often depressed about the war situation in France. His house in Saint-Cloud had been destroyed. He returned to France in 1874 and was glad to be back with his family.\nHe wrote much chamber music, including five string quartets, but these are hardly ever played today.\nLast years.\nLater in his life, Gounod became very interested in religion again. He wrote a lot of religious music, including his famous musical setting of Ave Maria based on the first prelude from Book I of \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" by J.S. Bach and \"Hymnus Pontificius\" the anthem of Vatican. He also wrote two oratorios, including \"Mors et vita\" which Queen Victoria liked so much that she asked for it to be played in the Royal Albert Hall in 1886.\nHe was just finishing a requiem called \"Le Grand Requiem\" when he died. He was given a state funeral on October 27, 1893. He asked for all the music at his funeral to be chant only."}

The version of rugby union is very popular, with notable comptitions including the IRB Sevens World Series and the Rugby World Cup Sevens. It is also played at events such as the Commonwealth Games and rugby league has also adopted the sevens format.\nRugby sevens was invented in Melrose, a small town in Scotland.\nIt is played under the same rules and on a field of the same dimensions as the 15-player game but a rugby sevens match lasts approximately 15 minutes (7 minutes aside with 1 minute half-time break) but the finals last somewhat more than 20 minutes; each half in a final is ten minutes instead of the normal seven minutes also the game ends when the ball goes of the pitch or points are scored. The point system is similar to rugby union where a Try gets a team 5 points and conversion 2 points with 3 points for penalties and Drop-goals (drop-goals are very uncommon in sevens). Points scoring occurs with much greater regularity in sevens compared to fifteens, since there are more spaces for players to run. Scrums still exist within sevens, composed of just three players from each team. Given the speedy nature of the game, players are usually either from the backline or the trio of loose forwards in fifteens rugby. All sevens players, wether in the forwards or otherwise must be fit,agile,relatively strong and demonstrate a high level of fitness in order to compete at an optimum level. Countries such as New Zealand, Fiji, South Africa, England, and Samoa have very successful sevens teams. Rugby sevens have also been played in the commonwealth games since 1998 where there are only boys teams. New Zealand is ranked as number 1 in the commonwealth games. New Zealand has won 4 gold medals and one silver medal."}

However, the IRB changed its mind, saying in 2013 that the World Cup would be kept. The next World Cup will be held in 2018, and from that point will continue every four years."}

He was born in Provence. He is famous as a 'seer' who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous around the world. His best known book was called \"Les Propheties\" (The Prophecies) and first appeared in 1555. Since its first publication the book has rarely been out of print. Over the years, many people have come to believe that Nostradamus predicted a range of events in history. People often reached this conclusion by applying methods similar to the Bible code - i.e. by twisting the texts in such a way as to suggest that they predicted the future. He died of edema in Provence.\nMost academics say that these associations between Nostradamus' quatrains and world events are the result of misinterpretations, or bad translations, that are so far-fetched that they are useless as a source of genuine prediction. What is more, no interpretation has yet managed to predict any event before it happened.\nFake Nostradamus prophecies.\nSome people have written prophecies that were wrongly assumed to be by Nostradamus. For example, in 1997 a college student in Canada wrote an essay that included a fake English quatrain (a four-line verse) written in the same style that Nostradamus used in French. The quatrain ended up on the Internet, where it was soon assumed that it was a verse by Nostradamus himself predicting the events of 9/11. So many people e-mailed it to their friends, thinking that it was by Nostradamus, that the associated websites and discussion forums were soon overwhelmed."}

Some tropical or subtropical areas, such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough. In the mid-latitude westerlies, troughs and ridges often exchange with each other, especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern. For a trough in the westerlies, the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast, divergent winds and low pressure. Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents, a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds."}

{"id": "70678", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70678", "title": "Shepherd", "text": "A shepherd is someone who looks after sheep. Shepherds usually take the sheep out into fields so that they can graze (eat the grass). In the same way, someone who looks after cows is called a \u201ccowherd\u201d. A \"swineherd\" looks after pigs and a \"goatherd\" looks after goats. A herd is a group of animals. \"Herding\" can also mean making a herd of animals go to another place. A female shepherd is called a \u201cshepherdess\u201d. \nMany years ago, when most people lived in the country, shepherding was very common. Sheep were kept for their milk, meat, and especially their wool. We know that there were shepherds in some parts of the world thousands of years ago.\nThe shepherd\u2019s job was to make sure the sheep were safe and they were not eaten by wolves or other wild animals.\nA shepherd\u2019s way of life.\nIn many societies shepherds were an important part of the economy. Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners. They were paid to watch other people\u2019s sheep. Shepherds often lived all on their own. Some were nomads. Shepherds were most often the younger sons of simple farmers who did not inherit any land. Still in other societies, each family would have a family member to shepherd its flock, often a child or young person or an old person who was not able to help much with the harder work. \nShepherds often worked with dogs. The dogs (sheepdogs) were trained to herd the sheep. Sheepdog trials are still popular today. The shepherd has to give signs to the dog to tell it exactly where he wants the sheep to go. \nA shepherd had a lot of time to sit and think or amuse himself. He often made simple instruments out of reeds that grew where he sat. These instruments were often simple pan flutes or just pipes which were similar to bamboo pipes or a modern recorder. Some shepherds learned to carve instruments out of wood. An example is the fujara from Slovakia and southern Poland.\nShepherds in the arts.\nShepherds often made up music. This is why composers of classical music very often wrote music which imitated the sound of the shepherd\u2019s pipe. For example: in Mozart\u2019s opera The Magic Flute the character Papageno, a birdcatcher, plays on his pipes. In the \"Symphonie Fantastique\" Berlioz wrote music which describes a shepherd playing his pipes, and a shepherdess far away the other side of the hill answering his call. Berlioz used an oboe and a cor anglais for this.\nMusicians were not the only people who liked the idea of the life of a shepherd. Many painters painted scenes in the country with sheep being looked after by a shepherd. Poets wrote about shepherds. The shepherd\u2019s way of life was thought to be the ideal way to live. It was called Arcadian. Poems like these are called pastoral, after the term for herding. Some early examples are the \"Idylls\" of Theocritus, and the \"Eclogues\" of Virgil."}

A failed attack in Geneva on October 3, 1980, in which two Armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group, the 3 October Organization. The ASALA's eight point manifesto was published in 1981.\nContinuous attacks prompted Turkey to accuse Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding the ASALA, though nothing of this sort was ever found to be true.\nAccording to Tessa Hofmann, Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with the ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups."}
