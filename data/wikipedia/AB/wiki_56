It is also used to write down the religious languages of Sanskrit and Pali. It is very different from the ABCs. It is known for having a lot of round letters that look like circles.\nSome people in Burma use the Burmese alphabet to write their own languages, but add extra letters to represent the sounds unique to their own languages.\nBurmese is written from left to right.\nHistory.\nMonks would write on palm leaves. They had to make the letters round because straight lines would split the leaf and ruin it. Eventually, these round letters became the Burmese alphabet as we know it today.\nLetters.\nThe Burmese alphabet has 33 basic consonants. Extra marks are added to indicate vowels and tones.\nConsonants.\nThere are 33 consonants in the Burmese alphabet. When they are alone, they have an \"ah\" sound, although people use the \"uh\" sound when another syllable follows it.\nThe Burmese alphabet is not organized the same way as the ABCs. Instead, consonants are organized by the parts of the mouth they are made in. For example, the first row of consonants are all sounds that are made when the tongue is against the back of the mouth.\nSome letters are written different in different cases to avoid confusion with other letters. For example, \u101d + \u102c is written as \u101d\u102b (wah) to avoid confusion with \u1010 (t).\nThere are letters that are used in words from Pali. They are: \u1003 (gh), \u1008 (jh), \u100b (\u1e6d), \u100c (\u1e6dh), \u100d (\u1e0d), \u100e (\u1e0dh), \u100f (\u1e47), \u1013 (dh), and \u1020 (\u1e37).\nTwo letters, \u1050 (\"\u015b\") and \u1051 (\"\u1e63\"), are only used in words that are from Sanskrit. They are pronounced the same as \u101e.\nTo make more consonants, special marks are written around or below consonants. These marks are: \u103b, \u103c, \u103d, and \u103e. They change the consonant sound. For example, \u101b makes a y sound (like you) but \u101b + \u103e makes \u101b\u103e which makes a sh sound (like shoe). There are rules about which consonants can be changed this way.\nVowels.\nEvery letter has a \"ah\" sound when it's alone. For example, \u1000 is pronounced as \"kah.\" When a lone letter is followed by another syllable, it is pronounced with a \"uh\" sound.\nSpecial marks are written around the letters to show other vowels.\nTones.\nBurmese is a tonal language. That means that the meaning of a word can change by how fast or slow someone let air out of their throats. In written Burmese, tones are indicated by special marks.\nThese marks are \u1038 (high tone) and \u1037 (creaky tone, but can only be used when an ending consonants is written down too).\nSyllable rhymes.\nBurmese words cannot end in a consonant sound. For example, \"cat\" would not be a word in Burmese because it has a \"t\" sound at the end. However, words are written with consonants to indicate special vowel sounds that are allowed at the end of Burmese words. These consonants have a special mark on them (\u103a) called asat. When these consonants are combined with the vowels that are already written, they are called syllable rhymes.\nSome of these special consonants indicate that the word needs to end with a puff of air, like in \"uh-oh\" between the uh and the oh. They are: \u1000\u103a, \u1005\u103a, \u1010\u103a, \u1015\u103a.\nOther special sounds indicate that the vowels is nasal. Nasal vowels are not found in English, but are found in other languages like French and Portuguese. They are: \u1004\u103a, \u100a\u103a \u1009\u103a, \u1014\u103a, \u1019\u103a.\nStacking consonants.\nIn Burmese writing, consonants can be written on top of each other. There are very specific rules on which consonants can be stacked on top of which.\n\u1041 is 1\n\u1042 is 2\n\u1043 is 3\n\u1044 is 4\n\u1045 is 5\n\u1046 is 6\n\u1047 is 7\n\u1048 is 8\n\u1049 is 9\n\u1041\u1040 is 10"}

Knuckle-walking animals curl fingers or front toes like a fist and touch the ground using the bony part of the front foot, the knuckle. Gorillas, chimpanzees, anteaters and platypuses knuckle-walk. In general, animals knuckle walk if their hands or front paws have special shapes for doing something very different from walking. Apes use their hands to hold food and use tools, so they have fingers. They curl up their fingers when they knuckle-walk. Anteaters use their front paws to dig for ants, so they curl up their digging claws when they knuckle-walk. Platypuses use their front paws to swim, so they curl up their webbed toes when they knuckle-walk.\nLarge anteaters that walk on the ground, for example the giant anteater, knuckle-walk. Smaller anteaters that live in trees do not. Platypuses walk on their knuckles so that the webbing on their front feet will not get in the way.\nGorillas from the genus \"Gorilla\" and chimpanzees from the genus \"Pan\" both walk on their knuckles but not in the same way. Chimpanzees spend more time in trees than gorillas do, so they turn their wrists in many different ways. Gorillas usually keep their wrists straight when they knuckle-walk. Gorillas and chimpanzees knuckle-walk when they move on the ground because their bodies are adapted to move around in trees: their arms are longer than their legs, and their middles are cone-shaped. The bones in their arms are good for knuckle-walking: the radius can lock into one of the bones in the wrist so the two bones together can hold the animal's weight. Human arm and wrist bones do not do this.\nSome fictional cavemen knuckle-walk or drag the knuckles of their long arms on the ground, but scientists do not agree on whether human beings evolved from ancestors who really knuckle-walked on the ground the way gorillas do. One team of scientists said humans evolved from a tree-living ancestor, like chimpanzees did, because of the way our wrist bones are. Another team of scientists wrote that \"Australopithecus anamensis\" and \"Australopithecus afarensis\", extinct relatives of humans, probably knuckle-walked."}

With the aim of preserving the biological diversity of endangered animals, plants and mammals.\nThe Environment.\nThe reserve contains a variety of living creatures from the animal and plant kingdoms despite the small size of the reserve and its presence in the middle of the Nile. Among the most famous animals in the reserve are camels, goats, wild donkeys, hyenas, and the red fox (the Egyptian fox) which, although it does not live mainly in the islands of the reserve but lives in the West Bank of the Nile and crosses the river by swimming to build a hole on the islands of the reserve. Sixty species of resident and migratory birds live in the reserve as well, some of which are threatened with extinction. The most famous of these rare birds is the black ibis, which became the symbol of the reserve. The plant life in the reserve is more varied and clear, as there are more than 90 different types of plants. The reserve is characterized by stunning landscapes that combine the often quiet vegetation with the water surface of the Nile, which made it an important tourist attraction.\nSaluga_and_ghazal.jpg"}

The phrase \"rest in power\" is used for people who have dedicated their lives to activism or those who have died due to oppression, such as racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Using the term \"rest in power\" instead of \"rest in peace\" sends a message that the dead person cannot rest in peace until change occurs. \"Rest in power\" also means that the dead person is making changes in society despite being dead.\nThe phrase \"rest in power\" is used in progressive groups.\nHistory.\n\"Rest in power\" is quite new. It first appeared in 2000 in honor of a graffiti artist in Oakland, California who was shot and killed. Later, it began to be used for people who were killed in shootings or murdered.\nBlack Lives Matter.\nPeople who are part of Black Lives Matter use \"Rest in power\" to remember all Black people who died because of racism. Even though the phrase wasn't used yet during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, people still say \"rest in power\" when talking about people who died because of racism back then or were involved in the movement. For example, Emmett Till died in 1955, but people still say \"rest in power\" when they're talking about him.\nWhen Trayvon Martin died, his parents used the phrase to honor him. They wrote a book called \"Rest in Power\" about his life.\nTransphobia.\nAn American trans girl named Leelah Alcorn killed herself in 2014 because she could not deal with her parents' transphobia. Even after she died, her parents still didn't treat her right and they called her by her deadname (name used before transitioning) instead of the name she wanted to be called. People used \"rest in power\" to honor Ms. Alcorn and recognize the fact that she wasn't treated right as a transgender person, even after she died.\nUsage.\nA person does not have to die due to violence in order for the term \"rest in power\" to be used. It can be used for people who were activists or those who struggled with systems of oppression in their lives. For example, Katherine Johnson was a NASA mathematician. She did not die a violent death. But US congresswoman Ilhan Omar used the phrase in a tweet to honor Johnson's achievements despite the racism and sexism she faced in NASA.\n\"Rest in power\" is not the same as \"rest in peace.\" This is because oppressed people cannot have peace until there is justice.\nAn example of what people think is a wrong use of \"rest in power\" is a tweet made by the Women's March organization after the death of Barbara Bush. A lot of people thought this was wrong because Bush was not a victim of oppression nor did she dedicate her life to fighting oppression."}

Using a person's deadname is considered to be very disrespectful because it ignores a person's gender identity and is a type of transphobia if it happens on purpose. Some people think that deadnaming is a form of violence.\nObstacles.\nIt is very hard for people to change their names on forms because there is a lot of paperwork involved. That means that they are more likely to experience deadnaming."}

On December 28, 2014, she killed herself because her parents did not respect her gender identity. They made her learn lessons at home and forced her to go to conversion therapy in order to force her to accept her birth gender. After Alcorn died, many laws were made in order to stop discrimination against trans people.\nLife.\nLeelah Alcorn was born into a conservative Christian family. They lived in the U.S. state of Ohio. \nIn the United States, many conservative Christians do not like anything related to LGBT causes. They believe that boys will always be boys and girls will always be girls because they think that God made them that way. They also think that transgender people are \"confused\" and need to learn how to appreciate their birth gender. One way they do that is through conversion therapy. However, many studies have shown that this type of therapy does not work and hurts the people it is supposed to help.\nEver since she was 4, Alcorn felt like a \"girl trapped in a boy's body.\" When she was 14, she identified as transgender. She told her mom that she was transgender. Her mom said that it was a \"phase\" and that she could never be a woman. This made her depressed, so her mom sent her to Christian therapists who also told her that she was a man and that she should \"look to God for help.\" When Alcorn was still alive, conversion therapy was still legal in Ohio. Going to these therapists did not make her feel better.\nWhen Alcorn was 16, she told other kids at school that she liked boys. Other kids at school accepted that she liked boys and were happy for her. However, her parents were not happy. They thought she was making look bad. They made her go to an online school that taught Christian values. They did not allow her to use social media or a cell phone. Because of these rules, Alcorn felt very alone.\nDeath.\nBefore she died, Alcorn wrote a post on Tumblr. It said:\nAlcorn asked for her belongings to be sold so that the money could go to support groups that work for trans rights. She signed the note as \"(Leelah) Alcorn.\" \"Josh\" was the name her parents gave her at birth.\nShe also wrote another note and left it in her bedroom. It said, \"I've had enough.\" Her parents threw it away after the police made a copy.\nAlcorn walked onto a highway near her house and was hit by a truck.\nThe note got a lot of attention on Tumblr. However, her Tumblr blog disappeared after her parents asked Tumblr to delete it.\nAlcorn's family had a private funeral. Her body was said to have been cremated.\nIn 2015, the Ohio State Patrol said that Alcorn's death was a suicide.\nReactions.\nMany people were sad that Leelah Alcorn died and that she was treated badly by her parents. They thought that she was a victim of her parent's transphobia.\nLeelah's parents.\nAlcorn's parents were sad that she died. However, they refused to recognize her as transgender. In a Facebook post, Alcorn's mother Carla called her by her deadname, A lot of people thought that was disrespectful because \"Josh\" was not the name Alcorn wanted to be called. Some people sent mean messages to her mom on Facebook. Others said that her parents should go to jail and lose custody of their other kids. Carla Alcorn deleted the post.\nCarla Alcorn went onto CNN and said that \"we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy.\" Some people said that their love was not \"unconditional\" because of their hostile reaction to Leelah when she told them she was trans.\nOthers.\nMany people around the world talked about Alcorn's death. They made art and lit candles to honor her.\nMany LGBT rights groups said that transgender suicide happened a lot because trans people are being treated badly, just like how Leelah was treated wrong. Besides the problem of suicide, trans people are often killed and treated wrong in other ways.\nSome people tried to raise money to buy a gravestone with the name Leelah Alcorn on it to replace the gravestone with her birth name on it. However, this did not happen. Instead, a group bought a bench, tree, and plaque.\nLeelah's Law.\nA petition was made to ban conversion therapy in the United States. President Barack Obama said that he supported laws banning conversion therapy. \nIn December of 2015, Cincinnati banned conversion therapy. As of July 2020, five cities in Ohio have banned conversion therapy and two others had banned it on minors."}

It is said that in order to become one you must kill a close friend or a family member.\nDescription.\nThe concept of the skin-walker is unique to the Navajo people. In their language, the word \"yee naaldlooshii\" means, \"with it [the animal skin], he goes on all fours.\"\nA skin-walker may be a man or a woman. Skin-walkers are usually associated with trickster animals like the coyote or with animals that represent death and bad luck. They can turn into any animal they want by wearing its skin. Because of this, the Navajo will not wear the skin of a predator animal. Also, skin-walkers are really fast. People can be possessed by a skin-walker by looking them in the eye.\nA skin-walker knows about the same rituals and spells like other Navajo medicine men. Unlike medicine men, they use their knowledge to do evil. A person becomes a skin-walker by killing someone in their family, which is a really evil thing to do according to the Navajo.\nThe Navajo agree that skin-walkers are hard to kill. According to them, the best way to kill a skin-walker is to get a shaman who knows about good magic to do certain spells and rituals that can return a skin-walker's evil back to them. Others think that skin-walkers can be killed by bullets dipped in white ash. However, these bullets won't work unless they hit the skin-walker in the head or neck.\nThe skin-walker represents everything evil in the Navajo culture. To them, there is nothing good about the skin-walker. People who are skin-walkers use black magic to kill others.\nThey really do not like talking about skin-walkers, especially to people who are not Navajo. Some even do not want to say the word and will take great pains to hide it, such as by typing sk*nw*lker. They believe that saying its name or mentioning it will make it appear.\nStories.\nThe Navajo tell stories about the skin-walker in order to teach their children about right and wrong. They believe that children who learn how to do the right thing and lead moral lives are less likely to become evil, which is what the skin-walker is.\nWhen non-Native people talk about the skin-walker, they usually use it in horror movies and stories. But when Native people tell horror stories, they use another scary character to replace the skin-walker."}

All five banks are operationally based in Toronto. All five banks are classified as Schedule I banks that are domestic banks operating in Canada under government charter. The banks' shares are widely held, with any entity allowed to hold a maximum of twenty percent.\nThe Big Five are among the world's strongest banks, with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal &amp; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 11th, 15th, 21st, 28th &amp; 29th place, respectively.\nIn modern history, Royal Bank has always been the largest by a significant margin, although TD Bank has overtaken RBC in recent years. Up to the late 1990s, CIBC was the second largest, followed by Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, and TD Bank. During the late 1990s and beyond, this ranking changed due to several reorganizations. Royal Bank acquired Royal Trust in 1993, while Scotiabank purchased National Trust in 1997. As Scotiabank found no merger partners among the other banks in the big five group, it instead expanded its international operations and passed the Bank of Montreal in size. TD Bank merged with Canada Trust, which was for a long time the largest trust in Canada, thus vaulting TD into the number one spot. There has been no major changes to Bank of Montreal. CIBC's first unsuccessful foray into the US market led it to shed its assets there, dropping it to the number five spot."}

It covered the big four banks (Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB, ANZ) and two insurers (AMP and National Mutual). It was essentially designed to block the merger between ANZ and National Mutual at the time. Keating believed this arrangement would ensure a competitive banking market.\nIn 1997, leading business figure Stan Wallis (Businessweek bio) produced a report of his inquiry into Australia's financial system (the Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry, commonly referred to as \"the Wallis report.\") which recommended that the \"Four Pillars\" model be dismantled, to leave the banks subject to the same merger competition tests as other businesses. In response, then Coalition Treasurer Peter Costello's removed the pillar status of the two insurers (National Mutual had by that time already been acquired by France's AXA), but the ban on mergers of the remaining four banks was retained, with the rider that none of them were considered immune from foreign takeover. With the change of government, new Treasurer Wayne Swan has stated in 2008, that the Labor government has no plans to dismantle the four pillars policy.\nThe four pillars policy does not prevent the four major banks from acquiring smaller competitors. For example, in 2000, CBA acquired the Colonial group, which had emerged as a major bank\u2013insurance combine in the 1990s, after the Colonial Mutual insurance group took over State Bank of NSW in 1994. The Commonwealth Bank also acquired the State Bank of Victoria in 1990 and BankWest in 2008. Westpac acquired the Challenge Bank in 1995, the Bank of Melbourne in 1997, and St.George Bank in 2008.\nCriticism.\nThe policy has been criticised for being anti-competitive by ensuring that the four major banks are immune from takeover by the most likely suitors. At the same time, it is credited with insulating the banks from the global financial crisis of 2007\u201308. The major banks have criticised the policy on the basis that limiting the size of Australian banks makes them less internationally competitive."}

Scientists think this helps the frog harder to see so it can hide from larger animals that want to eat it. Scientists tell \"Nyctimystes\" frogs apart from \"Litoria\" frogs because \"Nyctimystes\" frogs have vertical (up and down) pupils in their eyes and \"Litoria\" frogs have horizontal (side to side) pupils in their eyes.\nThese frogs live in tropical or subtropical rainforests on mountains.

It is located in the Salford suburb of Broughton, Greater Manchester, England. It is about 1.5 miles from Manchester city centre. It plays in the Women's Super League (WSL). This is the highest level of English women's football. United were promoted from the Championship at the end of the 2018\u201319 season. They train at Leigh Sports Village. However, the team will move to The Cliff when redevelopment work is done.\nHistory.\n1970s\u20132001: Unofficial team.\nA team called Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies started playing in the late 1970s. It was unofficially known as the club's first women's team. They helped start the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989. The team played better and better in the 90s at different levels of the FA Women's National League, until 2001.\n2001\u20132005: Partnership and disbandment.\nIn 2001, the team started an official partnership with Manchester United. However, the club finished mid-table in the third division for a few years. The team stopped playing four years later, in 2005. This was soon after Malcolm Glazer's bought the club. He did not believe the women's team was going to make him any money. A media spokesman for Manchester United also said that the club wanted to focus on its women's academy instead of its senior team.\n2018\u2013present: Current team.\nIn March 2018, Manchester United announced they wanted to start a new women's football team. Manchester United Women Football Club started again on 28 May 2018. This was after the team asked to join the new 2018\u201319 FA Women's Championship. This was thirteen years after the club stopped playing in 2005. The club's academy had continued through the Manchester United Foundation. For example, Izzy Christiansen and Katie Zelem went through United's Centre of Excellence academy. Casey Stoney was the club's first head coach. She became coach on 8 June. They announced the first 21-player team about a month later.\nThe team's first game back was on 19 August 2018. They won 1\u20130 in an away game against Liverpool in the FA Women's League Cup. Lizzie Arnot scored their first competitive goal in thirteen years. Three weeks later, they played their first Championship match. They won 12\u20130 against Aston Villa. On 17 April 2019, United won promotion to the FA Women's Super League after a 5\u20130 win against the same team. They won the FA Women's Championship title three days later. This was after a 7\u20130 win at home to Crystal Palace. In May 2019, Manchester United were named FA Women's Championship Club of the Year at the 2019 FA Women\u2019s Football Awards.\nThe 2019\u201320 season was the team's first FA WSL campaign. The season's first game was a Manchester derby. It was at the City of Manchester stadium. Manchester City won the match 1\u20130 in front of a league record attendance of 31,213. United's first division campaign ended early because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team ended in fourth place on a points per game basis. They won their last game 3\u20132 against Everton on 23 February 2020. Leah Galton scored twice and Ella Toone scoring once for Manchester United. This was the first game at Everton's new Walton Hall Park stadium. In the FA Cup, Manchester United lost 3\u20132 to Manchester City in the fourth round. This was the first time they had lost in the first knockout round of a competition. However, they got to the semi-finals in the League Cup for the second time. They lost 1\u20130 to Chelsea. Chelsea also won in the final.\nGround.\nWhen the club joined in the 2018\u201319 FA Women's Championship, they announced they would be located in Broughton, Salford at The Cliff training ground, when it was ready. Until then, United will play their games at Leigh Sports Village. Moss Lane is the venue when the Sports Village is not available. The club also sometimes play at Ewen Fields. United played an FA Cup fifth round match there against London Bees in February 2019.\nReserves and academy.\nManchester United had a girls academy up to under 16's level even when the senior team did not play between 2005 and 2018. This was because of FA rules. The club's partner charity is The Manchester United Foundation. Its work includes coaching girls at all ages across Greater Manchester. Before the 2019\u201320 season, Manchester United started a full-time U21 team. It played in the FA WSL Academy League for the first time. Charlotte Healy is the manager. The club's development team had played the WSL Academy Cup final against Arsenal the season before. They lost 5-0.\nAcademy graduates.\nThe academy players below have also played in the senior team.

{"id": "774095", "revid": "656019", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=774095", "title": "School discipline", "text": "When a student or group of students show behaviour that disrupts the current activity, or that goes against rules of the school, a teacher or the school can take action. This action is usually called school discipline. Discipline can guide the children's behaviour or set limits to help them learn to take better care of themselves, other people and the world around them.\nEvery school has a set of rules and if students break these rules they are subject to discipline. For example, these rules may say that pupils (students) need to wear a school uniform, and what the school uniform must look like. They usually also say that school starts at a given time, and that pupils must be present at the school, at that time. If pupils do not follow the rules, they will be punished. The term \"discipline\" is applied to the punishment that is the consequence of breaking the rules. The aim of discipline is to set limits restricting certain behaviors or attitudes that are seen as harmful or against the school policies, educational norms, school traditions, etc. In the early days of schools, it was common to punish people if they did not follow the rules set by the school. In more recent times, other approaches have also been tried, such as rewarding good behavior. \nThe importance of discipline.\nIt is important to create an environment, where it is safe and fun for children to learn. Many people confuse discipline with classroom management; discipline is one dimension of classroom management and classroom management is a general term. Discipline can also have a positive effect on both the individual as well as classroom environment. The right form of punishment can give the pupil a chance to reflect and learn about consequences. It can also give collective values, and encourage behavior that is acceptable for the classroom. Recognition of the diversity of values within communities can increase understanding and tolerance of different disciplinary techniques.\nCorporal punishment.\nCoproal punishment was the most common means of maintaining discipline. When a child was at school, the teacher acted as a substitue parent. Many forms of punishment and rewards were open to the teacher. Hitting children with a cane or a stick was a common punishment if the child did something wrong. \nCorporal punishment in schools has now disappeared from most Western countries, including all European countries. In the United States, corporal punishment is not used in public schools in 34 states, banned in 31, permitted in 19, of which only 16 actually have school districts actively administering corporal punishment. Every U.S. state except New Jersey and Iowa permits corporal punishment in private schools. Many private schools have abandoned the practice, though, especially Catholic schools, nearly all of which now ban. Thirty-one U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia have banned it from public schools, most recently New Mexico in 2011. The other 19 states (mostly in the South) still allow corporal punishment in public schools. Of the 19 which permit the practice, three \u2013 Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming have no public schools that actually use corporal punishment as of 2016. Paddling is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it, though many choose not to do so.\nOfficial corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.\nMost mainstream schools in most other countries still have punishment for misbehavior, but it usually takes non-corporal forms such as detention and suspension.\nIn China, school corporal punishment was completely banned under the Article 29 of the Compulsory Education Act of the People's Republic of China, but in practice, beating by schoolteachers is still common, especially in rural areas.\nIn Australia, school corporal punishment has been banned in public schools in all states, but as of 2019, it is still permitted in private schools in Queensland and the Northern Territory.\nOther forms of discipline.\nDetention.\nDetention is one of the most common punishments in schools. A pupil needs to report to a designated area of the school, at a specified time. The pupil will then have to stay at that area, for a given time.\nFailure to attend detention without a valid excuse can sometimes result in another longer detention, or a more severe punishment\nCounseling.\nCounseling is also provided when students will have to see a school counselor (guidance counselor) for misbehavior. The purpose of counseling is to help the student recognize their mistakes and find ways to avoid them. Counseling can also help the student clarify the school's expectations, as well as understand the consequences of failing to meet those standards.\nSuspension.\nSuspension means that a student must not attend classes, for a given time. In some cases, the student must still come to school, but will not see classmates or teachers during that day. Students who have been suspended are also not allowed to attend out-of-school events (such as sporting events, or proms). \nUsually, schools are required to tell the student's parents why the student was suspended. \nSuspension usually means that students still need to do homework, assignments and exams.\nExpulsion.\nExpulsion is the most severe form of punishment. It terminates the student's education at the given school. This is the last resort, when all other methods of discipline have failed. However, in extreme situations, it may also be used for a single offense, such as setting fires on campus, the activation of false alarms,or assault and battery against faculty and staff members,or school administrators. In some cases, there are special schools for the pupuls that have been excluded from other schools. \nUsually, the parents can appeal against the decision to expel a student."}

It is common on the Canary Islands, and on the coasts of South America. It is often called Miel de palma, which translates to palm honey.\nUses.\nMiel de palma is used to accompany many pastries and desserts, such as pancakes and ice cream. The syrup is widely used in Southeast Asian cooking, in particular in West Bengal, where jhola gur, as it is known, is only obtainable in winter. Its sweetness tempers the flavours of spicy curries, adding its rich, molasses-like flavour to the food. It is also widely used as an ingredient in desserts, or drizzled over prepared foods.\nPalm sap is a refreshing drink, and fermented palm syrup is distilled to produce various alcohols such as arrack, a spirit similar to rum. On La Gomera it is mixed with 'Parra' (similar to grappa) to produce Gomeron.\nPalm syrup is also traditionally used on La Gomera for general medicinal purposes."}

{"id": "774161", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=774161", "title": "Canadian Indian residential school system", "text": "Until 1996, Indigenous children in Canada were forced to go to boarding schools in order to make them assimilate into white Canadian society. The Indian residential school system refers to the group of these schools for First Nations children. These schools were run by Christian churches and got money from the Canadian government. These schools existed for over 100 years and more than 150,000 children were in them. Of these children, at least 3,200 died.\nMany residential schools were started when the Indian Act was passed in 1876. In 1896, a change was made to the Act so that all First Nations children had to go to school. A lot of their communities were located far away from schools, so they had to go to residential schools and live there for the school year. These schools were usually very far away from their families in order to encourage them to assimilate. There were residential schools in every province and territory except for New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\nAt these schools, these children were forced to give up their cultures. They were given new names and were not allowed to speak their mother tongues or visit their families. They were abused at these schools and were not treated well. When these children graduated from these schools, they did not fit into their Indigenous communities or into mainstream Canadian society. They did not learn the skills needed to survive off the land. At the same time, these schools did not teach them how to skills on how to live in cities or stop the students from becoming victims of racism. Studies have shown that these students and their children and grandchildren are more likely to have problems such as PTSD, alcoholism, drug use, and suicide than kids who did not go to residential schools.\nIn 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the survivors of the residential schools on behalf of the Canadian government. The government also set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in order to learn the truth about what happened at these schools. Many survivors came and talked about their experiences. In 2015, the TRC published a report that said the residential school system was cultural genocide.\nHistory.\nEver since Europeans arrived in North America, they have been trying to teach the native peoples there about European ways. The discovery doctrine that Europeans believed said that it was OK to colonize the land because the people they found were not Christian and were \"uncivilized.\" They thought it was their duty to teach others about Christianity and civilization.\nFrench missionaries started schools for Indigenous people in the 17th century. However, they stopped because making Indigenous people unhappy was not good for the fur trade.\nIn the 1820s, English missionaries started schools in what is now Manitoba and Ontario. Unlike the French schools, they taught Protestantism.\nThe Canadian government became interested in starting schools for Indigenous people because they were no longer allies in war. Instead, they were seen as nuisances because many of them moved around as nomads and didn't practice agriculture. The Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) partnered up with the churches to start putting more Indigenous children into the residential schools and \"kill the Indian in the child\" by converting them to Christianity and bringing them into European-Canadian society. The government provided the buildings and money while the church provided the teachers and staff.\nOf the schools run by churches, most of them were run by the Catholic Church. Other schools were run by the Anglican Church, the United Church of Canada, and the Presbyterian Church.\nLife in Residential Schools.\nThe students at the schools were treated bad by the teachers and staff. They were beaten up and sexually abused. The teachers believed that beating up the students helped to save their souls and stop them from running away. It was bad for a school if students ran away because they were responsible if a student died while running away. Students were malnourished. The schools were crowded, dirty, cold, and didn't have good medical care. That meant that a lot of students ended up getting tuberculosis.\nTeaching style.\nIn the residential schools, students learned the same way that European kids were taught. This was very different from how First Nations people taught their kids. The Indigenous people used a \"look, listen, learn\" method of education that did not involve classrooms or books. Instead, they taught their kids through games, stories, and ceremonies. The kids struggled with book-learning because that was not how their parents taught them. They were also forced to speak English and French. Sometimes, they were beaten up if they spoke in their native languages.\nResistance.\nThe residential schools didn't meet their goal in extinguishing Indigenous cultures. In some cases, students burned down the schools.\nDeaths.\nA lot of students died at the schools from disease.\nSchool closings.\nMany Indigenous communities began to take over the schools. They thought that the schools were not doing a good job in teaching their kids.\nSome schools became normal day schools, and some schools were burned down or torn down by former students. And still others are now abandoned.\nEffects.\nThe residential school survivors lost a lot of their culture. They felt powerless. To cope with their feelings, they hurt themselves and others around them.\nMany of the survivors now have mental health problems because of their experiences at the schools.\nApologies.\nIn 1986, the United Church of Canada said sorry for its part in colonization. In 1996, it apologized for running residential schools.\nIn 1993, the Anglican Church apologized. The next year, the Presbyterian Church apologized too.\nIn 2004, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) apologized for forcing children into the schools.\nFederal government.\nIn 2009, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the survivors of the residential schools. His apology was broadcast nationwide.\nVatican expression of sorrow.\nIn 2009, the Vatican made a statement that expressed sorrow at how the Church was involved in oppressing Indigenous Canadians. In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked Pope Francis for an apology to the survivors instead of just an expression of sorrow."}

It includes foreign resistance movements and guerilla groups, who fight against an occupying force or their own government. \nIn conventional warfare, the fighters usually wear uniforms, which identifies them as fighters in an army, under the laws of war. With unconventional warfare, this is not the case. Those engaging in unconventional warfare need to hide before they can launch an attack. This means that in most cases they do not wear specific uniforms which identify them as fighters. Struggles of this type are going on at present in parts of Africa.\nAn unconventional war is rarely announced as a war. No declaration of war is made. Usually, the only feature which is noticed is the presence in a country of organised fighters. The fighters come from a neighbouring country or from parts of the existing country. There are no set rules. \nThis kind of warfare has been quite common since 1900. Terrorism is the intimidation of the native civilian population by armed fighters or insurgents, often known as \"guerrillas\". Warfare inside a state by citizens who wish to overthrow the state, also generally called terrorism by the government, has also been common.\nStruggle between regular forces (armies in uniforms) may happen without a formal declaration of war. Red versus white after the end of royal rule in Russia (Russian Civil War) is a good example. It was a semi-formal war, fought with regular troops on both sides. So was the seizing of Manchuria (Manchukuo) by Japan in the early 1930s. Regular Japanese army forces were used.\nAfter World War I and World War II unconventional forces were used to drive out colonial powers or to try and do so. The struggle against colonialism was usually by irregular forces supported by weapons and men from powers interested in removing the colonies (usually Russia or China).\nThe dividing line between conventional and unconventional warfare is not clear-cut. In general conventional war is fought between regular armies, navies, air forces. Unconventional warfare is usually fought on the ground with at least one side not in uniform, usually against forces of the established government. It is an attempt to overthrow a government or to replace in it some part of the country.\nUSA definition.\nThe USA Department of Defense defines unconventional warfare as activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force in a denied area. Also called UW."}

Northern Mali is hot desert and is in the southern part of the Sahara. The third side is Islamist groups - including Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda - who want Mali to be part of an Islamist caliphate.\nThe United Nations has reported many human rights violations, both by the forces close to the government, and by the different rebel groups. Allegedly, there have been amputations, floggings, and extrajudicial executions. A couple was stoned in 2012, for allegedly having an extramarital affair. Based on these reports, the International Criminal Court started investigations into war crimes and human rights abuses. According to the BBC, about 250,000 people have left because of the fighting. They are now refugees and internally displaced people. Another problem is that World Heritage Sites are threatened by the war. There are mosques built of mud, in Timbuktu, which are threatened. In September 2021, a contract was signed between the Malian state and a private Russian military company linked to the Russian military group Wagner. The document provides for the deployment of mercenaries in the country, in liaison with the Malian army, and the protection of senior figures."}

They want to start a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and Acholi tradition.\nThe conflict is one of the longest in Africa. It has started a humanitarian crisis. The International Criminal Court says that the LRA has violated human rights. This includes mutilation, torture, slavery, rape, the abduction (kidnapping) of civilians, the use of child soldiers, and a number of massacres. By 2004, the LRA had abducted more than 20,000 children. 1.5 million civilians had to move. The LRA killed about 100,000 civilians.\nBackground.\nIn January 1986, the National Resistance Army (NRA) of south-west Uganda born Yoweri Museveni overthrew President Tito Okello, an ethnic Acholi. This started a period of unrest. When they tried to liberate the whole country, the NRA were responsible of many atrocities on the people of Acholi. This made some Acholis want to fight against these acts. Reports sometimes say that the Acholi were afraid to lose their traditional (usual) control of the national military. They were also very worried that the NRA would want retribution for the violent counterinsurgency, especially the actions of the army in the Luwero triangle. By August 1986, a complete popular insurgency had started in northern regions that the new government soldiers occupied."}

{"id": "774376", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=774376", "title": "Missing and murdered Indigenous women", "text": "Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) is a big problem in the United States and Canada. In both countries, Indigenous women and girls are more likely to go missing or be murdered than non-Indigenous women and girls.\nThe problem of MMIW reflects the intersectionality of racism and sexism Indigenous women in the US and Canada face. It also shows how the governments are not doing enough to help women.\nBackground.\nBefore colonialism, Indigenous cultures in North America treated women with respect because they were seen as givers of life. The women folk helped make important decisions in their communities.\nEuropean colonists in Canada and the US did not treat Indigenous women right. They called them names like \"squaw\" and thought they were immoral. European men used them for sex. Sometimes they killed the women folk. Back then, people could get away with treating Indigenous women badly because very few people at the time cared about Indigenous women like they cared about white women. To this very day, people in both countries have negative ideas about Indigenous women. Because they have those ideas, they do not treat them right.\nNative Americans and Aboriginal Canadians had their cultures taken away from them. They were forced to adopt the white man's ways. The men folk learned from the white men on how to disrespect women. Also, a lot of the Indigenous people were forced to go to schools where they were treated badly. A lot of men vented out their feelings by hurting the women folk.\nIndigenous communities tend to be the poorest in the US and Canada. Because of this, a lot of Indigenous women go into sex trafficking in order to make money. This allows them to be hurt by their pimps, customers, and the police. Also, few people will speak up on their behalf because there is a stigma around working in the sex industry.\nCanada.\nIndigenous women make up 4% of the female population in Canada. Yet they represented 16% of all female homicide victims between 1980 and 2012.\nThe RCMP does not release data on the ethnicity of the perpetrators.\nHighway of Tears.\nHighway 16 is in British Columbia. There is a part of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert that is 700km long. It is known for being a place where a lot of Indigenous women have gone missing or have been found dead. A lot of people think there is a serial killer/s on the highway targeting young women.\nHitchhiking is a popular practice in this part of Canada because most people cannot afford cars and there is no good public transportation system. This puts a lot of women in danger because they might meet a driver who will do bad things to them.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, 1 in 3 Native women is assaulted during her lifetime. 67% of these assaults are done by non-Natives. Tribes have difficulty prosecuting non-Natives who hurt Natives on tribal land because their land is considered federal land. Because of this, there is a lot of confusion as whether the federal government, the state government, or the tribes should press criminal charges against non-Native perpetrators.\nProtest.\nThere have been many protests to ask for more investigations into why there are so many missing and murdered Indigenous women. People are also doing things to help find missing women because they do not believe the government will help them.\nWomen's Memorial March.\nEvery Valentine's Day, a march is held in Downtown Eastside, Vancouver, which is an area with a lot of missing and murdered Indigenous women. The first march was in 1991 and was held to honor a murdered Coast Salish woman.\nDrag the Red.\nIn 2014, Tina Fontaine was found dead in the Red River in Manitoba. Since then, people have searched the rivers and ponds of Winnipeg to find bodies. Hiding bodies in water is popular with perpetrators because evidence is washed off.\nArt.\nA lot of art has been made to honor missing and murdered Indigenous women.\nREDress Project.\nThe REDress Project is an art project that is made up of red dresses. Each dress represents a missing or murdered Indigenous woman. These dresses are displayed for people to see."}

According to the editor of the \"Navajo Times\" Tom Aviso, \"squaw\" is the worst word used on Native American women.\nOrigin.\nThe word \"squaw\" comes from the Algonquian languages, where it means \"woman.\" In the Massachusset language, the word is \"squ\u00e0w.\" In Cree, it is \"iskwew.\"\nSome people say that the word \"squaw\" comes from a Mohawk word that means vagina. However, many linguists, for example Ives Goddard of the Smithsonian, thinks this is not so and \"squaw\" came from the regular Massachusetts word \"squa,\" for \"woman.\"\nCurrent use.\nSquaw is considered an offensive word because many non-Natives have used it to disrespect Native American and Aboriginal Canadian women.\nSome people in Indigenous communities think \"squaw\" is offensive. According to members of the Nooksack Tribal Council, Native Americans in general see \"squaw\" as an insulting word. Other Native Americans think the word should be \"reclaimed\", meaning made a normal word again.\nThe root of \"squaw\" is in some compound words in Algonquin languages that are spoken today: \"nidobaskwa\" means \"female friend,\" \"manigebeskwa\" means \"woman of the woods,\" and \"Squaw Sachem\" means \"female chief.\"\nHistorical use.\nEuropean colonizers used the word to talk about Indigenous women.\nWhen white colonists moved west, they used words like \"squaw\" even when they were talking about women whose tribes spoke languages different from Algonquian. It became a generic word.\nStereotype.\nEuropean men in the US and Canada were not respectful of Indigenous women. They used them for sex. When they called the women \"squaw,\" they used it in a way that showed that they saw those women as sex objects and not human beings. Over time, the word \"squaw\" came to mean a woman who was dirty, sexually abused, violent, fit only for mindless work or some group of these.\nAccording to scholars, for example D. Francis and D. Merskin, the squaw is the second most common stereotype of Native American women. The most common is the Indian princess. The two stereotypes work as a pair. The princess was imagined as beautiful and sexually well-behaved. The squaw was imagined as ugly, dirty and sexually available.\nScholars say white people stuck to the idea of the squaw so they could say American Indian culture was bad. They pretended the cultures were full of lazy men who forced women to do all the real work. That way, they could make it sound like wiping out the culture of Native Americans was a good thing.\nName changes.\nPeople in the US and Canada are trying to change place names with the word \"squaw\" in it because they feel it is not respectful to Indigenous women. However, there are still many places where the word is in the name."}

{"id": "774739", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=774739", "title": "English football league system", "text": "The English football league system is a series of leagues that are connected for men's association football clubs in England. Five teams also come from Wales, one team comes from Guernsey and one comes from Jersey. It is also called the football pyramid. The system has a hierarchical format. It has promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels. This means that in theory, even the smallest club can get to the top of the system. In the system, there are more than 140 leagues, and more than 480 divisions.\nThe total number of clubs changes every year. This is because clubs join and stop playing in leagues. Sometimes it is also because a club stops existing or merges with another club. An average of 15 clubs per division means that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are in a league in the English men's football league system.\nThere are no official definitions of any level below 11. This means that the structure at level 12 and below is not definitive.\nThe pyramid for women's football in England is not the same. It has nine levels. Also, some English men's football clubs play outside the English football league system.\nHistory.\nAston Villa director William McGregor created the (English) Football League in 1888. The biggest clubs were the ones who were in support of professionalism. The twelve first clubs were six from Lancashire (Accrington, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Everton and Preston North End) and six from the Midlands (Aston Villa, Derby County, Notts County, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers).\nAbout the system.\nThe system is a pyramid of leagues. These are part of the same system through the idea of promotion and relegation. The better clubs in each league go to a higher league. The clubs that finish the season at the bottom of their league can go down to a lower league. Promotion has two important factors. The first factor is how well the club plays. The second factor is that the club needs to meet criteria set by the higher league. These criteria are often about having the right facilities and finances.\nIn theory, it is possible for a low level local amateur club to win promotions. Within a few years they can get to the highest level of the English game and become champions of the Premier League. In practice, this is not likely (at least not in a short period of time). However, clubs move a lot within the pyramid.\nThe top five levels each have one division. They are national leagues. This means clubs in these leagues play in the whole country. In level 6 and lower, the levels have more and more leagues at the same level. The lower levels are in a smaller location. Many leagues have more than one division. At the lower levels the leagues do not always exist. In some places where a lot of people live, there are leagues more than twenty levels below the Premier League. There are also leagues in different parts of the country which are not officially part of the system. This is because they do not have formal agreements with other leagues. However some county football associations accept these leagues exist. Clubs from these leagues can join a league in the system. They usually need to have the right standard of play (they need to play football well enough) and have right facilities.\nThe seven levels just below the Premier League and English Football League are called the National League System. The Football Association (FA) is the authority for these leagues. The system has changed over many years. The biggest change recently was when there were two new leagues at level six. These were the Conference North and Conference South (now National League North and South). This meant that the top divisions of the Southern League, Isthmian League and Northern Premier League went down to level seven. In May 2014 The FA announced provisional plans for a new division between the English Football League and the National League. This would include \"B\" teams (second teams) of higher-level clubs (for example, Manchester City F.C. B Team, or Liverpool F.C. B Team) . However, they changed this idea later. This meant that Premier League \"B\" teams could not play in the new division. Soon after this, they gave up the idea.\nThe English football league system does not include the amateur version of the game often called Sunday league football. These leagues are independent. They do not have promotion or relegation. They do not belong to the football pyramid. However, some Sunday league clubs sometimes join pyramid leagues. This is often if they want to play at a higher level. There are also some Saturday leagues which are not officially part of the pyramid. However, teams often leave these for pyramid leagues. The FA accepted a non-promoting Saturday league (a league with no promotion or relegation) to the pyramid in May 2017. This was the Lincolnshire League.\nStructure.\nAt the top is the single division of the Premier League (Level 1). This is often called the \"top-flight\". It has 20 clubs. They were all located in England until the 2010\u201311 season. However, two Welsh teams (Swansea City and Cardiff City) have since played in the league. Below the Premier League is the English Football League (EFL). This used to be the Football League. It has three divisions of 24 clubs each: The Championship (Level 2), League One (Level 3) and League Two (Level 4). The 20 clubs in the Premier League and the 72 clubs in the English Football League are all full-time (all the time) professional clubs. The Premier League teams are still often called 'League' clubs. This is because before 1992 the Football League, as it was called then, included all 92 clubs in four divisions. In 1992, the Premier League started, and became separate. Clubs outside this group of 92 teams are called 'non-League' clubs (i.e. non-EFL). However, they also play their football in league competitions.\nThe top level of non-League football is the National League. It has a national division (National League) of 24 clubs (Level 5). It is the lowest level with a single league for the whole country. This division is like the four above. It is a full-time professional competition. However, some promoted clubs keep their part-time status. There are two divisions at Level 6. They cover the north (National League North) and the south (National League South). They have 22 clubs each. Some of these clubs are full-time professional clubs. The other clubs are semi-professional. Below the National League, some of the stronger clubs are also semi-professional. However, in the lower levels, soon all the clubs are amateur. Lower-level leagues are also often for smaller regions. This is because smaller clubs don't have as much money to travel far away.\nBelow the National League, there are three regional leagues. Each is in a different area. Sometimes the areas are similar. They are the Northern Premier League (which covers the north of England), Southern Football League (which covers the Midlands, south and southwest of England, with one club from South Wales) and the Isthmian League (which includes clubs from the south-east of England as well as Guernsey from the Channel Islands). All of the leagues have Premier Divisions of 22 teams (Level 7). Below these, the Northern Premier League and Southern Football League each have two divisions of 20 teams (Level 8). They are in different regions. The Isthmian League has three level 8 divisions of 20 teams each as well.\nLevel 9 contains the top divisions of a large group of fourteen smaller than regional leagues. Each of these leagues has a different setup. They all have one thing in common: they all have leagues below them. Each covers a smaller and smaller area.\nCup eligibility.\nBeing members of a league at a particular level also change whether a team can play certain competitions.\nIn the case of the FA Cup and the FA Vase, some of the clubs in the lowest level in each do not play. For example, in the 2017\u201318 FA Cup, there were 77 teams from Level 10 out of the 338 in total at that level.\nBelow Level 11 the pyramid becomes regional. The cups become regional or local. Lower down, the pyramid is based on counties. Counties have their own cups. This does not include some tournaments called \"Senior Cups\". These are often competitions between teams representing top professional clubs in a district. They may be little more than derbies, for example the Gloucestershire Cup. This originally included all teams in Gloucestershire, but then became a Bristol derby.\nThe system.\nThe table below shows the current structure of the system. For each division, there is its official name, sponsorship name (for levels 1\u20138, if it is different from its historic name) and number of clubs. At levels 1\u20138, each division promotes to the division that is directly above it. It relegates to the division that is directly below it. Below that level, individual league articles talk about promotion and relegation details.\nThe Premier League runs level one in the pyramid. It is the top division of English football. It is also called the Premier League. The winners are the champions of England. The English Football League (EFL) runs levels two to four. Together, these four divisions make up what is known as \"league football\".\nThe leagues below level four are classed as \"non-League football\". This means they are outside the EFL. The leagues at levels five to eleven include the National League System (NLS). They come under the direct control of the Football Association. The top-level (level 5) of the NLS is known as \"step 1\" by the FA, the next (level 6) as \"step 2\", and so on.\nThe system is only defined as far as level 10. What follows is a representation of one possible structure, should the system be defined further."}

{"id": "774775", "revid": "25400", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=774775", "title": "Ferruccio Lamborghini", "text": "Ferruccio Lamborghini (; 28 April 1916 \u2013 20 February 1993) was an Italian industrialist. In 1963, he started Lamborghini, a maker of sports cars.\nLamborghini died at the Silvestrini Hospital in Perugia after having a heart attack fifteen days before. He was 76.\nEarly life.\nFerruccio Lamborghini was born on April 28, 1916, to viticulturists Antonio and Evelina Lamborghini in house number 22 in Renazzo di Cento, in the Province of Ferrara, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. According to his baptismal certificate, Ferruccio was baptised as a Roman Catholic four days later, on 2 May.\nAs a young man, Lamborghini was drawn more to farming machinery rather than the farming lifestyle itself. Following his interest in mechanics, Lamborghini studied at the Fratelli Taddia technical institute near Bologna. In 1940 he was drafted into the Italian Royal Air Force, where he served as a mechanic at the Italian garrison on the island of Rhodes (territory of the Kingdom of Italy since 1911, after the Italo-Turkish War), becoming the supervisor of the vehicle maintenance unit. Lamborghini was taken prisoner when the island fell to the British at the end of the war in 1945, and was not able to return home until the next year. He married, but his wife died in 1947 while giving birth to his first child, a boy named Tonino.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter World War II, Lamborghini opened a garage in Pieve di Cento. Lamborghini modified an old Fiat Topolino he had purchased (the first of many that he would own over the years) in his spare time. He made use of his mechanical abilities to transform the homely city car into a roaring 750-cc open-top two-seater and entered the car in the 1948 Mille Miglia. His participation ended after 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) when he ran the car into the side of a restaurant in the town of Fiano, in Turin.\nBeginnings of entrepreneurship.\nIn 1947 Ferruccio Lamborghini recognized an emerging market in post-War Italy devoted to agricultural and industrial revitalization. Using parts from military vehicle engines and differentials from ARAR centres (Azienda Recupero Alienazione Residuati), Lamborghini built the first of his \"Carioca\" tractors, themselves based on the six-cylinder petrol engines of Morris trucks.\nAs petrol in Italy was prohibitively-priced, Lamborghini augmented the Morris engines with a fuel atomiser of his own creation, which allowed the tractors to be started with petrol, then switch to the cheaper diesel fuel. Based on the initial success of the Carioca, Lamborghini founded Lamborghini Trattori and began manufacturing tractors.\nFerruccio Lamborghini between a \"Jarama\" and a tractor\nInvolvement with boats.\nThe Iconic Riva Aquarama Lamborghini (Hull #278) was registered and delivered on 7 June 1968 to its famous owner Ferruccio Lamborghini. The boat had some specific and unique features. It was the first and only one fitted with two Lamborghini engines and it had special side railing for holding on to during waterskiing and record attempts. The engine compartment was modified to fit the engines and a special open exhaust was built just to meet Ferruccio's demands.\nFerruccio owned the boat for over 20 years until July 1988, when he then sold it to Angelo Merli, a close friend.\nSeveral speedskiing records were broken and Ferruccio was very passionate about his Riva as part of his lifestyle and exponent of Italian craft and design, maybe even just as passionate as he was about his Miura.\nInvolvement with automobiles.\nLamborghini's increasing wealth allowed him to purchase faster more expensive cars than the tiny Fiats he had tinkered with during his youth. He owned cars such as Alfa Romeos and Lancias during the early 1950s and at one point he had enough cars to use a different one every day of the week, adding a Mercedes-Benz 300SL, a Jaguar E-Type coup\u00e9, and two Maserati 3500 GTs. Of the latter, Lamborghini said, \"Adolfo Orsi, then the owner of Maserati, was a man I had a lot of respect for: he had started life as a poor boy, like myself. But I did not like his cars much. They felt heavy and did not really go very fast.\"\nIn 1958, Lamborghini traveled to Maranello to buy a Ferrari 250 GT: a two-seat coup\u00e9 with a body designed by coachbuilder Pininfarina. He went on to own several more over the years, including a Scaglietti-designed 250 GT SWB Berlinetta and a 250 GT 2+2 four-seater. Lamborghini thought Ferrari's cars were good, but too noisy and rough to be proper road cars. He categorized them as repurposed track cars with poorly built interiors.\nPeriod Ferraris had spartan interiors, lacking the plush appointments Lamborghini felt were essential to a \"gran turismo\" car\nLamborghini found that Ferrari's cars were equipped with inferior clutches, and required continuous trips to Maranello for rebuilds; technicians would secret the car away for several hours to perform the work, much to Lamborghini's annoyance. He had previously expressed dissatisfaction with Ferrari's after sales service, which he perceived to be substandard. Lamborghini brought his misgivings to Enzo Ferrari's attention, but was dismissed by the notoriously pride-filled Modenan. After successfully modifying one of his personally-owned Ferrari 250 GTs to outperform stock models, Lamborghini gained the impetus to pursue an automobile manufacturing venture of his own, aiming to create the perfect touring car that he felt no one could build for him. Lamborghini believed that a grand tourer should have attributes that were lacking in Ferrari's offerings, namely high performance without compromising tractability, ride quality, and interior appointments. A clever businessman, Lamborghini also knew that he could make triple the profit if the components used in his tractors were installed in a high-performance exotic car instead.\nAutomobili Lamborghini.\nDeparture from Macchina Lamborghini.\nDuring the 1970s, Ferruccio Lamborghini's companies began to run into financial difficulties. In 1971, Lamborghini Trattori, which exported around half of its production of tractors, ran into trouble when its South African importer cancelled all its orders. In Bolivia, the new military government, which had recently staged a successful coup d'\u00e9tat, cancelled a large order of tractors that was being prepared for shipment in Genoa. Trattori's unionised employees could not be laid off, putting immense strain on the company. In 1972, Lamborghini sold his entire holding in the company to rival tractor builder SAME.Soon, the entire Lamborghini group found itself in financial trouble. Development at the automaker slowed as costs were cut. Ferruccio Lamborghini began courting buyers for Automobili and Trattori, entering negotiations with Georges-Henri Rossetti, a wealthy Swiss businessman and friend. Ferruccio sold Rossetti 51% of the company for US$600,000, thereby relinquishing control of the automaker he had founded. He continued to work at the Sant'Agata factory; Rossetti rarely involved himself in Automobili's affairs.\nThe situation did not improve: the 1973 oil crisis plagued sales of high performance cars of manufacturers from around the world. Consumers flocked to smaller, more practical modes of transportation with better fuel economy. By 1974, Ferruccio had become disenchanted with his car business. He severed all connections with the cars that bore his name, selling his remaining 49% stake in the automaker. The shares were acquired by Ren\u00e9 Leimer, a friend of Georges-Henri Rossetti.\nAfter departing the automobile manufacturing business, Lamborghini continued his business activities in other areas, including his heating and air conditioning company, Lamborghini Calor. In 1969, he founded Lamborghini Oleodinamica S.p.A., a manufacturer of hydraulic valves and equipment.\nLater life.\nIn 1974, Lamborghini exited the industrial world and retired to a 3 km2 (740 acres) estate named \"La Fiorita\" on the shores of Lake Trasimeno, in Castiglione del Lago, a town in the Umbria region of central Italy. Returning to his farming roots, Lamborghini delighted in hunting and producing his own wines. Lamborghini even designed his own golf course, all while continuing to manage several business interests.\nLamborghini fathered a child, Patrizia, at age 58.\nAt 76 years of age, on February 20, 1993, Lamborghini died at Silvestrini Hospital in Perugia after suffering a heart attack fifteen days earlier. Lamborghini is buried at the cemetery of Renazzo.\nLamborghini's fascination with bullfighting.\nThe world of bullfighting is a key part of Lamborghini's identity. In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Lamborghini, a Taurus himself, was so impressed by the majestic Miura animals that he decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for the auto company he would soon found.\nAfter producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville.\nThe car manufacturer would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. \"Espada\" is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track. \nAfter naming the Urraco after a bull breed, in 1974, Lamborghini broke from tradition, naming the Countach not for a bull, but for \"contacc\", a Piedmontese exclamation of astonishment. Legend has it that stylist Nuccio Bertone uttered the word in surprise when he first laid eyes on the Countach prototype, \"Project 112\". The LM002 sport utility vehicle and the Silhouette were other exceptions to the tradition.\nThe Jalpa of 1982 was named after a bull breed; Diablo, after the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous for fighting an epic battle against \"El Chicorro\" in Madrid in 1869; Murci\u00e9lago, the legendary bull who survived 28 sword strokes and whose life was spared by \"El Lagartijo\" for his performance in 1879; Gallardo, named after one of the five ancestral castes of the Spanish fighting bull breed; and Revent\u00f3n, the bull that defeated young Mexican \"torero\" F\u00e9lix Guzm\u00e1n in 1943. The Estoque concept of 2008 was named after the estoc, the sword traditionally used by \"matadors\" during bullfights, while the replacement for the Murcielago, the Aventador (unveiled in 2011) was named after a bull that was bred by the sons of Don Celestino Cuadri Vides. This bull was killed in a particularly gruesome fight, where after the bull was killed, its left ear was cut off and given to the Matador as a token of good luck.\nLegacy.\nAll of Ferruccio Lamborghini's companies continue to operate today in one form or another. His son, Tonino, designs a collection of clothing and accessories under the Tonino Lamborghini brand, as well as designing the Town Life, an electric microcar which was revealed at the Bologna Motor Show in 1999. Ferruccio's daughter, Patrizia Lamborghini, runs the Lamborghini winery on his Umbria estate. In 1995 Ferruccio's son Tonino opened a museum that honors Lamborghini's legacy, the \"Centro Studi e Ricerche Ferruccio Lamborghini\" in Dosso (Ferrara), which was moved to Argelato (Bologna) in 2014 with the new name Ferruccio Lamborghini Museum"}

It is based on the Glock 17, but unlike the Glock 17, it can fire in full automatic mode. It normally holds 33-round box magazines and it fires 1,200 rounds per minute. In other words, the gun fires so quickly that it is impossible to fire single shots when in full automatic mode. While it is light enough to fire with one hand, it is not a good idea because its fast rate of fire makes the gun kick back a lot."}

{"id": "774834", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=774834", "title": "Navajo Times", "text": "The Navajo Times is a non-daily newspaper. It is written in English. It is written for the Navajo people, a group of Native Americans who live in the southwestern United States. Its mission is to tell Navajo people about events that affect their lives, both in Navajo territory and in the rest of the United States. Its main offices are in Window Rock, Arizona, but it also has another office in Shiprock, New Mexico.\nThe newspaper is owned by the Navajo Times Publishing Company, Inc., a for-profit corporation. NTPC Inc. belongs to the Navajo people, and the Tribal Council are its caretakers. Tommy Arviso Jr. is President and CEO of NTPC. According to Arviso, the paper earns enough money from selling newspapers and from advertising to pay for its own costs and a little profit. In 2015, Arviso said one of the paper's goals was to become a completely privately owned company with individual Navajo people owning shares.\nAccording to Arviso, the \"Navajo Times\" does not print \"sensational\" stories: \"We do not prey on the hurt, sadness, pain and sorrow of other humans to increase paper sales.\"\nHistory.\nThe \"Navajo Times\" started as a newsletter in 1959. The Navajo Tribal Council began it. They wanted to be able to talk to people living on Navajo land and people living in other places, for example Navajo students away at school. It became a newspaper the following year, in 1960. At first, it was a monthly newsletter, then weekly. In the early 1960s, the paper covered infrastructure-related stories like health care, education, and economic development. As of 2020, the first few years of the paper are archived in the Arizona Memory Project.\nAccording to Tom Arviso, who became editor of the paper in 1988, there were problems with censorship. Because the paper was run by the government of the Navajo nation, the Navajo leaders believed they should be allowed to say what the paper could and could not print. In 2003, Arviso convinced the Tribal Council to make the paper more independent. They voted 66 to 1 to create the Navajo Times Publishing Company so the paper would be more independent.\nAwards.\nIn 2012, the \"Navajo Times\" staff won 13 awards from the Arizona Press Club.\nIn 2015 \"Navajo Times\" staff won 24 Native Media Awards from the Native American Journalists Association, including awards for photography, sports and writing. They also won Best Layout. The paper changed its layout in 2015.\nIn 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the \"Navajo Times\" won Newspaper of the Year from the Arizona Newspapers Association in the category for non-daily newspapers. It also won awards for its website and advertising."}

These colleges try to teach broad general knowledge, different from colleges that focus on job skills. Students in a liberal arts college often major in one subject but take classes in many subjects, including both humanities and sciences. The idea of liberal arts began in Europe, but liberal arts colleges are mostly found in the United States.\nIn 2019, the top ten liberal arts colleges in the United States, according to \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", were Amherst College, Bowdoin College, Carleton College, Claremont McKenna College, Davidson College, Middlebury College, Pomona College, Swarthmore College, Wellesley College, and Williams College.\nMany liberal arts colleges teach only undergraduate students, but some also offer graduate programs that lead to a master's degree or doctoral degree. The term \"liberal arts college\" most often describes an independent college, but it may also sometimes describe a college within a larger university. Most liberal arts colleges outside the United States are like this."}

In July 2020, he became the Prime Minister of Peru under Mart\u00edn Vizcarra's administration. He left the position on 6 August 2020. He was Ollanta Humala's Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015, and Prime Minister from April 2015 to July 2016.\nBiography.\nBorn in the capital city of Lima in 1958, Cateriano pursued a law degree at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, specializing in constitutional law. During his brief term in the Peruvian Congress between 1990 and 1992, Cateriano attained a prominent role as a ranking member of the congressional investigative committee on Alan Garc\u00eda's first administration (1985-1990). Alongside Lourdes Flores and Fernando Olivera, the committee was ultimately disbanded following Garc\u00eda's acquittal by the Supreme Court in March 1992. Cateriano published in the following years a detailed work on the investigation.\nAfter a failed run for the Peruvian Congress, Cateriano worked extensively in opposition to Alberto Fujimori's presidency, ultimately being appointed to the Constitutional Reform Advisory Body of the Ministry of Justice in the presidency of Valent\u00edn Paniagua. Subsequently, he was appointed under Alejandro Toledo's presidency as Deputy Minister of Justice, serving until his resignation in June 2002, alongside minister and former colleague, Fernando Olivera.\nDuring the presidency of Ollanta Humala, Cateriano served as Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015. In his almost three-year tenure, he remained a controversial member of Humala's administration, constantly clashing with the opposition regarding the government's modus operandi, in which First Lady Nadine Heredia seemingly interfered with government decisions. He also faced criticism for his support of pecuniary sanctions on voluntary military service enrollment, which the Constitutional Court declared the measure unconstitutional. Upon the resignation of Ana Jara on 2 April 2015, due to her being censured by the Peruvian Congress regarding illegal government espionage under her management as Prime Minister of Peru, Cateriano was appointed as her successor. Seemed by pundits as a government loyalist, he served through the end of Humala's presidency.\nCateriano was sworn as Prime Minister of Peru on 15 July 2020, succeeding Vicente Zeballos as the government faces strong criticism due to Vizcarra's management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. He would serve until 4 August 2020, less than three weeks in office, as Congress voted against his confirmation and left office on 6 August 2020."}

There are 9x19mm Parabellum models and .40 S&amp;W models of the gun. Although the gun was largely based on the M1911, there were several major changes made. Since it was finished outside the United States and since it fired the non-American 9mm bullet, the Hi-Power was not used very much in the US. However, it was very popular outside the US. In fact, it was one of the most used military pistols ever. As of 2017, it was still being used or was only recently replaced in over 50 countries.\nThe Browning Hi-Power has many other names such as the HP, BAP, BHP, GP, P-35, and HP-35. It was called the \"Hi-Power\" because it could hold a large number of bullets. It could hold 13 9mm bullets when other pistols at the time held far fewer. For example, the Luger only held 8 bullets and the M1911 only held 7."}

The P90 has a rare feature where the box magazine is loaded parallel to the gun's barrel rather than perpendicular to it. Each magazine can hold 50 bullets. The P90 fires at a fast 900 rounds per minute (RPM). The P90 is fully ambidextrous, which means both right-handed and left-handed people can use the gun without any problems. It weighs only 2.6 kilograms (5.6 pounds) and is only 50.5 centimeters (19.9 inches) long. It is even small and light enough to fire with one hand. The P90 is very common in militaries and police forces in NATO countries. A semi-automatic only version called the PS-90 can be bought and used for civilian purposes."}

The parents of St. Arnulf of Metz were said to have given all they owned \"in villa Reistete\" (in the city of Rethel) to St. Remigius, bishop of Reims, so that their prayers for a child would be answered. The city belonged to the Abbey of Saint-Remi and was administered by its advocati. One of them, Manasses I, became the first Count of Rethel. In 1481 the county, with Rethel as its seat, became the Peerage of France; it became a duchy in 1581 and in 1663 it became the Duchy of Mazarin. During the Franco-Spanish War it was captured by Spanish forces under Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9 on October 30, 1652 after a four-year siege, but was retaken by the French in July 1653. In 1814 Spanish prisoners of war from the Napoleonic Wars introduced typhus to the city. Jean-Baptiste Reberotte-Labesse cared for the soldiers who were ill. Cholera epidemics occurred in 1832 and 1849, while typhoid fever ravaged the city in 1839, with an average of thirty deaths a day.

Trump, the niece of Donald Trump. It is a \"tell-all\" book, which means it is a biography about Donald Trump written without his permission. The Trump family filed a lawsuit against the book by saying it violated a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). An NDA means that a person cannot reveal confidential information to the public. However, they could not stop the book from being published on July 14, 2020.\nBackground.\nMary Trump is a psychologist who works with patients. She has done research on victims of stalking and on schizophrenia. She is the daughter of Fred Trump, Jr. and granddaughter of Fred Trump.\nIn 1999, Mary and her brother Fred III went to court because they didn't agree with the conditions in Fred Sr.'s will. They said that Fred Sr.'s other children influenced him so that the will would not give them as much money as they think they deserved. Because they went to trial, the family cut off both of them from health insurance, which put Fred's son, who had epilepsy, in great danger. The lawsuit was settled and they got their insurance back.\nAfter her uncle became president, there were questions about whether or not he paid his fair share in taxes. Mary gave \"The New York Times\" a box of financial documents that proved that he did not and that he was engaged in fraud.\nSummary.\nThis book is chronological. That means it is organized by time. Mary doesn't diagnose Donald with any specific disorders. Instead she uses psychology to analyze parts of his history to give suggestions on what might be wrong with him.\nPart One: The Cruelty is the Point.\nThis part of the book describes Fred Trump as a sociopath who uses others to help himself. Donald learns from Fred how to not show feelings of weakness nor how to be kind to others. This is in contrast to Fred Jr., who was constantly scolded for not learning to be a cruel person like Fred Sr. Because of this training, Donald fails to learn about all the possible feelings that people experience. To the relief of his mother, he is sent to military school.\nPart Two: The Wrong Side of the Tracks.\nIn Part 2, Donald becomes a businessman. However, Fred Sr. puts Donald as the public face of the family business while he takes care of much of the actual business. Fred Jr. chooses to leave the family business and become a pilot. He is rejected by his family for this choice, which leads to him becoming an alcoholic and the end of his pilot career and his marriage. He died of a heart attack at a hospital while Donald was at a movie theater.\nPart Three: Smoke and Mirrors.\nThis part of the books talks about how Donald is not a good businessman. The only reason he is not allowed to fail is because his businesses partners won't let him; him failing makes them look bad. At one point, he has to negotiate with creditors so that he can get an allowance of $450,000 per month.\nThe family cuts her and her brother out of Fred's will. She, her brother, and her brother's son lose their health insurance. They settle when she allows the rest of the family to buy out her share of a corporation at a price lower than what it should be.\nPart Four: The Worst Investment Ever Made.\nHere, Mary talks about Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. She uses her psychologist knowledge to show how he used his worst traits to his own advantage. She says that Donald is able to be manipulated by others who recognize his weaknesses.\nClaims.\nMary Trump makes some claims in the book. She says that:\nRelease.\nThe book was supposed to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on August 11, 2020. However, they moved the publication date to July 14 because so many people wanted to read it.\nDonald Trump said that Mary signed a \"very powerful\" agreement that \"covers everything,\" so she was \"not allowed to write a book.\"\nRobert Trump, one of Mary's uncles, sued on June 23 to stop the book from being published. A judge in the Queens County Surrogate Court (a court that handles wills) dismissed the case. Trump then took the case to a state court. On June 30, a judge there ordered that the book not be published until a hearing was held on July 10. On July 1, another more powerful judge reversed that order and allowed Simon &amp; Schuster to publish the book. On July 2, Mary Trump made an affidavit saying that she was not bound by the NDA because the agreement was fraudulent.\nReception.\nMost people said good things about the book. They were impressed with how she used her psychology knowledge to tell a story about her family.\nOne man, Chris Taylor, said she did not write a good book because she made a lot of big claims and contradicted herself."}

This act of revenge is usually done without asking the victim. \nRevenge porn usually means making sexually explicit videos, books and movies about a person because the person ended a relationship. The possession of the material may be used by the partners to punish the victim for ending a relationship.\nSeveral areas have passed laws against revenge porn. They include Israel, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and most of the \nUnited States.\nIn the 1980s the \"Hustler\" magazine began a monthly show of reader-submitted images of naked women called the \"Beaver Hunt\". The Beaver Hunt photos were usually with details of these women, such as their hobby and their names. Some of the women sued the magazine for publishing their photos without their permission.\nBut it wasn't until 2010 that revenge porn \"really\" took off. That year, \nHunter Moore launched the website \"IsAnyoneUp\". The website was similar to the Beaver Hunt. The first person who spoke against Moore was activist Charlotte Laws. She was also one of the first people to publicly support revenge pornography victims.\nIn June 2015 Google decided they would remove links to revenge porn on request.

Scientists had some ideas how evolution works. Because some of these theories contradict the literal intepretation of the creation myth in the Book of Genesis, religious people and organizations questioned these ideas. For a long time, only the priests could read the Bible, which was written in Latin or in Greek. It was only the priests who interpreted the texts in the Bible. The priests often said that the Book of Genesis shoild not be read literally and taught it as an allegory. With the advent of the printing press, the Bible was translated into other languagres. More people were able to read and write, and more literal understandings of scripture flourished. This allowed some religious persons and groups to challenge scientists who supported evolution, such as biologists Thomas Henry Huxley and Ernst Haeckel.\nCreation\u2013evolution controversy in the age of Darwin.\n The first people to speak about evolution were Empedocles and other Greek philosophers in Europe (5th century BCE), Taoism in Asia. The history of evolutionary thought in Christian theology dates back to Augustine of Hippo (4th century) and Thomas Aquinas (13th century). The modern creation\u2013evolution controversy started in Europe and North America in the late 18th century. Discoveries in geology led to various theories of an ancient earth, and fossils showing past extinctions prompted early ideas of evolution. These ideas were particularly controversial in England, where both the natural world and the hierarchical social order were thought to be fixed by God's will. As the terrors of the French Revolution developed into the Napoleonic Wars, followed by economic depression threatening revolution in Great Britain itself, such subversive ideas were rejected, associated only with radical agitators.\nWhen the economy recovered, things improved.When the book \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" was anonymously published in 1844 its ideas of transmutation of species attracted wide public interest. The work was also attacked by the scientific establishment and many theologians who believed it to be in conflict with their interpretations of the biblical account of life's, especially humanity's, origin and development. However, radical Quakers, Unitarians and Baptists welcomed the book's ideas of \"natural law\" as supporting their struggle to overthrow the privileges of the Church of England.\n\"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" remained a best-seller- It paved the way for widespread interest in the theory of natural selection. English naturalist Charles Darwin introduced this ideas in his 1859 book, \"On the Origin of Species\". Darwin's book was praised by Unitarians as well as by liberal Anglican theologians praised Darwin's book. Their \"Essays and Reviews\" (1860) was more controversial in Britain than Darwin's publication. Its support of higher criticism questioned the historical accuracy of literal interpretations of the Bible and added declarations that miracles were irrational.\nDarwin's book revolutionized the way naturalists viewed the world. The book and its promotion attracted attention and controversy, and many theologians reacted to Darwin's theories. For example, in his 1874 work \"What is Darwinism?\" the theologian Charles Hodge argued that Darwin's theories were like atheism. Thomas Henry Huxley, added to the controversy when he wrote that Christianity is a \"...compound of some of the best and some of the worst elements of Paganism and Judaism. [influenced by] certain people of the Western world...\" Perhaps the most uncompromising of the evolutionary philosophers was Ernst Haeckel, who dogmatically affirmed that nothing spiritual exists.\nA fundamenal change in the Protestant objections to evolution occurred after about 1875. Previously, citing Louis Agassiz and other scientific luminaries, Protestant contributors to religious quarterlies dismissed Darwin's theories as unscientific. After 1875, it became clear that the majority of naturalists were in favor of evolution, and a sizable minority of these Protestant contributors rejected Darwin's theory because it called into question the veracity of Scriptures. Even so, virtually none of these dissenters insisted on a young Earth.\nThe greatest concern for creationists in the late 19th century was the issue of human ancestry. In the words of an 1896 religious tract:\nCreationists during this period were largely premillennialists; their belief in Christ's return depended on a quasi-literal reading of the Bible. However, they were not as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the Edenic creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings. In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth, the progressive nature of the fossil record. Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists. Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of Genesis, or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days.\nScopes Trial.\nAt the start, the reaction in the United States matched the developments in Britain, and when Alfred Russel Wallace went there for a lecture tour in 1886\u20131887 his explanations of \"Darwinism\" were welcomed without any problems, but attitudes changed after the First World War. The controversy became political when public schools began teaching that man evolved from earlier forms of life per Darwin's theory of natural selection. In response, the U.S. state of Tennessee passed the Butler Act of 1925 prohibiting the teaching of any theory of the origins of humans that contradicted the teachings of the Bible. This law was tested in the highly publicized Scopes Trial of 1925. The law was upheld by the Tennessee Supreme Court, and remained on the books until 1967 when it was repealed. In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Epperson v. Arkansas\" that banning the teaching of specific theories contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because their primary purpose was religious.\nICR and the co-opting of the \"creationist\" label.\nJohn C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris' influential \"The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications\" was published in 1961. The authors argued that creation was literally six days long, that humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs, and that God created each kind of life. When it was published, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences. Morris set up the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC), an organization dominated by Baptists, as an adjunct to the Christian Heritage College. The CSRC rushed publication of biology text books that promoted creationism. These efforts were against the recommendations of Morris, who urged a more cautious and scientific approach. Ultimately, the CSRC broke up, and Morris founded the Institute for Creation Research in 1970. Morris promised that the ICR, unlike the CSRC, would be controlled and operated by scientists. During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology, adopted the scientific sounding terms \"scientific creationism\" and \"creation science\". The flood geologists effectively co-opted \"the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views.\" Previously, \"creationism\" was a generic term describing a philosophical perspective that presupposes the existence of a supernatural creator.\nThe Catholic Church and evolution.\nAmong the first recorded responses of a prominent Roman Catholic clergyman to Darwin's theory was that of the Blessed John Henry Newman, who in 1868, in a letter to a fellow priest, made the following comments:\nSome point to the fact that before ordination all Catholic priests have to study the teachings of Thomas Aquinas, who subscribed to an Aristotelian view of evolution, in which he posits that animal species evolve by means of mutations and natural law.\nMore recent statements have been made by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI that also support a theistic understanding of evolution.\nThe current controversy.\nThe controversy continues to this day. Ctrstionist organizations actively attack the scientific consensus on the origins and evolution of life.Many religious groups want to promote other forms of creationism (usually young Earth creationism (YEC), creation science, old Earth creationism or intelligent design (ID)) as an alternative. Most of these groups are explicitly Christian, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to evangelize.\nSome see science and religion has views that are so different that they cannot be reconciled. Mainstream churches and some scientists consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought, which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and propose different ways of investigating it.\nMore recently, the intelligent design movement has taken an anti-evolution position which avoids any direct appeal to religion. However, Leonard Krishtalka, a paleontologist and an opponent of the movement, has called intelligent design \"nothing more than creationism in a cheap tuxedo,\" and, in \"Kitzmiller v.Dover Area School District\" (2005) United States District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that \"intelligent design is not science,\" but is \"grounded in theology\" and \"cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.\" Before the trial began, U.S. President George W. Bush commented endorsing the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution \"I felt like both sides ought to be properly taught ... so people can understand what the debate is about.\" Scientists argue that intelligent design does not represent any research program within the scientific community, and is opposed by most of the same groups who oppose creationism."}

It used to live in Thailand but may be extinct there.\nThis cat is 45 to 52 cm long (18 to 20 inches) and its tail is another 12 to 17 cm long (4.7 to 7 inches). It weights 1.5 to 2.5 kilograms (3.3 to 5.5 pounds). It is about the size of a domestic cat but its legs and tail are shorter, its body is longer, its paws are rounder, and its head is flatter. Its fur is red-brown and dark brown and it has white marks on its face and a white belly. Unlike most cats' claws, the flat-headed cat's claws do not retract all the way.\nThe flat-headed cat lives in low rainforests, swamps, lakes, and forests with rivers in them. It catches its food in the water, and its body helps: Its teeth point backwards in its mouth so fish cannot get away. Its jaws are longer and narrower than other cats' jaws. It has some webbing between its toes.\nSome scientists think this cat likes water even more than the fishing cat does. When some scientists studying apes caught a flat-headed cat by accident, they let it go between a forest and a river. The cat ran to the river and dove in instead of running to the trees to hide. The scientists thought that the cat felt safer in the water than in the trees.\nLike other cats, the flat-headed cat sprays urine to mark its territory, but while other cats stand up and spray onto a tall object like a tree. The flat-headed cat crouches down and sprays while it walks, leaving its urine on the ground.\nThe flat-headed cat is pregnant for 56 days. Female cats have one to four kittens at a time. In zoos, a flat-headed cat can live 14 years.\nFlat-headed cats are endangered because of pollution and because humans catch too many fish but mostly because humans have cut down the forests to build farms. Flat-headed cats like forests that are not too far above sea level, and this makes good farmland, so humans want it. Some scientists think that flat-headed cats can live in forests that have grown back after being cut down. Scientists do not think the flat-headed cat can hunt and live near farms the way the Iriomote cat does."}

It uses biological leavening rather than cultivated baker's yeast. The lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli gives it a more sour taste and improved keeping qualities.\nHistory.\nIn the \"Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology\", Michael Gaenzle writes: \"The origins of bread-making are so ancient that everything said about them must be pure speculation. One of the oldest sourdough breads dates from 3700 BCE and was excavated in Switzerland, but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent several thousand years earlier ... Bread production relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent for most of human history; the use of baker's yeast as a leavening agent dates back less than 150 years.\"\nPliny the Elder described the sourdough method in his \"Natural History\":\nSourdough remained the usual form of leavening down into the European Middle Ages. Im modern times, barm from the beer brewing process replaced it, at first. Later, there was specially grown yeast. \nBread made from 100% rye flour is popular in the northern half of Europe. It is usually leavened with sourdough. Baker's yeast is not useful as a leavening agent for rye bread, because rye does not contain enough gluten. The structure of rye bread is based primarily on the starch in the flour, as well as other carbohydrates known as pentosans. however, rye amylase is active at much higher temperatures than wheat amylase, causing the structure of the bread to disintegrate as the starches are broken down during cooking. The lowered pH of a sourdough starter, therefore, inactivates the amylases when heat cannot, allowing the carbohydrates in the bread to gel and set properly. In the southern part of Europe, where panettone was originally made with sourdough, sourdough has become less common in recent times. It has been replaced by the faster-growing baker's yeast. Sometimes longer fermentation rests are used to allow for some bacterial activity to build flavor.\nIn English-speaking countries, wheat-based breads arte more common. Sourdough is no longer the standard method for bread leavening. It was gradually replaced, first by the use of barm from beer making, then, after the confirmation of germ theory by Louis Pasteur, by cultured yeasts. Although sourdough bread was superseded in commercial bakeries in the 20th century, it has undergone a revival among artisan bakers.\nManufacturers of non-sourdough breads make up for the lack of yeast and bacterial culture by introducing into their dough an artificially-made mix known as bread improver or flour improver.\nPreparation.\nStarter.\nThe preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment (the \"starter\" or \"leaven\", also known as the \"chief\", \"chef\", \"head\", \"mother\" or \"sponge\"), a fermented mixture of flour and water, containing a colony of microorganisms including wild yeast and lactobacilli. The purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters.\nFlour already contains different kinds of yeast and bacteria spores. When flour comes in contact with water, the enzyme amylase breaks down the starch into different sugars. The yeast which is part of sourdough, can use these sugars. The mixture will develop into a stable bacteria culture, which will use fermentation. The yeast will produce carbon dioxide as a by-product of fermentation, which will leaven the dough. \nObtaining a satisfactory rise from sourdough takes longer than a dough leavened with baker's yeast because the yeast in a sourdough is less vigorous. In the presence of lactic acid bacteria, however, some sourdough yeasts have been observed to produce twice the gas of baker's yeast. The acidic conditions in sourdough, along with the bacteria also producing enzymes that break down proteins, result in weaker gluten and may produce a denser finished product.\nRefreshment of the starter.\nAs it ferments, sometimes for several days, the volume of the starter is increased by periodic additions of flour and water, called \"refreshments\". As long as this starter culture is fed flour and water regularly it will remain active.\nThe ratio of fermented starter to fresh flour and water is critical in the development and maintenance of a starter. This ratio is called the \"refreshment ratio\". Higher refreshment ratios are associated with greater microbial stability in the sourdough. In San Francisco sourdough, the ratio is 40% of the total weight, which is roughly equivalent to 67% of the new-dough's weight. A high refreshment ratio keeps acidity of the refreshed dough relatively low. Acidity levels of below pH 4.0 inhibit lactobacilli and favour acid-tolerant yeasts.\nA starter prepared from scratch with a salted wheat-rye dough takes about 54 hours at to stabilise at a pH between 4.4 and 4.6. 4% salt inhibits \"L. sanfranciscensis\", while \"C. milleri\" can withstand 8%.\nA drier and cooler starter has less bacterial activity and more yeast growth, which results in the bacterial production of more acetic acid relative to lactic acid. Conversely, a wetter and warmer starter has more bacterial activity and less yeast growth, with more lactic acid relative to acetic acid. The yeasts produce mainly CO2 and ethanol. High amounts of lactic acid are desired in rye and mixed-rye fermentations, while relatively higher amounts of acetic acid are desired in wheat fermentations. A dry, cool starter produces a sourer loaf than a wet, warm one. Firm starters (such as the Flemish Desem starter, which may be buried in a large container of flour to prevent drying out) tend to be more resource-intensive than wet ones.\nIntervals between refreshments.\nA stable culture in which \"L. sanfranciscensis\" is the dominant bacterium requires a temperature between and refreshments every 24 hours for about two weeks. Refreshment intervals of longer than three days acidify the dough and may change the microbial ecosystem.\nThe intervals between refreshments of the starter may be reduced in order to increase the rate of gas (CO2) production, a process described as \"acceleration.\" In this process, the ratio of yeasts to lactobacilli may be altered. Generally, if once-daily refreshment-intervals have not been reduced to several hours, the percentage amount of starter in the final dough should be reduced to obtain a satisfactory rise during proof.\nFaster starter processes, requiring fewer refreshments, have been devised, sometimes using commercial sourdough starters as inoculants. These starters generally fall into two types. One is made from traditionally maintained and stable starter doughs, often dried, in which the ratios of microorganisms are uncertain. Another is made from microorganisms carefully isolated from Petri dishes, grown into large, homogeneous populations in fermentors, and processed into combined baker's products with numerically defined ratios and known quantities of microorganisms well suited to particular bread styles.\nBaking.\nThe starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough, by mixing flour and water to the starter. This creates an active leaven, which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is bubbly and floats in water. The leaven is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the total flour weight, though formulas may vary. The dough is shaped into loaves, left to rise, and then baked. A number of 'no knead' methods are available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking. This process is known as 'retardation' to slow down the proofing process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread.\nBecause the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker's yeasts, sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine. However, sourdough that has been proved over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine's paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine's loaf tin."}

They belonged to the Somali Muslim sultanate that ruled over large parts of the Horn of Africa in the Middle Ages. Because of their centralized administration and strong military, they were able to resist an attack by the Ottoman empire. This was called Gaal Madow. The fought a number of wars with the Portugese, and were able to withstand them. After the war, trade routes were re-established or strengthened. In the coastal provinces, trade flourished. Ships sailed to and came from many kingdoms and empires in East Asia, South Asia, Europe, the Near East, North Africa and East Africa.\nThe empire was very important, and built many castles and fortresses. Some of them can still be seen, mostly in the southern part of Somalia. There are also a number of pillar tombs, necropolises, and cities built during that era, which are now in ruins, which are attributed to Ajuran engineers. During the Ajuran period, many regions and people in the southern part of the Horn of Africa converted to Islam because of the theocratic nature of the government. The royal family, the House of Garen, expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.\nThe Ajuran also controlled the water resources. They built wells and cisterns on the rivers Shebelle and Jubba. Many of these wells are still working. The rulers also developed a new system of agriculture and taxation, which were used in parts of the Horn of Africa until the 19th century. The later rulers of the Ajuran were not as successful: There were rebellions, and by the late 17th century the empire had fallen apart into a number of smaller states. The most prominent of these was probably the Geledi Sultanate."}

It is the story of an Igbo man, Obi Okonkwo, who leaves his village for an education in Britain and then a job in the Nigerian colonial civil service. He faces a conflict between his Western lifestyle and African culture and ends up taking a bribe.\nTitle.\nThe title of the novel comes from the poem The Journey of the Magi by T.S. Eliot.\nWe returned to our places, these Kingdoms,&lt;br&gt;\nBut no longer at ease here,&lt;br&gt;\nWith an alien people clutching their gods.&lt;br&gt;\nI should be glad of another death.\nSummary.\nObi Okonko is the grandson of Okonkwo, the main character of Achebe's first novel, \"Things Fall Apart\". Obi is on trial for taking a bribe.\nSome members of the Umuofia Progressive Union (UPU) collect money so that Obi can go to England to study law and help his people. However, he starts studying English instead of law. He meets Clara Okeke, who is studying to be a nurse, at a dance.\nObi returns to Nigeria. He now lives with a friend in Lagos and works for the government as part of the Scholarship Board, which is responsible for giving scholarships to students. A man offers a bribe on behalf of his sister, which Obi rejects. The girl herself visits Obi and tries to bribe him with sex for a scholarship, which he also rejects.\nObi is falling in love with Clara. However, he finds out that Clara is an \"osu\", or outcast in Igbo society. Because of her status, he cannot marry her. His father reluctantly refuses to let him marry her because he is a Christian and wants to leave the \"heathen\" ways of precolonial Igbo society. His mother begs him to not marry Clara until after she dies. When Obi tells Clara this, she calls off the engagement and reveals that she is pregnant. Obi arranges for her to get an abortion. He gets more into debt because he needs to repay the UPU, fund his siblings' educations, and pay for the abortion. \nObi becomes depressed when he finds out that his mother died. He does not go to her funeral. When he recovers, he reluctantly begins to take bribes and accepts that bribery is the way of his world.\nAt the end of the novel, Obi takes a bribe, which he promises to himself would be the last one he would take. This turns out to be a sting operation and he is arrested.\nThemes.\n\"No Longer at Ease\" takes place several decades after \"Things Fall Apart\". At this point, the British are in full control of Nigeria. Obi finds that he is in the middle of a conflict between the African expectation of financially supporting his family and village and living a Western lifestyle.\nObi Okonkwo is the grandson of Okonkwo from \"Things Fall Apart\". Both men speak their minds and are self-destructive. While Okonkwo is a man of action, Obi is a man who doesn't take much action because he uses thoughts and words more."}

It was inspired by Islamic socialism, Arab nationalism, African nationalism and the principles of direct democracy.\nThe Third International Theory was meant to be an alternative to capitalism and communism, which Gaddafi felt were not appropriate for the countries of the Third World (not allies with either the US or the Soviet Union).\nIn 2011, the Libyan government based on this political theory was overthrown and Gaddafi was killed.\nBackground.\nHistorical context.\nIn the 1960s and 70s, an ideology called Islamic socialism became popular in the Arab world. People believed that socialism should be combined with the principles of Islam so that there would be a more fair and just world. Many people believed that capitalism and communism were both disrespectful of Islam and allowed other countries to control them.\nOn September 1, 1969, a group of Libyan army officers overthrew the king and established a republic. This republic was ruled by a Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) that was led by a young colonel whose name was Muammar Gadaffi.\nThe revolution was against imperialism. On October 7, they told the UN that foreign bases would not be allowed on Libyan soil.\nIn 1973, the country was renamed Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. \"Jamahiriya\" is an Arabic word that means \"People's Republic.\"\nBeliefs.\nThe beliefs of the Third International Theory are described in Gadaffi's \"Green Book\". The book is divided into three parts:\n\"People Power\".\nThe first part of \"The Green Book\" is called \"Solving the problem of democracy: The Authority of the People.\" The theory says that a country should not be holding a referendum, have a political party, or have a parliament. Gaddafi believed that these are not things a true democracy should have.\nPeople's Congress.\nIn the Jamahiriya, everyone is part of the People's Congresses, which then elect the People's Committees. The Committees then elect the next Congresses, which then elect the State Committees, which run the government. Once a year, the People's Congresses meet up at the General People's Congress, which makes decisions and where issues are discussed.\nFreedom of Speech.\nGadaffi believed that everyone should have the right to speak their minds, no matter how irrational their beliefs are. He believed that having freedom of speech was important for democracy.\nSocialism.\nThe second part of the book, \"The solution of the economic problem (Socialism),\" explains the economic parts of the Third International Theory.\nSociety.\nWomen.\n\"The Green Book\" talks about women, specifically:\nGaddafi said that \"human rights are for everyone\u2014men and women, but the responsibilities are not equal.\"\nBlack people.\nGadaffi believed that Black people would rule the world and that there is nothing anyone can do to prevent them from doing so. He says they will take over because they accept polygamy and reject birth control.\nAs time went on, Libya started to associate itself more with the rest of Africa than with the Arab world.\nSports.\nFor this reason, stadiums were only open for military parades and wrestling was banned in Libya.\nIslam.\n\"The Green Book\" does not talk about Islam. However, Gaddafi said that the validity of Islam was to be shown by how much it matches the Third International Theory. He said, \"if we were to restrict ourselves to the support of Muslims only, that would be an example of bigotry and selfishness: True Islam is the one that defends the weak, even if they are not Muslims\"\nApplication in Libya.\nGaddafi tried to put the Third International Theory into practice in Libya. He called the government based on the theory \"Jamahiriya\" (), which means \"people's republic\" or \"state of the masses.\" It is different from \"Jumhuriyah\" (), which is the Arabic word for \"republic.\" He wanted to show that the government system based on the Third International Theory was different from all previous forms of government (specifically monarchies and republics)."}

She wanted to become a teacher. There was no secondary school in Norway House so she had to leave home for further education. She spent two years at Guy Hill Residential School, just outside The Pas, Manitoba, a town of European Canadians, M\u00e9tis, and Cree people. In the fall of 1971, Osborne attended Margaret Barbour Collegiate in The Pas. Back then in Canada, a collegiate institute was a high school for students who wanted to go to university. She stayed with the Bensons, a non-aboriginal family.\nOn the evening of her death, Osborne had spent time with friends at The Northern Lite Cafe and then at the Bensons' place before heading back downtown. Around midnight, Osborne's friends returned home; not much is known about where Osborne was or what she was doing after that. She was walking home at approximately 2:30 a.m. when she was abducted, beaten, and stabbed with a screwdriver over 50 times. The following day, a boy named Kenny Gurba discovered her naked body. He and his father called the police.\nMurder investigation.\nPolice at first suspected her ex-boyfriend, Cornelius Bighetty. His name was cleared after successfully passing a lie detector test. She and Cornelius had an argument earlier in the evening at the Cambrian Hotel. At first, attention was placed on Betty's friends. Unfortunately, poor recording and preserving of evidence at the Pump House (the crime scene) seriously affected the investigation.\nDwayne Archie Johnston, James Robert Paul Houghton, Lee Scott Colgan and Norman Bernard Manger, four young white men from The Pas, were accused of killing her. However, it was not until December 1987, sixteen years after her death, that any of them were convicted of the crime. It was at this time that Constable Rob Urbanowski took over the investigation and placed an ad in the local newspaper asking for witnesses to come forward. Even then, only Johnston was convicted, as Houghton had been acquitted, Colgan had received immunity for testifying against Houghton and Johnston, and Manger was never charged.\nThe Aboriginal Justice Implementation Commission did an investigation into concerns about how long it took to solve her case. According to the Commission report, Osborne's autopsy showed that \"along with well over 50 stab wounds, her skull, cheekbones and palate were broken, her lungs were damaged, and one kidney was torn. Her body showed extensive bruising.\" The Commission concluded that the most significant factors prolonging the case were racism, sexism and indifference of white people.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police officially closed the Osborne case on February 12, 1999.\nAftermath.\nA formal apology from the Manitoba government was given by Gord Mackintosh, Manitoba's Minister of Justice, on July 14, 2000. The apology addressed the failure of the province's justice system in Osborne's case. The province also created a scholarship in Osborne's name for Aboriginal women.\nThe Pas, Manitoba, is still affected by this event. Recently, there has been a movement by the Aboriginal community to build healthier communities and this is having a positive impact on the town and surrounding community.\nTo remember Helen Betty Osborne, the town of Norway House named a school after her. The University of Winnipeg's Wii Chiiwaakanak Learning Centre is located in a building named after Osborne. \nOn March 26, 2008, the Osborne family again grieved as her brother was found slain in his apartment in downtown Winnipeg. It was Winnipeg's sixth homicide of 2008.\nCultural references.\nOn December 2, 2008, a graphic novel entitled 'The Life of Helen Betty Osborne' was published by The Helen Betty Osborne Memorial Foundation. The purpose of the graphic novel was to educate youth about racism, sexism, and indifference.\nCanadian Indie-Folk Rock band The Wooden Sky has produced a four-song EP entitled \"The Lonesome Death of Helen Betty Osborne\" and has also released a song with the same title on their full-length album \"When Lost At Sea\" in recognition of Osborne. Lyrics to the song discuss the night of Osborne's murder.\nRobert Munsch, a Canadian children's author, discussed his experience of being walked to the grave of Helen Betty Osborne one year before her perpetrators were captured. He discussed how this single incident led to a complete evolution not only in his writing as a children's author, but also in his philosophy of life.\nThe Osborne case is a considered an influence on Tomson Highway's \"The Rez Sisters\" (1986). The character Zhaboonigan Peterson, a mentally challenged young woman, performs a monologue in which she describes being raped by two white men with a screwdriver (Osborne was stabbed 56 times with a screwdriver). Highway attended junior high school in The Pas and graduated a year before Osborne's rape and murder.\nIn 1991, a CBC TV miniseries about the Osborne kidnapping and murder was made, entitled \"Conspiracy of Silence\"."}

Additionally, they were responsible for the protection and fortification of towns and citadels, they were also the gods of defense and sports.

It was released on April 12, 2011 on Roswell and RCA Records. It was the first Foo Fighters album with guitarist Pat Smear playing on it since \"The Colour and the Shape\" (1997) as a member. He did play on \"Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace\" (2007) as a guest.\nWhen making the album, the band did not want to use digital recording as they wanted to sound how they did in their first albums. The album was made in the garage of Dave Grohl, the lead singer and guitarist of the band. The house was in Encino, California. The album was made on only analog equipment. It was produced by Butch Vig. Vig had worked with Grohl in 1991 and 1992 to produce Nirvana's album \"Nevermind\". The band spent three weeks making sure they could play the songs well before recording, as no mistakes can be fixed after recording on analog equipment. There were also guests who played on the album, such as Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffee and Fee Waybill.\nSix singles were released from the album. The most successful was Rope, which went straight to number one on \"Billboard\"'s Rock Songs chart. It was only the second ever single to go straight to number one on this chart. \"Wasting Light\" went straight to number one on the albums charts of twelve countries. Critics said mainly good things about the album, mainly about the production and songwriting. In 2012, \"Wasting Light\" won four Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album.\nBackground.\nAfter the \"Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace\" concert tour ended in 2008, the Foo Fighters went to Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood, California to record 14 songs. They wanted to release these quickly, without advertising or promoting them. They then changed their mind and took a break instead. Three of these songs were released: \"Wheels\", \"Word Forward\", and \"Rope\". The first two were released as part of the \"Greatest Hits\" album and \"Rope\" was released on \"Wasting Light\". \"Wheels\" and \"Word Forward\" were produced by Butch Vig, which is what made Dave Grohl decide to work with him to make a new album. Grohl had worked with Vig when he was in Nirvana to make the album \"Nevermind\".\nDave Grohl had the idea of making a new album in 2010, while he was touring in Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. He wanted to make a documentary of making the album. He also didn't want to make it in an expensive studio with new equipment, but instead wanted to use the same equipment used in the 1990s. He later also said he didn't want it to be the best album they had made, but he wanted it to be the one people would know them for best. He said it would be a lot like \"Back in Black\" for Amy Winehouse or \"The Black Album\" for Metallica. The album was also the first to have guitarist Pat Smear. Smear had left the band after the album \"The Colour and the Shape\" in 1997.\n\"Wasting Light\" was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage at his home in Encino, California. The Foo Fighters' other albums were recorded Studio 606, which was built by the band. Grohl said that he \"wanted to make records the way we used to fucking make records\", instead of making them in a new studio with new equipment.\nThe album was made using only analog equipment. Digital equipment was only used after the album was made. Grohl did this as he thought digital recording was \"getting out of control\". He also said that when he heard new music, all he could hear was drum machines. He didn't like the idea of not using real musical instruments.\nWhen producer Butch Vig heard that the band wanted to use analog equipment, he thought they were joking. Vig then said that the band would have to play very well. This is because mistakes on analog tape cannot be fixed. The band then practiced for three weeks in Studio 606 and chose the songs to use on the album. They started with 40 songs that they had and chose fourteen.\nRecording.\nGrohl's garage had microphones and sound baffles on the garage door and behind the drums. There was also a carpet under the drums. This stopped sound from leaking outside of the garage. The small room next to the study was used as a room to record vocals. A tent was set up in the back yard for the control room. There were two cameras set up in the garage that linked to a television in the tent so that the band could talk to the producer in the tent. The same equipment that was used to make \"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\" and \"One by One\" in Grohl's house in Alexandria, Virginia were used to make \"Wasting Light\".\nPersonnel.\nFoo Fighters\nAdditional musicians\nProduction\nArtwork"}

Ten to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone. The chicks are fed by both parents, and second broods are common. \nThis little bird is always on the move as it searches for insects to eat.

It also refers to the development of the embryo in the egg under good environmental conditions. \nSince birds are warm-blooded, they sit on the eggs to keep them warm. Reptiles and invertebrates are cold-blooded, and so need to keep their eggs in warm places. Sometimes even birds need the help of the Sun.\nMany factors may be vital to the incubation. In some reptiles for example, no fixed temperature is necessary. However, the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds, by contrast, the sex of offspring is genetically determined, but a constant and particular temperature may be necessary for successful incubation.\nIn poultry, the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called 'brooding'. The action or tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called \"broodiness\"."}

Starting 1959, English law speaks about \"mental illness\".\nHistory.\nThe term \"lunatic\" was originally used to refer mainly to epilepsy and madness, as diseases thought to be caused by the moon. The King James Version of the Bible records \"lunatick\" in the Gospel of Matthew which has been interpreted as a reference to epilepsy. By the fourth and fifth centuries, astrologers were commonly using the term to refer to neurological and psychiatric diseases.Philosophers such as Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insane individuals with bipolar disorder by providing light during nights which would otherwise have been dark, and affecting susceptible individuals through the well-known route of sleep deprivation. Until at least 1700, it was also a common belief that the moon influenced fevers, rheumatism, episodes of epilepsy and other diseases."}
