It was first published in 1954. It is split in three parts (or volumes), which are named \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", \"The Two Towers\", and \"The Return of the King\". It was written after Hobbit. \n\"The Lord of the Rings\" takes place in Tolkien's fictional world, called Middle-earth. Middle-earth has its own geography, several different races and peoples (elves, dwarves, humans, hobbits, ents), their languages, and a history that is thousands of years old. \nThe plot of \"The Lord of the Rings\" is about the war of the peoples of Middle-earth against a dark lord (who is the 'Lord of the Rings' of the title). At the same time they try to destroy a ring which would give the dark lord a lot of power if he got it, but the only place to destroy the ring is deep into the territory of the enemy. \n\"The Lord of the Rings\" has also been made into films, the most well-known is the film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.\nBook history.\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier fantasy book, \"The Hobbit\", but quickly became a much larger story. He also moved its (and \"The Hobbit\"'s) story into his fictional world Middle-earth, which he had already invented long before he wrote \"The Hobbit\". \nTolkien wrote the story between 1937 and 1949. It was originally published in three parts in the years 1954 and 1955. Since then, \"The Lord of the Rings\" has been translated into 38 languages. It is one of the most popular stories in 20th-century literature and has been an important book for the fantasy genre.\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" is often called a trilogy, because the publisher split the book into three parts because of the book's size. Tolkien himself had sub-divided \"The Lord of the Rings\" into six parts, called Book I-VI, according to the plot. Tolkien never liked it being published in three parts or called a trilogy.\nBackstory.\nThe backstory of \"The Lord of the Rings\" begins thousands of years before the action in the book.\nIn the Second Age, the Dark Lord Sauron wanted to rule Middle-earth. He disguised himself as Annatar, the \"Lord of Gifts\", and pretended to be good. As Annatar he told the elves how to make magical rings which give power to their wearers.\nSauron and the elves together made sixteen rings. The Elves also made three rings by themselves, called Vilya, Nenya and Narya. These nineteen rings were the \"Rings of Power\". But Sauron secretly forged a Great Ring of his own, the \"One Ring\". In this Ring Sauron put half of his power. He planned to control the wearers of the other rings with this One Ring. But the Elves finally realized that Annatar really was the evil Sauron and hid the Rings of Power.\nSauron then started a war. During this war he took back the sixteen rings which he had made together with the Elves. Seven of these rings he gave to the kings of the dwarves, and nine rings he gave to human kings. These human kings became the \"Nazg\u00fbl\", the Ringwraiths, ghostly servants of Sauron. \nLed by Gil-galad and Elendil, the Elves and the Men of Gondor and Arnor formed the \"Last Alliance of Men and Elves\" to fight Sauron. There was a long war and siege of Sauron's fortress Barad-d\u00fbr. In the last battle, Gil-galad and Elendil were killed by Sauron. After his father's death, Elendil' son Isildur cut off the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron was defeated and the war ended. \nBecause half of Sauron's power was in the One Ring, Sauron did not die fully. His spirit still existed as long as the Ring existed. The elves told Isildur to destroy the One Ring, but Isildur did not want to and kept it. \nThe One Ring was lost when Isildur was attacked by Orcs. Isildur tried to escape, but he was killed when he lost the Ring. In the Third Age, the Ring was found by the Stoor hobbit D\u00e9agol, who was killed by his friend Sm\u00e9agol over the Ring. Sm\u00e9agol went to live under the Misty Mountains, where he kept the Ring for five hundred years, and he became known by the name Gollum. \nIn \"The Hobbit\" the Ring is found by the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. He thinks it is an unimportant 'magic ring' that simply makes its wearer invisible. Bilbo keeps it, and brings it back with him to the Shire at the end of his journey. There the One Ring stayed until the beginning of the story of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nThe story.\nThe Fellowship of the Ring.\nBook I.\nThe book begins in the Third Age of Middle-earth, in the Shire, the land of the hobbits. Sixty years after his adventures in the book \"The Hobbit\", Bilbo Baggins is living in the Shire with his adopted cousin Frodo Baggins. But Bilbo wants to make another long journey. After a birthday party for his 111th birthday, and Frodo's 33rd birthday, Bilbo leaves the Shire. His home, Bag End, and the One Ring now belong to Frodo. For another eighteen years nothing happens in Frodo's life. \nIn April of the year 3018, the wizard Gandalf the Grey, who is a friend of Bilbo and Frodo, comes to Bag End. He tells Frodo that his 'magic ring' is really the One Ring of Sauron, and tells him its backstory. Sauron is returning and getting more powerful, because he could not die while the Ring still existed. Sauron is now also searching for the Ring. Gandalf tells Frodo that he has to leave the Shire and take the One Ring to Rivendell, an Elven city. Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's gardener and servant, will go with Frodo. Gandalf promises to meet the two hobbits halfway in the town Bree. Then Gandalf leaves. \nFrodo and Sam prepare to leave the Shire in September 3018. On their way to leave the Shire they are already followed by Sauron's Ringwraiths. Frodo's cousins, Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took also come with them. The four hobbits journey eastwards through the \"Old Forest\", and over the \"Barrow-downs\". They come to Bree, but Gandalf is not there. They meet a man named Strider, and they get a letter from Gandalf. In the letter they are told to go with Strider, who is really named Aragorn. \nThe hobbits continue their journey to Rivendell with Aragorn. On the mountain Weathertop they are attacked by the Ringwraiths, and Frodo is badly wounded by their leader, the Witch-king. Aragorn can defend them, and helps Frodo to stay alive. Along the way they meet the elf Glorfindel. Shortly before Rivendell they are attacked again. Frodo can flee on Glorfindel's horse, followed by the Ringwraiths. Frodo crosses the river Bruinen, beyond which is Rivendell, but the Ringwraiths still follow him. Suddenly the river floods, which carries the Ringwraiths away. Frodo falls unconscious because of the stab wound.\nBook II.\nFrodo wakes up in Rivendell. He has been healed by the elven lord Elrond, and Frodo's friends are also well. Gandalf is in Rivendell, as are messengers from other peoples. Frodo also meets Bilbo again, who has lived in Rivendell for the past years. \nThe next day the \"Council of Elrond\" is held. The messengers of the different peoples all tell the stories why they have come, which are connected to Sauron's doings. Elrond tells them of Sauron and the One Ring. Many other things are told and revealed. Aragorn is the descendant of Isildur. The wizard Saruman has betrayed the free peoples and turned to evil. Also, the One Ring cannot be used by anyone except Sauron. The One Ring turns normal people invisible, but it also corrupts them, makes its wearer power-hungry, and the ring only does evil. \nThe Council decides that the One Ring has to be destroyed, which will also truly kill Sauron forever. But the One Ring can only be destroyed if it is thrown into the volcano Mount Doom in Sauron's land Mordor, where the One Ring was made. \nThe Council sends Frodo, the Ring-bearer, to destroy the Ring, and eight companions to help him. These nine people are the \"Fellowship of the Ring\": the four hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, the two men Aragorn and Boromir, and Gandalf the Grey. \nAt the beginning of the year 3019 the Fellowship begins their long journey. Before they go, Bilbo gives his sword \"Sting\" and his Mithril-armour to Frodo. With Gandalf as their leader, the Fellowship first goes southwards through the land \"Hollin\". They try to go east over the Misty Mountains through the \"Redhorn Pass\", but there is too much snow. The Fellowship decides to go under the mountains, through the old Dwarven mines, which are called Khazad-d\u00fbm or Moria. They almost manage to go through Moria without anything happening, but near the end they are attacked by Orcs. There is also a Balrog, a demonic evil creature from the First Age. Gandalf protects the Fellowship, but he and the Balrog fall into an abyss. Aragorn leads the rest of the Fellowship out of Moria. \nNow east of the Misty Mountains, the remaining Fellowship comes to the forest Lothl\u00f3rien, the land of the Galadhrim, a wood-elven people. The Fellowship is welcomed by Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn, the rulers of Lothl\u00f3rien. The Fellowship stay for a while. \nWhen the Fellowship leaves L\u00f3thl\u00f3rien, the elves give them boats with which they can travel down the river Anduin. Each member of the Fellowship also gets a present from Lady Galadriel. \nThe Fellowship travel down the river Anduin until they reach the Emyn Muil and the waterfall Rauros. There they stop to decide where to go now: south to Boromir's home city Minas Tirith, or east to Mordor. Frodo goes for a walk to help him decide. He meets Boromir, who says that the Fellowship should go to Minas Tirith. Boromir also begins to talk about using the Ring against Sauron. Frodo realizes that Boromir is influenced by the One Ring. Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but Frodo puts the Ring on, becomes invisible and escapes. Boromir becomes himself again and is very sorry for what he tried to do. \nFrodo decides that he will go alone to Mordor, so that the Ring cannot influence or hurt anyone else. The rest of the Fellowship are worrying where Frodo is. When Boromir comes and tells them that Frodo has run away, all of the Fellowship go and search for him. \nSam thinks about the situation, and realizes that Frodo wants to go to Mordor alone. Sam runs back to the boats, and catches Frodo leaving. In the end Frodo and Sam go east to Mordor together, to destroy the One Ring, and hoping that their friends in the Fellowship will be well.\nThe Two Towers.\nBook III.\nThe book begins with Aragorn, who finds a dying Boromir. Boromir tells him that they were attacked by Orcs, who took Merry and Pippin with them. Boromir says he is sorry for everything and dies. Legolas and Gimli arrive. As a funeral, the three put Boromir's body in one of their boats, which they let fall down the waterfall Rauros. They find out that Frodo and Sam left them to go to Mordor, and that the Orcs that attacked them were Saruman's Orcs, who have taken Merry and Pippin. They decide to follow the Orcs westwards to save Merry and Pippin. West of the Emyn Muil they come into the land Rohan, home of the Rohirrim, the \"Horse-lords\". They meet a group of Rohirrim led by \u00c9omer, nephew of King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan. \u00c9omer and his men have killed the Orc group on the border of the forest Fangorn, but did not see Merry or Pippin. \u00c9omer gives them two horses, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to the Fangorn forest. \nMerry and Pippin were caught and taken away by a group of Saruman's Orcs, the Uruk-hai. When the Orcs are surrounded and killed by the Rohirrim group, the two hobbits escape into the Fangorn Forest. There they meet Treebeard, an \"Ent\". Ents are giant tree-like creatures. Treebeard takes the hobbits with him, and they tell him what happens in the world outside Fangorn. The Ents have a meeting called the \"Entmoot\". During the \"Entmoot\", the Ents decide to fight Saruman. Treebeard, the other Ents, and the two hobbits go to Isengard, Saruman's home.\nIn Fangorn, Aragon, Legolas and Gimli meet Gandalf. He had died, but was sent back to Middle-earth as Gandalf the White, to further help the fight against Sauron. Gandalf tells them that Merry and Pippin are well. They then go to Edoras, the capital of Rohan. Gandalf tells King Th\u00e9oden that they have to go to war against Saruman. Gr\u00edma Wormtongue, a spy and servant of Saruman, is cast out. The people of Edoras, led by \u00c9omer's sister \u00c9owyn, flee to Dunharrow in the White Mountains, while the army of the Rohirrim goes to their fortress at Helm's Deep. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go with the Rohirrim warriors, but Gandalf leaves once more without notice. Saruman sends his army of ten thousand Uruk-hai, Orcs, and Dunland men to Helm's Deep. The next morning Gandalf arrives with another Rohirrim army. They defeat Saruman's army, and win the \"Battle of the Hornburg\". \nGandalf, his friends, and a small group of Rohirrim then go to Isengard, Saruman's home. But when they arrive it has already been destroyed by the Ents. They also meet Merry and Pippin there. They talk to Saruman, who still hides in his indestructible tower Orthanc. Gandalf cast him from the Order of Wizards. They find the palant\u00edr, which was thrown from the tower by Gr\u00edma. The Palant\u00edri are magical black stones with which one can see far away things, and communicate with other palant\u00edri. The group leaves Isengard and rests. Pippin steals the palant\u00edr and looks in, and because of this is discovered by Sauron. The group flees the place before the Nazg\u00fbl find them. Gandalf and Pippin go to Minas Tirith, while the Rohirrim and other members of the Fellowship go back to Helm's Deep.\nBook IV.\nFrodo and Sam are in the Emyn Muil mountains and journey eastwards to Mordor. While they are still in the Emyn Muil, they are attacked by Gollum. But the hobbits can defeat and catch him. Gollum has to promise to show them the way into Mordor. They go through the Dead Marshes and come to the Morannon, the Black Gate of Mordor. They cannot go in, but Gollum says he knows a secret way into Mordor. \nFrodo, Sam, and Gollum travel south through Ithilien. There they see a battle between a group of Southrons from Harad and a group of Rangers of Gondor. The hobbits are caught by the Gondorian group, which is led by Faramir, who is Boromir's brother. But the next day Faramir lets the hobbits leave, because he also believes that the One Ring has to be destroyed. \nGollum leads the hobbits into Cirith Ungol in the Mountains of Shadow, but leaves the hobbits there alone. They are hunted by Shelob, a giant spider living in these tunnels. After almost escaping, Shelob stings Frodo, but is wounded and driven off by Sam. Sam believes Frodo is dead, and takes the Ring to continue the quest and destroy it. Frodo's body is found and taken away by a group of Orcs. Sam follows them. The leaders of the Orc group are talking, and Sam hears them say that Frodo is paralyzed, but still alive.\nThe Return of the King.\nBook V.\nGandalf and Pippin arrive in Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. There they meet Denethor II, Steward of Gondor, and father of Boromir and Faramir. Pippin becomes a member of the \"Guards of the Citadel\". Minas Tirith prepares for war. \nThe Rohirrim and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Merry are on their way to Helm's Deep. Along the way they meet the \"Grey Company\" coming from Rivendell. It is a group of thirty D\u00fanedain, which are Aragorn's people. With the group are also Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. Aragorn uses the palant\u00edr. Aragorn decides to take to the \"Paths of the Dead\". Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and the Grey Company go to Edoras, Dunharrow, and through the \"Paths of the Dead\" through the White Mountains. There Aragorn calls an army of dead spirits to help him. The Grey Company and the \"Dead Men of Dunharrow\" then go east.\nThe Rohirrim and Merry come to Dunharrow. King Th\u00e9oden takes the Rohirrim armies and goes to help Gondor in the war. Merry is not allowed to go with them, but he secretly goes with a warrior named Dernhelm. \nIn Minas Tirith they meet Faramir, who tells them of his meeting with Frodo. The next day Faramir goes off to defend the old city Osgiliath, but the city falls, and so do the outer defenses of Minas Tirith. During the retreat Faramir is badly wounded. Minas Tirith is besieged by the armies of Mordor, led by the Witch-king, the leader of the Nazg\u00fbl who (it was said) could not be killed by any man. Denethor goes insane and burns himself, and almost also kills the injured Faramir, but this is prevented by Pippin and Gandalf. \nThe Rohirrim arrive. The armies of Gondor and Rohan fight the armies of Mordor in the \"Battle of the Pelennor Fields\". There, King Th\u00e9oden is killed. Dernhelm, who was really \u00c9owyn (a woman), kills the Witch-king with Merry's help. Aragorn comes with a fleet of black ships and another army of men from southern Gondor up the river Anduin. Together they win the \"Battle of the Pelennor Fields\".\nAragorn heals the wounded and sick Faramir, \u00c9owyn, Merry, and many others, proving that he is the rightful King of Gondor. Legolas and Gimli go into Minas Tirith and meet Merry and Pippin again. There they also tell how they got the black ships with the help of the Army of the Dead. The leaders of the armies of Men decide to attack Mordor, as a distraction so that Frodo can destroy the One Ring. Aragorn and Gandalf lead an army of 7000 men to the Black Gate of Mordor. There they fight the \"Battle of the Morannon\" against the overwhelmingly large army of Sauron. During the battle Pippin falls unconscious, but he hears that the Great Eagles have come to help them.\nBook VI.\nSamwise comes to the Tower of Cirith Ungol, but the different Orc groups in it had a fight and almost all of them are now dead. Sam frees Frodo and gives him back the One Ring. The two hobbits disguise themselves as orcs, escape from the Tower and continue their journey through Mordor. It is a hard journey, and the Ring's influence on Frodo is very strong now. One time the hobbits are forced to walk with an army of orcs, but they can escape without being discovered.\nThe hobbits come to Mount Doom, where they are attacked by Gollum, who still wants the One Ring. Frodo goes on alone into Mount Doom, but Sam has pity for Gollum and lets him live. Sam follows Frodo into Mount Doom. Frodo is finally overpowered by the One Ring, says it belongs to him and puts the Ring on, which makes Sauron know that he and the Ring are there. Gollum comes back once more and fights with Frodo. Gollum bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring. Gollum is happy to have his Ring back, but makes a mistake: Gollum and the One Ring fall into the volcano, and the Ring is destroyed. Sauron fully dies and his fortress Barad-d\u00fbr is destroyed. \nAt the \"Battle of the Morannon\", the Orcs and other evil creatures no longer know what to do and are defeated easily, and the Battle is won. Gandalf calls three of the Eagles, who then rescue Frodo and Sam.\nThey all return to Minas Tirith. Aragorn becomes King of Gondor and Arnor. Elves from Rivendell and Lothl\u00f3rien come to Minas Tirith. Aragon marries Arwen Und\u00f3miel, daughter of Elrond. The Fellowship, the elves, and the Rohirrim go back to Rohan. King Th\u00e9oden is buried. \u00c9omer officially becomes King of Rohan, and \u00c9owyn and Faramir are married. They go on to Helm's Deep, were the fellowship finally splits. Aragorn goes back to Minas Tirith, and Legolas and Gimli also leave to travel to their homes in the northeast. The elves, hobbits and Gandalf go on. At Isedgard they are told that Saruman has left. Galadriel and the Lothl\u00f3rien-elves leave the group to go back home east over the mountains. The others come to Rivendell, where the hobbits meet Bilbo again. \nThe four hobbits and Gandalf leave Rivendell, to travel back to the Shire. Gandalf leaves the hobbits after Bree. The four hobbits come to the Shire, but Saruman with his men has taken over the land. Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin lead the other hobbits in the fight against them, and they free themselves and the Shire. After a battle, the four hobbits find Saruman and Gr\u00edma at Bag End. Frodo wants to send them away unhurt, but Saruman is killed by Gr\u00edma. Gr\u00edma is shot by hobbit archers. \nSome years later Frodo and Sam go to meet Bilbo, Elrond, and Galadriel, and some other elves. They all go to the Grey Havens, where they meet Gandalf, and also Merry and Pippin. The Ring-bearers Bilbo and Frodo, together with Gandalf and the elves, leave Middle-earth, and go west across the sea to Valinor. The Fourth Age of Middle-earth begins. The three remaining hobbits go back to the Shire, and Sam returns to his wife and child.\nAdaptations.\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" has been adapted, or made into a movie, a musical, a radio play, and has been made into an animated and three live-action films. Most known is probably \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy (2001\u20132003) directed by Peter Jackson."}
{"id": "11143", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11143", "title": "Extinction", "text": "Extinction is when a species of animal, plant, or other organisms are no longer living. Extinction is one of the major features of evolution.\nAll species become extinct sooner or later. The end of a species may happen for many reasons. It may be caused by habitat loss or by being overhunted, or by a major extinction event. An example of an animal that is now extinct is the Dodo, from over-hunting. Another quite different way for a species to end is by species-splitting, known as cladogenesis. The species living today probably were not living in the Cambrian period, but their ancestors were.\nNotable extinct animal species include the non-avian dinosaurs, the saber-toothed cats, the dodo, the mammoths, ground sloths, the thylacine, the trilobites and the golden toad.\nEndangered species are those which may become extinct. A report from Kew Gardens suggests that one fifth of plant species may be at risk of extinction. Fossil species sometimes reappear millions of years after they were thought to be extinct. These cases are called Lazarus taxa. Humans are to blame due to cutting down animals\u2019 natural habitat such as forests.\nDuration of species.\nThe average duration of species varies according to the groups studied. A study of benthic (deep water) foraminifera showed an average of 16 million years if they lived above 200 metres, but 25my if they lived below 200 metres. On the other hand, the average survival time for mammalian species over the past 20my has been 2.33my.\nIt is estimated that 99.9% of all species that have ever lived are now extinct. More than half of the plants and animals that have become extinct in the last 200 years have been in Australia. There the arrival of Europeans with (accidentally or deliberately) introduced species has damaged the native biota. Especially, the introduction of eutherian mammals has caused the extinction of many marsupial forms.\nDuration of higher groups.\nNaturally, higher categories such as genera, families, orders, classes and phyla last longer, because they are composed of more species. As far as we know, no phylum has gone completely extinct since the Cambrian, but quite a few classes went extinct in one or other of the 'big five' extinction events. Examples of higher categories of animal now extinct are: placoderm fish, trilobites, ammonites, pelycosaurs, non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs.\nReasons.\nDarwin thought that most extinctions occurred because some organisms became more effective, and replaced their less advanced competitors. No doubt that does occur, but the view now is that environmental change is more important. Organisms become adapted to the environments they live in. The environment certainly does change, and sometimes quite dramatically. When it does, some organisms can adapt to the changes. Others cannot.\nThe Earth's environment can stay rather stable for long periods of time. Then the rate of extinction is usually quite low. Then changes occur, sometimes quite rapidly. In these times the rate of extinction can be much higher. The rate of extinction is therefore a useful thing to measure."}

It is also one of the most populous and polluted cities in the world. The Aztec people were here before the Spanish came and made Mexico City. It was founded in 1521 by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Today, about 8.5 million people live in the city, and about 18 million live in the Greater Mexico City urban area. The city of Mexico City ceased to exist in 1928. Since then, there is only the Federal District.\nMexico City has 18.1 million people. It is the city with the second highest number of people in the world after Tokyo in Japan and just slightly more populated than Mumbai in India.\nHistory.\nMexico City was first built in the 1520s after Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s destroyed the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. The Spaniards then emptied the basin of Lake Texcoco to keep it from flooding. By the late 1700s, Mexico City had over 100,000 people. However, there were many slums, which caused epidemics. There were political problems in the mid 1800s after Mexico became independent. More than 40 people ruled in the 40 years after the country became independent. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, electric light and gas were brought to the city. But there was a big difference between the rich western part of the city and the poor eastern part of the city. By 1930, Mexico City had 1,000,000 people. The city kept growing quickly. In 1968, the Olympic Games were in Mexico City. In 1985, an earthquake hit the capital. In the past few decades, there have been problems with crime and corruption.\nEnvironment.\nMexico City has a high population density. It is also surrounded by mountains. This causes problems with air pollution.\nSometimes Mexico City gets earthquakes.\nGeography.\nMexico City is in the Valley of Mexico at around 2,300 meters (7,800 feet) above sea level.\nMexico City its divided by 16 boroughs: \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n, Azcapotzalco, Benito Juarez, Coyoac\u00e1n, Cuajimalpa, Cuauht\u00e9moc, Gustavo A. Madero, Iztacalco, Iztapalapa, Magdalena Contreras, Miguel Hidalgo, Milpa Alta, Tl\u00e1huac, Tlalpan, Venustiano Carranza and Xochimilco.\nMexico City was originally built on a lake, Lake Texcoco, which is now mostly drained. The ecology of the area has been much changed by the draining. Many of its native species, such as the Axolotl, are extinct, or endangered.\nThe mountains Popocat\u00e9petl and Iztacc\u00edhuatl are nearby.\nClimate.\nMexico City is in the tropics. But because its elevation is so high, it has a subtropical highland climate (\"Cwb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). This means temperatures are warm or mild year-round. It is a lot wetter in the summer than in the winter. Some parts of the city get frost in the winter."}

There the surface molecules can draw heat energy from the surroundings, which makes the molecules heat up faster and escape faster. This process is also known as evaporation. For example, a bowl filled with water will evaporate much faster than a flask filled with the same amount."}

However, Chicago makes up over half of the state\u00b4s population, and Cook County (in which Chicago is located) gave Trump just 21% of the vote there. Therefore, the governor of Illinois is currently a Democrat, as are both its US Senators and over 70% of its representatives. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the state by 17%. In 2012, Barack Obama won the state by 17%. In 2008, Obama won the state by over 25%.

New Zealand pays for a ship, which connects Tokelau with the next bigger seaport (Apia, on Samoa). The trip from Apia to Fakaofo takes about a day, reaching the northernmost atoll Atafu will take another three to four hours. There is no large pier on any of the islands, which means that smaller boats (called barges) are needed to reach the shore. The ship reaches Tokelau about once every two weeks.\nIn 2004 there was a vote to change the status of Tokelau: Rather than being a dependent territory of New Zealand, the proposal was to be \"in association with\" New Zealand, much like Cook Islands and Niue. At the time, the people of Tokelau voted against this independence."}

The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola. Its capital city is Kingston; other towns include Montego Bay, St. Ann's Bay and Spanish Town. The island is divided into three counties \u2013 Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey \u2013 which are subdivided into 14 parishes: Kingston, St. Andrew, St. Catherine, Clarendon, Manchester, St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, Hanover, St. James, Trelawny, St. Ann, St. Mary, Portland and St. Thomas.\nJamaica is the third-largest island country in the Greater Antilles. Its Ta\u00edno name is \"Xaymaca\", meaning \"Land of Springs\". Jamaica is part of the West Indies.\nHistory of Jamaica.\nThe Taino indigenous people, originating in South America, settled on the island between 4000 and 1000\u00a0BC. When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1494, there were more than 200 villages ruled by \"caciques\" (chiefs of villages). The south coast of Jamaica was the most populated, especially around the area now known as Old Harbour.\nChristopher Columbus, during his second voyage to the Americas, claimed Jamaica for Spain after landing there on 5 May 1494 and his probable landing point was Dry Harbour, now called Discovery Bay. There is some debate as to whether he landed in St. Ann's Bay or in Discovery Bay. St. Ann's Bay was named \"Saint Gloria\" by Columbus, as the first sighting of the land.\nIn 1503, during his fourth voyage, Columbus had to spend one year on the northern coast of the island, and he named the island \"Isla de Santiago\" (by Sant Iago Apostol, in Spanish \"Santiago\").\nIn 1509, the new Governor of the Hispaniola, Diego Columbus, sent Juan de Esquivel, a Conquistador born in Seville, Spain, with 70 men to Jamaica to complete the conquest of that island. They first lived in the St. Ann's Bay area and soon Esquivel founded a town, \"Sevilla La Nueva\" (in English, \"The New Seville\") on the north coast, one mile to the west of St. Ann's Bay.\nSevilla was abandoned around 1524 because it was deemed unhealthy. The capital was moved to Spanish Town, then called \"Saint Jago de la Vega\", in the south around 1534.\nBritish rule.\nIn 1654 Oliver Cromwell decided to break the Spanish control of the West Indies and he sent a fleet in an expedition) led by William Penn and General Robert Venables. The fleet arrived to the Santo Domingo island on 13 April 1655 but the British lost in two battles on 17 and 25 April and they decided to move to Jamaica.\nOn 10 May 1655, Penn and Venables led a successful attack on Jamaica. The Spanish surrendered to the English, freed their slaves and then fled to Cuba. It was this set of freed slaves and their descendants living in the Jamaican mountains who became known as the Maroons.\nIndependence.\nAfter a long period of direct British colonial rule, Jamaica gained a degree of local political control in the late 1930s, and held its first election under full universal adult suffrage in 1944. Jamaica joined nine other U.K. territories in the West Indies Federation in 1958 but withdrew after Jamaican voters rejected membership in 1961. Jamaica got its independence in 1962, remaining a member of the Commonwealth.\nGovernment and politics.\nJamaica is a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II serving as the monarch. However, as Elizabeth II is shared as head of state of fifteen other countries (the Commonwealth realm) in addition to the UK and resides mostly in the United Kingdom, she is thus often represented as Queen of Jamaica in Jamaica and abroad by the Governor-General of Jamaica. The governor-general is nominated by the Prime Minister of Jamaica and appointed by the monarch. All the members of the Cabinet are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The monarch and the governor-general serve largely ceremonial roles.\nThe Parliament of Jamaica is bicameral. This means that it consists of two Houses, the Senate, also called the Upper House, and the House of Representatives, also known as the Lower House. The members of the House (known as Members of Parliament or \"MPs\") are elected by the people of Jamaica. The leader of the political party with most members in the House of Representatives is appointed by the governor-general to be the prime minister. Senators are nominated jointly by the prime minister and the parliamentary leader of the opposition and are then appointed by the governor-general.\nTarch 2016. Prime Minister Holness acts as head of government of Jamaica.\nJamaica has traditionally had a system of two parties, with power often alternating between the People's National Party and Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The party with current administrative and legislative power is Jamaica Labour Party, with a two-thirds Parliamentary majority as of 2016.\nParishes.\nJamaica is divided into 14 parishes, which are grouped into three historic counties that have no administrative relevance.\nPopulation.\nDemographics.\nIn 2011 (last national census), there were 2,697,983 people living in Jamaica: 1,334,533 men and 1,363,450 women.

Its official name is the Republic of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is the ninth biggest country in the world, and it is also the biggest landlocked country in the world. Before the end of the Soviet Union, it was called \"Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic\". The president of the country from 1991 through March 2019 was Nursultan Nazarbayev. Nur-Sultan is the capital city of Kazakhstan. Almaty was the capital until 1998, when it moved to Nur-Sultan, which was called Astana at that time.\nThe Kazakh language which is a Turkic language is the native language, but Russian has equal official status for all administrative and institutional purposes. Islam is the largest religion- about 70% of the population are Muslims, with Christianity practiced by 26%; Russia leases (rents) the land for the Baikonur Cosmodrome (site of Russian spacecraft launches) from Kazakhstan.\nGeography.\nKazakhstan is a transcontinental country mostly in Asia with a small western part across the Ural River in Europe. It has borders with the Russian Federation in the north and west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the southwest, and China in the far east. The northern border is mostly with Siberia, Russia, so Russia has the longest border with Kazakhstan. Basically, Kazakhstan runs from the Caspian Sea in the west to the mainly Muslim Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang.\nKazakhstan has no ocean shoreline, but borders the Caspian Sea, which boats use to get to neighboring countries. The Caspian Sea is an Endorheic basin without connections to any ocean.\nNatural resources.\nKazakhstan has plenty of petroleum, natural gas, and mining. It attracted over $40 billion in foreign investment since 1993 and accounts for some 57% of the nation's industrial output. According to some estimates, Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium, chromium, lead, and zinc reserves, the third largest manganese reserves, the fifth largest copper reserves, and ranks in the top ten for coal, iron, and gold. It is also an exporter of diamonds. Kazakhstan has the 11th largest proven reserves of both petroleum and natural gas.\nRegions.\nKazakhstan is divided into 14 regions. They are divided into districts.\nAlmaty and Nur-Sultan cities have the status of State importance and are not in any region. Baikonur city has a special status because it is leased to Russia for Baikonur cosmodrome until 2050.\nEach province is headed by an Akim (provincial governor) appointed by the president. Municipal Akims are appointed by province Akims. The Government of Kazakhstan moved its capital from Almaty to Nur-Sultan on December 10, 1997.\nPopulation.\nThe population of Kazakhstan is 17,165,000. It takes the 62th place in the List of countries by population. Average density is one of the lowest on earth with almost 6 people/km2 ( List of countries by population density).\nReferences.\nNotes"}

A sign may be natural or man-made.\nA natural sign shows something significant. Leaves turn brown and fall off deciduous trees in the autumn. Temperatures drop, daylight hours shorten. It suggests winter is coming. Many birds migrate and some mammals hibernate in response to natural signs like these. Humans, as usual, are a bit different. They make their own signs.\nA man-made sign is called a signal or symbol. It is an artificial thing, which people decide means something in their society. For example, the stop sign on the road tells the person that they must stop their car there. So does a red traffic light. They are signals with a legal meaning, and people learn what these meanings are.\nSometimes a person may not know what a sign means. Feeling a cold wind could be a sign that someone left a door or window open.\nIn medicine, a sign is something seen, whereas a symptom is something felt, like a pain. A sign might be something like high blood pressure, which can be measured. \nRoad signs.\nA road sign or traffic sign is something that gives information by means of a symbol, or in only 1 or 2 words. It helps people in their vehicles on the road. Some signs include: Give way, Stop, Keep left, No U-turn, no parking, Zebra crossing and much more. Signs are very useful. Without signs and traffic lights there would be many accidents and arguments on the road."}

It is about 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) east of Naples. It is the only volcano on the mainland of Europe that erupted in the last 100 years. The last major eruption was in 1944. Two other important active volcanos in Italy are on islands. They are Etna and Stromboli.\nMount Vesuvius is best known for its eruption in A.D. 79 which destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. They were never built again. The towns were buried in ash so completely that later people who lived there forgot about them until they were accidentally discovered in the late 18th century.\nThe eruption also changed the way the Sarno River flowed, and raised the sea beach. Because of this, Pompeii was not on the river nor next to the coast anymore. Mount Vesuvius was also greatly changed. Many of the plants there died, and the top of the mountain looked different because of the strong eruption.\nVesuvius has erupted many times after that. Today, it is one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because 3,000,000\u00a0people live near this explosive volcano. More people live near Mount Vesuvius than any other volcano in the world.\nVesuvius has a long tradition of history and literature. A serpent (snake) called \"Vesuvius\" has been used in frescos of many \"lararia\" (household temples) from Pompeii. In Capua, the words \"IOVI VESVVIO\" (\"Jupiter Vesuvius\") show that he was worshipped as a power of Jupiter.\nThe historian Diodorus Siculus said that there was a story that Hercules once passed through the country of Cumae when he was going to Sicily. There, he found a place called \"the Phlegraean Plain\" (\"phlegraion pedion\", \"plain of fire\"). It said that it was \"from a hill which anciently (from a long time ago) vomited out called Vesuvius.\" Giant \"sons of the Earth\" lived inside it. With the help of the gods, he helped the people there and went on. An ode by Martial in AD 88 suggests that Venus and Hercules were worshipped in the place that was destroyed by the eruption in AD 79.\nName.\nThe volcano was often called \"Vesuvius\" in the late Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. It was also called \"Vesaevus, Vesevus, Vesbius\", and \"Vesvius\". Writers in ancient Greek called it \"\u039f\u1f50\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\" or \"\u039f\u1f50\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\". Many scholars think the word \"Vesuvius\" was related to the Greek word \"\u03bf\u1f54\" (\"not\") and \u03c3\u03b2\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9 (\"I quench\"), so that it would mean \"unquenchable\". Others think it might come from \u1f15\u03c9 \"hurl\" and \u03b2\u03af\u03b7 \"violence\", \"hurling violence\". \nAppearance.\nVesuvius has a large cone (\"Gran Cono\") which is partly surrounded by the top of a caldera which was made when an earlier and much higher structure called Monte Somma collapsed. The Gran Cono was made during the eruption of AD 79. For this reason, the volcano is also called Somma-Vesuvius or Somma-Vesuvio.\nEruption of 79 AD.\nBefore Mount Vesuvius exploded in 79B.C.E people who lived nearby did not even know that it was a volcano, because it had not erupted for 600 years. At about 1 PM, on August 24, AD 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted violently. It showered ash and pumice on the town of Pompeii, which was 5 miles away.\nToday, people think the eruption of 79 AD lasted more than 19 hours. It was noticed by Pliny the Younger who described the mushroom cloud from the volcano as being in the shape of umbrella pine, a tree commonly found in the region. Pliny the Younger was the only person to write the story down.\nThere were many ways that people died. One was that the smoke that they breathed in was deadly because it dried in their lungs and formed glass. They also were buried by powdery ash from the volcano, which was all over them. Over time this ash turned to a sort of rock, protecting the bodies and the city from the weather and from robbers.\nVesuvius erupted 50 more times after the eruption in 79 AD. Vesuvius was named a national park in 1995."}

There are many different types of minerals. Some are hard, like diamonds. Some are soft, like talc. Some are metal, like gold or silver. Minerals are put into special groups of minerals made of similar chemicals, or that have similar structures inside. For example, the chemicals that make up some minerals line up in chains, while in other minerals, they make bow-tie shapes. \nStudying minerals can be useful for figuring out certain things about a rock. Sometimes the shape or size of the mineral can tell something about the rock as well. For example, minerals in igneous rocks can help figure out how long the rock took to cool down (turn from lava into a rock). Larger minerals mean the rock cooled slowly (probably underground). Smaller minerals mean the rock cooled down quickly (probably above ground, like from a volcano). The type of mineral in a rock can also tell what kind of a rock it is, or what has happened to the rock since it formed. Many rocks are named based on what kinds of minerals they have.\nMineralogists (people who study minerals) study minerals in rocks with hand lenses (a magnifying glass), and in thin section (thin slices of rock) with microscopes. They record things about the minerals like how big they are, what shape they are, what color they are, and if the mineral changes colors when you turn it. Mineralogists also record what color minerals turn in a special light. These details can help mineralogists figure out what minerals they are looking at. \nMinerals can be used in a lot of different things, like mining, jewelry, farming, pottery, making metals, and more . Mineralogists can help find important minerals in the Earth using what they know and learn."}

{"id": "11242", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11242", "title": "Supermarket", "text": "A supermarket, grocery store (or just grocery) is a retail store that sells food. Most grocery stores sell fresh fruit, vegetables, seafood, meat, and other prepared foods.\nThe person who controls a grocery store is called a grocer. A grocer will order food from farmers or other people who send out farmers food to other grocery stores and restaurants.\nTypes of grocery stores.\nThere are a range of different types and sizes of grocery stores. Some grocery stores are small community stores with a limited range of items. Other grocery stores are large stores with a vast selection of food items.\nThey may also sell household cleaning and laundry supplies, and hygiene items (soap, toothpaste, etc.). They may also contain a pharmacy (known as a drug store or chemist in some places).\nItems at a grocery store can be sold in one of two ways. Most fruits, vegetables, meat, and seafood are usually sold by weight (for example, apples cost 99 cents per pound), while other items are usually sold by quantity (for example, table salt costs $1.59 for each box). Not all items are the same price at each grocery store. Also, every week, some items at grocery stores cost less that what it normally would cost (we say that these items are \"on sale\"), so people would want to go buy them since they don't have to pay as much as they would normally have to get that item. Many grocery stores print a flyer that shows which items are on sale that week. These flyers are then sent to other people in the mail, who would read the flyer and go to the store to buy the items shown in it.\nSupermarkets.\nSupermarkets are large grocery stores that sell a large variety of fresh and packaged food and other consumer or household products. Supermarkets are divided into sections, such as bakery, dairy, produce (fruits and vegetables), frozen, meat, and deli, along with a \"general grocery\" section where one can find packaged goods, cleaning supplies, and personal hygiene items. Many supermarkets today now also sell hot, prepared food that is ready to eat, or contains a food court with different fast food shops. The term \"supermarket\" usually refers to a larger store than the term \"grocery store.\"\nHypermarkets.\nA hypermarket is a very large supermarket that is part of a larger general merchandise store such as Walmart, which also sells clothes, electronics, household hardware, and other items. It can be said to be a hybrid (or combination) of a grocery store and a department store. These stores are mainly found in suburbs where there is a lot of room to build and near where people live.\nHow to shop at a grocery store.\nIn the past, grocery stores used to be small. The owner, called a shopkeeper, would ask the customer what he or she would like to buy. The shopkeeper would then get the items, bring it to the customer, and put them in bags which the customer would take with them. He would then calculate how much the customer has to pay, and take the money from the customer. The customer then takes the bags of items out of the store by him/herself.\nToday, most groceries stores are too big for one person to take care of. Because of this, the customer has to find the items he or she wants by him/herself. Most often, the customer would take a shopping basket or shopping cart and put the items he or she wants to buy into the basket or cart. For some items, like meat and seafood, the customer still has to have an employee get or prepare the item. Once the customer is done shopping, he or she then brings the items to the \"checkout\", where a person called a cashier scans the customer's items into a cash register (or a computer as part of a point of sale system) and then takes the customer's payment. Supermarkets typically accept payment by cash, debit cards, and/or credit cards. Recently, there are so-called self-checkout systems where the customer scans the items on his or her own.\nMany large supermarkets also have a loyalty program, where a customer can earn points by purchasing products. When a customer has enough points, a discount or reward is given. These programs are meant to make customers come back to the same store again and again."}

About 27% of the people live below the national poverty line.\nThe official language is Spanish. Many other indigenous languages are spoken. Most of the people in Ecuador are Roman Catholics, although Ecuador has religious freedom and people can follow any religion they choose.\nProvinces.\nEcuador is divided into 24 provinces. Each has its own administrative capital.\nThe provinces are divided into cantons. The cantons are divided into parishes.\nHistoric Center of Quito.\nThe Historic Center of Quito, Ecuador is one of the largest, least-altered and best-preserved historic centers in the Americas. This center was, together with the historic centre of Krak\u00f3w in Poland, the first to be declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 18 September 1978. The Historic Centre of Quito is in the center south of the capital on an area of 320\u00a0hectares (790\u00a0acres), and is considered one of the most important historic areas in Latin America.There are about 130 monumental buildings (which hosts a variety of pictorial art and sculpture, mostly of religious inspired in a multi-faceted range of schools and styles) and 5,000 properties registered in the municipal inventory of heritage properties.\nPresidential Palace.\nCarondelet Palace (Spanish: Palacio de Carondelet) is the seat of government of the Republic of Ecuador in the historical center of Quito. Axis is the nerve of the public space known as Independence Square or Plaza Grande (colonial name), around which were built in addition the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace, the Hotel Plaza Grande and the Metropolitan Cathedral. The history of this emblematic building dating back to colonial times, around 1570, with the acquisition of the former royal houses in the city of Quito\nDuring the Republican era, almost all the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have dispatched from this building, which is the seat of Government of the Republic of Ecuador. In addition to the administrative units in the third level of the Palace is the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which they live the President and his family. Rafael Correa, president since 2007, considering that Carondelet Palace and its agencies are Ecuadoran heritages, converted the presidential compound into a museum accessible to all who wish to visit it. To this end, areas were organized to locate objects within their cultural contexts to make them accessible to the world. Several rooms and spaces within the palace are used for this purpose.\nChurch of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas.\nConstruction began in 1605, with Mastrilli laying the first stone. The building was not completed until 1765. La Compa\u00f1\u00eda is among the best-known churches in Quito because of its large central nave, which is profusely decorated with gold leaf, gilded plaster and wood carvings. Inspired by two Roman Jesuit churches\u2014the Chiesa del Ges\u00f9 and the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola\u2014La Compa\u00f1\u00eda is one of the most significant works of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America.\nIndependence Square.\nAlso known as Big Square (Spanish: Plaza de la Independencia, Plaza Grande). Historic public square of Quito (Ecuador), in the heart of the old city. This is the central square of the city and one of the symbols of the executive power of the nation. Its main feature is the monument to the independence heroes of August 10, 1809, date remembered as the First Cry of Independence of the Royal Audience of Quito from Spanish monarchy. The environment of the square is flanked by the Carondelet Palace, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace and the Plaza Grande Hotel.\nChurch of San Fransisco.\nThe \"Iglesia y Monasterio de San Francisco\" (English: Church and Monastery of St. Francis), colloquially known as El San Francisco, is a colonial-styled church and monastery in Quito, Ecuador. Construction of the building began a few weeks after the founding of the city in 1534 and ended in 1604. The founder of the church was Franciscan missionary Jodoco Ricke.\nThe building's construction began around 1550, sixteen years after Quito was founded by Spanish conquistadors, and was finished in approximately 1680. The building was officially inaugurated in 1605. It is not known who designed the original plans for the complex, though the most-accepted theory is that they were sent from Spain, based on the topographical study of Ricke and Gosseal. It is also possible that architects came from Spain for the construction of the monastery, or that Ricke and Gosseal managed the entire construction.\nChurch of El Sagrario.\nIn colonial times, the Church of El Sagrario was one of the largest architectural marvels of Quito. The construction is of the Italian Renaissance style and was built in the late 17th century. It has a screen that supports its sculptures and decorations. This structure was built by Bernardo de Legarda. Its central arch leads to a dome decorated with frescoes of biblical scenes featuring archangels, work by Francisco Alb\u00e1n. The altarpiece was gilded by Legarda. It is on Calle Garc\u00eda Moreno, near the Cathedral.\nChurch of Santo Domingo.\nAlthough they arrived in Quito in 1541, in 1580 the Dominicans started to build their temple, using the plans and direction of Francisco Becerra. The work was completed in the first half of the 17th century. Inside the church are valuable structures, such as the neo-Gothic main altar. This was placed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mud\u00e9jar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is composed of a pair and knuckle frame, coated inside by pieces of tracery. In the museum on the north side of the lower cloister are wonderful pieces of great Quito sculptors such as the Saint Dominic de Guzm\u00e1n by Father Carlos, the Saint John of God by Caspicara, and the Saint Thomas Aquinas by Legarda. Another Baroque piece that stands is the Chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario, which is a recognizable feature of the architecture of Quito. This chapel was built beside the church, in the gospel side. In this was founded the largest fraternity in the city of Quito.\nEl Panecillo.\nEl Panecillo is a hill in the middle west of the city at an altitude of about 3,016\u00a0metres (9,895\u00a0ft) above sea level. A monument to the Virgin Mary is on top of El Panecillo and is visible from most of the city of Quito. In 1976, the Spanish artist Agust\u00edn de la Herr\u00e1n Matorras was commissioned by the religious order of the Oblates to build a 41\u00a0metres (135\u00a0ft)\u2013tall aluminum monument of a madonna, which was assembled on a high pedestal on the top of Panecillo.\nThe Quito School.\nThe Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest Jodoco Ricke, who together with Friar Pedro Gocial transformed the San Andr\u00e9s seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of miscegenation (\"mestizaje\") and of syncretism, in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.\nThe Quito School (\"Escuela Quite\u00f1a\") is an artistic tradition that developed in the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito, from Pasto and Popay\u00e1n in the north to Piura and Cajamarca in the south, during the colonial period (1542-1824). This artistic production was one of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito.\nThe major artists of the Quito School are the sculptors Bernardo de Legarda , Manuel Chili (Caspicara) and Miguel Angel Tejada Zambrado and the painters Fray Pedro Gosseal, Fray Pedro Bed\u00f3n, Nicol\u00e1s Javier Gor\u00edbar, Hernando de la Cruz, Miguel de Santiago, Manuel de Samaniego\nBasilica del Voto Nacional.\nThe Basilica of the National Vow is a Roman Catholic church in the historic center of Quito, Ecuador. It is sometimes also called the Catedral Consagraci\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas or the Bas\u00edlica de San Juan. It is the largest neo-Gothic basilica in the Americas.\nThe basilica arose from the idea, proposed by father Julio Matovelle in 1883, of building a monument as a perpetual reminder of the consecration of Ecuador to the Sacred Heart, President Luis Cordero issued the decree on July 23, 1883, and it was carried out by president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pl\u00e1cido Caama\u00f1o on March 5, 1884. The congress, in accordance with the year's budget, designated 12,000 pesos for the construction - 1,000 pesos per month, beginning in 1884. By the decree of July 3, 1885, the fourth Quitense Provincial Council turned the construction of the basilica into a religious commitment in the name of the country. The basilica remains technically \"unfinished.\" &amp; local legend says that when the Bas\u00edlica is completed, the end of the world will come.\nMetropolitan Cathedral.\nConstruction began in 1562, seventeen years after the diocese of Quito was created (1545) and in the heart of the historic city and its status as the main church of the city, is one of the largest religious symbols of spiritual value for the Catholic community in the city.\nChurch of San Agust\u00edn.\nIt is one of the seven monumental churches of the 16th and 17th centuries whose main portico was built on stone in the Spanish Baroque-architecture style.\nThe church includes a small atrium (decorated by a large stone cross), an inside yard with a large garden and a large session hall where the frayers held dissertations or \"capitulations\" of faith.\nThe cloister and convent have a separate entrance which leads to the garden. The bell tower reaches a high of twenty-two meters (seventy feet) and houses two bronze bells of the period.\nClimate.\nEcuador is a country of variety. Its climate and landscape varies from one end of the country to the other. However, it is more hot and humid along the coast and in the Amazon jungle lowlands than it is in the mountains.\nPlants and animals.\nEcuador is one of 17 megadiverse countries in the world. In addition to the mainland, Ecuador owns the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This is what the country is best known for.\nEcuador has 1,600 bird species and 38 more endemic in the Gal\u00e1pagos. In addition to over 16,000 species of plants, the country has 106 endemic reptiles, 138 endemic amphibians, and 6,000 species of butterfly.

It is in the Levant, between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Many cultures have lived in Palestine through history and built their civilizations, such as the Philistines, Phoenicians and Arabs. It is also called the Holy Land. It is where Judaism and Christianity began.\nToday, the region is divided into two states: occupation Forces and the State of Palestine. The territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have been disputed between Israel and Palestine. Many cities in the region are sacred to Abrahamic religions: Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth and Hebron are among the most important. Now Palestine only owns a quarter of the country.\nIn English it is usually written Philistine. The Philistines were a people who invaded the area. They were probably Romans who did not speak Arabic, not too surprising as the Arabs came to Palestine nearly 2000 years later.\nState of Palestine.\nThe State of Palestine, also known simply as Palestine, is a \"de jure\" sovereign state in the Middle East with Jerusalem as its capital. It is recognized by 141 UN members. Since 2012 it has non-member observer state in the United Nations. This amounts to a \"de facto\", or implicit, recognition of statehood.\nThe State of Palestine claims the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as its territory. Its independence was declared on 15 November 1988.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nThe first people to migrate to the land of Palestine were Canaanites, who came from north of Arabia and normally spoke Arabic. They have also adopted the idea of alphabets from those who lived in the current Lebanon. This migration occurred ca. 5000 b.c. After 3000 years came Israelites who are the sons of Jackob, son of Abraham.\nIsraelites ruled over the region of today's Palestine, which at the time was in an area known as Southern Canaan or the Land of Palestine. The area went from Tyre in the north to Beersheba in the south. After the death of King Solomon, the land was split into a Northern Kingdom known as Samaria and Southern Kingdom known as Judea. The Northern Kingdom was conquered by Assyrian King Sennacherib, expelling most of its Israelite residents. Ava was conquered by the Babylonians more than 100 years later, and much of its Jewish population was expelled as well. However, despite the destruction, some Jews and Samaritans remained in the land. After Persian takeover of the Babylonian Empire, then Jakereturned to Judea and slowly rebuilt their civilization. The area remained under direct Persian rule for 200 years more, with Jews having a limited autonomy. Now most Palestinians go to different countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.\nMacedonian period.\nWith conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon, the area became dominated by Hellenistic rulers - first Alexander himself, later Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt and finally Seleucids. In second century before common era, the Jewish population of the area revolted against Seleucids and founded an independent Hesmonean kingdom. The Jewish kingdom expanded over the region in the next decades, conquering neighbouring Samaritans, Edomeans and Nabateans. Slowly however, the region became dominated by the Roman Empire.\nRoman period.\nAfter a semi-independent rule of King Herod, Judea was turned into a Roman Province. Jews violently revolted against the Romans twice, but the Romans reconquered the whole area and finally renamed it Syria-Palaestina after one of Judea's ancient enemies, the Philistines. After two centuries, the Eastern Roman Empire became known as Byzantium, which became a Christian Empire. Byzantium kept its rule over the country, with Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Secunda districts of the Oriens Province with majorly Byzantine Christian population and big groups of Samaritans, Jews, Greek Byzantines and Christian Arabs.\nMiddle Ages and Ottomans.\nOver the next centuries, the region was briefly conquered by Persians, became part of Arab Muslim Empire, the Crusader kingdom, the Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire. During World War 1, General Allenby attacked the Turkish army in the valley of Megiddo ( Identified as Armageddon in the Bible), from 19 to 25 September 1918. Today Jordan comprises 81% and Israel 19% of Palestine Mandate. Trans-Jordan was established on 25 May 1946, with the intention of Israel being the remaining 19% . Mandate Palestine is divided into Trans- Jordan/Jordan (81%) and Israel (19%), as today the Jordanian capture of East Jerusalem and West Bank has been reversed. The Gaza strip was captured by Israel from Egypt in 1967, and Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.The region is often named Holy Land, and is sacred for Christians, Jews and Muslims who recognize the Ten Commandments."}
{"id": "11271", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11271", "title": "Paul the Apostle", "text": "Paul the Apostle, previously known as Saul of Tarsus and now often called St Paul (2BC\u201367), was a Messianic Jewish-Roman writer and rabbi. He was a convert to Christianity. It is believed that he wrote thirteen books of the Bible, together called the Pauline epistles. They are letters to churches and Christians. He wrote these letters to encourage them, to help them understand Christian teaching, and to help them to live Christian lives.\nLife.\nBeginnings.\nPaul's name was originally Saul (not to be confused with King Saul from the books of Samuel in the Old Testament). He grew up learning both the Jewish law and the Greek ways of discussing things. We are first introduced to Saul in the Bible near the end of Acts 7. The Christian movement had begun with the resurrection and ascension of Jesus. Saul was strongly against this, and he was happy as he watched Saint Stephen, the first martyr of Jesus, being killed by stoning after giving a speech that made the Jewish court angry. He worked for the Roman Government and helped lead the arrests and killing of many Christians in Israel and the nearby area.\nLater on, Saul was told to go to Damascus to find and bring back Christians there to be punished. On the way, God came down from heaven and spoke to Saul. The Bible tells of what happened like this:\nSaul becomes Paul.\nWhen Saul reached Damascus, he was taken to Ananias, one of Jesus's disciples, where he got his sight back and was baptized as a Christian. He spent the next three years studying the Jewish scriptures again to find explanations for the Christian teachings. His experiences changed his view on Christianity completely. In Acts 13:9, he begins to be called Paul. This was the Hellenized version of the name Saul. He used his earlier education to explain his new faith to other people and to discuss things with people who had other beliefs.\nHe traveled around the Roman Empire, teaching others about Christianity, and wrote letters back and forth with the churches he helped to begin. The letters contain many important parts of Christian teaching and have since been part of the New Testament of the Bible, coming between the Acts of the Apostles and the General Epistles. It is not known whether Paul actually wrote all of these letters, or whether other people could have written the letters for him. Part of these letters are read at Mass as the second of two readings that come before the Gospel.\nAlthough the Bible does not say how Paul died, it was told of that Paul was put to death by orders of the emperor Nero in Rome, in 67 AD. He had the rights of a Roman citizen, which meant that he could be put to death by having his head cut off with a sword, rather than by crucifixion."}

Scholars prefer the term Hebrew Bible. \nTertullian was probably the first person to call these books the \"Old Testament.\" He used the Latin name\"vetus testamentum\" in the 2nd century.\nThe collection contains different texts, called \"books\", about God, and the people of Israel. It can be divided into several sections: the Torah, the History of Israel, the Prophets and Wisdom books. In Judaism, this collection of books is known as Tanakh because it is divided into three parts (Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim). Most Jews and many Christians believe these texts to be holy. According to them, God inspired people to write them. \nDifferent religious communities include (or exclude) certain books from the Old Testament. The Catholic Church uses Saint Jerome's Latin translation of the Old Testament called Vulgate. The Eastern Orthodox church uses the ancient Greek translation of Jewish sacred writings called the Septuagint. The Eastern Orthodox list of sacred books has a few more books than the Roman Catholic list. Protestant Bibles stick more closely to the books in the Tanakh but list them in a different order.\nThemes.\nIn the Old Testament, Almighty God is the one who created the world. The God of the Old Testament is not always presented as the only God who exists Even though there may be other gods, the God of the Old Testament is always shown as the only God whom Israel is to worship. The God of the Old Testament is the one \"true God\"; only Yahweh is Almighty. Both Jews and Christians have always interpreted the Bible (both the \"Old\" and \"New\" Testaments) as an affirmation of the oneness of Almighty God.\nThe Old Testament stresses the special relationship between God and his chosen people, Israel, but includes instructions for proselytes as well. This relationship is expressed in the biblical covenant (contract) between the two, received by Moses. The law codes in books such as Exodus and especially Deuteronomy are the terms of the contract: Israel swears faithfulness to God, and God swears to be Israel's special protector and supporter. \"The Jewish Study Bible\" denies that covenant means contract.\nOther themes in the Old Testament include salvation, redemption, divine judgment, obedience and disobedience, faith and faithfulness. Throughout there is a strong emphasis on ethics and ritual purity. God demands both.\nAccording to the Old Testament, it is important to be fair and to help those who are vulnerable. Those in power should not be biased when they judge people. The Old Testament forbids corruption, deceiving people when trading. It is also against some sexual practices, which are seen as sinful. All morality is traced back to God, who is the source of all goodness.\nThe problem of evil plays a large part in the Old Testament. The problem the Old Testament authors faced was that a good God must have had just reason for bringing disaster (meaning notably, but not only, the Babylonian exile) upon his people. The theme is played out, with many variations, in books as different as the histories of Kings and Chronicles, the prophets like Ezekiel and Jeremiah, and in the wisdom books like Job and Ecclesiastes.\nReferences.\nNotes.\na \u2013 Orthodox version: There is an additional book called 1 Ezra, this makes the current Ezra -&gt; 2 Genesis/&lt;br&gt;\nb \u2013 Catholic and Orthodox versions; lacking in Protestant versions&lt;br&gt;\nc \u2013 Can only be found in Orthodox version&lt;br&gt;\nd \u2013 Catholic and Orthodox versions contain verses not found in the original Hebrew &lt;br&gt;\ne \u2013 Not in Protestant version\nf - The first five books of the Bible are called the Pentateuch.

They are herbivores, which means they eat grass and other plants. Some plants are dangerous for them like ragwort, lemongrass (oil grass) and sometimes acorns.\nThe common horse is the species Equus caballus. It was domesticated from wild horses by humans at least 5000 years ago. They are large, strong animals, and some breeds are used to pull heavy loads. Racehorses can gallop up to 30\u00a0miles an hour.\nA male horse is a \"stallion\", and a female horse is a \"mare\". The general term for a young horse is \"foal\". A young female horse is a \"filly\", and a young male horse is a \"colt\". A castrated horse is a \"gelding\". Horses have \"hooves\" which need protection by horseshoes from hard or rough ground.\nEarly horses.\nThe evolution of horses has been well studied. Fifty million years ago, there were no horses as we know them now. Of the earliest fossil horse, the North American one is called \"Eohippus\", and the Eurasian one is called \"Hyracotherium\". Both were small animals: \"Eohippus\" was the larger of the two at twice the size of a terrier dog.\nMany changes took place between those little animals and today's horse. These changes are best explained as adaptations to its changing ecological niche. From a small forest-dweller eating nuts and fruit to a larger forest browser eating leaves and small branches. Finally, the modern horse is a grazer on open grassland, with different teeth, legs for running and much larger size. Major changes happened in the mid-Miocene when the climate became cooler, and grassland began to replace forests. This change continued, and several groups of mammals changed from browsers to grazers.\nHorses and humans.\nHorses have been domesticated for at least 5000 years. They have been used by humans in many different ways for travel, work, food, and pleasure and showing. Cavalry horses were used in war until the middle 20th century. They are used for riding and transport. They are also used for carrying things or pulling carts, or to help plow farmer's fields in agriculture. People have used selective breeding to make bigger horses to do heavy work.\nSome people keep horses as pets. Today, horses are mostly used for entertainment and sports. They are also still used for work and transportation in some places. Horses are used in equestrianism, which is equine sports such as cross-country, showjumping, dressage, horse polo, rodeo, western pleasure, horsemanship, reining, and halter/showmanship events etc. Showjumping, cross-country and dressage are Olympic sports. \"Equus\" is the old Latin word for horse.\nOther uses of horses.\nHorsehide is a tough leather made from the skin of horses. Horsehair is used to make a stiff fabric. Horsehair can also be used as a stuffing for furniture. Horsehair can be mixed with plaster to make it strong. Horse bones can be used to make gelatin for food. The bones can also be used to make glue. Animal glue is still preferred by some wood workers. \nHorses are used all over the world to carry people and pull carts. They are used in big cities to help police watch and protect people in crowds.\nMare.\nA mare is a female horse. Other female equines are also sometimes called mares. Before her third birthday, she is called a filly. When a mare wants to mate, she is called \"in heat\". This part of the estrous cycle lasts for about three weeks. Mares are more prone to being temperamental, some people would call this being \"mare-ish\".\nHorse breeds.\nThese are some well-known horse breeds among the hundreds that exist:"}

Different religions teach different things about the afterlife.\nCharacteristics.\nSome religions believe in reincarnation (to come back to life as a different person or even animal). These religions include Buddhism and Hinduism. Hinduism specifically believes that at death the soul leaves the physical body but does not die. It lives in an astral body in an astral plane. Here the soul continues until it is born again in another physical body as a baby. Salvation (called Moksha) in these religions is a release from this endless cycle of re-births. \nMost people in the world believe you go to another place after you die, such as heaven or hell. Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Jainism are religions that believe in this. For example, those that follow Christianity believe that if you accept the Christ (Jesus of Nazareth, the son of the Virgin Mary) as your saviour, you will spend eternity in heaven after death; if you do not accept him, you will be separated from him after death. \nMany other religions believe in an afterlife of some kind. Ancient Egyptians believed in an `afterlife`. They put things into the graves of important people. These were to be used in the next life. The Vikings had some similar beliefs. Others (like African animists) believe that some people change into spirits called ghosts.\nThere are also those who do not believe that there is an afterlife, and that you simply cease to exist once you die. Atheists believe there is no God and no afterlife. The Sadducees were a sect of Judaism in the time of Jesus. The believed there was no spirit in man. So, after death there was no more life. ."}

It means creation. It begins with the creation of the Universe. It ends with the death of Joseph. The Hebrew name for the book is transliterated Bre'shiyth, which means 'in beginning.'\nSummary.\nGod created the universe and everything in it in six days. God rested on the seventh day (Sabbath) and declared it a holy day of rest. God provided the Garden of Eden to the first man, Adam, and the first woman, Eve. There was only one thing that they were not allowed to do. God told them not to eat from the tree of knowledge, which would make them aware of good and evil. A snake tricked Eve, and she ate the fruit from the tree of knowledge. She then gave Adam some of the fruit, and he ate as well. Because they did not obey him, God made them leave the garden, so all people had to work for their food.\nAdam and Eve's first two children were sons, Cain and Abel. Abel was a shepherd and Cain was a farmer. Cain fell into sin and killed his brother Abel out of jealousy, making him the first person to commit murder. (Genesis 4:1\u201316)\nLater, when the world was full of people who were evil, God chose to kill them and save only the animals and the most morally righteous person alive. He told a man, named Noah, to build a huge boat and gather two of every bird, mammal and lizard onto it. He was instructed to take 14, or a pair of 7, of clean animals. Only 2 of each could be unclean. Noah built and filled the boat as he was told, and a flood covered the whole world. After 40 days and nights, the rains stopped. Once the water had receded the boat landed on the mountain of Ararat. God promised never to send another such flood, and he used the rainbow as a sign of that promise.\nThe people of the world attempted to build a high tower (Tower of Babel) to show the power of mankind and to reach God. God felt insulted and gave people different languages to prevent the tower from ever being finished.\nGod chose Abram to be \"the father of many nations.\" Abram changed his name to Abraham, and God promised him the land of Canaan (Israel) forever. As a sign of this promise, the sons of Abraham are circumcised. God tested Abraham's loyalty by asking him to kill his son Isaac. Abraham was ready to do it, but God sent an angel to stop him. God told him there would be no more human sacrifice.\nGod destroyed the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, saving only Abraham's nephew Lot and his daughters.\nIsaac and his wife Rebekah had two twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Jacob traded food to Esau for Esau's right to carry the family name. Rebekah helped trick Isaac, who was old and blind, into giving his final blessing to Jacob by dressing him in fur (Isaac felt Jacob's furs and thought he was his hairy twin, Esau). Esau later got a blessing of his own.\nJacob left to find a wife. He found Rachel and worked for her father, Lavan, for seven years to marry her, but was tricked into marrying her sister Leah. He worked for another seven years to marry Rachel. He went back to his home, then moved to Bethel, where God told him to change his name to Israel. Jacob later also marries the servants of Leah and Rachel, whose names are Bilah and Zilpah.\nJacob had twelve sons named Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issaschar, Zebulun, Gad, Dan, Asher, Naftali, Joseph, and Benjamin. His wife Rachel died after she gave birth to Benjamin.\nJacob gave his son Joseph a coat of many colors. Joseph's brothers were jealous, so they sold him into slavery in Egypt. They covered his coat in blood and told their father he had died. Joseph became a great leader in Egypt by predicting a long famine by explaining the pharaoh's dreams. During the famine, his brothers came to Egypt to buy food. They did not know that Joseph was the leader. Joseph first tricked the brothers, but then gave them food and let them stay in Goshen in Egypt.\nJacob blessed his sons and then died."}

In Islamic tradition they threw him in a large well that had only a little salt water but when he drank it, by the will of God, it was very sweet. A passing caravan found him and took him as a slave to Egypt.\nJoseph became the slave of the chief of the Pharaoh's guards but was put in prison, where he interpreted the dreams of other prisoners. The Pharaoh heard of his power and asked for interpretations of his own dreams. Joseph became the Pharaoh's prime minister. This caused the Israelites to leave Canaan and live in Egypt. "}

{"id": "11309", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11309", "title": "Sparta", "text": "Sparta was a Greek city-state. It is the capital of the Laconia prefecture. It is in the south of Peloponnese peninsula. During antiquity, it was extremely powerful. Today, it is a small city. 16,726 people lived there according to the 2001 census. \nIt was also known as Lacedaemon.\nThe word \"Spartan\" is used to describe somebody who lives a simple life or somebody who suffered a lot without crying or showing that they suffered. It can also mean a life of simplicity, without anything fancy or costly.\nSparta is in the mountainous region of Laconia. This is in the south-east of the Peloponnese. Ancient Sparta was built on the banks of the Evrotas River. The river flows through a valley with mountains on each side. To the west is the Taygetus Range (highest point 2407 m) and to the east is the Parnon Range (highest point 1935 m). Because the ancient Spartans had such good natural defenses, they did not need city walls.\nAncient Sparta.\nIn Ancient Greece, Sparta was a city-state with a very strong army and a government that was well led. Sparta was known as one of the strongest city-states in Greece. Only the strongest survived in Sparta, male or female. The Spartans killed weak children. If they believed that a baby was too weak, they left it out to die of exposure beside a slope on Mount Taygetus. This place was called the \"Apothetae\", which meant 'the place of rejection'.\nSparta had a government with checks and balances. The executive branch was led by two kings. The legislative branch was led by the citizens. and the judicial branch was controlled by the elders. There was also a committee of five men who were in charge of the education process that young boys and girls went through. Boys and girls were taken from their parents at the age of 7. Boys went to live in barracks with other boys their age. Girls went to school to learn gymnastics, wrestling, and other activities, so they could become strong, healthy mothers for future soldiers.\nLaconophilia.\n\"Laconophilia\" is love or liking of Sparta and of the Spartan culture. Sparta was often admired when it ruled. Long ago, \"Many of the noblest and best of the Athenians always considered (thought) the Spartan state nearly as an ideal theory realised in practice\". Many Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, would often describe Sparta as a good state, strong, brave, and free.\nSparta was also seen as a model of social purity by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France.\nAdolf Hitler thought Sparta was very good. He said in 1928 that Germany should be like them by making smaller \"the number allowed to live\". The Spartans had created \"the first racialist state\".\nCustoms.\nYoung Spartans boys were taken from their homes at the age of seven to begin a military life. The Spartans became soldiers at age 20, citizens at age 30, and retired at age 60. Men trained hard to become warriors of the Spartan army. Women were encouraged to keep healthy so that they could produce healthy, fit babies to grow up to be strong. Spartans saw little moral value in the concept of childbirth; unless the child was fit to become a Spartan, he would die.\nSpartan men married when they were 30 years old. Plutarch writes of the strange custom of the Spartans for their wedding night:\nThe custom was to capture women for marriage...The...'bridesmaid' took charge of the captured girl. She first shaved her head...then dressed her in a man's cloak and sandals, and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark. The bridegroom...first had dinner...then would slip in...lift her and carry her to the bed. The husband kept on visiting his wife in secret for some time after the marriage. Only Spartans did these customs. Some people think that the cutting off of the wife's hair was a ceremony that showed she was going into a new life.\nHistory.\nSparta conquered the people of Messenia and Lakonia (the surrounding countryside) at around 680560 BC. These people became known as the \"helots\". They were \"not\" slaves: they were serfs. They had a lower position in society, like serfs in mediaeval Europe.\nHelots spent their lives farming their Spartan masters \"kleros\" (land granted to Spartan citizens). The Spartan poet Tyrtaios says helots were allowed to marry and keep half the fruits of their labor. At most times, the helots outnumbered their Spartan masters 10 to 1. They rebelled often, but they were never able to overthrow their oppressors. \nOnce a Spartan reached the age of 20, he or she would then become a \"homoios\". A homoios was a member of the ruling class (a citizen). Both men and women were citizens. Sparta was an unusual society for women's rights, because women were considered to be equal. \nThe Spartan army used the phalanx formation. This contributed to the many battles Sparta won. Their most famous loss is the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans held off a large Persian army for a week."}

The Olympic Games were held every four years throughout Classical Antiquity, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. The first Olympic Games were in honour of Zeus.\nHistory.\nOlympia was a sanctuary, consisting of various buildings. These included a hippodrome, Palaestra, Gymnasium and several temples. The Olympic Games began here in 776 BC. They were founded by king Pelopas. They happened every four years, in the summers. All the ancient Greek towns competed. The winners of the Olympic games were important people. The Olympic games were abolished by emperor of Byzantium Theodosius I, in 394 AD.\nDuring ancient history, Olympia was a powerful and rich town. It ruled over the west of Peloponnese. Olympia kept its strength and during Roman period. During the Middle Ages it was an unimportant city.\nGymnasium.\nThe Gymnasium at Olympia was a large, open air, quadrangle surrounded on all four sides by colonnades of the Doric order. Only the southern and eastern sides survive. They date to the second century BC. The River Kladeos has destroyed the western side. The gymnasium was used by runners and pentathlon athletes for training. Athletes trained in the nude. In bad weather, training took place under the eastern colonnade (210.51 meters) and the other three colonnades. Little of the gymnasium has been excavated. About 200 BC, a portico of the Corinthian order was built to join the gymnasium and the palaestra.\nHippodrome.\nThe Hippodrome was the site of horse and chariot races at Olympia, Greece. It was 1,153 meters long. It was south of the stadium, but none of it survives. It was washed away by the Alpheios River."}

There were 325,182 people at the census of 2011. Including the suburbs, there were 1,110,312 people. It is in the region of Macedonia in northern Greece. It is the capital of the Thessaloniki prefecture and it is the capital of the periphery of central Macedonia. It is the largest city in the geographical region of Macedonia. It has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The average rainfall is relatively low, due to the rain shadow from the Pindos mountains. Unlike in Athens, there are frequent frosts and snow every winter.\nHistory.\nThessaloniki was established by King Cassander of Macedon, friend of Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C. He named the city after the sister of Alexander the Great, princess Thessalonike, which in Greek means \"victory over Thessaly\". \nFrom late antiquity to the late Middle Ages (330AD-1430AD) it was the second most important city of Byzantine Empire. Then Thessaloniki faced many invasions from enemies such as the Avaroi, Bulgars and others. In the year 1204, the crusaders conquered Thessaloniki and created the Kingdom of Thessalonica. Later it was liberated by Byzantines and then sold to the Republic of Venice but the year 1430, it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. \nThessaloniki was a part of Ottoman Empire for approximately 500 years and in 1912 it became part of Greece when Greece acquired Macedonia following the Balkan Wars. Many famous people have lived or were born here, such as the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, many saints like Cyril and Methodius, who invented the Cyrillic alphabet, and Saint Demetrius, who is the patron saint of the city, and many politicians, such as the founder of modern-day Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. Most of the city was completely destroyed in a large fire in 1917 and was rebuilt in the 1920s. Thessaloniki was place to both the Salonica and Macedonian fronts during World War 1, this fronts were made of French, Serbian, English, Italian, and a Russian division. This fronts were key in 1918 to the Entente victory over both Bulgaria and Austria. It was later occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War, during the Greek Invasion.\nSights of Thessaloniki.\nThessaloniki has many sights. The most famous sight in Thessaloniki is the white tower. The White tower was a part of Thessaloniki's ancient walls that were built many times through the ages. Thessaloniki was the second-most well-fortified city in the Byzantine Empire, after Constantinople (Istanbul). The walls can still be seen above the city today and despite the many earthquakes, they are still standing. The city was home to a Roman imperial palace and mausoleum. The palace ruins can be seen today but the mausoleum together with a Roman arch can be still seen standing today. Very important sights of Thessaloniki are the medieval churches such as Agios Dimitrios, Agios Georgios and Agia Sofia. Agios Dimitrios it the largest and oldest Basilica in Greece. Thessaloniki's Christian monuments are part of the UNESCO World Heritage initiative. The city also has many Ottoman monuments, such as the Bey Hammam and the old district of the city near the walls, with its distinctly Turkish architecture. Many museums are in the city and some of them are: Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, Jewish Museum, Ethnological Museum of Macedonia and others. \nThessaloniki is known throughout Greece and the countries nearby as a city with a great nightlife even in winter, when most famous Greek tourist destinations are closed. It is also widely considered the Greek city of love due to its many romantic streets and alleys. "}

Amsterdam is famous for its canals and dikes. Unlike in capitals of most other countries, the national government, parliament, government ministries, supreme court, royal family and embassies are not in Amsterdam, but in The Hague. The only diplomatic offices present in Amsterdam are consulates.\nAbout 873,000 people were living in Amsterdam in 2021. The city hosts two universities (the University of Amsterdam and the Free University Amsterdam) and an international airport \"Schiphol Airport\". About 2.2 million people live in the metropolitan area. The city of Amsterdam is the world's most multi-cultural city. It has people living there from 175 different countries. Like other big cities in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world, Amsterdam is unfortunately subjected to many criminal activities.\nHistory.\nA dam was built in 13th century in the river Amstel (that's why the city is called Amsterdam). The old harbor of the city, \"Damrak\", is now one of the busiest streets in the city. The city was for the first time mentioned in 1275 by count Floris V, count of Holland and Zeeland who gave the people of Amsterdam some more freedom. The city got its city rights probably in 1306; at least soon after the year 1300. The city became a major trading port pretty soon, with a successful trading route to the Baltic Sea. The city grew fast in the 15th century. Because the city basically lies in swamp, the builders of the city had to dig canals to use the digging-ground for getting the living-ground higher. Homes were built on wooden poles, and the canals served as a pretty effective primitive sewer.\nThe city was one of the first cities in Western Europe to be fairly democratic: Wealthy citizens chose the leaders of the city. Amsterdam declared war on the Spanish in 1578, during the Eighty Years' War. When the city of Antwerp fell to the Spanish in 1585, many people of Antwerp fled to Amsterdam. Antwerp was also a major trading city, and when its people moved to Amsterdam, they took their trading-networks with them. That's why Amsterdam became an even more important trading city after that. This launched the Dutch Golden Age. The number of people living in Amsterdam during the War rose from less than 30,000 in 1570 to over 100,000 in 1622. That number would even rise to 200,000 near the end of the 17th century, making the city a very large city for its time (only London and Paris also had that many people). In the 18th century, the number of people living in Amsterdam fell back to 140,000, ending the Golden Age.\nThe 19th century was the time for the first trains and trams in Amsterdam. The first train ran from Amsterdam to Haarlem in 1839. The number of people was rising, with about 250,000 living in Amsterdam in 1850, and more than 500,000 in 1900. Amsterdam was a heavy industrialised city by then. Before the Second World War, there were about 140,000 Jews living in Amsterdam. Most of those people did not survive the war. After the war, Amsterdam became a centre of tolerance and culture; to be different is not abnormal in Amsterdam. It is expected that Amsterdam will grow 12.6% until 2025. It will then hold almost 900,000 people, and the metropolitan area will hold almost 2.5 million people by then.\nDistricts.\nAmsterdam consists of eight districts:"}

{"id": "11424", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11424", "title": "Cannabis", "text": "Cannabis is a genus of plant. There are three species: \"Cannabis sativa\", \"Cannabis indica\", and \"Cannabis ruderalis\".\nThe cannabis plant's flowers contain a chemical or drug known as THC (short for \"tetra-hydro-cannabinol\"). Smoking or eating the flower can make a person feel euphoric (very good) or sleepy. The plant is also used to make hemp fibre, and for its seeds and seed oil.\nIn its natural environment, THC's purpose was to protect itself against being eaten. There are many varieties of cannabis, and those low on THC production are selected for producing hemp and seeds.\nSince the 19th century, Cannabis has become an illegal drug in many countries. In the 21st century, some countries have made cannabis legal again. Others allow cannabis to be used as medicine when people have certain medical conditions.\nAncient history.\nScientists believe that cannabis first grew somewhere in the Himalayas. Evidence of people smoking cannabis goes as far back as prehistory: archaeologists have found burnt hemp seeds at a burial site in what is now Romania. \nThe most famous users of cannabis were the ancient Hindus, who called it \"ganjika\" in Sanskrit (\"ganja\" in modern Indian languages). According to legend, the Indian god Shiva told his followers to worship the plant. The ancient drug soma was sometimes associated with cannabis.\nPeople in the Persian Empire (what is now Iran) would light giant campfires made of cannabis, exposing themselves to the smoke. The ceremony was known as \"the booz-rooz.\"\nCannabis was also known in ancient Greece, where magicians would burn its flowers in order to cause strange thoughts in the audience members' minds. Historians think that the cult of Dionysus also began in ancient Greece and involved inhaling cannabis smoke.\"\nDrug effects.\nWhen a person inhales cannabis smoke or consumes cannabis, he or she may get a feeling called \"getting high\" or \"getting stoned\". Cannabis's most common effects include feeling happy, relaxed, tired, silly or scared; having many ideas about what to do; not being able to think clearly (or remember some things at all); and getting hungry (also called getting \"the munchies\"). Smoking cannabis changes how people think and feel, making it either harder or easier to solve some problems. Some people who take cannabis feel strange or paranoid (worried that something bad is going to happen).\nHashish (dried resin) is much more concentrated than cannabis (it includes both leaves and flowers). Because of this, people who take large amounts of hashish may feel even stronger effects. They may also see things or hear things that do not exist (these are called hallucinations). They may also have strange thoughts. Some hashish users like the feeling of these visions and thoughts, while others may find them scary. However, people rarely get hallucinations after smoking or eating cannabis.\nLegal status.\nMedical cannabis.\nAs of 2016, many different countries and some states in the United States have made it legal for people with certain medical problems to use cannabis as a medicine. Medical use of cannabis is legal in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Israel, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom\nIn the United States, as of February 2018, 30 states, plus Washington, D.C. and Guam, had legalized medical cannabis. However, using cannabis for any reason is still illegal under federal law.\nAccording to a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine, cannabis (especially THC) can decrease pain; control nausea and vomiting; and improve appetite. As of June 2016, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, \"Further studies have found that cannabis [helps] some of the symptoms of HIV/AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.\nPersonal use.\nOn December 11, 2013, Uruguay was the first country in the world to make it legal to grow, sell, and use cannabis for personal (or recreational) use. Other countries that allow people to have small amounts of cannabis (just enough for them to use personally) include Colombia, Ecuador, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland. In the United States, on January 1, 2014, the states of Washington and Colorado made it legal for people aged 21 or older to buy cannabis. In November 2016, California did the same thing, and has been selling cannabis in stores since January 2018. As of October 17th, 2018, Canada has become the first G7 nation to make cannabis legal. Each province of Canada has its own legal minimum age to buy and use (either 18-years-old and older, 19-years-old and older, or 21-years-old and older) and how much of it is allowed to have at one time.\nHealth risks.\nCannabis is one of the least dangerous of the commonly used illegal drugs. It is almost impossible to overdose on cannabis. A person would have to smoke their entire body weight in five minutes in order to overdose.\nAs of 1995, scientists had not shown that smoking cannabis causes lung cancer, even in people who smoke a lot of cannabis for a long time.\nIt is a common belief that people who use cannabis are less interested in life and may not want to go to school or work (scientists call this \"amotivational syndrome\"). However, many reports show that people who use cannabis do just as well as non-users.\nDriving while \"stoned\".\nA person who is intoxicated (\"high\" or \"stoned\") from cannabis could get hurt or killed in an accident if they drive a car. It is not safe to drive under the influence of any intoxicant. However, drivers who are \"stoned\" are much less likely to get into car accidents than drunk drivers and in some cases, sober drivers.\nAddiction.\n\"Hard drugs\", such as heroin, meth, and cocaine, are chemically addictive. This means that if a person starts taking heroin, meth, or cocaine, that person's body will physically need to keep taking the drug. If they try to stop using the drug, they may become very sick. Cannabis and hashish are not \"chemically\" addictive, but they can be \"psychologically\" or habitually addictive. This means that people can get so used to the pleasure cannabis causes that they feel as if they need the drug. Unlike with alcohol, tobacco, and hard drugs, most people who use cannabis can stop taking it when they want, while experiencing only minor withdrawal symptoms. However, while cannabis may not be as addictive as other drugs, people can still become very much addicted to the pleasure of cannabis."}

Other big cities are Las Vegas, Henderson and Reno.\nHistory.\nNevada was originally founded in 1821 as part of the First Mexican Empire. The Mexican Empire turned into the Mexican Republic in 1823, along with Nevada. Before the arrival of Europeans, Nevada was inhabited by Native American tribes including the Shoshone, the Paiute, the Washoe, and the Mohave. \nThe Mexican-American Conflict.\nFighting between the United States and Mexico started. They fought over what was to become the Southwestern United States and who could own this land. This was called the Mexican-American War. The war ended in an American victory in 1848. Nevada later became an American territory in 1861. It was called the \"Nevada Territory\". This was not all of Nevada as it is today. The eastern part of Nevada was part of \"Utah Territory\" and the southern part was part of \"New Mexico\". In 1859 in the Comstock Lode, gold and silver were first discovered. This started a huge growth in mining in the state which Nevada is known for.\nGaining statehood.\nOn October 31, 1864, now celebrated as \"Nevada Day\", Nevada was made the 36th state in the United States. It was given the distinct shape resembling a rectangle with a triangle. It was named \"Nevada\" meaning \"snowy land\" in Spanish, because it was snowy in the North. Later, on May 5, 1866, Nevada got its current borders because the Pah-Ute County in Arizona was taken as part of Nevada. It is now Clark County, Nevada.

It is food for people and other animals, for example, chickens and horses. Oatmeal is made from oats. Oat straw is used as bedding for animals.\nPorridge is made only from whole grain oats. It forms an excellent part of a balanced diet for the following reasons:\nOrigin.\nThe wild ancestor of \"Avena sativa\" and the similar minor crop, \"A. byzantina\", is the hexaploid wild oat \"A. sterilis\". Science of DNA shows that the ancestor forms of \"A. sterilis\" grew in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East.\nDomesticated oats appear later. They are also far from the Near East, in Bronze Age Europe. Oats are like rye. They are normally thought as a less important crop, i.e. coming from a weed out of the main cereals wheat and barley As these cereals spread into cooler, wetter places, this may have favored the oat weed. This quickly leads to its common use.\nCultivation.\nOats are grown all over temperate places. They have a lower summer heat need and are able to survive more rain than other cereals like wheat, rye or barley. Oats are an annual plant, and can be planted either in autumn (for late summer harvest) or in the spring (for early autumn harvest).\nHistorical attitudes towards oats are very different. Oat bread was first made in England, where the first oat bread factory was made in 1899. In Scotland, are well liked, as a good part of the national diet. The English writer Samuel Johnson, famously wrote in \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" that the oat was \"a grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.\" Which the Scottish quickly said back \"and England has the best horses, and Scotland the best men.\"\nUses.\nOats have many uses in food. Most of the time they are rolled or crushed into oatmeal, or ground into oat flour. Oatmeal is also eaten as porridge, but may also be used in many of baked goods, such as oat cakes, oatmeal cookies, and oat bread. Oats are also an substance used in many cold cereals, in particular muesli and granola. Without cooking, oats may also be taken as food.\nOats are also sometimes used in drinks. In Britain, it is used for making beer. Oatmeal stout is one of many beers using some oats. A cold, sweet drink made of ground oats and milk is a well liked drink in Latin America. 'Oatmeal caudle', made of ale and oatmeal with spices was a usual British drink and well-liked by Oliver Cromwell.\nIn Scotland a dish called \"Sowans\" was made by putting the husks from oats in water for a week so that the fine, dusty part of the meal remained at the bottom to be strained off, boiled and taken as food (Gauldie 1981). Oats are also widely used there as a thickener in soups, as barley or rice might be used in other countries.\nOats and its hulls are also commonly used as feed for horses - as whole or rolled oats or as part of food bits. Cattle are also fed oats, either whole, or ground into a flour using a mill.\nOat straw is prized by cattle and horse makers as bedding, because its soft, almost dust-free, and takes in liquid. The straw can also be used for making corn dollies. Tied in a cotton bag, oat straw was used to soften bath-water.\nThings take out of oatscan also be used to make pain less sharp in the skin, as in skin lotions. It is the main substance in the Aveeno line of products.\nHealth.\nOats are mostly thought as \"healthy\" food. The finding of the healthy LDL cholesterol-lowering properties has led to more liking of oats as human food.\nProtein.\nOat is the only cereal having a globulin or legume-like protein, avenalin, as the major (80%) storage protein. Globulins can be taken up by weak salt water. The more common cereal proteins are gluten and zein. The minor protein of oat is avenin.\nOat protein is almost the same in quality as soy bean protein, which has been shown by the World Health Organization to be equal to meat, milk, and egg protein. The amount of protein of the hull-less oat kernel ranges from 12\u201324%, which is the highest among cereals."}

The Kinsey scale shows that sexuality is a continuum, meaning it moves little by little from heterosexuality to homosexuality. On the Kinsey scale, a \"0\" is someone who is only heterosexual. A \"6\" is someone who is only homosexual. Someone who is equally homosexual and heterosexual (bisexual) is a \"3\".\nIn biology, bisexual can define an organism that has both male and female organs.

Its capital and largest city is Zagreb. It was one of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became independent in 1991. It joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.\nHistory.\nIn earlier times, the land now known as Croatia was inhabited by different kinds of humans including Neanderthals and Neolithic cultures. In Roman times, seafaring pirates known to the Romans as the Dalmatian Tribes lived there, as the Histri, Liburni and the Delmatae. The Romans conquered and annexed the territory in 9 AD, calling it the province of \"Dalmatia,\" named after these tribes. During more than 400 years of Roman rule, the province of Dalmatia would become Romanized. The Roman invaders mixed with the natives and their descendants adopted a Roman lifestyle even after the collapse of the Roman state in 476 AD.\nIn the early seventh century AD, pagan West Slavs named the Croats (where Croatia gets its name) came to live in the former province of Dalmatia when they conquered the people already living there. However, they would soon be influenced by Roman Catholic Christian missionaries who completed the process of Christianization in the early 9th century. From the time of the crowning of Tomislav in 925 as the first King of Croatia, Croatia would become its own independent Catholic kingdom until 1102, when a Hungarian prince inherited the Croatian throne. The Hungarians would rule as Kings of Croatia until the early modern period, when the last Hungarian king of Croatia Louis II was killed at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526 and the kingdom chose the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand as king the next year. \nCroatia would remain as a part of the empire of Austria-Hungary under Ferdinand's descendants until 1918. In 1918 it became a part of Kingdom of Slovenians, Croats and Serbs, later named Yugoslavia which was occupied in World War II. \nAfter a short war with Italy a fascist dictatorship formed the Independent State of Croatia in 1941, but it was not independent from the control of Nazi Germany (see also Jasenovac concentration camp).\nIn 1945, Croatia became a part of new Yugoslavia (Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) which was non-aligned after breaking connections with Eastern Bloc. It collapsed in 1991 as initially Slovenia, than Croatia, later other republics claimed independence and became parliamentary democracies. War with Yugoslavia made a strong impact on society in economic, political and cultural terms. Civil society and media that came out of anti-war struggle in Croatia grew against nationalism, media and civil freedoms, later also corruption.\nThe country's democratic development around 2000, made it possible for Croatia to finally join Slovenia as only the second republic to become the European Union member on 1 July 2013. \nIn recent decades Croatia is increasingly popular tourist destination, especially the coastal regions of Dalmatia and Istria. \nGeography.\nCroatia is in Central and Southeast Europe, bordering Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the south-east, Montenegro to the south-east, the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42\u00b0 and 47\u00b0 N and longitudes 13\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum.

It is one of his best-known plays, and many lines have become famous quotations. The play is often just called Hamlet.\n\"Hamlet\" was written between 1600 and 1602, and first printed in 1603. With 4042 lines and 29551 words, Hamlet is the longest Shakespearean play.\nPlot.\nHamlet is a young prince in Denmark who was supposed to become king when his father (also named Hamlet) died. Instead, Hamlet's uncle Claudius took the throne for himself and married Hamlet's mother, Gertrude. Hamlet meets a ghost of his dead father, who tells him that he was poisoned by Claudius. The ghost demands that Hamlet kill Claudius in revenge.\nHamlet is at first not sure whether to believe the ghost, so he tries to investigate. He pretends to be mad to hide what he is doing. As the play goes on, it becomes hard to tell if Hamlet is actually mad or still just pretending. His behaviour causes him to fall out with Ophelia, a girl he was in love with. He eventually has the idea of getting some actors to put on a play about a king being killed, in the same way that the ghost described, to see how Claudius reacts. Claudius panics when he sees the play, and Hamlet sees this as proof that his uncle is a murderer.\nHamlet has a chance to kill Claudius in the castle chapel, but cannot bring himself to do it. He instead visits his mother, and they have an argument because Hamlet is unhappy that she married Cladius. Someone moves behind a curtain and Hamlet, thinking it is Claudius, stabs him. It turns out that he has killed Polonius, a royal advisor and Ophelia's father. Claudius orders Hamlet to be exiled to England. He sets up a plot to have Hamlet killed, but Hamlet escapes and returns to Denmark. Meanwhile, Ophelia has been suffering from madness after falling out with Hamlet. After learning that he has killed her father, she drowns herself. Hamlet arrives at Ophelia's funeral and gets into a fight with her brother Laertes. Laertes blames Hamlet for the deaths of his sister and father, and wants revenge. He challenges Hamlet to a swordfight. Hamlet agrees.\nThe swordfight is arranged to take place at the castle. To get Hamlet killed, Claudius gets Laertes to fight with a sword that has poison on the blade, and brings some poisoned wine in case this does not work. The swordfight begins. After some fighting, Laertes wounds Hamlet and poisons him. After more fighting, they drop their swords and Hamlet ends up fighting and wounding Laertes with the poisoned sword. Laertes shows regret for what he has done and tells Hamlet about the poison as he dies. Meanwhile, Gertrude drinks the poisoned wine by mistake and dies. Realising that he is also dying, Hamlet stabs Claudius with the poisoned sword and forces him to drink the rest of the wine. In his last moments, Hamlet tells his friend Horatio that Fortinbras, a Norwegian prince, should be named as the next King of Denmark.\nCharacters.\nThe characters in the story are:\nActing Hamlet.\nHamlet is one of the hardest parts for an actor to perform. It is one of the largest roles written by Shakespeare. Many people disagree about what Hamlet is really thinking. For many actors, playing Hamlet is one of the most important parts of their career.\nHamlet in movies.\nThere have been many movies made of the play. Most of them show only part of the play, because the entire play is very long. Some of the most famous movies include:"}

Bias can be influenced by a number of factors, such as popularity (for example, a newspaper might be biased towards a particular political party due to their employees sharing the same political beliefs as that party). \nBias in an article or editorial would show one point of view, using selected facts and quotes to support that point of view. Facts or opinions that do not support the point of view in a biased article would be excluded. For example, an article biased toward riding a motorcycle would show facts about the good gas mileage, fun, and agility. An article biased against motorcycle riding would show facts about risk of injury and noise, and ignore positive facts about motorcycles.\nAn article biased against guns would show only facts and information that support the author's position. They would list suicides, accidental shootings and other facts showing guns in a negative way. An article biased for guns should show only information that supports the author's position. The positively biased article would discuss 'lives saved' by guns, numbers of crimes prevented by civilian gun use, and other facts and data that put gun ownership and guns in a good light.\nBias in writing can also be shown by using bad or slang words to refer to groups of people or things. \"Broads\" rather than \"women\"; \"murdercycles\" rather than \"motorcycles\". Words or phrasing that make wide assumptions about races or groups of people also indicates bias. \"All Chinese people are good at math\". \nBias also means mistakes in measurements. For example, a person may measure the height of another person wearing shoes. The shoes make the height more than the same person without shoes. If the extra height of the shoes (extra bias) was not explained, someone might think that the person had been measured without shoes on. Data with extra parts not explained is called biased data."}

They are thought to have originated when a keyboard was attached to a psaltery. This makes them different from a clavichord where the strings are hit. The piano is therefore closer to a clavichord than a harpsichord. On a piano it is possible to play louder or quieter by playing the keys with more or less force. On a harpsichord the volume (playing louder or softer) cannot be controlled by the way it is played. However, some large harpsichords have several \"stops\", each one giving a different kind of sound. The largest harpsichords have two manuals (keyboards) which gives more variety. It makes it possible for the right hand to play the tune on one manual while the left hand plays an accompaniment more quietly on the other.\nSome small harpsichords were called \"virginals\", perhaps because they were played by young girls. There are also spinets which were very small and sometimes wing-shaped. They could be picked up and put on a table.\nHarpsichords were very important in music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. They were used as solo instruments as well as to accompany an orchestra. Some of the most famous composers of harpsichord music are William Byrd (1543-1623), Fran\u00e7ois Couperin (1668-1733), Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757) and Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). The last of these composers wrote \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", which has a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key. It is said that Bach wrote this collection of music to show how keyboard instruments like the harpsichord can be tuned in a way to make playing in any key possible."}

All of the speech was in three languages that were spoken at the time of Jesus: Latin, Greek and Hebrew. The movie spent a lot of time showing details of the suffering and death of Jesus, with lots of violent scenes. Mel Gibson said that this was a realistic showing of what happened, though others thought it showed too much violence.\nJewish groups and Christians objected to the movie because it showed the Jewish leaders arranging to have Jesus killed. There were also other depictions in the film of Jews that many Jews and Christians felt was controversial. They said that this would cause people to think that modern-day Jews were guilty because of this and increase antisemitism and inaccurate beliefs of Jews. The movie makers said that this was not their intention, however criticism from both sides continued and still persists to this day.\nMel Gibson was unable to get support from movie studios for this movie, and so supplied the money for it (around $25 million) mostly himself.

{"id": "11584", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11584", "title": "Judas Priest", "text": "Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band. They formed in The Black Country, England in 1969. They are famous for having two guitar players, named Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing. The singer, Rob Halford, left the band in the early 1990s because of problems with the other people in the band. He went back to the band in 2003.\nOn 7 December 2010, the band said they would play their last concert tour during 2011, But they are still a band, and have made a new album called \"Redeemer of Souls\".\nHistory.\n70s.\nForming.\nJudas Priest used to be a different band to the one that is together now. The lead singer for this old band was called Al Atkins. Around the same time, guitar player K.K. Downing and bass player Ian Hill put together their own band, and when they were looking for a lead singer, they found Al Atkins. His band called Judas Priest had broken up by then, and he suggested that KK and Ian should use the same name. They kept on using the name even after Atkins left in 1973.\nWhen the band was looking for another singer, Ian Hill discovered the singing talents of his girlfriend's brother, Rob Halford. He joined the band.\nDuring the seventies, the band went through several drummers, including Alan Moore, John Hinch, Simon Phillips and Les Binks.\nFirst five albums.\nBefore Judas Priest recorded their first album, a second guitar player, Glenn Tipton, joined the band. The first album, Rocka Rolla, came out in 1974. It was not very successful, probably because it didn't have many of the songs that the band were known for playing in live concerts back in those days. They would later be on the band's next album, Sad Wings of Destiny in 1976. That album was followed up by Sin After Sin in 1977. These three albums had a hard rock style that was familiar to bands like Led Zeppelin, and had a psychedelic feel.\nThe band's fourth album, Stained Class, had less of a psychedelic sound and was rockier sounding. This was the first album to have drummer Les Binks, who had a drumming style that was liked by many fans, and is thought of as important for improving the band's sound. The fitth album, Killing Machine (called Hell Bent for Leather in America because of the original title suggesting murder) was also rockier sounding but had shorter songs. \"Hell Bent for Leather\" from the album is one of the band's more popular songs. Les Binks left after this album.\nIt was also during the late 70s/early 80s that Rob Halford started putting together stage costumes of S&amp;M leather and studs. This was done to express that he was gay - he felt like he needed to keep this from the fans in case it would hurt the band's popularity, and he did not come out until 1998. The S&amp;M look was not thought at the time by fans to be a symbol of homosexuality, and it was copied by many other metal bands.\n80s.\nLes was replaced by Dave Holland, who drummed with the band on all their 80s albums.\nSucess with British Steel and similar albums.\nThe band gained much more fame with album #6 in 1980, called British Steel. The album is said to be important for building on what we know as the heavy metal sound and is one of their most popular, including hit songs like \"Metal Gods\" \"Breaking the Law\" and \"Living After Midnight\". The next album, Point of Entry, didn't do as well.\nAlbum #8, Screaming For Vengeance, was a return to success and had the hits \"Electric Eye\" and \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" Album #9. Defenders of the Faith, had a similar style.\nChange to pop-metal sound.\nAlbum #10, however, called Turbo, had more of a pop-metal sound with synthesizers on all the songs and lyrics with sexual themes. This is best demonstrated in the first song \"Turbo Lover\". It received mixed critic reviews who had doubts about the change in sound. The next album, Ram It Down, mixed the pop metal sound of Turbo with the heavy metal sound of the band's more popular albums.\nDave Holland left the band in 1989, and was replaced with the American Scott Travis - the first non British person to play for the band.\n90s.\nThe trial against the band.\nIn the summer of the year 1990, the band was involved in a trial where they were blamed for causing two young men to try to kill themselves. These men were 20-year-old James Vance and 18-year-old Raymond Belknap, both American. On 23 December 1985, Vance and Belknap, after hours of drinking beer, smoking weed and apparently listening to Judas Priest, went to a playground at a church with a shotgun to kill themselves. Belknap died instantly after shooting himself, but Vance survived with a disfigured face. Vance died three years after.\nTheir parents thought they heard \"do it\" being sung in the band's song \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" from the Stained Class album (actually a cover of a Spooky Tooth song). They said the words in the song made them shoot themselves. The trial was dismissed in August of 1990 when Rob Halford played a clip from their song called Exciter in reverse, so it sounded like Halford was singing \"I asked her for a peppermint, I asked her to get one\" (the actual words were \"Stand by for exciter, salvation is his task\"). He did this to show how any reverse messages in their songs suggesting suicide were accidental.\nPainkiller and Halford leaves.\nThe band released one of their most popular albums in 1990 called Painkiller. The title song did very well and is a popular Judas Priest song. Fans and critics liked Scott Travis' fast and heavy drumming style, feeling it was better than the more simple slower drumming of Dave Holland.\nHalford wanted to make heavier music in the style of newer bands like Pantera, but the band wanted to carry on with the style they were playing. Halford and the rest of the band started arguing which led to his leaving of the band, starting new bands called Fight and 2wo.\nNew singer: Tim 'Ripper' Owens.\nThe band didn't play together for a few years, until 1996 when they found American singer Tim Owens, who nicknamed himself 'Ripper' after an early Priest song. Owens had been playing in a Priest tribute band before joining the actual band.\nThey released Jugulator in 1997. The album was a lot heavier and darker than Painkiller and had lyrics describing the end of the world. Reviews were negative about Owens' singing style and the heavier musical style.\n2000s.\nHalford and the band make up and Demolition.\nHalford and the rest of Judas Priest started speaking again after KK, Glenn and Ian were invited to a wedding of a relative of Halford's. KK and Ian attended and made up with Halford.\nHowever, Tim Owens was still in the band until 2003, bringing out Demolition in 2001. The album has a larger variety of musical styles than Jugulator, but was no more successful.\nHalford re-joins.\nTheir next album was Nostradamus in 2008, which was a concept album (an album telling a story) about a prophet, also called Nostradamus. Reviews were more critical, with negativity towards the album's length of two discs.\nModern Era.\nEpitaph tour and new album.\nAround 2010, media reported that the band planned to break up after one last tour. However, eventually, the band confirmed that they would not be breaking up after the tour but would be doing a lot less touring. K.K. Downing left the band in 2011, after 41 years. He was replaced by Richie Faulkner.\nDuring the tour, the band played at least one song from every studio album apart from the two with Ripper Owens.\nThe band made a new album after the tour called \"Redeemer of Souls\", which came out in 2014. The band are still touring although their tours will not last as long due to the elderly ages of some of the band members."}

In 1975 he had his first number one song, as a singer, on Billboard's Hot Country Songs music chart.\nEarly life.\nWillie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas on April 29, 1933, during the Great Depression to Myrle Marie (n\u00e9e Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson. He was born on April\u00a029,\u00a01933, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April\u00a030. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. Nelson's ancestry includes English, Irish, and Cherokee. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Nelson's grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic. His mother left soon after he was born, and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, and when he was nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson didn't like picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age thirteen, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.\nPersonal life.\nNelson is the co-chair of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advisory board."}

{"id": "11599", "revid": "618550", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11599", "title": "Carbon dioxide", "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a chemical compound and is acidic. It is a gas at room temperature. It is made of one carbon and two oxygen atoms. People and animals release carbon dioxide when they breathe out. Also, every time something organic is burnt (or a fire is made), it makes carbon dioxide. Plants use carbon dioxide to make food. This process is called photosynthesis. The properties of carbon dioxide were studied by the Scottish scientist Joseph Black in the 1750s.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat energy. Greenhouse gases change the climate and weather on our planet, Earth. This is called climate change. Greenhouse gases are a cause of global warming, the rise of Earth surface temperature.\nIts concentration in Earth's atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by photosynthetic organisms and geological phenomena (mainly volcanos).\nBiological role.\nCarbon dioxide is an end product in organisms that obtain energy from breaking down sugars, fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism. This is a process known as cellular respiration. This includes all animals, many fungi and some bacteria. In higher animals, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the lungs where it is breathed out. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to use in photosynthesis.\nDry ice.\nDry ice, or solid carbon dioxide, is the solid state of CO2 gas below -109.3\u00a0\u00b0F (-78.5\u00b0C). Dry ice does not occur naturally on earth but is man made. It is colorless. People use dry ice to make things cold, and to make drinks fizzy, kill gophers, and freeze warts. The vapor of dry ice causes suffocation and eventually, death. Caution and professional assistance is recommended whenever dry ice is in use.\nAt usual pressure it will not melt from a solid to a liquid but instead changes directly from a solid to a gas. This is called sublimation. It will change directly from a solid to a gas at any temperature higher than extremely cold temperatures. Dry ice sublimates at normal air temperature. Dry ice exposed to normal air gives off carbon dioxide gas that has no color. Carbon dioxide can be liquified at pressure above 5.1 atmospheres.\nCarbon dioxide gas that comes off of dry ice is so cold that when it mixes with air it cools the water vapour in the air to fog, which looks like a thick white smoke. It is often used in the theater to create the appearance of fog or smoke.\nIsolation and production.\nChemists can get carbon dioxide from cooling air. They call this air distillation. This method is inefficient because a large amount of air must be refrigerated to extract a small amount of CO2. Chemists can also use several different chemical reactions to separate carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is made in the reactions between most acids and most metal carbonates. For example, the reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) makes carbon dioxide:\nThe carbonic acid (H2CO3) then decomposes to water and CO2. Such reactions cause foaming or bubbling, or both. In industry, such reactions are used many times to neutralize waste acid streams.\nQuicklime (CaO), a chemical that has widespread use, can be made heating limestone to about 850\u00a0\u00b0C. This reaction also makes CO2:\nCarbon dioxide is also made in the combustion of all carbon-containing fuels, such as methane (natural gas), petroleum distillates (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, propane), coal or wood. In most cases, water is also released. As an example the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen is:\nCarbon dioxide is made in steel mills. Iron is reduced from its oxides with coke in a blast furnace, producing pig iron and carbon dioxide:\nYeast metabolizes sugar to produce carbon dioxide and ethanol, also known as alcohol, in the production of wines, beers and other spirits, but also in the production of bioethanol:\nAll aerobic organisms produce when they oxidize carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins in the mitochondria of cells. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. (They include cellular respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis). Photoautotrophs (i.e. plants, cyanobacteria) use another reaction: Plants absorb from the air, and, together with water, react it to form carbohydrates:\nCarbon dioxide is soluble in water, in which it spontaneously interconverts between CO2 and (carbonic acid). The relative concentrations of , and the deprotonated forms (bicarbonate) and (carbonate) depend on the acidity (pH). In neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH &gt; 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (&gt;50%) becoming the most prevalent (&gt;95%) at the pH of seawater, while in very alkaline water (pH &gt; 10.4) the predominant (&gt;50%) form is carbonate. The bicarbonate and carbonate forms are very soluble. So, air-equilibrated ocean water (mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2\u20138.5) contains about 120\u00a0mg of bicarbonate per liter.\nIndustrial production.\nIndustrial carbon dioxide is produced mainly from six processes:\nChemical reaction.\nCarbon dioxide can be created with a simple chemical reaction:"}

{"id": "11603", "revid": "420456", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11603", "title": "Black Death", "text": "The Black Death was an outbreak of disease that killed millions of people across Europe and Asia. Most people think that the disease was the bubonic plague. Around 50 million people were killed by the bubonic plague, and was at its worst between 1347 and 1351. The disease may have started in Asia. This disease is carried and spread by fleas living on rats. Traders from the Silk Road may have brought the infected fleas to Europe.\nFleas started the problem; the infected fleas were carried by black rats. Rats that were carrying the fleas would go into cities. When the fleas bit somebody, they would inject a little bit of the bacteria into the wound. This would cause the person to be infected. Rats were often on ships. This meant the disease spread extremely quickly, all over Europe.\nIn humans, the disease caused swelling in the groin, under the arms and behind the ears. These swellings were a black and purple colour, hence the name 'The Black Death'. The dark swellings were called buboes. People were in pain and victims died a horrible death. The symptoms could be seen 3\u20137 days after victims were bitten by a flea carrying the disease.\nImpact.\nThe disease killed around a third of Europe's population, with variation between areas. It killed at least 75-200 million people across Europe, the Middle East, India, and China.\nThe same disease is thought to have returned to Europe every generation with different degrees of intensity and fatality until the 1700s. Later outbreaks include the Italian Plague of 1629-1631, the Great Plague of London (1665\u20131666), the Great Plague of Vienna (1679), the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720\u20131722 and the 1771 plague in Moscow. In its virulent form it seems to have disappeared from Europe in the 18th century.\nThere is some controversy over the identity of the disease. Anthrax and Viral hemorrhagic fevers are other ideas for what specific disease the Black Death might have been.\nThe Black Death had a very big effect on Europe's population. It changed Europe's social structure. It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as Jews, Muslims, foreigners, beggars and lepers. The uncertainty of daily survival influenced people to live for the moment, as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in \"The Decameron\" (1353).\nThe initial fourteenth-century European event was called the \"Great Mortality\" by contemporary writers and, with later outbreaks, became known as the 'Black Death'.\nMedia.\nThe Black Death has been used as a subject or as a setting in modern literature and media. \nEdgar Allan Poe's short story The Masque of the Red Death (1842) is set in an unnamed country during a fictional plague that bears strong resemblance to the Black Death.\nAlbert Camus uses this theme too. His novel, \"The Plague\" (1947) is set against an outbreak of the plague in Algeria and how people handle it. \nMedical aspects.\nSufferers of the bubonic plague develop fevers, severe flu symptoms and buboes that could swell to the size of an average apple. These buboes appear mainly in the groin, armpit and apparently sometimes on the thighs. The buboes were not only large but also were filled with pus and turned a purple color.\nThe medical knowledge of the time was based on Hippocrates' theory of humorism. This said the body consists of different fluids. If they are in harmony, the person is healthy. If they are not, disease results. Very often, diseases were also seen as a punishment of God.\nSuch a theory can of course not account for the spreading of a disease from one person to another one. Infection was said to occur from bad winds (called \"Miasma\"). The bad air could also come from within the earth, and thereby cause the disease. Remedies against the disease included to only open windows towards the north, to not sleep during the day, and not to work too hard.\nThe Faculty of Medicine of the University of Paris concluded that the Black Death was caused by a bad conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars on 20 March, 1345. They had been asked by Philipp VI about the cause of the disease in 1348. Since the answer was scientifically founded, it was soon taken to be the real cause, and translated into many languages.\nTherefore, the doctors often limited their actions to telling people to go to Confession, so that their sins would be forgiven if they died. In the long run, the pandemics caused the doctors to change their ideas on how the human body worked, to get away from the theories of Hyppocrates and Galenos, more towards empirical science. Only 200 years later did Girolamo Fracastoro discover that diseases spread through infection."}

{"id": "11606", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11606", "title": "Serfdom", "text": "Serfdom is a legal and economic system.\nA serf is a worker who has to stay in a lords area. Serfs were the lowest social class of the feudal society. Serfs were different from slaves. Serfs could have property. In most serfdoms, serfs were legally part of the land, and if the land was sold, they were sold with it.\nSerfdom is the forced labour of serfs, on the fields of the land owners. Serfs got protection and the right to work on the leased fields. Serfs worked in fields, and other agricultural-related works, like forestry, transportation (both land and river-based), work in craft and even in manufacturing.\nSerfdom came from agricultural slavery of the Roman Empire and spread through Europe around the 10th century. Most people lived in serfdoms during the Middle Ages of Europe.\nIn England, serfdom lasted up to the 1600s, in France until 1789. In most other European countries serfdom lasted until the early 19th century. \nThe system of serfdom.\nAll land was owned by landowners - nobility, Church and monarchs. A serf is any peasant who has to do manual labor for someone else in order to get to keep his land. While most serfs were farmers, some serfs were craftsmen - like the village blacksmith, miller or innkeeper.\nThe serf's feudal contract.\nThe serfs had a feudal contract, just like a baron or a knight. A serf's feudal contract was that he would live on and work a piece of land held by his Lord. The serf would get protection in return.\nDuring that time, people said that a serf \"worked for all\", a knight or baron \"fought for all\" and a churchman \"prayed for all.\" Everyone had his place and all was right with God's world. The serf did not have as good a position as the knights or barons, but was better than slavery. Serfs had some rights in the feudal contract.\nA manorial Lord could not sell his serfs like Romans sold slaves. If his Lord sold some land, the serf of that land went with it to serve the new Lord. A serf could not leave his lands without permission. A serf could not sell his lands.\nBecoming a serf.\nA free man usually became a serf because he owed a large debt. He would make an agreement with the Lord of the land. The Lord would keep him safe, give money for his debt, and give him land to work on, and he would do work for the Lord. All his children would become serfs.\nThe serf's duties.\nThe usual serf \"paid\" his fees and taxes by working for the lord 5 or 6 days a week. At different times in the year he would do different things. A serf could plough his lord's fields, harvest crops, dig ditches, or repair fences. The rest of his time he could take care of his own fields, crops and animals.\nThe big problem for a serf was that he had to do the work for the Lord before he could do his own work. When his Lord\u2019s crops needed to be harvested, his needed to be harvested, too. The Lord would give them very good food when they worked for him.\nThe serfs also had to pay taxes and fees. The Lord decided how much taxes they would pay from how much land the serf had, usually 1/3 of their value. They had to pay fees when they got married, had a baby, or there was a war. Money was not very common then, so usually they paid by giving food instead of money.\nThere were strange tests to decide if something was good enough to be given for taxes. A chicken, for example, had to be able to jump over a fence. That showed that the chicken was young and healthy.\nBenefits of serfdom.\nA serf had some freedom. A serf could get and keep property and money. Some serfs had more money and property than their free neighbours. A serf could sometimes buy his freedom.\nAgricultural benefits.\nSerfs could grow what they wanted on their lands. Sometimes their taxes had to be paid in wheat, which is difficult to grow. They could take the wheat they did not give for taxes to the market. Mostly they were subsistence farming, eating what they grew. Their heirs usually got an inheritance.\nThe lord could not make the serfs leave his land unless he had good reasons. The lord was supposed to protect them from criminals or other lords, and he was supposed to give them charity during famines.\nVariations.\nThe rules for serfdom were different at different times and places. In some places, serfdom changed into different types of taxation.\nIn different places and times, serfs had to work different amounts. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 13th century it was 2 \u2013 3 days a year. In the 14th century, serfs had to work one day per week. They had to work 4 days per week in the 17th century. They had to work 6 days per week in the 18th century.\nSometimes, serfs were soldiers during war. They could get freedom or even ennoblement for bravery in war. In other cases, serfs could also purchase their freedom, be manumitted by their enlightened or generous owners, or flee to towns or newly settled land where few questions were asked. Laws varied from country to country: in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom.\nIn many cases, serfs had to get permission from their lord to marry someone who was not a serf for that lord.\nSometimes a serf had to pay money because of something he had done. This is called a fine. A serf had to pay a fine when he inherited money or property. He had to pay a fine if he became a priest or monk. A serf had to pay a fine if his children went to the city instead of staying and being a serf. Serfs had to give their best animal to their lord when they died, so that their children would get to stay on the land.\nSerfs had to pay to use the lord\u2019s grain mill and bread oven. They had to pay to use the lord\u2019s carts to carry their produce. The serfs were very angry about that. Many peasants had to pay a fine because they used their own grain mill. The miller charged a fee called (multure), which was usually 1/24 of the total grain milled. The serfs often thought the millers were not honest. Many lords made the serfs use the lord's oven to bake their daily bread.\nFreedom for the serfs.\nSerfdom began to change because barter became less important as money was used more. Lords could make money by renting the land. Many Lords \"freed\" their serfs when their work was less valuable than money.\nStill, the serfs' lives were not seriously changed; they still had to farm their land, take care of their families and pay their taxes. The main difference was that they could be forced off their lands if they did not pay the rent, or if their Lord decided he wanted to use their fields for raising sheep (for example) rather than corn. Even though the serfs were \u201cfree\u201d, their life was often harder.\nSerfs in antiquity.\nThe helots in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta and the peasants working on government lands in ancient Rome worked like serfs, but they did not use that name. They were called coloni, or \"tenant farmers\u201d. When Germanic tribes took over the Roman Empire they took the lands from the wealthy Romans. They became the new lords of the same economic system of serfdom.\nBeginning of serfdom.\nThe serfdom of medieval times began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century. This empire had ruled most of western Europe for more than 200 years. It was followed by a long time when there were no strong central governments in most of Europe.\nDuring this time, feudal lords worked to make serfdom the common way for people to live. Serfdom was the system where great landlords could make sure other people worked to feed them and are forced, legally and economically, to keep doing that.\nThis system gave most of the agricultural labor during the Middle Ages. There was slavery during the Middle Ages, but it was not common. Usually they were only slaves to take care of people\u2019s houses. Parts of Europe, including much of Scandinavia, never used serfdom or other feudal institutions.\nEnd of serfdom.\nIn the later Middle Ages serfdom began to go away west of the Rhine even as it grew in Eastern Europe. This was one important cause for the deep differences between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe.\nIn Eastern Europe, the rise of powerful monarchs, towns, and an improving economy weakened the manorial system through the 13th and 14th centuries. Serfdom was not common after the Renaissance.\nSerfdom in Western Europe mostly ended in the 15th and 16th centuries. This was because of changes in the economy, population, and laws about what lords could make their tenants do in Western European nations. The end of serfdom in England around 1600 conincides approximately with the start of chattel slavery in the English-speaking parts of the Western hemisphere.\nAt the same time, there were more protests by serfs and peasants, like Wat Tyler\u2019s Rebellion in England in 1381. This put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to change the system and make it better. The new ways of renting the land gave people more freedom.\nThe Industrial Revolution helped end serfdoms. Farmers wanted to move to towns to make more money than working in the fields. Land owners also put their money into industries that made more money for them. This caused urbanization.\nSerfdom reached Eastern European countries later than Western Europe. It became the main way around the 15th century. Before that time, Eastern Europe had fewer people than Western Europe. The lords of Eastern Europe tried to make people want to move there from Western Europe. Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the Black Death epidemics. That stopped the people moving to Eastern Europe, and many people who were already there died.\nSerfdom in Russia.\nThere was still serfdom in Russia until February 19, 1861. In Russian Baltic provinces it ended in the beginning of 19th century (Russian Serfdom Reforms). Russian serfdom was different than in other Eastern European countries, because it was not changed by German law and people coming from Germany. The serfdom and manorialism systems were forced by the crown (Tsar), not the nobility.\nReturn of serfdom.\nSome people say that planned economies, especially those based on Soviet-style Communist economics, such as the Soviet collective farm system, are government-owned serfdom. Friedrich Hayek said that in his book \"The Road to Serfdom\". \nMikhail Gorbachev grew up in a kolkhoz. They were supposed to be collectives. There were also sovkhoz which were state-owned. The government used a system of internal passports and household registration (such as China's hukou system) to make people stay on their farms. They had to plant crops according to instructions from the central authorities, especially if they were on state-run farms. The state then bought their agricultural produce at low prices and invested heavily in industrialization. Gorbachev said this was much like being a serf. \nThis kind of serfdom lasted in Russia until 1974 (with a brief break during the Civil War). USSR Government Decree #667 gave peasants identification documents, with an unrestricted right to move within the country. This was the first time in Russian history that had happened. It is possible that a system like this still is happening in rural China."}

Fungi have thin thread-like cells called \"hyphae\" that absorb nutrients and hold the fungus in place. Some, such as mushrooms, also have a body containing many cells. Fungi do not have chlorophyll to capture energy from sunlight as plants do. Instead, they are nourished by digesting dead organic matter around them and absorbing it. The study of fungi is called \"mycology\".\nThe fungi are a separate kingdom of living things, different from animals and plants.\nThe cells of fungi have nuclei, unlike the cells of bacteria. Hyphae sometimes have many nuclei. Their cell walls contain chitin, unlike the cell walls of plants, which contain cellulose. These and other differences show that the fungi form a single group of related organisms. The group for fungi is called the \"Eumycota\" or\" Eumycetes\". They share a common ancestor, which makes them a monophyletic group.\nFungi are \"saprophytic\": a fungus breaks down dead organic matter around it, and uses it as food. It absorbs the molecules of food through its cell wall.p107 Some fungi are parasitic or symbiotic.\nFungi reproduce sexually and asexually in several different ways. Many fungi make spores that grow into new fungi. \nFungi came into existence about 1000 million years ago. They are found in fossils from the Devonian period, and they are probably much older. They are hard to find in older fossils because they decay rapidly. \nStructure.\nReproduction.\nFungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. Some fungi grow mushrooms: these are fruiting bodies. Under the cap there are gills; the gills bear spores that will disperse, and may develop into new fungi. Otherwise, fungi use a sporangium to bear asexual spores by mitosis, or sexual spores by meiosis. The spores are haploid.\nFungi may be single celled or multicellular. Yeast is single-celled, and reproduces either sexually or asexually. Asexual reproduction occurs by simple budding (binary fission).\nMycelium.\nThe mycelium is the vegetative (non-reproductive) part of a fungus. It is usually underground (or inside some other substance), and made of filaments called hyphae (singluar: \"hypha\"). \nHyphae.\nHyphae look like threads or tiny roots. The mycelium is a mat of hyphae that may be very thickly woven. The fungus uses them to extract nutrients. Each hypha is a long cell inside a tube-shaped cell wall that grows from the end. \nHyphae are usually syncytia. This means the cell walls (septa) are mostly not complete, and the cell nuclei are not separated from each other as in normal cells. Details differ between species.\nSymbiosis.\nSymbiosis means living together. Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or bacterium. In this partnership the algal cells live inside the fungus tissue. The end result is a new mat-like life-form which clings to rock and other surfaces. About 20% of all fungi live as part of a lichen.\nAnother important kind of symbiosis is mycorrhiza. This is when a fungus lives inside plant roots; most trees have mycorrhizal roots, and so do many crop plants. Both the fungus and the plant benefit in this arrangement.\nPathogens.\nSome fungi cause crop diseases; others cause serious disease in humans. Some are highly poisonous: never eat a mushroom picked in the wild unless you know what you are doing."}

Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made is also called a \"pottery\" (plural \"potteries\"). Pottery also refers to the art or craft of a potter or the making of pottery. A dictionary definition is simply clay fired in a kiln. \nPottery objects are made from damp clay mixed with other materials. They are then fired in a special oven called a kiln at high temperatures. Firing makes the clay hard. The potter may then apply a glaze to the surface before firing the object again. The fired glaze makes the surface of the pottery shiny, decorative and water-tight. \nSome potters make objects which are not useful and are really artistic objects or sculpture. Bare pottery objects without a glaze are called \"bisque\" or just earthenware. The finest pottery objects, made of porcelain or bone china are quite strong, yet are translucent.\nHistory of pottery.\nPottery originated before the Neolithic period. The earliest example we have is from eastern Europe, dating to 25,000 years ago or earlier. It is a female figurine known as the Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice, from a palaeolithic site in Moravia, Czech Republic. It may have been made as part of a fertility ritual. There are some similar figures from other nearby sites.\nSince the invention of agriculture, and the building of cities, containers for food and drink have been found at almost all archaeological sites.\nThe Potteries.\nThis means the area of Stoke-on-Trent in England, sometimes called the Staffordshire potteries. There were six towns, Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton, which now make up Stoke-on-Trent. \nThe area was the centre of the English pottery industry. The area had local supplies of clay, salt, lead and coal. Canals were used to transport the product inland. It was a large exporter of pottery for about 200 years: roughly from 1760 to about 1960. Plastic crockery after World War II and cheap ceramic production in China largely destroyed the Stoke pottery industry."}

He wrote music for the orchestra and for the piano. His music belongs to the Late Romantic period, but his later works sound quite modern, and he was influenced by Impressionism. He had some very unusual ideas about combining all the arts into one work.\nLife.\nScriabin was the only child in a family which had an aristocratic background. He was always proud of having been born on Christmas Day (6 January is Christmas Day in the Russian Orthodox church). His mother died when he was a year old and his father spent most of his time abroad working as a diplomat. He was looked after by his aunt, grandmother and great-aunt, all of whom fussed over him so that he was a very spoilt child. When he grew up he was very short and his hands could only just stretch one octave (eight notes) on the piano.\nScriabin was educated in the Moscow Cadet Corps. He learned to play the piano and became friends with the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff who was just one year younger. He won the second gold medal ever to be awarded at the Moscow Conservatoire (Rachmaninoff had won the first one). He practised a piece called \"Islamey\" by Balakirev but damaged his right hand doing it. He still managed to continue his career as a pianist, but he wrote a few piano pieces for the left hand only. In 1895 he toured through many countries in Europe giving concerts and composing a lot of piano music. He married in 1897. He went with his wife to Odessa where he played his Piano Concerto and then spent several months in Paris. He taught at the Moscow Conservatoire and wrote some important orchestral music. Later he left his wife and children and went to Europe for several years with another woman. She inspired a lot of his music. Scriabin continued to travel and play the piano until the end of his life. When he was in London in 1914 he had a boil on his lip, which got steadily worse until he died a year later.\nHis music.\nScriabin liked the music of Chopin and he wrote a lot of short pieces called Preludes which show Chopin\u2019s influence. As he got older his music became more and more personal. He was very egocentric (thought only about himself and not about other people) and he had some strange ideas.

He wrote \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", and the plays \"Salom\u00e9\", \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", \"An Ideal Husband\", and \"Lady Windermere's Fan\".\nWilde was bisexual. He was married, and had two children. His downfall came as a result of his affair with a younger man, Lord Alfred Douglas.\nBiography.\nWilde, born in Ireland in 1854, was an outstanding classical scholar at Trinity College, Dublin, then at Magdalen College, Oxford University. In London, he worked as a journalist for four years. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant clothes, and glittering conversation, Wilde was one of the best known personalities of the day. It was his only novel, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", which brought him full recognition. Then he turned to writing drama. He wrote \"Salom\u00e9\" in French in Paris in 1891, but it was refused a licence. Despite this, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London.\nAt the height of his fame and success\u2014his masterpiece, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", was still on stage in London\u2014Wilde sued his lover's father for libel. After a series of trials, Wilde was convicted of gross indecency with other men and sentenced to two years of hard labour in Reading Gaol (jail). In prison he wrote \"De Profundis\", a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure.\nUpon his release he left immediately for France, never to return to the British Isles. There he wrote his last work, \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\", a long poem commemorating prison life. Living in a Paris hotel, he was destitute, with little money and few friends. His last memorable words were: \"My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go\".p546 He died of cerebral meningitis in Paris at the age of forty-six.\nWilde's wife, Constance Lloyd, changed the family name to Holland after his conviction, and took the children to Switzerland.\nThe affair.\nWilde's lover was the son of the Marquess of Queensbury, who was known for his outspoken atheism, brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing. Queensberry, who argued a lot with his son, confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred about the nature of their relationship. In June 1894, he visited Wilde at 16 Tite Street without an appointment, and said: \"If I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you.\"\nTrials.\n\"Wilde vs Queensberry\".\nOn the 18 February 1895, the Marquess left his calling card at Wilde's club, the Albemarle, inscribed: \"For Oscar Wilde, posing as a sodomite\".\nWilde, egged on by Douglas and against the advice of his friends, initiated a private prosecution against Queensberry, and had him arrested on a charge of criminal libel. As sodomy was then a crime, Queensberry's note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed a felony, forming the legal basis for libel charges. Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was, in fact, true.\nIn his opening speech for the defence, Counsel for Queensbury, Edward Carson, announced that he had found several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had sex with Wilde. On the advice of his lawyers, Wilde then decided to drop the libel prosecution against Queensberry. Queensberry was found not guilty, as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was \"posing as a sodomite\" was justified, \"true in substance and in fact\".\nUnder the Libel Act 1843, Queensberry's acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence, which left Wilde bankrupt.\n\"The Crown vs Wilde\".\nAfter Wilde left the court, a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Friends found Wilde at a hotel; they advised him to go to Dover and try to get a boat to France. His mother advised him to stay and fight like a man. Wilde was duly arrested and then imprisoned on remand at Holloway, where he received daily visits from Douglas.\nEvents moved quickly. His prosecution opened on the 26 April 1895 and Wilde pleaded not guilty. He had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris, and Douglas fled to the Hotel du Monde. Under cross examination Wilde was at first hesitant, then spoke eloquently:\nCharles Gill (prosecuting): \"What is \"the love that dare not speak its name?\"\"\nWilde: \" 'The love that dare not speak its name' in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art, like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as 'the love that dare not speak its name', and on that account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man, when the older man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it, and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it\".\nThis response was, however, counterproductive in a legal sense as it only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour. The trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. Wilde's counsel, Sir Edward Clark, was finally able to agree bail. The Reverend Stewart Headlam put up most of the \u00a35,000 bail, having disagreed with Wilde's treatment by the press and the courts. Wilde was freed from Holloway and, shunning attention, went into hiding at the house of Ernest and Ada Leverson, two of his firm friends. Edward Carson approached Frank Lockwood (QC) and asked \"Can we not let up on the fellow now?\"p435 Lockwood answered that he would like to do so, but feared that the case had become too politicised to be dropped.\nAt the final trial, Wilde and Alfred Taylor were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years' hard labour. The judge described the sentence as \"totally inadequate for a case such as this\", although it was the maximum sentence allowed for the charge under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885. Wilde's response \"And I? May I say nothing, my Lord?\" was drowned out in cries of \"Shame\" in the courtroom.\nBibliography.\nProse\nPlays.\nDates are dates of first performance."}

His parents, Garvin and Gwenda Evans, are Welsh. When he was one, his family moved to County Dublin, Ireland. There, he attended St. Andrew's National School. He received piano and guitar lessons with his brother, Dik Evans. At Mount Temple Comprehensive School, they both answered an advertisement posted by Larry Mullen Jr. wanting musicians to form a band. The band accepted both of them. This band went through several major changes before emerging as U2 in March 1978. Dik Evans left the band just before the name change. U2 began performing in various venues in Ireland and eventually began developing a following. Their first album, \"Boy\", was released in 1980.\nIn 1981, Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he was persuaded to stay.

He signed the Revenue Act of 1932, which was a large tax increase. He also signed the largest tariff (a tax on goods that are traded between foreign countries and the United States) increase in American history which worsened the Great Depression, even though 1000 economists warned him not to sign that.\nHoover denied giving promised retirement money to poor World War 1 veterans (called the Bonus Army) earlier than what was agreed to, so they went on strike.

Garfield", "text": "James Abram Garfield (November 19, 1831\u2013 September 19, 1881) was an American politician. He was the 20th president of the United States from March to September 1881. Before he became president, he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1863 to 1881. \nHe was the second president to be assassinated (killed while in office). Four months into his presidency, on July 2, he was shot. For almost half that time he was bedridden as a result of that attempt to kill him. He died on September 19, 1881.\nEarly life.\nGarfield was born in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio. His father died in 1833, when James Abram was 18 months old. He grew up cared for by his mother and an uncle.\nEducation.\nIn Orange Township, Garfield attended school, a predecessor of the Orange City Schools. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named Hiram College] in Hiram, Ohio. He then transferred to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he was a brother of Delta Upsilon. He graduated in 1856 as an outstanding student who enjoyed all subjects except chemistry. He then taught at the Eclectic Institute. He was an instructor in classical languages for the 1856-1857 academic year, and was made principal of the Institute from 1857 to 1860.\nPersonal life.\nOn November 11, 1858, he married Lucretia Rudolph. They had seven children (five sons and two daughters): Eliza A. Garfield (1860-63); Harry A. Garfield (1863-1942); James R. Garfield (1865-1950); Mary Garfield (1867-1947); Irvin M. Garfield (1870-1951); Abram Garfield (1872-1958); and Edward Garfield (1874-76). One son, James Rudolph Garfield, followed him into politics and became Secretary of the Interior under President Theodore Roosevelt. Garfield could write in Greek with his left hand and Latin with his right hand at the same time.\nCareer.\nGarfield decided that the academic life was not for him and studied law privately. He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1860. Even before admission to the bar, he entered politics. He was elected an Ohio state senator in 1859, serving until 1861. He was a Republican all his political life. He was a general in the American Civil War, and fought in the Battle of Shiloh and the Chattanooga Campaign.\nAssassination.\nGarfield became President on March 4, 1881 and was shot in Washington, D.C. on July 2. Garfield was shot in the back by Charles J. Guiteau at about 9:30 am. Guiteau helped Garfield's campaign for president, and then asked for a job when he won, but the president told him no. He was less than four months in term as the 20th President of the United States. Garfield died eleven weeks later on September 19, 1881, aged 49. The 31st Speaker of the United States House of Representatives James G. Blaine was at Garfield's side when he was shot down. At this time, it was not common for the president of the United States to have bodyguards, although Lincoln had protection during the civil war. \nVice President Chester A. Arthur became President when Garfield died. Guiteau was tried for murder, and many thought he would be found not guilty because he was insane. He was actually found guilty and hanged for the murder, reading a poem before he walked up the gallows. It is now believed Garfield was in fact killed because of his doctors, who stuck their fingers inside his wounds while treating him and causing a bad infection. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector, but failed because the bed was lined with steel wire (which he did not know). While Garfield was still alive, news of his condition was broadcasted across the country by telegraph, which was something new.\nIn a 2013 medical journal article, the historical record in regards to Garfield's assassination and death has been questioned, with the new argument being that the deterioration in President Garfield's condition from late July 1881 was actually caused by his doctors accidentally injuring and making a hole in his bladder, thus resulting in President Garfield getting cholecystitis."}

He was the first president who was a son of a president. Also, Adams was the first president to be photographed, instead of painted. \nAdams was a Federalist and served in the administrations of all the presidents that preceded him. He was Secretary of State under James Monroe, his predecessor as president. He began his service when he was just 27 in 1794 when he was named United States Minister to the Netherlands by President Washington. \nAdams led the fight against slavery in Congress. In 1838, at age 71, he spoke for the African slaves of the slave ship \"Amistad\". He won the case. He also challenged the constitutionality of the Gag Rule in Congress and saw through its removal in 1844 after an eight-year struggle against it. \nEarly life.\nHe was born in 1767 in Braintree, Massachusetts. As a child he watched the Battle of Bunker Hill, a fight of the American Revolutionary War, from his family's farm. When his father, John Adams, traveled to Europe, John Quincy went with him as his secretary. He became good at speaking other languages. Aside from English, he was also fluent in Latin and French, and had partial knowledge of Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Spanish, and Russian. \nEducation.\nHe went to Harvard College and became a lawyer. At age 26, he was appointed Minister to the Netherlands and then he went to Berlin. In 1802, he was elected to the United States Senate. Six years later, President James Madison appointed him as Minister to Russia.\nAs Secretary of State when James Monroe was President, Adams organized joint control of Oregon with the United Kingdom and helped get Florida from Spain. He also helped make the Monroe Doctrine.\nAbolitionist.\nIn the 1830s, slavery emerged as an increasingly polarizing issue in the United States. A longtime opponent of slavery, Adams used his new role in Congress to fight it, and he became the most prominent national leader opposing slavery. After one of his reelection victories, he said that he must \"bring about a day prophesied when slavery and war shall be banished from the face of the earth.\" He wrote in his private journal in 1820:\"The discussion of this Missouri question has betrayed the secret of their souls. In the abstract they admit that slavery is an evil, they disclaim it, and cast it all upon the shoulder of\u2026Great Britain. But when probed to the quick upon it, they show at the bottom of their souls pride and vainglory in their condition of masterdom. They look down upon the simplicity of a Yankee's manners, because he has no habits of overbearing like theirs and cannot treat negroes like dogs. It is among the evils of slavery that it taints the very sources of moral principle. It establishes false estimates of virtue and vice: for what can be more false and heartless than this doctrine which makes the first and holiest rights of humanity to depend upon the color of the skin?\"In 1836, partially in response to Adams's consistent presentation of citizen petitions requesting the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, the House of Representatives imposed a \"gag rule\" that immediately tabled any petitions about slavery. The rule was favored by Democrats and Southern Whigs but was largely opposed by Northern Whigs like Adams. \nIn late 1836, Adams began a campaign to ridicule slave owners and the gag rule. He frequently attempted to present anti-slavery petitions, often in ways that provoked strong reactions from Southern representatives. Though the gag rule remained in place, the discussion ignited by his actions and the attempts of others to quiet him raised questions of the right to petition, the right to legislative debate, and the morality of slavery. Adams fought actively against the gag rule for another seven years, eventually moving the resolution that led to its repeal in 1844.\nIn 1841, at the request of Lewis Tappan and Ellis Gray Loring, Adams joined the case of \"United States v. The Amistad\". Adams went before the Supreme Court on behalf of African slaves who had revolted and seized the Spanish ship \"Amistad\". Adams appeared on February 24, 1841, and spoke for four hours. His argument succeeded; the Court ruled in favor of the Africans, who were declared free and returned to their homes.\nPresidency.\nAdams was elected president by the United States House of Representatives after the 1824 United States presidential election gave nobody a majority of electoral votes. People who wanted Andrew Jackson to win said there was a deal between Adams and Speaker of the House Henry Clay; Adams had made Clay his Secretary of State.\nAdams passed law for U.S. improvements as part of what he called the \"American System.\" This means he created roads, canals, and used high tariffs, or taxes on imports. Among his proposals were the creation of a national university, a naval academy, and a national astronomical observatory. Adams fought Congress many times as many supporters of Andrew Jackson did not like his support of a national bank and tariffs.\nAdams lost the 1828 election to Jackson. The election was noted for the personal attacks made by the candidates against each other. \nLater life.\nAdams returned to Massachusetts for a short time after he was lost. He returned to Washington D.C. in 1831 after being elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was a leading opponent of slavery. He remained in Congress until the day of his death on February 23, 1848.\nDeath.\nOn February 21, 1848, Adams suffered a stroke in the House chamber. He collapsed and died in the House two days later on February 23, 1848. He was eighty years old. It was the 7th (and arguably the most significant) death of a US president. "}

It was first used in 1 January 45 BCE. It was the main calendar in most of the world, until Pope Gregory replaced that with the Gregorian calendar in 4 October 1582.\nDuring the 20th and 21st centuries, the date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days behind the Gregorian date.\nYear length; leap years.\nThe Julian calendar has two types of year: common years of 365 days and leap years of 366 days. There is a simple cycle of three common years followed by a leap year and this pattern repeats forever. However, the rule was not followed in the first years after the of the reform in 45 BCE. Due to a counting error, every 3rd year was a leap year instead of the 4th. The leap years were:\nHowever, in 8 BCE (746 AUC), emperor Augustus Caesar corrected the problem. The next leap year was 7 CE (160 AUC).\nCriticism.\nWith the simple cycle, the length of the Julian year is exactly 365.25 days (365 days and 6 hours), but the actual time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun once is closer to 365.2422 days (about 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds). This difference is about 365.25 - 365.2422 = 0.0078 days (11 minutes and 14 seconds) each year, although Greek astronomers knew that. This made the seasons get out of track, since the real first day of spring in western Europe (the equinox - day and night the same length) was happening earlier and earlier before the traditional 21 March as the centuries went by. By the 1500s, it was starting around 11 March, ten days 'too early' according to the calendar.\nReform.\nFrom Roman calendar.\nThe first step of the reform was to realign the 25 December with the Winter solstice by making 46 BCE (708 AUC) 445 days long. In ordinary Roman calendar, the common year had 355 days and the leap year (one year after the common year) had 378 days. The 46 BCE was a leap year, according to the calendar. Julius Caesar added 67 more days by adding two extra months (those are called \"Prior\" and \"Posterior\" in letters of Cicero) between November and December."}
{"id": "12159", "revid": "422286", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12159", "title": "Gregorian calendar", "text": "The Gregorian calendar is the calendar that is used throughout most of the world. It began being used in 1582. It replaced the previous Julian calendar because the Julian calendar had an error: it added a leap year (with an extra day every four years) with no exceptions. The length of the Julian year was exactly 365.25 days (365 days and 6 hours), but the actual time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun once is closer to 365.2425 days (about 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes). This difference is about eleven minutes each year.\nThis made the seasons get out of track, since the real first day of spring in western Europe (the equinox - day and night the same length) was happening earlier and earlier before the traditional March 21 as the centuries went by. By the 1500s, it was starting around March 11, ten days 'too early' according to the calendar. So what they did was to move the calendar forward ten days in 1582, and at the same time to make sure it did not happen again. To do this, they made an exception to the previous 'leap year rule' (add February 29 every four years). There would be no February 29 for every year that ends in 00 - unless it could be divided by 400. So the year 2000 was a leap year, because it could be divided by 400, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 would be common years, with no February 29.\nIt was first suggested by the Neapolitan doctor Aloysius Lilius, and was made official by Pope Gregory XIII, for whom it was named, on February 24, 1582. The official change took place the following October, when Thursday, 4th was followed by Friday, 15th.\nMonths.\nThe months of the Gregorian calendar year are, in order:\nIf February has 28 days, then the year is 365 days long.\nIf February has 29 days, then the year is called a \"leap year\" and it is 366 days long. A leap year usually happens once every four years. The most recent leap year was 2020, and the next leap year is 2024.\nAdoption.\nNot every country started using the new calendar immediately. Spain, Portugal, and Italy started to use the new calendar on Friday, October 15, 1582, following Julian Thursday, October 4, 1582. In Europe's Protestant countries, people feared that the new calendar was an attempt by the Catholic Church to silence their movement. The England and the rest of the British Empire adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752; by which time it was necessary to correct by \"eleven\" days (Wednesday, September 2, 1752 being followed by Thursday, September 14, 1752).\nRussia.\nIn the USSR, the October Revolution of 1917 was celebrated in November. In 1917 the Russian Empire still used the old Julian calendar. Changing the calendar meant 365 days after the revolution started was now in November 1918.\nChurches.\nIn 1923 some Eastern Orthodox Churches changed to the Gregorian calendar. Christmas Day is the same as the Catholic and Protestant churches, but the date of Easter continues to be worked out differently.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church, as well as some other Eastern Orthodox Churches such as Georgian and Serbian, did not want this change, so Russian Christmas Day is about two weeks after the rest of Europe.\nJapan.\nJapan adopted the Gregorian calendar's way of working out leap years on January 1, 1873, but the months have numbers instead of names. Japan also starts year one with each new reign, but uses reign names not the name an emperor might be best known by in the west. For example, the reign names \"Meiji\" year 1=1868, \"Taisho\" 1=1912, \"Showa\" (Emperor Hirohito) 1=1926, \"Heisei\" (Emperor Akihito) 1=1989, and so on. The \"Western calendar\" (\u897f\u66a6, \"seireki\") using western year numbers, is also widely accepted by civilians and to a lesser extent by government agencies.\n\"Old Calendar\" in Britain.\nOld Style and New Style dates.\nSome old dates in Britain were written and documented with two different years. This is because Britain did not start a new year until March 25, so for a few months it was one year in Britain and the next year in other countries.\nThe letters OS (for \"Old Style\") and NS (for \"New Style\") were used to help determine the year being used. For example, King Charles I died on January 30, 1649. In \"Old Style\" it is correct to say that Charles I died \"January 30, 1648 (OS)\". Using \"New Style\", as we determine dates now, the correct date and year would be February 9, 1649.\nBritish Tax.\nIn the old calendar the year started on March 25. This became April 5, and was used as the first day of the year for working out taxes and rents. Taxes and rents went on using the old way of working out leap years so in 1800 the year started on April 6. But it was not changed in 1900, so the tax year in the United Kingdom still begins on April 6.\nTimeline.\nPeople sometimes use the term N.S. or New Style to mean the Gregorian calendar, with Old Style (or O.S.) meaning the Julian calendar."}

Someone who practices Sufism is called a Sufi, and may be a \"Dervish\" or a \"Fakir\".\nOrigins.\nAt first, Sufism only meant making Islam more personal and internal. Some say it first came from constantly reciting the Qur'an, meditating, and through experience. Others believe that Sufism is trying to live as the Islamic prophet Muhammad did, to be closer to God. This is how the Prophet taught his disciples. Additionally, the Muslim conquests had brought large numbers of Christian monks and hermits, especially in Syria and Egypt, under Muslim rule. They believed in a deeply spiritual and mystical (even 'Platonic') way of life and many of their ways became part of early Sufism.\nSome of these teachings were summarized in texts (in Arabic initially). Important contributions in writing are attributed to Uwais al-Qarni, Harrm bin Hian, Hasan Basri and Sayid ibn al-Mussib, who are regarded as among the first Sufis in the earliest generations of Islam. Harith al-Muhasibi was the first one to write about moral psychology. Rabia Basri was a Sufi known for her love and passion for God, expressed through her poetry. Bayazid Bastami was among the first theorists of Sufism.\nSufism already had a long history when some teachers began to set up formal schools or orders (\"Tarika\" or \"Tariqah\") in the early Middle Ages. Almost all existing Sufi orders today trace their roots and chain of transmission (\"silsila\") back to Muhammad, via one of these orders.\nSufi ideas and principles.\nThe main idea in Sufism is that people can have 'personal knowledge' or oneness with God in their lives. In order to be one with God, you have to destroy your idea of yourself, or your ego. This is known as \"fanaa\" (annihilation). Apart from saying Sufi prayers, that vary according to different orders, you should be humble, considerate, and only act in order to control your desires.\nAfter \"fanaa\" is achieved, the you are reborn to live with, in, through and for God, (\"baqaa\", permanency). This is the state where you have achieved the divine love of God, and come ever closer to a unity with God. You should now strive to be one with God. A person who has crossed the various Sufi 'stages' and achieved this sort of mystic union with Allah, is called a \"Wali\" (a saint or friend of God) and the state is termed \"Wilayat\" (friendship/union).\nSufic Orders.\nIn Sufism there exist many different orders (\"tarikas\"), that were founded from the 12th and 13th centuries until today/contemporary times. Some of the major Sufi orders are:\nNotable Sufis.\nSome of the major, notable Sufis in history, from the 'classical age' of Sufism, include:\nModern practitioners, who have achieved the degree of \"sheikh\" (Master/Preceptor) and are accounted to have a high spiritual status, are still found in various places.\nSufism and Islamic orthodoxy.\nSufi practices are usually defined within the basic tenets of Islam, the \"Sharia\" (or \"Shariah\") although some orders include singing and dancing in the love of God, something some Muslims frown on. Hence some Muslims of a more orthodox mind-set believe that any actions outside the scope of \"Sharia\", or Sufi activities practised by non-Muslims are 'wrong'. However the underlying message and aim of the quest for the love of God is true for all humanity. For a non-Muslim the most important ideas in Sufism are love for fellow human beings (which reflects one's love of God) and living ones life in such a way where all actions are against the self. This automatically starts him on the path of \"fanaa\". In terms of discipleship and training, almost all the major Sufi orders are themselves quite willing to take students who are not Muslims.\nThere are some Muslim schools of thought, such as the Wahhabi for example, who oppose Sufism because they feel it obliterates the difference between God and man and bypasses the common method of salvation as prescribed by their interpretations of \"Sharia\". Although there are non-Islamic versions of Sufism too (generally defined as 'Universal Sufism') puritanical and rigid people in Islam tend to view them with considerable hatred and anger. As a result, we often see a great deal of misunderstanding and conflict regarding Sufism and Sufic practices.\nHistorically speaking, orthodox Islam, especially fundamentalist groups like the Wahhabi and Salafi have been the most intolerant and violent against what they think of as 'Deviant Sufism'. In the past centuries, severe persecution has been carried out by them against the Kharijites, the Ismaili Shia cult (sometimes termed the 'Assassins'), the Ahmadiyya movement and several other groups and individuals with Sufi-like mystical tendencies and practices. During the time of the later Mughal Empire in India, even the early \"gurus\" of Sikhism were persecuted by orthodox Islamic \"mullahs\" (theologians) since they had chosen to incorporate some of the ideas and poetic verses of the Sufi saint Baba Farid into their holy scriptures. In more recent times, over the last two decades, considerable persecution has been made of the spiritual reformer and sage Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi and his followers in Pakistan. He was opposed and threatened and forced to flee the country and his books banned there, and anyone publicly supporting him is liable to immediate arrest.\nEven proper, formal Sufi orders have suffered persecution for various reasons. In recent times the most notorious example was the outright banning of Sufism in Iran. This happened in spite of the famous \"Amman Message\", a joint declaration made by over 200 of the most noted moderate Islamic scholars in a conference in Amman, Jordan, in 2005, stressing that Sufism is very much 'part' of Islam.\nFurther reading.\nSome volumes for further reading on Sufism include:"}

In ornithology, \"dove\" tends to be used for smaller species and \"pigeon\" for larger ones. The wild ancestor of the domestic pigeon is the \"rock dove\". The feral pigeon is common in many cities. \nThere are more than 300 species in the family. They usually make nests of sticks, and their two white eggs are incubated by both the male and the female parent. Doves feed on seeds, fruit and plants. \nUnlike most other birds, the doves and pigeons produce a type of milk. It is produced in their crop, and called crop milk. Both sexes have this highly nutritious milk to feed their young.\nDistribution and habitats.\nPigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on Earth, except for the driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands and the high Arctic. They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands. They are in eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the Seychelles and R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe family has adapted to most of the habitats available on the planet. Doves may be arboreal or terrestrial or partly terrestrial. Species live in savannas, grasslands, deserts, temperate woodlands and forests, mangrove forests, and even the barren sands and gravels of atolls. Some species have large natural ranges. \nThe largest range of any species is that of the rock dove. This species lives in Britain and Ireland, northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia. The range of the species increased dramatically after it was domesticated, because the species went feral in cities around the world. It lives in cities across most of North America, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. \nThe species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man; several other species have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity. Other species have also increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes by humans.\nThe dodo and the solitaire.\nThe dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire are two famous flightless birds on the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar. They are extinct, but were alive before sailors found the islands. They had no fear of humans, whom they had never seen. The sailors hunted them, and killed them for food. Both species are now extinct. Animals introduced by man may also have hunted them. Their anatomy (osteology) and DNA sequence analyses show they were are in the Columbidae.\nAs a symbol.\nIn the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean, doves were used as symbols for the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, the Phoenician goddess Tanit, and the Roman goddesses Venus and Fortunata.\nThe Christian symbol of a dove with an olive branch in its beak represents peace and comes from Genesis 8:6 - 12, also John 1:32\u201334. The Christian stories came after very similar myths from earlier cultures.The Chaldean myth the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", Utnapishtim releases a dove and raven to find land; however, the dove merely circles and returns. Only then does Utnapishtim send forth the raven, which does not return, and Utnapishtim concludes the raven has found land.\nAs food.\nSeveral species of pigeons and doves are used as food, and probably any might be. The powerful breast muscles of the family make excellent meat. Domesticated or hunted pigeon were used as food in Mesopotamia, Ancient Rome and medieval Europe. It is familiar meat within Jewish, Arab, Assamese and French cuisines. According to the Tanakh, doves are kosher, and they are the only birds that may be used for a \"korban\" (offering). Other kosher birds may be eaten, but not brought as a \"korban\". It is also eaten in Asian cuisines, such as Chinese and Indonesian cuisine. Young pigeons in cuisine are known as \"squabs\".\nIn Europe, the wood pigeon is commonly shot as a game bird. Rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. The extinction of the passenger pigeon in North America was partly due to shooting for food. Mrs Beeton's \"Book of Household Management\" has recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, inexpensive food in Victorian industrial Britain."}

Grant (April 27, 1822\u2013July 23, 1885), born Hiram Ulysses Grant, was an American general who helped the Union Army of the United States win the American Civil War. He later became the 18th president of the United States (1869-1877).\nEarly life.\nHiram Ulysses Grant was born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio. He was the oldest of six children born to Jesse and Hannah Grant. Jesse Grant was a tanner. It was hard work, but he made a good living off of it. Young Grant worked for his father in the tannery but hated the work. He went to local schools. In 1838 he attended the Presbyterian Academy in Ripley, Ohio. In 1839 he was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He was not the best student though he was good at math. When he graduated, he was placed in the infantry.\nEducation and Influence.\nWhen Grant arrived at West Point and discovered that the academy had him registered under the wrong name as \"Ulysses S. Grant\". He was told that it didn't matter what he or his parents thought his name was, the official government application said his name was \"Ulysses S.\" and that application could not be changed. If \"Hiram Ulysses Grant\" wanted to attend West Point, he would have to change his name.\nPre-presidency.\nBefore becoming the president, Grant was an officer in the Union Army (North). He fought in the Mexican War and became a general at the start of the American Civil War. He served as head of the Army of Tennessee and won victories at Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga. He became the top general in the Union Army from 1864 to 1865, and fought several battles against Robert E. Lee.\nSince he was able to do well fighting in the American Civil War, he gained popularity which helped him to become the candidate for president of the Republican party. The Republicans were then the strongest party. Even though he was a respected general and supported civil rights for African Americans, historians criticize his presidency because he appointed his friends into high political positions and tolerated their corruption (even though Grant himself was innocent). Grant was the youngest president, only 46 years old, and the first to have both his parents attend his inauguration. He was also the first elected because of African American voters, who could vote then, although there was a big fight about it, which ended with many Black voters losing the right to vote. In his election, he won about 500,000 votes from African Americans, while the majority of white voters supported the Democratic candidate, who was called Horatio Seymour. Grant supported the right of Black men to vote because of this, but also because he thought it was right.\nPresidency.\nSecond term (1873\u20131877).\nIn 1872, Republican reformers split the party and nominated Horace Greeley to be president. The Democratic Party also nominated him. Greeley wanted Civil Service reform and amnesty for all former Confederates. Grant won the election by a landslide.\nVery soon into Grant's second term the Panic of 1873 started a depression in the United States that spread to Europe. In 1873, Republicans in Congress were caught in a bribery scandal by newspapers. They had collected large bribes to give large federal grants to the railroads. The bribes had taken place before Grant was president, but the news came out during his presidency making it seem even more corrupt. Also in 1873, Grant signed a bill that gave himself and congressmen a pay raise. The press attacked him for it calling it a money grab. Republicans were getting a bad reputation in the press. Mid-term, the Democrats won a majority of votes in the House. They started a number of congregational investigations. Grant's Secretary of the Treasury had to resign after being caught in a fraud scheme involving taxpayer kickbacks.\nThe Whiskey Ring was the largest scandal and involved widespread fraud. Grant had appointed an army friend John MacDonald as an Internal Revenue Service supervisor for the St. Louis area. In return for bribes, whisky distillers paid taxes only on a small portion of the whiskey they produced. They were cheating the U.S. government out of millions of dollars a year. MacDonald kept some of the money while some of it went to the Republican Party. The Whiskey Ring was paying some officials a regular salary to keep them from talking. Benjamin Bristow, the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, had no idea this was going on. Each time he sent inspectors on a raid to check out suspected cheaters, their records were always in good order. Bristow had no idea someone in his office was telling them in advance who was to be inspected. Meanwhile, Grant accepted expensive gifts from MacDonald not suspecting he was running a fraud scheme. MacDonald even told his friends in St. Louis that Grant was in on the scheme. In 1875, MacDonald and more than 350 distillers and government officials were indicted. This included Grant's personal secretary Orville Babcock. He was the one keeping ring members informed of any inspections. At his trial, witnesses lied and even President Grant wrote a letter stating Babcock was of good character. As a result, Babcock was exonerated of the charges, but the scandal prevented him from going back to his job in Washington. Of those accused, 60 paid fines while MacDonald and two others went to prison. The Whiskey Ring proved to most Americans that Grant's administration was filled with corruption.\nLater life and death.\nAfter his presidency, Grant was suffering from throat cancer. He made a long trip to Europe and tried to become president again in 1880. Nobody had been elected three times before and it was seen as wrong by many because George Washington had refused to. In the end, the Republican party agreed to nominate (propose) congressman James Garfield instead. But Grant kept many supporters in the party. One of them shot Garfield the same year, and killed him. Grant never became president again, however, and only one man has been elected three or more times, Franklin Roosevelt. Grant was the first one to try, however.\nDespite the problems during his second term, Grant was immensely popular, much like a modern-day movie star, and wrote a book about his life that sold millions of copies. He died three days after he finished writing it. He is buried with his wife Julia in Grant's Tomb, New York City, New York."}

The Diptera is a large order of advanced flying insects.\nTheir most obvious distinction from other insects is in their flight. A typical fly has two flight wings on its thorax and a pair of halteres. The halteres, which evolved from the hind wings, act as flight sensors: they are balance organs. Also flies have large eyes with excellent wide-angle vision.\nWith the help of their eyes and halteres, flies are exceptional fliers. They can avoid most predators, and are the most difficult insects to capture by hand. Their jinks, dives and turns to avoid their predators is their main adaptation. \"These flies do a precise and fast calculation to avoid a specific threat and they are doing it using a brain that is as small as a grain of salt\"... \"And they can fly like an ace at birth. It's like putting a newborn baby in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft and it knowing what to do\".\nThe only other order of insects bearing two true, functional wings plus any form of halteres are the Strepsiptera, a small order of insects. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera evolved their halteres from their front wings and their flight wings are their rear wings.\nThe presence of a single pair of wings distinguishes true flies from other insects with \"fly\" in their name, such as mayflies, dragonflies, damselflies, stoneflies, whiteflies, fireflies, sawflies, caddisflies, butterflies or scorpionflies.\nSome true flies have become secondarily wingless, including some that live in social insect colonies.\nFlies are also holometabolous, with complete metamorphosis.\nKinds of flies.\nThere are an estimated 1,000,000 species, although only about 150,000 species have been described.\nThere are many different kinds of flies. Scientists have named 85,000 kinds (species).\nSome flies do not have the word \"fly\" in their name, so people may not know they are flies. \nSome insects have the word \"fly\" in their names, but they are not flies at all."}

The disk made by the other short side is called the base, and the point of the axis which is not on the base is the cone's \"apex\" or \"vertex\". An object that is shaped like a cone is \"conical\".\nIn more technical terms, a cone is formed by a set of line segments, half-lines, or lines connecting a common point, the apex, to all of the points on a base that is in a plane that does not contain the apex. Depending on the author, the base may be restricted to be a circle, any one-dimensional quadratic form in the plane, any closed one-dimensional figure, or any of the above plus all the enclosed points. If the enclosed points are included in the base, the cone is a solid object; otherwise it is a two-dimensional object in three-dimensional space. In the case of a solid object, the boundary formed by these lines or partial lines is called the lateral surface; if the lateral surface is unbounded, it is a conical surface.\nIn the case of line segments, the cone does not extend beyond the base, while in the case of half-lines, it extends infinitely far. In the case of lines, the cone extends infinitely far in both directions from the apex, in which case it is sometimes called a double cone. Either half of a double cone on one side of the apex is called a nappe. The volume formula_1 of a cone is one third of the product of the area of the base formula_2 and the height formula_3"}

This mixture is quickly frozen while it is stirred continuously in a mixer,so that large ice crystals do not form. Some ice cream is made with carrageenan,a gum found in seaweed so that it is not sticky and easily eatable. Nowadays, ice cream comes with different flavors, shapes, colours and textures. It has a melting point of .\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIce cream was first eaten as early as 500 B.C in Persia. In the Achaemid Empire, an ancient Persian empire, ice cream was made of ice combined with flavorings. Just like modern ice cream, this type of ice cream is eaten during summer. In 400 BC, the Persians invented a special type of ice cream reserved to the royalty during summers. This type of ice cream is made of rose water and vermicelli. The ice in this particular ice cream was mixed with saffron, fruits, and various other flavors.\nIn 200 BC, the Chinese used a frozen mixture of milk and rice to make ice cream.\nGrowth.\nIce cream became very popular in the Mediterranean in the 1800s. Mediterranean people during the 1800s could easily afford ice cream. People started to make lots of recipes for ice cream.\nFrom the 1950s onward, ice cream became a lot more popular. Refrigeration was easily affordable because many people owned fridges that could store ice cream for a very long time without melting.\nPreparation.\nThere are lots of ways to make ice cream. Most people don't make ice cream, because it is easier to buy ice cream.\nShops make ice cream by mixing cream and other things like milk, sugar, and eggs. Then they add flavoring (something that adds flavor to a food). Then they freeze it.\nYou can also make ice cream by putting cream, milk, and sugar in a plastic bag. Then put ice and salt in a bigger bag. If you put the smaller bag inside the bigger bag, then shake it for 5-10 minutes, you get ice cream.\nHow people sell ice cream.\nPeople sell ice cream through many ways. You can buy ice cream in ice cream containers from supermarkets. You can also buy ice cream on a cone from an ice cream truck.\nTypes of ice cream.\nThere are many different flavors of ice cream. Ice cream often has things added to it for flavor, like chocolate chips, nuts, fruit, cookie dough, sweets, sauces or small candies.\nTraditionally, the three most common flavors are vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. There are ice cream flavors that are very similar, such as French vanilla, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, chocolate chip, and strawberry cheesecake. \nChocolate chips, or little pieces of dark or white chocolate, are a common addition to ice cream. Three common chocolate chip ice creams are chocolate chip (made with vanilla ice cream), mint chocolate chip or mint 'n chip (made with peppermint, spearmint, or creme de menthe ice cream), and chocolate chocolate chip. Peppermint ice cream without chips is also a common flavor.\nMany ice creams contain fruits. Besides strawberry, common fruit flavors are cherry, raspberry, blackberry, and peach. Some citrus fruits, such as orange and lime, are made into sherbets instead of ice cream.\nNut flavors include butter pecan, butter almond (both of which contain vanilla or caramel ice cream with nuts), pistachio, and peanut butter.\nCoffee (mocha, cappuccino, espresso) and caramel (English toffee, butterscotch, rum) are also common ice cream flavors.\nThere are many ice cream flavors that contain some mixture of chocolate, fudge, coffee, caramel, nuts, and marshmallows. The most common is Rocky Road (chocolate ice cream, nuts and marshmallows), but others include Mocha Almond Fudge (made with almond nuts, fudge, and coffee ice cream) and Tax Crunch (coffee, nuts, and malt powder)\nSome ice creams are a mixture of two or more ice creams. Neapolitan is a mixture of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry; while spumoni is a mixture of chocolate and various fruit flavors.\nOutside of the United States and Canada, flavors include dulce du leche (Mexico), macupino and lychee (both China)\nIce cream mixed with milk and often sugar and syrups is called a Milk Shake.\nMany ice cream parlors, such as Cold Stone Creamery, allow people to make something called a sundae, which is one or more flavors of ice cream mixed with things such as nuts, dark or white chocolate chips, bananas, cherries, pineapples, candies, cookies, marshmallows, and various syrups such as hot fudge, maple and butterscotch. Also, ice cream is often placed on a piece of pie, which is called \"pie a la mode\"."}

The blacksmith hammers hot iron on an anvil to change its shape. Blacksmiths make iron and steel tools.\nA smith is a person who works in metal. A blacksmith works with iron and steel. A thousand years ago, people only knew about seven metals (iron, gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and mercury). By color: gold is yellow; copper is red; and silver, tin, lead, and mercury are different gray colors. Iron is also a gray color if you shine it, but usually its surface is covered with a black oxide, which is a kind of rust. This black color forms very fast in a blacksmith's fire. The other metals have light colors, but iron is a dark color, so it is called the black metal in English. A smith who works the black metal is a blacksmith.\nA farrier works with iron like a blacksmith. The only ironwork a farrier does is to make horseshoes.\nForge.\nIron must be very hot to shape with a hammer. Hot iron becomes cold very soon. A blacksmith has only a few seconds to hammer a piece of iron, before it must be put back in the fire to become hot again.\nA forge is a special oven for metalworking. It burns coal or charcoal in a very hot fire. A bellows pushes air into the forge, to make the fire burn hotter. The blacksmith puts pieces of iron in the fire to make them hot and to keep them hot until they use it.\nWays to hammer iron.\nThere are a few ways to change a piece of iron's shape with hammer and heat. Here are the most important ways that a blacksmith uses:\nA punch is a tool like a short stick of iron. The end of the punch is flat.\nA chisel is a tool like a short stick of iron. The end of the chisel is sharp to cut. \nHard iron and steel.\nIron is one of the 92 natural elements.\nSteel is iron with a little carbon in it (0.3% to 1.7% carbon by weight).\nAll metals get harder when a smith hammers or bends them. This is called \"work-hardening\". If a smith hammers or bends a piece of metal that is already work-hardened, it will crack and break. To make work-hardened metal soft again, so that a smith can hammer and bend it more, the smith anneals the metal.\nTo \"anneal\" iron or steel, a blacksmith heats the metal until it no longer pulls a magnet, and then makes the metal become cold very slowly. Blacksmiths can cover the hot metal with sand, so that it takes hours to become cold. This makes iron or steel very soft.\nSteel acts just like iron, until a blacksmith \"heat-treats\" the steel. This is a special way to make the steel hot and then cold, so that the steel will become hard enough to keep a cutting edge (blade). A blade made from a piece of iron (instead of steel) will very soon become dull and will not cut. Good blades (for knives, chisels, axes, and other tools with cutting edges) are always made of steel, then heat-treated, and then sharpened.\nTo heat-treat steel, a blacksmith heats the steel until it no longer pulls a magnet, then makes the steel become cold very quickly. A blacksmith does this by putting the hot steel into a bucket of water and moving it around until it is cold. This is called \"quenching\". When this is finished, the steel will be as hard as it can be. This hardness can make it brittle, so if someone hits or drops it, it can break like glass.\nThe next step is to \"draw the temper\" or \"temper\" the steel, so that it will not break like glass. To temper steel, a blacksmith polishes a part of the steel so that it is smooth and shiny. The blacksmith then slowly heats the steel in the fire. When the steel is between , the polished steel will turn different colors. These colors do not glow in the dark; they look like dye on the polished steel. As the steel gets hotter from 300 to 650 degrees F, it will turn through the colors: yellow, then brown, then purple, then blue. Yellow means the steel will still be harder, blue means the steel will be softer (but still hard). When the steel turns the color that the blacksmith wants, he puts the steel into a bucket of water to stop the change. Different tools are tempered to different colors, but it also depends on how much carbon there is in the steel. Usually, stone chisels are tempered to yellow, and axes for trees are tempered to blue, but the blacksmith has to decide.\nA blacksmith does not hammer a blade edge thin. A blacksmith hammers the steel so that the edge stays thick. After the \"heat-treat\" and \"temper\", stones are used to grind the blade edge to make it sharp.\nIf a blacksmith has a piece of iron or steel, but does not know which one it is, the blacksmith can heat-treat it like steel. If it does not become hard, then it is not steel. Iron will show the same temper colors as steel, but it will not be hard.\nIf a blacksmith has an old steel tool, and wants to hammer it into a new different tool, the blacksmith anneals the steel. The steel will then be very soft like iron. The blacksmith can then hammer it into a new tool, and heat-treat and temper it, to make a new, hard steel tool.\nA blacksmith must be careful when hammering hardened steel or work-hardened iron, because small pieces can break off and fly, and these can hurt his or her eyes. Many blacksmiths wear plastic safety glasses to keep their eyes safe.\nHistory.\nThe first blacksmiths were Hittites. They started working iron to make tools around 1500 BC. The ways that tools are made by blacksmiths have changed very little since then.\nAround 1850, countries like the United States of America and the United Kingdom made new ways to make steel and tools in factories. Factories now make tools faster, and for less money than blacksmiths. There are now very few blacksmiths in countries that have a lot of factories.\nThe few blacksmiths that are still in countries with a lot of factories, make iron that is art. These blacksmiths make gates, stair rails, and chairs and tables for outdoors. People buy this iron as art, because each piece is different from the other pieces."}

He was President of Germany from 2004 to 2010. He was the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the CDU and the CSU, and the liberal FDP, for becoming President. K\u00f6hler was elected to his first five-year term by the Federal Assembly on 23 May 2004. He was reelected to a second term on 23 May 2009. About one year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the Bundeswehr in light of a visit to the troops in Afghanistan.\nK\u00f6hler is an economist by profession. Prior to his election as President, K\u00f6hler had a career in politics, the civil service and as a banking executive. He was President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1998 to 2000. He also served as the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2000 to 2004.\nAlthough the office of President is less influential than that of the Chancellor and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, K\u00f6hler was a highly popular politician during his term. He has called for more influence for the President and has suggested the President should be directly elected. This was the case under Germany's Weimar Constitution.\nEarly life.\nK\u00f6hler was born in Skierbiesz\u00f3w (later named Heidenstein), in the General Government area of German-occupied Poland. He was the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard K\u00f6hler. His family were Bessarabian Germans from R\u00ee\u015fcani in Romanian Bessarabia (near B\u0103l\u0163i, present-day Moldova). Horst K\u00f6hler's parents had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940. As part of the Generalplan Ost, they were resettled in 1942 at Skierbiesz\u00f3w. This was a village near Zamo\u015b\u0107, Poland (then part of the General Government). When the Wehrmacht was pushed back during World War Two, the K\u00f6hler family fled to Leipzig. In 1953, they left the Soviet Zone to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in refugee camps until 1957. Then, they settled in Ludwigsburg. Horst K\u00f6hler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee.\nStudies and military service.\nA teacher proposed that the refugee boy should apply for the Gymnasium. K\u00f6hler took his \"Abitur\" in 1963. After a two-year military service at a Panzergrenadier battalion in Ellwangen, he left the Bundeswehr as reserve officer. He studied and finally earned a doctorate in economics and political sciences from University of T\u00fcbingen. There, he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976.\nCareer in the civil service.\nK\u00f6hler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the Federal Ministry of Economics. In 1981, he was employed in the Chancellery of the state government in Schleswig-Holstein. He served there under Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. In 1982, K\u00f6hler was made head of the Ministers office in the Federal Ministry of Finance. He rose to head of department in 1987, with responsibility for financial policy and federal industrial interests. In 1989, he became head of the department for currency and credit.\nSecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.\nHe is a member of the CDU since 1981. He was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993. In that capacity, he served as a \"sherpa\" (personal representative) for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, preparing G7. He also served as the primary German negotiator in the Maastricht Treaty negotiations.\nCareer in banking 1993\u20132000.\nBetween 1993 and 1998 he served as President of the association of savings banks in Germany. In 1998, he was appointed president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He settled in London, where the headquarters of the bank is located.\nHead of the International Monetary Fund.\nK\u00f6hler was appointed managing Director and Chairman of the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2000. The government of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der nominated him. This was because their first nominee, Caio Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States.\nHe lived in Washington, D.C., from 2000 to 2004.\nPresident of Germany.\nOn 4 March 2004, K\u00f6hler resigned his positions, because he was nominated as presidential candidate. K\u00f6hler defeated Gesine Schwan on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580. 20 votes were cast for minor candidates, while one elector was absent because of a heart attack. K\u00f6hler succeeded Johannes Rau as President on 1 July 2004, for a five-year term. Germany's presidency is a largely ceremonial office. However, it is also invested with considerable moral authority. From 2004 until early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany. This was because Schloss Bellevue has been renovated.\nUpon his election, K\u00f6hler said that \"Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites\". Presenting his visions for Germany, K\u00f6hler also said that \"Germany should become a land of ideas\".\nIn July 2005, he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's request. Schr\u00f6der had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005.\nIn October 2006, he made a far-reaching decision by vetoing a bill. It would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration Deutsche Flugsicherung into private ownership. The Bundestag passed this legislation but as President, K\u00f6hler was authorized to not sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravenes the constitution. In December 2006, he did not sign the Consumer Information Law, because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills. In most instances less important legislation was involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history.\nIn his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, K\u00f6hler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector, stating that \"a minimum wage that can not be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs\".\nOn 22 May 2008, K\u00f6hler said, that he wants to be the candidate for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009, he was re-elected by the Federal Assembly, and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009.\nIn November 2009, K\u00f6hler refused to sign the \"Zugangserschwerungsgesetz\" (Access Impediment Act) into law without further information. The law, which aims to make it more difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with child pornography, is considered by many legal experts to be unconstitutional.\nResignation.\nOn 31 May 2010, K\u00f6hler announced his resignation as President of Germany. This came after German politicians criticised comments made by K\u00f6hler in relation to overseas military deployments:\nHe came under criticism for his statement that Germany\u2019s military missions abroad also served to secure trade. He afterwards stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. K\u00f6hler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favouring an unconstitutional position. After getting no support in the dispute, K\u00f6hler stepped down on 31 May 2010. He made a statement saying \"I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect.\" The resignation was considered a \"surprise\". The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position.\nAs written down in the German constitution, the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the Bundesrat, Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, until Christian Wulff was elected president on 30 June 2010.\nPersonal life.\nHorst K\u00f6hler is married to Eva K\u00f6hler, a teacher. They have two children, a daughter Ulrike (born in 1972) and a son Jochen (born in 1977). His daughter, who suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, became blind as a teenager. Horst K\u00f6hler is a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany."}

He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were still in high school. He first appeared in \"Action Comics\" issue #1 in 1938. Later, he appeared in movies, television series, cartoons, commercials, video games, and radio shows. Superman is one of the most popular superheroes, he is in the DC Comics. As a superhero he does not want to kill anyone. But he was forced to kill his enemy general Zod as Zod was about to kill people. Like other characters in the DC Universe, there have been several alternative versions of Superman over the years. Several actors have played Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Bud Collyer, Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tim Daly, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, and Tyler Hoechlin.\nSuperman's Real Life Origins.\nMr. Siegel imagined an evil villain who read minds and dreamed of conquering the world. He went by the name of the Superman. In the 1930s, Hitler, the infamous nazi villain from real life, was talking about getting rid of the Jews and communists. This was because he believed that Germans he called Aryans were supermen. Mr. Siegel, who was Jewish, found this disgusting. But one night, Mr. Siegel tossed and turned in his bed, and had a horrible time getting to sleep. When he awoke, Superman became the superman we know today, and the evil version disappeared. \nStory.\nSuperman was born on a planet called Krypton. His name was Kal-El. When his father, Jor-El, found out that their planet was going to explode, Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a spacecraft to save him. Kal-El was found and adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They named him Clark Kent. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called Smallville, Kansas in the United States. (There is a television series called \"Smallville\" about his time growing up there)\nAs he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is almost invulnerable (most things cannot hurt him). He is strong enough to lift almost anything and he can fly. Superman can also run and move faster than a bullet. He has X-ray vision (he can see through walls, he is not able to see through lead), and heat vision (shooting heat from his eyes). He can freeze things with his frost breath and his super-breath (which allows him to blow super hard). He decides to use his special powers to fight crime and save people in danger. He wears a blue and red costume and cape to keep his alter ego (his real name) a secret. He saves the entire world many times.\nSuperman moves to a city called Metropolis, and becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. He falls in love with another reporter, Lois Lane.\nHis weaknesses are radioactive rocks from his home planet that are called \"kryptonite\"; and magic. Sometimes his enemies use it to hurt him. Diffferent Kryptoinites have different effects on him, Blue Kryptonite makes people able to control him using hypnosis, green weakens his powers and slowly kills him, black makes him evil, and red has many different effects on him (each piece of red kryptonite affects him differently). There is also gold, white, and jewel kryptonite. Some of Superman's enemies use magic to hurt him.\nAffiliations.\nEnemies.\nHis most well known arch enemy is a bald (hairless), evil genius named Lex Luthor. He has other deadly enemies too. Bizarro is a failed duplicate of superman. Darkseid is a very powerful enemy, and the ruler of the planet Apokolips. Another enemy includes General Zod who comes from the same planet as Superman.\nTeams.\nSuperman also founded the Justice League of America alongside Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, and Martian Manhunter."}

Scientists are still discussing how many species there are. The number of species varies between 100 and 250. Linnaeus named the genus inhonour of Fr. Georg Joseph Kamel, a Jesuit botanist. amel brought C. japonica from Manila to Spain.\nThey are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 2\u201320 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, usually glossy, and 3\u201317 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 1\u201312 cm diameter, with (in natural conditions) 5\u20139 petals; colour varies from white to pink and red, and yellow in a few species. The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 1\u20135 compartments, each containing 1\u20138 seeds.\nThe genus is generally adapted to acidic soils, and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought.\n\"Camellia\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of butterfly species.\nCultivation and uses.\n\"Camellia sinensis\" is very important commercially since tea is made from its leaves. Tea oil is a sweet seasoning and cooking oil made by pressing the seeds of \"Camellia sinensis\" or \"Camellia oleifera\".\nMany other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double flowers, as in the gallery below. \"Camellia japonica\" (often simply called Camellia) is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars; next are \"C. reticulata\", with over 400 named cultivars, and \"C. sasanqua\", with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include \"C. \u00d7 hiemalis\" (\"C. japonica\" \u00d7 \"C. sasanqua\") and \"C. \u00d7 williamsii\" (\"C. japonica\" \u00d7 \"C. salouenensis\"). They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flowers.\nCamellias have a slow growth rate. Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location. \n\"Camellia japonica\" is the state flower of Alabama as well as the city flower of the Chinese municipality Chongqing."}

It can be thought of as repeated multiplication, just as multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. \nIn general, given two numbers formula_1 and formula_2, the exponentiation of formula_1 and formula_2 can be written as formula_5, and read as \"formula_1 raised to the power of formula_2\", or \"formula_1 to the formula_2th power\". Other methods of mathematical notation have been used in the past. When the upper index cannot be written, people can write powers using the ^ or ** signs, so that 2^4 or 2**4 means formula_10.\nHere, the number formula_1 is called base, and the number formula_2 is called exponent. For example, in formula_10, 2 is the base and 4 is the exponent.\nTo calculate formula_10, one simply multiply 4 copies of 2. So formula_15, and the result is formula_16. The equation could be read out loud as \"2 raised to the power of 4 equals 16.\"\nMore examples of exponentiation are:\nIf the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square, because the area of a square is calculated using formula_20. So\nSimilarly, if the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube, because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_23. So\nIf the exponent is equal to -1, then the power is simply the reciprocal of the base. So\nIf the exponent is an integer less than 0, then the power is the reciprocal raised to the opposite exponent. For example:\nIf the exponent is equal to formula_28, then the result of exponentiation is the square root of the base, with formula_29 For example:\nSimilarly, if the exponent is formula_31, then the result is the nth root, where:\nIf the exponent is a rational number formula_33, then the result is the \"q\"th root of the base raised to the power of \"p\":\nIn some cases, the exponent may not even be rational. To raise a base \"a\" to an irrational \"x\"th power, we use an infinite sequence of rational numbers (\"xn\"), whose limit is x:\nlike this:\nThere are some rules which make the calculation of exponents easier:\nIt is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrices. In this case, the matrix must be square. For example, formula_44.\nCommutativity.\nBoth addition and multiplication are commutative. For example, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, and 2 \u00b7 3 is the same as 3 \u00b7 2. Although exponentiation is repeated multiplication, it is not commutative. For example, 2\u00b3=8, but 3\u00b2=9.\nInverse Operations.\nAddition has one inverse operation: subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: division.\nBut exponentiation has two inverse operations: The root and the logarithm. This is the case because the exponentiation is not commutative. You can see this in this example:"}

It comes after preschool. When children finish learning at primary school, they go to secondary school.\nIn Bangladesh, pre-primary classes start with the 5years children learning program where the children are taught with joy and happiness. Students from ages six to eleven, they finish learning from primary school and prepared for secondary.\nIn the United Kingdom, a primary school usually comprises a nursery and the first seven years of a child's full-time learning. In Australia and the United States, primary school begins with kindergarten. It lasts for six years, usually until the fifth or sixth grade. In the U.S., \"elementary school\" is a more common term for public primary schools. \"Primary school\" is often used in private or independent schools. (In private or independent schools the government does not give the schools money.)\nIn India, \"Primary Education\" means the 'Nursery', the 'Kindergarten' and four years of regular schooling thereafter. Admission to Nursery classes is for children above two years so that the age is 6+ when entering Class I. Children are taught language (mother tongue and English) reading/writing skills, basic arithmetic and quite a good amount of general information about the country, people, statesmen, great people, flora &amp; animals. However, this is true only for schools in the urban areas. Rural schools do not have Nursery or Kindergarten; they admit straight at Class I when the child is six. Further, the rural schools use the mother tongue as medium of instruction, not resorting to English in any way. Primary education is free in government schools. Moreover, rural primary schools offer free mid-day meals to children (the government pays for it) so that the drop out rate comes down. States of West Bengal, Maharashtra, Manipur, Nagaland and Kerala have done very good work in this way of spreading primary education.\nIn Singapore, primary school refers to those students who are normally between the ages of 7 to 12. Primary School is classified as P1 to P6 for Primary 1 to Primary 6 respectively. At the end of P6, students sit for a national level Primary School Leaving Exam (PSLE) which is used for placement into Secondary School. Prior to Primary School, pupils attend Kindergarten School for 2 years.\nIn Germany, the primary school is called \"Grundschule\" and is normally from first grade to fourth grade so it is usually for children who are between six and ten years old. In some eastern states, for example in Berlin, the Primary School is for children up to age 12. In most German states the children start learning English in third grade on a very low level, they learn how to count and the names of the colors and other easy things. But because of that low level a German child who has finished Primary School is normally not able to form correct English sentences. In Primary School the children are prepared for the secondary education. Primary School students attend three main subjects: Math, German and General Knowledge (\"Sachkunde\"). In General Knowledge the children learn about nature, about their own body, how to ride a bicycle safely and something about the city they live in and of course about Germany. Beside those main subjects the children attend subjects like arts, music and Physical Education."}

It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal. \nSome restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are restaurants which have the same name and serve the same food. McDonald's, Burger King, and Pizza Hut are examples of chain restaurants that are all over the world. These restaurants serve fast food, that is, inexpensive food, prepared and served quickly. At some, you do not have to even get out of the car to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called drive-throughs.\nThere are also chain restaurants that serve slightly more expensive food. They are called fast casual restaurants. Applebee's and Perkins are examples of this type of chain restaurant.\nHaute cuisine or 'fine dining' is found in a guide, such as the \"Michelin Guide\", the most famous restaurant guide in the world. Their 3-star rosettes are given only to restaurants with the highest standards of cooking and service. Interestingly, the Guide gives more 3-stars to Tokyo and Kyoto than to Paris, London and New York together. Traditionally, the restaurants of top hotels such as the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo or the H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris were the main places recognized for fine dining. Today, most Michelin Guide restaurants are separate establishments.\nAncient history.\nIn Ancient Greece and Rome there were small restaurant-bars offering food and drinks. They were called \"thermopolia\" (singular \"thermopolium\"). Many dwellings did not have kitchens, and eating out was an important part of socializing.\nIn Pompeii, 158 \"thermopolia\" with service counters have been found.

It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, ice cream, and Easter eggs. It can be in a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. Commercial chocolate has sugar and sometimes milk added. It has a melting point of about .\nDark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste. It was originally used to make drinking chocolate. Chocolate has been around the world since the time of the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztecs.\nHistory.\nThe cacao tree was first found to be useful for its seeds about two thousand years ago. Early Central Americans and Mexicans used the seeds from the cacao tree to make a drink that tasted bitter, not sweet. Only the important people could drink it. The word for \"chocolate\" in almost every language comes from its name in the Nahuatl language of Mexico, \"chocolatl\".\nLater on, this drink was made sweeter and made into what is known today as hot chocolate. It was made popular by Spanish explorers who brought it from North America to Spain. When chocolate was sweetened and made into candy, it became a very popular treat for many Europeans. At first, only the rich could afford chocolate. In France at that time, only nobles could buy it Now, many people enjoy it. Most cocoa today is made in Africa in countries like the Ivory Coast (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Nigeria.\nUntil the 16th century, the cacao tree was unknown to the Europeans. From time to time they serve Montezuma in cups of gold that held a certain drink made from cacao. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe.\nTypes.\nThere are three main types of chocolate: white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. White chocolate tastes much sweeter than the other two types, because it has more of the sweeter ingredients in it. \nMilk chocolate is sweet, but not as sweet as white chocolate. Milk chocolate has some cocoa. \nDark chocolate is the least sweet and has the strongest chocolate flavor. \nSafety.\nChocolate is safe to eat unless it is eaten in large amounts. Some animals, like dogs and cats, become sick even if they eat only a little chocolate. People with diabetes can also get sick from eating chocolate. Dark chocolate contains ingredients that lower blood pressure and fight diseases. Small amounts of dark chocolate have been found to lower the risk of heart disease because of polyphenol in chocolate. It is necessary to moderate the amount of chocolate you eat.\nProcess.\nMaking chocolate is a process that has many steps. First, the cocoa beans are collected and put in piles or containers to make them ferment. Fermentation makes the sugar in the beans turn into alcohol. Then the beans are dried and cleaned. Chocolate makers must cook the beans, and then crush them to make the cocoa butter and the chocolate liquor come out of them. Then the chocolate maker mixes different ingredients together to make the different kinds of chocolate. Dark or bittersweet chocolate is made from sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate liquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those ingredients plus milk and vanilla. White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor, but only cocoa butter, along with sugar, milk and vanilla. After these ingredients are put together, the chocolate maker is still not finished. One of the last things to be done is something called conching. Conching means crushing the chocolate very finely and keeping it warm so that it is liquid. Before chocolate is conched, it feels very rough in the mouth instead of smooth. Conches use heavy rollers that plow back and forth through the chocolate paste under regulated speeds and temperatures. Conching for several hours to several days makes good chocolate. The last step in making chocolate is called tempering. The chocolate is heated, and then shaken, and then cooled a few times.\nIngredients.\nThere are a number of ingredients in chocolate. The most notable of these are caffeine and theobromine. These two chemicals are closely related and are found in all cocoa beans. In any bean, the amount of each chemical varies depending on the genetics of the tree and the stresses placed on the tree during the growing season. It takes two hours to make chocolate."}

Historically Northumberland occupies a small part of the former Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria.\nHistory.\nNorthumberland is where Roman occupiers once guarded a frontier at Hadrian's Wall, Anglian invaders fought with Celtic natives, and Norman lords built castles to suppress rebellion and defend a contested border with Scotland. \nThe present-day county is a remnant of an independent Northern English kingdom that once stretched from Edinburgh to the River Humber. Reflecting its tumultuous past, Northumberland has more castles than any other county, and the greatest number of recognized battle sites. Once an economically important region that supplied much of the coal that powered the industrial revolution, Northumberland is now a rural county with a small and gradually shrinking population.\nAs the kingdom of Northumbria under Edwin (585\u2013632), the region's boundaries stretched from the Humber in the south to the Firth of Forth in the north. The kingdom and county were named for the Humber.\nThe county is noted for its undeveloped landscape of high moorland, a favourite with landscape painters, and now largely protected as a National park. Northumberland is the most sparsely populated county in England, with only 62 people per square kilometre.

No other instrument has played such an important part in Europe. The modern violin is about 400 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1000 years. By the time the modern orchestras started to form in the 17th century, the violin was nearly fully developed. It became the most important orchestral instrument - in fact, nearly half of the instruments in the orchestra is made up of violins, which are divided into two parts: \"first violins\" and \"second violins\".

The violin was not made directly from the instruments called viols. The word \"violin\" comes from the Middle Latin word \"vitula\". It means \"stringed instrument\". This word is also believed to be the source of the Germanic \u201cfiddle\u201d. The modern European violin changed over time from many different bowed stringed instruments. They were brought from the Middle East and the Byzantine Empire. Most likely, the first makers of violins took ideas from three kinds of current instruments. They are the rebec, in use since the 10th century, the Renaissance fiddle, and the \"lira da braccio.\" These instruments were held under the chin and bowed.\nIn the 17th century, there were several families of luthiers who were very good at making instruments. The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius, Amati, and Guarneri. Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still here today. They are kept in museums all around the world. They are some of the best instruments in existence. They can have prices over one million dollars.\nConstruction.\nThe biggest part of the violin is the wooden body. This acts as a resonating box. It makes the vibrating strings sound louder. Many of the parts of the violin are named after parts of the body. The front is called the \u201cbelly\u201d. The back is called the \u201cback\u201d. The sides are the \u201cribs\u201d. The strings go from near the top of the \u201cneck\u201d down the \u201cfingerboard\u201d and on to the \u201ctail piece\u201d. The strings go across the bridge halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the tailpiece. The bridge is not fixed onto the violin. It is held in place by the strings. The strings keep it in place because they are so tight. If the strings are completely loosened, the bridge will not stay on. The bridge helps to send the vibrations of the strings down to the body of the instrument. Inside the body there is a \u201csoundpost\u201d. This is a small piece of wood. It looks like a small finger. It goes from the belly to the back. The soundpost is also held in place by the strings. In the middle of the belly there are two long, curved holes. They are called \u201cf holes\u201d. This is because of their shape. The top of the strings are wound around pegs. The violin can be tuned by turning the pegs. The very top of the neck is called the scroll. Violins today also have a chinrest. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A shoulder rest can also be used. These are now made of foam. They have special legs to hold them on to the violin. Many beginners prefer to use a sponge and an elastic band instead.\nTo make it easier to tune the violin, many people find it helpful to have \u201cadjusters\u201d for \u201cfine tuning\u201d when the string is only slightly out of tune. These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece. They stop the strings from slipping when being tuned.\nStrings used to be made of gut. They are now mostly made of steel or nylon. Adjusters can only be used with some strings. The front of the violin body is made of spruce. The back and sides of the body are made of maple. The bow can be made of several kinds of wood. An example would be pernambuco. Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre. The bow is strung with horsehair (horsehair is hair that comes from the back of the horse's head also known as the mane or from the horse's tail).\nPlaying.\nIt takes years of practice to become a good violinist. A beginner will start with pieces and or exercises that do not require precise or complicated technique in right or left hand. Some examples of pieces that do not require great technique are \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" by Mozart, \"Children's Song\" (A German folk tune), and \"Over the Rainbow\". During these \"simple\" songs, the violinist will develop fundamental skills necessary for all other techniques, such as proper bow and violin holding. As the musician develops more and more confidence and skill in both left and right hand, pieces and exercises will become progressively more difficult. When necessary, they will also learn techniques and skills that will enhance their playing. Vibrato, smooth bow changes in the right hand, and shifting.\nThe violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is \u201cin tune\u201d. This is called intonation. The musician will also learn vibrato. This changes the intonation of each note slightly by making it a little bit sharper (higher), then a little bit flatter (lower), producing a kind of wobble. This is important in many styles of music to create mood.\nBesides plucking (pizzicato), there are many special effects. Some of them are glissando, portamento, and harmonics. There is also double stopping, chords, and scordatura tuning.\nThe violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands. When playing in chamber music or in orchestras the violinist sits, but this was not always the case. When sitting, the violinist may have to turn his or her right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow.\nMusic.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, composers wrote a lot of music for solo violin. Many of these composers were from Italy. They were themselves violinists. Some of these violinists are Corelli, Vitali, Vivaldi, Veracini, Geminiani, Locatelli and Tartini.\nIn Germany, Schmelzer and Biber wrote some very virtuoso violin music. Later, in the early 18th century, Bach and Handel wrote many masterpieces for the violin.\nIn the Classical music period, the great composers Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote solo works for the violin. They also wrote a large amount of chamber music, especially string quartets.\nIn the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written. These include concertos by Mendelssohn, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Brahms, Bruch, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. In the 20th century, many virtuoso works were written. These include Elgar, Sibelius, Szymanowski, Bart\u00f3k, Stravinsky, Berg, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Hindemith, and Penderecki. In the 19th century, Niccol\u00f2 Paganini was the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anything that had been written before. People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly and because he looked thin and moved his body about in strange ways.\nIn recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing. St\u00e9phane Grappelli was especially famous for this.\nFamous violinists.\nSome of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, David Oistrakh, Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel, and Isaac Stern. Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman, Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Repin, Nigel Kennedy, Hilary Hahn, Joshua Bell and fiddler Sara Watkins.\nOther websites.\nBest Violin for Beginners"}

They are used by trains to transport people and things from one place to another. (In America, people say railroad as well as railway). Often, there is more than one set of tracks on the railway line. For example, trains go east on one track and west on the other one.\nThe rails are supported by cross pieces set at regular intervals (called sleepers or ties), which spread the high pressure load imposed by the train wheels into the ground. They also maintain the rails at a fixed distance apart (called the gauge). Ties are usually made from either wood or concrete. These often rest on ballast, which is a name for very small pieces of broken up rock that are packed together and keep the railway tracks in place. Tracks are often made better by ballast tampers.\nThe upper surfaces of the rails are inclined slightly towards each other, typically on a slope of 1/20, and the rims of the train wheels are angled in the same way (\"coning\"). This helps guide the vehicles of the train along the track. Each wheel also has a flange, which sticks out from one edge all the way around. This makes sure the train does not \"derail\" (come off the track) and helps guide the train on sharp curves."}

It is sometimes called timber wolf or grey wolf.\nIt is the ancestor of the domestic dog. A recent study found that the domestic dog is descended from wolves tamed less than 16,300 years ago south of the Yangtze River in China.\nThere are many different wolf subspecies, such as the Arctic wolf. Some subspecies are listed on the endangered species list, but overall, \"Canis lupus\" is IUCN graded as 'least concern'.\nAppearance.\nAdult wolves are usually in length from nose to tail depending on the subspecies. Wolves living in the far north tend to be larger than those living further south. As adults they may weigh typically between . The heaviest wolf recorded weighed .\nThe wolf has a long muzzle, short ears, long legs, and a long bushy tail.\nWolves usually measure at the shoulder. Wolves have fur made up of two layers. The top layer is resistant to dirt, and the under-layer is water resistant. The color of their fur can be any combination of grey, white, taupe, brown, and black.\nLife.\nWolves live in groups called \"packs\". They are pack hunters. The members of the pack are usually family members, often just the parents and offspring. Wolves that are not family may join if they do not have a pack of their own. Packs are usually up to 12 wolves, but they can be as small as two or as large as 25. The leaders are called the parent (breeding) male and the parent (breeding) female. Their territory is marked by scent and howling; they will fight any intruders. Young wolves are called 'pups' or 'whelps'. Adult females usually give birth to five or six pups in a litter.\nWolves make a noise called a howl. They howl to communicate with each other from long distances and to mark the edges of their territory. Wolves have a complicated body language.\nWolves can run very fast and far. A wolf can run in a day.\nGrey wolves can live six to eight years in the wild. They can live in captivity for up to 17 years.\nDiet.\nWolves are carnivores and eat mostly medium to large size hoofed animals (unguligrades), but they will also eat rodents, insectivores and foxes. Some wolves have been seen eating salmon, seals, beached whales, lizards, snakes and birds. They also eat moose, bison, deer and other large animals.\nWolves usually stalk old or sick animals, but they do not always catch what they stalk. They may go days without food. Sometimes only one out of twelve hunts are successful. But the way they eat stays the same. The alpha male and female feed first. Then the other members feed. Sometimes (especially if the prey they have killed is large) wolves may store food and come back that day to feed on it. Wolves have very sharp teeth which helps them tear large chunks of meat from a dead animal. They will eat up to 2/7 their body weight. Wolves will also swallow food and then bring it back up for pups to eat.\nHabitat.\nWolves are found in Europe, Asia and North America. They can live in forests, deserts, mountains, tundra, grasslands and sometimes around towns and cities.\nArctic wolf.\nThe Arctic wolf may be a subspecies of the grey wolf. They live in the Canadian part of the Arctic Circle, as well as Greenland and Iceland.\nThe habitat of Arctic wolves is very hostile. Not much is known about their lifestyle. They are more friendly than other wolves, but they can still be very aggressive.\nTheir winter fur is highly resistant to the cold. Wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it. Since about 1930, the skull of many Arctic wolves has become smaller. This might be because of hybridization between wolves and dogs. They are tall when they're adults. Adult arctic wolves weigh about . Arctic wolves live in a group of 7-20 wolves. They may live up to 5\u201310 years in the wild. They can live for 14 years if they are well cared for in a zoo.\nWolves and humans.\nEven though many people think that wolves are terrible, mean creatures, they are actually much gentler than many people imagine. The main reason wolves become violent is because they may be sick or to protect other wolves in the pack. Many people around the world, especially in Canada and Alaska, have huskies for pets: they are a close relative of the wolf.\nA few years ago wolves were put back into Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to breed, because they were becoming endangered. The wolves have been very successful in the park. There had been no wolves there for a long time, because of hunting and poisoned water. Many people were not happy about this because they were afraid that the wolves would eat the sheep and cows near the park. However, wolves only eat livestock when they can not find wild prey.\nExtinction in Britain.\nWolves in Britain were all killed after centuries of hunting. The last wolves survived in the Scottish Highlands. There is a legend that the last one was killed there in 1743 by a character called MacQueen.\nWithin the past ten years, there have been studies that are in favour of allowing new wolves to come and live in the English countryside and Scottish Highlands again. One study was in 2007. Researchers from Norway, Britain, and Imperial College London decided that wolves would help add back plants and birds that now are eaten by deer. The wolves would keep the deer population lower. People were generally positive, but farmers living in rural areas wanted to be paid for livestock that were killed by the wolves."}

In Monrovia, there is a lot of pollution. \nHistory.\nWhite Americans made the American Colonization Society and bought the land in 1822. They didn't want black people who were not slaves to be in the United States. So they took some of them to Liberia. At the start of the American Civil War (in the 1860s) about 12.000 freed slaves lived there. In the 1990s and in the early 2000s, two civil wars badly affected the country."}

Most of the territory is made of desert flatlands. The largest city is La\u00e2youne. More than half the population live there. The territory has a population estimated at just more than 500,000.\nWestern Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since the 1960s when it was a Spanish colony. The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front independence movement, with its Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) government, both want control of the territory.\nSince 1975, most of the territory has been controlled by Morocco. In 1973, the local people, the Sahrawis, said the Moroccans and Mauritanians were occupying their land and started a movement. The movement turned violent, and the United Nations brokered a ceasefire in 1991. Many Sahrawis became refugees in Algeria. The rest of Western Sahara is controlled by the Polisario/SADR, backed by Algeria. Many important countries have pressed both parties to agree to a peaceful solution. Both Morocco and Polisario have tried to get recognition from other countries. Polisario has won formal recognition for SADR from 81 states, and was extended membership in the African Union, while Morocco has won recognition for its position from the Arab League. In both instances, recognitions have over the past two decades been extended and withdrawn according to changing international trends.\nSome countries say that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic should be the government in Western Sahara. Morocco says that they own it. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was made by the \"Polisario Front\" a group of people who wanted Spain to leave, but now want Morocco to leave also.\nThe United Nations calls all of the Western Sahara a dependency of Spain."}

Its capital is Maputo. There are about 31 million people. In 1975, Mozambique became independent from Portugal. (National Day on 25th June, 1975) The country was named Mo\u00e7ambique by the Portuguese after the Island of Mozambique which was the capital of Portuguese Africa. After independence from Portugal it became the People's Republic of Mozambique. There was a big civil war from 1977 to 1992.\nMozambique has many natural resources. Portugal, Spain, and Belgium are among the country's most important partners. It is the second poorest country in the world. They have the world's lowest life expectancy. In 2012, large natural gas reserves were found in Mozambique. The revenues from the reserves might dramatically change the economy.\nThe only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese. About half the people speak it as a second language and very few as a first language. Languages widely spoken natively include Swahili, Makhuwa, and Sena. The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity. There are also Muslim and African traditional religious minorities.\nMozambique is a member of the African Union, Commonwealth of Nations, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, the Latin Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Southern African Development Community.\nGeography and climate.\nAt , Mozambique is the world's 35th-largest country. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest.\nThe country is divided into two regions by the Zambezi River. To the north of the Zambezi River, the narrow coastline moves inland to hills and low plateaus. Further west are rugged highlands, which include the Niassa highlands, Namuli or Shire highlands, Angonia highlands, Tete highlands and the Makonde plateau, covered with miombo woodlands. To the south of the Zambezi River, the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and Lebombo mountains in the deep south.\nThe country has five main rivers and several smaller ones. The largest and most important is the Zambezi. The country has four notable lakes: Lake Niassa (or Malawi), Lake Chiuta, Lake Cahora Bassa and Lake Shirwa, all in the north.\nClimate.\nMozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons. The wet season is from October to March and the dry season from April to September. Conditions vary depending on altitude. Rainfall is heavy along the coast and is less in the north and south. Yearly precipitation changes from depending on the region. Cyclones are common during the wet season. Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from in July to in February.\nCities.\nThis is a list of cities and towns with the most people. It is based on the most recent census done for each city or town.\nThe entire country has about 22 million people. These 14 cities have 5 million total. This shows that most people still live in rural areas.\nDivisions.\nMozambique is divided into ten provinces (\"provincias\") and one capital city (\"cidade capital\") with provincial status. The provinces are divided into 129 districts (\"distritos\"). The districts are further divided in 405 \"Postos Administrativos\" (Administrative Posts) and then into Localidades (Localities), the lowest geographical level of the central state administration. Since 1998, 43 \"Munic\u00edpios\" (Municipalities) have been created in Mozambique.\nCulture.\nArts.\nThe music of Mozambique can be for many purposes. These can be religious or for traditional ceremonies. Musical instruments are usually handmade. Some of the instruments used include drums made of wood and animal skin; the \"lupembe\", a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood; and the marimba, which is a kind of xylophone native to Mozambique. The marimba is a popular instrument with the Chopi of the south central coast. They are famous for their musical skill and dance.\nThe Makonde are renowned for their wood carving and elaborate masks that are commonly used in traditional dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings. Shetani, (evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy ebony, tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces. The Ujamaa are totem-type carvings which show lifelike faces of people and various figures. Theses sculptures are usually called \u201cfamily trees\u201d because they tell stories of many generations.\nDuring the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art showed the oppression by the colonial power, and became a symbol of the resistance. After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter Malangatana Ngwenya and the sculptor Alberto Chissano. Art during the 1980s and 1990s shows the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation and struggle.\nDances are usually highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of Makua dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country have a traditional dance called \"tufo\", to celebrate Islamic holidays.\nFood.\nBecause the Portuguese were there for nearly 500 years, they greatly impacted the cuisine of Mozambique. Crops such as cassava (a starchy root) and cashew nuts (Mozambique was once the largest producer of these nuts), and \"p\u00e3ozinho\" were brought in by the Portuguese. The use of spices and seasonings such as onions, bay leaves, garlic, fresh coriander, paprika, chili peppers, red sweet peppers, and wine were introduced by the Portuguese. So was sugarcane, maize, millet, rice, sorghum (a type of grass), and potatoes. \"Prego\" (steak roll), \"rissois\" (battered shrimp), \"espetada\" (kebab), \"pudim\" (pudding), and the popular \"inteiro com piripiri\" (whole chicken in piri-piri sauce) are all Portuguese dishes commonly eaten in present-day Mozambique.\nEntertainment.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Mozambique."}

Fossey was buried at the site she created as a graveyard for the gorillas. Fossey studied the lives of mountain gorillas for 18 years. She was the world\u2019s expert on mountain gorillas. Her dedication allowed for mountain gorillas to continue as a species. \u00a0Some of the people who lived in the area did not like her because of her thoughts on how the gorillas should be treated.

They formed in Crawley, West Sussex, England in 1976.\nHistory.\nThe Cure began in 1974 as 'Easy Cure'. It was formed by Robert Smith (vocals, guitar) together with schoolmates Michael Dempsey (bass), Lol Tolhurst (drums), and local guitarist Porl Thompson. \nThey began writing and demoing their own songs almost immediately, playing throughout 1975 in Southern England to an ever growing army of fans. In September 1976 the 'Easy' was dropped, along with Porl, and an eager trio now known simply as The Cure were quickly signed to Chris Parry's new Fiction label.\nFirst album.\nIn September 1977 their debut album \"Three Imaginary Boys\" was released to great acclaim, and as the band toured extensively around the UK, the singles \u201cBoys Don't Cry\u201d and \u201cJumping Someone Else's Train\u201d were released. Michael left the band at the mid of the year, and Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) joined. In early 1978 the 4-piece Cure embarked on an exploration of the darker side of Robert's songwriting, and emerged with the minimalist classic Seventeen Seconds, along with their first real 'hit single' \u201cA Forest.\u201d They supporting Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias in October 1978.\nResults and second album.\nAfter an intense world tour Matthieu left the group, and in early 1979 the trio recorded an album of mournful atmospheric soundscapes entitled \"Faith\", which included another successful single in \u201cPrimary.\u201d\nThird album.\nThe band then set out on a second trip around the world, named \u201cThe Picture Tour,\u201d and they put out the single \u201cCharlotte Sometimes.\u201d In 1982 The Cure went back into the studio to record the album \u201cPornography\u201d which had a dark mood. The trip was difficult for the band members, and the single \u201cThe Hanging Garden\u201d came out just as Simon left the band.\nFirst dance single.\nRobert Smith and Lol Tolhurst were now the only band members. To feel better, the band chose to change the dark mood of the band into a more fun \u201cpop\u201d mood. So they recorded a dance single called \u201cLet's Go To Bed,\u201d and became good friends with the song's film-clip director, Tim Pope. The band continued into 1983 with two more fun singles: \u201cThe Walk\u201d and \u201cThe Lovecats.\u201d\nFourth album.\nIn 1984 \"The Top\" was released, a strange hallucinogenic mix, which contained the infectiously psychedelic single \u201cThe Caterpillar.\u201d\nExpansion of the band.\nThe world \u2018Top Tour\u2019 saw the band expand to a 5-piece, with the addition of Andy Anderson (drums) and Phil Thornalley (bass), and the return of Porl Thompson (guitar).\nThe new Cure sound was captured live for the album \"Concert\". Andy and Phil left soon after the end of the tour, and were replaced by Boris Williams (drums) and further returnee Simon Gallup (bass). This new incarnation started work on 1985's The Head On The Door with a very real sense of 'something happening'... The vibrant hit single \u201cInbetween Days\u201d was followed up by \u201cClose To Me,\u201d and the ensuing world tour paved the way for the massive success of the singles collection \"Standing On A Beach\" in 1986. That summer saw the band headline the Glastonbury Festival for the first time, and a year of extensive gigs and festivals was crowned by Tim Pope's live concert film The Cure In Orange.\nFirst double album.\nIn 1987 The Cure brought out \"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\", an immense double album of extreme and extraordinary stylistic range, and with the arrival of Roger O'Donnell on keyboards the 6-piece Cure traveled the world with the 'Kissing Tour', enjoying four more hit singles along the way. The wonderfully atmospheric \"Disintegration\" was demoed in 1988 and released in 1989, and despite being a work of powerful brooding grandeur, it too gave rise to four hit singles. The 'Prayer Tour' followed, with the band back down to a five-piece following the departure of Lol Tolhurst. It was captured live for the album \"Entreat\".\nReplacing Roger O'Donnell.\nIn early 1990 Roger O'Donnell left the group, and was replaced by long-time band friend Perry Bamonte, just in time for a series of headlining European festival shows that included the band's second Glastonbury headline slot. The album \"Mixed Up\" was released, supported by the re-mixed singles \u201cNever Enough,\u201d \u201cClose To Me\u201d and \u201cA Forest,\u201d and in 1991 The Cure at last won some long overdue \u201chome\u201d recognition with a Brit Award for \u201cBest British Group.\u201d\nSixth album.\nIn 1992 they recorded \"Wish\", a richly diverse multi-faceted guitar driven album hailed by some as their best work to date. It spawned 3 fabulous hit singles, and the glorious \u2018Wish Tour' that followed was a worldwide sell out. The sheer power of the shows inspired the release of two live works in 1993, Paris and Show. Immediately after the tour ended, guitarist Porl Thompson left the band again (this time with a smile!), and The Cure headlined the XFM 'Great Xpectations Show' in London's Finsbury Park as a 4-piece. The band also contributed \u201dBurn\u201d to the film \u201cThe Crow\u201d and covered \u201cPurple Haze\u201d for the Hendrix tribute album 'Stone Free'.\nSeventh album.\nIn 1994 Boris Williams decided to move on, and in early 1995 Jason Cooper took up residency behind the drum kit, with Roger O'Donnell rejoining once more on keyboards.

{"id": "12358", "revid": "1126050", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12358", "title": "Ferret", "text": "Ferrets (\"Mustela putorius furo\") are domestic animals. They are the domestic form of the European polecat. They are in the weasel genus of the family Mustelidae. \nFerrets have an average length of 20\u00a0inches (51\u00a0cm) including a 5\u00a0inch (13\u00a0cm) tail, weigh about . They live for about 7-10 years. Males are larger than females. They are sociable animals, and are usually kept in groups of two or more.\nWith their long thin body, ferrets look like a large weasel. They may have different colours and markings on their fur. A lot of ferrets in one place will sometimes have a strange smell. This is caused by natural oils produced by the ferrets.\nBehavior.\nAs naturally crepuscular animals, ferrets tend to sleep during the day. This deters many people from getting them although most ferret owners say their ferrets change their sleeping schedules to that of their owners.\nFerrets and Humans.\nDomesticated ferrets are used for hunting, or can be kept as pets. Hunting with ferrets is called ferreting. Because of their thin body, they can go down into holes and hunt rodents and rabbits. Ferrets have been kept as pets since the Middle Ages.\nHealth.\nFerrets suffer from several health problems. Some of the most common health problems are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system. Viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza. Health problems can happen in unspayed females when not being used for breeding. Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems\nFerrets as Pets.\nFerrets are legal to have as a pet in most places. They are not legal in a few places in the United States. Ferrets should be vaccinated. A breeder or pet store will get it spayed or neutered and also de-scented. Ferrets can spray the natural oils from their anal glands similar to that of a skunk if not de-scented. \nFerrets are very flexible and can fit into small holes to flush out rabbits or rodents. Ferrets can get through open vents or small holes in walls. Ferrets are good climbers so if curtains are touching the floor they can easily climb the curtains. \nFerrets should be kept in a group, unless you can provide them with multiple hours of activity, they get quite bored when alone. Ferrets tend to sleep curled up together in a ball usually making them indistinguishable from one another.\nFerrets also get along with cats but depends on the temperaments of all involved. The likelihood of ferrets and cats getting along is increased if the cat is raised with a pet ferret, but there are still risks associated with introducing them to one another.\nDiet.\nFerrets are carnivores and cannot tolerate grains or vegetable matter well. Their diet should consist of around 20% fat and 80% meat. Ferrets need a high calorie diet: commercial dog and cat foods do not contain enough fats and protein to suit them. Feeding them such a diet while convenient will ultimately shorten the ferrets life.\nFerrets are subject to insulinoma and as such they should not be given fruits except on rare occasions as a treat. Raisins are a favorite of most ferret but should be given extremely sparingly. Fresh chicken, turkey or even duck is a good choice for your ferret. Commercial ferret foods are available but many contain grains and also fruits and as such are not suitable for them. Research brand ingredients or find a recipe to make your own."}

Nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well and to keep them fit and healthy. Nurses also help with end-of-life needs and assist other family members with grieving.\nNursing is a profession, like a doctor, but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need. In some places, nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse.\nNurses work in many places. Nurses work in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and in the community, and they even visit people at home if they can not get out.\nSometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors, because the nurses will be able to help patients directly, by talking to them, doing things they need, carefully watching that nothing goes wrong, and then seeing them as they get better.\nLike doctors, nurses can choose what work they do. Some nurses train and work to help during surgery. Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition (what to eat), and disease (what can make people sick). Nurses can do many different jobs to help people.\nNurses are in demand because there are not enough nurses to handle hospital needs. Because of this shortage nurses will sometimes travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing.\nTitles.\nRegistered Nurse in some countries like U.S is a term for an officially registered nurse. In hospitals where nurses wear uniforms with caps, an R.N. is recognizable by the fact that the cap has two black stripes.\nNursing in Australia.\nNursing in Australia is done by \"Registered Nurses\" or \"Enrolled Nurses\". Both must complete education past high school. An Enrolled Nurse must complete a course of study between 12 and 18 months. Registered Nurses need to complete a Bachelor's degree.\nGender-neutral titles.\nTitles have changed because men as well as women can be nurses. It was, in most countries, a wholly female occupation. The titles were designed for females and have now been revised to be genderless. The exception to this is midwife, a term still used because it seems natural that a nurse helping a mother through childbirth should be a female. There are some males acting as midwives. The supervisory body for UK nursing is the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\nTeams.\nSome medical and surgical groups operate as teams. This means that senior surgeons always operate with the same group of people, so reducing the risk of mistakes, and allowing juniors to learn and understand the individual cases.\nAlso, moving around as a team allows specialist groups to serve more than one hospital. This is particularly useful when the amount of work in a speciality does not permit having a full team on site in each hospital. "}

It premiered on May 1, 1999 after the premiere of the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards as a sneak preview, and officially premiered on July 17 on the same year.\nIt is Nickelodeon's most popular show. It has been made into many pieces of merchandise. The main character, SpongeBob is an adult sea sponge that acts like a child. He lives in a pineapple under the sea. The show has gotten three spin-offs: \"\", \"The Patrick Star Show\", and one with Squidward Tentacles.\nCharacters.\nThe show gets its name from its main character, SpongeBob SquarePants, a male sponge. He looks more like a yellow kitchen sponge used for cleaning dishes than a sea sponge. His best friend is a starfish named Patrick Star. His grumpy neighbor is an octopus named Squidward Tentacles.\nSpongeBob and Squidward work as employees at a restaurant called the Krusty Krab in the underwater town of Bikini Bottom. The Krusty Krab, which is run by a greedy red crab named Mr. Krabs, is famous for its blue Krabby Patty burgers. The recipe for blue Krabby Patties is top secret. The owners of a competing restaurant called the Chum Bucket, Plankton and Karen, often try to steal the recipe.\nEpisodes list.\nEpisodes.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nReception.\nRatings and run-length achievements.\nWithin its first month on air, \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" overtook \"Pok\u00e9mon\" as the highest rated Saturday-morning children's series on television. It held an average national Nielsen rating of 4.9 among children aged two through eleven, denoting 1.9 million viewers. Two years later, the series had firmly established itself as Nickelodeon's second highest-rated children's program, after \"Rugrats\". \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" was credited with helping Nickelodeon take the \"Saturday-morning ratings crown\" for the fourth straight season in 2001. The series had gained a significant adult audience by that point\u2014nearly 40 percent of its 2.2 million viewers were aged 18 to 34. In response to its weekend success, Nickelodeon gave \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" time slots at 6:00\u00a0PM and 8:00\u00a0PM, Monday through Thursday, to increase the series' exposure. By the end of 2001, \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" boasted the highest ratings for any children's series, on all of television. Weekly viewership of the series had reached around fifteen million, at least five million of whom were adults.\nControversies.\nIn 2009, several groups, including the American Family Foundation, attacked SpongeBob for being homosexual. The character had recently appeared on a music video with other kids' show characters to promote diversity and tolerance. However, the creator said in 2002 that SpongeBob is asexual, meaning that he does not seek sexual partners at all.\nDecreasing quality.\nMany fans and critics believe that after season 3 and the first movie, the series started to decline in quality. This was because many writers from the first three seasons seasons left (although Doug Lawrence, Aaron Springer, Erik Wiese and C.H. Greenblatt still stayed). Some of the later episodes were poorly received because the characters did not act the way they acted in the first three seasons. However, apparently, the show's quality improved once more after the second movie, when Stephen Hillenburg returned, until his death in 2018."}

This process helps to maintain the trustworthiness of scientific discoveries."}

This means that it is part of the United States and citizens of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States as well. Puerto Rico is not an independent country, but there has been a movement for independence for almost two centuries. There have been protests, votes, and armed attacks for independence.\nPuerto Rico has almost 4 million (4,000,000) people. Its political system is based on a republican system. It has two official languages: Spanish and English. The currency used is the United States dollar. \"Puerto Rico\" means \"rich port\" in Spanish.\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico includes the largest, main island and a number of smaller islands, including Mona, Vieques, and Culebra. Of those three smaller islands, only Culebra and Vieques are populated all year. Mona is unpopulated, but employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources sometimes visit the island to inspect it and its wildlife. People can visit the island for hiking and camping by getting the permission needed. San Juan, on the northern side of the main island, is the island's largest city and the capital of the territory. The common languages are Spanish spoken by 94.7% of the population and English, spoken by 5.3%.\nOn May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy after a massive debt and weak economy. It is the largest bankruptcy case in American history.\nStatus with respect to the USA.\nPuerto Rico is one of the unincorporated territories of the USA. Because it is not a state, citizens cannot vote in U.S. national elections unless they have an address in one of the 50 US states. These are organized, self-governing territories with locally elected governors and legislatures. Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives.\nHistory.\nThe history of Puerto Rico began when the Ortoiroid people started living in the island between 3000 and 2000\u00a0BC. Other tribes, for example the Saladoid and Arawak Indians, lived in the island between 430\u00a0BC and 1000\u00a0AD. When Christopher Columbus arrived at the island in 1492 and named it \"San Juan Bautista\", the people living there were the \"Ta\u00ednos\".\nSince it is in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico formed an important part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest, and colonization of the New World. The Spanish spread race-based slavery across the island. In the 19th century, slave revolts and the abolitionist movement brought an end to legal slavery.\nThe island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European countries for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, Puerto Rico was invaded and became a possession of the United States.\nDuring the 20th century, Puerto Rico's political status changed from time to time. The Foraker Act of 1900 created a civil government to replace the military government made after the Spanish\u2013American war, and the Jones Act of 1917 gave Puerto Rican people United States citizenship. Afterwards, in 1952, the drafting of Puerto Rico's own Constitution and democratic elections were established.\nThe political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the United States, is still not completely defined. Many people want to resolve this status, while others want the status to remain the same. Of the people who want to change the status, some want Puerto Rico to become a new U.S. state, while others want Puerto Rico to become a fully independent country.\nGeography.\nPuerto Rico is an archipelago, with a main island where most of the population lives, two smaller islands (Vieques and Culebra) with residents, and many other smaller islands. The main island has a mountain range in the center, which covers most of the island. The highest point is 4,390\u00a0feet (1,338\u00a0meters)\nPolitical parties.\nPuerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism.\nThe issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last \"status voting\" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades.\nDemographics.\nPuerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world.\nThe population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is:\nCulture.\nLiterature.\nPuerto Rico has a strong literary tradition. The most important playwrights are Ren\u00e9 Marqu\u00e9s (author of \"The Oxcart\") and Lin Manuel Miranda (creator of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\"). The most famous poets are Julia de Burgos (\"Yo fui mi ruta\") and Giannina Braschi (author the poetry epic \"Empire of Dreams\"). Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists include Rosario Ferre (Eccentric Neighborhoods), Giannina Braschi (United States of Banana), and Esmeralda Santiago (When I Was Puerto Rican). Puerto Rican poets who live in New York are called Nuyorican poets.\nArt.\nJos\u00e9 Campeche (1751-1809) is the first known Puerto Rican painter. He painted in the best rococo style. Franciso Oller painted Puerto Rican landscapes and still life paintings the 19th Century. In the 20th century Franciso Rod\u00f3n who paints portraits of celebrities. In the 21st century, Allora and Calzadilla are conceptual artists in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nMusic.\nPuerto Rico music is often called Latin music. There are many popular styes of Puerto Rican dance music, including Salsa, Bomba, Plena, and R\"eggaeton\". One of the most popular bands today is Calle 13. World famous Puerto Rican singers include Jennifer Lopez, Hector Lavoe, Tito Puentes, and Marc Anthony. Ricky Martin won the 1999 Grammy Award for \"Best Latin Pop Performance\" for Living La Vida Loca.\nPhilosophy.\nPuerto Rican philosophy deals with Puerto Rican independence, education, racism, and liberty for all. The first major Puerto Rican philosopher was Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos. He was born in the 19th Century in Puerto Rico. He believed that Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba should unite to be free from Colonial powers. Francisco Jos\u00e9 Ramos was born in the 20th century. His philosophy deals with Ancient Greeks, American imperialism, and Buddhism. Giannina Braschi is a contemporary political philosopher. She writes about freedom, immigration, revolution, and justice. Braschi was inspired by a major Mexican woman philosopher Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz. Puerto Rican philosophers are sometimes called Latinx philosophers or Latin American philosophers."}

It used to be known as the Somali Republic. It is a country in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Kenya to the southwest, the Gulf of Aden with Yemen to the north, the Guardafui Channel and Somali Sea to the east, and Ethiopia to the west. A person from Somalia is called a \"Somali\".\nGovernment.\nSomalia is a republic governed by a federal administration with various regional administrations governing on a micro level.\nSomalia is an independent country. Since the Somali Civil War in the 1980s, there has been no working government that covers all of Somalia; instead, different clans have been fighting for control. Somalia is now trying to gain control of their people and get back up on its feet with very little resources.\nClan wars.\nThere are four big tribes in Somalia, the Hawiye, the Dirweyn, the Koofur Orsi inhabitants and the Darood. Somalis are a nation of related families, which are called clans. Groups of clans sometimes band together based on a common ancestor or other blood relationship. Sometimes these family relationships date back hundreds or even thousands of years in the past.\nSomalis are mostly camel or goat herders, and depend on their livestock to live. In Somalia there are limited sources of drinking water and grazing land, and disputes over grazing rights, water rights, or land in general can lead to fighting between families. Because of the clan system, the families involved will call on their clan for help, leading to a clan war.\nThe discovery of oil and minerals in Somalia, as well as the power and money associated with politics and business, has created more opportunities for families to get ahead, and has also created more reasons for families to have disputes.\nBecause Somalia does not have a working legal system, the only help a family in Somalia has to solve a dispute with another family is to get their clan involved. The only solution to the clan wars in Somalia is a working legal system, but the only group who has succeeded in creating one is the Islamic Courts Union. Unfortunately the Islamic Courts Union was accused of being terrorists and Ethiopia invaded Somalia to topple their government and put the government they created in power instead.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times, Somalia was a place where people from Egypt and Arabia went to buy Gum Arabic, Myrrh and Ebony Wood. The Ancient Egyptians used to call it Punt, which meant \"God's Land\". Somalis started herding camel and goats about 4,000 years ago, and they remain mostly herders today.\nVisitors from as far away as China visited Somalia, such as Zheng He.\nMedieval history.\n400 more years later, the king of Ethiopia told his subjects that God hated Ifat, and he invaded Ifat with his army, destroying everything he came across and driving the king of Ifat to an island off the coast of Zeila, where he died. The king of Ethiopia then took part of Ifat and added it to his kingdom, and made Ifat pay him lots of money once a year. The remains of Ifat put their kingdom back together again and renamed it Adal.\nAbout a hundred years later, the King of Adal was deposed by an influential warlord by the name of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, who had lots of influence with Somali clans across the north. He declared a Jihad against Ethiopia, brought together a huge army that included Turkish musketeers and Somali cavalry. The Somali cavalry were especially deadly because they could shoot arrows while riding their horses, something that the Mongol hordes and Japanese Samurai are also famous for.\nAhmad chose a bad time, however, because the Portuguese Empire was muscling into East Africa. They had taken over the whole east African coast up to Baraawe, and were trying to take over Mogadishu. The Portuguese decided to help out the Ethiopians because the Ethiopians were Christians and the Portuguese did not like Muslims. Ahmad had taken over more than half of Ethiopia when a troop of Portuguese musketeers showed up to help the Ethiopians out. One Portuguese musketeer managed to shoot Ahmad himself, killing him.\nA lot of the Somali cavalry was only there because of Ahmad, so the Jihad ended and Ethiopia wound up invading Adal. The Turks had to send an army to stop them from taking over Zeila, and Adal ended up becoming part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. On those days we do not find the exact people dwell in zeila, but the history ascribed the black people, without tracing their origin and their tribes.\nHowever, some historians attributed Zeila inhabitant were called semaale without farther lucid explanation.\nDaraawiish State.\nThe Turks and Portuguese fought over East Africa for the next 200 years, but the Turks eventually won about 270 years ago. Northern Somalia stayed under Turkish protection after Ahmad died, and the east coast including Mogadishu ended up under the protection of the King of Oman. When Egypt declared independence from the Turks a hundred years later, Northern Somalia became part of Egypt. Egypt came under British protection shortly after that, and northern Somalia basically became a British protectorate as well. This became official about 130 years ago, and northern Somalia officially became British Somaliland.\nThe Kingdom of Italy had just come together as one country around this time, and wanted the same things that the other big countries had, like colonies. Italy offered to buy the rights to the east Africa coast from Oman, who was in charge of protecting the cities and small kingdoms there, and Oman agreed. Italy made deals with some of the larger kingdoms/sultanates (like the Sultanate of Nugaal) for them to be under Italian protection, but the smaller ones Italy just invaded. This became Italian Somalia in 1905, with capital Mogadishu.\nEthiopia, which had fallen apart again after Ahmad's Jihad, had recently put itself back together again as well, and started invading small Somali kingdoms as well, and by 1890 there were not many left. The French got in on this too, but they just took over a small area which today is Djibouti.\nLots of Somalis did not like what was going on, so a Muslim religious leader named Mohammed Abdullah Hassan started a group called the Darwiish to fight the British, Italians and Ethiopians. The British called him the \"Mad Mullah\" and spent about 30 years fighting him, eventually using fighter planes against his cavalry. At their height the Darwiish controlled almost a third of Somalia.\nItaly created a colony around Mogadishu and enlarged the territory of Italian Somalia after WW1 with the areas south of the Juba river. In the next 20 years the Italian colony grew in importance, having at Hafun the biggest salt production in the world and in the Scebeli river a huge production of bananas exported to Europe. In 1928 was created the first airport in Somalia's capital and later in 1939 was started the longest air route in Africa with the Linea dell'impero, a flight between Rome and Mogadishu.\nWorld War 2 history.\nWhen Benito Mussolini took power in Italy, he ended the deals he made with the bigger Somali sultanates and invaded them conquering all the area that was to be the colony of Italian Somalia. Then he invaded and took over Ethiopia, using poison gas on the Ethiopians. Shortly afterwards, World War 2 broke out and he invaded British Somaliland, but two years later the British returned and liberated British Somaliland and Ethiopia as well as taking over Italian Somaliland.\nAfter the war, Britain wanted to put all of the places Somalis lived in one country, which would be a British protectorate. The Ethiopians complained that they should be able to keep the areas they conquered, and the Italians also complained the same thing, so in the end the Ethiopians got to keep their bit, and the Italians did too. However, Italian Somaliland was put under a United Nations mandate, so the Italians could not make it a colony.\nCold War history.\nIn 1960 both British and Italian Somaliland declared independence together as the \"Somali Republic\". It was chosen the Latin alphabet for the Somali language. Many areas where Somalis lived were still part of Britain, Ethiopia and France. Somalia wanted to get back all the areas that had been colonized by the French, Ethiopians and British. Somalia and Ethiopia had a short war in 1964 over the Ethiopian part of Somalia, and it was obvious that more fighting was to come.\nIn 1969, the President of Somalia was killed by a man whose clan had been hurt by his policies, and General Mohammed Siad Barre took over the country. Siad Barre built a huge army with help from the Soviet Union and when Ethiopia fell for the fourth time (this time because of a Communist takeover) he invaded. The Soviet Union decided that Ethiopia was more important than Somalia and double-crossed Siad Barre, supplying huge amounts of weapons to Ethiopia. Other countries like Cuba and Israel also sent help to Ethiopia, so in the end Siad Barre lost the war.\nEthiopia's new government then began helping Somali rebel groups, who did not like how Siad Barre took over the country, and these rebel groups toppled Siad Barre' government in 1991 and forced him out of the country. After this, however, all of the rebel groups started fighting amongst themselves over who would be in charge now that Siad Barre was gone.\nEventually, some of the rebel groups decided to make their own governments in the land that they controlled. One, called Somaliland, declared independence from Somalia entirely, while another called Puntland declared independence \"for now\" until a new Somali national government can be put together. Dozens of attempts to create a new national government failed.\nModern history.\nBecause there was no government in most of Somalia (except where one had been built from scratch, like Puntland and Somaliland) Somalia's only legal system, beyond the law of the gun, was traditional custom and Islamic Sharia law. Because of this, Sharia legal scholars in the lawless south of Somalia gained quite a bit of influence. Around the same time, the people fighting for Somali lands in Ethiopia to be part of Somalia turned to the example of the Afgani Mujahideen, and created their own group called al-Ittihad al-Islamiyya or the Islamic Union. During the 1990s Ethiopia invaded Somalia several times to attack the Islamic Union, who were helping Somali rebels in Ethiopia.\nAfter 2001, the United States of America became very suspicious of both the Sharia courts and the Islamic Union of being terrorists. Warlords made a group called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism. The Sharia courts banded together to protect themselves and created the Islamic Courts Union. People liked the Sharia courts and hated the gangsters, so everyone helped the Islamic Courts Union, who defeated the gangsters and drove them out of Mogadishu in 2006. The Islamic Courts Union then formed an army and took over most of southern Somalia.\nThe United States of America and Ethiopia was alarmed by this takeover, so Ethiopia invaded southern Somalia in 2007 and put a new government in power that was made up of the rebel groups that Ethiopia had funded 15 years earlier. Almost everyone disagreed with this decision, and that same year a rebellion against this new government broke out in Mogadishu and spread across the whole country by 2008. At around the same time, Somali pirates kidnapped westerners from big ships for ransom."}

It was the least expensive iPod.\nThe most expensive iPod is called the iPod touch. It has a touch screen, like the iPhone. The first iPod touch was released in 2007 and is still available today.\niPods often contain songs downloaded from an online music store, using a program called iTunes. (The name of Apple's music and video store is the iTunes Store.) Songs are sold in AAC file format, not MP3 or WMA. These are popular formats for compressing (making smaller) music until it does not take up much space and can easily be put on a media player such as the iPod.\nThe App Store is an online shop that is run by Apple Inc. where people can buy software for their iPhone or iPod Touch. It opened on July 11, 2008. Over 2 million applications (or apps for short) are available for people to buy. Some apps are available for free."}

It is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The official language of Costa Rica is Spanish. The official currency is the col\u00f3n. It has enjoyed a long period of peace since the 1863 civil war. Because of its natural beauty and political stability, it is nicknamed the \"Switzerland of Latin America\". Costa Rica has had army since December 1, 1863. Instead of spending money on the military, the government spends money on education and head 1 people live in Costa Rica. The capital city is San Jos\u00e9. The current President is Carlos Alvarado Quesada. He was elected in 2014.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian period.\nThe indigenous people of Costa Rica belong to the Intermediate Area. This Intermediate Area is where the Mesoamerican and Andean indigenous cultures mixed together. The country was influenced by various Chibcha speaking indigenous people.\nThe impact of indigenous peoples' culture on modern Costa Rica has been small. The country did not have a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the indigenous population was absorbed into the Spanish colony. There are still some small indigenous groups. The largest is the Bribri and Boruca tribes in south Costa Rica.\nSpanish colonization.\nChristopher Columbus sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his last trip in 1502. He reported large amounts of gold jewelry among the indigenous people.\nDuring the colonial period, Costa Rica was the most southern province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. But it mostly ruled itself as a part of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition to trade with the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and the lack of gold and silver made Costa Rica into a poor, little populated region of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica was called \"the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America\" by a Spanish governor in 1719.\nCosta Rica's poverty was also because there were not enough indigenous people available for slavery. Most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land. There were no large \"haciendas\" (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was unappreciated and forgotten by the Spanish Crown. It had to develop on its own.\nCosta Rica became a \"rural democracy\" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a better climate.\nIndependence.\nCosta Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On September 15, 1821, after the last Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence (1810\u201321), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica.\nCosta Rica joined the First Mexican Empire of Agust\u00edn de Iturbide. After its collapse in 1823, Costa Rica became a province of the new Federal Republic of Central America. it existed from 1823 to 1839. It had a very loose authority over its provinces, especially the poor and remote Costa Rica.\nIn 1824, the Costa Rican capital was moved to San Jos\u00e9. This led to a brief battle with the old capital, Cartago.\nWhile civil wars were common in the Federal Republic of Central America, Costa Rica was largely peaceful.\nIn 1838, Costa Rica formally proclaimed itself an independent country. The local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become politically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration.\nEconomic growth.\nCoffee was first planted in Costa Rica in the early 19th century. It was first shipped to Europe in 1843. It became Costa Rica's first major export. Coffee would remain Costa Rica's biggest export until the 20th century.\nMost of the coffee exported was transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas. Since the main market for the coffee was in Europe, it soon became a high priority to develop a transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government asked U.S. businessman Minor C. Keith to build a railroad to the Caribbean port of Lim\u00f3n. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.\nMost Afro-Costa Ricans come from Jamaican immigrants who worked on the railway. United States convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also worked in the construction of the railroad.\nIn exchange for making the railroad, Costa Rican gave Keith large amounts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas became the largest export. The United Fruit Company began to hold a major role in the national economy.\n20th century.\nCosta Rica has enjoyed greater peace and political stability than other Latin American nations.\nBut in 1917\u201319, General Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown. The unpopularity of Tinoco's government led to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military.\nIn 1948, Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising between the previous president Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia (he served as president between 1940 and 1944) and Otilio Ulate Blanco. With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day Costa Rican Civil War was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century.\nThe victorious rebels formed a government that abolished the military. It oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly. Having enacted these reforms, the junta relinquished its power on November 8, 1949, to the new democratic government. After that, Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest in 2014. All of them have been widely regarded by the international community as peaceful and transparent.\nGeography.\nCosta Rica is on the Central American isthmus. It is between latitudes 8\u00b0 and 12\u00b0N, and longitudes 82\u00b0 and 86\u00b0W. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It has a total of of coastline. Costa Rica also borders Nicaragua to the north ( of border) and Panama to the southeast ( of border). In total, Costa Rica has plus of territorial waters.\nThe highest point in the country is Cerro Chirrip\u00f3, at . The largest lake in Costa Rica is Lake Arenal.\nClimate.\nCosta Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the Equator. The climate is tropical all year. The country has many microclimates depending on elevation, rainfall, and the geography of each region.\nCosta Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls. It does not have the four seasons other countries have. The year can be split into two seasons: the dry season (known as summer), and the rainy season (known as winter). The \"summer\" starts in December and ends in April. \"Winter\" starts in May and ends in November. During this time it rains constantly in some regions.\nThe location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean. Annual rainfall is over . Humidity is also higher here. The mean annual temperature on the coast is around . in the main populated areas, and below on the highest mountains.\nThere are many national parks in Costa Rica, including Manuel Antonio National Park.\nPlants and animals.\nCosta Rica is home to many plants and animals. The country has only about 0.25% of the world's landmass, but it has 5% of the world's biodiversity. Almost 25% of Costa Rica's land area is in national parks and protected areas. This is the largest percentage of protected areas in the world.\nCosta Rica successfully reduced deforestation. It had one of the worst deforestation rates in the world from 1973 to 1989. But it was almost zero by 2005.\nThe Corcovado National Park is internationally known by ecologists for its biodiversity. Visitors can see many different types of animals. An example is the big cats and tapirs. Corcovado is the only park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkeys can be found. These include the white-headed capuchin, the mantled howler,the endangered Geoffroy's spider monkey and the Central American squirrel monkey. The squirrel monkey is found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and a small part of Panama.\nTortuguero National Park is home to spider, howler, and white-throat Capuchin monkeys. It is also the home of three-toed sloth and two-toed sloth. It has 320 species of birds and many reptiles. There is an annual nesting of the endangered green turtle, and is the most important nesting site for the species. Giant leatherback, hawksbill, and loggerhead turtles also nest here.\nThe Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is home to almost 2,000 plant species. Including many orchids. It is also home to more than 400 types of birds. There are more than 100 species of mammals here.\nCosta Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and amphibians. They have the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (\"Ctenosaura similis\").\nProvinces, cantons, and districts.\nArticle 168 of the Constitution of Costa Rica says the political divisions are classified into 3 groups: provinces, cantons, and districts.\nCosta Rica has seven provinces. The provinces are divided into 81 cantons. The canton is directed by a mayor. Mayors are chosen democratically every four years by the canton's people. There are no provincial legislatures. The cantons are further divided into 463 districts.\nThe provinces are:\nSports.\nCosta Rica entered the Summer Olympics for the first time in 1936 with the fencer Bernardo de la Guardia. They entered the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1980 with the skier Arturo Kinch. All four of Costa Rica's Olympic medals were won by the sisters Silvia and Claudia Poll in swimming. Claudia won the country's only gold medal in 1996.\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Costa Rica. The national team has played in four FIFA World Cup tournaments. They reached the quarter-finals for the first time in 2014. Its best performance in the regional CONCACAF Gold Cup was runner-up in 2002."}

Two of the five Great Lakes and four other states (Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota) border Wisconsin. The capital of Wisconsin is Madison. The biggest city in Wisconsin is Milwaukee.\nHistory.\nNative Americans first settled in Wisconsin before the arrival of Europeans.\nOrigins.\nThe word \"Wisconsin\" comes from the name that one of the Algonquian speaking American Indian groups living in the area gave to the Wisconsin River. They named the Wisconsin River at the time that the European contact happened. Jacques Marquette, a French , was the first European (or person from Europe) to get to the Wisconsin River and write down the name. He reached the Wisconsin River in 1673. He wrote the name of the river as \"Meskousing\" in his journal. Over time, other explorers from France this name into \"Ouisconsin\". This is now the French name for the Wisconsin River. As of 1845, the government of the Wisconsin Territory gave the name \"Wisconsin\" to the Wisconsin River.\nCulture.\nMany people in Wisconsin go skiing, ice fishing and to snowmobile races. The Major League Baseball's Milwaukee Brewers are popular. Music events include the Summerfest. There is the Milwaukee Art Museum. Circle Sanctuary is the largest Wiccan organization in the U.S.\nGeography.\nThe Montreal River flows along the border of Wisconsin. Lake Superior and Michigan border Wisconsin to the north. Lake Michigan is to the east of Wisconsin, and Illinois is found directly south of Wisconsin. Other rivers that make up the border of Wisconsin include the Mississippi River and St. Croix Rivers to the west and the Menominee River to the northeast.\nWisconsin has a lot of different kinds of geography and is very diverse. Wisconsin is made up of five main areas of geography. The Lake Superior Lowland to the north is an area of land that is right against Lake Superior. The Northern Highland area of Wisconsin is to the south of the Lake Superior Lowland. This area contains trees and other kinds of forests. The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (1,500,000 acres big), is found in this area. The highest point in Wisconsin, Timms Hill, is in the Northern Highland area. The Central Plain area is found in the central part of Wisconsin. Lots of sandstone , such as the Dells of the Wisconsin River, are found in the Central Plain area. The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands area is found in the southeastern part of Wisconsin. Many of the biggest cities in Wisconsin are in the Eastern Ridges and Lowlands area. The Western Upland area is in the southwestern part of the state. This area includes features like bluffs along the Mississippi River and forests and farmland (land put aside for farming).\nClimate.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Wisconsin was in the Wisconsin Dells. It was recorded on July 13, 1936. The temperature reached 120\u00a0\u00b0F (46\u00a0\u00b0C). The lowest temperature in Wisconsin ever written down was in the village of Couderay. The temperature there was only \u201355\u00a0\u00b0F (-48\u00a0\u00b0C). This was recorded on both February 2 and February 4, 1996.\nCities and towns.\nWisconsin has cities and towns of many different sizes. Nearly 70 percent of people living in Wisconsin live in urban areas (cities like Madison and Milwaukee). 33 percent of the population of Wisconsin lives in the Greater Milwaukee area. Milwaukee is found at the northern end of a string of cities and towns along Lake Michigan. With almost 600,000 people living in Milwaukee, that makes Milwaukee the 22nd-largest city in the country. Madison is also another important city in Wisconsin. With a population of just over 225,000 people, it is a city that grows very fast. A suburb of Madison, Middleton, was also ranked the \"Best Place to Live in America\" in 2007 by \"CNN Money\". There are a bunch of medium-sized cities and towns (meaning their populations are between 25,000 and 100,000 people) in Wisconsin. 12 cities in Wisconsin with a population of 50,000 or more."}

Tel Aviv is a part of an area of cities called Gush Dan. About 3,850,000 people live in this urban area.\nThe city calls itself Israel's capital of culture, economy and trade.\nHistory.\nIn 1909, Jewish people started building Tel Aviv northeast of Jaffa. Tel Aviv was part of Jaffa at first, but it became a separate town in 1921. Tel Aviv grew quickly as Jewish immigrants arrived, mainly from Europe.\nBetween the years 1925-1929 the Scottish city planner Sir Patrick Geddes was design the first city plan for Tel Aviv.\nIn the early 1930s the area of the Yarkon River mouth has began to develop with the opening of the international trade fair - the \"Orient Fair\" and the opening of the \"Tel Aviv Port\" beside him. from the other side of the Yarkon River was built the Reading Power Station and the Sde Dov Airport.\nIt was Israel's first capital when the nation was established in 1948. The capital was moved to Jerusalem in 1949, but the Israeli Ministry of Defense and many foreign embassies stayed in Tel Aviv. Most Israeli government departments have offices in Tel Aviv.\nIn 1950, Tel Aviv and Jaffa (called \"Yafo\" in Hebrew) joined to into the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo. Tel Aviv-Yafo is the official name of the city, but it is almost always called Tel Aviv.\nTel Aviv continued to grow quickly in the 1950s and 1960s. The fast growth of the Tel Aviv area caused problems such as air pollution, slums, and traffic that took until the 2000s to fix. Most of the people of Tel Aviv live in apartment buildings.\nDuring the Persian Gulf War of 1991, Iraq fired about 25 missiles toward Tel Aviv.

Some of the definitions in trigonometry are:\nTrigonometric ratios.\nThere are three main trigonometric ratios for right triangles, and three reciprocals of those ratios, making up a total of 6 ratios. They are:\nThe reciprocals of these ratios are:\nCosecant (cosec) - The cosecant of an angle is equal to the formula_4 or formula_5.\nSecant (sec) - The secant of an angle is equal to the formula_6 or formula_7.\nCotangent (cot) - The cotangent of an angle is equal to the formula_8 or formula_9.\nStudents often use a mnemonic to remember this relationship. The \"sine\", \"cosine\", and \"tangent\" ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them as strings of letters, such as SOH-CAH-TOA:\nThe use of trigonometry.\nWith the sines and cosines, one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. This is called \"solving\" the triangle. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle, as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since \"every polygon may be described as a combination of triangles\".\nTrigonometry is also vital in surveying, in vector analysis, and in the study of periodic functions. It developed from a need to compute angles and distances in fields such as astronomy, mapmaking, surveying, and artillery range finding.\nThere is also such a thing as spherical trigonometry, which deals with spherical geometry.

About 2 million people live in the . For a short time in New Zealand's history it was the capital city. Now Wellington is the capital city.\nAuckland is in the north of the North Island. It is on two harbours: the Manukau and Waitemata harbours. It is known as the \"City of Sails\" because there are many sailing boats in the city. The Hauraki Gulf has many different islands and provides safe anchorage and good sailing that is recognised around the world. It has a temperate oceanic climate (\"Cfb\" in the Koeppen climate classification).\nAuckland is built on a series of dormant volcanos. The youngest and largest of these is called Rangitoto. Rangitoto is an island just a few kilometres from the city centre. It has many pohutukawas, native trees also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree because of their brilliant red flowers which bloom in December.\nIn 2010, Len Brown became the 1st Mayor of Auckland. In 2016, he was replaced by Phil Goff.\nClimate.\nAccording to the NIWA, Auckland has a subtropical climate, with warm, humid summers and mild, rainy winters. Under K\u00f6ppen's climate classification, the city has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\"). It is the warmest main centre of New Zealand and is also one of the sunniest, with an average of over 2000 sunshine hours per annum. The average daily maximum temperature is in February and in July. The absolute maximum recorded temperature is , while the absolute minimum is . High levels of rainfall occur almost year\u2013round with an average of per year spread over 136 rain days, but is most frequent in Winter. Snowfall in Auckland is extremely rare; recorded instances include 27 July 1939 and 15 August 2011, although without any accumulation.\nThe early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: \"In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning. At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails...\". Many Aucklanders use this time of day to walk and run in parks.\nAuckland occasionally suffers from air pollution due to fine particle emissions. There are also occasional breaches of guideline levels of carbon monoxide. While maritime winds normally disperse the pollution relatively quickly it can sometimes become visible as smog, especially on calm winter days. The west of Auckland is slightly wetter and cooler than the eastern side, with the gulf islands being warmer and drier still."}
{"id": "12446", "revid": "821211", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12446", "title": "Capitalism", "text": "Capitalism is an economic system. In it the government plays a secondary role. People and companies make most of the decisions, and own most of the property. Goods are usually made by individuals who work for companies that produce the goods. The companies then sell what is made by the individuals and make a profit. The means of production are largely or entirely privately owned (by individuals not making the goods or companies) and operated for profit.\nMost property, for example, is owned by people or companies, not by the government or by the workers. Capitalism has a more or less free market economy, which means that prices move up or down according to the availability of the products. People buy and sell things according to their own judgment. In most countries there is some regulation (trade laws) and some planning done by the government. They are sometimes called \"mixed economies\" to indicate this. Some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea, or how much of capitalism is a good idea.\nThe word comes from \"capital\", meaning something of value. This can be money (\"financial capital\") or any other goods that can be traded. The word \"capital\" originally comes from the Latin word \"caput\", meaning \"head.\" It was used to mean how many \"head\" of cattle a rich person owned, in days long ago when cattle were used as money. In fact, the words \"capital\" and \"cattle\" both come from \"caput\".\nThe philosopher Adam Smith's book, \"The Wealth of Nations\", was an important book that developed the ideas of capitalism and the free market. The word \"capitalism\" was not used until the 19th century. The greatest invention of capitalism is often said to be the joint stock company. A joint-stock company is a business where different stocks can be bought and owned by shareholders. Each shareholder owns company stock in proportion to the number of their shares.\nBuying, selling, working, and hiring.\nIn capitalism, people may sell or lend their property, and other people may buy or borrow it. If one person wants to buy, and another person wants to sell to them, they do not need to get permission from higher power. People can have a market (buying and selling with each other) without anyone else telling them to. People who own capital are sometimes called \"capitalists\" (people who support capitalism are called capitalists, too). They can hire anyone who wants to work in their factories, shops or lands for them for the pay they offer.\nThe word \"capital\" can be used to mean things that produce more things or money. For example, lands, factories, shops, tools and machines are capital. If someone has money that can be \"invested\", that money is capital too.\nIn capitalist systems, many people are workers (or \"proletarians\"). They are employed to earn money for living. People can choose to work for anyone who will hire them in a free market.\nThis is different from many older economic systems. In \"feudalism\", most people were \"serfs\" and had to work for the people who owned the land they lived on. In \"mercantilism\", the government makes it hard to buy things from other countries. In many countries with \"mixed economies\" (part capitalism and part socialism) there are laws about what you can buy or sell, or what prices you can charge, or whom you can hire or fire.\nInvesting.\nAn \"investment\" is when people invest (give) their money in things. People can put their money together to buy or build things, even if they are too big for one person to make alone. The people who invest get to be the owners of what they buy or build together. The stock market lets people buy and sell investments.\nInvesting is important to capitalism. The word \"capitalist\" can mean two things: it can mean someone who likes capitalism; but it can also mean someone who invests. For example, a \"venture capitalist\" invests in new businesses.\nPeople who start businesses, or invest in businesses, can make a lot of money. A business sells things that people want. The investors make extra money, which is called \"profit\". Investors can take their profit and invest it in more businesses, or in making the business bigger. The investors can get more and more profit if the businesses are successful.\nPeople who disagree.\n\"Socialists\" and \"communists\" are people who do not support capitalism. They say it hurts workers, because businesses make more money by selling things than they pay the workers who make the things. Business owners become rich while workers remain poor and exploited (taken advantage of). They also argue society would be more efficient if people thought less about competing against one another for their own interests and thought more of working together for the overall good of society. Another argument is that each person has a right to basic needs (such as food and shelter). Within capitalism, sometimes people might not get everything they need to live. Capitalism is also said to be the main culprit of economic inequality.\nKarl Marx was a famous communist philosopher from Germany. He wrote a famous book called \"The Capital\" (or \"Das Kapital\" in German). He said that capitalism would go away after workers decided to take over the government in a revolution because of the exploitation. There were violent communist revolutions in many countries. Many people were killed because of this. But capitalism did not go away, and most of these communist systems have collapsed and do not exist today, or else they have become more capitalist. Some people think that communism in those countries did not work because Marx's ideas, though nice in thought, did not really work. Others think that communist countries collapsed because of the attacks (military, political and economic) from capitalist countries.\nAnarchists (that are not anarcho-capitalists) do not support capitalism either. They do not think there should be any bosses because it is a hierarchy. They think that Marxist\u2013Leninist governments were unsuccessful because they were dictatorships that said that they would rule in the name of workers, but ruled in the name of their leaders. They think that these governments were state capitalist and not socialist.\nPeople who agree.\nThere are different words for people who support capitalism. In many parts of the world, these people are called either \"conservatives\" or \"liberals\". In the United States, the word liberal means someone who supports capitalism but wants some rules on what the market can do and cannot do. \"Libertarian\" is a word that in America and some other countries means someone who wants the government to have little or no power to tell people what to buy or sell.\nThe reasons for capitalism are not just economic. They are political. People who like capitalism believe that capitalism provides liberty by the citizen by allowing them to be independent. Friedrich Hayek agreed with this and connected the open society with respect for the individual, and tolerance for the differences between people.\nAnother argument for the endorsement of capitalism is that it is arguably better than other economic models, like communism, for example. While most communist nations (such as the Soviet Union and Democratic Kampuchea) collapsed deep in poverty, hunger, dictatorships and/or genocides, capitalist countries (such as the United States and the UK) prospered economically.\nPeople who support capitalism also have disagreements. Most people agree that capitalism works better if the government keeps people from stealing other people's things. If people could steal anything, then nobody would want to buy anything. However, if people shared everything, then no one would need to buy anything.\nIn most countries, the government does more than that. It tries to make sure that people buy and sell fairly and that employment is fair. But most of the time, the government making sure that employment is fair is also on the benefitting side of capitalism. The government takes money in taxes and spends it according to what the governing body wants, often not what the citizens who elected the governing body want their taxes to be spent on. People in power spend money on guns and ships for the military. When the government is in charge of part of the economy, this is called a \"social democracy.\" However, when the government spends money it causes arguments about what the money should be spent on, because often times we don't vote on policies, we vote on people we depend on making the policies.\nA few people think that people can protect themselves without any government. Instead of having laws against stealing, people could protect their own things, or agree to pay other people such as arbitrators, insurers, and private defenders to protect them. This belief is called \"anarcho-capitalism.\" These people think that the government is trying to take away their earnings, because it takes taxes away from people against their will and keeps them from making agreements between themselves."}

He was born in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. His father was a Christian minister. Millions of Nat King Cole\u2019s recordings were sold while he was alive. He died of cancer of the lung in February, 1965. He was only forty-five years old. People around the world still enjoy listening to the music of one of America\u2019s greatest performers of popular and jazz music.\nEarly years.\nWhen Cole was four years old, his parents moved the family to North Chicago, Illinois. His younger brother was Freddy Cole. He learned to play the piano when he was very young. His mother was the only piano teacher he ever had. He gave his first public performance when he was four. By the time he was twelve, Cole was playing piano at his father\u2019s church. His father was pastor of the First Baptist church in North Chicago, Illinois for 29 years.\nHis interest in jazz.\nCole played piano in New York City and Los Angeles, California when he was a young man. In 1937, he formed a group that played jazz music. Oscar Moore played the guitar and Wesley Prince played the bass. The trio reportedly did not need a drummer because Cole\u2019s piano playing kept the beat so well. They named the group, The King Cole Trio. At the same time, Cole also changed his name into Nat King Cole. The trio soon became very popular. Nat sang some songs, but mostly played the piano.\nWell-known popular singer.\nBy the middle 1940s, Nat King Cole was beginning to be known as a popular singer as well as a jazz piano player. He was one of the first musicians to record with new Capitol Records.\nThe first song he recorded for Capitol was \u201cStraighten Up and Fly Right.\u201d He wrote the song. The words were based on his father\u2019s teachings. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943. It sold more than 500,000 copies.\nNat recorded hundreds of songs. Some of the most popular include \u201cSweet Lorraine,\u201d \u201cNature Boy,\u201d \u201cThose Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer,\u201d \u201cWhen I Fall in Love,\u201d and \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d In 1950, the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d That song made him famous as a singer.\nNat King Cole also acted in movies. The best known one is \"Saint Louis Blues\". He played the part of the jazz composer W.C. Handy. He also appeared in a movie about himself called \"The Nat King Cole Story\".\nIn the 1950s, he sang with some of the best known orchestras of the time.\nHe received many awards during his life. He also received many more after his death. One was a 1990 Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.\nHis success as a black man.\nBy 1956, Nat King Cole was known internationally. He signed an agreement to perform at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nCole often performed in places that only admitted white people. Black leaders did not like this about him. Cole said he tried to take legal action against those places but often failed.\nCole earned more money and moved to California. He bought a house in an area where white people lived. At that time, many white Americans did not want to live near blacks. White home owners nearby protested the purchase of a house by a black family. Cole and his family refused to leave and lived in the house without problems.\nCole was the first black man to have his own television program. His program began on NBC Television in 1956. NBC agreed to support \"The Nat King Cole Show\" for a while. It hoped American companies would pay to sell their products on the program. However, major companies were not willing to advertise on a program that had a black performer. They believed that white people in the southern part of the United States would not buy their products. Many Americans watched the show, but NBC stopped production after a year.\nHis family.\nNat King Cole was married two times. In 1936, he married a dancer, Nadine Robinson. Their marriage failed. In 1948, he married Maria Ellington. They had three children. They also adopted and raised two other children.\nNat\u2019s daughter, Natalie followed her father as a singer. She recorded many songs after her father died. In 1991, Natalie Cole recorded an album called \"Unforgettable\". It contains 22 of Nat King Cole\u2019s songs, including the song \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d Modern technology made it possible to mix her voice with a recording of her father singing the same song."}

Gershwin, his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city, but he did not like school or studying.\nWhile exploring the city, Gershwin heard jazz and blues music spilling out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. Gershwin began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized Gershwin's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: \"I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt.\"\nYounger days as a student.\nGershwin studied classical piano, and he was a first-rate pianist,but his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. He loved playing piano and it was his passion. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business. The New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called \"Tin Pan Alley.\"\nThe phonograph and radio had been invented in the late 1800s. But it would be many years before there were musical recordings or regular radio broadcasts. Tin Pan Alley publishers needed another way to sell new songs, so they employed people to play the piano to do this.\nThe piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only 18 years old. It had a long title: \"When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get \u2018Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em. \"\nSuccess as a songwriter.\nGershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. \"There is plenty more where that came from,\" he said.\nGershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called \"Swanee.\" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. \"Swanee\" was made into one of the first musical recordings. Gershwin was suddenly famous. He also was in the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nMusic critics note that \"Swanee\" is not like most of Gershwin's music. Later, he wrote true love songs. Some were light and funny. Some were full of intense feeling. Many of these songs were written for the popular musical theater. One of his most emotional love songs never became part of a musical play, however. It is called \"The Man I love.\" The song was sung by the Francine Evans role [played by Liza Minnelli in Martin Scorsese's film, New York, New York] and supposedly 'written' by her character for her soon to be husband, Jimmy Doyle [superbly played by Robert De Niro], of the Jimmy Doyle Orchestra. His character also 'wrote' the title song, New York, New York, who was actually written by Fred Ebb, music by Kanter, his partner. The song became New York's official anthem in 1985.\nHis brother Ira.\nGershwin's older brother, Ira, wrote the words to \"The Man I Love\". As George became famous, Ira wrote the words to more and more of his songs.\nThe two brothers were very different. Ira, the writer, was quiet and serious. George, the musician, was outgoing\u2014the life of any party. When they had to finish a new musical Ira locked George in a hotel room until it was done. But George wrote better songs with Ira than with anyone else.\nMusic of Gershwin.\nAs a songwriter.\nOne of many examples of the Gershwin's combined work is the song \"They Can't Take That Away From Me.\" The Gershwins wrote the song for dancer and actor Fred Astaire for the film \"Shall We Dance.\" That was George and Ira Gershwin's first movie musical.\nMany of George Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theaters in New York City. These comedies, with plenty of songs, were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s.\nOne of Gershwin's musical plays, \"Girl Crazy,\" introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman. She became one of the most celebrated performers in America. In the play, Merman sang a song George Gershwin wrote just for her. It was called \"I Got Rhythm\".\nMany songs that George Gershwin wrote for musical plays and movies have remained as popular as ever. Over the years, they have been sung and played in every possible way\u2014from jazz to country.\nOne example is the song, \"Someone to Watch Over Me.\" It was written for the 1926 musical \"Oh, Kay!\"\nJazz and his music.\nIn the nineteen twenties, there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music?\nIn 1924, jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized how little time he had to do it. The concert was just a few weeks away. Gershwin got busy, and, in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra. He called it \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"\nGershwin himself played the piano part of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" at the concert. The audience included some of the greatest classical musicians of the time. When they heard his music, they were electrified. It seemed to capture, for the first time, the true voice of modern American culture. Today, we can still hear Gershwin playing \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" An old mechanical piano recording Gershwin created has been reproduced exactly. There are also very early versions of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" which feature Gershwin playing the piano with Whiteman's orchestra. Those recordings, because they are early, do not sound like modern recordings. But they are recordings of Gershwin at the piano. This makes those recordings important.\n\"Rhapsody in Blue\" made George Gershwin famous all over the world. Several hundred thousand copies of the printed music sold immediately. Gershwin was satisfied that he had shown that jazz music could be both serious and popular.\nMusical works and opera.\nGershwin also wrote an opera, \"Porgy and Bess. \" It was based on a book by DuBose Heyward. It is a tragic love story about black Americans along the coast of South Carolina.\n\"Porgy And Bess\" opened in Boston, Massachusetts in 1935. Audiences loved it. But most critics did not know what to think of it. It was not like any other opera or musical play they had ever seen.\nGershwin did not care about the critics' opinions. He believed some of his greatest music had gone into the opera. He said he had created a new musical form\u2014an opera based on popular culture. Today \"Porgy And Bess\" is considered a masterpiece.\nAnother well-known Gershwin piece is \"An American in Paris. \" It is a long tone poem for orchestra. Its first public performance was by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1928.\nOnce again, opinion was mixed. Most people loved \"An American in Paris,\" as they loved all of Gershwin's music. Some critics liked it, too. They called it happy and full of life. Others hated it. They called it silly and long-winded.\nLast days.\nGeorge Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He died while having surgery to remove the brain tumor. He was only thirty-eight years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. Everyone mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have written. Gershwin is still considered one of America's greatest composers. His works still are performed by many singers and groups. They are probably performed more often than any other serious American composer.\nAustrian composer Arnold Schoenberg was one of the people who praised George Gershwin. Schoenberg said Gershwin was a man who lived in music and expressed everything through music, because music was his native language."}

He wrote music for the orchestra, piano, and voice. He wrote music for plays, movies, and dance. Copland also was a conductor, pianist, speaker, teacher, and writer.\nMusic critics say Copland taught Americans about themselves through his music. He used parts of many old American folksongs in his work. He wanted to do this after studying music in France. He said that composers there had a very French way of writing music. He said Americans had nothing like that in this country. So he decided to compose music that was truly American.\nEarly days of Copland.\nAaron Copland was born November 14, 1900 in Brooklyn, New York. He died at the age of 90 on December 2, 1990. He was the youngest of five children. His parents had come to the United States from eastern Europe. They owned a store in Brooklyn. Aaron began playing the piano when he was a young child. He wrote his first song for his mother when he was eight years old. His dreams of becoming a composer began when he was young. When he was sixteen, he asked his parents to let him study composing with Rubin Goldmark. Goldmark had taught the composer George Gershwin.\nWhen he was in his early twenties, Copland went to Paris, France, where he studied music with Nadia Boulanger. She was one of the most important music teachers of the time. He returned to New York in 1924.\nKnown classical works.\nThe famous conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, learned about Copland's music. Koussevitzky led the orchestra for the first performance of Copland's early work, \"Music for the Theater\", in 1925. Koussevitzky also conducted Copland's \"Concerto for Piano and Orchestra\" in 1927. This work was unusual because Copland used ideas from jazz music in his concerto.\nCopland later wrote the music for two ballets about the American West. One was about the life of a famous gunfighter called Billy the Kid. Copland used music from American cowboy songs in this work. This piece from \"Billy the Kid: Ballet Suite\" is called \"Street in a Frontier Town\".\nIn 1942, the conductor Andre Kostelanitz asked Copland to write music about a great American, Abraham Lincoln. Copland wrote \"Lincoln Portrait\" to honor America's 16th president. Copland's music included parts of American folk songs and songs popular during the American Civil War. He added words from President Lincoln's speeches and letters.\n\"Lincoln Portrait\" has been performed many times in America. Many famous people have done the speaking part.Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was one of them. Here, actor James Earl Jones performs in Copland's \"Lincoln Portrait.\"\nIn 1942 the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra asked 18 composers to write music expressing love for America. For the competition, Copland composed \"Fanfare for the Common Man. \" This music is played in America during many national events, including some presidential inaugurations (when they become presidents).\nExperts say \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" was an example of the way Copland changed the kind of music he wrote during the 1940s. He began writing music that was more easily understood and more popular. Copland wrote about this in 1941 in his book, \"Our New Music\".\nHe wrote that the radio and record player was helping people who had never listened to music before to enjoy music. He said that there was no reason to continue writing music as if these things had not been invented. So he decided to write music in a simpler way.\nHis interest and activities beyond music.\nCopland spread his ideas about music in other ways. He taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City and at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One of the many awards he received was the Pulitzer Prize. He won it in 1945 for his famous music for a ballet called \"Appalachian Spring.\" It is one of his most popular works. The last part of the ballet is based on a traditional song, \"A Gift to be Simple\".\nCopland also wrote music for several major movies. He won an Academy Award in 1950 for composing the music for the movie \"The Heiress\". Then he began experimenting with what is called the twelve-tone system. His music was no longer as easy to understand, nor as popular.\nCopland stopped composing at the end of the 1960s. Yet he continued to be active as a conductor and speaker. In 1982, Queens College of the City University of New York established the Aaron Copland School of Music.\nCopland was a strong supporter of liberal ideas. In the early 1950s, he and other famous writers, actors and intellectuals were accused of supporting communism. Public opinion changed, though. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is America's highest award to civilians. Aaron Copland died in 1990 at the age of 90. But his music lives on.\nThe article above is a reuse and modification from a script available as public domain under Terms of Use &amp; Privacy Notice of Voice of America."}

It is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard. Examples are:\nwaist, die, noise, road, house, fierce, bear, sure. Each of these is a different vowel sound.\nA monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make, like the \"oo\" sound in \"book.\" In a diphthong, the person combines two different monophthongs, as with the \"oi\" sound in the word \"oil\". The speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an \"o\" sound, then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard \"e\" sound. Another example is the \"ou\" sound in the word \"house\". The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft \"a\" sound in \"flat\", then moves to make the a hard \"oo\" sound like the one in \"caboose\".\nJust like with every other part of language, the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents.\nThe word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language. Here, \"di\" means \"two\" or \"double\", while the part \"-phthong\" means \"sound\" or \"tone\", from the basic word \"phthalein\", which means \"speak\", \"creating sound by the voice\". \nA diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable, but rarely.

Comedian Drew Carey is now the host; his first episode aired in October 2007.\nIn this game, a person uses his shopping skills to correctly guess the price of different products, like in a market. Some products are simple household items, like toothpaste and vitamins. Other items are more expensive products, like furniture and cars. After the third and sixth games, the \"Showcase Showdown\" is played. The three players who got on stage in both halves of the show spin a wheel. They get two spins of the wheel. They have to be closest to $1.00 without going over. The person with the highest total moves on to the Showcase at the end of the show. If a player gets $1.00, they win $1,000 and get another spin. If they hit the $1.00 space on that spin, they win another $25,000. If they hit the 5\u00a2 or 15\u00a2 space, they win another $10,000. In the Showcase, the winners of the two Showcase Showdown games are shown prize packages. They make a bid on them, and whoever comes closest to the price of their showcase without going over wins it. If they are $250 or less from the price of their showcase, they win both showcases. If someone's bid was higher than the price of the real price, that person went over, and was disqualified from winning in that round.\nFrom 1956 - 1963, the show aired on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen.

Many animals such as some insects, some reptiles, crocodiles, salamanders, and small birds can see things that this light. UV is a common abbreviation of ultraviolet, mainly used in technical contexts.\nUltraviolet is beyond the visible violet light in terms of frequency, wavelength, and energy. Its wavelengths are between about 10 nanometers (nm) to about 400 nanometers. Frequency and wavelength are closely related. The equation that shows this relationship is: \u03bd = c/\u03bb . Saying that something has a short wavelength is the same as saying that it has a high frequency.\nUltraviolet radiation.\nUltraviolet light is a type of ionizing radiation. It can damage or kill cells. Any electromagnetic radiation (light) that has a wavelength shorter than 450\u00a0nm may cause trouble. Therefore, humans that live in places with more ultraviolet light have adapted by getting darker skins. Pigments absorb the ultraviolet radiation, so it does not get through the skin to kill or injure cells inside. Injury to the skin by ultraviolet is called \"sunburn.\"\nThe violet light and ultraviolet light differ in their wavelength, frequency, and quantum energy. The differences between ultraviolet light and x-rays are also wavelength, frequency and quantum energy. In the electromagnetic spectrum, ultraviolet is beyond violet, x-rays are beyond ultraviolet, and gamma rays are beyond x-rays.\nElectromagnetic waves with a wavelength from about 400\u00a0nanometers down to about 10\u00a0nanometers are commonly called ultraviolet. Their characteristic photon energy is about 3 to 124 electronvolts.\nAlthough the air of the Earth is transparent to a broad range of ultraviolet, some ultraviolet sunlight is absorbed at a very high altitude by the ozone layer. Recent and ongoing destruction of ozone in high altitudes caused by human influence\u2014mostly by industrial chemicals and air travel\u2014has greatly increased the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the Earth's surface. This, in turn, has increased the risk of skin cancer to mankind, and this risk will only increase with time unless the ozone layer is better protected.\nUltraviolet wavelengths less than 200\u00a0nanometers, X-rays, and gamma rays, are collectively called ionizing radiation since the energy in any such light quantum is high enough to 'kick' an electron out of an atom. This is why these kinds of radiation are dangerous to life. Ultraviolet light is subdivided into three main bands. UV-C has the shortest wavelengths and is dangerous ionizing radiation. Nitrogen and oxygen absorb the UV-C from solar radiation. UV-B has medium wavelength and is less dangerous to living things. The Earth's ozone layer absorbs most of it. UV-A from the Sun gets through the atmosphere entirely. It has wavelength almost as long as visible light, and many animals can see it but humans cannot.\nOrdinary glass does not let radiation through if its wavelength is less than 200\u00a0nanometers, so it acts as a shield against the more dangerous range of ultraviolet light, but some special sorts of glass do not shield as well, including many car windows.\nOne use for ultraviolet radiation is tanning. Use of tanning devices can cause skin cancer because ultraviolet goes through the skin and causes destruction to cells, causing sunburn.\nBecause of the destructive power of ultraviolet light, it can be used to kill germs. Sunlight is a powerful disinfectant.\nPeople need some ultraviolet light to convert cholesterol into vitamin D.\nUltraviolet lamp.\nAn ultraviolet lamp is one that emits mostly ultraviolet light. These germicidal lamps are often used to kill microbes (germs). They can be very powerful, so the people who work around them when they are turned on may need to wear protective glasses and keep their skin covered to avoid injury.\nIn the laboratory pictured, ultraviolet lights are turned on when the workers are gone, so that anything on the table surface will be killed. Besides ultraviolet light, which makes up most of the light produced by these lamps, there is also a little violet and blue light. This lets people know when the ultraviolet lamps are turned on."}

Transsexuals may be male or female. They typically take hormones and often undergo surgeries to support this process. They usually adopt a new name and may legally have their name changed. \nPeople who go from male to female (MTF) are referred to as transsexual women. People who go from female to male (FTM) are referred to as transsexual men.\nWays to go from male to female.\nTranssexual women take female hormones. They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called androgens. Taking estrogen pills makes breasts grow. It does not make beards go away. It does not make voices higher. Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back. This takes a long time and hurts. Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices. Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery. Some transsexual women also get surgery on their genitals. This is called a vaginoplasty. This is done by making a vagina from the skin of their penis, which is turned inside out. Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine. Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger.\nWays to go from female to male.\nTranssexual men take male hormones. This will make their voices lower. It will make a beard grow. It can also stop their menstruation. Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones. \nSome transsexual men have surgery. One surgery is removal of breasts (mastectomy). Some transsexual men also get surgery on their genitals. One surgery is removal of the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy). Some may also get surgery on their outside genitals. One way takes their skin and tissue and makes it into a penis (phalloplasty). Another way takes the clitoris (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is (metoidioplasty). The place where urine comes out (urethra) can be run through the new penis. The phalloplasty looks more like a penis. A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long. Some ways also make a scrotum from the labia. They may also have the vagina taken out or closed.\nDetransitioning.\nVery rarely, some people (called \"detransitioners\") who have changed sex decide this was a mistake and return to living as members of the sex in which they were born.\nSome of the effects of surgery and hormones can be reversed but others are permanent."}

Often, computer viruses are run as a part of other programs. Any program that is affected by the virus is \"infected\". Biological viruses also work that way, as they copy themselves as part of other organisms. This is how the computer virus got its name.\nIn addition to copying itself, a computer virus can also execute instructions that cause harm. For this reason, computer viruses affect security. They are part of malware.\nVery often, the term is also used for other kinds of malware, such as trojan horses and worms. Even though this is wrong, it may be difficult to tell the difference between different kinds of malware; they often occur together, and only an expert may be able to tell them apart. Such programs also fit more than one category.\nComputer viruses are created for a cause, sometimes they are created to spread political messages and they are also created to hack some system files.\nComputer viruses are spread through many ways. Some of the common ways of spreading are through downloads, email attachments, removable hardwares, and so on. Most viruses are very dangerous kind of malware.\nKinds of computer viruses.\nThere are different kinds of computer viruses:\nLimited user rights can limit the spread of a virus.\nIn the beginning, operating systems on personal computers (or PC) did not have the concept of access control. There were no \"users\", everyone could do everything. Modern operating systems have the concept of access control. There can be more than one user and some users may have more \"privileges\" than others. Certain users may only have access to certain files and are unable to access others. Other users may be able to modify or delete certain files. These privileges can be specified for each file.\nThe damage a virus can cause is influenced by the rights the user has; if the user has no rights to write to certain places in the system, the virus will not be able to spread to those places.\nAnother problem is that sometimes the system for rights management may be available, but that it is not used by default. This is the case with systems such as Windows NT or Windows XP, where by default all users have same rights.\nAntivirus software.\nAntivirus software can protect computers against known viruses. Some antivirus software scan files and compare a hash code for each file with its database of hash codes (or \"signature\"). If the code matches, it has likely found a virus. This way of doing things has created some problems. It will only protect against viruses whose hash code is known. The companies that wrote the antivirus need to keep the virus signatures up-to-date and need to give this information to the PC to be protected.\nThere are two possible modes of scanning: Either the file is scanned \"on demand\" (or \"manually\"), or it is scanned when the system registers an access to the file called \"on access\".\nAntivirus software cannot offer full protection, even in the case the virus is known. Some viruses use something called polymorphic code to change their signature every time they move. No matter how many signatures the company has, they will not be able to stop these types of viruses.\nAnother way that antivirus software can protect against viruses is to use heuristics. Instead of knowing each virus by its signature, heuristic antivirus software look at the behavior of other software. If a software does something that seems bad, the antivirus software steps-in to stop it. Since every step needs to be watched, this is a slow way to do things.\n\"Live system\".\nThe best protection against viruses can be obtained by using a system that boots off a read-only medium, such as a compact disc (called CD), digital versatile disc (called DVD), or USB flash drive (called USB) that does not allow write access to hard disk (or other removable media)."}

For instance, you do not say \"funnest,\" or \"interestingest\". Instead, you say \"most fun,\" and \"most interesting.\" \nThis way of making the superlative is used for almost all adjectives ending in \"ing\" (like \"interesting\", \"fascinating\", \"disgusting\" or \"appealing\".)"}

Those who can harness if for good follow a religion known as the Jedi. It is a belief that the force flows through every living thing. In the words of Obi-Wan Kenobi:\nPeople who can control the Force with their minds get a number of psychic powers, such telepathy (reading others thoughts), telekenesis (moving things with their minds), precognition (knowing about things before they happen) and mind control (telling people comands they must follow).\nThe Jedi and the Sith.\nThe Jedi are a group of beings who use the Force to bring peace and harmony to people, planets, and cultures. They are trained to use the force for good purposes. They are sworn enemies with another group called the Sith.\nThe Sith are a group of beings who use the force as a power source; they are trained to use the force to gain ultimate power. The Sith normally use the force to gain power in battles with their enemy who are the Jedi. They also use the force to bring destruction to the universe and anything in their way. They are the antagonists, and they usually use red lightsabers in contrast to the variety of colors used by the Jedi. There are usually only two Sith, a master and an apprentice.\nLightsaber.\nThe lightsaber is a dangerous and powerful weapon used by the Jedi and the Sith. It can be described simply as a light sword. These weapons are very special to a Jedi or Sith. They are custom built to special specifications by the Jedi or Sith. The Sith tend to take a Jedi's lightsaber as a prize if they win the battle. Many epic battles have been fought with lightsabers between the Jedi and the Sith. For the lightsaber to be a weapon it is powered by a special crystal called a kyber crystal.The kyber crystal comes in many different cololrs such as: Red, white, yellow, orange, and many more. The reason it is powerful and dangerous is that when someone touches the blade, one gets burned straight away.\nStory.\nAnakin Skywalker is a young boy who meets Obi-Wan Kenobi and learns the ways of the Force (and to become a Jedi). Although Jedi are not allowed to get married, as an adult, Anakin falls in love with Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala and they get married. Anakin later goes to the Dark Side and turns against Obi-Wan Kenobi and the rest of the Jedi. Then Palpatine renames him Darth Vader. Before he turned against his wife, Anakin had two children with Senator Amidala, Leia and Luke Skywalker, that he does not know about. Senator Amidala dies after giving birth to their twins. After birth, the twins are separated to prevent Vader and the Dark Side from finding and hurting the children. Obi-Wan Kenobi sends Luke to a planet called Tatooine to live with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Leia is raised by Senator Bail Organa of the planet Alderaan; she is called Princess Leia Organa.\nWhen they get older, Luke and Leia meet again. At first they don't know that they are brother and sister, but they eventually find out. They help fight the evil government, called the Galactic Empire. Luke also learns the ways of the Jedi from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. In the end, they defeat the Empire, with the help of the Rebellion, and Luke helps his father Anakin become good again. Unfortunately, Anakin dies. The galaxy is then saved for a while.\nThirty years later, however, the Empire rises again in the form of the First Order. However, the New Republic does not believe that it is a threat. Those who do believe form the Resistance, led by Leia. Luke has vanished, and Leia has married Han Solo. They had a child, named Ben, but Ben was corrupted by the First Order and is now called Kylo Ren. Rey, a desert scavenger, fights with Han against the First Order, but Kylo Ren kills his father.

It tells much about things seen in that movie but from the point of view of the people on the station. A different example is that in the Expanded Universe, sometimes the Sith are shown as the protagonists. Most of the stories in the Expanded Universe are about the rebuilding of the Republic after the Empire's defeat. They are set anywhere from the early Sith Wars which happened 5,000 years before to more than one hundred years after Episode VI.\nMovies.\n\"Star Wars\" original trilogy:\n\"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy:\n\"Star Wars\" sequel trilogy:\nAnthology films:"}

It is spoken by more than 78 million people (most are North or South Koreans).\nIn South Korea, it is called \"hangukmal\" (\ud55c\uad6d\ub9d0) or \"hangugeo\" (Hangeul: \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4, Hanja: \u97d3\u570b\u8a9e). In North Korea, however, it is called \"choseonmal\" (\uc870\uc120\ub9d0) or \"choseoneo\" (\uc870\uc120\uc5b4, \u671d\u9bae\u8a9e). They are named differently because the common names for North and South Korea are different. Additionally, Koreans usually call their language \"urimal\" (Hangeul: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0) or \"urinara mal\" (Hangeul: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ub9d0), meaning \"our language\" or \"our country's language.\"\nWriting.\nKorean uses two different writing systems. One is Hangul, the main alphabet. In North Korea, only Hangeul (Known as Choseongeul in North Korea) is used by law. In South Korea, only Hangeul should be used in most public areas like education, but the other system, Hanja, is still used in some newspapers and professional areas. Hanja is the system of Chinese characters that are used in Korean. It was the only way to write Korean before the creation of Hangeul in the 15th century, and it was common in novels before the 19th century.\nAlthough King Sejong the Great led the development of Hangeul to allow literacy to spread among common people and to create a writing system that represented the language more accurately than Hanja, it was not adopted by the upper classes of Koreans. Hanja would continue to be the official writing system until the late 19th century. Although it was rejected by the elite classes, Hangeul was used often by lower classes as a way to write down Korean literature and for lower classes to communicate."}
{"id": "12647", "revid": "578140", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12647", "title": "Kansas", "text": "Kansas () is a state in the Midwestern United States of America. The name of the state comes from the Kansa Native Americans, whose name comes from a Siouan-language phrase meaning \"people of the south wind\". The land that would become Kansas was bought in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Kansas's capital is Topeka, and its biggest city is Wichita.\nKansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 when Fort Leavenworth was built. In the 1850s, many more people came to live in Kansas. This was also when people were fighting about slavery. People were allowed to move to Kansas in 1854 because of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. When this happened, anti-slavery Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery people from Missouri quickly came to Kansas. They wanted to decide whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Because of this, a lot of fighting happened, and it was known as Bleeding Kansas. The anti-slavery people won. On January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state.\nKansas is in a region known as \"America's Breadbasket\". Like other states in this area, Kansas makes a lot of corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat; they make one-fifth of all wheat grown in the United States. Kansas has other industries too, including aviation and communications. Kansas has an area of , which is the 15th-biggest state by area. Kansas is also 34th most-populous of the 50 states because 2,913,314 people live there. People who live in Kansas are called \"Kansans\". Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest place at .\nThe terrain of Kansas consists of prairies and forests. All of Kansas is in the Great Plains.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Kansas\" comes from the Algonquian term, \"Akansa\", for the Quapaw people. These were a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who moved to Arkansas around the 13th century. The stem -\"kansa\" is named after the Kaw people. They are also known as the \"Kansa\", a federally recognized Native American tribe.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 1539, Marcos de Niza, a friar, reported rumors of C\u00edbola, a city of gold, to Spanish colonial officials in Mexico City. Niza said the city was in modern-day New Mexico. In response to the rumors, two years later, Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, with an army of 3000 Spaniards and 8001 Mexicans, marched northward from Culiac\u00e1n in hopes of finding the city. When Coronado did not find the city in New Mexico, he continued northeast into the Mississippi Valley, crossing the present area of Kansas diagonally. This made Conrado and his army the first Europeans to see the Great Plains, including Kansas. Later, Juan de O\u00f1ate also traveled to Kansas in 1601.\nIn 1682, Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, Louis Hennepin and other French leaders took formal control of the Mississippi Valley, including the land that would become Kansas. This land, known as the Louisiana territory, was used to organize trade with Native Americans. In 1763, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain. \nBetween 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into the Spanish Louisiana. The governor Luis de Unzaga 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the indians tribes, among the explorers were Antoine de Marigny and others who continued trading across the Kansas River, especially at its confluence with the Missouri River, tributaries of the Mississippi River.\nHowever, in 1803, Spain receded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. On April 30, 1803, Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. In the early 1800s, Kansas was used to hold Native Americans that were removed from their native lands.\nStatehood.\nOn May 30, 1854, the Congress signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Kansas-Nebraska Act stated that Kansas and Nebraska were both territories of the United States. It also stated that Kansans would vote on the legality of slavery.\nUpon hearing this, about 1,200 armed New Englanders came to Kansas to vote against slavery. However, thousands of southerners, mostly from Missouri, came to vote for slavery. The final vote was to make slavery legal, and Kansas adopted most of Missouri's slave laws. There was fighting between Southerners and Northerners in Kansas. In one fight, John Brown and his men killed five people in the Pottawatomie Massacre. Later, Southerners destroyed Lawrence, Kansas. Kansas was called \"Bleeding Kansas\".\nBetween 1854 and 1861, Kansas proposed four state constitutions. Out of the four proposed constitutions, three did not allow slavery. Finally, in July 1859, Kansas passed the Wyandotte Constitution, which was anti-slavery. The constitution for statehood was sent to the U.S. government in April 1860 to be voted on. The constitution was passed by the House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate. This is because southern voters in the Senate did not like that Kansas would become a state without slavery. In 1861, after the Confederate states formed, the constitution gained approval from the Union, and Kansas became a state.\nKansas in the Civil War.\nFour months after Kansas became a state, the Civil War started. Out of the 381 battles in the Civil War, four were fought in Kansas. Throughout the war, Kansas remained a Union state.\nOn August 21, 1863, William Clarke Quantrill led a force of 300 to 400 Confederates into the town of Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill and his troops burned, looted, and destroyed the anti-slavery town. This battle became known as the Lawrence Massacre. In total, 164 Union soldiers and 40 Confederate soldiers died in the Lawrence Massacre. In the Battle of Mine Creek, on October 25, 1864, Union soldiers attacked Confederates as they were crossing the Mine Creek. The Union surrounded the Confederates, and captured 600 men and two generals. 1,000 Confederate soldiers and 100 Union soldiers died in the battle. In total, 8,500 people from Kansas died or were wounded in the Civil War.\nPost Civil War.\nAfter the Civil War, many free slaves came to Oklahoma and Kansas. In fact, between the years of 1879 and 1881, about 60,000 African Americans came to this region. This is because the slaves wanted economic opportunities, which they believed awaited them in Kansas. African Americans also came to Kansas for better political rights and to escape sharecropping. These people were called \"Exodusters.\"\nRecent history.\nDust Bowl.\nFrom 1930 to 1936, Kansas went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl. During this time, Kansas had little rainfall and high temperatures. Thousands of farmers became very poor and had to move to other parts of the United States. In total, 400,000 people left the Great Plains area. The years from 1930 to 1940 was the only time the population of Kansas went down. The number of people living in Kansas decreased 4.3 percent.\nBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas.\nDuring the 1950s, school segregation was required in fifteen U.S states. However, Kansas was not one of these states. Instead, school segregation was permitted by local option, but only in elementary schools. In 1896, the ruling from \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" stated that segregation was allowed, but equal facilities should be made available for blacks and whites. Often, however, black schools received less funding and had fewer textbooks than white schools.\nFor these reasons, Linda Brown and her family sued the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Brown won the case, and the ruling was to overturn the \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" decision. This was considered by many a landmark case in the civil rights movement.\nGeography.\nKansas is the 15th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of 82,282 square miles (213,109\u00a0km2). Of this, about 462 square miles (1196.57\u00a0km2) are water. This makes up 0.60% of the total area of the state.\nKansas shares borders with Nebraska to the north, Oklahoma to the south, Missouri to the east, and Colorado to the west. Kansas is just as far away from the Pacific Ocean as it is the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic center of the main 48 states is near Lebanon, Kansas. The geographic center of Kansas is in Barton County.\nGeology.\nThe underground of Kansas is made of dipping sedimentary rocks, and they are slightly slanted west. A series of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian rocks are found in the eastern and southern parts of the state. In the western part of Kansas, Cretaceous can be found sticking up from the ground. This happened because of the erosion from the geologically uplifted Rocky Mountains west of Kansas. Northeastern Kansas was affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene.\nTopography.\nAll of Kansas is in the Great Plains, where the land is mostly flat with prairies and grasslands. Eastern Kansas has hills and forests, like the Flint Hills and the Osage Plains in the southeastern part of the state.\nKansas increases in elevation from east to west. The highest place in the state is Mount Sunflower near the Colorado border. Mount Sunflower is 4,039\u00a0ft (1,231\u00a0m)\u2009tall. The lowest point is the Verdigris River in Montgomery County, at 679\u00a0ft (207\u00a0m) above sea level. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state \u2013 in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek study famously said the state is \"flatter than a pancake\". Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of . This makes Kansas the 23rd flattest U.S. state.\nRivers.\nAbout of the Kansas's northeastern border is the Missouri River. The Kansas River is created by the junction of the Smoky Hill River and Republican River. This happens at Junction City. The Kansas River then joins the Missouri River at Kansas City. It goes across the northeastern part of the state.\nThe Arkansas River (pronunciation varies) starts in Colorado. It goes for about across the western and southern parts of Kansas.\nKansas's has other rivers. There is the Saline River and the Solomon River. They are tributaries of the Smoky Hill River. The Big Blue River, the Delaware River, and the Wakarusa River flow into the Kansas River. The Marais des Cygnes River is a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is between Riverton and Baxter Springs.\nNational parks and historic places.\nAreas under the protection of the National Park Service include:\nPlants and animals.\nIn Kansas, there are currently 238 species of rare animals and 400 rare plants. Among those include: \"Boechera laevigata\", Virginia Rail, Cleft Ledge, Royal Fern, Turkey-tangle, Bobolink, Cave Salamander, Peregrine Falcon, and Black-footed ferret. Common animal species and grasses include: Crows, Deer, Lesser Prairie Chicken, Mice, Moles, Opossum, Prairie Dogs, Raccoon, \"Tripsacum dactyloides\", Prairie Dropseed, Indian Grass, Little Bluestem, Switch Grass, Northern Sea Oats, Tussock Sedge, Sideoats Grama, and Big Bluestem.\nWeather.\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification says that Kansas's climate has three types depending on where in the state it is: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern 2/3 of the state (especially the northeastern part) has a humid continental climate. This means it has cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation happens during both the summer and the spring.\nThe western 1/3 of the state \u2013 from about U.S. Route 83 to west of it \u2013 has a semiarid steppe climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters vary a lot. Winters can be anything between warm and very cold. The western region gets an average of about of precipitation per year. Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the range.\nThe far south-central and southeastern parts of Kansas, including the Wichita area, have a humid subtropical climate. This means it has hot and humid summers, and it has milder winters. It also has more precipitation than other places in Kansas. Some things about three climates can be found in most of Kansas. Many parts can get droughts and varied weather. Places can be dry or humid. Places can get both warm or cold in the winter.\nTemperatures in many areas in the western half of Kansas reach or hotter on most days of June, July, and August. Because of the high humidity, the heat index can be deadly, especially in Wichita, Hutchinson, Salina, Russell, Hays, and Great Bend. Temperatures are often high in Dodge City, Garden City, and Liberal, but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\nTemperatures of or higher are not as common in the eastern half of Kansas. However, higher humidity and the urban heat island effect make most summer days reach between and in Topeka, Lawrence, and the Kansas City metropolitan area. During the summer, the low temperatures each night in the northeastern part of the state don't get colder than very often. Also, because of the humidity being between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat can be felt all day.\nKansas has a varied climate with an average yearly temperature of 56\u00b0F (13\u00b0C). The highest temperature ever in Kansas is 121\u00a0\u00b0F (49.4\u00a0\u00b0C). This happened in Fredonia on July 18, 1936, and in Alton on July 24, 1936. The lowest temperature ever in Kansas is -40\u00a0\u00b0F (-40\u00a0\u00b0C). This occurred in Lebanon on February 13, 1905. Kansas is in a temperate area of the country. Like other states in this region, Kansas has four distinct seasons.\nKansas can have extreme weather in all four seasons. For example, in spring and autumn, Kansas has many tornadoes. In fact, Kansas gets about 55 tornadoes per year. This is because Kansas is in the area known as Tornado Alley, where cold and warm air masses come together to make severe weather.\nIn summer, Kansas has experienced severe droughts. For example, in 1934, 1936, and 1939, Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread dust storms as a part of the Dust Bowl.\nIn winter, Kansas has snow in most parts of the state. The average snowfall in the northern half of the state is 16 inches, with the average snowfall in the southern half of the state being 8\u00a0inches. Blizzards and related snowstorms are rare in Kansas.\nCities and Counties.\nKansas is organized into 105 counties. Each county has a county seat. There are 627 incorporated cities in Kansas.\nWichita is the biggest city in Kansas; it has almost 400,000 people. It is in Sedgwick County, which has about 520,000 people. Sedgwick County has the biggest city in Kansas, but it does not have the most people of any county in Kansas; Johnson County has more than 600,000 people. Johnson County has four of the biggest cities in Kansas: Overland Park, Olathe, Shawnee, and Lenexa. They are all suburbs of nearby Kansas City. Topeka is the capital of Kansas. Lawrence is a college town between Kansas City and Topeka.\nPeople.\nKansas had 627 cities in 2008. The largest city in Kansas is Wichita, which had a population of 382,368 in 2010. The other largest cities in Kansas are: Overland Park, 173,372; Kansas City, 145,786; Topeka, 127,473; and Olathe, 125,872. Between the years of 2000 and 2010, the Kansas population increased 6.1 percent.\nAncestry.\nThe 2010 Census says that the people of Kansas were:\nEthnically 10.5% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race). They are mostly in southwest Kansas. Many black people in Kansas were from the Exodusters, free black people who left the South.\nAs of 2011, 35.0% of Kansas's population younger than one year old were part of a minority group (i.e., did not have two parents who were non-Hispanic white).\nLanguage.\nEnglish is the most-spoken language in Kansas. About 95% of people only speak English. Spanish is second.\nRegions.\nNortheast Kansas.\nThe northeastern part of the state, going from the eastern border to Junction City and from the Nebraska border to south of Johnson County, has more than 1.5\u00a0million people in the Kansas City (Kansas portion), Manhattan, Lawrence, and Topeka metropolitan areas. Overland Park is the biggest city in the county. Johnson County Community College is there, and the corporate campus of Sprint Nextel is also there. In 2006, Overland Park was ranked as the sixth best place to live in America; the nearby city of Olathe was 13th.\nOlathe is the county seat of Johnson County. Olathe, Shawnee, De Soto, and Gardner are some of Kansas's fastest growing cities.\nThere are many universities and colleges in the northeast. Baker University is the oldest university in the state (created in 1858), and it is in Baldwin City. Benedictine College is in Atchison. MidAmerica Nazarene University is in Olathe. Ottawa University is in Ottawa and Overland Park. Kansas City Kansas Community College and KU Medical Center are in Kansas City. The KU Edwards Campus is in Overland Park. Lawrence has the University of Kansas, the biggest public university in Kansas. Lawrence also has Haskell Indian Nations University.\nTopeka is the state capital, and about 250,000 people live in the metropolitan area. Washburn University and Washburn Institute of Technology are in Topeka.\nWichita.\nIn south-central Kansas, the Wichita metropolitan area has over 600,000 people. Wichita is the biggest city in the state in terms of both land area and number of people. 'The Air Capital' is a major manufacturing area for the aircraft industry. It's also where Wichita State University is. Before Wichita was 'The Air Capital' it was a cowtown. Wichita's population growth has grown by more than 10%. The nearby suburbs are some of the fastest growing cities in Kansas. The number of people in Goddard has grown by more than 11% per year since 2000.\nWichita was one of the first cities to add the city commissioner and city manager in their form of government. Wichita is also home of the nationally recognized Sedgwick County Zoo.\nSoutheast Kansas.\nSoutheast Kansas is different in that it was a coal-mining region. It has many places on the National Register of Historic Places. Pittsburg is the biggest city in the region. It is where Pittsburg State University is. Frontenac in 1888 was where one of the worst mine disasters in Kansas happened; an underground explosion killed 47 miners. Fort Scott has a national cemetery. It was designated by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862.\nCentral Kansas.\nSalina is the biggest city in central and north-central Kansas. South of Salina is the small city of Lindsborg. Lindsborg has many Dala horses. Abilene was where President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived. It is where his Presidential Library is. It also has the tombs of the former President, First Lady and son who died in infancy.\nNorthwest Kansas.\nThe city of Hays is the biggest city in the northwest as it has about 20,000 people living there. Hays is where Fort Hays State University is. It also has the Sternberg Museum of Natural History.\nThere are very few people that live west of Hays. There are only two towns that have at least 4,000 people: Colby and Goodland.\nSouthwest Kansas.\nDodge City was famous for the cattle drives it had in the late 19th century. It was built along the old Santa Fe Trail route. The city of Liberal is along the southern Santa Fe Trail route. The first wind farm in the state was built east of Montezuma. Garden City has the Lee Richardson Zoo.\nEconomy.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Kansas's total gross domestic product in 2014 was billion. In 2015, the job growth rate in was .8%. This was one of the lowest rate in America with only \"10,900 total nonfarm jobs\" added that year. The Kansas Department of Labor's 2016 report found the average yearly wage was $42,930 in 2015. In April 2016, the state's unemployment rate was 4.2%.\nThe State of Kansas had a $350 million budget deficit in February 2017. In February 2017, S&amp;P downgraded Kansas's credit rating to AA-.\nThe median household income for Kansas was $47,709 in 2009. The gross domestic product (GDP) for Kansas was $122,700,000,000 ($122.7 billion) in 2008. Overall, Kansas' GDP accounts for less than 1 percent of total U.S. economy.\nKansas has three big military bases: Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth, and McConnell Air Force Base. The US Army reserve has about 25,000 soldiers at these bases, and they also have about 8,000 civilian employees there.\nAgriculture.\n40% of Kansas's economy is farming. In 2017, there were 58,569 farms in Kansas.\nIn 2020, Kansas produced more grain sorghum and wheat than any other state in the United States. Kansas farmers produce about 400 million bushels of wheat per year. Kansas also ranks second in the United States in cropland and silage sorghum, third in cattle and raw meat, and fourth in sunflowers produced. Other agricultural products are cattle, sheep, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, hogs, corn, and salt.\n87.5% of Kansas's land is used for farming. As of 2018, there were 59,600 farms in Kansas, 86 (0.14%) of which are certified organic farms. The size of the average farm in the state is 781 acres (more than a square mile). In 2016, the average cost of running the farm was $300,000.\nIndustry.\nThe industrial products are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, apparel, petroleum, and mining. 4% of Kansas's GDP is from the aviation industry. Many parts of airplanes are made in Wichita. Also, many important companies are near Kansas City, Missouri. For example, the Sprint Nextel Corporation is one of the biggest telephone companies in the United States. Its main operational offices are in Overland Park, Kansas.\nEnergy.\nKansas has many renewable resources. Kansas is one of the biggest producers of wind power in the United States. In 2019, Kansas had an installed capacity of about 6,100\u00a0Megawatts\u00a0(MW) from about 3,200 wind turbines. Wind produced the biggest amount of electricity from the state at 41%. An additional 700\u00a0MW of capacity was scheduled to become available during 2020. Kansas is also one of the biggest national producers of renewable ethanol and biodiesel fuels; Kansas produces about 600\u00a0million gallons per year.\nKansas is eighth in US petroleum extraction. Production has slowly lowered because Kansas's limited economical reserves (especially from the Anadarko Basin) are being . Since oil prices in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained about the same; it had an average monthly rate of about in 2004. The recent higher prices have made carbon dioxide sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\nKansas is also eighth in US natural gas production. Production has slowly lowered since the mid-1990s with the slow depletion of the Hugoton Natural Gas Field\u2014the state's biggest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased coalbed methane production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over .\nTaxes.\nDuring his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor Sam Brownback said he would get rid of the state income tax. In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117. Starting in 2013, the \"ambitious tax overhaul\" lowered income tax, got rid of some corporate taxes, and created pass-through income tax exemptions. He raised the sales tax by one percent to make up for the loss of the other taxes. However, the sales tax was not enough to make up for it. He made cuts to education and some state services to make up for the lost revenue. The tax cut led to years of budget shortfalls. The worst was a $350 million budget shortfall in February 2017. From 2013 to 2017, 300,000 businesses were considered to be pass-through income entities and benefited from the tax exemption. The tax reform \"encouraged tens of thousands of Kansans to claim their wages and salaries as income from a business rather than from employment.\"\nThe economic growth that Brownback hoped for never happened. He argued that it was because of \"low wheat and oil prices and a fewer aircraft sales.\" The state general fund debt load was $83 million in fiscal year 2010. By fiscal year 2017 the debt load sat at $179 million. In 2016, Governor Brownback earned the title of \"most unpopular governor in America\". Only 26 percent of Kansas voters approved of his job performance. 65 percent said they did not. In the summer of 2016, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded Kansas's credit rating. In February 2017, S&amp;P lowered it to AA-.\nIn February 2017, a bi-partisan group wrote a bill that would repeal the pass-through income exemption, the \"most important provisions of Brownback's overhaul\", and raise taxes to make up for the budget shortfall. Brownback vetoed the bill but \"45 GOP legislators had voted in favor of the increase, while 40 voted to uphold the governor's veto.\" On June 6, 2017 a group of Democrats and newly elected Republicans overrode Brownback's veto. They increased taxes to an amount that is close to what it was before 2013. Brownback's tax plan was described in a June 2017 article in \"The Atlantic\" as the United States' \"most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy\". The tax cuts had made schools and infrastructure difficult to get funding in Kansas.\nTransportation.\nHighways.\nThere are two interstate highways in Kansas. The first part of the interstate highway opened on Interstate 70 west of Topeka. It opened on November 14, 1956.\nInterstate 70 is an important east\u2013west highway. People can go from Kansas City, Missouri to Denver, Colorado. Cities on this highway include Colby, Hays, Salina, Junction City, Topeka, Lawrence, Bonner Springs, and Kansas City.\nInterstate 35 is a major north\u2013south highway from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Des Moines, Iowa. Cities on this highway include Wichita, El Dorado, Emporia, Ottawa, and Kansas City (and suburbs).\nAirports.\nKansas's only major commercial (Class C) airport is Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. It is along US-54 on the western part of Wichita. Manhattan Regional Airport in Manhattan has flights every day to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. This would it the second-biggest commercial airport in Kansas. Most air travelers in northeastern Kansas fly out of Kansas City International Airport, which is in Platte County, Missouri. Some also use the Topeka Regional Airport in Topeka.\nIn the state's southeastern part, people often use Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma or Joplin Regional Airport in Joplin, Missouri. People in the far western part of the state often use the Denver International Airport. Connecting flights are also available from smaller Kansas airports in Dodge City, Garden City, Hays, Hutchinson, Liberal, or Salina.\nRail.\nPassenger Rail.\nThe \"Southwest Chief\" Amtrak route goes through the state on its route from Chicago to Los Angeles. Stops in Kansas include Lawrence, Topeka, Newton, Hutchinson, Dodge City, and Garden City. An Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach connects Newton and Wichita to the Heartland Flyer in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Amtrak may change the Southwest Chief route from using train service for the entire route. Plans call for shortening the route to Los Angeles to instead end in Albuquerque. Buses would replace the train on the route between Albuquerque and Dodge City, where train service east to Chicago would continue.\nFreight Rail.\nKansas has four Class I railroads, Amtrak, BNSF, Kansas City Southern, and Union Pacific, as well as many shortline railroads.\nLaw and government.\nState and local politics.\nExecutive branch: The executive branch has the governor, the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, the secretary of state, the treasurer, and the insurance commissioner.\nLegislative branch: The legislative branch is the Kansas Legislature. It is a bicameral legislature. It has the Kansas House of Representatives and the Kansas Senate. The House has 125 members, and the Senate has 40 members.\nJudicial Branch: The judicial branch is headed by the Kansas Supreme Court. The Kansas Supreme Court has seven judges. If there is a spot open, the governor picks who to replace them.\nPolitical culture.\nSince the middle of the 20th century, Kansas has been socially conservative. In 1999 and 2005, the Board of Education voted to stop teaching evolution in schools. In 2005, Kansas banned same-sex marriage. In 2006, Kansas made the lowest age to marry 15 years old.\nKansas allowed women's suffrage in 1912. This was nearly a decade before the United States allowed it.\nNational politics.\nThe state's current delegation to the Congress of the United States includes Republican Senators Pat Roberts of Dodge City and Jerry Moran of Manhattan; and Republican Representatives Roger Marshall of Great Bend (District 1), Steve Watkins (District 2), Ron Estes of Wichita (District 4), and Democratic Representative Sharice Davids (District 3).\nKansas has been strongly Republican. The Republican Party was very strong since Kansas became a state. This is because Republicans were very anti-slavery, and Kansas was also anti-slavery. Kansas has not elected a Democrat to the United States Senate since 1932.\nAbilene has the childhood house of Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two Republican presidential candidates, Alf Landon and Bob Dole, were also from Kansas.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary schools are controlled by the Kansas State Department of Education. Public colleges and universities are controlled by the Kansas Board of Regents.\nIn 1999 and 2005, the Board of Education voted to teach intelligent design in science classes. Both times, they changed their decision after the next election.\nCulture.\nMusic.\nThe rock band Kansas was created Topeka. Many of the band's members are from there.\nJoe Walsh, guitarist for the famous rock band the Eagles, was born in Wichita.\nDanny Carey, drummer for the band Tool, was raised in Paola.\nSinger Melissa Etheridge is from Leavenworth. Singer Martina McBride is from Sharon. Singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e is from Kansas City.\nIn 1947, Kansas chose \"Home on the Range\" as their state song.\nBooks.\nKansas's most famous appearance in a book was as the home of Dorothy Gale. She is the main character in the book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (1900).\nMovies.\nThe Plaza Cinema in Ottawa, Kansas was built on May 22, 1907. It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest operating movie theater in the world.\nSports.\nCollege.\nThe group that governs college sports in the United States is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

His niece, Harriet Lane, stood in as First Lady. He was an experienced politician, and became president in 1857. His stances on slavery, and actions before the Civil War broke out, have been criticized by scholars.\nEarly life.\nJames Buchanan was born on April 23, 1791 in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania, into a prosperous merchant family. He had four sisters and three brothers, and studied at the Old Stone Academy before entering Dickinson College in 1807. There he studied law and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1812.\nBuchanan was engaged to Anne C. Coleman, but she died early, and he never had children. He is the only U.S. president who was never married.\nBuchanan served in both the House and Senate, representing Pennsylvania, as well as the Minister to Russia, under Andrew Jackson, before stepping taking the presidential career.\nPresidency.\nDuring the beginning of his presidency, he called slavery an issue of little importance. This was clearly not the case at the time; Northerners and Southerners were very divided on slavery, almost to the point of war.\nThe Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not American citizens and that the states were allowed to keep slavery legal. James Buchanan supported that decision because he did not want the pro-slavery states to stop being part of the United States.\nBuchanan supported the rights of slave owners to keep their slaves and wanted Kansas to adopt a constitution that allowed slavery. Because of that, the Democratic Party was divided on that issue and after the 1858 Congressional election, there were more Republicans in Congress than Democrats. He did not get along with the Republicans.\nHe ordered troops to fight against Utah based on untrue information that Utah was planning a revolt. Buchanan later realized that he made a mistake and apologized.\nDuring his term, the country was becoming more and more divided over the slavery issue. A few months before his term ended, some of the southern states decided that they were going to not be a part of the United States any more.\nBuchanan believed that it was a bad thing, but he did nothing about it because he felt that using force against the south was against the Constitution. He did not even prepare the country for war.\nLegacy.\nAt the end of his term, he left the next president, Abraham Lincoln, to face the greatest crises in United States history, the Civil War.\nSome historians think that Buchanan was the worst president, because he did nothing to prevent the Civil war."}

{"id": "12658", "revid": "487619", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12658", "title": "Bahrain", "text": "Bahrain (officially called Kingdom of Bahrain) is an island country in the Arabian Gulf. Saudi Arabia is to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the King Fahd Causeway, and Qatar is to the south across the Persian Gulf. The Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge, not yet built, will link Bahrain to Qatar as the longest fixed bridge in the world.Qatar and Bahrain's flag is the same design but not the same colors because Qatar is white and maroon and Bahrain is white and red.\nHistory.\nPeople have lived in Bahrain before there was writing. It has been ruled and influenced by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, and the Arabs, who made the island Muslim. Bahrain was in old times known as Dilmun, Tylos, Awal and Mishmahig.\nThe islands of Bahrain, set in the middle south of the Persian Gulf, have attracted many invaders in history. The word \"Bahrain\", \"Two Seas\", means that the islands contain two kinds of water, sweet water springs and salty water in the sea.\nA location between East and West, fertile lands, fresh water, and pearls made Bahrain important in history. About 2300 BC, Bahrain started trading with Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and the Indus Valley (now near India). It was then called Delmon, and was linked to the Sumerian Civilization about 2000 BC. Bahrain also became part of the Babylonian empire about 600 BC. Historical records called Bahrain the \"Life of Eternity\", \"Paradise\", the \"Pearl of the Persian Gulf\" and other names.\nUntil 1521, Bahrain also ruled Al-Hasa and Qatif (both are now the eastern province of Saudi Arabia) and Awal (now the Bahrain Islands). The country had all of the land from what is now Kuwait to Oman. This was called \"Iqlim Al-Bahrain\" (Province of Bahrain). In 1521, the Portuguese took Awal (now Bahrain) from the rest and since then the name of Bahrain only means today's Bahrain.\nModern history.\nThe modern history of Bahrain begins with Great Britain exploring the area, trying to keep Iran from taking more land. The British gave support to the Al-Khalifa family, who made a power base in the island and allied with the British to keep the island from Iran. The British got free passage to the Persian Gulf through this agreement. In November of 1957, the Iranian parliament declared that Bahrain was the Fourteenth Province of Iran. Later the British would become involved in the politics of Bahrain by choosing an Emir of the island. Iran and Britain later agreed that the United Nations Secretary General would judge the political situation in Bahrain. In a Plebiscite to decide the country's future, the majority of the people of Bahrain chose to reject Iran's claims, and to define their country and their culture to be Arabic, and not Persian.\nOil was found in the early 20th century and brought modern improvements to the country. Relations with the United Kingdom also became closer, and the British brought more military bases to the nation. British influence grew, until Charles Belgrave became an advisor; Belgrave brought modern education to Bahrain.\nAfter World War II, anti-British feeling spread through the Arab world and led to riots in Bahrain. The British left Bahrain in 1971, making it an independent country. The sales of more oil in the 1980s brought money to Bahrain, but even when the sales of oil decreased in later years, it did not cause as many problems in Bahrain as in other oil countries, because the economy of Bahrain had grown into other areas.\nIn 1973 the election of first parliament was done but the government stopped &amp; dissociate the parliament in 1975 which result in strong protests by the Bahraini opposition (Moderate Islamic &amp; non-Islamist opposition).\nIn 1994, many highly educated Bahraini people signed a letter to Prince of Bahrain at that time Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa\nto re-establish the parliament life which is strongly refused &amp; the leader of the opposition at that time Sheikh Abdulamir Aljamri was jailed then a huge protest &amp; conflicts occurs between Bahraini nation &amp; the armed forces.\nIn 1999, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa followed his father as head of state and called for elections for parliament to resolve the congestion that occurred over that last period. The women were given the right to vote and the new ruler released all political prisoners in 2001.\nIn 2002 the King released a new constitution without any voting from the nation &amp; canceled 1973 constitution which caused strong refuse from the most of nation parties &amp; opposition.\nThe situations became worse later &amp; some of political activists were jailed like Abdulhadi Al-Khuwajah, Hasan Mushaima.\nMany political websites that refused these changes were blocked like Bahrain online forum (the most popular website in Bahrain): www.bahrainonline.org Until 2009 there were many riots &amp; conflicts especially from Shia group which faces a huge organized discrimination according to Human Rights Watch &amp; US Congress.\nPolitics.\nBahrain is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the King, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The head of government is the Prime Minister, which is currently held by Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa was the country's first prime minister from 1971 until his death in 2020. The prime minister has a cabinet of 15 members. \nBahrain has a bicameral legislature with a lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, elected by all of the people and the upper house, the Shura Council, appointed by the King. Both houses have forty members. The first elections were held in 2002, with Members of Parliament serving four year terms.\nWomen were given the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in 2002's election, but no women were elected to office that year, and Shia and Sunni Islamists won a majority of seats. Because no women were elected, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes members of the Kingdom\u2019s Jewish and Christian people.\nThe King recently created the Supreme Judicial Council to organise the country's courts and the government offices.\nGovernorates.\nBahrain is split into five governorates. Until July 3 2003, it was divided into twelve municipalities.\nFor further information, see: Decree-Law establishing governorates from the Bahrain official website.\nCities.\nThe largest cities in Bahrain are:\nOther towns include: Awali, Diraz, Hidd, Sar, Bani Jamrah.\nEconomy.\nIn Bahrain, petroleum (oil product) producing and processing is about 60% of the money from export, 60% of government money, and 30% of Gross Domestic Product. The economy has changed as the sales of oil have changed since 1985, for example, during and after the Persian Gulf War of 1990 - 1991. Bahrain has high quality communications and transport, and so the country is home to many international companies with business in the Persian Gulf. A large part of the country's income comes from petroleum products made from imported crude oil. There are several major industrial projects being built. Unemployment, especially among young people, and the decrease of both oil and water resources are major economic problems.\nGeography.\nBahrain is a flat and dry archipelago, with a low desert plain rising gently to a low central hill, in the Arabian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia. The highest point is the 122 meter Jabal ad Dukhan (\"Mountain of Smoke\").\nBahrain has a total area of 620 km\u00b2, which is a few square kilometres larger than the Isle of Man. As an archipelago of 33 islands, Bahrain does not share a land border with any other country, but it does have a 161\u00a0km coast line and claims a further 12 nm of territorial sea and a 24\u00a0nm contiguous zone. Bahrain enjoys mild winters and has very hot, humid summers.\nBahrain's natural resources include large amounts of oil natural gas as well as fish. Only 1% of the country includes land where crops can be grown. 92% of Bahrain is desert, and droughts and dust storms are the main natural dangers.\nEnvironmental problems in Bahrain include desertification, which is causing the land where crops can be grown to decrease, and damage to coast lines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation caused by oil spills from large tankers and oil refineries.\nAbout the people.\nThe official religion of Bahrain is Islam; most of the people are Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, but there are also small Jewish and Christian minorities. Most Bahrainis are Arabs, although some tribes came from Persia. Today, many of the people in Bahrain are guest workers who come from Iran, South Asia and Southeast Asia. A \"Financial Times\" article from 31 May 1983 found that \"Bahrain is a polyglot (speaking many languages) state, both religiously and racially. Leaving aside the temporary immigrants of the past 10 years, there are at least eight or nine communities (groups of people) on the island\".\nThe present communities may be classified as Al-Khalifa, Arab tribes allied to Al-Khalifa, the Baharnah (Shia Arabs), the Howilla (Sunni Arabs from Persia), Sunni Arabs (from the mainland), Ajam (Persian Shia), Indians who traded with Bahrain and settled before the age of oil (used to be called Banyan), a tiny Jewish community, and a group which contains everyone else.\nCulture.\nManama, Bahrain's capital city, is as modern as other cities in the world. But life in the island's many villages (and in parts of Manama itself) remains traditional. Where there is tradition in the Persian Gulf area, there is Islamic conservatism: women cover themselves from head to foot and women travellers are expected to wear long skirts and one-piece bathing suits. Bahrain's population is 85% Muslim and Islam is the state religion. Arabic is the official language, but many people speak English.\nTraditional folk art continues in several places around Bahrain: dhows (fishing boats) are built near Manama and Muharraq, cloth is made at Bani Jamrah and pottery is made at A'ali. A few goldsmiths still work in the Manama souk, though much of the work is now done in other countries. One of the important parts of Bahraini culture is the drinking of traditional Arabian coffee. Traditional Arabian street food like shawarma (lamb or chicken cut from a large spit and served in pita bread) and desserts such as baklava are also found.\nFormula One.\nBahrain is the home of Formula One racing in the Middle East, hosting the Bahrain Grand Prix."}

It is one of the oldest parts of the study of Physics, and is studied by physicists, mathematicians, and engineers. Mathematics can describe how fluids move using mathematical formulas called equations. The fluid dynamics of gases are called aerodynamics.\nUnderstanding how fluids behave helps us understand things like flight or ocean currents. For example, fluid dynamics can be used to understand weather, because clouds and air are both fluids. Fluid dynamics can also be used to understand how aeroplanes fly through the air or how ships and submarines move through water.\nComputer programs can use the mathematical equations of fluid dynamics to model and predict the actions of moving fluids. Computers have helped us understand fluid dynamics very much, and some people study how to model or simulate fluids only with a computer. Studying how fluid dynamics can be done with computers is called computational fluid dynamics (or CFD for short).\nImportant equations in fluid dynamics.\nThe mathematical equations that govern fluid flow are simple to think about but very hard to solve. In most real life cases there is no way to get a solution that can be written down and a computer must be used to calculate the answer instead. There are three fundamental equations based on three rules.\nConservation of mass: mass is neither created nor destroyed, it simply moves from one place to another. This gives the mass conservation equation. Sometimes this may not apply such as a flow involving a chemical reaction.\nConservation of energy: this is the first law of thermodynamics, energy is never created or destroyed, it just changes form (i.e. kinetic energy into potential energy) or moves around.\nConservation of momentum: this is Newton's Second Law and it states that Force = rate of change of momentum. Momentum is mass times velocity. The momentum equations are the equations that make it hard to solve problems in fluid dynamics. There are a number of different versions that include a number of different effects. The Navier-Stokes equations are momentum equations, and the Euler equations are the Navier-Stokes equations but with viscosity not included. There is one momentum equation in a 1D problem and three, one in each space direction, in 3D.\nTo solve the equations more information is often needed in the form of an equation of state. This relates thermodynamic properties (usually pressure and temperature) to each other for a specific type of fluid. An example is the \"Ideal Gas\" equation of state that relates pressure, temperature and density and works well for gases under normal pressures (like air at atmospheric pressure)."}
{"id": "12682", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12682", "title": "Ernest Hemingway", "text": "Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 - July 2, 1961) was an American writer. He is generally thought to be a member of the Lost Generation. Some people say that, of the many characters he created in his books, the author himself was his best creation.\nHemingway's early life.\nVery early days.\nErnest Hemingway was born in 1899. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, near the midwestern city of Chicago. He was the second child in a family of six. His father was a doctor. His mother was a painter and a pianist.\nEach summer, the family travelled to their holiday home in northern Michigan. Ernest's father taught him how to catch fish, hunt, set up a camp, and cook over a fire.\nAt home in Oak Park, Ernest wrote for his school newspaper. He tried to write like a famous sports writer, Ring Lardner, and he made his writing skills better.\nStart as a news reporter.\nIn 1917, Hemingway decided not to go to a university. The United States had just entered World War I and he wanted to join the Army, but they rejected him because his eyesight was not good enough.\nErnest found a job with the \"Kansas City Star\" newspaper in Kansas City, Missouri. He reported news that happened at the hospital, police headquarters, and the railroad station. One reporter said: \"Hemingway liked to be where the action was.\"\nThe Kansas City Star told its reporters to write short sentences, and to report unusual details of an incident. Hemingway quickly learned to do both.\nHis life outside of America.\nHemingway worked for the newspaper for nine months. He then joined the Red Cross to help on the battle fields of Europe. His job was to drive an ambulance and to take wounded soldiers off the battlefield.\nThe Red Cross sent him to Italy. There, he soon saw the first wounded. This was when a weapons factory in Milan exploded. Later, he was sent to the battle front. He went close to the fighting to see how he could act in the face of danger. Soon, he was seriously wounded.\nSoon after healing, the war ended. Hemingway returned to the United States. After less than a year he had changed forever: he needed to write about what he had seen. Hemingway wrote many short stories about people who experienced World War I.\nGone to Chicago.\nSome time later, Hemingway left home for Chicago to prove to himself, and to his family, that he could earn a living from his writing.\nBut he ran out of money and began to write for a newspaper again. The Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Star, loved his reports in Chicago. They hired him and paid him well.\nIn Chicago, Hemingway also met Sherwood Anderson. Anderson was one of the first American writers to write about common people. Hemingway saw that Anderson's stories showed life as it really was. This was similar to what he wanted to do.\nAnderson gave Hemingway advice about his writing. He told Hemingway to move to Paris. Life was less costly there. Anderson said that Paris had many young artists and writers from many nations.\nIn Paris.\nHemingway decided to move to Paris. Before he did, in America, he married a woman he had recently met. Her name was Hadley Richardson.\nParis was cold and grey when Hemingway and his new wife arrived in 1921. They lived in one of the poorer parts of the city. Their rooms were small and they did not have water from pipes. But the \"Toronto Star\" employed him as its European reporter, so they had enough money for the two of them to live. That job gave Hemingway time to write his stories.\nHemingway enjoyed exploring Paris, learning French customs, and meeting friends. Some of these new friends were artists and writers who had come to the city in the 1920s. Among them were poet, Ezra Pound, and writers Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Seeing that Hemingway was a good writer, they helped him publish his stories in the United States. He was thankful for their support at the time, but later denied that he had received their help.\nHemingway travelled all over Europe. He wrote about politics, peace conferences, and border disputes, as well as sports, skiing, and fishing. Later he would write about bullfighting in Spain. The \"Toronto Star\" was pleased with his work, and wanted more of his reports, but Hemingway was busy with his own writing.\nHe said this: \"Sometimes, I would start a new story and could not get it going. Then I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think. I would say to myself: 'All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know.' So finally, I would write a true sentence and go on from there. It was a wonderful feeling when I had worked well.\"\nHis first success in 1925.\nHemingway's first book of short stories was called \"In Our Time\". One of its stories, \"Big Two Hearted River,\" told of the effects of war on a young man who was taking a long fishing trip in Michigan. Hemingway had learned from his father, when he was a boy, about living in the wild.\nThe story is about two kinds of rivers. One is calm and clear, and is where the young man fishes. The other is a dark, threatening swamp. The story shows its main character trying to forget his past, as well as the war. He does not talk much about the war. The reader learns about the young man, not because Hemingway tells his readers what the man thinks, but because he shows that man learning about himself. Many people believe it is one of the best modern American stories of all time. Because of this, \"Big Two Hearted River\" is often published in collections of best writing.\nAfter the book was published in 1925, Hadley and Hemingway returned to the United States for the birth of their son, after which they quickly returned to Paris.\nA book: The Sun Also Rises.\nHemingway was working on a long story. He wanted to publish a novel so he would be recognized as a serious writer. And he wanted the money a novel would earn.\nThe novel was called \"The Sun Also Rises\". It is about young Americans in Europe after World War One. The war had destroyed their dreams and had given them nothing to replace those dreams. The writer Gertrude Stein later called these people members of \"The Lost Generation.\"\nThe book was an immediate success. At the age of 25 Ernest Hemingway was famous. Many people, however, did not like Hemingway's art because they did not like what he wrote about.\nHemingway's sentences were short, the way he had been taught to write at the Kansas City Star newspaper. He wrote about what he knew and felt. He used few descriptive words. His statements were clear and easily understood.\nHe had learned from earlier writers, like Ring Lardner and Sherwood Anderson, but Hemingway brought something new to his writing. He was able to paint in words what he saw and felt. In later books, sometimes he missed. Sometimes he even looked foolish. But when he was right he was almost perfect.\nMarriage with Pauline Pfeiffer.\nWith the success of his novel, Hemingway became even more popular in Paris. Many people came to see him. One was an American woman, Pauline Pfeiffer. She became Hadley's friend. Then Pauline fell in love with Hemingway.\nHemingway and Pauline saw each other secretly. One time, they went away together on a short trip. Years later, Hemingway wrote about returning home after that trip:\n\"When I saw Hadley again, I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her. She was smiling and the sun was on her lovely face. \"\nBut the marriage was over. Ernest Hemingway and Hadley separated. She kept their son. He agreed to give her money he earned from his books.\nIn later years, he looked back at his marriage to Hadley as the happiest time of his life.\nAt twenty-five, Hemingway was living in Paris. He was a famous writer. But the end of his first marriage made him want to leave the place where he had first become famous.\nMuch later he said, \"the city was never to be the same again. When I returned to it, I found it had changed as I had changed. Paris was never the same as when I was poor and very happy.\"\nHemingway and his new wife returned to the United States in 1928. They settled in Key West, an island with a fishing port near the southern coast of Florida.\nHis well-known books.\nBefore leaving Paris, Hemingway sent a collection of his stories to New York to be published. The book of stories, called \"Men Without Women\", was published soon after Hemingway arrived in Key West.\nThe Killers.\nOne of the stories was called \"The Killers.\" In it, Hemingway used a discussion between two men to create a feeling of tension and coming violence. This was a new method of telling a story:\nNick opened the thingy and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He did not look at Nick.\n\"What was it?\" He asked.\n\"I was up at Henry's,\" Nick said, \"and two fellows came in and tied me up and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you.\"\nIt sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing, \"they put us out in the kitchen,\" Nick went on. \"They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper.\"\nOle Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything. \"George thought I ought to come and tell you about it.\"\n\"There is not anything I can do about it,\" Ole Andreson said.\nAny new book by Hemingway was an important event for readers. But stories like \"The Killers\" shocked many people. Some thought there was too much violence in his stories. Others said he only wrote about gunmen, soldiers, fighters, and drinkers.\nThis made Hemingway angry. He felt that writers should not be judged by those who could not write a story.\nHemingway was happy in Key West. In the morning he wrote, in the afternoon he fished, and at night he went to a public house and drank. One old fisherman said: \"Hemingway was a man who talked slowly and very carefully. He asked a lot of questions. And he always wanted to get his information exactly right.\"\nHemingway and his wife Pauline had a child in Key West..\nSoon afterwards, he heard that his father had killed himself. Hemingway was shocked. He said, \"My father taught me so much. He was the only one I really cared about.\"\nWhen Hemingway returned to work there was a sadness about his writing that was not there before.\nHis new book told about an American soldier who served with the Italian army during World War One. He meets an English nurse, and they fall in love. They flee from the army, but she dies during childbirth. Some of the events are taken from Hemingway's service in Italy. The book is called \"A Farewell to Arms\".\nPart of the book talks about the defeat of the Italian army at a place called Caporetto:\n\"At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass overhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad. . . .\n\"Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on a road leading up to a bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it. We went up the bank looking for a place to cross. . . . we did not see any troops; only abandoned trucks and stores. Along the river bank was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground. \"\nDeath in the Afternoon.\n\"A Farewell to Arms\" was very successful. It earned Hemingway a great deal of money. It permitted him to travel.\nOne place he visited was Spain, a country he loved. He said, \"I want to paint with words all the sights and sounds and smells of Spain. And if I can write any of it down truly, then it will represent all of Spain.\"\nHe wrote a book called \"Death in the Afternoon\". It describes the Spanish custom of bull fighting. Hemingway believed that bull fighting was an art, just as much as writing was an art. And he believed it was a true test of a man's bravery, something that always concerned him.\nThe Snows of Kilimanjaro.\nHemingway also travelled to Africa. He had been asked to write a series of reports about African hunting. He said, \"Hunting in Africa is the kind of hunting I like. No riding in cars, just simple walking and feeling the grass under my feet.\"\nThe trip to Africa resulted in a book called \"The Green Hills of Africa\" and many smaller stories.\nOne story is one of Hemingway's best. The story, called \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\", tells of Hemingway's fears about himself. It is about a writer who betrays his art for money and is unable to remain true to himself.\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\nIn 1936, the Civil War in Spain gave him a chance to return to Spain and test his bravery again. He agreed to write about the war for an American news organization.\nIt was a dangerous job. One day, Hemingway and two other reporters were driving a car near a battlefield. The car carried two white flags to show they were not fighting. But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy officers. Hemingway was almost killed. Later he said that \"bullets are all the same. If they do not hit you, there is no story. If they do hit you, then you do not have to write it. \"\nThe trip to Spain resulted in two works: a play called \"The Fifth Column\", and a novel called \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\". The novel tells the story of an American who has chosen to fight against the fascists. He realizes that there are lies and injustice on his side. But he sees no hope except the victory of his side. During the fighting, he escapes his fear of death and of being alone. He decides that \"he can live as full a life in seventy hours as in seventy years.\"\nLater days and his married life.\nThe book was a great success. Hemingway enjoyed being famous. His second marriage was ending. He divorced Pauline and married reporter Martha Gellhorn. He had met her while they were working in Spain. They decided to live in Cuba, near the city of Havana. Their house looked out over the Caribbean Sea.\nBut this marriage did not last long. Hemingway was changing. He began to feel that whatever he said was right. Martha went on long trips to be away from him. He drank heavily to forget his loneliness.\nWhen America entered World War Two, Hemingway went to Britain as a reporter. Later he took part in the invasion of Europe and the freeing of Paris.\nDuring the war, Hemingway met another reporter, Mary Walsh. In 1945, when his marriage to Martha was legally over, he married Mary.\nAfter the war, Hemingway began work on his last important book, \"The Old Man and the Sea\". It is the story of a Cuban fisherman who refuses to be defeated by nature.\nHemingway said, \"I was trying to show the experience of the fisherman so exactly and directly that it became part of the reader's experience.\"\nIn 1954, Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature. But he was too sick to take part in the ceremony.\nErnest Hemingway was 60 years old, but he said he felt like he was 86. Even worse, he felt that he no longer was able to write. He seemed to be living the story about the writer who had sold his writing skill in order to make money.\nIn 1961, Ernest Hemingway shot himself dead. Among the papers he left was one that described what he liked best:\n\"To stay in places and to leave. . . to trust, to distrust. . . to no longer believe and believe again. . . to watch the changes in the seasons. . . to be out in boats. . . to watch the snow come, to watch it go. . . to hear the rain. . . And to know where I can find what I want.\"\nErnest Hemingway owned many cats, especially cats with extra toes. Today these cats are sometimes called \"Hemingway cats\" in his honor. His house in Key West, Florida is now a home for his cats and their kittens.\nThe article above is a rewriting of public domain material, provided by Voice of America Special English"}

{"id": "12702", "revid": "1061092", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12702", "title": "Muhammad", "text": "Muhammad (; ; \u2013 8 June 632) was the founder of Islam. Muslims and Baha'is believe he was a messenger and a prophet of Allah (God). He is believed to be a descendant of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, and the last of all prophets (\"the seal of the prophets\"). He is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow.\nThe foregoing history of Islam has been formed by works based on collections of narration culture. These narrations are not supported by non-Islamic sources and contain contradictions within themselves. Muslims believe that (the narrative culture) Qur'an was first revealed to Muhammad by the archangel Gabriel in a cave on the mountain of Hira in Mecca, and then over a period of twenty-three years until his death.\nReliability of Information Sources.\nThe first studies on Muhammad's life, consist of compilations of oral narrations written in A.D. 8th and 9th centuries (150-200 years after the life of Muhammad). These works, called Siyer and Megazi, contains the life story and words of Muhammad, (which is famous among Muslims) and allegedly told by Muhammad himself. Many additions continued to these stories and words in the following centuries in Shiite and Sunni societies. Prof. Dr. Mehmet \u00d6zdemir In his article on \"Siyer writing\", draws attention to the examples of Ibn Ishaq-Ibni Hisham, and the \"increasing number of narrations\" describes Muhammad as extraordinary and \"miracle\". As an example, \u00d6zdemir tells about the birth myth of Muhammad, which was not included in the first written sirah books (or very little), but took a large place in the sirah books over time, and the narrations of extraordinary events belonging to childhood and adolescence. (\u0130rhasat in islamic literature)\nIf \"the works based on the narrative culture\" are excluded, the early history of Islam (when it emerged, in which geography it was born and spread to the world) remains unclear today in terms of historiography. In the discussions, Kufa and Al-Hirah regions (Southern Iraq) stand out besides Petra. \nHistory based on narratives.\nChildhood.\nMuhammad was born about 570\u00a0AD in Mecca. His father, whose name was Abdullah, died six months before Muhammad's birth. His mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. So, his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, took care of him after the death of Amina but he too died two years later when Muhammad was nine. After his grandfather's death, his uncle Abu Talib took care of him, and was a support to him for many years of his adult life.\nBeginning of the prophethood.\nIn 610\u00a0AD, when Muhammad was forty years old, he went for a walk to the mountain of Hira near Mecca. According to Muslims, the angel Jibrail (Gabriel) spoke with him in a cave on the mountain. The story says that when Muhammad first saw the angel Gabriel, he fainted, because Gabriel was so large. This is what Jibrail said to Muhammad:\n\"Read... in the name of God Who made man from a drop of blood... God is Most Rewarding... He Who taught man to write with pen... and taught man what he knew not.\"\nMuhammad went back home to his wife Khadijah, and told her what had happened. New revelations came to him commanding him to preach what was being sent \"down\" from God. When Muhammad first started teaching, many of the people of Mecca, who worshipped idols, did not like the things that Muhammad said. But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages. These people were the first of the followers of Islam. Leaders of Mecca punished and tortured the followers of Islam. Some followers of Islam were executed. Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam.\nThe Hijrah.\nAfter Muhammad finished in Mecca, he took his message to Medina, where some people learned about him and his followers. They welcomed him into their city, and Muhammad wanted them to convert to Islam. They agreed, and many of his followers went to Medina. This movement from Mecca to Medina is called the \"Hijrah\". The Hijra was also the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Mecca safely.\nAs Muhammad stayed in Mecca, his uncle Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep. According to the history, they did not see him leave Mecca. The men went into his house and found his cousin, Ali. Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend, Abu Bakr.\nHis stay in Medina.\nMuhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina. Some people welcomed Muhammad to their homes. He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house. Also, the first mosque of Medina, a small place for prayer, was built in the back of this house.\nThe people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with the teachings and rules set by Muhammad. This tribe told their allies in Mecca to sell of all the things and homes that Muslims of Mecca left behind. The Muslims and those from Mecca were advised to fight for their property. Muhammad told them not to do that.\nMuslims were called all over Medina to gather at a mosque that Muhammad prayed in. They were told to fight against the people of Mecca who burned down their homes and stole their property.\nThe wars.\nThe Quraysh pagans of Mecca heard about this, and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims. They met in Badr, but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl, one of the pagan leaders, was also killed.\nBut, the Muslims lost the second battle at Uhud. One year after the fight at Badr, the army of Mecca had outside help. Muslim archers failed to listen to Muhammad's instructions and Khalid ibn al-Walid cleverly took advantage of that. Hamza, Muhammad's last uncle, was killed when a slave from Mecca threw a spear into his chest. Muhammad himself was injured.\nThen in 627, Abu Sufyan led the Quraysh and its allies to attack Medina itself. However, they could not pass the trench that the Muslims had dug around Medina. After several weeks, the coalition broke up and went home. The Medinians were considered victors.\nThe truce with Mecca.\nAfter the pagans of Mecca failed to gain control of Medina, the Muslims became stronger. The pagans then decided to sign a truce with the Muslims. This means that they would not fight each other for ten years. The Muslims used this as a chance to talk to other people all over Arabia. In three years, many people changed their religions to Islam.\nBut, this truce did not last for long. After three years of it, a small group of horsemen from Mecca attacked a Muslim camp and killed a few of them. The Muslims in Medina heard of this, and the truce was cancelled. Abu Sufyan, third leader of Mecca in Muhammad's lifetime, tried to resume the truce, but Muhammad politely refused the offer. Muhammad told his followers to be ready to capture Mecca. After Mecca was captured, they went on to capture the Torkan.\nThe capture of Mecca.\nIn 630, most people in Arabia had become Muslims, and they became part of Muhammad's large army to capture Mecca. Because of the big size of the army, the people of Mecca were afraid to fight back. Abu Sufyan, who was feeling unhappy over the broken truce, went to Muhammad's camp outside Mecca to ask for forgiveness. Muhammad did not say that he would forgive him, so he returned home. While he was with Muhammad, he changed his religion to Islam by saying the Testimony (ash-Ashaada):\n\"I testify that there is no other god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\"\nThe next day, the Muslim army walked towards Mecca. Everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Ka'aba, believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal ibn Ribah, a former Ethiopian slave, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: \"All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe.\"\nAbu Sufyan heard this in his home. From this, he learns that Muhammad forgave him. At that time, Muhammad and his followers removed and broke all idols from the Kaaba. The idols were statues that were worshiped as gods. Muhammad forgave all citizens of Mecca. At the end, Bilal climbed to the top of the Kaaba and called for prayer. This was Muhammad's victory in spreading Islam all over Arabia. But, because he was old, he would not live for long.\nHis death.\nIn 632\u00a0AD, on June 8, Muhammad became very sick, due to poisoning by a Jewess. Before he died, he told his followers about his death. He is buried in the chamber of his wife Aisha in Medina, where the Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) is. In Medina, his friend Abu Bakr went to the Masjid al-Nabawi and shouted to the people:\n\"If any of you worship Muhammad, you should know that Muhammad is dead. But those of you who worship Allah(swt) (God), let it be known that Allah(swt) (God) is alive and cannot die.\"\nAlthough Muhammad died, Islam soon spread all over the Middle East. Then, centuries later, it continued till it reached Africa, Asia and Europe. Islam has become one of the world's biggest and fastest growing religions.\nRelations.\nWhen Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with \"Peace and Blessings be upon him\" (Arabic: \"sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam\"). For example, \"Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him)\". In printed matter, a calligraphic symbol is frequently used instead of printing the phrase. Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr succeeded Muhammad. Shias believe that Ali should have succeeded.\nImages of Muhammad.\nMost Muslims do not make or show images of Muhammad. The Qur'an does not state that images of Muhammad must not ever be made, but it does contain passages that forbid the creation of idols. There are also passages against the creation of images of God in the Hadith. Muslims, especially Sunni Muslims, believe there should be no pictures of Muhammad. When people create images of Muhammad, some Muslims may view this as disrespectful, offensive and emotionally injurious.\nIn 2005, a Danish newspaper published political cartoons of Muhammad. More than 100 people died during ensuing demonstrations. Johan Galtung, a Norwegian mathematician and peace activist, tried to help both sides come together and talk about this. According to Galtung, the attacks against Danish institutions ended after the government had invited talks.\nOn 7th January, 2015 the Kouachi brothers, hooded and armed with Kalashnikovs, burst into the editorial meeting of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, shooting at the assembled people. They killed cartoonists Cabu, Charb, Honor\u00e9, Tignous and Wolinski, psychoanalyst Elsa Cayat, economist Bernard Maris, proof-reader Mustapha Ourrad, police officer Frank Brinsolaro who was protecting Charb, Michel Renaud, founder of the Rendez-vous du Carnet de voyage festival invited to the meeting, and caretaker Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boisseau. They also seriously wounded cartoonist Riss, journalists Philippe Lan\u00e7on and Fabrice Nicolino and webmaster Simon Fieschi.\nAs they left the building, just before killing policeman Ahmed Merabet who was lying on the pavement wounded and begging for mercy, the terrorists shouted: \u201cWe\u2019ve avenged the prophet Muhammad\u201d.\nIn addition the following murders have been officially linked to the Charlie Hebdo massacre: Clarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, a policewoman was killed in the suburb of Montrouge. As were four people taken hostage at a supermarket in the east of Paris. These were Yohan Cohen, 20, worked at the supermarket, Philippe Braham, 45, a business manager for an IT firm, Yoav Hattab, 21, a student and the youngest supermarket victim, Francois-Michel Saada, 64, was a former pension fund manager.\nAmedy Coulibaly, 32, the hostage-taker in the supermarket, has also been linked by Paris prosecutors to the shooting and wounding of a 32-year-old jogger in a park in south-west Paris, on the day of the Charlie Hebdo attack.\nWives.\nA list of his wives' names in chronological order\nKhadijah bint Khuwaylid.\nAbdullah ibn Jafar reported that he heard Sayyiduna Ali saying in Kufa that Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \"The best of the women of her time was Maryam, daughter of Imran, and the best of women of her time was Khadijah, daughter of Khuwaylid.\" She was 40 years old when they got married.\nSawda bint Zam\u02bfa.\nSawda bint Zam'a was the first woman to immigrate to Abyssinia in the way of Allah.\nAisha.\nAisha was a young girl. She is described as very intelligent with a very good memory. Aisha spent the next nine years of her life with Muhammad, she remembered all that she saw and heard with great clarity, and reported a great deal of Muhammad's narrations. She married Muhammad when she was six years old.\nHafsa bint Umar.\nBy marrying Hafsa, Muhammad strengthened the ties between two of his closest Companions, the two who would become the first two rightly guided khalifs after his death. He was now married to the daughter of Abu Bakr, A'isha and to the daughter of Umar, Hafsa.\nZaynab bint Khuzayma.\nShe offered herself in marriage to Muhammad who accepted her proposal and married her. Zaynab bint Khuzayma was seen by the community as very generous to orphans and the poor, later becoming known as the 'Mother of the Poor'. She died only eight months after.\nUmm Salama.\nShe was not the only wife to have been widowed as a result of the battle of Uhud, and because of this marriage, many of the Companions followed Muhammad's example, marrying widows and bringing them and their children into the circle of their families, instead of leaving them to struggle on their own.\nZaynab bint Jahsh.\nAs with all the marriages of Muhammad, there was much for all the Muslims to learn from it. This one was to show that Zayed ibn Haretha was not Muhammad's son and to demonstrate that the social level matters when it comes to marriage. She bragged about the fact that her marriage had been arranged by Allah. It was at this point that Muhammad changed her name from Barra to Zaynab.\nJuwayriyya bint al-Harith.\nMuhammad was thinking of how to save her and all her tribe from danger. By marrying Juwayriyya, the Banu Mustaliq would be able to enter Islam with honor, and with the humiliation of their recent defeat removed, so that it would no longer be felt necessary by them to embark on a war of vengeance that would have continued until one of the two parties had been annihilated. \nRamla bint Abi Sufyan.\nShe said that once Muhammad said to her, \"A house will be built in Heaven for anyone who, in the space of a day and a night, prays twelve voluntary prayers;\" and she added, \"I have never stopped doing this since\"\nSafiyya bint Huyayy.\nThe only person who could save her from becoming a slave after having enjoyed such a high position was Muhammad. Although her father had planned to assassinate Muhammad after the battle of Uhud, and had conspired with the Banu Qurayza to exterminate all the Muslims during the battle of al-Khandaq. Muslims believe that this was characteristic of Muhammad, as he is believed to not have any grudges.\nMaymunah bint al-Harith.\nMuhammad gave her the name, Maymuna, meaning \"blessed\", and Maymuna lived with Muhammad for just over three years, until his death. She was said to be very good natured and is said to have got on well with everyone and no quarrel or disagreement with any of Muhammad's other wives has been related to her. Aisha said, \"Among us, she had the most fear of Allah and did the most to maintain ties of kinship.\"\nMaria al-Qibtiyya.\nMaria is said to have been honored and respected by Muhammad and his family and Companions. She spent three years of her life with Muhammad, until his death, and died five years later. For the last five years of her life, she remained a recluse and almost never went out except to visit the grave of Muhammad or her son's grave. After her death, Umar ibn al Khattab led the prayer over her and she was buried in al Baqi.\nReferences.\nNotes"}

The first cars were built in Ford's Dearborn, Michigan factory on March 9 of that year and the car was first shown to the public on April 17 at the New York World's Fair. It did not cost a lot of money, but it was still very fancy and looked like a much more expensive car. People could order their Mustang with many options and body styles, such as a convertible, 2+2 (fastback), or coupe. Many different engines were available, from the 170 CID six-cylinder to some of Ford's biggest and most powerful V-8 engines in later years. This meant car buyers could have a Mustang that saved gas or a more powerful and fast car. More than one million Mustangs were sold in only two years. The Mustang is still being sold today and is still very popular. It was so popular and so different when it was introduced that the Mustang and other cars from other makers which looked like the Mustang were given the name \"ponycar.\"\nThe so-called \"1964 1/2\" Mustang was designed by Joe Oros and Dave Ash of Ford's Mercury division, was based on another Ford car, the Falcon and was proposed by Ford's president, Lee Iacocca. The Falcon was not expensive to build and that helped Iacocca get the Mustang the approval it needed to be built. The people who ran the Ford company did not want to take a chance on a car like that because they lost a lot of money on another car, the Edsel, just a few years back. It set sales records and became one of the best selling cars of all time. It would remain mostly the same until 1966. So popular was the Mustang that three Ford assembly plants worked to build it. Not only was the Mustang built in Dearborn, but in Metuchen, New Jersey and San Jose, California as well.\nThe very first Mustang built to be sold to the public was a white convertible with a black interior and a V-8 engine. It was purchased by a pilot from Newfoundland. Ford offered the one millionth Mustang to the owner in exchange for the first one. That first Mustang, serial number 5F08F100001, is still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn.\nIts second bodystyle came out in 1967, its third in 1969 and its fourth in 1971. Bigger, more powerful engines were offered starting in 1967, making some Mustangs into musclecars. Some of those special Mustangs had special names such as Mustang GT, Mach 1, Boss 302, Boss 351, Boss 429 and 429 SCJ, or \"Super Cobra Jet.\" By 1971, the Mustang had become a much larger car. The car grew in size so that Ford could put its biggest engines in it, but insurance companies were charging very high prices to insure powerful cars and sales began to drop. Many people missed the original, smaller Mustang.\nA new second generation Mustang came out in 1974 called Mustang II and was based on the Ford Pinto, although far less than the original car had been based on the Falcon. This new car was almost the same size as the original car, but emissions controls and the Arab oil embargo meant that the Mustang II was not a very powerful car. 1974 was not only the first time Ford had built a car which looked like an older model, it was also the first American car to be built on the metric system. The short, low hood meant that neither the inline six-cylinder engine nor V-8 would fit, so engine choices were changed to a 2.3\u00a0liter four-cylinder engine built by Ford in Brazil and a more expensive V-6 engine built by Ford in Germany. A 5.0\u00a0liter V-8 engine was offered in 1975 which meant that Ford engineers had to redesign much of the car to make it fit. No matter which engine was used, the Mustang II was a heavier car than the 1964-66 model.\nThe Mustang II helped keep the ponycar alive between 1974 and 1978. General Motors almost stopped building their popular Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird; Chrysler Corporation stopped building the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Barracuda during that time. General Motors stopped building the Camaro in 2002, but they brought back a new version in 2009. Chrysler brought back a new Challenger in 2008 as well; they, like today's Mustang, are made to look like older models.\nThe new third generation Mustang that came out in 1979 may have been the most important Mustang ever. One reason was the return of a powerful V-8 in 1982 which was developed in later years into an even more powerful engine. The basic design continued all the way through the 1993 model year, with a fourth generation launching for the 1994 model year but still using the platform of the old car, but with hundreds of thousands of improvements over the years, very few parts except for some minor chassis parts stayed unchanged.\nThe 2005 model was the first all-new Mustang since 1979. Because the original Mustang was and is one of the most popular cars ever, Ford made the new Mustang coupe and convertible look very much like the first Mustangs, especially the 1967 and 1968 models. The engines of the 2005 Mustang were based on the older engines, but had more power. The 4.0-liter V6 engine made 210\u00a0hp and the 4.6-liter V8 300\u00a0hp, which rose to 315\u00a0hp on the 2008 Bullitt. All models were available with manual and automatic transmissions.\nBoth Ford and Carroll Shelby recently brought back the a new version of the very fast Shelby GT-500 Mustang in 2007. Mr. Shelby helped create the special Shelby GT-350 and GT-500 versions of the Mustang beginning in 1965. The 2007 Shelby GT500 had a 5.4-liter V8, which produced 500\u00a0hp. In 2008 a KR version with 540\u00a0hp was added.\nThe 2010 Mustang in turn looks much like the 2005-09 model, but all the body parts except for the roof are different. The rear turn signals of the 2005-2010 cars blink in a one-two-three sequence like the 1967-68 Mercury Cougar and 1964-66 Ford Thunderbird. Power for the V8 rose to 315\u00a0hp. In 2011, the Mustang received new engines, a 3.7-liter V6 base engine with 305\u00a0hp and a new 5.0-liter engine with 412\u00a0hp. Power on the Shelby GT500 rose to 550\u00a0hp and later to 662\u00a0hp in 2013. A Boss 302 performance version powered by a 444\u00a0hp V8 was introduced for 2012.\nFor 2015, a completely new Ford Mustang was introduced. This included a 5.0 V8 engine which produced 435hp, and was really a stylish and morden look. \nThat was the Ford Mustang in 2015 but in 2016, Shelby decided to boost the 6th generation Mustang by creating the all new Shelby GT350R which had a 5.2 litre V8 with 526hp at 7500RPM. This was a great increase in performance since the 2015 Mustang. It also included many carbon fibre pieces that were put into the car to reduce its weight. The stock rims in fact were the first ever carbon fibre rims created by NASA, a space station in the USA. The GT350R also had a mounted carbon fibre spoiler and quad exhaust pipes. The same Mustang will be sold in America until 2018, where Ford is rumoured to give us a brand new facelifted Mustang...\nBeginning with the 2021 model year, Ford also uses the Mustang name on a new, large electric crossover model called the Mach-E. \nThe 2021 Mustang Mach-E is Ford's first all-electric crossover, and it was designed and named after the company's iconic pony car. The Mach-E also pays homage to the \"Mach 1\" moniker that has been used on high-performance Mustangs of old. Ford said it went with the name because it needed the electrified crossover to be as desirable as a Tesla to usher in its new era of electric vehicles. It's expected to provide 300 miles of driving range when paired with the extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive. "}

The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called .\nSushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it using chopsticks. Gari (Japanese pickled ginger slices) must be eaten with chopsticks.\nThere are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is : fish meat that is placed on top of a small portion of \"sumeshi\". Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the \"sumeshi\", such as roe (fish eggs), and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, , consists of \"sumeshi\" rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the US, \"makizushi\" is more popular than \"nigirizushi\". Another type is known as or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the \"nori\" wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of \"sumeshi\", fish, and vegetables.\nSushi is eaten with your bare hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. \"Gari\" (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser.\nIn Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in \"conveyor-belt shops\" called \"kaiten zushi\" (\u56de\u8ee2\u5bff\u53f8), where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well.\nHistory.\nSushi began when rice farming came to Japan over 2,000 years ago. The original type of sushi was developed in the Nara Prefecture as a way of preserving fish in fermented rice. During the Muromachi period, people would eat the rice \"and\" the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar, not fermented rice, was used. In more recent times, it has become a fast food associated with Japanese culture.\nThe origin of sushi goes back to Southeast Asia around the 4th century B.C.. At that time, it was called \"narezushi\". The fish was originally eaten alone, without rice. Later on, a style of namaranarezushi reached Japan. Namaranerezushi combined the fish with rice.\nWhat is called sushi in modern times was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799\u20131858) at the End of the Edo period. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented. It was prepared quickly. It could be eaten with one's hands. This fish was originally known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in Edo-Bay or Tokyo Bay. The fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay.\nBy the early 1900s, sushi was being served in the United States, after many Japanese people immigrated there. The first United States sushi shop opened up in 1906 in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. \nIn the United Kingdom, a report of sushi being eaten in Britain happened when then Crown Prince Akihito (born 1933) visited Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\nAustralia is a major source of rice used with sushi.\nManners.\nSushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it with chopsticks. However, when eating \"Gari\", you must use chopsticks.\nWhen you want to put some soy sauce on your sushi, try not to put it on the rice, because the grains will start to fall, and make a mess. \nTry to fit the entire sushi into your mouth when eating. Taking a bite and putting it back on the plate is impolite.\nHealth risks.\nAs with most foods, eating sushi has some health risks. However, most can be minimized with proper preparation. Some large fish, such as tuna (especially bluefin), can contain high levels of mercury. Tuna can cause mercury poisoning when consumed in very large quantities over time. Parasite infection by raw fish is not common in the modern world (less than 40 cases per year in the US). Infections can generally be avoided by boiling, burning, preserving in salt or vinegar, or freezing to a certain temperature. Although \"nigirizushi\" will almost always appear in a raw form, often much of the fish has been previously frozen to specific temperatures to prevent parasites.\nThe types and ingredients of the sushi.\nThere are many different types of sushi. There are also many ingredients to put in the sushi.\nTypes of sushi.\nSushi in other countries.\nSushi is not only eaten in Japan. It is very popular in other countries around the Earth, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Korea.\nIngredients of sushi.\nAlthough sushi generally contains the ingredients below, virtually anything can be used in sushi, even chocolate or chicken.\nMeat.\nThere are many types of fish and other meat used in sushi, such as:\nOther meat, such as roe (fish eggs), is also used in sushi.\nVegetables.\nLike the meat, there are many types of vegetables used in sushi, such as:"}

{"id": "12753", "revid": "233259", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12753", "title": "Mount Garibaldi", "text": "Mount Garibaldi is an eroded, dacitic strato volcano in southwestern British Columbia. Both Garibaldi and Mount Baker to its south are part of the Cascade volcanic arc. Mount Garibaldi, 80\u00a0km due north of Vancouver, is made up of Mount Garibaldi, Atwell Peak,and Dalton Dome. This Pleistocene volcanic center is part of a volcanic field that contains some 13 vents in an area 30\u00a0km long by 15\u00a0km wide, much of which is in Garibaldi Provincial Park. \nThe eruptive history of Mt Garibaldi involves an initial period of volcanism (200,000-300,000 years ago) followed by a period of quiescence. Renewed activity in the last 50,000 years has rebuilt the edifice in a series of violent eruptions, like when Mount Pelee erupted in 1902 and destroyed the town of St. Pierre on the island of Martinique. As successive pyroclastic flows travelled down the mountain's gentle slopes and were deposited, the volcano took on a broad, conical form. Part of the volcano's southwest flank built out onto thick glacial ice filling the Squamish River valley. Subsequent rapid melting of the ice at the close of the last ice age removed support from the western part of the cone. The volcano collapsed,producing much of the existing rugged topography of Mount Garibaldi and Atwell Peak. This catastrophic failure left a scarp on which is exposed the internal structure of the volcano and a debris fan with an estimated volume of 150,000,000 m at the foot of the mountain north of the town of Squamish. As valley glaciers retreated, two lava flows erupted Clinker Peak, immediately north of Mt. Garibaldi. The northernmost Rubble Creek flow was party confined by a wall of ice, resulting in a lava flow over 244\u00a0m (800\u00a0ft) thick. The steep, northern edge of the Rubble Creek flow party collapsed several times, most recently in 1855-1856; the village of Garibaldi was abandoned because of the danger of future collapses. The most recent period of activity occurred shortly after the disappearance of the glacial ice filling the valley, 10,700 to 9,300 radiocarbon years ago, and ended with the eruption the Ring Creek lava flow from Opal cone on Garibaldi's southeastern flank.\nThe Ring Creek flow is very unusual. It is 15\u00a0km long - a length usually only attained by basalt flows,except that the Ring Creek flow is dacite. Renewed volcanism in the Garibaldi area would pose a serious threat to the local communities of Whistler and Squamish. Although no\nPlinian-style eruptions are known, even Pelean-type eruptions could produce large quantities of ash that could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano. As it is close to Vancouver, this would make it a hazard for air traffic. The danger from lava flows would be low to moderate because the nature of the lavas would prevent them from travelling far from their source,even though the Ring Creek lava flow ends only 6\u00a0km from Squamish. Melting of remnant glacial ice capping the Mt. Garibaldi area could produce floods, lahars,or debris flows that might endanger small communities including Brackendale.\nHighway 99, which links Whistler and Squamish with Vancouver, is already plagued by landslides and dedris flows from the precipitous Coast Mountains. An eruption producing floods could destroy segments of the highway. Flooding and debris flows could also have serious coneequences for the salmon fishery on the Squamish, Cheakamus, and Mamquam rivers. In addition,explosive eruptions and the accompanying ash could cause short and long-term water-supply problems for Vancouver and much of the lower mainland. The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from the Garibaldi area. Air-fall material could also have a deleterious effect on the ice fields to the east of Mt. Garibaldi, causing increased melting and spring flooding. This in turn could theaten water supplies from Pitt Lake as well as fisheries on the Pitt River."}
{"id": "12754", "revid": "756599", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12754", "title": "Mount Meager", "text": "Mount Meager is a potentially active volcano in the Canadian province of British Columbia, Canada, 150 kilometers north of Vancouver. The top of the mountain is mostly covered by snow and glaciers. It lies in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is the northernmost volcano of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that extends down to northern California. Its most common type of rock is lava that is almost a million years old (with a thickness in some places over 1\u00a0km).\nThe mountain is part of the Pacific Ranges of mountains and is 2,680 meters (8,793 feet) high. It was previously called \"Cathedral Mountain\".\nGeologic history.\nMeager is known for its last major eruption about 2,350 years ago. The strange thing about the eruption was the fact it released the debris from the northeast side of the volcano, as rock and ash blocked a major river called the Lillooet River. The river was dammed to a height of at least 100 meters, forming a lake. The lake reached a maximum elevation of 810 meters and was at least 50 meters deep. The breccia soon eroded from water activity within the lake, forming Keyhole Falls. There was a massive flood when the water first broke through the breccia, carrying small house sized blocks of breccia. During this eruption, ash was hurled into the air over 20 kilometers above sea level. The ash was carried eastward as far as Alberta.\nVolcanic hazards.\nMeager is an unstable volcano. It is built of unstable volcanic and has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Perberton Valley at least three times during the last 7,300 years. Two earlier debris flows, around 4,450 and 7,300 years ago, sent rubble at least 32 kilometers from the volcano. Recently, the volcano has created smaller landslides about every ten years, including one in 1975 that killed four geologists near Meager Creek. Logging, mining, tourism and wilderness recreation on nearby slopes and valleys are vulnerable to the volcano\u2019s excellent geomorphic activity. The possibility of Mount Meager covering settled parts of the Pemberton Valley in a debris flow is estimated at about one in 2400 years. There is no sign of volcanic eruptions with these events, however scientists warn the volcano could release another massive debris flow over populated areas anytime without warning.\nThe explosive nature of past eruptions at Mount Meager indicates that this volcano also poses a considerable long-distance treat to communities across southern British Columbia and Alberta. It is also a local treat to the town of Pemberton, British Columbia, about 50\u00a0km away. Another explosive eruption at Mount Meager would also have a considerable impact on local mining and logging operations, as well as significant negative impacts on the Lillooet River fishery."}

It concerns existence and the nature of things that exist. Altogether it is a theory of reality.\nOntology is the part of metaphysics which discusses \"what\" exists: the categories of being. Apart from ontology, metaphysics concerns the \"nature\" of, and \"relations\" among, the things that exist.\nThe metaphysical idea that reality exists independently of one's mind and yet can be known is called realism. The metaphysical idea that no mind-independent reality exists or can be known is idealism. These are two main battlegrounds of metaphysics.\nHistory.\nNatural philosophy.\nIn the West, metaphysics is usually traced to the natural philosophers in ancient Greece, where Aristotle systematized a metaphysical description of nature equivalent to today's theoretical science. \nBy the 4th century AD in Alexandria, Egypt, alchemy was starting its transformation into chemistry. The conventional view is that alchemy was steeped in mysticism, and that chemistry did not quite become what we would call science until it entered the 19th century.\nScience.\nIn the early 17th century, Galileo introduced to physics his experiments with earthly objects: the dawn of empirical science in Western Europe. Galilean laws of motion led to the overthrow of Aristotle's ideas, a revolution more or less completed by the wide acceptance of Cartesian physics, built upon Copernican and Galilean mechanics.\nNewtonian physics rapidly replaced Cartesian physics. Isaac Newton, like others that we now call \"scientists\", was known as a \"natural philosopher\". In the 1830s, Auguste Comte created positivism, the first modern philosophy of science. It sought the divorce of science from religion and metaphysics.\nIn 1847, Hermann von Helmholtz's paper \"On the conservation of energy\", stated the first law of thermodynamics, and tried to reduce physiology to physics. In 1859, Darwin proposed an explanation of evolution by natural selection. Both seemed plausible and compatible with physical theory.\nCommon use.\nBy the 1860s, the term \"science\" (as meaning something distinct from \"philosophy\") entered the dictionary. Today the term \"metaphysics\" usually refers to discussion of aspects of reality which are beyond physics. Particularly among those seeking to be scientific, the term \"metaphysics\" can be pejorative to varying degrees. However, philosophers of science recognize that science is impossible without metaphysics. At the very least, before beginning empirical investigation, one needs an ontology. This is because categories are needed to sort observations into."}

Most live in the western part of Washington, which gets more rain. About a quarter of the people live in the east part, where it gets less rain, and some parts have a desert climate. The largest city on the east part is Spokane, and it is also the second biggest city in the state. The Cascade Mountains go down the middle of the state and break it into two sides.

As a decimal, it is written as 0.09090909... In this example, the group of digits 09 repeats.\nAlso, sometimes the digits repeat \"after\" another group of digits. An example is formula_10. It is written as 0.16666666... In this example, the digit 6 repeats, following the digit 1.\nIf you try this on your calculator, sometimes it may make a rounding error at the end. For instance, your calculator may say that formula_11, even though there is no 7. It rounds the 6 at the end up to 7.\nIrrational numbers.\nThe digits after the decimal point in an irrational number do not repeat in an infinite pattern. For instance, the first several digits of \u03c0 (Pi) are 3.1415926535... A few of the digits repeat, but they never start repeating in an infinite pattern, no matter how far you go to the right of the decimal point."}

{"id": "12819", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12819", "title": "Edgar Cayce", "text": "Edgar Cayce (March 18, 1877 \u2013 January 3, 1945), known as \"The Sleeping Prophet\" and \"America's Greatest Mystic\", is one of America's famous psychics. He wanted people to think of him as a healer and not a psychic.\nMethods.\nCayce worked in a trance. This means he could talk while sleeping and answered questions about a person's health, past and future. This information is called \"readings\". At first, these readings were about the physical health of the person (\"physical readings\"). Later, there were readings on \"past lives\", \"business advice\", \"dream interpretation\", and also \"mental or spiritual health\". The Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE) currently takes care of all of his readings and follow-ups to the readings. The readings have had a large effect on New Age thinking.\nLife history.\nEdgar Cayce was born on March 18,1877 near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He read the Bible many times starting when he was 10 years old. He wanted to tell people about God and heal them. His family worked on a farm.\nFirst jobs.\nHis family moved to Hopkinsville in December, 1893. Edgar's first jobs (1894 \u2013 1898) were at Richard's Dry Goods Store. He next worked in Hopper's Bookstore. Both stores were located on Main Street. He married Gertrude Evans in 1903.\nBusiness.\nIn 1900, Cayce went into business with his father. They sold insurance. Cayce became very sick with laryngitis in March. In April 18, he could not talk at all. He had to live at home with his parents for almost a year. He became a photographer because it did not require talking. He worked in the photography studio of W. R. Bowles in Hopkinsville.\nFirst hypnotist job.\nA hypnotist and entertainer called Hart was entertaining at the Hopkinsville Opera House in 1901. He heard that Cayce was sick and asked if he could try to cure him. Cayce said yes and the entertainer tried to cure Cayce in front of an audience. Cayce was able to talk while in a hypnotic trance but when he woke up he could not talk. Hart hypnotized Cayce so that his voice would be normal after the trance but Cayce's voice did not become normal.\nHypnotism in depth.\nHart had to leave. Another hypnotist, Al Layne, continued to help Cayce have a normal voice. Layne asked Cayce to tell him the cause of his illness and it's cure while in a trance. Cayce described his illness from a first person plural point of view \u2013 'we' \u2013 instead of the singular \"I.\" In later readings, he would usually start off with \"We have the body.\" In the reading, Cayce said his voice loss was because of psychological paralysis and that could be fixed by increasing the blood flow to the voice box. Layne suggested that the blood flow be increased and Cayce's face turned red with blood and his chest area turned bright red. After 20 minutes, Cayce, still in a trance, said the treatment was over. When he woke up his voice stayed normal. He would get sick again, but was cured by Layne in the same way and later he was cured perfectly.\nFame.\nCayce's work grew as his fame grew. He asked for people to give him money to support himself and his family so that he could work full-time. He continued to work in a trance state with a hypnotist all his life. His wife and oldest son later replaced Layne in this role. A secretary, Gladys Davis, took notes. Many believe that Cayce had an affair with Ms. Davis later in life - but a medical examination conducted after Cayce's death to treat Davis's uterine cancer allegedly showed that she was still a virgin at that time.\nIn 1929 the Cayce hospital was created in Virginia Beach. The cost of the hospital was paid for by Morton Blumenthal, a New York stockbroker, Cayce hospital benefactor.\nCayce became famous in the United States in 1943 because of an article in \"Coronet\" magazine. He increased his readings to 8 times a day to try to keep up. This caused problems with his health.\nProblems.\nThe trance reading caused problems with Cayce\u2019s health which were easily seen. On the times when he could not give a clear reading, he said it was because he was working under too great a pressure. In these cases, he always gave the money back to the person he was giving a reading to.\nEdgar Cayce died on January 3, 1945. He had predicted his own death four days earlier.\nReadings.\nEdgar Cayce is famous for the thousands of \"readings\" that he gave while he was hypnotized. He gave more than 14,000 readings in 43 years. Gladys Davis, his assistant, recorded the readings and his wife, Gertrude Evans Cayce, guided him during hypnosis.\nPhysical readings.\nIn the beginning, his readings were known as \"physical readings\" (health readings). Cayce often called the body \"the organism\". Cayce would put himself under self-hypnosis. While he seemed to sleep, he would say where the person was. He would sometimes name the streets along the way. He would then say \"Yes, we see the body\", and describe the client's organ, circulatory, and nervous systems. He would give reasons for illness or problems. A message would then be given to the person telling them how to get better. The readings were so specialized that treatments were often changed, or not even given, if the person would not follow his advice. People often came to Cayce for health readings when the medical community could find nothing wrong or had given up on them.\nLife readings.\nIn a life reading, Cayce described the \"past lives\" of the client. These readings described the client's present physical, emotional and mental condition in terms of past life experience. Cayce was not above flattering his clients by describing past lives as royalty, famous people, or people at their \"spiritual highest\".\nBusiness readings.\nFor those people whose intentions Cayce believed to be \"pure\", Cayce would give business readings. These included advice on business partners, the stock market, and business models. Cayce also founded and guided the A.R.E..\nDream readings.\nEdgar Cayce encouraged everyone to interpret and use his or her own dreams in day-to-day life. A dream reading involved Cayce interpreting the dreams of clients. As he did with readings on many subjects, Cayce would often interrupt the person reading the dream and give an interpretation before the dream had been completely read. He would sometimes fill in parts of dreams that the dreamer had supposedly forgotten. Unlike Jungian or Freudian dream interpretation, Cayce did not emphasize highly the importance of symbols. He said that every individual has his or her own unique symbols. Cayce claimed that in dreams people could receive valuable insight into their own lives and that the insight was always of use to the dreamer. Besides regular daily insight into one's life, he claimed people could communicate with loved ones dead or alive, remember past life experiences, see a possible future and experience many other psychic phenomena. He stated that these paranormal abilities were something anyone could learn.\nMental and Spiritual readings.\nThese readings were often short and were Cayce's favorite type of reading when not in his supposed trance state. They focused on what an individual could do to achieve a better mental/spiritual life.\nOther readings.\nOther Readings are miscellaneous subject matter that does not fit into an above category. The subject matter differs from missing persons, buried treasure, readings given to a spiritual development group, psychic abilities, auras, prophecy, structure of reality, geology and many other topics.\nImpact.\nFor many people, the readings had a powerful impact on attitudes, beliefs, health practices, outlook on life, matters of faith and many other areas.\nClaimed abilities.\nAbilities that have been claimed for Cayce include:\nCayce himself did not claim to be able to do all these things.\nFormer lives and conflict with Christian doctrine.\nCayce had difficulty in believing some of the things he said when he was hypnotized. For example, having been raised a devout Christian, for a long time he could not believe that reincarnation was real. Books such as Frederick Oliver's A Dweller On Two Planets and Marie Corelli's novels were probably easily accessible to Cayce at his bookstore. Corelli's writings in particular seek to reconcile mystical beliefs such as reincarnation with Christianity, and Cayce may have been subconsciously trying to accept this idea.\nReincarnation.\nCayce also claimed while in a supposed trance that the Essenes had believed in reincarnation but that view was expunged from the Bible following a papal council decision in around 500 AD. Essene belief in reincarnation is debatable , as with ancient Egyptian religion.\nClaimed reincarnation.\nDuring a hypnosis session, Cayce mentioned a former life as Ra Ta, an Egyptian healer-priest. He told a long story about working with the legendary doctor-magician Hermes-Thoth, who he said was reincarnated as Jesus. Cayce also specified that Jesus had lived a number of incarnations throughout human history.\nA Reading About the Readings in Terms of Religion.\nOne of Cayce's trance statements implies that knowledge gained through his readings is \"not\" necessary if a person is well grounded in one's faith: \"Does it make one a better husband, a better businessman, a better neighbor, a better artist, a better churchman, if so cleave to it, if not reject it.\"\nThe readings also warn against the misuse of religion for personal gain. 'God is not mocked' is an often quoted verse in the readings.\nDisbelief and criticism.\nSkepticism.\nMany skeptics say that Cayce did not have paranormal abilities. Cayce himself said that not all the information given during \"readings\" was correct and should be analyzed. He criticized his own organization, the A.R.E , on a number of occasions for not doing enough research on the validity of the readings.\nProblems.\nIn addition, although Cayce's secretary Miss Davis allegedly took down what Cayce said, the records of the readings are jumbled and chaotic. There is nothing to distinguish what Cayce himself independently said, what was the information provided in the letters, and what his handlers \u2013 physicians, osteopaths and hypnotists \u2013 told him. Thus, researchers cannot say that Cayce ever made an accurate diagnosis without knowing anything about the person at the other end. What is known is that by the time he got some of the letters, the client had already died. Yet Cayce went on with his reading for the individual as though still alive.\nVagueness.\nCritics also cite the vagueness of his language while in his supposed trance state. Martin Gardner gives several examples of this, including a reading Cayce did for his own wife, who had tuberculosis:\n\"[F]rom the head, pains along through the body from the second, fifth and sixth dorsals, and from the first and second lumbar ... tie-ups here, floating lesions, or lateral lesions, in the muscular and nerve fibers which supply the lower end of the lung and the diaphragm ... in conjunction with the sympathetic nerve of the solar plexus, coming in conjunction with the solar plexus at the end of the stomach...\"\nHealth readings.\nMany of his health readings prescribed cures with ingredients that did not exist. Others were folk remedies, some well known to today's herbalists and naturopaths, but Cayce would sometimes describe them using terms that had fallen out of general use. Still other ingredients were completely unknown to either physicians or herbalists. Some were completely worthless; for example, Cayce once recommended breathing the fumes of apple brandy from a charred keg to cure tuberculosis.\nFinal words.\nThe many Cayce readings would later become commonly known practices of the New Age movement.\nIn 1931 Edgar Cayce founded the Association for Research and Enlightenment, Inc. (A.R.E.) headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Today there are Edgar Cayce Centers in 18 other countries throughout the world."}

It has a population of 884.320 people (estimate from the year 2000) and a total area of 512 square km. \nThe city attracts many tourists and it enjoys an important location between the Atlantic Ocean and the Munda\u00fa Lake. Macei\u00f3 has several urban beaches which are visited by many tourists, for example, the beaches named Paju\u00e7ara, Ponta Verde, Jati\u00faca and Cruz das Almas, famous for their natural beauty.\nMacei\u00f3 originated from a sugar cane engine where initially a village increased around it. Soon the place gained a port, nowadays in Jaragu\u00e1 district, that as long as years were gone influenced the village development transforming it into a city. Its condition of port city made Macei\u00f3 to be the state capital in 1839, which was earlier on Santa Maria Madalena da Alagoa do Sul (Saint Mary Magdalene of the Southern Lake) or simply Alagoa do Sul (nowadays the historic city of Marechal Deodoro).\nMain neighborhoods.\n\"Pajussara\"\nThe community of Pajussara is on the ocean coast of Macei\u00f3, with modern streets and avenues, many shops, clubs and hotels in front of the sea. Its beach is very attractive and visited by many tourists and natives. In Pajussara beach, a nice place to go is a natural swimming pool 1.500 meters east of the coast and that is placed on a sand bank of the Atlantic Ocean. The pool is formed only when tide is low and people can get there by boat. \n\"Ponta Verde\"\nIt is considered the most beautiful beach in the city. The community started from an old little farm named Ponta Verde that gave the neighborhood its name. The long extension of land was full of coconut trees and was a wild and quiet place. Currently the urbanization has taken all the area of Ponta Verde and many important events and shows of the city have happened there. The place has good hotels and restaurants and some of them are the best ones in the city.\n\"Farol\"\nFarol means lighthouse in Portuguese. The community is in an elevated area not far from the sea where the old lighthouse was that aided the ships to come in the port of the city. From this place is possible to see as the Atlantic Ocean as the Munda\u00fa Lake and because of this the area was strategically important to military force in the Colonial age. \n\"Jati\u00faca\"\nJati\u00faca, besides Ponta Verde, is one of the most valued areas in the city in the ranking of the properties salesmen. It is a place with very nice hotels, resorts and restaurants that enjoy a good location in front of the sea. The seacoast in Jati\u00faca has a lot of beach bars.\n\"Jaragu\u00e1\" \nJaragu\u00e1 has a historic importance because it is the initial point of the city and could be appropriately named Old Town. Macei\u00f3 was just a village when the port of Jaragu\u00e1 helped the little village to become a city in the 19th century. Currently some old buildings were transformed in bars and restaurants that are very attended at the weekends but the history of Macei\u00f3 keeps preserved in many of the old and classic buildings, houses, manors and churches of Jaragu\u00e1.\n\"Pontal da Barra\"\nThe earlier dunes between the Munda\u00fa Lake and the Atlantic Ocean gave place later to the community of fishermen and crafts men and women that currently inhabit this portion of land on the south of the city. Hospitality and beautiful handcrafts are good characteristics of this place. This is because the community of Pontal enjoy to welcome lots of visitors amazed with the incredible ability of the craft workers and the good taste of the typical seafood dishes."}

He wrote books that are very important in the fields of maths, physics and especially philosophy. His dualism statement combined soul, mind, body theories and elements into one concept; a dualistic theory of mind and matter.\nIn younger years he was a mercenary soldier.\nDescartes and physics (the study of the world).\nIn his \"Rules for the Direction of the Mind\" (1628) and his \"Discourse on Method\" (1637) Descartes wrote about the scientific method that deals with scientific approach, thinking, a method which he had invented. He also wrote about shapes (Geometry), light (optics), and the weather (Meteorology). He then invented a way of describing shapes now called the Cartesian coordinate system, and a theory of what a rainbow is. Descartes' physics was important for a later famous thinker, Sir Isaac Newton, who said about him and so did James Hook: \"If I have seen further it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants!\"\nDescartes and philosophy (the study of abstract ideas).\nIn his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" (1641) Descartes used his scientific method to look at philosophical questions. He argued against skepticism (the view that the world was not real, and did not exist).\nHe found that he himself must be real (exist), because he felt that he was thinking; and if he was thinking, then he must be real. This is because if he were not real, then how would he have this feeling that he was thinking. He shortened this view, saying in Latin, \"Cogito ergo sum,\" meaning \"I think, therefore I am.\"\nHe also thought he could show that God exists, in the same way that he felt that he was thinking. Descartes said that God was the same as infinity and that he could clearly see infinity because he could think of every larger object but no largest object. Descartes said that if God exists then the world must exist as well, since God was good and would not let us think the world is real (exists) if it was not real.\nFinally, Descartes thought that because he knew he was thinking, but could only know anything else about himself (for example that he had two arms and two legs) because he knew that God exists, then he must be made up of two things: the mind that thinks and the body that is independent of thinking, yet they are united together. This is called \"Cartesian Dualism\".\nDescartes used a lot of ideas related to Plato, while most people at that time used ideas related to Aristotle. He is often called a rationalist, because he looked inside his mind for answers to his questions. Although Descartes wanted to fight skepticism, his description of it in the meditations has become very famous and is often called Cartesian Skepticism after him."}

It is one of the most important cars in history because it was one of the first cars to be sold for very little money, making it easy for people to travel from place to place.\nImportance.\nThe Model T, also known as the \"Tin Lizzie\", changed the way Americans live, work and travel. Henry Ford\u2019s revolutionary advancements in assembly-line automobile manufacturing made the Model T the first car to be affordable for a majority of Americans. For the first time car ownership became a reality for average American workers, not just the wealthy. More than fifteen million Model Ts were built in Detroit and Highland Park, Michigan, and the automobile was also assembled at a Ford plant in Manchester, England, and at plants in continental Europe.\nBefore the Model T, most cars cost lots of money. Only rich people could afford them. Even Ford's cars before the Model T cost a lot. The Model T went for around $980. A car built in 1903 called the Oldsmobile Curved Dash was very easy to buy, but was a very simple and slow car that was more like a carriage than a car.\nEven before it lost favor to larger, more powerful, and more luxurious cars, the Model T, known popularly as the \"Tin Lizzie\" or the \"flivver\", had become an American folkloric symbol, essentially realizing Ford\u2019s goal to \"democratize the automobile\".\nThe man who owned the company, Henry Ford, heard about meat being cut on a disassembly line, which moved meat from worker to worker so that the meat could be cut up. Assembly lines were not much used at the time. Ford knew that if he built his cars on an assembly line instead of one at a time like other cars, he could make a car that anyone could afford and would be built like cars that cost more money. He also knew that he could pay his workers more money. \nThe Model T was offered in several body styles, including a five-seat touring car, a two-seat runabout, and a seven-seat town car. All bodies were mounted on a uniform 100-inch (2.5m)-wheelbase chassis. A choice of colors was originally available, but from 1913 to 1925 the car was mass-produced in only one color\u2014black. The engine was simple and efficient, with all four cylinders cast in a single block and the cylinder head detachable for easy access and repair. The engine generated 20 horsepower and propelled the car to modest top speeds of 40\u201345 miles per hour (65\u201370 km/h). In most models the engine was started by a hand crank, which activated a magneto connected to the flywheel, but after 1920 some models were equipped with battery-powered starters. \nThe transmission, having two forward gears and one reverse, was of the planetary type, controlled by foot pedals rather than the more common hand lever used in sliding-gear transmissions. Spark and throttle were controlled by a hand lever on the steering column. The ten gallon fuel tank was located under the front seat. Because gasoline was fed to the engine only by gravity, and also because the reverse gear offered more power than the forward gears, the Model T frequently had to be driven up a steep hill backward. Such deficiencies, along with its homely appearance, less-than-comfortable ride at top speeds, and incessant rattling, made the Model T the butt of much affectionate humor in innumerable jokes, songs, poems, and stories.\nHistory.\nThe Ford Model T car was designed by Henry Ford, Childe Harolde Wills, and two Hungarian men named J\u00f3zsef Galamb and Eugene Farkas. The Model T had a 177-cubic-inch (2.9-litre) four-cylinder engine producing 20 horsepower (15 kW) for a top speed of 45 miles per hour (72 km/h). The engine had side valves and three main bearings. Fuel economy was 14 to 21 miles per gallon (11 to 17 l/100km).\nFord began building the Model T in his Piquette factory on October 6, 1908 as a 1909 model. Workers from all over the world wanted to work for Ford because of the good pay. Workers could even save their money for a Model T of their own. The price of the Model T dropped over the years, making it even easier to buy.\nWork began at one end of the assembly line, starting with an empty chassis. From there, the chassis moved slowly down the assembly line. Workers on the assembly line added parts to the chassis. Before long, a new Model T rolled off the other end of the line. Different body styles were available, even a truck, or Model TT. At first, the only color available was black. Black paint was used because it was cheaper and lasted longer than other paints and Ford was obsessed with increasing profit. As car paint got better over the years, Ford began offering other colors. The time it took a chassis to become a finished car was over 12 hours when the first Model Ts were built. By the time the last Model T came off of the line, Ford had so many plants, it was making one car every twenty-seven seconds!\nEven though the Model T sold for little money, Ford used the best materials he could buy to make his car. Most roads in the Model T's day were dirt, gravel, or even mud. That meant the Model T had to be very strong, and it was. The wheels and tyres were very tall and skinny so that they could sink into mud roads and not get stuck. It was also very simple.\nOperation.\nFord made the Model T easy to drive compared to today's cars since the people to whom he sold his cars did not know how to drive anything other than a horse. It is not like driving a modern car, though three pedals are on the floor like a modern manual transmission car. A Model T has a steering wheel that works the same way as in cars of today, but almost everything else is different.\nThe first Model Ts did not even have a starter like a modern car. This is the powerful electric motor in a car that turns the engine to make it run when it is turned off. The engine on the Model T was started with a hand crank on the front of the car. A wire loop near the radiator worked the choke on the carburetor to give the engine extra fuel to help start it when it was cold. This could be dangerous if the operator was not careful. If the levers that controlled the engine were not set the right way, especially the spark control, the engine could backfire, or spin the wrong way. Many people got broken arms this way. Doctors even had a name for this kind of break: the \"Ford fracture\". Many Model T owners added electric starters to their cars and it was not long before Ford started doing the same. A Model T is in high gear by default, so if the parking/clutch lever was not engaged, the car had a tendency to run over the operator when started. \nTo make a modern car go or accelerate once the engine is running, a person steps on a pedal on the floor to engage the transmission into low gear. To make a Model T accelerate, move two levers near the steering wheel. The lever on the right was the throttle (or engine speed), and the lever on the left adjusted the time that the spark plugs fired. These levers needed to be set properly before the engine could be started.\nThe three pedals on the floor of the Model T were for the brake on the right, reverse in the middle to make the Model T go backwards, and a pedal on the left to shift the gears from low to high speed. A lever on the floor worked the brakes as well as the clutch. Pulling the lever toward the driver would set the parking brake and help keep the car from moving while parked. When the lever was placed in the middle, the transmission would be in neutral.\nOnce the engine is running, the driver now has to make the Model T move on its own. Step on the pedal all the way to the left, move the throttle lever to \"give it the gas\" and gently move the floor lever forward. This is low gear, the powerful gear used to get the Model T moving. Once it is moving, move the right lever up, let the left pedal come all the way up, and give it more gas to shift into high. To make the car go faster still, move the throttle lever as well as the spark advance lever. Stepping on the left pedal only halfway puts the car in neutral, the same as the lever. This helps the Model T come to a stop without causing the engine to stop as well.\nThe brakes on a Model T work the rear wheels by the use of brake bands inside the transmission. Modern cars have brakes on all four wheels. No brakes are on the front wheels of a Model T.\nMore than fifteen million Model Ts were built. That record was not broken until 1971 by the Volkswagen Golf. Today, the record for the most cars built is held by the Toyota Corolla.\nThe Model T was nicknamed the \"Tin Lizzie\" and \"Flivver\" by the people who drove it. A new car took the place of the Model T in 1928, named the Ford Model A."}

The word \"volkswagen\" means \"People's car\" in German. Its headquarters are in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony. It was started in the 1930s, at the request of the country's leader, Adolf Hitler, to produce a car designed by Ferdinand Porsche.\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s Adolf Hitler was looking for someone who could make a cheap car that the common German worker could afford. At the same time, Ferdinand Porsche had been working for years on a cheap car that could hold a family and would drive like a real car, not a micro car. He had already designed and built small cars with rear engines and shaped like a beetle (for better aerodynamics). At this time, owning a car in Germany was something only for the rich people, and most car companies were not interested in making a low-cost car. Porsche's company, also called Porsche, only made designs for others at that time. So Porsche could not find anyone to make the small car that he wanted.\nThough Hitler never learned to drive, he was very interested in cars (he also created the autobahn, which led to the U.S. interstate highways). Hitler wanted the car to hold four people. It was to be cooled by oil instead of water. The car needed to be able to travel at least 100\u00a0km/h, or about 60\u00a0mph, and use no more than 7 liters of gasoline for 100 kilometers (about 34 mpg). The car companies in Germany at the time didn't want to make this new low-cost car, so Hitler formed a new company, run by the government. The first name given to the car was \"KdF-Wagen.\" \"KdF\" stood for \"Kraft durch Freude\", or \"Strength through Joy.\" Some were made, but by the time the factory was finished in 1938, World War II started. The factory then built jeep-like cars for the German military instead. \nAfter the war, people from the United Kingdom and the United States reopened the factory and started making cars again. The factory was in ruins from the war and could only make a few cars at a time. The British military were in charge of this section of Germany. At first they tried to find another car company to rebuild the factory. Henry Ford was offered the company for free. After looking it over, his adviser said \"Mr. Ford, what we are being offered here is not worth a damn!\" So the Volkswagen company went ahead by itself to make the car. The man who led the Volkswagen company during this time was Heinz Nordhoff.\nAt first they only made one type of car, the Volkswagen Beetle. (It was simply called the Type 1 Sedan by the company, it also had the nickname \"Bug\" in the U.S. and other nicknames elsewhere). In 1950, the Type 2 (the bus) was introduced, also built with an engine in the back of the vehicle. The cars became popular and well-known all over the world. The Beetle later became one of the best selling cars in history. It was built for many years afterward in factories in Germany, Brazil and Mexico.\nThe last original Volkswagen Beetle to be built was built in Mexico. It was built in July of 2003. Volkswagen has a new car called the \"New Beetle.\" which began selling in 1997, It looks like the old car, but is built quite differently. It is faster, safer, and has an engine in the front, not the back, and is water-cooled (using a radiator). It is much more suited to today's modern world in terms of design and security.\nVolkswagen is currently involved in an emissions test scandal.\nRecent vehicles.\nSome of Volkswagen's popular cars are the Golf, Jetta, Polo,Beetle and the Passat. VW's as they are commonly known, have also entered the off road segment with cars like the Touarag, and the commercial segment with the Touran. This year sees VW's 21st anniversary since the Golf 1 went on sale in the 1980s. Since its birth VW has sold over 315,000 units of the Golf 1 alone. 2006 saw the entry of the fifth generation of the Golf. The flagbearer - the GTI - is powered by a 147Kw 2.0l 4 cylinder turbo charged engine,with VW DSG and FSI technology. The Golf GTI has evolved a long way since the 80's but the fifth generation GTI is criticised by some as it does not live up to the expectations and standards set by the legendary Mk1 GTI, which was fitted with an 1600, 8 valve motor.\nModels.\nWater-cooled.\nThe water-cooled line was started in 1974."}

It is set in Italy and is about the love between two young people from noble families that are enemies. \"Romeo and Juliet\" has always been one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. It has been adapted to opera, ballet, television productions, and movies. \nStory.\nThe noble families of the Montagues and the Capulets live in the city of Verona. Both families are enemies, and even their servants get into fights with each other. Prince Escalus, the ruler of the city, tells the families to stop fighting or they will be punished. \nMontague has only one child, a teenage boy called Romeo. Capulet also has only one child, a beautiful 14-year-old daughter called Juliet. One evening, Romeo sneaks into a party at the Capulet's house. He meets Juliet and they fall in love with each other. Later on, Romeo overhears Juliet standing on her balcony admitting her love for him. He reveals himself and they agree to be married. Friar Laurence agrees to marry them in secret the next day. \nJuliet's cousin Tybalt confronts Romeo, angry that he sneaked into the party. Romeo's friend Mercutio steps in and fights Tybalt. Tybalt kills Mercutio, so Romeo takes revenge and kills Tybalt. The Prince orders Romeo to leave the city, and warns he will be executed if he returns. Romeo secretly spends the night with Juliet before leaving the next morning. \nJuliet is left upset after Romeo leaves. To cheer her up, her parents arrange for her to quickly marry Paris, a cousin of the Prince. This only makes it worse. Juliet refuses, so her father threatens to kick her out if she doesn't marry Paris. Friar Laurence suggests a drug that can put her to sleep for a few hours, so that she can pretend to be dead, so that she can sneak out with Romeo. The Friar sends a message to Romeo to tell him about the plan. Juliet takes the drug and her family, thinking her to be dead, lay her in the family tomb. But before the messenger can reach Romeo, he learns of Juliet's \"death\" from someone else and believes she is really dead. \nRomeo goes to the tomb and is discovered by Paris, who has also come to mourn her. They fight, and Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, Romeo poisons himself. Juliet wakes up, but when she sees that Romeo is dead, she stabs herself. The play ends with the families and the Prince entering the tomb and discovering them dead. In their sadness, the families agree they should no longer be enemies with each other. \nAbout the play.\nBecause this play was written in the 1500's, the English language that it uses is not exactly like the English that is used today. Some of the play is written in poetry.\nForm.\n\"Romeo and Juliet\", like many of Shakespeare's plays, is written in several different forms. \nThe Balcony scene.\nOf all the scenes that have ever been written in plays, one of the most famous is in \"Romeo and Juliet\". \nAfter Romeo and Juliet have met at a party and fallen in love, Juliet goes up to bed. But she cannot sleep so she stands at her window and pretends she is talking with Romeo. \nRomeo climbs up onto the balcony. Juliet tells Romeo that her love for him is as deep and endless as the sea. They part from each other with the famous words:\nThis romantic scene has been acted and copied many times, sometimes seriously and sometimes for fun.

Rock music combines many kinds of music from the United States, such as country music, folk music, gospel music, work, blues and jazz. \nRock and roll developed in the early 1950s from a kind of music called rhythm and blues performed by black singers and musicians. At first, this music was popular only with African-Americans. In the later 1950s and in the 1960s, rock and roll became popular across the United States and in Europe.\nHistory of rock and roll.\n1950s: Rockabilly.\nDuring the early 1950s, the popularity of rhythm and blues music spread. It became very popular among young white people. They listened to this music on radio stations that broadcast across the country late at night. Some teenagers began buying rhythm and blues records as a form of rebellion. \nThis music was very different from the music that was popular with most of their parents. The music was exciting, and it had a very strong rhythm and beat. Some of the songs had words which suggested sexual themes. In other cases, the singers made sexually suggestive gestures or movements while they were singing. Some adults strongly objected to rhythm and blues music. They did not think young people should listen to it.\nAlan Freed had a radio show in Cleveland, Ohio in the early 1950s. He is said to be the first person to use the expression \"rock and roll\" to describe rhythm and blues music. Alan Freed was one of the first to play rock and roll music on his radio show, and he organized the first rock and roll concert in Cleveland in 1952.\nSongs by black performers like Jimmy Hendrix and Little Richard soon became popular with teenagers. These singers recorded their records in the southern city of New Orleans, Louisiana.\nSome early rock and roll music was created in the southern United States city of Memphis, Tennessee. In Memphis, a white record producer called Sam Phillips produced records by local black musicians. One day, an eighteen-year-old truck driver came to his studio to record a song for his mother. The young man was Elvis Presley. Phillips produced Presley's first real record in 1954, a song called \"That's All Right.\"\nBill Haley and his Comets recorded \"Rock Around the Clock\" in 1954. It was not popular at first. Then it was used in a movie about rebellious teenagers, called \"The Blackboard Jungle\". The movie caused a lot of debate on the origin of rock and roll. It also made the song a huge hit. \"Rock Around the Clock\" became a song of teenage rebellion. The song was recorded in April, Elvis' \"That's All Right\" was recorded in July. However, Cecil's Grant's 'We're Gonna Rock' recorded in mid 1950 is a song that many people have forgotten that was an early influence on rock n roll. Its lyrics and music were like those that would be in later songs. The drums and bass guitar would be similar to rock and roll songs that would be made later. \nMany other rock and roll singers became popular in the 1950s. They included Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. Each performer created his own kind of rock and roll. Chuck Berry's music was a mixture of country and rhythm and blues. In 1955, his song \"Maybellene\" was one of the most popular songs in the country.\nRitchie Valens, Buddy Holly, and \"Big Bopper\" all died in a plane crash in Iowa on 3 February 1959, in an event that would become known as The Day the Music Died.\nBefore Bill Haley, grant goatbeurry recorded \"Move It On Over\" in 1947, however similar version of the song was recorded by blues artist Jim Jackson called \"Kansas City Blues\". The melody is similar to both \"Move It On\" and \"Rock Around Clock\", but latter has different tonal subtleties and chords.\n1960s: From Motown to Folk Rock.\nMotown: African-American popular music.\nIn the 1960s, black music and musicians became recognized as an important part of the music industry in America. This was because a company in Detroit, Michigan, called Motown Records that produced some of the most popular songs in American music. Berry Gordy started Motown Records. He presented \"black\" music in a way that both black people and white people would like. One of Motown's most successful groups was the Supremes, led by Diana Ross. One of their hits was \"Come See About Me\".\nSurf music.\nA different kind of rock and roll music called surf music was being made in Southern California. Five young men from Los Angeles formed a group called the Beach Boys. Brian Wilson wrote, performed, and produced the group's records. The Beach Boys' songs had complex music and simple words. The words were about the local teenage culture. The group sang about riding surfboards on the ocean waves. One of their most popular songs was \"Surfin' USA,\u201d which used the same musical track as Chuck Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen.\"\nFolk rock.\nIn the 1960s, rock and roll music began to change. The words became as important as the music. Bob Dylan began writing folk rock songs that many young people considered to be poetry. Dylan was influenced by folk singers and songwriters like Woody Guthrie. Dylan's early songs were about serious social issues. He wrote about war and racial injustice. Some of his songs were used as protest songs for the anti-war and civil rights movements in America. Later, Dylan wrote more personal songs. One of his most popular songs was \u201cMister Tambourine Man,\" which many people thought was a song about drug use.\nIn 1964, a new rock and roll group from England called The Beatles visited the United States. The Beatles were very popular. They completely shaped the sixties pop era along with the Rolling Stones. They were icons, and still to this day could be considered icons.\n1970s: From Psychedelic Rock to Punk and Disco.\nRock and Psychedelic Rock.\nBy the 1970s, rock and roll was often just called \"rock\". In the 1970s, rock music bands such as Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones played huge, loud concerts in outdoor stadiums. Rock music from the 1970s was usually louder and harder than the rock and roll from the 1950s.\nIn the early 1970s, many rock bands played psychedelic rock, a type of rock music which had words that described the use of legal drugs. Psychedelic rock described the experiences of taking illegal drugs such as marijuana and LSD and often encouraged people to take illegal drugs. Psychedelic rock bands included Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company, Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, The Byrds, Pink Floyd, and The Doors.\nProgressive rock.\nAnother type of rock music from the 1970s was progressive rock. Progressive rock bands such as Pink Floyd and The Moody Blues played music that was more complex. Some progressive rock bands used strange instruments, or created music that sounded weird. \nOther progressive rock bands include: Electric Light Orchestra, Pavlov's Dog, King Crimson, Caravan, Jethro Tull, Genesis, Gentle Giant, The Nice, Yes, Gong, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Soft Machine, Steve Hillage, Barclay James Harvest, Magma, Camel, Can, Rush and Faust.\nHeavy metal.\nIn the 1970s, a harder form of rock music called \"Heavy metal\" was invented. Bands such as Cream and Led Zeppelin played loud rock music based on blues music. Other bands such Deep Purple and Black Sabbath played even louder, harder heavy metal rock music.\nDisco.\nIn the late 1970s, groups such as Donna Summer, K.C. and the Sunshine Band, Barry White, Gloria Gaynor, and CHIC, developed a pop music style called disco. Disco was dance music with a strong beat. A popular disco band was The Bee Gees, who wrote the music for the movie \"Saturday Night Fever\".\nPunk rock.\nAnother rock music style from the 1970s was punk rock. Punk rock was crude, loud, simple music. Many punk rock songs were rude or used bad words. Punk rock musicians often dressed in ripped or torn clothes, leather jackets, and black leather boots. Punk rock musicians sometimes had strange hairstyles, such as hair \"spiked\" with hair gel or shaved off. Well-known punk rock bands from Britain were the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Well-known punk musicians in the United States were the Ramones, Patti Smith, Blondie and Black Flag.\nNew wave.\nIn the late 1970s, another type of rock called New wave music became popular. Bands such as INXS and Midnight Oil from Australia became popular. In the United States, New Wave bands such as Talking Heads and Devo played. In the 1980s, New Wave music bands such as Duran Duran, A Flock of Seagulls, Psychedelic Furs, and the Eurythmics were popular. These bands used the synthesizer keyboard a lot in their songs.\n1980s.\nGlam metal.\nIn the 1980s, a new type of rock and roll was invented, called glam metal. Glam metal rock bands mixed pop music with heavy metal music. Glam metal bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, W.A.S.P. and Ratt became popular. Glam metal rock bands had long hair and the men wore make up and leather pants and boots. Many glam metal songs were about sex, illegal drug use, and drinking alcohol. In the late 1980s, groups such as Guns N' Roses were very successful.\nAlternative music.\nAnother rock music trend from the 1980s was alternative music. Bands such as R.E.M., Sonic Youth, The Smiths, Pixies, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, The Cure, and others were popular with teens and young adults. The most immediate type of alternative music was \"grunge,\" a combination of punk, rock and metal. Proponents of grunge included Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam with themes of sadness and loneliness.\nRelated pages.\nSources.\nParts of the above article reused and rewrote public domain material provided by Voice of America Special English website."}

Edison's 1093 patents were the most granted to any inventor in his time. He started the General Electric Company to make some of the things he invented. He died with \"diabetes mellitus\".\nEarly life.\nThomas Alva Edison was born in Milan, Ohio. When Thomas Edison was seven years old, he moved with his family to Port Huron, Michigan.Thomas Edison started school late because of an illness. Three months later, Edison was removed from school, because he could not pay attention to his teacher. His mother, who was a teacher in Canada, taught Thomas Edison at home. Thomas Edison's mother helped him become motivated for learning, and he was a good student to her.\nWhen Thomas Edison was twelve years old, he got scarlet fever. The effects of the fever, as well as getting picked up by the ears by a train conductor, caused Edison to become completely deaf in his left ear, and 80 percent deaf in the other. He learned Morse code of the telegraph, and began a job as a \"brass pounder\" (telegraph operator). At age sixteen, Thomas Edison made his first invention, which was called an \"automatic repeater.\" It used punched tape to send telegraph signals quickly between unmanned stations, more quickly than a telegraph operator could do.\nCareer.\nIn 1868, Edison moved East and began to work for the Western Union Company in Boston, Massachusetts as a telegraph operator. He worked twelve hours a day, six days a week, and continued to \"moonlight\" on his own projects. Within six months, he had applied for and received his first patent for an electric vote recorder. It made the voting process faster but he could not find buyers. Then, Edison moved to New York and began to work for a company fixing their machines. At night, he continued to work on his projects.\nIn 1876 Edison used the money from his inventions to start his own laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. In 1877~78, he invented there the carbon microphone, which made the sound for Alexander Graham Bell's new telephone invention louder. In 1877, Edison invented the phonograph, the first machine that could record and play sound. The phonograph made him internationally famous. How ever a new discovery proved that the French inventor \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville invented sound recording before Edison. In 1879, Edison made a light bulb that lasted longer. Another invention, the electric power distribution network, lasted even longer.\nPersonal life.\nHe married Mary Stilwell in 1871. He had three children in that marriage: Marion Estelle Edison (also called Dot), Thomas Alva Edison, Jr. (also called Dash) and William Leslie Edison. Mary Stilwell died in 1884. Thomas Edison bought some land in Florida and built a house. When he was thirty-nine, Edison married his second wife, Mina Miller, who was 19. He had 3 children in that marriage: Madeleine Edison, Charles Edison (who took over the company when his father died and was later elected Governor of New Jersey), and Theodore Miller Edison."}

{"id": "12972", "revid": "7786621", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12972", "title": "Diabetes mellitus", "text": "Diabetes is a condition that results from lack of the hormone insulin in a person's blood, or when the body has a problem using the insulin it produces (\"insulin resistance\"). There is another disease with a similar name, diabetes insipidus, however, they are not related. When people say \"diabetes\", they usually mean diabetes mellitus. People with diabetes \"Mellitus\" are called \"diabetics\".\nGlucose is not regular sugar that is available in stores and supermarkets. Glucose is a natural carbohydrate that our bodies use as a source of energy. The kind of sugar sold in supermarkets is called sucrose, and is much different from glucose. High concentrations of glucose can be found in soft drinks and fruits.\nThe glucose level in the blood is controlled by several hormones. Hormones are chemicals in the body that send messages from cells to other cells. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. When you eat, the pancreas makes insulin to send a message to other cells in the body. This insulin tells the cells to take up glucose from the blood. The glucose is used by cells for energy. Extra glucose that is not needed right away is stored in some cells as glycogen. When you are not eating, cells break down the stored glycogen into glucose to use as energy.\nTypes of diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus.\nType 1 diabetes Mellitus happens when the part of the pancreas that makes insulin is destroyed by that person\u2019s own immune system. When the pancreas does not make insulin, glucose \u2013 sugar \u2013 in the blood cannot get into the parts of the body that need sugar to live. In order to live, a person with type 1 diabetes must take insulin for the rest of their life. They need to check their blood sugar level on a regular basis, often, many times each day.\nType 1 diabetes happens most of the time in younger people, however, it can occur in adults, although this is much less common. About 1 out of every 10 people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\nType 2 diabetes Mellitus is an illness very different from type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the person makes insulin, but either the insulin does not work in that person\u2019s body as it should, or they do not make enough insulin to process the glucose. When insulin does not work as it should, glucose (sugar) in the blood cannot get into the parts of the body that need sugar. \nGestational diabetes.\nGestational diabetes mellitus is like type 2 diabetes. It happens to some women when they are pregnant.\nOther types of diabetes.\nOther types of diabetes include but are not limited to:\nType 2 diabetes happens most of the time in an older person who is overweight.\nThe onset of symptoms in type 1 diabetes usually happens suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, there may be mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Making it much harder to detect.\nComplications of diabetes.\nComplications are problems that happen because of a disease. In the case of diabetes, there are two kinds of complications. The first kind happens quickly and can be dealt with quickly. This kind is called an \"acute complication\". The other kind is caused by the blood glucose being too high for many years, and is called a \"chronic complication\" or \"long-term complication\".\nExcess blood glucose is called 'hyperglycemia'. If very high, it can cause acute complications. In type 1 diabetics, one of these complications is \"diabetic ketoacidosis\" which is a medical emergency and can often be detected by a fruity smell on the breath. Another acute complication, more common in type 2 diabetics, is \"non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma\" which is also very dangerous. \nToo low blood glucose is called \"hypoglycemia\". It can also cause acute complications. If too low, diabetics can have many symptoms such as sweating, trembling, anger (or feeling passive), and possibly even passing out. Diabetics with hypoglycemia may be confused or even unconscious. They may appear to have drunk too much alcohol. Severe hypoglycemia is very dangerous and can cause death. The best treatment of hypoglycemia is avoiding it. If it happens, eating food containing glucose (for example, table sugar) usually improves the condition quickly. Sometimes it is treated by giving an injection of a medicine called 'glucagon'. Glucagon is a hormone made by the pancreas. It has the opposite effect of insulin. Administering glucagon will cause the blood glucose level to rise by forcing stored glucose into the blood. Hypoglycemia is usually caused by too much diabetic medication, insufficient food, too much exercise, or a combination of these. \nChronic complications are mostly caused by hyperglycemia (but not high enough to always cause acute complications). It causes damage to blood vessels and nerves. Damage to blood vessels can eventually cause strokes, heart attacks, kidney failure, blindness, slow healing of skin breaks - with the added possibility of infection - and even amputations from poor circulation (decreased blood flow, usually to the feet and toes). Damage to nerves can make diabetics not feel pain (this usually happens in their feet). This causes them to have more injuries and not realize they have hurt themselves. Damage to nerves can also cause pain even when there's no real injury. It's a type of \"phantom pain\" or \"ghost pain\". The pain can be so intense that strong pain medication may be required.\nMonitoring of diabetes.\nBecause of the damage caused by high blood glucose, it is important to treat diabetes mellitus. The goal is to maintain a normal blood glucose level. The normal range for blood glucose is 80-120 mg/dL (milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood) or 3.5-7 mmol/l (millimole per liter of blood). These are different ways of saying the same thing, much like yards and meters are different units of distance measurement.\nDiabetics should check their blood glucose often. This is to make sure they do not get hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. A glucometer is a battery-powered measuring device that checks the blood glucose level. Diabetics often carry a glucometer with them and check their blood sugar level several times a day. They may also suffer severe constipation and frequent urination. \nDoctors may also use a blood test called a \"hemoglobin A1C\". This is sometimes written Hgb-A1C or other ways; there's no standard name. This tells the doctor what the average blood glucose has been for about the past 90 days. If the level has been too high, it may indicate new medication, different medication dosages, or a better diet may be needed.\nDiabetics must be monitored for signs of complications due to diabetes. They should see an eye doctor regularly to be checked for damage to the blood vessels in the eyes. If this is not found and treated early, it can cause blindness. They should have their urine or blood checked regularly for signs of kidney damage. They must check their feet for cuts, bruises, blisters, and so on at least every day. And they should have their feet checked regularly for nerve damage, circulation problems, and infections.\nTreatment of diabetes.\nThe most important goal in diabetes is to keep the blood glucose level as close to normal as possible. Taking care of your Diabetes levels requires awareness. You should be aware of the status of your blood sugar like when there is a rise or a fall. Since it usually goes up after eating, and down after exercise, coping with it sensibly is often complex, and usually takes care and thought. Treatment differs between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin. People with type 2 usually begin with diet, exercise, and weight loss, perhaps moving to medication (and, though not as common, insulin).\nEducation is important for both types of diabetes. Diabetics must learn about diet. They learn how to estimate and keep track of how much carbohydrate, protein, and fat are in different foods. They plan their meals to have the right amount of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Patients with type 1 may decide how much insulin to take before a meal based on how much they will eat.\nDiabetics must also be careful about exercise. Exercise is important to stay healthy, but intense or extended periods of exercise can cause hypoglycemia. As a result, diabetics must plan exercise carefully.\nIn addition to controlling blood glucose levels, other treatments may be needed. Diabetics often have blood vessel diseases, so it is important to pay attention to other diseases that may affect blood vessels. In people with diabetes, treating high blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol is more important than usual. Both of these diseases damage blood vessels. The treatment goals can change for diabetics. For instance, in people without diabetes, blood pressure should be 140/90 or less. In diabetics, it should be 130/80 or less."}

{"id": "12983", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12983", "title": "Victor Hugo", "text": "Victor Marie Hugo (26 February 1802 \u2013 22 May 1885) was a French poet, playwright, novelist, statesman and human rights activist. He played an important part in the Romantic movement in France.\nHugo first became famous in France because of his poetry, as well as his novels and his plays. \"Les Contemplations\" and \"La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles\" are his most famous poetry collections. Outside of France, his novels \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" and \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" (known in English also as \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\") are his most famous works.\nWhen he was young, he was a conservative royalist. As he got older he became more liberal and supported republicanism. His work was about many of the political and social problems as well as the artistic trends of his time. He is buried in the Panth\u00e9on, in Paris.\nLife.\nVictor Hugo was the son of Joseph L\u00e9opold Sigisbert Hugo (1773\u20131828) and Sophie Tr\u00e9buchet (1772-1821). He had two older brothers called Abel Joseph Hugo (1798\u20131855) and Eug\u00e8ne Hugo (1800\u20131837). He was born in 1802, in Besan\u00e7on (in the Doubs department). Hugo lived in France for most of his life. During the reign of Napoleon III he went into exile. In 1851, he lived in Belgium, in Brussels.He moved to Jersey in 1852. He stayed there until 1855 when he went to live in Guernsey until 1870. He lived there again in 1872-1873. From 1859, his exile was by choice.\nSome great events marked Hugo's early childhood. A few years before his birth, the Bourbon Dynasty was overthrown during the French Revolution. The First Republic rose and fell and the First French Empire rose under the rule of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte. Napol\u00e9on became Emperor two years after Hugo's birth. The Bourbon Monarchy was restored when Hugo was 17. His parents had different political and religious views. Hugo's father was an officer. He ranked very high in Napol\u00e9on's army. He was an atheist republican and considered Napol\u00e9on a hero. His mother was an extreme Catholic Royalist. As Hugo's father was an officer, the family moved frequently. Victor Hugo learned a lot from these travels. He stayed in Naples and Rome for six months, before going back to Paris. He was only five at the time, but he remembered the trip well.\nHis mother, Sophie, went to Italy with her husband who was a governor of a province near Naples. They also went to Spain where Joseph governed three Spanish provinces. Sophie separated temporarily from her husband in 1803, as it was a difficult life. She settled in Paris. This meant she dominated Hugo's education. Therefore, Hugo's early work, mainly in poetry, show him praising monarchism and faith. The 1848 Revolution made Hugo rebel against his Catholic Royalist education. After that revolution, he preferred republicanism and freethought.\nWhen he was young, Victor Hugo fell in love. He became secretly engaged to his childhood friend Ad\u00e8le Foucher (1803-1868), against his mother's wishes.\nHe married Ad\u00e8le in 1822, after his mother's death in 1821. Their first child, L\u00e9opold (born in 1823), died in infancy. Hugo had four other children called L\u00e9opoldine (28 August 1824), Charles (4 November 1826), Fran\u00e7ois-Victor (28 October 1828) and Ad\u00e8le (24 August 1830). Hugo published his first novel in 1823 (\"Han d'Islande\"). His second came three years later (\"Bug-Jargal\", 1826). He published five more volumes of poetry (\"Les Orientales\", 1829; \"Les Feuilles d'automne\", 1831; \"Les Chants du cr\u00e9puscule\", 1835; \"Les Voix int\u00e9rieures\", 1837; and \"Les Rayons et les ombres\", 1840) between 1829 and 1840. This helped his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time.\nThe death of his oldest and favourite daughter, L\u00e9opoldine, made Hugo very sad. She died at the age of 19, in 1843. This was only shortly after her marriage. She drowned in the Seine at Villequier. Her heavy skirts pulled her down, when a boat overturned. Her husband died as he tried to save her. At the time; Victor Hugo was travelling with his mistress in the south of France. He learned about L\u00e9opoldine's death from a newspaper when he was sitting in a caf\u00e9. He describes his shock and grief in his poem \"\u00c0 Villequier\":\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"H\u00e9las ! vers le pass\u00e9 tournant un oeil d'envie,\"\n\"Sans que rien ici-bas puisse m'en consoler,\"\n\"Je regarde toujours ce moment de ma vie\"\n\"O\u00f9 je l'ai vue ouvrir son aile et s'envoler !\"\n\"Je verrai cet instant jusqu'\u00e0 ce que je meure,\"\n\"L'instant, pleurs superflus !\"\n\"O\u00f9 je criai : L'enfant que j'avais tout \u00e0 l'heure,\"\n\"Quoi donc ! je ne l'ai plus !\"\nAlas! turning an envious eye towards the past,\nunconsolable by anything on earth,\nI keep looking at that moment of my life\nwhen I saw her open her wings and fly away!\nI will see that instant until I die,\nthat instant\u2014too much for tears!\nwhen I cried out: \"The child that I had just now--\nwhat! I don't have her any more!\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nAfter this, he wrote many poems about his daughter's life and death. One of his most famous poem is probably \"Demain, d\u00e8s l'aube\". In this poem, he describes visiting her grave.\nWritings.\nFran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, the famous Romantic writer, influenced Hugo during the early 1800s. When Hugo was young, he said he would be \"Chateaubriand ou rien\" (\u201cChateaubriand or nothing\u201d). Many things Chateaubriand did, Hugo copied. First, he defended the cause of Romanticism. Then, he became involved in politics and supported Republicanism. Finally, he was forced into exile because of his political views. Hugo's passion and eloquence in his early work made him successful and famous at an early age. His first collection of poetry (\"Odes et po\u00e9sies diverses\") was published in 1822. At the time, Hugo was only twenty years old. It earned him a \"royal pension\" (money from the king) from Louis XVIII. His poems were admired but it was his next collection, four years later in 1826 (\"Odes et Ballades\") which revealed Hugo to be a great poet.\nVictor Hugo's first mature work of fiction appeared in 1829. It reflected his interest for society which appeared more often in his later work. \"Le Dernier jour d'un condamn\u00e9\" (\"The Last Day of a Condemned Man\") had a big influence on later writers such as Albert Camus, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. \"Claude Gueux\" appeared in 1834. It is a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France. Hugo himself considered it to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\". But Hugo\u2019s first successful novel \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" (\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\"), which was published in 1831. It was quickly translated into other languages across Europe. One of the effects of the novel was to make the inhabitants of Paris restore the neglected Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel. The book also inspired a renewed appreciation for pre-renaissance buildings, which began to be actively preserved.\nHugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s, but it would take a full 17 years for \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\", to be realized and finally published in 1862. The author was acutely aware of the quality of the novel and publication of the work went to the highest bidder. The Belgian publishing house Lacroix and Verboeckhoven undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch. It also initially published only the first part of the novel (\u201cFantine\u201d), which was launched simultaneously in major cities. Installments of the book sold out within hours, and had enormous impact on French society. The critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel; Taine found it insincere, Barbey d'Aurevilly complained of its vulgarity, Flaubert found within it \"neither truth nor greatness,\" the Goncourts lambasted its artificiality, and Baudelaire - despite giving favorable reviews in newspapers - castigated it in private as \"tasteless and inept.\" \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the French National Assembly. Today the novel remains his most enduringly popular work. It is popular worldwide, has been adapted for cinema, television and stage shows.\nThe shortest correspondence in history is between Hugo and his publisher Hurst &amp; Blackett in 1862. It is said Hugo was on vacation when Les Mis\u00e9rables (which is over 1200 pages) was published. He telegraphed the single-character message '?' to his publisher, who replied with a single '!'.\nHugo turned away from social or political issues in his next novel, \"Les Travailleurs de la Mer\" (\"Toilers of the Sea\"), published in 1866. Still, the book was well received, perhaps due to the earlier success of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\". Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey, where he spent fifteen years of exile, Hugo\u2019s story about Man\u2019s battle with the sea and the creatures in its depths, started an unusual trend in Paris: squids. From squid dishes and exhibitions, to squid hats and parties, Parisians became fascinated by these unusual sea creatures.\nHugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel, \"L'Homme Qui Rit\" (\"The Man Who Laughs\"), which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy. However, the novel was not as successful as his previous efforts, and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as Flaubert and \u00c9mile Zola, whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work. His last novel, \"Quatre-vingt-treize\" (\"Ninety-Three\"), published in 1874, was about a subject that Hugo had previously avoided: the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution.\nPolitical life and exile.\nAfter three unsuccessful attempts, Hugo was finally elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1841, confirming his position in the world of French arts and letters. A group of French scholars, particularly Etienne de Jouy, were fighting against the \"romantic evolution\" and had managed to delay Victor Hugo's election. After that he became increasingly involved in French politics. He was raised to the peerage by King Louis-Philippe in 1841 and entered the Higher Chamber as a \"pair de France\", where he spoke against the death penalty and social injustice, and in favour of freedom of the press and self-government for Poland. However, he was also becoming more supportive of the Republican form of government and, following the 1848 Revolution and the formation of the Second Republic, was elected to the Constitutional Assembly and the Legislative Assembly.\nWhen Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) grabbed complete power in 1851, establishing an anti-parliamentary constitution, Hugo openly declared him a traitor to France. He relocated to Brussels, then Jersey, and finally settled with his family on the channel island of Guernsey at Hauteville House, where he would live in exile until 1870.\nWhile in exile, Hugo published his famous political pamphlets against Napoleon III, \"Napol\u00e9on le Petit\" and \"Histoire d'un crime\". The pamphlets were banned in France, but nonetheless had a strong impact there. He also composed or published some of his best work during his period in Guernsey, including \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\", and three widely praised collections of poetry (\"Les Ch\u00e2timents\", 1853; \"Les Contemplations\", 1856; and \"La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles\", 1859).\nHe convinced the government of Queen Victoria to spare the lives of six Irish people convicted of terrorist activities and his influence was credited in the removal of the death penalty from the constitutions of Geneva, Portugal and Colombia. He had also pleaded for Benito Juarez to spare the recently captured emperor Maximilian I of Mexico but to no avail.\nAlthough Napoleon III granted an amnesty to all political exiles in 1859, Hugo declined, as it meant he would have to curtail his criticisms of the government. It was only after Napoleon III fell from power and the Third Republic was proclaimed that Hugo finally returned to his homeland in 1870, where he was promptly elected to the National Assembly and the Senate.\nHe was in Paris during the siege by the Prussian army in 1870, famously eating animals given to him by the Paris zoo. As the siege continued, and food became ever more scarce, he wrote in his diary that he was reduced to \"eating the unknown\".\nBecause of his concern for the rights of artists and copyright, he was a founding member of the Association Litt\u00e9raire et Artistique Internationale, which led to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.\nReligious views.\nHugo's religious views changed radically over the course of his life. In his youth, he called himself as a Catholic and professed respect for Church hierarchy and authority. From there he became a non-practicing Catholic, and increasingly expressed anti-catholic views. He had a casual interest in Spiritualism during his exile (where he participated also in seances), and in later years settled into a Rationalist Deism similar to that espoused by Voltaire. A census-taker asked Hugo in 1872 if he was a Catholic, and he replied, \"No. A Freethinker\".\nHugo never lost his antipathy towards the Roman Catholic Church, due largely to what he saw as the Church's indifference to the plight of the working class under the oppression of the monarchy; and perhaps also due to the frequency with which Hugo's work appeared on the Pope's list of \"proscribed books\" (Hugo counted 740 attacks on \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" in the Catholic press). On the deaths of his sons Charles and Fran\u00e7ois-Victor, he insisted that they be buried without crucifix or priest, and in his will made the same stipulation about his own death and funeral. However, although Hugo believed Catholic dogma to be outdated and dying, he never directly attacked the institution itself.\nHugo's Rationalism can be found in poems such as \"Torquemada\" (1869, about religious fanaticism), \"The Pope\" (1878, anti-clerical), \"Religions and Religion\" (1880, denying the usefulness of churches) and, published posthumously, \"The End of Satan\" and \"God\" (1886 and 1891 respectively, in which he represents Christianity as a griffin and Rationalism as an angel).\nVictor Hugo and music.\nAlthough Hugo's many talents did not include exceptional musical ability, he nevertheless had a great impact on the music world through the endless inspiration that his works provided for composers of the 19th and 20th century. Hugo himself particularly enjoyed the music of Gluck and Weber and greatly admired Beethoven, and rather unusually for his time, he also appreciated works by composers from earlier centuries such as Palestrina and Monteverdi. Two famous musicians of the 19th century were friends of Hugo: Berlioz and Liszt. The latter played Beethoven in Hugo\u2019s home, and Hugo joked in a letter to a friend that thanks to Liszt\u2019s piano lessons, he learned how to play a favourite song on the piano \u2013 even though only with one finger! Hugo also worked with composer Louise Bertin, writing the libretto for her 1836 opera \"La Esmeralda\" which was based on the character in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". Although for various reasons the opera closed soon after its fifth performance and is little known today, it has been recently enjoying a revival, both in a piano/song concert version by Liszt at the Festival international Victor Hugo et \u00c9gaux 2007 and in a full orchestral version to be presented in July 2008 at Le Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon.\nWell over one thousand musical compositions have been inspired by Hugo\u2019s works from the 1800s until the present day. In particular, Hugo\u2019s plays, in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama, attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas. More than one hundred operas are based on Hugo\u2019s works and among them are Donizetti\u2019s \"Lucrezia Borgia\" (1833), Verdi\u2019s \"Rigoletto\" (1851) and Ernani (1844), and Ponchielli\u2019s \"La Gioconda\" (1876). Hugo\u2019s novels as well as his plays have been a great source of inspiration for musicians, stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre such as Notre-Dame de Paris and the ever-popular Les Mis\u00e9rables, London West End\u2019s longest running musical. Additionally, Hugo\u2019s beautiful poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians, and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as Berlioz, Bizet, Faur\u00e9, Franck, Lalo, Liszt, Massenet, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Rachmaninov and Wagner.\nToday, Hugo\u2019s work continues to stimulate musicians to create new compositions. For example, Hugo\u2019s novel against capital punishment, The Last Day of a Condemned Man, has recently been adapted into an opera by David Alagna (libretto by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rico Alagna). Their brother, tenor Roberto Alagna, performed in the opera\u2019s premiere in Paris in the summer of 2007 and again in February 2008 in Valencia with Erwin Schrott as part of the Festival international Victor Hugo et \u00c9gaux 2008. In Guernsey, every two years the Victor Hugo International Music Festival attracts a wide range of musicians and the premiere of songs specially commissioned from Guillaume Connesson and based on Hugo\u2019s poetry.\nDeclining years and death.\nWhen Hugo returned to Paris in 1870, the country hailed him as a national hero. Despite his popularity Hugo lost his bid for reelection to the National Assembly in 1872. Within a brief period, he suffered a mild stroke, his daughter Ad\u00e8le\u2019s internment in an insane asylum, and the death of his two sons. (Ad\u00e8le's biography inspired the movie \"The Story of Adele H.\") His wife Ad\u00e8le had died in 1868. His faithful mistress, Juliette Drouet, died in 1883, only two years before his own death. Despite his personal loss, Hugo remained committed to the cause of political change. On 30 January 1876 Hugo was elected to the newly created Senate. The last phase of his political career is considered a failure. Hugo took on the role of a maverick and got little done in the Senate.\nIn February 1881 Hugo celebrated his 79th birthday. To honor the fact that he was entering his eightieth year, one of the greatest tributes to a living writer was held. The celebrations began on the 25th when Hugo was presented with a S\u00e8vres vase, the traditional gift for sovereigns. On the 27th one of the largest parades in French history was held. Marchers stretched from Avenue d'Eylau, down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and all the way to the center of Paris. The paraders marched for six hours to pass Hugo as he sat in the window at his house. Every inch and detail of the event was for Hugo; the official guides even wore cornflowers as an allusion to Cosette's song in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables.\"\nHugo died on 22 May 1885 in Paris, France from an infection, aged 83. His death generated intense national mourning. He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature, he was a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France. More than two million people joined his funeral procession in Paris from the Arc de Triomphe to the Panth\u00e9on, where he was buried. He shares a crypt within the Panth\u00e9on with Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re and \u00c9mile Zola. Most large French towns and cities have a street named for him. The avenue where he died, in Paris, now bears his name.\nDrawings.\nMany are not aware that Hugo was almost as prolific in the visual arts as he was in literature, producing more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime. Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile, when he made the decision to stop writing in order to devote himself to politics. Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet during the period 1848-1851.\nHugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black pen-and-ink wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with color. The surviving drawings are surprisingly accomplished and \"modern\" in their style and execution, foreshadowing the experimental techniques of Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism.\nHe would not hesitate to use his children's stencils, ink blots, puddles and stains, lace impressions, \"pliage\" or folding (i.e. Rorschach blots), \"grattage\" or rubbing, often using the charcoal from match sticks or his fingers instead of pen or brush. Sometimes he would even toss in coffee or soot to get the effects he wanted. It is reported that Hugo often drew with his left hand or without looking at the page, or during Spiritualist s\u00e9ances, in order to access his unconscious mind, a concept only later popularized by Sigmund Freud.\nHugo kept his artwork out of the public eye, fearing it would overshadow his literary work. However, he enjoyed sharing his drawings with his family and friends, often in the form of ornately handmade calling cards, many of which were given as gifts to visitors when he was in political exile. Some of his work was shown to, and appreciated by, contemporary artists such as Van Gogh and Delacroix; the latter expressed the opinion that if Hugo had decided to become a painter instead of a writer, he would have outshone the artists of their century.\nGallery:\nMemorials.\nThe people of Guernsey built a statue in Candie Gardens (St. Peter Port) to commemorate his stay in the islands. The City of Paris has preserved his residences Hauteville House, Guernsey and 6, Place des Vosges as museums. The house where he stayed in Vianden, Luxembourg, in 1871 has also become a museum.\nHugo is venerated as a saint in the Vietnamese religion of Cao Dai.\nThe Avenue Victor-Hugo in the XVI\u00e8me arrondissement of Paris bears Hugo's name, and links the Place de l'\u00c9toile to the vicinity of the Bois de Boulogne by way of the Place Victor-Hugo. This square is served by a Paris M\u00e9tro stop also named in his honor. A number of streets and avenues throughout France are likewise named after him. The school Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo was founded in his town of birth, Besan\u00e7on in France. Avenue Victor-Hugo, in Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada, was named to honor him.\nIn the city of Avellino, Italy, Victor Hugo briefly stayed in what is now known as Il Palazzo Culturale, when reuniting with his father, Leopold Sigisbert Hugo, in 1808. Victor would later write about his brief stay here quoting \"C\u2019\u00e9tait un palais de marbre...\". In the city of Edinburgh, Scotland there is a delicatessen named Victor Hugo Delicatessen, it was originally run by a French couple but was purchased in 2005. The shop is on Melville Terrace, over looking the meadows and next to University of Edinburgh halls of residence, Sciennes.\nWorks.\nPublished during Hugo's lifetime.\nPoems of Victor Hugo"}

Before 1998, only 24 teams were in the finals; starting in 2026, there will be 48 teams in the finals. Many years before each World Cup, FIFA picks the host nation, the country where the finals will be held.

It was formed in 1990 in Los Angeles, California. The band took a break before and after their third album \"Lateralus\" because singer Maynard James Keenan was working with his other band, A Perfect Circle, at the same time. The band has won Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance in 1997 for the song \"\u00c6nema\" and in 2001 for the song \"Schism\". Tool has four members in the band: Danny Carey, Justin Chancellor, Adam Jones, and Maynard James Keenan.\nTool has released five full studio albums. Their first release, \"Opiate\", which had only seven songs on it, is an EP and the album \"Salival\" is a recording of live performances. The band released their fourth album, \"10,000 Days\", on May 2, 2006, and their fifth and most recent album \"Fear Inoculum\" on August 30, 2019.\nHistory.\nTool started in 1991 when Keenan and guitarist Jones started practicing together. Tom Morello introduced them to drummer Danny Carey, who lived in the building where they practiced, and he soon joined as well. Bass guitar player Paul D'Amour was the last to join the band. D'Amour left the band in 1995 to work with other bands. Justin Chancellor was hired to replace him.\nOpiate.\nTool made its first album in 1992. It was called \"Opiate\" EP. To help sell records, they went on tour. They traveled around the U.S. playing in concerts with two other bands named Fishbone and Rage Against the Machine. During one of their concerts in 1993, the band was playing at the Church of Scientology's Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles. Keenan (who would later write the lyrics \"Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones\"), baa-ed like a sheep for a lot of the show. Maynard is a GOD. \nThe album did not sell many copies at first. After Tool got more popular, more fans bought \"Opiate\". It took 13 years for the album to be certified platinum by the RIAA. That means the album sold one million copies.\nUndertow.\nTool's first studio album came out in 1993. It was called Undertow. In 1994, the band released a song, titled \"Prison Sex\", from the album. With it was a music video that was created and directed by Jones. The video was deemed \"too graphic and offensive\", and was only played on MTV a few times because the video dealt with child abuse.\nThe album reached #50 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and #1 on the Top Heatseekers. It was certified gold by the RIAA after only eight months, and platinum less than a year later.\n\u00c6nima.\nIn October 1996, the band released their second studio album, called \u00c6nima. Tool began a long legal fight with their label Volcano Records (formerly Zoo Records) over problems with their contract. They ended up with a new contract that said they would make three more albums. The members of Tool decided to take some time away after that.\nThe album was certified gold in 10 weeks and achieved double platinum, which means it sold two million copies, in 10 months. In 1998, \"\u00c6nema\" won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.\nFear Inoculum\nJanuary 26, 2020, Tool has won Best Metal Performance at the 62nd GRAMMY Awards for (\"7empest.\") Band members Justin Chancellor and Danny Carey were present to accept the award.\nStyle.\nSinger Maynard James Keenan has a unique, melodic style of singing. This style is thought to have influenced many other bands. While guitarist Adam Jones's style of playing is very simple, he is known for his use of different techniques of playing together, and for trying new things with his instrument. Danny Carey has a very technical, advanced style of drumming. He is known for using odd time signatures, among other things. Justin Chancellor has an aggressive style of picking and fingering, using many guitar techniques which include using a pick, chords, harmonics, effects, and hammer ons and pull offs."}

Their last show took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on December 31, 2015.\nHistory.\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was formed at the start of 1981 by bass player Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee. After auditions they found singer Vince Neil in a club and guitar player Mick Mars through an ad in a paper. They released their first album Too Fast For Love in 1981, and later got signed to a major label. The band built success over the next few years with their next three albums, Shout at the Devil, Theatre of Pain and Girls, Girls, Girls, which had hit songs like \"Shout at the Devil\" \"Home Sweet Home\" and \"Girls, Girls, Girls\". However, the band created some negative attention because of their use of illegal drugs, large amounts of sex with women, and appearances, including make-up and several tattoos. Nikki Sixx took an overdose of heroin in 1987 and was legally dead for two minutes before getting an adrenaline shot, making him conscious again. The band stopped their drugs and drinking shortly after and released their most popular album, Dr. Feelgood in 1989.\nThey released a greatest hits album in 1991 so fans had something to listen to before they brought out a sixth album. However, the band started arguing and Vince Neil was out of the band in 1992 as a result. So, the band found a new singer called John Corabi, who also played guitar and wrote lyrics with the band. They released their self-titled album in 1994. It created a mixed response from fans who preferred Vince Neil as the band's singer, and did not like the music itself, which sounded less like glam rock and more like hard rock. John Corabi left in 1996 and Vince Neil came back. The band released Generation Swine in 1997, but created a mixed response due to the musical experiments on the album.\nTommy Lee was unhappy with Vince Neil back in the band and further arguments between band members caused Lee to leave the band, being replaced by Randy Castillo. The band released their least successful album, New Tattoo, in 2000. It sounded more like the band's 80s albums rather than the more experimental albums they released in the 90s. After the album, Randy Castillo became ill and Samantha Maloney had to drum during some of the band's concerts. Randy Castillo died in 2002 and the band did not do much for the next two years.\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce made a comeback with Tommy Lee in 2004, and were once again successful, touring worldwide and releasing another greatest hits album called Red, White and Crue. They released another album of new songs in 2008 called Saints of Los Angeles. They disbanded after their last show on December 31, 2015."}

It is often used for making models of cars, boats, helicopters and airplanes move on their own like real ones. For controlling models, an operator uses a transmitter that has the model's controls on it. When a control is moved, the radio signal changes. The part on the model that takes the changing signals and helps turn them into movement is called the receiver. The receiver then tells a special kind of motor called a servo to move part of the model. \nOn a car or boat, a servo is usually used for steering. Model sailboats use a servo to adjust the sail as well as the rudder, or steering device. On airplanes and helicopters, servos are used not only for steering but for up and down pitch. If the model uses an engine to make it run, a servo is used to control the speed of the engine. A model which operates with an electric motor usually has something called an electronic speed control or \"ESC\" to control its speed. \nRadio control was once used by the military to control large weapons.

{"id": "13146", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13146", "title": "Samurai", "text": "The samurai (or bushi) were Japanese warriors. They were members of the important military class before Japanese society changed in 1868. The samurai were also considered as a type of hereditary nobility as well.\nThe word \"samurai\" comes from the Japanese verb \"saburau\", which means \"to serve someone and look up to them\".\nHistory of Samurai.\nIn the 12th century, two military clans, the Minamoto and the Taira, were very powerful. They controlled Japan. They fought wars against each other. In 1192, Minamoto no Yoritomo became the first shogun. He became the ruler of all of Japan. He started a new government in Kamakura. This \u201cKamakura\u201d government was from 1185-1333. It made the samurai the ruling class of Japanese society.\nThe samurai did many wars in the Warring States period (1467-1573). At that time, there were many independent areas in Japan. Those areas fought each other all the time, so Japan needed many samurai. Many of the famous samurai movies by Akira Kurosawa were about this time. \nToyotomi Hideyoshi won many wars against other clans. When he made Japan one country, he developed a social caste system. This caste system was completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and the rulers after him. Between the wars, many samurai had always worked on farms. Hideyoshi said that all samurai must either live on farms or live in castle towns with other warriors. Hideyoshi also made a law that only samurai could have swords.\nThe samurai became very powerful and important near the end of the Edo period (1603-1867) and in the Shinto period. In the Edo period, they were the most important social caste. All samurai had to live in castle towns. The samurais' lords paid them with rice. Some samurai did not have lords. These samurai were called \"R\u014dnin\". The \"R\u014dnin\" caused some problems for Japan in the early Edo period.\nIn 1615, Tokugawa won a very important battle when he took Osaka Castle. The Tokugawa clan did not have any more rivals. Japan became very peaceful for about 250 years. In these 250 years, military skills became less important. Most samurai became bureaucrats, teachers or artists.\nIn 1868, feudalism ended in Japan. This was the end of the samurai class.\nWeapons.\nWeapons used by the samurai included:\nBeliefs in people.\nA samurai believed that his swords held his soul. That made the sword the most important thing he had.\nSamurai were allowed to fight anyone who did not show them proper respect. Every sword had to be tested. To do this, the owner of the sword could execute a criminal. This allowed the warrior to test his sword's sharpness. Samurai led their lives according to the ethical code of \"bushido\" (\"the way of the warrior\"). That meant loyalty to one's master, self-discipline and respectful, ethical behaviour. When a samurai lost his master, also called \"daimyo\", he became a \"Ronin\". \nIf a samurai were defeated or he dishonored himself by not following the code of \"bushido\", he had to commit \"seppuku\" (ritual suicide). Part of the \"seppuku\" ritual is cutting the stomach or abdomen. That part of the ritual is called \"hara-kiri\". To a samurai, death was better than having no honour or being captured by the enemy. Another reason to commit \"Seppuku\" was the death of the daimyo. With this ritual, a samurai was able to show how loyal he was to his dead master. There were periods when \"Seppuku\" was forbidden, but some samurai still committed it.\nThe bushi's training methods, like meditation, judo and kendo, are still followed today. There is no longer a samurai class in modern Japan, but the successors of these families are well-respected.\nWomen.\nSamurai women were trained to defend themselves and their children. They usually did this when their warrior husbands were busy in battles. This is why samurai women were trained to handle polearms (naginata) and short daggers (tanto). During the Edo period, Japanese women were trained to handle naginata by the age of 18. The short kaiken knife was used by young women to defend their virtue or, if they lost it, to take their own life.\nDuring the Edo period, women's education became very important. Girls were taught to write, read, dance, etc. beginning at a young age. While the main criteria for marriage changed, among the most important were physical attractiveness and education. Special books were written for women. They mainly taught how to take care of house and children. By the end of the Edo period, women attended philosophical and literary classes.\nThe term \"samurai\" refers to males specifically. There were a few women who were samurai. One of the most famous was Itagaki. She lived during the end of the Heian period. She owned her own army of about 3,000 warriors. In 1199, Itagaki fought against 10,000 Heike soldiers. She was famous for being very good at handling the naginata sword. \nHino Tomiko ruled in place of her husband, Ashikaga Yoshimasa (8th shogun).\nToyotomi Hideyoshi's mistress became the master of Osaka Castle after his death.\nYamauchi Kazutoyo's wife, Chiyo, was one of the most loyal wives known in Japanese history. She supported her husband during hard times, saving to buy a horse for him. Yamauchi Kazutoyo never took a mistress, though it was a known tradition for samurai. He never left Chiyo, even though she had only one child."}

Together with ethics, it is part of axiology which is the philosophy of what people like. Aesthetic philosophers ask what people like to see, hear, feel, smell or taste, and why they like these things. Aesthetic philosophers also ask if art has any value. For example, they may ask if some art that nobody likes and that nobody wants is art at all or if it is something else. Plato, Aristotle, and Immanuel Kant are some important philosophers of aesthetics.\nSubjectivism.\nOne theory in aesthetics is called subjectivism. Subjectivism says that each person has a sense of beauty. So, the only way of judging something's beauty is if people say it is beautiful. A common way of describing this is \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\". Subjectivism also says, for the same reason, that something is art simply because someone says it is art. This is backed up by the experience. Even though people feel that something is beautiful, they may not be able to explain why.\nObjectivism.\nMany objectivist theories of beauty have been offered, going from the ancient ideas of Plato and Aristotle (e.g., the golden mean,) which still have great appeal in their way to neuroscience research into the brain's response to images and other sensitive information. At the moment, even though we do not know what people are thinking, brain-scan technology can identify when people are responding pleasurably to images, providing some clue as to how certain images affect some people."}

It is one of the most used kinds of internal combustion engine.\nMost other engines need a system called an ignition system \u2013 one that uses an electric spark \u2013 in order to burn the mix of fuel and air and make power. Other types of ignition systems use compressed air from an outside source, such as an air compressor. A diesel does not. It burns a diesel fuel (similar to heating oil) through very high compression or pressing together of the mix. A tiny bit of fuel is injected, or forced, into the engine's cylinders at just the right moment. Since gases heat when they are pressed together, the compression of the air and fuel mix cause the mix to explode within the cylinder. \nDiesel engines make very good use of the fuel they burn. They also make lots of torque (pronounced \"tork\"), or twisting power. An engine with a lot of torque will be able to spin its shaft even if it is very hard to do so. This makes a diesel engine a good choice in heavy equipment like trucks, trains and construction machines. The very big trucks on the road have diesel engines in them. So do train locomotives, unless they are electric or the old steam-powered kind. \nSometimes, even the torque of a diesel engine is not enough to run such big machines. To boost power, large diesels often have a device called a turbocharger attached. A turbocharger is a type of turbine \u2013 something used to move a lot of air very quickly. Jet engines also contain a turbine. In the diesel, pressure from the exhaust spins the turbocharger at a very high speed. Fresh air is then forced back into the engine. Since the engine works by pumping air, the more air you can put through it, the more power it makes. That is where the turbocharger helps. A diesel engine that has a turbocharger is called a turbodiesel. The whistling sound sometimes heard near one of these engines is caused by the turbocharger, or \"turbo\" for short. \nA diesel engine can also be made to run on canola oil made from old cooking oil. This type of fuel is called biodiesel. Running a diesel engine on biodiesel fuel makes the exhaust smell like food. Vegetable oil as fuel is not a new idea. The engine that Rudolf Diesel used to demonstrate his new idea ran on canola oil."}

Later in 1905, the new Bishop of Bergamo, Giacomo Maria Radini Tedeschi, appointed Angelo his secretary. Angelo went with Bishop Giacomo to all his pastoral visits. Angelo also helped him with many other tasks like managing the diocesan bulletin, going on pilgrimages, and social works. Angelo did more than just that while in the seminary; using his very good preaching skills he taught history, patrology and apologetics. It was in the seminary he met the two future saints that would affect his life dramatically. These two Saints were St. Charles Borromeo and St. Francis de Sales, who were both very good pastors in the same seminary, and had a kind of apprentice like relationship. Father Angelo was extremely devoted to Bishop Giacomo until his death in 1914. After Bishop Giacomo\u2019s death, Father Angelo continued teaching in the seminary, but was dragged into World War I and served as a medical corps sergeant and after the war started Italy\u2019s first home for poor young students. His life after the war started changing dramatically, and he even got the attention of Pope Pius XI.\nBishop.\nFrom 1925 to 1944, Roncalli was a papal representative in the Balkans and the Mideast. \nPope Pius XI named him Apostolic Visitator in Bulgaria, which brought him to the episcopate with the titular Diocese of Areopolis. He chose a motto, Oboedientia et Pax, which was his motto for the rest of his life.\nCardinal.\nRoncalli was Patriarch of Venice from 1953 to 1958. Venice is the see of a cardinal.\nPope.\nCardinal Roncalli was elected pope on October 29, 1958. His coronation was televised in Europe, and filmed for viewing in other parts of the world.\nPope John expanded the College of Cardinals by naming the first African Cardinal, the first Japanese Cardinal, the first Filipino Cardinal. and the first Venezuelan Cardinal. \nHe was the first Pope to make an official visit to the President of the Italian Republic at the Quirinal Palace. \nSecond Vatican Council.\nPope John brought together the church's bishops and cardinals in a meeting called Vatican Council II. It was ended by the Pope's death.\nAfter his death.\nJohn XXIII is buried with other popes in a crypt below St. Peter's Bascilica. According to the official news agency of the Soviet Union, the pope's reign \"was marked by fruitful activity for the sake of consolidating peace and peaceful cooperation among nations.\"\nOn September 3, 2000, Pope John XXIII was beatified and given the title of \"Blessed John XXIII\". On April 27, 2014, Pope John XXIII was canonized by Pope Francis and declared a new Saint of the Catholic Church given the title of \"Saint John XXIII\" alongside Pope John Paul II now known as \"Saint John Paul II\".\nOther websites.\n "}

{"id": "13183", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13183", "title": "Guitar", "text": "The guitar is a string instrument which is played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the headstock and the strings. Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic. Their strings are made of steel or nylon.\nThe guitar strings are plucked with the fingers and fingernails of the right hand (or left hand, for left handed players), or a small pick made of thin plastic. This type of pick is called a \"plectrum\" or guitar pick. The left hand holds the neck of the guitar while the fingers pluck the strings. Different finger positions on the fretboard make different notes.\nGuitar-like plucked string instruments have been used for many years. In many countries and at many different time periods, guitars and other plucked string instruments have been very popular, because they are light to carry from place to place, they are easier to learn to play than many other instruments. Guitars are used for many types of music, from Classical to Rock. Most pieces of popular music that have been written since the 1950s are written with guitars.\nThere are many different types of guitars, classified on how they are made and the type of music they are used for. All traditional types of guitar have a body which is hollow. This makes the sound of the strings louder, and gives the guitar its quality. This type of guitar is called \"acoustic\". (An \"acoustic\" instrument is one that makes its own dynamics.)\nFrom the 1930s, people started making and playing guitars that used electricity and amplifiers to control the loudness. These guitars, which are often used in popular music, are called \"electric guitars\". They do not need to have a hollow body. This is because they do not use acoustics to amplify the sound.\nMost guitars have six strings, but there are also guitars with four, seven, eight, ten, or twelve strings. More strings make the instrument sound fuller. The neck of a guitar has bars or marks called frets. Frets help a guitarist know where to put his or her fingers to get the right pitch when playing. Standard tuning defines the string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E, from lowest (low E2) to highest (high E4). Standard tuning is used by most guitarists, and frequently used tunings can be understood as variations on standard tuning.\nWord origin.\nThe word \"guitar\" was adopted into English from Spanish word \"guitarra\" in the 1600s. In the Middle Ages the word \"gitter\" or \"gittern\" was used in England. Both \"guitarra\" and \"gitter\" came from the Latin word \"cithara\". The word \"cithara\" came from the earlier Greek word \"kithara\". \"Kithara\" could have come from the Persian word \"seht\u0101r\". \"seh\" meaning \"three\" and \"t\u0101r\" meaning \"string\". There is also a similar but two-stringed Persian instrument named \"dot\u0101r\". \"do\" means \"two\" in Persian. The Indian sitar instrument was named after the Persian \"seht\u0101r\". The sihtar itself is related to the Indian instrument, the sitar.\nA person who plays a guitar is called a guitarist. A person who makes or fixes guitars is a \"luthier\", which comes from the word \"lute\". The word \"lute\", comes from the Arabic \"Al-Uud\", a stringed instrument from the Middle East.\nThe guitar appears to be derived from earlier instruments known in ancient central Asia as the Sitara. Instruments very similar to the guitar appear in ancient carvings and statues recovered from the old Iranian capitol of Susa. The modern word, guitar, was adopted into English from the Spanish word \"guitarra\", which came from the older Greek word kithara. Possible sources for various names of musical instruments that guitar could be derived from appear to be a combination of two Indo-European roots: guit-, similar to Sanskrit \"sangeet\" meaning \"music\", and \"-tar\" a widely found root meaning \"cord\" or \"string\".\nThe word \"guitar\" is a word that the Iberian Arabic language took from the Persian language. The word \"qitara\" is an Arabic name for various members of the lute family that preceded the Western guitar. The word \"guitarra\" was introduced into Spanish when such instruments were brought into Iberia by the Moors after the 10th century.\nHistory.\nThere have been instruments like the guitar for at least 5,000 years. The guitar may have come from older instruments known as the sitara from ancient India and central Asia. The oldest known picture of a guitar-like instrument is a 3300 year old stone carving of a Hittite bard. The oldest guitar-like instrument that is still complete is the \"Warwick Gittern\" in the British Museum. It belonged to Elizabeth I of England and probably to her father Henry VIII before it was given to her. It is about 500 years old.\nThe design of the modern guitar began with the Roman cithara. The cithara was brought by the Romans to Hispania (Spain) around 40 AD. In the 8th century the Moors brought the four-stringed oud into Spain. The introduction to the oud caused changes to the design of the cithara. In other parts of Europe, the six-string Scandinavian \"lut\" (lute) became popular wherever the Vikings had been. By 1200 AD, there were two types of the four string \"guitar\": the \"guitarra morisca\" (Moorish guitar) from Spain which had a rounded back, wide fingerboard and several soundholes, and the \"guitarra latina\" (Latin guitar) which was more like the modern guitar with one sound hole and a narrower neck.\nThe Spanish \"vihuela\", of the 16th century, was another instrument similar to the guitar. It had lute-style tuning and a body that was like a guitar. The vihuela was only popular for a short amount of time. It is not known whether it was simply a design that combined features of the oud and lute or a transition from the Renaissance instrument to the modern guitar.\nThe Vinaccia family from Naples, Italy were famous mandolin makers. It is thought that they also made the oldest six-string guitar that still exists. There is a guitar built that was signed and dated 1779 on the label by Gaetano Vinaccia (1759 - after 1831) Although there are many fakes that have dates on them from that time, this guitar is believed by experts to be genuine (real).\nThe guitar's design was improved (made better) by the famous Spanish luthier, Antonio Torres Jurado (1817-1892) and by Louis Panormo of London.\nThe electric guitar was made by George Beauchamp in 1936. Beauchamp co-founded a company called Rickenbacher to make guitars. However, Danelectro was the first to produce electric guitars for the public to use.\nDifferent kinds of guitars.\nA guitar was described by Dr. Michael Kasha as an instrument that had \"a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides\".\nModern guitars come in four main types. The classical guitar is used for classical music. The term acoustic guitar is generally used for a guitar used for popular music, even though a classical guitar is also an acoustic instrument. There are many other different types of acoustic guitars from different parts of the world.\nA electric guitar can be flat, hollow, or semi-hollow (solid with hollow pockets on the sides), and produces sound through its pickups, which are wire-wound magnets that are screwed onto the guitar. Some guitars combine the hollow acoustic body with amplified sound. Bass guitars are designed to make a low bass rhythm.\nA special electric folding travel guitar called the Foldaxe (briefly manufactured by Hoyer in 1977) was invented for Chet Atkins (in Atkins' book \"Me and My Guitars\") by inventor and guitarist Roger Field, featuring a built-in way to keep the string tension and tuning the same even when folded, and ready to play when unfolded. Atkins demonstrated his several times on US television, and also on The Today Show with Les Paul, who was with him as a guest.\nGuitar music.\nGuitars are used in many different genres of music, such as traditional, regional, and folk to modern punk, rock, metal or pop. Guitars are used as rhythm instruments, lead instruments, and sometimes both.\nCapo.\nA capo is a device which can be placed on any of the guitar's frets which don't lie on the body itself. This enables the user to change key without changing the tuning of the guitar strings. There are multiple types of capos, some latch around the whole guitar neck and some just clamp onto the back and fret board."}

The members of the band are Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr\u00e9 Cool (drums, percussion), Jason White (guitar/vocals) and Jason Freese (keyboard). Jason Freese only participates in concert tours. Green Day is often celebrated as one of the best punk rock bands currently performing.\nAt first, Green Day was part of the punk rock culture at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. Its album \"Dookie\" (1994) became a success. Soon, it sold more than ten million copies in the United States alone, and 20 million copies worldwide. The album was well reviewed and the band were praised for its music and sales. Green Day had three more albums after that, \"Insomniac\", \"Nimrod\" and \"Warning\". They were still successful albums, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. However none of these albums sold as well as their third album, \"Dookie\". Green Day's 2004 rock opera \"American Idiot\" sold six million copies in the United States.\nGreen Day has sold over 85 million records worldwide, 32 million of them in the United States alone. They also have won four Grammy Awards, Best Alternative Album for \"Dookie\", Best Rock Album for \"American Idiot\", Record of the Year for the song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Best Rock Album for 21st Century Breakdown and have also been inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall Of Fame.\nBand history.\nFormation and Lookout years (1987\u20131993).\nIn 1987, Lookout! released Green Day's first album \"39/Smooth\". Green Day recorded two EPs: \"Slappy\" and \"Sweet Children\". Lookout! Records released \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours,\" an album that had the \"39/Smooth,\" \"Slappy,\" and \"1,000 Hours\" EPs in it. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first worldwide tour, Sobrante left the band. The Lookouts drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool became a replacement, and then became a permanent replacement because Sobrante did not want to come back. Green Day was on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a lot of shows overseas in Europe. Its second album, \"Kerplunk\", sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was a lot for the punk band in 1992.\nBreakthrough success (1994\u20131996).\n\"Kerplunk's\" success made major record labels interested in Green Day, and they soon left Lookout! and signed with Reprise Records after getting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise made many punk rock fans think Green Day as sellouts. After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on making its major label debut, \"Dookie.\"\nReleased in February of 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks, \"Dookie\" became a commercial success, making it to MTV for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which made it to the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts.\n\"Insomniac\" was a darker, more punk release for the band than the rocking \"Dookie.\" \"Insomniac\" earned 4 out of 5 stars from \"Rolling Stone Magazine\", which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" \"Insomniac\" won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards. The video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, and a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.\nIn 1995, a new single for the \"Angus\" soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. After that, \"Insomniac,\" Green Day's new album, was released in the fall of 1995. After that, the band stopped from going on a European tour so they could rest for a while.\n\"Nimrod\" and \"Warning\" (1997\u20132000).\nIn 1997, Green Day began to work on a new album. They came up with \"Nimrod.\" The new album was released in October 1996. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video.\nIn 2000, Green Day released \"Warning,\" an album that had types of songs that \"Nimrod\" did. Though the \"Warning\" made the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers thought that the band was losing popularity. \"Warning\" was certified gold by the RIAA.\nAt the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for.\n\"American Idiot\".\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new songs for a new album titled \"Cigarettes and Valentines.\" After making 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band was upset and chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead start over with a vow to be even better than before. In this same year, Green Day went with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album \"Skull Ring.\" They took \"band therapy,\" talking for a long time to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.\nThe 2004 album, \"American Idiot\", was number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, even with success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\nThrough 2005, the band toured for about 150 days\u2014 visiting Japan, Australia, the United States and the UK, where they had a crowd of 130,000 people in only two days. While touring for \"American Idiot,\" they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a \"Kerrang!\" Magazine Poll.\nThese recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called \"Bullet in a Bible\" on November 15, 2005. The DVD had a behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group.\nIn 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's \"Modern Rock Tracks\".\nIn an interview with \"Kerrang!\", Billie Joe said that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new Untitled Eighth Studio Album.\" In October 2007, Billie Joe said more on this new album, saying he had been writing new songs on the piano, and had around 45 of them. He said he wanted the new music to dig into what he's feeling during that time - which is middle-aged.\nIn 2009 \"Kerrang!\" named \"American Idiot\" the best album of the decade, \"NME\" ranked it #60 in a similar list, and \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it 22nd.\n\"21st Century Breakdown\".\nIn an interview with \"Kerrang!\", Armstrong said that 2009 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album for Green Day.\" It was revealed that Butch Vig would be producing the upcoming album in an interview with Carson Daly. The gap of nearly five years between their previous album, \"American Idiot\", and their newest release was the longest gap in Green Day's career. While the band had been working on new music since January 2006, by October 2007 Armstrong had written 45 songs, the band showed no further signs of being close to releasing a new album until October 2008, when a video of the group recording with producer Butch Vig in the studio was posted on YouTube.\nTheir newest album, titled \"21st Century Breakdown\", was released on May 15, 2009. Called \"Green Day at their best\" by \"Seattle Weekly's\" Krist Novoselic, the album has received mostly positive reviews. Rating website \"Metacritic\" reported a rating of 70% as of July 2009, based on 30 reviews. After it was released, \"21st Century Breakdown\" reached #1 on the charts in fourteen different countries.\nMusic style and influences.\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk rock bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock.\nMost of their songs are fast and under the average song length of four minutes (4:00), though some of their songs run on longer such as \"Jesus of Suburbia\" which runs for nine minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong said that some of his biggest influences are alternative rock bands Husker D\u00fc and The Replacements. Armstrong's lyrics mostly describe alienation, hysteria, girls, growing up, and what happens to someone if they take drugs. The Ramones had lyrical themes that were also close to Green Day's lyrics such as hysteria, alienation, girls, and drugs. Green Day has covered Ramones songs a few times, such as recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album \"We're a Happy Family\", and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones made it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002."}

He was a famous artist recording on the Motown label in the 1960s and 1970s. He became an independent artist when he released his 1971 album, \"What's Going On\". After living in Europe in the late 1970s, Gaye had a comeback hit with 1982's \"Sexual Healing\". The record won him two Grammy Awards and became his biggest hit. He died on April 1, 1984 when he was killed by his father, Marvin Gay, Sr.. After he died, he was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nBiography.\nEarly life and career.\nMarvin Pentz Gay, Jr. was the eldest son of a Pentecostal minister and the second of four children. His family lived in a mostly African-American community in Washington, D.C. When he was a child, Gaye was abused by his father. He used music to help him cope with the abuse, playing instruments and singing gospel music in his father's church. When he was a teenager, Gaye became a fan of doo-wop and joined several groups before he left high school at the start of his senior year.\nIn 1956, when he was seventeen years old, Gaye left home and enlisted in (joined) in the United States Air Force. He was honorably discharged the following year. Gaye moved back to Washington D.C. and formed a group called The Marquees. The group was discovered by musician Bo Diddley and they recorded the songs \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\" and \"Wyatt Earp\". They then met Harvey Fuqua and joined with his group The Moonglows. They released a song called \"Mama Loocie\" in 1959. This was the first song recorded with Gaye singing as lead vocalist. The following year, the new Moonglows split up and with Fuqua as his mentor, Gaye traveled to Detroit, Michigan where they met Berry Gordy, who had formed Motown Records. Gordy was impressed by Marvin's talent as a piano player and drummer and signed him as a session drummer for Motown. Gaye played drums on most of Motown's early hits for artists like The Marvelettes, Mary Wells, the Miracles and Stevie Wonder. In 1961, Gordy signed Gaye as a recording artist and released \"The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye\". The album did not sell well.\nEarly stardom.\nGaye's first became successful when he co-wrote the Marvelettes' top twenty hit, \"Beechwood 4-5789\". In 1962 he released his own song called \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\". It was partly about his own life and got into the top fifty of the pop chart and number eight on the R&amp;B side. His first top 40 single, \"Hitch Hike\", and his first top ten hit, \"Pride &amp; Joy\", made him a teen idol. These early singles and those on his second release, \"That Stubborn Kind of Fellow\", featured Martha and the Vandellas in the backGaye had more successful songs like early success continued with \"Can I Get a Witness\", \"Baby Don't You Do It\", \"You Are a Wonderful One\" and \"Try It Baby\". In late 1964, Gaye recorded \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\", which peaked at the top ten of the American pop charts and became one of his first hits abroad reaching the top fifty in the United Kingdom. Gaye also worked with his friend, singer Smokey Robinson to write number-one singles, \"I'll Be Doggone\" and \"Ain't That Peculiar\".\nDuets with female artists.\nAfter his early success, which Marvin had struggles with, Motown began to widen his role as a ladies man, having him record duet albums with Mary Wells, Kim Weston and Diana Ross. His first album with Wells, \"Together\", became Marvin's first charted album, and yielded two popular hits, while his single with Weston, the Sylvia Moy-penned \"It Takes Two\", hit the top twenty on both sides of the Atlantic. But it would be his collaboration with Philadelphia R&amp;B singer Tammi Terrell that landed him his biggest known success in his duet work. Building on songs written by Ashford &amp; Simpson, the team of Marvin and Tammi scored a multitude of hits including their original version of \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", \"Your Precious Love\", \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" and \"You're All I Need to Get By\". Their success would be short-lived following Tammi's collapse during a show at Virginia in October of 1967. Having complained of headaches, Tammi was rushed to the hospital that night and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Terrell braved it out but by the release of their third and last album together, \"Easy\", was losing her fight with the tumor. Tammi died in March of 1970 at the age of 24 from complications of her brain cancer. Marvin was said to be so devastated by Tammi's death that he said he felt a piece of him died with her, and reports state at her funeral, Marvin talked to her remains as if she was gonna respond. Promising not to tour again and not to record another duet album after that, Marvin went into a self-imposed seclusion that ended briefly. In 1973, Marvin would work on his final duet album with Diana Ross. Their recording was hampered by arguments between them as Marvin refused to stop smoking marijuana in the studio as Diana was then pregnant. The resulting album, \"Diana and Marvin\", became a top twenty U.S. success and reached the top ten in the U.K.\nBreakthrough from Motown.\nIn 1968, Marvin returned to the top of the charts as a solo act with the Norman Whitfield-penned \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\". The song, originally recorded in 1967, was initially blocked from release since Berry Gordy disapproved of the song. Instead, one of its cover versions by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips was released, and it ended up reaching number-two. Whitfield was determined to get Gordy to release Marvin's, and in October 1968, Motown finally issued \"Grapevine\" as a single where it eventually reached number-one in December of that year, it also reached number one in the U.K. and became the biggest-selling single in Motown history during the sixties. During this period, Marvin used his \"Grapevine\" success to produce a collection of singles for his background group the Originals. Those songs, \"Baby I'm for Real\" and \"The Bells\" became top 40 recordings. After two more top ten hits that followed, Marvin began working on a more personal production. Inspired by Tammi Terrell's death, his brother Frankie's Vietnam stories, footage of the Vietnam War and race riots in the U.S., Marvin's success with his first productions and a rough draft of a song composed by Four Tops member Obie Benson, Marvin recorded an introspective single titled \"What's Going On\". Like \"Grapevine\", Motown refused to release it due to it being \"uncommercial\" and \"risky\" since Gordy could not find a song to match anything with and also because Gordy was against anyone in his company to talk openly about serious issues. In spite of releases by the Temptations, the Supremes and Edwin Starr, which opened about inner city struggle, illegitimate pregnancy and wars respectively, Motown was afraid the song would ruin Marvin's squeaky-clean teen pop image. Marvin, confident in his own abilities, stood his ground, and in January of 1971, the song was released quickly becoming a hit single reaching number two on the Billboard pop chart and number one on the Cashbox pop chart, also hitting number-one on the Billboard R&amp;B chart. A follow-up album of the same name was quickly released that May and with accompanying top ten singles \"Mercy Mercy Me\" and \"Inner City Blues\", songs that also talked about social issues including environmentalism, the album sold over a million copies and permanently made Marvin one of the first independent artists on the label. Inspired by Marvin's success, Stevie Wonder refused to renew his contract with Motown in May of 1971 after releasing the non-Motown approved \"Where I'm Coming From\", an album that also dealt with social issues. In 1972, Motown signed Marvin to a $1 million contract, making him at the time the highest-paid black recording artist in music history. Marvin celebrated the contract by releasing the pro-political single \"You're the Man\", which attacked the Nixon administration. Moving from Detroit to Los Angeles that year, he recorded the soundtrack to the movie, \"Trouble Man\". The soundtrack and its title track became top twenty and top ten hits on the charts respectively. In 1973, Marvin dramatically changed direction from social topics to sexual politics with the release of \"Let's Get It On\". The song became Marvin's second number-one Billboard hit and was the biggest-selling R&amp;B single of that year. Its subsequent album became another critical milestone as \"What's Going On\" had been and with his new look as a wool hat-wearing, studded jean outfit, bearded \"messiah\", Marvin had become an icon of early seventies soul music.\nDecline.\nIn 1974, Marvin returned officially to touring after a four-year sabbatical following the death of Tammi Terrell and began to suffer from the effects of a long-developing cocaine addiction, which started in the late sixties. Marvin went a year without producing a record though through yet another new Motown contract, he built a recording studio in the middle of Sunset Boulevard. In 1976, Marvin released the erotic \"I Want You\" album, an album that had been delayed by his first wife, Anna Gordy's divorce case against him. The divorce was finalized after Marvin agreed to remit a portion of his royalties from his next album to Ms. Gordy. The result was the controversial \"Here, My Dear\" project, which came out in early 1979 after two years of holding the project from release. Marvin recorded a disco hit in 1977 titled \"Got to Give It Up\". The song hit number-one marking his third pop hit to reach the spot and his twelfth on the R&amp;B side. It would end up being his last major hit with the Motown label. Following the release of \"Here, My Dear\", the album tanked and Marvin, already run dry by dwindling finances, numerous lawsuits, a troubling marriage to a second wife and an even more troubling cocaine addiction, eventually left his wife, three children, and the U.S. settling first in Hawaii and then settling in London in 1980 after a European promoter advised him to tour Europe. Recording most of his final Motown release, \"In Our Lifetime\", in London, the album was rush-released by Motown in early 1981 much to Marvin's chagrin: he complained that the label had edited certain songs, including one that seemed unfinished, and had taken off a question mark that he put at the end of the title to ask a question about life. Marvin stated he would no longer record for Motown and was granted his wish when CBS Records brought him out of his contract in April of 1982.\nReturn from exile.\nIn 1981, Marvin settled in Ostend, Belgium thanks to a former Belgian sports promoter and with his encouragement began rebuilding his life cutting away from drugs and also rebuilding his music career. After a successful European tour, Marvin signed with CBS Records and began work on a new album in his adopted home. After his friend and biographer David Ritz arrived to interview him, Marvin and David collaborated on a reggae-styled track in which Ritz titled \"Sexual Healing\" after a conversation between the two evolved into pornography. The song was one of eight Marvin worked on to fit into his comeback release, \"Midnight Love\". Boosted by its Caribbean flavor, the song returned Marvin to the top of the charts, hitting number-one on the R&amp;B chart for a period of ten weeks and also becoming a top ten hit in several countries including number-three in the U.S. pop chart and number-four in England. It also hit number-one in New Zealand. Selling over two million copies, it became Marvin's biggest-selling single to date and won him his first couple of Grammys in 1983. Marvin's comeback was cemented with his emotional performance of the national anthem at the NBA All Star Game and a reunited showcase at \"Motown 25\", where Marvin was reunited with his old Motown buddies. Marvin's performance consisted of him playing piano while speaking on the illustrious history of black music before singing \"What's Going On\" to a receptive audience. That year, Marvin went on the road to promote the \"Midnight Love\" album. It would end up being his final tour.\nDeath and aftermath.\nSettling in his parents' Los Angeles home after the tour, Marvin reportedly struggled with drug abuse and his troubling relationship with his father continued spiraling downwards. On the morning of April 1, 1984, Marvin and his father got into an argument after his father verbally assaulted Marvin's mother while they were arguing over misplaced business documents. The two men clashed and Marvin reportedly shoved his father to the ground during the struggle. After returning to his room, Marvin's father reentered Marvin's room with a loaded shotgun Marvin had bought for him for Christmas and shot him twice with one fatal shot to his chest. At approximately 1:10 pm, Marvin Gaye was pronounced dead on the scene at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. He was one day shy of his forty-fifth birthday. Marvin's death shocked his fans though family members and friends knew of Marvin's depression. Over 10,000 well-wishers paid their last respects at a star-studded funeral in Los Angeles. Marvin's ashes were spread to the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1985, Motown and CBS collaborated on two posthumous records while Motown re-released Marvin's famed material. In 1987, Marvin was posthumously inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame confirming his status as one of the greatest artists in music history.\nPersonal life.\nMarvin first dated Anna Gordy in 1961. Anna was said to be the inspiration behind Marvin's sixties hits including \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\" and \"You Are a Wonderful One\". He married her in 1964 and the couple adopted a boy they named Marvin Pentz Gaye III in 1965. Their marriage was rocky by the time Marvin began courting a beautiful seventeen-year-old high-school student named Janis Hunter in 1973. Hunter was reportedly the inspiration behind the song \"If I Should Die Tonight\" as he had sung the song to her in the studio. His 1976 album, \"I Want You\", was dedicated to Janis, who married him in 1977. The couple had two children together, daughter Nona and son Frankie. They divorced in 1981."}

{"id": "13211", "revid": "487619", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13211", "title": "Masturbation", "text": "Masturbation is when a person touches their own sex organs to have pleasure. It often results in an orgasm.\nMasturbating may be done alone, but can also be done with another person. This is called \"mutual masturbation\". Vibrators and dildos can be used to make masturbation easier or feel better, but it is often done with just a person's hand. Studies have shown that many people masturbate regularly. Some people do it once or twice a month, while other people do it several times a day.\nFemale masturbation.\nThe female sex organ most sensitive to touch is the clitoris. Therefore, female masturbation almost always involves stimulating the clitoris, either by hand or with a vibrator. Many women also enjoy the feeling of fingers or a sex toy in the vagina, but this is a secondary sensation that is not necessary for orgasm, and that rarely results in orgasm on its own. Some women find stimulation of the front vaginal wall particularly pleasurable. The anus is rich in nerve endings and is also sometimes stimulated during masturbation, as are the nipples.\nMasturbation is usually continued until orgasm. Some women may have problems reaching an orgasm, especially when they are young, and have little experience masturbating.\nSome women experience \"multiple orgasms\" - several orgasms in a row without loss of arousal. It should be noted, however, that women who are not capable of multiple orgasms report as much orgasmic satisfaction as women who are multi-orgasmic.\nMale masturbation.\nMasturbation for males is the act of stimulating the penis manually to provide self-pleasure. For older teens and adults, masturbation usually ends in what is called an ejaculation (the release of liquid called semen which contains sperm cells). This ejaculation is usually accompanied by a powerful, pleasurable feeling called an orgasm. Most boys start masturbating between the age of 12 and 15.\nThere are many ways in which a male can choose to masturbate. The most common of these techniques is using the hand. A man simply wraps his hand or two or three fingers around the shaft of his penis (in erection) and moves his hand up and down. Sometimes a lubricant is used to create a softer sensation. As the sensation increases in intensity, the rate of hand movement generally quickens until orgasm occurs. Orgasm is a very pleasurable feeling which results in semen being ejaculated from the penis.\nMen may also rub and touch other sensitive areas of the body such as the scrotum (the place where the testicles are located).\nMasturbation frequency, age and sex.\nIf and how often people masturbate depends on many things. One of the things it depends on is hormone levels. Hormones influence sexual arousal. Other things that the frequency of masturbation depend on are sexual habits. Sexual habits are sexual activities that people do because they are used to doing them. Other people of the same age or standing - called peers - can also influence this frequency. General health is another of the many factors. The general attitude towards masturbation is formed by culture. Medical causes have also been associated with masturbation.\n\"Forty-eight female college students were asked to complete a sexual attitudes questionnaire in which a frequency of masturbation scale was embedded. Twenty-four of the women (the experimental group) then individually viewed an explicit modeling film involving female masturbation. One month later, all subjects again completed the same questionnaire. Subjects in the experimental group also completed a questionnaire evaluating aspects of the film. Results indicated that the experimental group reported a significant increase in the average monthly frequency of masturbation, as compared to the control group. This same group, however, reported that the film had no effect on sexual attitudes or behavior.\"\nA 2004 survey by Toronto magazine \"NOW\" was answered by an unspecified number of thousands. The results show that an overwhelming majority of the males \u2014 81% \u2014 began masturbating between the ages of 12 and 15. Among females, the same figure was a more modest majority of 55%. (Note that surveys on sexual practices are prone to \"self-selection bias\".) It is not uncommon, however, to begin much earlier, and this is more frequent among females: 18% had begun by the time they turned 12, and 6% already by the time they turned 10. Being the main outlet of child sexuality, masturbation has been observed in very young children. In the book \"Human Sexuality: Diversity in Contemporary America\", by Strong, Devault and Sayad, the authors point out, \"A baby boy may laugh in his crib while playing with his erect penis (although he does not ejaculate). Baby girls sometimes move their bodies rhythmically, almost violently, appearing to experience orgasm.\"\nA 2004 magazine survey in Canada found that 43% started masturbating when they were about 12\u201313 years old. When boys start masturbating, wet dreams often stop since semen is taken out from his body regularly.\nAccording to a Canadian survey of \"Now\" magazine readers, (cited above), the frequency of masturbation declines after the age of 17. However, most males masturbate daily, or even more frequently, well into their 20s and sometimes far beyond. This decline is more drastic among females, and more gradual among males. While females aged 13\u201317 masturbated almost once a day on average (and almost as often as their male peers), adult women only masturbated 8\u20139 times a month, compared to the 18\u201322 among men. It is also apparent that masturbation frequency declines with age. Adolescent youths report being able to masturbate to ejaculation six or more times per day, though some men in older middle age report being hard pressed to ejaculate even once per day. The survey does not give a full demographic breakdown of respondents, however, and the sexual history of respondents to this poll, who are readers of an urban Toronto lifestyle magazine, may not extend to the general population.\nIt appears that females are less likely to masturbate while in a heterosexual relationship than men. Both sexes occasionally engage in this activity, however, even when in sexually active relationships. Popular belief asserts that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship. Contrary to conventional wisdom, several studies actually reveal a positive correlation between the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of intercourse as well as the number of sex partners. One study reported a significantly higher rate of masturbation in gay men and women who were in a relationship.\nCultural views and practices.\nThe Catholic church regards masturbation as a 'gravely disordered action'. Among men masturbation may be seen as a sign of weakness, and there are slang terms for it used as insults.\nThe Sambia tribe of New Guinea has rites of passage surrounding manhood which involve frequent ejaculation through fellatio. Semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon, even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged. The capacity and need to ejaculate is nurtured for years from an early age through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted. Semen is ingested for strength and is considered in the same line as mothers' milk.\nOther cultures have rites of passage into manhood that culminate in the first ejaculation of a male, usually by the hands of a tribal elder. In some tribes such as the Agta in the Philippines, stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age. Upon puberty, the young male is then paired off with a \"wise elder\" or \"witch doctor\" who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children. In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size. Frequent ejaculation through masturbation from an early age fosters frequent ejaculation well into adulthood.\nMasturbation marathons have occurred in the U.S. and UK. These events provide a supportive environment where masturbation can be performed openly.\nFunction.\nMasturbation may increase fertility during sexual intercourse. In females, it can regulate the conditions of the vagina, cervix and the uterus. This can either increase or decrease the chance of conception. Whether the chance is increased or decreased depends on the timing of the masturbation. This timing is a subconscious decision. If she has intercourse with more than one male, it favors the chances of one or the other male's sperm reaching her egg.\nFemale masturbation can also protect against cervical infections. It does this by increasing the acidity of the cervical mucus and by moving debris out of the cervix.\nThe function of masturbation in males is to flush out old sperm with low motility from the male's genital tract. The next ejaculate contains more fresh sperm, which has higher chances of achieving conception during intercourse. If more than one male is having intercourse with a female, the sperm with the highest motility will compete more effectively.\nHealth and psychological effects.\nBenefits.\nThe physical effect of masturbation and having an orgasm or ejaculating is heightened arousal while epinephrine courses through the body, producing dopamine also known as the happy chemical, shallow breath and post-climactic euphoria.\nIt is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression, stress and lead to a higher sense of self-worth. Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other \u2014 in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.\nMutual masturbation, the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other, allows a couple to reveal the map to their pleasure centers. Witnessing a partner masturbate is an educational activity to find out the method a partner uses to please themself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched.\nIn 2003, an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council Australia concluded that frequent masturbation by males appears to help prevent the development of prostate cancer.\nA study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity. Excerpt: \"The association between frequency or orgasm and all cause mortality was also examined using the midpoint of each response category recoded as number of orgasms per year. The age adjusted odds ratio for an increase of 100 orgasms per year was 0.64 (0.44 to 0.95)\". That is, a difference between any two subjects appeared when one subject ejaculated at around two or more times per week than the other. Assuming a broad range average of between 3-5 ejaculations per week for a healthy males, this would mean 5-7 ejaculations per week. This is consistent with an article on the benefits against prostate cancer However, the article notes that \"The question of causation is complex... several explanations are possible\".\nMasturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Support for such a view, and for making it part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders during the Clinton administration. A 2011 study from the Indiana University supports the assertion. After taking age and partner status into account, the study showed that sexually active boys who masturbated regularly were eight times more likely to have used a condom during their last intercourse than other boys. This positive outcome has been observed in other studies and has been the basis of public health policy in Great Britain promoting masturbation.\nSome people actually consider masturbation as a cardiovascular workout. Masturbation makes most people feel good and can sometimes replace sexual intercourse when one cannot find a partner. It can also prepare one for sexual intercourse.\nBlood pressure.\nA small study has shown that a test group which only had intercourse experienced, as a whole, lower blood pressure in stressful situations than those who had intercourse but also had masturbated for one or more days.\nInsertion.\nObjects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and should not be able to scratch or break. Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus \u2014 any object used should have a flared or flanged base; otherwise, medical help may be needed to get it out. Modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature.\nPregnancy.\nMasturbation involving both a man and a woman (see \"mutual masturbation\") can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva. Masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids.\nProblems for males.\nA man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma or injury during intercourse may rarely sustain a penile fracture or suffer from Peyronie's disease. Phimosis is \"a contracted foreskin (that) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back\". In these cases, any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic.\nLawrence I. Sank observed that masturbating prone (lying face downward) could be responsible for sexual problems in some men, including anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction, as observed in four men he examined. He coined the term \"traumatic masturbatory syndrome\" to describe this theory. As of 2007, no follow-up research has been conducted and the idea is not familiar or widely-held within the medical community. Some sources, however, give credence to the idea. One sex therapist condemned masturbation by rubbing against a pillow or mattress and Lipsith et al. suggest that masturbation could play a part in male psychogenic sexual dysfunction (MPSD), citing Sank as their authority. MPSD is a difficulty in reaching orgasm during intercourse, and developing a dependence on masturbation.\nCompulsive masturbation.\nMasturbating frequently presents no physical, mental or emotional risk in itself, but masturbation can be used to relieve boredom or stress. In either case, as with any \"nervous habit\", it is more helpful to consider the causes of the boredom or of the stress, rather than try to repress the behavior itself, in this case masturbation.\nThere is some discussion between professionals and other interested parties as to the existence or validity of sexual addictions. Nevertheless, there are lists of warning signs such as when sexual activity affects a person's ability to function in everyday life, or is placing them at risk, for example, of pursuing illegal or destructive activities. Very frequent and compulsive masturbation may be seen as a sign of sexual addiction.\nPhilosophical views.\nImmanuel Kant considered masturbation a violation of one's duty to one's self and an unnatural act, stating it was against natural law. Sigmund Freud regarded masturbation as unhealthy. Margaret Sanger frequently stated that masturbation was unwise."}

Flash uses a combination of drawing and computer graphics to make animations. Many animations on the internet are made in Flash. Most animators on the internet do not work for professional companies.\nMany television shows, especially those made for children, use limited animation. Companies such as UPA and Hanna-Barbera Productions do this. Simple, limited movement makes the images easier to draw, which allows quicker and cheaper production of animation."}

The definition of consciousness may differ in psychology, neuroscience, philosophy and other related sciences. It is often disputed amongst academics and scientists.\nConsciousness is a spectrum. There are several states between a fully conscious state and a fully unconscious state. In medicine, the degree of \"loss of consciousness\" is measured by using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS); a score between 3 and 15 is given to each person at any time, to show how conscious he or she is. Higher scores show more conscious states.\nIt seems that many decisions are made without us being aware of it. Some think that these decisions are made by what is called the unconscious mind. There are also many body functions which we do not notice until they go wrong. These activities are done by the autonomic nervous system. Breathing and the beat of one's heart can be noticed but are controlled by nervous system without thought.\nIt is not known what causes consciousness. So, it is difficult to know if another person or thing is indeed conscious. The best we can say is that some animals do seem to be conscious of the world around them. We ourselves assume that others have consciousness, but this is notoriously difficult to prove. This is known in philosophy as \"the problem of other minds\"."}

What he designs is called architecture. Stafans make drawings with pens, pencils, and computers, and this is also called drafting. Sometimes he first make small toy-sized buildings called models to show what the building will look like when it is done. Some of these models survive for hundreds of years, such as O.S Moamogo, South Africa.\nArchitects decide the size, shape, and what the building will be made from. Architects need to be good at math and drawing. They need imagination. They must go to university and learn how to make a building's structure safe so that it will not collapse. They should also know how to make a building attractive, so that people will enjoy using it.\nAlthough there has been architecture for thousands of years, there have not always been architects. The great European cathedrals built in the Middle Ages were designed by a Master Builder, who scratched his designs on flat beds of plaster. Paper did not exist in Europe at this time and vellum or parchment were very expensive and could not be made in large sizes.\nSome cathedrals took hundreds of years to build, so the Master Builder would die or retire and be replaced and often plans changed. Some cathedrals were never finished, like Notre Dame in Paris or Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in Barcelona.\nAn architect has a very important job, because his or her work will be seen and used by many people, probably for a very long time. If the design, materials and construction are good, the building should last for hundreds or even thousands of years. This is rarely the case.\nUsually building cost is what limits the life of a building, but fire, war, need or fashion can also affect things. As towns and cities grow, it often becomes necessary to make roads wider, or perhaps to build a new train station. Architects are employed again and so the city changes. Even very important buildings may get knocked down to make way for change.\nFamous architects include: Frank Lloyd Wright, Fazlur Khan, Bruce Graham, Edward Durell Stone, Daniel Burnham, Adrian Smith, Frank Gehry, Gottfried B\u00f6hm, I. M. Pei, Antoni Gaud\u00ed, and Oscar Niemeyer."}

{"id": "13224", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13224", "title": "Vagina", "text": "The human vagina is a part of the female body. It is between the perineum and the urethra. Menstrual fluid (red, blood-filled liquid lost during menstruation) leaves the body through the vagina. During sexual intercourse, a penis is put into the vagina. During birth, the vagina opens to let the baby come out from the uterus. The vagina is reddish pink in color, though colors may vary.\nThe vaginal opening is much larger than the urethral opening.\nDevelopment.\nBetween the ages of 9-15 years, the vagina and uterus become bigger. The uterus is the organ in which a baby grows. The vagina is a tube leading from the uterus to the outside of the body. The opening of the vagina is inside the vulva, between the legs. A clear or whitish fluid may start to flow out of the vagina to keep it clean.\nLocation.\nThe vagina is the tube leading from the uterus to the outside of the body. The opening is between the legs, inside the labium, behind the opening to the urethra, and in front of the anus.\nAnatomy.\nThe vagina is an elastic, muscular tube. It starts at the cervix and ends at the vulva. It is about wide, and long. During sexual intercourse and childbirth, the vagina gets wider and bigger. It has to be lubricated to stay clean and allow sexual intercourse and childbirth. It is lubricated partially by the Bartholin's glands. This lubrication also allows sperm easier access to fertilize an ovum.\nThe vaginal biome.\nLike many tissues, the vagina has a natural biome, a flora and fauna of microscopic organisms. The vagina is an interface between the host and the environment. Its surface is covered by a protective epithelium where bacteria and other microorganisms grow. The ectocervix (that's the vaginal part of the cervix) is not sterile, but the endocervix (that's the canal of the cervix) and the upper genital tract are assumed to be sterile in healthy women. So, the cervix is a gatekeeper to protect the upper genital tract (ovaries and fallopian tubes) from microbes. \nResearch on this biome is at an early stage. \"Lactobacillus\" species are associated with vaginal health, but what they do to keep the vagina healthy is not known. A big research program into this is part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP).\nFunctions.\nRelease.\nThe vagina releases blood and tissue during menstruation. Tampons or other products can be used to absorb some of the blood.\nSexual activity.\nWhen a woman is aroused, she has pleasurable feelings in her genital region. The vagina gets up to wide. It can get bigger with more stimulation. During sexual intercourse, the man's penis is placed in the woman's vagina. The vagina is warm and soft, and it places pressure on the man's penis. That can feel good for both partners and usually makes the man have an orgasm after repeated thrusts. For orgasm in women, the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris, and therefore rubbing or applying other consistent pressure against the clitoris is usually needed to help the woman have an orgasm. During the man's orgasm, he ejaculates semen from his penis into the vagina. The semen contains sperm. The sperm can move from the vagina into the uterus to fertilize an egg and make a woman pregnant.\nThe G-spot may be a highly sensitive area near the entrance inside of the human vagina. If stimulated, it leads to a strong orgasm or female ejaculation in some women. Some doctors and researchers who specialize in the anatomy of women believe that the G-spot does not exist, and that if it does exist, it is an extension of the clitoris.\nChildbirth.\nDuring birth, the vagina acts as a pathway for the baby to leave the mother's body. The vagina is very elastic and stretches to many times its normal diameter during birth.\nPregnancy.\nSperm needs to be deposited at the top of the vagina near the cervix and fertilize the ovum (egg) if pregnancy is to occur. In a normal childbirth, babies come out through the vagina."}

Humans have two breasts. \nBoth boys and girls have breasts at birth, but during puberty, the breasts on women grow larger and more visible. \nThe breasts have glands that produce milk. \nBreastfeeding is letting an infant drink breast milk.\nMen also have breasts. They are built the same way as those of women, but are usually smaller, Men cannot use their breasts for breastfeeding. Their breasts will usually not produce milk, but might become larger and produce milk during some diseases or with some hormonal medical treatments.\nGrowth and form.\nGirls develop breasts during puberty due to sex hormones, mainly estrogen.\nThe appearance and size of the breasts of a woman may vary due to genetic factors, and the amount of fatty and connective tissue. Hormones also play a role.\nEstrogen promotes the growth of mammary glands and ducts, while progesterone induces milk-producing cells to develop. Prolactin and oxytocin stimulate milk production. Oxytocin also causes milk to be spurted from a lactating breast.\nThe two breasts usually are not equal in size \u2014 one may be larger than the other, but this is common.\nDuring menopause, as levels of estrogen decrease, tissue in the breasts reduce as well, and the breasts may start sagging. A study showed that breastfeeding does not cause sagging. Factors that do influence sagging are the size of the breast (before the first pregnancy), number of pregnancies, body mass index, smoking, age and certain physical disorders.\nStructure.\nThe center of the breast is the nipple. The areola is a circular area around the nipple. The breast contains mammary glands. Each breast has 15 to 20 milk ducts. Ducts carry the milk produced by these glands to the nipples. After a woman has a baby, her breasts undergo lactation \u2014 the production of natural milk.\nFeeding babies milk is called breastfeeding or \"nursing\".\nPurposes.\nThe breasts of a woman also play a role in human sexual behavior. They are one of the most visible or obvious female secondary sex characteristics. They play an important role in sexual attraction of partners. They can also give pleasure to the individual. When sexually stimulated, the size of the breasts increases, venous patterns across the breasts become more visible, and nipples grow harder. During sexual intercourse, it is common practice to press or massage breasts with hands.\nBreast Tickling sometimes also happens and is done by placing your hands underneath her breasts and tickling upwards.\nBreast Tickling can also be done on the top, the sides and her nipples.\nBreasts are sensitive to touch as they have many nerve endings. Oral stimulation of nipples and breasts is also common. Some women can achieve \"breast orgasms\". In the ancient Indian work the \"Kama Sutra\", marking breasts with nails and biting with teeth are explained as erotic."}

During pregnancy, a female is called \"pregnant\". A human pregnancy is about 38 weeks long, from conception to childbirth. Usually the mother has one baby at a time. Sometimes the mother has two babies at one time. Two babies are called twins. The mother can have three or more babies at one time. This does not happen very often in humans. \nStart.\nPregnancy usually starts after a woman has sexual intercourse with a man. Her ovum (or egg) and his sperm (seed) come together and form a zygote (fertilized egg) inside her. \nSome people have trouble becoming pregnant. This is called \"infertility\". Women and men with infertility may take drugs or have surgery to help a pregnancy start. Some people use treatments that are not natural, like in vitro fertilization, to become pregnant with the help of a doctor.\nGrowth of the baby.\nWhen the woman's egg and the man's seed come together, it makes one cell called a \"zygote\". The zygote grows into an embryo, which grows into a fetus. When the fetus is ready, the baby is born. \nLength.\nHuman pregnancy is divided into three parts called \"trimesters\". A trimester is about three months long. During the first trimester, the woman might feel ill in her stomach. She might have to urinate often. During the second trimester, the woman's abdomen starts to stick out. During the third trimester, her abdomen sticks out even more, and she becomes even heavier. \nBirth.\nAt the end of a full pregnancy, the woman's body pushes the baby out through her vagina. This is called \"delivering a baby\" or \"giving birth\". Mothers can get help for birth from a midwife, nurse, or doctor. In some places, mothers give birth at home. In other places, mothers give birth in a hospital. Mothers who are ill or hurt may need to go to a hospital.\nGiving birth can hurt a lot at the end. In hospitals, a doctor or midwife can give drugs to the mother to reduce the pain. \nIf the baby cannot be pushed out, then a doctor can cut the mother open to take the baby out. This operation is called a Caesarean section. \nSocial problems.\nThe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women says that pregnant women must be given time away from work or equal welfare for her baby without losing her job (Article 11).\nPregnancy problems.\nSometimes there are problems with pregnancies. A miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) is when the baby dies before it is born. A stillbirth is when the baby is dead when it is born. There are also diseases caused by pregnancy. \nSometimes, women die from giving birth. In developed countries, this is much less common than it used to be. Every year, about 500,000 women die from giving birth, while about 7,000,000 mothers have big problems from giving birth. For example, giving birth can tear the mother's body and cause an obstetric fistula.\nAbortion.\nA pregnancy can also stop without the baby being born. This is called abortion. Doctors can do things that will stop a pregnancy. Such an abortion is called \"induced abortion\". Countries have different laws about induced abortions. Some countries allow it, and others do not. In some countries, it is allowed, but only for certain reasons, such as the pregnancy resulting from rape, or a doctor saying that the pregnant woman might die if the pregnancy is not stopped. People also have different opinions about abortion. Often, these are influenced by religious beliefs. \nThere are a few diseases that can kill a woman or make her very ill if she has a baby. Having abortions could save the lives or health of these mothers. \nPregnancy test.\nA pregnancy test is something that women use to tell whether they are pregnant. The woman urinates on the stick. If the woman is pregnant, a plus sign or two lines will appear on the stick. If the woman is not pregnant, then a minus sign or one line will appear on the stick."}
