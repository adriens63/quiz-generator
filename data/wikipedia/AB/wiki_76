{"id": "886927", "revid": "508885", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=886927", "title": "Critical race theory", "text": "Critical race theory (CRT) is a way that scholars study and teach civil rights and the history of race, especially in the United States. Critical race theory is there to show another way of thinking and doing things than mainstream American liberal racial justice. CRT looks at social, cultural, and legal things and the way they affect race and racism. CRT says that the reason white people ended up and stayed richer and more politically powerful than people of other races was not only because of people acting racist on purpose. It was also because of complicated, changing social rules that people didn't always know were there.\nAmeican legal scholars started CRT in the mid-1970s. Derrick Bell, Alan Freeman, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Richard Delgado, Cheryl Harris, Charles R. Lawrence III, Mari Matsuda, and Patricia J. Williams wrote about it. It became a movement by the 1980s. Critical race theory included some theories of critical legal studies (CLS) but it put more focus on race. CRT uses critical theory and scholars Antonio Gramsci, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and W. E. B. DuBois are in it, as well as the Black Power, Chicano, and radical feminist movements from the 1960s and 1970s.\nCRT scholars think about race as an intersectional social construct. \"Social construct\" means that it comes from society's rules and not from the physical world. For example, money is a social construct. A piece of paper is worth money because the society agrees that it is. For example, which continent someone's ancestors came from is a real thing. However, whether or not that is important is a social construct. When CRT says that race is not \"biologically grounded and natural,\" it does not mean that human beings from different parts of Eearth do not look different. It means that the rules around looking different are made up. Instead, they think of race as an idea that makes life easier for white people by making it worse for people in other races. In legal studies, CRT says that even laws that are color blind, meaning laws that look like they are not about race, can still have have racist effects. CRT focuses on intersectionality, which means that race affects other identities, for example gender and social class, to produce complicated effects on power and advantage.\nScholars who do not think CRT is good say that CRT acts as if storytelling is more important than evidence and logic, that it does not treat truth and merit as important enough, and that it opposes liberalism.\nSince 2020, conservative U.S. lawmakers have tried to keep CRT and other antiracism education out of primary and secondary schools. CRT is only taught at the university level, though some lower-level curricula do teach some CRT without calling it that. Supporters of CRT say these lawmakers don't talk honestly about CRT and that the what they really want people to stop talking about racism, equality, social justice, and the history of race in America.\nDefinitions.\nIn his introduction to the comprehensive 1995 publication of critical race theory's key writings, Cornel West describes CRT as \"an intellectual movement that is both particular to our postmodern (and conservative) times and part of a long tradition of human resistance and liberation.\" \nLaw professor Roy L. Brooks defines critical race theory in 1994 as \"a collection of critical stances against the existing legal order from a race-based point of view\". \"Education Week\" describes the core of CRT as the idea that that race is a social construct and racism is neither an individual bias nor prejudiceit is \"embedded in the legal system\" and supplemented with policies and procedures.\nUniversity of Alabama School of Law professor Richard Delgado, a co-founder of critical race theory, defines it in 2017 as \"a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race, racism, and power\".\nGloria Ladson-Billings, a pedagogical theorist who introduced CRT to the field of education in 1994, describes CRT as an \"interdisciplinary approach that seeks to understand and combat race inequity in society.\"\nEarly years.\nDelgado and legal writer Jean Stefancic wrote an article in 1998 called \"Critical Race Theory: Past, Present, and Future.\" According to that article, CRT began with Derrick Bell in his 1976 \"Yale Law Journal\" article, \"Serving Two Masters\" and his 1980 \"Harvard Law Review\" article \"Brown v. Board of Education and the Interest-Convergence Dilemma.\" \nBell started out as a civil rights lawyer. He won 300 civil rights cases for the NAACP in Mississippi. Later, he worked as a professor at Harvard Law School. There, Bell made new classes about American law and how it worked with race.\nIn 2001, Delgado and Stefancic also wrote \"Critical Race Theory: a Introduction\". That book talked about Bell's \"interest convergence\" as a \"means of understanding Western racial history.\" The focus on desegregation after the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Educationdeclaring school segregation unconstitutionalleft \"civil-rights lawyers compromised between their clients' interests and the law.\" Many Black parents wanted better schools for their children but the lawyers wanted a \"breakthrough,\" a famous case that would change things for the whole country. In 1995, Cornel West said that Bell was \"virtually the lone dissenter\" because he wrote articles in famous law review publications challenging the ways people thought about the law and people of color. \nBell wrote his own material for the classes he taught. In 1970, he turned them into a book called \"Race, racism, and American law\". He became Harvard Law School's first Black tenured professor in 1971. In 1980, Bell resigned from the university because he thought it was doing racist things, and he became the dean at University of Oregon School of Law. Later, he went back to Harvard as a visiting professor. While he was away from Harvard, his supporters organized protests against Harvard's lack of racial diversity in the classes, student body, and teachers. In 1981, one student protest started a new class based on Bell's course and textbook. In that class, students brought in visiting professors, such as Charles Lawrence, Linda Greene, Neil Gotanda, and Richard Delgado, to teach \"Race, racism, and American law\". \nThe students asked faculty members who were people of color to teach the new courses. The university said no to the things the students wanted. They said there was no black instructor who was qualified to teach the course. Legal scholar Randall Kennedy wrote that some students had \"felt affronted\" by Harvard's choice to hire an \"archetypal white liberal... in a way that precludes the development of black leadership.\" \nDelgado and Stefancic said Alan Freeman, who wrote in the 1970s, was also part of the beginning of critical race theory. In his 1978 \"Minnesota Law Review\" article, Freeman wrote about the Supreme Court and civil rights laws from 1953 to 1969. He said their interpretation of the law was too narrow to stop racial discrimination. In his article, Freeman said there were two ways to look at racial discrimination: victim and perpetrator. To the victim, racial discrimination was about real-world conditions and about the \"consciousness associated with those objective conditions.\" To the perpetrator, racial discrimination was only about being able to perform actions without thining about the real-world conditions of the victims, such as the \"lack of jobs, lack of money, lack of housing.\" \nIn 1989, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, and Stephanie Phillips did a workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. They called it \"New Developments in Critical Race Theory.\" This was when people started calling it \"Critical Race Theory.\" They said it would be an \"intersection of critical theory and race, racism, and the law.\" Crenshaw chose Harvard to study under Bell because she had learned about him at Cornell. Crenshaw organized the alternative course using Bell's course materials. She was part of a group of students who considered themselves part of the \"post-civil rights generation\".\nAfter this meeting, legal scholars started writing more articles with critical race theory in them, including over \"300 leading law review articles\" and books. In 1990, Duncan Kennedy published an article about affirmative action in law schools in the \"Duke Law Journal\", and Anthony E. Cook published his article \"Beyond Critical Legal Studies\" in the \"Harvard Law Review\". In 1991, Patricia Williams published \"The Alchemy of Race and Rights\", while Derrick Bell published \"Faces at the Bottom of the Well\" in 1992. Cheryl I. Harris published her 1993 \"Harvard Law Review\" article \"Whiteness as Property\" in which she described how looking like a white person led to benefits similar to owning property. In 1995, 24 legal scholars contributed to a major compilation of key writings on critical race theory. \nAlthough CLS criticized the way the legal system had made and protected social structures that allowed racism or made it worse, CLS did not talk about how to solve this problems. Derrick Bell and Alan Freeman said that CLS could not provide solutions unless it talked about race and racism. CRT criticized CLS for focusing too much on class and economic structures and not enough on race. \nGrowth and expansion.\nIn 1995, Gloria Ladson-Billings and William F. Tate started using critical race theory in education. In an article they wrote in 1995, Ladson-Billings and Tate talked about why education focused on what white people think of as normal. They looked at how schooling was not always fair and equal. Other scholars have since spread this to school segregation in the U.S.; relations between race, gender, and academic achievement; pedagogy; and ways of studying social problems.\nAccording to University of Edinburgh philosophy professor, Tommy J. Curry, by 2009, many agreed with CRT's idea that race was socially constructed, not \"biologically grounded and natural.\" \"Social construct\" means that even though how much dark pigment different people have in their skin is a real thing, and which continent their ancestors came from is a real thing, whether or not those facts are important is made up by society. For example, money is a social construct. A round piece of metal is real. A piece of paper with ink on it is real. But societies decide whether the metal is a coin and whether the paper is paper money.\n, over 20 American law schools and at least three non-American law schools offered critical race theory courses or classes. Critical race theory is also used in education, political science, women's studies, ethnic studies, communication, sociology, and American studies. Critical race theory also works with specific groups, for example Latino-critical (LatCrit), queer-critical, and Asian-critical movements. These groups work with with the main body of critical theory research. Over time, they found their own goals and ways of finding information. CRT has also been taught outside the United States, including in the United Kingdom and Australia.\nCommon themes.\nRichard Delgado and Jean Stefancic say that critical race theory has several themes:\nInternalization.\nScholar Karen Pyke studied and wrote papers about internalized racism or internalized racial oppression. This is when people who suffer from racism start to believe that they are not as good as whites or that their culture is not as good as white culture. They think this not because they are less intelligent or easier to trick than other people are. Instead, it is because this is how authority and power in society make people feel.\nInstitutional racism.\nCamara Phyllis Jones defines institutionalized racism like this:\nIn other words, institutionalized racism is when the society is set up to help some people more than others and hurt some people more than others and it isn't always easy to see this happening. With institutionalized racism, a white person does not need to do anything racist to a non-white person. The rules of the society do it for them. For example, the schools in white neighborhoods might have more and newer computers than the schools in black neighborhoods, which means the white schoolchildren will get better grades even if the black schoolchildren work just as hard. The people at the white school might not know that the people at the black school have worse computers. In English, we say this as, \"this is not a level playing field.\"\nInfluence of critical legal studies.\nCritical race theory is like critical theory, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, and postcolonial theory. Tommy J. Curry wrote that the epistemic ways in which these ways of thinking are similar come from idealism. Idealism is about discourse (i.e., how individuals speak about race) and the theories of white Continental philosophers and the way they talk about structural and institutional stories about white supremacy. These ways of speaking and thinking are important to realist analysis of racism from Derrick Bell's early writing. Black thinkers, for example, W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, and Judge Robert L. Carter wrote about them even more.\nCritical race theory uses the things critical legal studies says are important. It also uses ways of looking at things from critical legal studies and civil rights scholarship, but it also argues with them. Critical race theory takes its theory from many places. Angela P. Harris says critical race theory has the same \"commitment to a vision of liberation from racism through right reason\" as civil rights tradition. It deconstructs some premises and arguments of legal theory and simultaneously holds that legally constructed rights are incredibly important. Derrick Bell says that Harris thinks critical race theory is committed to \"radical critique of the law (which is normatively deconstructionist) and... radical emancipation by the law (which is normatively reconstructionist).\"\nApplications.\nScholars of critical race theory have used it to look at hate crime and hate speech. The U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling on hate speech in \"R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul\" in 1992. In that ruling, the Court struck down an anti-bias ordinance. In that case, a teenager who had burned a cross. Mari Matsuda and Charles Lawrence argued that the Court had not looked closely at the history of racist speech and the actual injury that racist speech can cause.\nCritical race theorists also say affirmative action is good. They say that rules for whom to fire or whom to let into a good school that are officially based only on \"merit,\" for example grades alone, are not really race-neutral.\nCriticism.\nAcademics and jurists.\nAccording to the \"Encyclopedia Britannica\", \"aspects of CRT have been criticized by legal scholars and jurists from across the political spectrum.\" Critics say it has a \"postmodern way of looking at the truth. It also says critical race theory opposes \"the traditional liberal ideals of neutrality, equality, and fairness in the law and legal procedures and of unreasonably spurning the notion of objective standards of merit in academia and in public and private employment, instead interpreting any racial inequity or imbalance in legal, academic, or economic outcomes as proof of institutional racism and as grounds for directly imposing racially equitable outcomes in those realms.\" People who want to use CRT have also been accused of calling criticism of CRT racist.\nIn 1997, law professors Daniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry said that critical race theory did not have enough evidence to support it. Instead, they said, it was based on the belief that reality was a socially construct, that it pushed away evidence to use storytelling instead, rejected truth and merit as ways of looking at political dominance, and rejected the rule of law. In 1995, Farber and Sherry wrote that anti-meritocratic tenets in critical race theory, critical feminism, and critical legal studies may unintentionally lead to antisemitic and anti-Asian implications. They wrote in 1997 that if the system really is unfair in its structure the way critical race theorists say it is, then the success of Jews and Asians might make people say they cheated. In 2017, Delgado and Stefancic wrote a response: They said that there was a difference between criticizing an unfair system and criticizing individuals who do well inside that system.\nIn a 1999 \"Boston College Law Review\" article called \"Race, Equality and the Rule of Law: Critical Race Theory's Attack on the Promises of Liberalism\", First Amendment lawyer Jeffrey J. Pyle said that critical race theory undermined confidence in the rule of law. He wrote that \"critical race theorists attack the very foundations of the liberal legal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism and neutral principles of constitutional law.\"\nPolitical controversies.\nCritical race theory inspired many arguments in the United States. The first were in the 1980s. People argued about the way critical race theory questioned color blindness. Color blindness, in this article, means the idea that one person can completely ignore another person's race and treat them fairly no matter what. People also argued about how critical race theory used narrative in legal studies, advocating \"legal instrumentalism\" instead of ideal-driven uses of the law. People also argued about how critical race theory looked at the U.S. Constitution and other laws and they way they hleped white people keep power over other people. People also argued about how critical race theory encourages legal scholars to work for racial equity. One example of an instrumentalist approach is when lawyer Johnnie Cochran's defended O. J. Simpson in the O. J. Simpson murder case. Cochran told the jury to say Simpson was not guilty of killing his ex wife and her friend, even though there was evidence against him as payback for the way the United States and the Los Angeles Police department had treated black people. This was a form of jury nullification. Before and after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump opposed the teaching of critical race theory in schools as part of his platform. Other conservative politicians did so too on Fox News and right-wing radio shows.\n1990s.\nWhen Bill Clinton nominated Lani Guinier for Assistant Attorney General, Republicans said she should not get the job. One of their reasons was that she supported CRT. Clinton withdrew the nomination due to disagreements with her legal philosophy.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, a state law stopped a Mexican-American studies university program in Tucson, Arizona because it said public schools could not teach race-conscious education by \"advocat[ing] ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.\" The law banned books, including a book about CRT, from the school. State officials banned Matt de la Pe\u00f1a's young-adult novel \"Mexican WhiteBoy\" because they said it contained critical race theory. The rules against ethnic-studies programs were later declared unconstitutional because lawyers were able to prove that the state had meant to discriminate against some groups of people on purpose: \"Both enactment and enforcement were motivated by racial animus,\" federal Judge A. Wallace Tashima ruled.\n2020s.\nAustralia.\nIn June 2021, the media reported that the proposed lessons for Australia's schools was \"preoccupied with the oppression, discrimination and struggles of Indigenous Australians.\" The Australian Senate approved a motion from right-wing senator Pauline Hanson asking the federal government to not use CRT, even though there was no CRT in in the lessons.\nUnited Kingdom.\nConservatives in the government of the United Kingdom began to criticize CRT in late 2020. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, who is of Nigerian descent, said during a parliamentary debate to mark Black History Month:\nIn an interview in \"The Spectator\", Badenoch said, \"many of these booksand, in fact, some of the authors and proponents of critical race theoryactually want a segregated society.\" 101 writers from the Black Writers' Guild responded in an open letter, telling Badenoch she was wrong to criticize books like \"White Fragility\" and \"Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race\".\nUnited States.\n\"The Washington Post\" says that conservative lawmakers and other conservatives have used the term \"critical race theory\" as a \"catchall phrase for nearly any examination of systemic racism.\" In September 2020, conservative activist Christopher Rufo denounced CRT on Fox News, and then Donald Trump issued an executive order saying the United States federal government must cancel funding for programs that talk about \"white privilege\" or \"critical race theory.\" President Trump said that this was because critical race theory was \"divisive, un-American propaganda\" and \"racist.\" Rufo wrote on Twitter, \"The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory,'\" meaning that conservatives were trying to trick the public into thinking critical race theory was bad.\nIn a speech on September 17, 2020, Trump said critical race theory was bad. He said he had formed the 1776 Commission to promote \"patriotic education.\" On January 20, 2021, Joe Biden took back Trump's order and ended the 1776 Commission. Conservative think tanks and other conservative groups continued to work on opposition to both actual critical race theory and what they mistakenly thought was critical race theory. These groups include the Heritage Foundation, the Idaho Freedom Foundation, and the American Legislative Exchange Council.\nIn early 2021, potential laws were started. These laws would limit the teaching of critical race theory in public schools in Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. Several of these bills used the words \"critical race theory\" or talked about the \"New York Times\" 1619 Project. In mid-April 2021, a bill was introduced to the Idaho legislature that would have banned any educational entity in the state (schools and other things like schools) from teaching or advocating sectarianism, including critical race theory and other social justice programs. On May 4, 2021, the bill was signed into law by Governor Brad Little. On June 10, 2021, every member of the Florida State Board of Education voted to stop public schools from teaching critical race theory. They did this because governor Ron DeSantis asked them to. As of July 2021, 10 U.S. states have introduced bills or done other things that would limit teaching critical race theory, and 26 others were in the process of doing so. In June 2021, the American Association of University Professors, the American Historical Association, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and PEN America released a joint paper saying that these laws were bad. By August 2021, 167 professional organizations had signed the statement. In August 2021, the Brookings Institution recorded that eight statesIdaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, and South Carolinahad passed laws on the critical race theory, though they also noted that none of the bills had passed, with the exception of Idaho's, actually contained the words \"critical race theory.\" Brookings also noted that these laws often also stop teaching about gender. Critics called the state laws a memory law and said that the law banning critical race theory was proof that critical race theory was right: that racism is part of the law in the United States.\nSubfields.\nThere are smaller groups in critical race theory for different communities of people. These groups look at race and the way it affects disability, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and religion. For example, disability critical race studies (DisCrit), critical race feminism (CRF), Hebrew Crit (HebCrit), Black Critical Race Theory (Black Crit), Latino critical race studies (LatCrit), Asian American critical race studies (AsianCrit), South Asian American critical race studies (DesiCrit), and American Indian critical race studies, which is sometimes called TribalCrit. The methods developed for CRT have also been used to studying groups of white immigrants. In response to CRT, some scholars have asked for a second wave of whiteness studies. It is called Second Wave Whiteness (SWW). Critical race theory has also inspired scholars to study race outside the United States.\nDisability critical race theory.\ndisability critical race studies (DisCrit) combines disability studies and CRT to look at the intersection of disability and race. This means the way race and disability affect each other.\nLatino critical race theory.\nLatino critical race theory (LatCRT or LatCrit) is a research framework that talks about the way society defines race. Latino critical race theory says this is important to how people of color are oppressed in society. Race scholars developed LatCRT as a critical response to the \"problem of the color line\" first explained by W. E. B. Du Bois. While CRT focuses on the Black\u2013White paradigm, LatCRT has moved to consider other racial groups, mainly Chicana/Chicanos, as well as Latinos/as, Asians, Native Americans/First Nations, and women of color.\nIn \"Critical Race Counterstories along the Chicana/Chicano Educational Pipeline\", Tara J. Yosso discusses how the limits placed on POC can be defined. The tenets that separate such individuals are the intercentricity of race and racism, the problem of dominant ideology, the commitment to social justice, the centrality of experience knowledge, and the way of looking at things that uses many types of scholarship.\nLatCRT's main focus is to work for social justice for people living in communities that have been pushed to the edges of society (specifically Chicana/os). Chicanos are Mexican-Americans. Society has placed limits on them that put them at a disadvantage, like with other people of color. Social institutions act to dispossess Chicanos, stop them from voting, and discriminate against them. LatCRT seeks to give voice to those who are victimized. In order to do so, LatCRT has created two common themes:\nFirst, CRT says society keeps white supremacy and racial power in place; they do not stay there on their own. The law is a big part of keeping them where they are. Some racial groups do not have the voice to speak in this civil society. Because of this, CRT introduced a new form of expression, called the \"voice of color\". The \"voice of color\" is narratives and storytelling monologues used as devices for conveying personal racial experiences. These are also used to counter metanarratives that continue to maintain racial inequality. In this way, the experiences of the oppressed are important parts of developing a LatCRT analytical approach.\nSecond, LatCRT investigates the possibility of transforming the relationship between law enforcement and racial power and working for racial emancipation and an end to some groups being pushed around. LatCRT is different from general critical race theory in that it talks more about immigration theory and policy, language rights, and the way people are discriminated against for having accents or ancestors from other countries. CRT finds the experiential knowledge of people of color and works with their lived experience using data. LatCRT shows its research using many kinds of stories.\nAsian critical race theory.\nAsian critical race theory looks at the way race and racism affect Asian Americans and their experiences in the U.S. education system. Like Latino critical race theory, Asian critical race theory is distinct from the main body of CRT in its emphasis on immigration theory and policy."}

It features the voices of Brady Noon, Ethan William Childress, and Chris Diamantopoulos.\n\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" is produced by 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Animation and Color Force, and is set to be released on Disney+ as a Disney+ original film on December 3, 2021. It will be the second 20th Century Studios film to be released as a Disney+ original film (the first being \"Home Sweet Home Alone\"), the first \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" film to be fully animated and the first to be produced under Disney ownership, the second animated film to be produced by 20th Century Animation and distributed by 20th Century Studios since the closure of Blue Sky Studios in April 2021, following \"Ron's Gone Wrong\", and the first 20th Century Studios animated film to be released on Disney+.\nAdditionally, it is the first 20th Century Studios film to be marketed under the Disney brand, as seen on the film's logo.\nProduction.\nFollowing the release of ', the likelihood of a fourth live-action film was slim.

In an interview for ', Kinney stated he was working with Fox on a half-hour special based on \"Cabin Fever\", which was scheduled to air in late-2014. Though the special never came to fruition, a new project was announced in August 2018. CEO of 20th Century Fox Stacey Snider stated that an animated television series based on \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" was in development, after Kinney decided not to allow any more live action adaptations of the series. In August 2019 after the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the project was confirmed to be still in development exclusively for streaming on Disney+.\nIn December 2020, the project was confirmed to have been redeveloped as an animated reboot feature film simply titled, \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" at the 2020 Disney Investor Day event. Alongside this announcement, it was revealed that production was underway with a tentative release date slated for mid-2021. By September 2021, it was announced that the film would be an adaptation of the first book in the series; while the film is scheduled for a December 3, 2021 release date. Swinton Scott was announced as director, with a script written by Kinney who will also serve as producer. Brady Noon, Ethan William Childress, and Chris Diamantopoulos serve as the voice cast. John Paesano will serve as composer.\nAnimation services were provided by Bardel Entertainment.\nMarketing.\nThe teaser poster was revealed on September 2, 2021 (the same day the release date was announced). The film has been marketed under the Disney brand, similar to Disney+ original series produced by 20th Television, such as \"Turner &amp; Hooch\", \"The Mysterious Benedict Society\", and \"Just Beyond\". This has led to speculations that Walt Disney Pictures was involved in the film. The first official trailer was released on October 19, 2021 by Walt Disney Studios' YouTube channel (the YouTube channel for Walt Disney Pictures), further increasing speculations.\nAdditionally, a reprint of the original book will feature a new Disney+ cover variant to serve as a tie-in release to the movie. This book featured a first-look at Rowley Jefferson in his CG-animated form. Like the original book, it will be published under Amulet Books, but this time, in-association with Disney Enterprises, Inc.

It has the farthest north point on Earth, or the point closest to the North Pole.\nDiscovery.\nAmerican explorer Robert Peary saw Kaffeklubben Island in 1900. This was the first time anyone saw the island. However, he did not visit the island. Nobody visited it until 1921, when the Danish explorer Lauge Koch visited the island and gave it its name. It was named after the coffee club in the University of Copenhagen Geological Museum.\nIn 1969, a Canadian team found that the farthest north point on the island was farther north than Cape Morris Jesup, the farthest north point on mainland Greenland. Because of this, Kaffeklubben Island has the record for having the farthest north point on land.\nSince then, many deposits of gravel have been found in the sea to the north of the island, such as Oodaaq, 83-42, and ATOW1996. However, they are not permanent. They are usually absorbed by moving ice sheets, move around because of the tides, or sink into the ocean.\nGeography.\nKaffeklubben Island is from the North Pole. The island is near Cape James Hill, northwest of Bliss Bay, about east of Cape Morris Jesup. Its farthest north point is 4.4 km north of the farthest north point of Cape Morris Jesup. It is about long, and about across at its widest point. The highest point is about above sea level.\nEnvironment.\nNot many things can survive on the island. However, some plants grow on Kaffeklubben Island, including mosses, liverworts, lichens, and the flowering plants \"Saxifraga oppositifolia\" (purple saxifrage) and \"Papaver radicatum\" (arctic poppy)."}

They can be traded between memory cards.\nReception.\nMetacritic says the game is mostly enjoyed, but not as much as the previous two \"Monster Rancher\" games. Eric Bratcher of \"Next Generation\" said it is \"A unique, absorbing game that needs to expand its vision in order to live up to its revolutionary roots.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 29 out of 40."}

He lived in Japan during the Edo period. He is popular for his writings on Tokyo. He is also known as Yagozaemon.\nEarly life.\nTerakado was born in Mito Domain in 1796. His father was a minor government official. When Terakado was 13 years old, his father died. After his father's death he lived an unpleasant lifestyle. In his late twenties, he turned to Confucianism and opened a school. Like his father, he held a minor position as a samurai. He studied Chinese poetry under Ryokuin Yamamoto.\nCareer.\nIn 1831 he wrote a series of essays titled . The essays were compiled as a book and published in 1838. His essays got fame as well as scrutiny from Edo officials. The essays were banned by Edo officials in 1835. After publication the woodblocks were confiscated in 1842. At the same time Terakado was also banned from being an official. After losing his position as a samurai, Terakado wandered Japan. He worked as a schoolteacher and writer. He died on 16 April 1868.\n\"Edo Hanjoki\" was a very critical social satire of the Tokugawa government. He wrote most of the essays in literary kanbun. Kanbun was mostly used in government documents. This brought an additional seriousness to his writings. Whenever he wrote about wealthier districts like Honjo, he usually focused on unpleasant places such as brothels. He compared the upper and lower classes to expose economic inequalities within the Tokugawa government. The \"Edo Hanjoki\" influenced upcoming generations of social critics and writers. His other works include \"Niigata Hanjoki\" and \"Essay of Seiken\".\nTerakado's work was mostly written by the scholar Andrew L. Markus."}

Hult is named for the school's benefactor Bertil Hult.\nHult offers undergraduate, master's, and MBA degree programs, as well as executive education through Ashridge Executive Education, housed on the Ashridge Estate campus.\nHult is the successor of the Arthur D. Little School of Management, founded in 1964 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and of the Ashridge Business School, founded in 1959 in Ashridge, England.\nThe school is patron to the Hult Prize, a student entrepreneur competition.\nHistory.\nThe \"Arthur D. Little School of Management\" was founded in 1964 by Arthur Dehon Little in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally developed as an executive management education program, the school began to grant degrees after receiving full accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges in 1976. In 1996, the Arthur D. Little School of Management formed a partnership with Boston College's Carroll School of Management in order to share access to faculty and facilities.\nIn 2002, Swedish billionaire Bertil Hult purchased the Arthur D. Little School of Management, which became Hult International Business School in 2003. Under its restructuring, Hult established a new curriculum oriented on international business, which led to the establishment of Hult's global campuses in Dubai (2008), San Francisco (2010), Shanghai (2011), and New York (2014).\nCampuses.\nHult maintains 7 campuses across 6 countries and serves approximately 3,000 students: two undergraduate and postgraduate campuses (London and Boston), three postgraduate campuses that serve as summer rotational campuses (San Francisco, Shanghai and Dubai) one solely postgraduate campuses (New York City), and one executive education campus (Ashridge Estate in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). Students are encouraged to rotate between campuses during their programs.\nThe Hult London Undergraduate Campus, built by British firm Sergison Bates Architects, won the Royal Institute of British Architects National Award in 2015.\nAcademics.\nRankings.\nHult's Master of International Business program was ranked #17 in The Economist's ranking of Masters in Management programs worldwide in 2019.\nIn 2020, Hult's Ashridge Executive Education was ranked #16 in the Financial Times Executive Education Top 50 Schools list.\nHult Prize.\nHult International Business School is the sponsor of the \"Hult Prize\" (before called \"Hult Global Case Challenge\"), an annual competition launched in 2010 where students have to find business solutions. The Prize is a partnership between Hult International Business School, the Clinton Global Initiative, and the United Nations Foundation.\nThe best teams from each regional event advance to a global final, at which a single winning team is chosen.

The town was originally a small fishing village situated on marshland, but at the end of the 19th century, it grew into a tourist destination. A number of Liberty-style villas on the seafront promenade have made it one of the gems of Art Nouveau in Europe.\nHistory.\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, Mondello was an unhealthy marsh enclosed by two headlands: the Mount Pellegrino described by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as \"the most beautiful promontory in the world\" and Mount Gallo. \nAt some point, a Palermitan nobleman had the idea to drain the swamp. Prince Francesco Lanza di Scalea, with the help of a Belgian real estate company, built a plant for the drainage of swampy waters to the sea. The newly rehabilitated areas, previously occupied by the swamp, underwent a process of expansion and evolution from the 18th to the 20th centuries.\nFrom 1912 onwards, Mondello became the seat of the high bourgeoisie and the aristocracy. The nobility of the city fostered the construction of several exclusive and aristocratic circles, the construction of villas, and the exploitation of lush gardens. King Ferdinand of Bourbon called it \"a corner of paradise\". Eventually, the beach of Mondello was born.\nAttractions.\nMondello is characterized by a sandy bay that binds the two promontories, called Monte Gallo and Mount Pellegrino, with a coastline of white sand that nowadays is approximately 1.5 kilometers long. The Natural Reserve of Capo Gallo and the reserve of Monte Pellegrino are nearby. Today the area is known for its beach and for its Art Nouveau villas, which characterize the architecture of the borough, making it a landmark in the history of international modernism."}

She is known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China.\nDuring the An Lushan Rebellion, Emperor Xuanzong and his men were moving from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu. At that time, the emperor's guards demanded that he should kill Yang. It was because they blamed the rebellion on her cousin Yang Guozhong and the rest of her family. The emperor tried to stop this but he failed. So, he ordered his attendant Gao Lishi to kill Yang by strangling.\nBackground.\nYang was born in 719 during the Tang Dynasty, early in the time of Emperor Xuanzong. Her great-great-grandfather Yang Wang () was an important official during the time of Emperor Yang of Sui. After the fall of the Sui Dynasty, he served as one of the competitors to succeed Sui, Wang Shichong. Yang Wang was then killed when Wang Shichong was defeated by Tang forces in 621. Yang Wang was from Huayin (; in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), but his clan relocated to Yongle (; in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi).\nYang's father Yang Xuanyan () served as a census official at Shu Prefecture (; in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). His family went there with him. He had no sons, but had four daughters. These daughters were known to history as Yang Yuhuan and three older sisters. Yang Xuanyan died when Yang Yuhuan was still young. So, the latter was raised by her uncle Yang Xuanjiao (). Her uncle who was a low-ranking official at Henan Municipality (; modern Luoyang).\nPrincess and Taoist nun.\nIn 733, fourteen-year-old Yang Yuhuan married Li Mao. Li Mao was the Prince of Shou and the son of Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Wu. Yang had the title of Princess of Shou. After Consort Wu died in 737, Emperor Xuanzong was very sad by the death of his then-favorite wife. Some time after that, Princess Yang came into Xuanzong's favor. So, the Emperor decided to take her as his wife. But, since Princess Yang was already the wife of his son, Emperor Xuanzong arranged her to become a Taoist nun. With the name Taizhen to avoid bad fame from the people, he planned of making her his wife. Yang stayed for a some time as a Taoist nun in the palace itself. Emperor Xuanzong made her an imperial consort after marrying a new wife for his son Li Mao. Yang became the favorite wife of the Emperor.\nImperial consort.\nIn 745, Emperor Xuanzong gave the daughter of the general Wei Zhaoxun () to Li Mao as his new wife and princess. Then, he officially made Taizhen an imperial consort. She was given the rank of \"Guifei\", that was greater than the previously highest rank of \"Huifei\", took by Consort Wu. He gave honors on her dead father Yang Xuanyan and granted her mother the title of Lady of Liang. He also gave high offices to her uncle Yang Xuangui () and cousins Yang Xian () and Yang Qi (). Her three elder sisters were given the ranks of Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin. Whenever the noble women were invited to imperial meetings, even Emperor Xuanzong's highly honored sister Li Chiying (), the Princess Yuzhen, did not dare to take a seat more respectful than theirs. Emperor Xuanzong also married his favorite daughter Princess Taihua (born of Consort Wu) to Yang Qi. The five Yang family members\u2014those of Yang Xian, Yang Qi, and the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin\u2014were said to be honored very much. All of the officials tried to praise them.\nAt the same time, Consort Yang introduced her second cousin Yang Zhao (whose name was later changed to Yang Guozhong) to Emperor Xuanzong. Yang Zhao praised the emperor. So, his position rose quickly. \nConsort Yang was so favored that whenever she rode a horse, the eunuch Gao Lishi would take her care. 700 workers were engaged to sew clothes for her. Officials and generals praised her by offering her many tributes. In 746, she made Emperor Xuanzong angry by being jealous and rude to him. So, he had sent her to Yang Xian's house. Later, he could not eat anything, and he blamed his servants for smaller offenses. Gao knew that he missed Consort Yang. So, he requested the Emperor to send all the treasures in Consort Yang's palace to her. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and sent imperial meals to her as well. That night, Gao requested the Emperor Xuanzong to welcome Consort Yang back to the palace. It was readily accepted by Emperor Xuanzong. Thereafter, she was even more favored, and no other imperial consort could have his favor.\nIn 747, when the military governor (\"jiedushi\") An Lushan came to the capital Chang'an to meet Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong showed him much favor and allowed him into the palace. He had an honor from Consort Yang as a mother. He was also respected by Consort Yang's cousins and sisters as his brothers and sisters.\nIn 750, Consort Yang again made Emperor Xuanzong angry with her words. He sent her back to her clan. The official Ji Wen () told Emperor Xuanzong that he had overreacted. Emperor Xuanzong regretted for his actions. He again sent imperial meals to her. She wept to the eunuchs delivering the meal.\nShe cut off some of her hair. She send the hair back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong sent Gao to escort her back to the palace. After this, he even love her more than ever.\nIn 751, An Lushan again visited Chang'an. On An's birthday on 20 February, 751, Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Yang gave award to him with clothing, treasures, and food. On 23 February, when An was called to the palace, Consort Yang, pleased Emperor Xuanzong. She had an very big child wrapping and wrapped the obese An in it. This caused much laughter among the ladies in waiting and eunuchs. When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang's attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days before and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong was amused by the funny situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed freedom to the palace. And there were false news that he and Consort Yang had an affair. But Emperor Xuanzong stopped the false news.\nConsort Yang's cousin, Yang Guozhen, had been serving as commander of Jiannan Circuit (; headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). In 752, following Nanzhao incursions against Jiannan Circuit, chancellor Li Linfu wanted to send Yang Guozhong to Jiannan to personally control defense against the Nanzhao attacks. Consort Yang supported Yang Guozhong. Yang Guozhong did not actually report to Jiannan. Li Linfu soon died, and Yang Guozhong became chancellor.\nAn Lushan's rebellion and Consort Yang's death.\nYang Guozhong and An Lushan soon were in conflict. Yang Guozhong repeatedly acted badly. For example, he was capturing and killing staff members from An's house in Chang'an.\nIn 755, An finally rebelled and marched his armies toward the capital. In order to try to control the public, Yang Guozhong's conflict with An Lushan had started the rebellion. Emperor Xuanzong thought of passing the throne to his crown prince, Li Heng. Yang Guozhong, who was not on having good relationship with the prince, feared this development. He requested Consort Yang and her sisters, the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin, to speak against it. Emperor Xuanzong did not leave the throne.\nIn 756, Yang Guozhong forced General Geshu Han to engage An Lushan. This was because of fear that the general himself might attempt to claim the throne. Geshu Han was defeated. Tong Pass, the last major imperial defense, fell to An's forces. Yang Guozhong suggested for fleeing to Chengdu, the capital of Jiannan Circuit. On 14 July, Emperor Xuanzong, along with Consort Yang, her family, and his immediate clan members, secretly left Chang'an. They were going to Chengdu. He was accompanied by Yang Guozhong, his fellow chancellor Wei Jiansu, the official Wei Fangjin (), the general Chen Xuanli, and some eunuchs and ladies in waiting close to him.\nOn 15 July, Emperor Xuanzong's possession reached Mawei Courier Station (, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The imperial guards were hungry and angry at Yang Guozhong. Tibetan emissaries, who had followed the emperor, were also complaining to Yang Guozhong that they had not been fed. General Chen Xuanli believed that Yang Guozhong's actions had started this bad events. The General reported to Li Heng that he planned to accuse Yang Guozhong.\nSoldiers of the imperial guard declared that Yang Guozhong was planning with the Tibetan emissaries. They killed Yang Guozhong, his son Yang Xuan (), Consort Yang's sisters, the ladies of Han and Qin, and Wei Fangjin. (Wei Jiansu was severely injured and nearly killed, but was spared at the last moment.) Yang Guozhong's wife Pei Rou () and his son Yang Xi (), along with Consort Yang's sister, the Lady of Guo, and her son Pei Hui () tried to escape, but were killed. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong's place. They refused to leave even after the Emperor came out to comfort them and ordered them to go.\nEmperor Xuanzong then sent Gao Lishi to ask General Chen Xuanli for his advice. Chen's reply was that the Emperor should kill Consort Yang. Initially the Emperor refused, but after Wei E (, Wei Jiansu's son) and Gao Lishi spoke in agreement with Chen, the Emperor later agreed. Gao take Consort Yang to a Buddhist shrine and strangled her. When Consort Yang's body was shown to Chen and the other imperial guard generals, the soldiers went away and prepared to continue the journey. Consort Yang was buried at Mawei, without a coffin. But she was buried with masses of fragrance wrapped in purple blankets.\nIn 757, Prince Li Heng had taken the throne as Emperor Suzong. He recaptured Chang'an and welcomed ex-Emperor Xuanzong, then \"Taishang Huang\" (retired emperor) back to the capital. Emperor Xuanzong went through Mawei on his way back to Chang'an. He wanted to locate Consort Yang's body and rebury her with honor. The official Li Kui spoke against it. He pointed out that the imperial guard might again stand against it if he did so. However, Emperor Xuanzong secretly sent eunuchs to rebury her with a coffin. When they found the body, it was already decomposed. But the fragrance bag buried with her was still fresh. The eunuchs returned with the fragrance bag, and upon its presentation to Emperor Xuanzong, he cried so much. When he returned to Chang'an, a painter created a picture of Consort Yang in a secondary palace. And he often went there to see the portrait.\nPersonal characteristics.\nYang was known for having a larger figure, in a time of Chinese history where such body types were wanted so much. Because of that, Yang is often compared and contrasted with Empress Zhao Feiyan, who is known for being a slender person. This, in turn, led to the four-character idiom \"huanfei yanshou\" (). This describes the physical range of the types of beauties between Zhao and Yang."}
