He is most famous for his invention of the theremin, one of the first electronic musical instruments.\nL\u00e9on Theremin was born in Saint Petersburg - renamed Leningrad from 1924 until 1991 - and his family had French ancestry.\nBiography.\nEarly inventions.\nHe invented the theremin (also called the \"thereminvox\") in 1919, when his country was in the midst of the Russian Civil War. Theremin also invented the first electronic burglar alarm, which he called a \"radio watchman\".\nMove to the United States.\nTheremin moved to the United States, arriving December 30, 1927 with his first wife, Katia Constantinova. He performed the theremin with the New York Philharmonic in 1928. He patented his invention in the United States in 1928 and subsequently granted commercial production rights to RCA. Theremin set up a laboratory in New York in the 1930s, where he developed the theremin and experimented with other electronic musical instruments and other inventions.\nTheremin was interested in a role for the theremin in dance music. He developed performance locations that could automatically react to dancers' movements with varied patterns of sound and light. He worked with the American Negro Ballet. After the Soviet consulate had apparently demanded he divorce Katia, the inventor fell in love with and married the young prima ballerina Lavinia Williams. His marriage to the African-American dancer caused shock and disapproval in his social circles, but the couple remained together.\nReturn to the Soviet Union.\nTheremin abruptly returned to the Soviet Union in 1938. At the time, the reasons for his return were not clear. Some claimed that he was simply homesick, while others believed that he had been kidnapped by Soviet officials. Beryl Campbell, one of Theremin's dancers, said his wife Lavinia \"called to say that he had been kidnapped from his studio\" and that \"some Russians had come in\" and that she felt that he was going to be spirited out of the country.\nTheremin was put to work in a secret research and development laboratories in the Soviet Gulag labor camp system. Theremin created the \"Buran\" eavesdropping system which recorded conversations in French and American embassies by measuring the window glass vibrations using a low power infrared beam from a distance. Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB then used Buran to spy on US, British and French embassies.\nIn 1945 Theremin invented the first covert listening device (or \"bug\") for spying. Theremin's device was embedded in a carved wooden plaque of the Great Seal of the United States. On August 4, 1945, Soviet school children presented the bugged carving to U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman, as a \"gesture of friendship\" to the USSR's World War II ally. It hung in the ambassador\u2019s Moscow office until 1952, when the bug was discovered by a British radio operator who heard conversations on an open radio channel. The CIA found the device in the Great Seal carving. Peter Wright, a scientist and former MI5 counterintelligence officer, eventually figured out how it worked.\nLater life.\nAfter his release from the labor camp in 1947, Theremin volunteered to remain working with the KGB until 1966. By 1947 Theremin had remarried, to Maria, and they had two children: Lena and Natalia.\nAfter working for the KGB, Theremin worked at the Moscow Conservatory of Music for 10 years where he taught and built Theremins, electronic cellos and some Terpsitones. There he was discovered by a visiting New York Times correspondent, but when an article by Christopher Walker appeared, according to Lydia, the Vice President of the conservatory said \"The people don't need electronic music. Electricity is for killing traitors in the electric chair\", fired Theremin, closed his laboratory and had his instruments destroyed.\nAfter 51 years in the Soviet Union L\u00e9on Theremin started travelling, first visiting France in June 1989 and then the United States in 1991, each time accompanied by his daughter Natalia, where he was reunited with Clara Rockmore who performed a number of concerts at this time. He also made a demonstration concert at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague in early 1993 before dying in Moscow in 1993 at the age of 97.\nDocumentary film.\nL\u00e9on Theremin is the subject of the documentary movie, \"\", written, directed, and produced by Steven M. Martin. The documentary was a winner at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994. The movie features legendary thereminists Clara Rockmore and Lydia Kavina as well as electronic instrument pioneer Robert Moog, Nicolas Slonimsky, The Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson, and Theremin himself."}

The cloth was sewn very little, or not at all. The cloth was then put around the body and held in place by belts, fibulae, or other fastenings. The cloth was made from linen or wool.\nTypes of clothing.\nPeplos.\nThe peplos (plural: \"peploi\") was a garment worn by women of ancient Greece. The peplos was a large square piece of cloth. The cloth was then folded over to create a double layer, called \"apoptygma\", in the upper part of the body. The cloth is then folded around the body, and fastened over each shoulder. \nThe \"ionic\" or \"laconic peplos\" was open on the side of the body, while the \"doric peplos\" was sewn shut like a tube. The peplos was worn in such a way that the opening was on the right side of the body. Usually a belt was worn over the peplos. The belt could be worn over or under the \"apoptygma\". \nIn Greece, the peplos was mostly worn before the 5th century.\nChiton.\nThe chiton was made from a large square piece of cloth. It was worn by both women and men.\nThe \"doric chiton\" was very simple. It was made with a large piece of cloth (usually wool). The cloth was folded and put around the body. It was fastened on the shoulders using brooches and then allowed to fall into folds. A belt, often called a \"gurdle\", was worn around the waist to hold the dress in place.\nThe \"ionic chiton\" was sewn like a tube. The material, usually linen, was folded and sewn with holes left for the head and arms. A belt was also worn on the Ionic style to keep it in position and to make it fall into folds from the waist down.\nHimation.\nThe himation (plural: \"himatia\") was a big cloth that was used as a cloak. It was worn by both men and women. The himation was usually put from the back over the left shoulder; the other part of the himation was put under the right arm, and then around the front of the body. The himation was so long that it went down to the knees, or it could also be longer. \nThe himation was usually made from a lighter cloth, so that it was used as a cloak against warm weather.\nChlamys.\nThe chlamys (plural: \"chlamydes\") was a usually shorter cloak. It was a piece of cloth put over the left shoulder, and fastened over the right shoulder. The chlamys was typically worn by men or soldiers.\nWomen's clothing.\nWomen in Ancient Greece wore long dresses and cloaks. They wore the peplos and chiton, and the himation.\nCosmetics and make-up.\nCosmetics and make-up were not used in Ancient Greece. White lead was used to whiten the skin. White skin for women was seen as a sign of beauty. Juice made from alkanet roots was used to give the cheeks a rosy colour (like rouge). Eye shadow (probably made from ashes) was not used. Lipstick was not used. Perfumes were also important.\nMale clothing.\nMen's clothing was even simpler than women's (if anything). The most important piece of clothing was a shorter version of the chiton, which was also belted at the waist. The top shoulder was often left bare if the man was exercising or doing hard work. The himation was also used, especially on long journeys. A long robe could also be worn with the right shoulder left uncovered. Men usually wore no clothes training for military reasons.They wore no clothes when exercising\nShoes.\nAt home people went without shoes, but in the streets or when travelling they wore leather sandals. These were very simple and usually made to measure - the man or woman went to the cobbler's shop and put his foot on a piece of leather, and the sole was cut out round the foot. The sole was attached to the foot by leather thongs tied across the instep and round the ankle."}

She had been in prison for improper behaviour in court since 5 August 2011. Tymoshenko appealed against the sentence on 24 October 2011; she said the sentence was an act of revenge by Viktor Yanukovych (he has said it is not). The European Union and Russia protested against the sentence.\nTymoshenko's first name is sometimes spelled Yuliya, Yulia, Iulia, or Julia."}

They are not controlled by the Federal Government or the State Governments. There are laws which say what sort of cases the courts can hear and pass judgment on, and what type of punishment a court can give. But no law or minister can say that a person is guilty. Only the courts can do this.\nProtection.\nCourts give protection to ordinary people from bad governments, they are also protected from bad governments themselves.\nProtection of people by the courts.\nGermany has had free courts for longer than it has been a democracy, although under the Nazis many judges ignored the law and did what the Nazi Party wanted. This is why they were tried at the Nuremberg Judges Trial\nGermany is a \"Rechtsstaat\". That means it is a government based on law. All citizens are guaranteed to be equal, and government decisions can be challenged in court.\nNo law or minister can say that a person, or group of people is guilty.\nProtection of courts from the government.\nFederal law sets out the structure of the judiciary. Running courts is up to the L\u00e4nder. The L\u00e4nder (\"States of Germany\") are run the lower levels of the court system; only the highest courts are paid for by the federal government.\nThis federal-Land split means that the Federation (that is, the Federal Government) can make sure laws are enforced equally throughout the country, because it says what courts must be set up. The L\u00e4nder administer the courts, and this stops the federal government from being able to order the courts to do things, or to appoint the judges. This helps keep the courts independent.\nLegal system.\nGermany has a system of Roman law. This is different from the United States and England which use the common law.\nIn a common law system courts rely on \"precedents\" (what was decided in similar cases earlier) . In Germany, courts look to a comprehensive system of legal codes. The codes set out legal principles or basic ideas, and have to decide each case by comparing the facts of the case to those principles, not to what another judges decided earlier.\nTraining judges.\nBecause the legal codes are very important and complicated, judges must be very well trained.\nJudges are not chosen from practicing lawyers, as in the UK and USA. Instead being a judge is a separate career\nAt the end of their legal education at university, all law students must pass a state examination before they can continue on to an apprenticeship that provides them with broad training in the legal profession over two years. They then must pass a second state examination that qualifies them to practice law. After the second exam a person must choose either to be a lawyer or to be a judge.\nThose who choose to be a judge start working at courts immediately. However they are on \"probation\" (a temporary training period) for up to four years before being appointed as judges for lifetime.\nThe Court System.\nGermany has three types of courts.\nOrdinary Courts.\nThe are four levels of ordinary courts:\nSpecialized Courts.\nSpecialized courts deal with administrative, labor, social, fiscal, and patent law.\nThe is a Federal Patents Court in Munich adjudicates disputes relating to industrial property rights. Patents are a federal issue, so now state courts have been set up.\nConstitutional Courts.\nEach Land has a state constitutional court. These courts are administratively and financially independent from any other government body. For instance, a Land constitutional court can write its own budget and hire or fire employees.\nThese courts hear cases where the constitution and the rights it gives are in question.\nFor example, a criminal case might be appealed from the Bundesgerichtshof if a persons human rights are involved.\nThe Federal Constitutional Court, the \"Bundesverfassungsgericht\", can check that the way other courts look at the law to make sure they do not forget these basic rights. Sometimes the Federal Constitutional Court has overturned the decisions of other federal courts.\nThe \"Bundesverfassungsgericht\" protects people's rights under the constitution in another way. It is the only court that can ban a political party, if it is acting or says it will act against the constitution."}

His natural approach to the study of language also changed the philosophy of language and mind. He also invented the Chomsky hierarchy, a way of looking at formal languages in terms of their power to explain language.\nAccording to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index in 1992, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any other living scholar during the 1980\u20131992 time period.

He was one of the greatest composers of his time. He is best known for his church music, including many masses as well as motets and songs.\nHis life.\nObrecht\u2019s father was a trumpeter. His mother died when he was about 2 years old and his father remarried. We know nothing about Obrecht\u2019s musical education. He may have learned to play the trumpet like his father, who worked for the Burgundian court. Perhaps his father introduced him to people at the court, such as the famous composer Antoine Busnois. He certainly must have known Busnois\u2019 music.\nFrom 1480-1484 he was a choirmaster at Bergen-op-Zoom. Then he got a very good job as choirmaster at Cambrai Cathedral. However, a year later he took another job in Bruges. He wrote a lot of church music during his years in Bruges. He travelled to Italy and went to the town of Ferrara where a lot of famous musicians worked. He stayed there for several months. This may have been the reason why he then lost his job in Bruges. His next job was in Antwerp where he worked from 1492 to 1498. He then got his old job back in Bruges. From 1501 to 1503 he once again worked at Antwerp where he was choirmaster at the church of Our Lady. In 1504 he got the job of maestro di cappella at Ferrara, but the following year he died of the plague.\nHis reputation.\nObrecht composed extremely quickly. He is supposed to have written one of his masses in one night. This was different to Josquin des Prez who spent a long time composing his pieces and making changes to them before he let anyone have copies. Obrecht was influenced by the music of Busnois and Ockeghem. Obrecht himself was a big influence on Josquin, even though Josquin was older than Obrecht.\nIn recent years musicologists have studied Obrecht\u2019s music a lot and made many discoveries, including the correct dates for many of his works."}

He wrote church music, such as motets, as well as secular (non-religious) chansons. He was the most important composer of the late Burgundian school after the death of Guillaume Dufay.\nLife.\nWe do not know where Busnois was born. It might have been in the tiny village of Business in the Artois district. Maybe he took his name from the village.\nNothing is known about his musical education. We know that he got into trouble in 1461 because he was said to be in a group of people who beat up a priest on five occasions. At that time he was a chaplain in Tours cathedral. While the attack was being investigated he went to mass. This led to him being excommunicated, but later the pope pardoned him.\nIn 1465 he moved from the cathedral to the collegiate church of St. Martin, also in Tours, where he became a subdeacon. Johannes Ockeghem was treasurer there, and the two composers seem to have known each other well. Later in 1465 Busnois moved to Poitiers, where he not only became \"ma\u00eetrise\" (master of the choirboys), but managed to get lots of good singers from the region. By this time he was famous as a singing teacher and composer. However he left the job for some reason in 1466 and then moved to Burgundy.\nBy 1467 Busnois was a composer at the court of Burgundy. Soon Charles the Bold was on the throne. Charles fought many wars, and sometimes took Busnois and other musicians on his military journeys. In 1477 Charles was killed at the Battle of Nancy. Busnois continued to work for the Burgundian court until 1482. Nothing is known about what he did after that. He died in 1492.\nHis music.\nHe was very well known as a composer and his music was sung in many parts of Europe. \nHe was the probably the best-known musician in Europe between the time of Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem. \nBusnois wrote sacred and secular music. It is likely that a lot of his music is now lost. Two of his masses and eight motets have survived. The style of his music is somewhere between the simple homophonic music of Dufay and Binchois, and the more elaborate imitation of Josquin..\nBusnois may have been the composer of the famous tune \"L'homme arm\u00e9\", one of the most popular tunes of the Renaissance. The tune was often used as a cantus firmus for mass composition. He may have been the very first composer to write a mass based on \"L'homme arm\u00e9\". This mass was a big influence on many composers.\nBusnois is remembered today for many of his chansons (French secular songs). Some of the tunes were used by later composers in their masses."}

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a family and named the characters after members of his own, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987.

The number of robots in Japan means more people in Japan are likely to have a love of gadgets. Manga and anime series in both countries often show love or sex between robots and humans. This would mean more robosexuality.\nJapanese religious beliefs allow the idea that robots have souls. This also makes the idea of love between humans and robots more acceptable or ordinary.\nRobosexuality in the West.\nThe idea of physical sexuality is less accepted in the west than in Japan. Western societies are more likely to be against, or even fear the development of robots.

It is a member of the wheat family of plants and is similar to wheat and barley. It is used to make flour, food for animals, and many types of alcoholic drinks.\nHistory.\nRye has not always been a plant humans can use. It was originally a wild plant. There are several wild plants in Turkey that are similar to rye.\nSince the Middle Ages, rye has been used widely in Central and Eastern Europe.

Rye is a strong plant that can survive in soil with a high or low pH. This means it can survive even if the soil is very acidic or alkaline. Other plants may struggle to survive in these pH levels.\nUses for humans.\nRye has been used to make many foods for humans.

It stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. The movie is set in Paris, France in 1900. It tells the story of a young British writer called Christian, who falls in love with an actress called Satine, the leading lady of the famous nightclub, the Moulin Rouge.\n\"Moulin Rouge!\" was mostly shot at Fox Studios in Sydney, Australia. It was nominated for eight Oscars. It won two; for art direction and costume design. In 2006 it was ranked #25 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals.\nBackground.\nThe \"Moulin Rouge\".\nThe \"Moulin Rouge\" is a famous nightclub with a cabaret (or dance show). The name \"Moulin Rouge\" means \"Red Windmill\". In the late 1800s there was a real windmill where the nightclub stands near Montmartre in Paris. Now there is a large model of a windmill on the roof of the building. Since 1889 this nightclub has been famous for its dancing, in particular for the \"can-can\", a very lively dance in which the dancers, wearing long frilly skirts, kick their legs very high and show their underwear. (In the 1890s, women wore long dresses, to their ankles.) Even though this entertainment was not thought of as very polite, it was very popular and the \"can-can\" became a symbol of Paris. The \"Moulin Rouge\" is still very popular.\nBohemians.\nThe word Bohemian was first used in Paris to mean a Gypsy because many people thought that Gypsies came from Bohemia. The word was then used for poor artists and writers, who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money by their painting or writing. Paris was a famous town for both painters and writers to gather, to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city. Many of them lived at Montmartre, not far from the \"Moulin Rouge\". One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. He loved to paint the can-can dancers and prostitutes. He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs. The posters are now famous works of art.\n\"La boheme\".\n\"La boh\u00e8me\" means \"the Bohemian\". It is the name of a famous opera written by Giacomo Puccini. It is about a young man who lives in a group of poor artists and writers, and who meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl. The opera is very well known and Baz Luhrmann deliberately used parts of the story in his movie. The plot of the movie is very much like another opera called \"La traviata\" written by Giuseppe Verdi. It is also thought that Luhrmann may have got the idea to make \"Moulin Rouge!\" after watching \"Dil Se\". This movie was made in 1998 and directed by Mani Ratnam. It is a love story set in India.\nOther movies.\nThere have been four previous movies called \"Moulin Rouge\". The earliest was a silent movie made in 1928. The latest was made in 1956 and was about the life of the painter, Toulouse-Lautrec. Baz Luhrmann used Toulouse-Lautrec as an important character in his movie.\nThe movie.\nIdea.\nBaz Luhrmann had directed another movie in which a love story is set against a background of dance, costumes and colourful scenes. This is \"Strictly Ballroom\" made in 1992. In \"Moulin Rouge!\", he chose the colourful life of Paris in a time often called \"the Naughty Nineties\" as a background. But Lurhmann's plan was not to make a movie about history. He wanted to make a movie that the people of today would enjoy, just as much as the people of Paris had enjoyed the can-can in the 1890s. So Luhrmann did not use the music, dance-styles and lighting of the 1890s. He used popular modern music that young people already knew, and he used modern lighting, special effects and costume ideas to create a movie that young people would think was very entertaining.\nProduction.\nKate Winslet, Charlize Theron, Renee Zellweger, and Catherine Zeta-Jones were all thought of for the part of Satine. Courtney Love was almost cast in the role, but lost out to Kidman at the last minute because Luhrmann felt that Love would not fit into the movie well. Heath Ledger, Hugh Jackman, and Russell Crowe were all considered for the part of Christian.\nProduction on the movie began in November 1999 and was finished in May 2000, with a budget of just over $50 million. Nicole Kidman reportedly wasn't interested in doing the musical until she heard Baz Luhrmann would be directing it. Filming generally went smoothly, with the only major problem being when Nicole Kidman injured her knee while filming one of the more complicated dance sequences. The production also overran in its shooting schedule and had to be out of the Fox Studios in Sydney to make way for \"\" (in which Ewan McGregor also starred). This meant some parts had to be filmed in Madrid, Spain.\nPlot summary.\nThe movie is set in the year 1900. Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) is a British writer who came to the village of Montmartre in Paris in 1899, when the Bohemian movement was at its most popular. He sits in a flat looking down on the closed-down theatre called the Moulin Rouge while writing on a typewriter. The story he is writing is about the woman he loved, Satine (played by Nicole Kidman).\nIn 1899, Christian arrives in Paris, and makes friends with a group of Bohemians who visit the Moulin Rouge regularly. They are trying to produce a musical called \"Spectacular Spectacular\", which the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (played by Jim Broadbent), plans to show at the cabaret. The Bohemians' leader, Toulouse-Lautrec (played by John Leguizamo), is pleased with Christian's talent at writing and insists that he write their musical, \"Spectacular Spectacular\". Once they find out that Christian is an amazing writer, they come up with an complicated plan of presenting Christian to Satine, who is a beautiful courtesan, in the hopes that she will be impressed with him and persuade Zidler to hire Christian as the writer of the musical.\nSatine understands what her work involves, although she hopes of leaving the Moulin Rouge to become a \"real\" actress. Through a series of misunderstandings, she mistakes Christian for the rich and powerful Duke who will invest in the musical, \"Spectacular Spectacular\". She is enchanted by his poetry. She declares that she has fallen in love with him, but is shocked to realize he's actually a poor Bohemian poet.\nAfter a bit, the real Duke (played by Richard Roburgh) finds Christian and Satine together. They manage to trick him into believing that they were working on the musical, \"Spectacular Spectacular\". The main cast arrive and improvise the plot of the show on the spot: a beautiful Indian courtesan has her kingdom invaded by an \"evil maharaja\". She sets out to seduce him to save her kingdom, but accidentally seduces and then falls in love with a penniless sitar player. The two must hide their love and avoid the maharaja, though it is implied that one of them may die at the end of the story. (It is soon realized that the theme of their play foreshadows what happens in the movie's plot.) The Duke agrees to support the show. But, he quickly shows that he is a violently jealous man who will shut down the Moulin Rouge if he does not get Satine to himself. Nevertheless, he accepts that Satine will be busy with rehearsals and in close contact with Christian, the writer of the musical.\nChristian and Satine fall in love, while Zidler struggles to keep the Duke interested in the musical \"Spectacular Spectacular\" even though Satine has not yet slept with him. Harold Zidler also discovers that Satine is dying of a disease called tuberculosis, but does not tell anyone because of his motto, \"The show must go on\". Meanwhile, Christian continues to work on the play, in which the courtesan and the penniless sitar player end up together. The Duke, however, does not appreciate the ending and tells the cast that the courtesan must end up with the maharaja. To convince the Duke to change his mind, Satine finally agrees to spend the night with him. Christian is overcome with jealousy while Satine has dinner with the Duke, who offers her everything she has dreamt of. However, when Satine spots Christian on the street below, she refuses the Duke's offer, and he tries to rape her. After she escapes, Satine and Christian plan to run away.\nBy now, the Duke has realized Satine's tricks, and tells Zidler that, if the \"maharaja\" does not get his \"courtesan\", he will have the \"penniless sitar player\" killed. Nonetheless, Zidler must inform Satine of her final condition before she agrees to give up on the escape plan. She goes to Christian and lies to him, convincing him that her love was an act in the hopes that this will make him want to leave Paris and therefore save his life.\nAs the show opens, Satine performs tiredly, knowing that her life is almost up. Christian, refusing to give up on Satine, confronts her backstage. When she tries to force him off again, he takes the place of the show's hero, throwing money at her feet to \"pay his whore\", and storming off the stage. Satine confesses her love for him in the form of his secret song, and Christian and Satine get back together in full view of the audience and the Duke. The Duke attempts to shoot Christian, but Zidler forces him off. The audience applauds what they think is a good drama, but backstage, Satine is overcome by her illness and dies in Christian's arms. As her final wish, she asks Christian to tell their story.\nA year later, still in his flat overlooking the empty red windmill, Christian finally types the last page of his work, ending it with the couplet, \"The greatest thing you will ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return.\"\nSoundtrack.\nThe following is a list of some of the songs featured in the movie along with the artist that popularized them.\nElephant Love Medley\nTwo soundtrack albums were released, with the second coming after the huge success of the first one. The first volume featured the smash hit single \"Lady Marmalade\", performed by Christina Aguilera, Lil\u2019 Kim, M\u00fda and Pink. The first soundtrack, \"Moulin Rouge! Music From Baz Luhrmann's Film\", was released in May 2001, with the second \"Moulin Rouge! Music From Baz Luhrmann's Film, Vol. 2\" following in 2002.\nAwards.\nAward wins:\nAward nominations:"}

Out of the entire human population in the world, 19% are Han Chinese. Han Chinese have the highest concentrations in the Eastern Provinces of China, particularly in the Hebei, Jiangsu and Guangdong regions. There are tens of millions of overseas Han Chinese. The majority live in Southeast Asia. Many big cities around the world have enough \"overseas Chinese\" to make a \"Chinatown\".\nThe name.\nThe name \"Han\" comes from the Han Dynasty that united China as one country. During the Han Dynasty, many tribes felt that they belonged to the same ethnic group. Also, the Han Dynasty is said to be the high point in Chinese civilization. During the Han Dynasty, China was able to increase its power and influence to other parts of Asia.\nThere are some slang words and different names for Han amongst some Han people, especially in southern China and in Vietnam. In languages like Cantonese, Hakka and Min Nan, the word \"T\u00e1ng R\u00e9n\" is also used. \"T\u00e1ng R\u00e9n\" is written as \"\u5510\u4eba\" and it literally means \"the people of Tang.\" It is pronounced \"Tong Yan\" in Cantonese. \"\u5510\u4eba\" comes from another Chinese dynasty, the Tang Dynasty. The Tang Dynasty is also another peak point of the Chinese civilization. Within English-speaking Han communities, the word \"Chinatown\" in Chinese is \"T\u00e1ng R\u00e9n Ji\u0113\" which means \"street of the Tang people.\"\nAnother phrase used by the Han people, especially overseas Chinese, is \"Hua Ren\" (). It comes from \"Zhong Hua\" (), a poetic name for China. The translation of this is \"ethnic Chinese\".\nCulture.\nHan China is one of the world's oldest civilizations. Chinese culture dates back thousands of years. Some Han people believe they share common ancestors, distantly related to the Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor, who existed thousands of years ago. Hence, some people of Han call themselves \"Descendants of the Yan Emperor\" or \"Descendants of the Yellow Emperor.\"\nThroughout the history of China, Chinese culture has been influenced by Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. Confucianism was the official philosophy throughout most of Imperial China's history, and becoming a professional of Confucian texts was needed to be part of the imperial bureaucracy."}

On 28 September 1941, they put up an order in the town. Part of it said:\nThe massacre.\nLater, one of the soldiers in charge of the massacre would say:\nOn September 29 and 30, special units of the SS called \"Einsatzgruppen\", and some local Ukrainians who supported the Nazis, took these people to the ravine at Babi Yar. They made them put all of their things in piles. They made them strip naked. The area was so crowded that by the time people heard gunshots, there was no way to escape. The Nazis took people ten at a time into the ravine, made them lay down, and shot them with machine guns.\nBetween September 29 and 30, the Nazis killed 33,771 Jewish people at Babi Yar.\nThe Nazis buried these people in a mass grave. People who had survived being shot were buried alive, along with the dead. Only 29 people survived and were able to escape.\nThe murdered Jews' property was given to Nazi leaders in Kyiv."}

It is part of Mahayana buddhism and is one of three main branches still practiced today. The other two are Han Buddhism and Theravada. It is most widely practiced around the Himalayas, Central Asia, and Siberia. \nIt includes all of the Buddhist teachings (or \"three vehicles\"). All traditions of Tibetan Buddhism practice the vows of moral discipline (Pratimoksha) of the hearer's vehicle (Shr\u0101vakay\u0101na); the vows of universal liberation and philosophy of the great vehicle (Mah\u0101y\u0101na); and the pledges and special methods of the secret mantra vehicle (Vajray\u0101na). \nHistory.\nIn the 7th century, Songtsen Gampo married two Buddhists: Tang Dynasty Princess Wencheng and Nepali Princess Bhrikuti. They helped spread Buddhist teachings to Tibet. Buddhism was merged with local B\u00f6n religions of the Zhangzhung to create a new kind of Buddhism: Tibetan Buddhism. The Tibetans also began translating texts from Sanskrit and Chinese; and began writing some of their own texts. In the 8th century, an Indian teacher called Padmasambhava brought some more Buddhism while Trisong Detsen was king of Tibet. He also wrote a number of important texts. \nIn the 11th century, Tibetan Buddhism strong influenced the peoples of Central Asia, Mongolia and Manchuria. It was very popular during the Mongol Yuan dynasty and the Manchu Qing dynasty of China.\nSchools of Tibetan Buddhism.\nTibetan Buddhism has four main schools. Two of these schools hold practice as more important and two hold scholasticism (study of philosophy) more important. The four schools are:\nTeachings.\nSome of the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism are Mahamudra, the Six Yogas of Naropa, and Dzogchen.\nLanguage.\nClassical Tibetan is the main language for Tibetans. But texts have also been translated into Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese.\nMonasteries (places of worship).\nMonasticism was the foundation of Buddhism in Tibet. There were over 6,000 monasteries in Tibet, however nearly all of these were destroyed by Chinese Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. Most of the major monasteries have been at least partly restored while many others remain in ruins.\nToday.\nToday, Tibetan Buddhism has spread throughout the Eastern world excluding Southeast Asia. It is practiced in the Tibetan Plateau, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Kalmykia, Siberia, Russian Far East, northeast China, Arunachal Pradesh. It is the state religion of Bhutan. The Indian regions of Sikkim, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal are also home to large Tibetan Buddhist populations. There are also communities in South India. \nTibetan Buddhism has expanded to the West and throughout the world. Celebrity practitioners include Brandon Boyd, Richard Gere, Adam Yauch, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Sharon Stone, Allen Ginsberg, Philip Glass, Mike Barson and Steven Seagal. "}

The band began in 2001, and were first called Devilish. The people who are in the band all came from Magdeburg in Germany. The youngest, the Kaulitz twins, were born two months before the Berlin Wall was taken down.\nHistory.\nTokio Hotel was started by singer Bill Kaulitz and guitarist Tom Kaulitz, who are identical twin brothers. Their step father owns a music school named \"Rock School\". The drummer is Gustav Sch\u00e4fer and bass-guitarist is Georg Listing. The four met in 2001 after a live show in a Magdeburg club, where Listing and Sch\u00e4fer, who knew each other from music school, watched from the audience while Bill and Tom Kaulitz played on the stage. Using the name \"Devilish\", the band began playing in talent shows and small concerts. After Bill Kaulitz took part in a children's Star Search in 2003 at age thirteen (which he lost in the quarter-final), he was discovered by music producer Peter Hoffmann. Devilish changed their name to \"Tokio Hotel\": \"Tokio\", the German spelling of the Japanese city Tokyo, because they love the city, and \"Hotel\" because of their constant touring and living in hotels. Soon after Sony BMG took them under contract, Hoffmann hired David Jost and Pat Benzner into the team of creators and authors. They guided the teens on songwriting and instrument playing; most of the songs of the first album were written by Hoffmann, Jost, Benzer, and Bill Kaulitz (including the singles \"Scream\" and \"Rescue me\" which were completely written by them). Only the single \"Unendlichkeit\" was written completely by Tokio Hotel themselves. However, shortly before release of their first album, Sony ended their contract. In 2005, Universal Music Group took Tokio Hotel under contract and developed a marketing plan. The band has now become one of the biggest acts from Germany.\nMembers.\nBill Kaulitz (born September 1 1989, in Leipzig, Germany) is the lead singer of Tokio Hotel. He is the twin brother of Tom Kaulitz. Bill is ten minutes younger than Tom. They used to live in Magdeburg, Germany. Before making Tokio Hotel, the band was called Devilish. Bill was on the German star search but he lost in 2001. Because of Bill going on the Star Search he came to be known by Peter Hoffman. Tokio Hotel soon got a job with Sony but in 2005 Sony ended it. After the first European tour, Bill lost his voice and found out he had cyst on his vocal cords. He had surgery and it took three weeks to get better. He then went back to having concerts with the band.\nTom Kaulitz was born on September 1 1989, in Leipzig ten minutes before his identical twin brother, Bill. He is from Magdeburg in Germany. Tom and Bill now live in Berlin, Germany. As of September 2007, Tom is using Gibson guitars. He has stated his musical influences to be Aerosmith and German hip-hop such as Samy Deluxe. \nGeorg Listing was born on March 31 1987. His hometown is Halle. He began playing bass when he was thirteen years old, as of September 2007, uses a Sandberg bass. He has said that his playing style was heavily influenced by Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers, and other musical influences include Die \u00c4rzte and Oasis.\nGustav Sch\u00e4fer was born on September 8 1988, in his hometown of Magdeburg, and has an older sister. Gustav has been playing the drums since he was five. His musical influences include Metallica, Joe Cocker and Rod Stewart."}

Where its name came from is not known; it may be named after the mythical Hercules, or after an unknown woman of that name. Most of the asteroids found by Wolf around this date were named for characters in operas, but if this name was also drawn from such a source, no explanation has been recorded.\nPhysical characteristics.\nHerculina is one of the twenty or so biggest members of the main asteroid belt.\nIt has often been noted for its complex lightcurves, which made finding its shape and rotation somewhat hard. A set of 1982 speckle inferometry observations led to a simple preliminary model of Herculina as a three-axis object, perhaps 260 by 220 by 215\u00a0km. 1985 analysis of this data concluded there was a nonspherical shape with one bright spot, whilst a 1987 photometric astrometry study concluded the object was spherical with two dark spots (and rotated around a completely different pole), which was in turn negated by a 1988 thermal study which showed the object could not be spherical. By the late 1980s, the generally accepted model was a three-axis object with major albedo or topographical features.\nRecent (2002) modelling of photometric data shows that Herculina is not spherical, but a blocky shape not unlike a battered cuboid - or, as the analysis described it, it \"resembles a toaster\". This analysis indicates the presence of many big craters, similar to 253 Mathilde, but no major changes in albedo. The approximate ratios of the axes were suggested as 1:1.1:1.3, broadly consistent with earlier models if a bit more stretched.\nMoons.\nFollowing anomalous sightings during an occultation of the star SAO 1220774 in 1978, Herculina became the first asteroid to be \"confirmed\" to have an asteroid moon, with the parent asteroid estimated at a 216\u00a0km diameter and a moon of about 45\u00a0km orbiting at a distance of around 1,000\u00a0km. However, careful studying in 1993, using the Hubble Space Telescope, could not locate a moon."}

A Pacific hurricane, then, is a tropical cyclone in the northern Pacific Ocean east of the Date Line. Tropical cyclones that form in the western north Pacific are called typhoons. This separation between the two basins is convenient, however, as tropical cyclones rarely form in the central north Pacific and few ever cross the dateline."}

It was started in 1979 by Chrissie Maher. The company advocates for the use of simple (\"plain\") English. It tries to persuade organisations in the UK and abroad to communicate with the public simply. In 1990, Plain English Campaign created the Crystal Mark, its \"seal of approval.\" This is a symbol printed on documents which the Plain English campaign thinks are very easy to understand. According to the Plain English Campaign, the symbol appears on over 20,000 documents worldwide.\nThe Plain English Campaign also gives out an annual \"Foot in Mouth Award\" for \"a baffling comment by a public figure.\" The name of this award comes from a humorous English idiom. If a person has their \"foot in their mouth,\" that means they are speaking badly and not paying attention to what they are saying. The plain English Campaign also gives out a \"Golden Bull Award\" for \"the worst examples of written tripe\". The name of this award also comes from a common English idiom. \"Bull\" is short for \"bullshit,\" which literally means the excrement of a bull, but is often used to mean stupid, dishonest or unbelievable speech or writing. The word \"tripe,\" similar to \"bullshit,\" has both a literal and a figurative meaning. Literally, it means a food made from an animal's stomach lining. As it is used here, \"tripe\" means something very close to \"bullshit.\"\nIn other words, the Plain English Campaign's \"Foot in Mouth Award\" is given to someone famous who speaks stupidly. The \"Golden Bull Award\" is given to someone famous who writes stupidly. Both awards are sarcastic. They are different from normal awards because they criticise, rather than honor, the people they are given to. Famous winners of the Foot in Mouth Award include George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.\nPlain English Campaign has worked for many organisations. Many UK forms and bills carry the Crystal Mark, including the British passport application form. Plain English Campaign is often described in the media as a \"pressure group.\" \nIt regularly makes public comments about language-related news stories and about jargon. For example, in 2006 its supporters voted Bill Shankly the author of the greatest football quotation of all time. Plain English Campaign did a survey in 2004 and announced that \u2018At the end of the day\u2019 was considered the most irritating clich\u00e9. Chrissie Maher, who created Plain English Campaign, was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1994 for her services to plain communication. Famous supporters of PEC include Margaret Thatcher and broadcaster John Humphrys."}

All four schools identify themselves as belonging to the Mahayana or \"Great Vehicle\" tradition, which is the most popular form of Buddhism in China, Korea and Japan.\nLevels of practice.\nIn the \"ancient\" or Nyingma school, the teachings are divided into six levels:\nThe \"new\" schools (Sakya, Kagyu, and Geluk) divide the teachings into only four levels. The first three are the same as in the Nyingma school. The last level is simply called Anuttarayogatantra (\"Highest Yoga Tantra\"). These Highest Yoga Tantras are divided into \"mother\", \"father\" and \"non-dual\" tantras. The new schools use a practice called Mahamudra in place of Dzogchen."}

In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 300. Letters that came from it include the Roman T and Cyrillic \u0422.\nOther Uses.\nSome people want to use Tau in place of Pi, the special number that comes from circles. Tau would be equal to two times pi, or about 6.283.\nThese people want to use Tau because they think it would be easier for everyone to understand. There are many reasons in math why Tau could be useful or helpful. One of the simplest is that it would make learning about radians easier.\nA radian is a way of measuring the angle of a circle. It says that the number of radians in an angle is equal to the length of the outside of the circle, or the 'arc length', that is covered by an angle, divided by the radius, or distance from the point in the center of a circle to anywhere on the outside (see the picture on the bottom right of the page).\nIf the distance covered around the outside of a circle is equal to the radius, than one radian is being covered. Around the whole outside of a circle, there are about 6.283 radians - or, Tau radians (Tau is just a number, like 0, or 7, or 100).\nThe advantage of this is that one quarter of a circle would simply become Tau / 4 radians, and one half of a circle Tau / 2 radians, which is more in line with our intuition on circles (see also the drawing below).\nNot many people use Tau yet, but more and more are."}

He referred to a study by John P. Robinson, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, showing that the average American at that time spent only 24 minutes per day in reading. He mentioned the continuing decline in newspaper sales, and referred to a guess by Leonard Riggio, CEO of Barnes &amp; Noble, that 50% of books sold by his company were never read. He quoted Samuel Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, on his preference for the ease of turning on the TV instead of reading a book. Sherman went on, in his article, to mention the growing need for skillful commmunication in American business but also the decreasing quality of the same activity. He quoted Monsanto CEO Richard Mahoney on the importance of reading in helping a business manager to see connections between events. He described print media as being first among different media with respect to (1) the amount of information conveyed by so few widely understood symbols, (2) portability, (3) suitability for the user's own speed of use, and (4) economical distribution of broad and deep information which can be used immediately.\nSherman said that Motorola was making preparations to pay $5,000,000 to teach workers reading and other basic skills, and that, since 1982, Ford Motor Company had already sent 32,000 workers on a similar program. He said that Simon &amp; Schuster predicted a market of $500,000,000 per year in the sales of remedial programs to corporations. He quoted a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters as saying that \"the biggest predictor of scholastic success is the time parents spend reading to their children.\" However, Sherman said that the amount of time thus spent meant that the outlook was \"not bright\".

It was written by Adam Smith in 1776, who was a Scottish man. It looks at division of work, following self-interest, and freedom of trade.\nThe book was not the beginning of classical economics, and market economics. Smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves, the result would be best for society. Before that, economics was about the king's personal interests, and the wealth of a nation was measured by the king's treasury or by the gold and silver in the country. \nSmith said what's important is what's best for the whole nation, and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation. He wanted to discover how wealth can grow, and how people could do things to support that growth. Smith's book said land, labour, and capital were the three \"factors of production\" and the main contributors to a nation's wealth.\nPrices naturally adjust to having more or less of something: supply and demand. If there is too much of something (more supply), prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it. If a lot of people want something (high demand), there may not be enough of it (scarcity); there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it, and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want, and prices go up. \nSmith said markets should be free. At the time, some big companies (like the East India Company) were controlled by the government. Sometimes the rulers made laws that were good for themselves but not for workers or customers. For example, in the American colonies, colonists could grow cotton but were not allowed to make clothing from it. They had to ship it to England to be made into clothing, then buy it back after it was finished. Smith said this was bad for individuals and for society. He thought it was better for money to flow freely and naturally between buyers and sellers without outside interference. Money would naturally go to the sellers who made the best product at the best price. This way if people did what was best for them, it would end up being best for society as a whole, almost like an \"invisible hand\" was guiding everything."}

He is also one of the few descendants of the royal family of the Qing Dynasty. He is the great-great grandson of the Daoguang Emperor. He was born in the Prince Gong Mansion in Beijing, China.\nArt career.\nIn 1957, he joined the China Artists' Association, and in 1981 he was added into The Chinese Great Artists' Dictionary. He has won many art prizes in China dealing with Chinese traditional art, his pieces are mostly landscapes, people, and close-up flowers and bamboo. \nEarly art career.\nYuHuan was an only son of Aixinjueluo Pu Shu Ming who has lived in the Prince Gong Mansion for some time after the Qing Dynasty was overruled. Good links to his uncle Pu Xin-Yu, who was a famous traditional artist of China, provided him with art lessons which set his appetite for painting Chinesetraditional art. In Junior High School, he has already started publishing his own comics on the newspapers, he became more and more interested in the arts, he eventually applied and was accepted by the Arts Department of the Beijing Normal University. The art he was taught at the Beijing Normal University was Western art although he was used to Chinese paintings.\nMusic career.\nArtist YuHuan was also a sanxian musician, his lessons with traditional Chinese instruments started when he was a child, and still living in the Prince Gong Mansion. At his death, he had already mastered many difficult pieces and he played until his late 60s.\nThe Song of Qing Dynasty.\nAt the age of eight, he started to learn the sanxian, a 500-year-old Chinese three-string, plucked instrument. The song he learned was a song from the Qing Dynasty(the dynasty of his great-great grandfather), it consisted of 13 pieces, with each piece about 20\u201345 minutes long. He did not learn all of the pieces of the song because his tutor only knew 13 of them (there were more that his tutor did not know); even so, it took him 2 years to master it, with courses of one 2-hour lesson per week. He had already passed on the song to a lecturer in the Central Conservatoire of Music in Beijing, his student also took two years to master it.\nInfluences.\nThe leaders of many countries and foreign ministers have met with Yuhuan and either bought or received his paintings as donations or presents, the countries include: Hungary, Germany, the USA, Canada, Japan, and many more. He has also lectured in many universities Japan, Singapore and Indonesia. Galleries and exhibitions of his work were also presented to and hosted at many of the above countries.\nFamily.\nMr. Aixinjueluo has three successful sons, whose names are Aixinjueluo Hengyue(writer), Aixinjuelo Hengkai(artist), and Aixinjueluo Hengjun(IT specialist)."}

It was created by the Scottish sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi in London, 1952. Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana and Roy Lichtenstein are examples of pop artists.\nPop art has themes and techniques drawn from popular mass culture, such as advertising and comic books. Pop art employs images of popular as opposed to elitist culture in art.\nOrigin.\nThe Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1951, is regarded as the starting point of the pop art movement. They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of \"fine art\". The group discussions centered on popular culture implications from such elements as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology.\nAt the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled \"Bunk!\" that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947\u20131949. This material consisted of 'found objects' such as, advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics that mostly represented American popular culture. One of the images in that presentation was Paolozzi's 1947 collage, \"I was a Rich Man's Plaything\", which includes the first use of the word \"pop\u2033, appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver. After Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.\nMethods.\nThe artists use mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques which downplay the expressive hand of the artist.\nPop artists went for absolute clarity. Most forms were bordered with black lines as in comic books. The objects are often plain like a poster, and without perspective. The colours are clear, achromatic and primitive colours.\nObjects of the everyday life get isolated and modified or processed in collages. Pop art is a connection between reality and art, handled with abstract means. Some of their catchwords are: popular, consumable, cheap, funny and outstanding.\nMuch of pop art is rather academic, as the unconventional organizational practices used often make it difficult for some to understand. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be the last modern art movements and so the precursors to postmodern art, or some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves."}

It is on the banks of the River Derwent in the south of Derbyshire. In the 2001 census, 233,700 people lived there. At that time, Derby was the 18th largest place in England.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe city has Roman, Saxon and Viking origins.\nThe Roman camp of 'Derventio' was probably near to Derby. The site of the old Roman fort is at Chester Green. Later the town was one of the 'Five Boroughs' of the Danelaw.\nThe town name is seen as 'Darby' or 'Darbye' on early modern maps, such as that of Speed (1610).\nModern research into the history and archaeology of Derby has shown that the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons probably co-existed, occupying two areas of land surrounded by water. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (c. 900) says that \"Derby is divided by water\". These areas of land were known as Nor\u00fewor\u00feig and Deoraby, and were at the \"Irongate\" (north) side of Derby.\nModern History.\nIn World War I, Derby was targeted by German Zeppelin air bombers. They killed five people in a 1916 raid on the town.\nAll Saints Church was designated as a cathedral in 1927. That showed that the town was ready for city status.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, slums were cleared out and people were moved to new council estates in the suburbs. There were also houses for sale there. Rehousing, council house building and private housing developments continued on a large scale for some 30 years after the end of World War II in 1945.\nDerby became a high profile town internationally in sport following the appointment of Brian Clough as manager of Derby County F.C. in 1967. Promotion to the Football League First Division was achieved in 1969, and County won of the English league three years later. Following the Clough's resignation in 1973, his successor guided County to another league title in 1975, but this is the club's last major trophy to date; relegation followed in 1980 and top flight status was not regained until 1987, since when Derby have spent a total of 10 seasons (across two spells) in the top flight. The club moved from its century-old Baseball Ground in 1997 to the new Pride Park Stadium.\nDerby was awarded city status on 7 June 1977 by Queen Elizabeth II. Until then, Derby had been one of the few towns in England with a cathedral but not city status.\nDespite its strategic industries (rail and aero-engine), Derby suffered comparatively little damage in both world wars (contrast Bristol and Filton). This may in part have been due to the jamming of the German radio-beam navigations systems (X-Verfahren and Knickebein), camouflage and decoy techniques ('Starfish sites') were built, mainly south of the town, e.g. out in fields near Foremark.\nSport and Culture.\nSport.\nDerby has several sports clubs.\nDerby's main football club is Derby County who've won the FA Cup and the Football League. There are also three senior non-league football clubs based in the city. Derby also had a short lived baseball team, which played at Derby's former ground.\nArthur Keily the marathon runner and Olympian was born in Derbyshire in 1921 and has lived his whole life in Derby. In Rome in 1960 he broke the English Olympic record, recording a time of 2hours 27mins.\nRecreation.\nDerby has the first public park in the country to have an arboretum, which is south of the city centre. The arboretum was set up by the philanthropic landowner and industrialist Joseph Strutt in 1840. The arboretum's website states that the arboretum's design was the inspiration for the vision of great urban parks in the USA, notably Central Park in New York City.\nThere are four museums: Derby Museum and Art Gallery; Pickford's House Museum; The Silk Mill and The Royal Crown Derby Museum."}

The race was won by Oxford despite Cambridge being ahead early in the contest.\nLandscape.\nEly is built on an clay which is one of the highest points in the Fens. This is very different to the West of Cambridgeshire which is made up of limestone. The river Great Ouse runs through the city, and is one of the longest rivers in the UK with many others flowing into it. The drainage area of the rivers that form the Great Ouse is around 6000 square miles (16,000 square kilometres). This is five times larger than the Fens itself The landscape was a large marsh until the 18th century, when much of the Fens was drained, making Ely no longer an island. Because of this, the ground around the city is very fertile and most of the region is used for farming.

It is a process wherein sound waves are captured by a machine. The machine converts the waves into electrical signals or digital data, that are then stored on recording media (such as gramophone records, cassette tapes, compact discs or computer hard drives). The sound can then be played back by reversing the process.\nMost recordings are of music, people speaking or singing, and sound effects. They are usually used for entertainment (fun), or for scientific and historical reasons.\nSound is recorded onto a medium by different methods. The ways that recordings are made have changed a lot since sound was first recorded.\nTechnology.\nAnalog cylinder.\nThe first machines for recording sound were mechanical, not electrical. The phonograph was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in 1877. Phonographs have a spinning cylinder covered in a soft material such as tin foil, lead, wax, or amberol. Sound waves shake a small needle so that its motion carries the waves. As the cylinder turns, the needle draws the motion of the sound waves in the soft coating. This made the cylinder a recording of the sound that was in the needle.\nThis recording is played back by tracing another needle through the groove in the cylinder. This recreates the small vibrations in the playback needle. These vibrations could be amplified (made louder) to create louder, more audible sound.\nThe phonograph was useful for making single recordings, but a big disadvantage was the difficulty of making copies of the cylinders.\nAnalog disk.\nThe problem of copying recordings got better with the invention of the gramophone (also called the \"phonograph\" in American English) around 1888. The gramophone works in much the same way as the phonograph, but instead of a cylinder, the needle's grooves are etched into a disk record which turns on a spinning table. Because the record media was flat, copying recordings was much simpler. Pressing the original recording onto a plate of shellac created a negative master, where the grooves were bumps on the surface instead of being scratched into the surface. The master could be used to produce many copies through the opposite process.\nThe first records were made mostly of rubber or shellac, but later records were made of vinyl.\nOriginally, records spun at a rate of 78 rotations per minute, or 78 rpm. As technology got better, records could spin more slowly, but still reproduce sound better and play for longer amounts of time. 45 rpm became common in the middle 20th century, and by the late 1900s most records were 33 rpm.\nTape.\nIn the late 1930s the tape recorder appeared. Tape recorders use a magnetic tape as a medium, with a \"recording head\" to store the sound on the tape. Sound waves are converted into an electrical signal inside the recorder. This signal goes into the head, where it changes the polarity of very small magnets. Tape moves past the head at a constant speed, and its magnetic particles are rearranged by these magnets to a pattern that represents the sound wave. These magnetic patterns are much like the small grooves of a cylinder or disc record in the way that they represent the vibration energy of sound waves.\nWhen a tape is played back, it runs past a \"playback head\" which reads the magnetic patterns off the tape and converts them back into an electrical signal. The electrical signal can then be converted into sound waves or copied to some other kind of sound-processing machine.\nA magnetic tape is divided into several \"tracks\". Each track uses up part of the width of the tape, and can store a completely different recording that can be played back at the same time as the other tracks. A two-track tape has one track on half of the tape and another track on the other half. A four-track tape has four tracks all lying next to one another, like a highway with four lanes. Most tape recordings today are stereophonic (or \"stereo\"), meaning that they have two tracks which are meant to be played together. Usually one is played on the listener's left side and the other is on the listener's right side, to match the listener's two ears.\nEarly tapes were wound flat on a storage reel and transferred to a \"take-up reel\" as they were recorded or played. After recording or playback, they were \"rewound\" so that they were stored only on the storage reel. This kind of system is usually called \"reel to reel\" today. It is still used today for some professional recording and playback, but for home use reels were mostly replaced with other kinds of tape in the 1970s. Cassettes are small cartridges containing two reels inside. Cassettes move a four-track tape in either of two directions, corresponding to their \"side A\" and \"side B\" labels. The reel on the left contains the unplayed or unrecorded tape, and the reel on the right contains the tape that has already passed the recording or playback head. When you turn the cassette over, the tape still moves from left to right, but this is really the opposite direction. The \"side A\" recording plays two tracks as stereo, and the \"side B\" recording plays the other two.\nEight-track tapes were popular for a while in the 1970s and 1980s. Eight-tracks work much like cassettes, but the tape is a loop: it repeats after being played all the way through. Because it has eight tracks, there are four \"programs\" to select from, each in stereo. Eight-tracks are not very popular anymore, but can still be found in hobbyist collections.\nProfessional tape-recording systems may have even more tracks, or might use them differently. Usually a system like this is designed to allow someone to mix the tracks in different ways than they were originally recorded. However, there is a kind of recording called quadraphonic that uses four-track tape to play four different tracks at the same time. A good quadraphonic recording can sound much more \"real\" than stereo or monophonic recordings.\nDigital Audio Tape.\nTape recording technology was used from the early days of computing to store digital information. As computer technology improved, so did magnetic tape technology. In the 1980s Digital Audio Tape (DAT) technology emerged. DAT is designed to work much like cassette, except DAT's magnetic patterns represent digital data instead of sound vibrations. This digital data is a digital audio recording which can be copied and reproduced with many different computer systems. Moving to digital takes the medium one step farther from the original sound. Instead of being a sound medium, the DAT is a data medium, and the data is a sound medium. This is more technically complex, but also more flexible. DAT has been used for many kinds of data recording, in addition to sound.\nCompact Disc.\nThe compact disc (CD) medium was developed in the 1980s as a new way to bring digital recordings of music to the market. Except for the introduction of the CD-ROM and several kinds of recordable CD, the CD has not changed much since then. Like DAT, it is a data medium rather than a way of recording vibrations directly. It was introduced to provide music in a way that is cheap for manufacturers but relatively high-quality, but it has since been adapted to meet many data-storage needs. Like DAT, the CD requires computer technology to record and to play.\nBy the 1990s, CDs had replaced cassettes and records as the main kind of commercial music media. Today, although CDs are still very popular, \"online\" digital recordings like MP3s are gaining fast.\nTechniques.\nThe earliest methods of recording sound involved the live recording of the performance directly to the recording medium. This was an entirely mechanical process, often called \"acoustical recording\". The sound of the performers was captured by a diaphragm with the cutting needle connect to it. The needle made the grooves in the recording medium.\nTo make this process as efficient as possible the diaphragm was located at the apex of a cone and the performer(s) would crowd around the other end. If a performer was too loud then they would need to move back from the mouth of the cone to avoid drowning out the other performers. As a result of this, in early Jazz recordings a block of wood was used in place of the bass drum.\nThe introduction of electrical recording made it possible to use microphones to capture the sound of the performance. The leading record labels switched to the electric microphone process in 1925, and most other record companies followed their lead by the end of the decade. Electrical recording increased the flexibity and sound quality. However once the performance was still cut to the recording medium, so if a mistake was made the recording was useless.\nElectrical recording made it possible to record one part to disc and then play that back while playing another part, recording both parts to a second disc. This is called \"over-dubbing\". The first commercially issued records using over-dubbing were released by the Victor Talking Machine Company in the late 1920s. However overdubbing was of limited use until the introduction of analog audio tape. Use of tape overdubbing was pioneered by Les Paul and is called 'sound on sound' recording. In this way performances could be built up over time.\nThe analog tape recorder made it possible to erase or record over a previous recording so that mistakes could be fixed. Another advantage of recording on tape is the ability to cut the tape and join it back together. This allows the recording to be edited. Pieces of the recording can be removed, or rearranged. See Audio editing\nThe introduction of electronic instruments (especially keyboards and synthesisers), effects and other instruments has led to the importance of MIDI in recording. For example, using MIDI timecode, it is possible to have different equipment 'trigger' without direct human intervention at the time of recording.\nIn more recent times, computers (digital audio workstation) have found an increasing role in the recording studio, as their use eases the tasks of cutting and looping, as well as allowing for instantaneous changes, such as duplication of parts, the addition of affects and the rearranging of parts of the recording.\nHistory.\nThe French bookseller and printer \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville was the earliest known inventor of sound recording. It is believed he invented the first ever sound recording device known as the Phonautograph."}

This group is called the \"Lakotah Freedom Delegation\". They believe the Republic of Lakotah should be treated as a separate country, but at the moment, no other country in the world agrees that it is.\nBackground.\nWhen white people first came to North America from Europe, the Lakotah people, who are a native tribe, had already been living there for thousands of years. The Lakotah legally had nothing to do with the USA until they made treaties (agreements) with each other in the 1800s.\nSince then, the Lakotah people have lived inside the borders of the USA. On December 17, 2007, the Lakotah Freedom Delegation said that Lakotah should become a separate country again, as it was before they made treaties with the USA.\nThey drew up borders, which includes bits of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana. At the moment, most people consider these regions still to belong to the USA.\nReasons for wanting independence.\nIn December 2007, the group traveled to Washington, D.C. and spoke to the government. They announced that the Lakotah were withdrawing from the treaties they had with the USA. They said the USA had not been following the treaties and this had been causing problems on Lakotah land.\nFor example, the USA and the Lakotah made an agreement called the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which meant the Lakotah could keep the Black Hills. The Black Hills is a very sacred and special place for the Lakotah. But the USA broke the agreement and invaded the Black Hills when they found out that gold was buried there. Now the Black Hills is home to the famous mountain carvings of Mount Rushmore.\nThe group says that the Republic of Lakotah is not a new country, but a country that has just been revived. But some members of the Lakotah tribe complain that they were not told about the plans. Many of the leaders of the Lakotah tribe were not asked beforehand. Traditionally, a vote needs to be held if a treaty is going to be changed, and 75% of Lakotah males need to vote in favor of the change. But a vote was not held when the plans for the Republic of Lakotah were being made.\nThe group argues that Lakotah is allowed to be its own country, by law. They use the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article Six of the United States Constitution and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to back up their plans.\nThe Lakotah Freedom Delegation say they might follow the example of the Philippines or the Marshall Islands, countries which used to belong to the United States but then achieved independence.\nGovernment.\nAnyone is allowed to be a citizen of the Republic of Lakotah as long as they give up their citizenship of the United States. The group plans to make its own passports and driving licenses.\nThe government will be run in the traditional Lakotah way. The elderly people, who receive a lot of respect in Lakotah tradition, will choose leaders to run the country.\nAt the moment, supporters of the Lakotah Freedom Delegation are arguing over the name of the country. Some people like the name \"Republic of Lakotah\", but others prefer \"Lakotah Oyate\". \"Oyate\" is the Lakotah word meaning \"nation\".\nThe government plans to use solar energy and wind power to make electricity, because these methods do not hurt the environment.\nSupport.\nA place does not exist as a country until other countries in the world recognise its borders or its government, and treat it as a separate country. The Lakotah Freedom Delegation has contacted the embassies of Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile and South Africa, asking to be recognised as an independent country. The group has also mentioned Russia, Finland and Iceland, and said that Ireland and East Timor are interested in the plans. But at the moment, no other country in the world is treating Lakotah as a separate country.\nThe US government is unlikely to support the Republic of Lakotah because it means the USA will lose some land. They've said that the group's plans do not mean anything."}

The word is often used in music to mean any song with French words, but it is more often used when talking about songs in which lyrics have been set to music by French classical composers.\nVery often \"chansons\" refers to the French songs that were sung in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. People who sang these chansons were called \"chansonniers\". They had various forms, including ballade, rondeau and virelai. Some composers at the time liked to set popular poetry to music. The earliest chansons were for two, three or four voices, many of them being for three voices. By the 16th century most were for four voices. Sometimes, the singers were accompanied by instruments. \nEarly chansons.\nThe first important composer of chansons was the medieval composer Guillaume de Machaut. In the Renaissance Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois wrote many simple chansons. Later Johannes Ockeghem and Josquin des Prez composed chansons which had lots of imitation between the voices. Cl\u00e9ment Janequin wrote more simple, homophonic chansons. He worked in the area around Paris. Later composers such as Orlando de Lassus were influenced by the Italian madrigal. The style of music started to be used in music for instruments.\nThe first book of sheet music printed from movable type was \"Harmonice Musices Odhecaton\", a collection of 96 chansons by many composers, published in Venice in 1501.\nLater chansons.\nDuring the 16th century French songs started to be composed with lute or keyboard accompaniment. In the 19th century many composers wrote songs with piano accompaniment. These chansons were often called m\u00e9lodies.\nPopular Chanson.\nIn France today \"chanson\" often refers to the work of more popular singers such as Georges Brassens, Jacques Brel, \u00c9dith Piaf, Camille, Olivia Ruiz.\nFrench chansons of Jacques Brel have been translated and are interpreted in English by Arnold Johnston, Professor at West Michigan University. More than 100 chansons of Brel, Brassens, Barbara, B\u00e9caud, Ferrat, Aznavour, Trenet et Ferr\u00e9 have been translated and are interpreted in German language by the Duo St\u00e9phane &amp; Didier (see www.deutsche-chanson-texte.de)."}

It suggests the American female pop singing groups of the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were hugely successful for a time, between the decline of early rock and roll and the British Invasion. Many of them were influenced by doo-wop style.\nIn the 1950s and 60s, the groups were mostly self-organised, girls who knew each other and often grew up together. The Chantels, for example, were four girl choristers from a Catholic high school in the Bronx, 1957. The Ronettes were two sisters and a cousin.p197 The Supremes were girls from a public housing estate in Detroit, Michigan. They were, and still are, America's most successful vocal group of all time. These groups had managers, of course, because they needed someone to deal with the music industry. But the managers did not set up the groups; they came after the groups were formed.\nLater, almost all groups were created by public relations professionals to meet a market need. The Spice Girls were a good example of this. They were put together in the mid-1990s by a family management team. Their managers' idea was to create a girl group to compete with popular boy bands that dominated the pop music scene in the mid- to late-1990s. The Spice Girls sold most albums, and had the best-selling album of all time.\nOne obvious difference between the earlier groups and the later ones was in their social backgrounds. Earlier American groups, having grown up together, were all of the same social origin and colour. What is more, they had usually sung together, and socialised together, before they formed up as a group. This is also true of most of the earlier British boy groups. The later groups, on the other hand, were deliberately chosen for variety. This was done so that all sections of the audience would have at least one member they could identify with. They had not sung together, or maybe met each other, until their PR manager introduced them.\nWith the changing times, the marketing of popular music changed greatly, so that direct comparison of sales is not simple. but in many parts of the world digital sales are now the most important."}

It is tragic that we have lost one of our nation's finest actors in the prime of his life.\""}

The metic did not have the same citizen rights as a citizen who was born in the state he was living in.\nThe term 'metic' was especially used in ancient Athens in the 4th and 5th centuries BC. A notable metic was Aristotle, who was born in Stageira but lived in Athens for a long time.\nRegardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city, metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift. This was rarely done. Citizenship at Athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay, which could be significant to working people. During emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens. None of these rights were available to metics. They were not permitted to own real estate in Attica, whether farm or house, unless granted a special exemption.\nMetics shared the burdens of citizenship without any of its privileges. Like citizens, they had to perform military service and, if rich enough, were subject to special tax contributions. Citizenship was very rarely granted to metics. More common was the special status of \"equal rights\" (\"isoteleia\") under which they were freed from the usual liabilities.\nThe system came to an end in Hellenistic Athens, when the purchase of citizenship became very frequent. The census of 317 BC gave 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves in Attica.\nIn the Greco-Roman world, free people (non-citizens) living on the territory of a polis were called \"paroikoi\" (see etymology of parish), in Asia Minor \"katoikoi\"."}

Women, slaves, metics and children under the age of 20 were not allowed to become citizens.\nCitizens could be involved in the running of Athens and could be chosen for important positions.

This meant that each citizen had an equal say and opportunity in the governing of Athens. The citizens of Athens would meet on a hillside (the Pnyx) 30 to 40 times a year to discuss how to run the city better. Usually a few thousand actually came to the meeting.\nAll citizens could attend the meetings. People would stand on a raised platform called the bema to speak. Speakers wore a garland whilst speaking. Any citizen could speak.\nAll major decisions concerning the running of Athens were decided here \u2013 taxes, war, policy, etc. Any decisions were made by a show of hands.\nA black pig would be sacrificed to the gods at the start of the meeting to make sure the meeting went well.\nAll democratic countries now have an indirect democracy.

Gucci is seen as one of the most famous, successful, and easily recognizable fashion brands in the world. Gucci is now owned by the French conglomerate company, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR).\nBusinessWeek magazine says that Gucci made more than US$7 billion in 2006, and was 46th in the magazine's yearly \"Top 100 Brands\". For this reason Gucci is the second biggest selling fashion brand after LVMH. Most importantly Gucci is the biggest selling Italian brand in the world. Gucci has about 425 shops in the world and it sells its products to other shops by franchisees and department stores.\nHistory of Gucci.\nGucci was started in 1906 by Guccio Gucci. In 1938, Gucci grew bigger, and a small shop opened in Rome. Guccio Gucci designed many of the company's famous clothes. In 1947, Gucci made the bamboo-handle handbag, which is still used. In the 1950s, Gucci also made the striped webbing (a type of material), and the suede and metal moccasin shoes.\nGuccio Gucci's wife, Aida Calvelli had a large family, with six children, but only their sons (Vasco, Aldo, Ugo, and Rodolfo), not their daughters help lead the company. After Guccio's death in 1953 , Aldo helped lead the company to being a major fashion shop in more than one country, opening the company\u2019s first small shops in London, Paris, and New York. Even in Gucci\u2019s younger years, the family was well known for its arguments. Arguments about inheritances, stock holdings, and day-to-day operations of the shops often divided the family, and caused alliances to be made. Gucci grew in other countries. Gucci decided to grow a lot in East Asia in the late 1960s, opening shops in Hong Kong (China), Tokyo (Japan), and Korea. At that time, the company also made its famous GG logo (Guccio Gucci's initials), and the Flora silk scarf (worn most by Hollywood actress Grace Kelly), and the \"Jackie O shoulder\" bag, which was made famous by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\nGucci stayed as one of the biggest luxury clothes companies in the world, until the late 1970s, when some bad business decisions and family arguments almost made the company bankrupt. At the time, the brothers 'Aldo' and 'Rodolfo' controlled equal 50% shares of the company, but contributed less to the company than Guccio Gucci and all his sons did. In 1979, 'Aldo' made the 'Gucci Accessories Collection', or 'GAC', which was meant to increase sales for the Gucci Parfums sector, which his sons controlled. GAC sold small accessories, such as cosmetic bags, lighters, and pens, which were cheaper than the other items in the company\u2019s accessories catalogue. Aldo relegated control of Parfums to his son Roberto in an effort to weaken Rodolfo\u2019s control of the overall operations of the company.\nAldo Gucci grew into new markets, such as an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC), so that in 1972 AMC Hornet small \"Sportabout\" car became one of the first American cars to give a special luxury made by a famous fashion designer. The Gucci cars had striped green, red, and buff material inside, as well as the Gucci's logos and outside color selections.\nThe \"Gucci Accessories Collection\" was popular, but it brought the Gucci strength down. After a few years, the \"Parfums section\" started to sell better than the \"Accessories section\". The newly-made wholesaling business brought the once-exclusive brand to over a thousand stores in the United States alone with the GAC line, deteriorating the brand\u2019s standing with fashionable customers. \"In the 1960s and 1970s,\" writes Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, \"Gucci had been at the pinnacle of chic, thanks to icons such as Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Jacqueline Onassis. But by the 1980s, Gucci had lost its appeal, becoming a tacky airport brand.\""}
{"id": "89236", "revid": "7629874", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89236", "title": "Ghoul", "text": "A ghoul is a monster from ancient Arabian folklore. Ghouls live in burial grounds and other uninhabited places. The English word comes from the Arabic name for the creature: \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0644 \"gh\u016bl\", which literally means \"demon\". The \"ghul\" is a devilish type of jinn believed to be sired by Iblis.\nThe female form is given as \"ghouleh\" in Muhawi and Kanaana (see ref below). The plural is \"ghilan\".\n\"Ghoul\" is also a shapeshifting demon that lives in the desert. The demon can take the form of an animal, especially a hyena. It lures unwary travellers into the desert. It will then kill and eat them. The creature also preys on young children, robs graves, and eats the dead. Because of this habit the word \"ghoul\" is sometimes used to refer to an ordinary human such as a grave robber, or to anyone who likes the macabre. \nThe star Algol takes its name from this creature.\nIn Iran.\nIn Iranian mythologies, Ghouls are creatures very similar to humans, but larger. Usually they are less intelligent and not necessarily evil.\nMost Persian speakers use Ghoul to describe large people (figuratively \"giants\"). This may or may not be considered an insult, depending on the situation.\nHow ghouls are shown.\nGhouls and ghoul-like creatures have been portrayed in different ways in fiction, including a series of dark fantasy, short stories by Brian McNaughton, a Michael Slade novel, \"Ghoul\", Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" series, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", the works of Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan, Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, and Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files.\nLiterature.\nMorlocks are a fictional species of cannibalistic ghouls, created by H. G. Wells for his 1895 novel, \"The Time Machine\". The Morlocks, as well as another supposed offshoot of humans, the , exist in the future world in the year 802,701 A.D. in \"The Time Machine\".\nBram Stoker's 1897 novel \"Dracula\" has a character that acts much like a ghoul. The character is named Renfield. Under the vampire's influence, Renfield becomes his willing slave. He develops a craving to eat living creatures in the hope of obtaining their life-force for himself. After being confined to an asylum, he considers eating a human hospital orderly, but finds he can only capture and consume flies, spiders, and the occasional bird.\nIn the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, a ghoul is a member of a nocturnal race that lives underground. Some ghouls were once human, but a diet of human corpses, and perhaps the tutelage of proper ghouls, changed them into horrific bestial humanoids. In the short story \"Pickman's Model\" (1927), the first of Lovecraft's ghoul stories, they are unutterably terrible monsters; however, in his earlier novella \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\" (1926), the ghouls are somewhat less disturbing, even comical at times, and both helpful and loyal to the protagonist. Richard Upton Pickman, a noteworthy Boston painter who disappeared mysteriously in \"Pickman's Model\", appears as a ghoul himself in \"Dream-Quest\". Similar themes appear in \"The Lurking Fear\" (1922) and \"The Rats in the Walls\" (1924). Both of stories claim there are subterranean clans of degenerate, cannibals or carrion-eating humans.\nIn modern and contemporary fiction, ghouls are often confused with other types of undead, usually the mindless varieties of zombies. Although modern fiction (post-1954), particularly 1954's \"I Am Legend\", suggests that the latter beings share cannibalistic habits with ghouls, it is nonetheless generally believed that vampires and zombies prefer live prey.\nIn 's Dune series, a \"Ghola\" is a deceased person who has been brought back to life, via a secret, almost illegal Tleilaxu technology. Traditionally, the \"Ghola\" is stripped of memories from his or her past life and taught new skills. \"Ghola\" are often sold to nobles by the Tleilaxu as servants and retainers. Given their highly superstitious nature, Fremen are distrustful of ghola, despite the potential usefulness of the living dead. The ambiguity as to whether or not latent memories of the \"old self\" are still present in the ghola's mind is a long-drawn debate throughout the story. It has been suggested that the term \"ghola\" originates in Arabic, as do other terms in the Dune series.\nMovies and television.\nAlthough many screenplays have featured ghouls, the first major motion picture of this theme was the 1933 British movie entitled \"The Ghoul\". The actor Boris Karloff plays a dying Egyptologist who possesses an occult gem, known as The Eternal Light, which he believes will grant immortality if he is buried with it, and thereby able to present it to Anubis in the afterlife. Of course, his bickering covetous heirs and associates would rather keep the jewel for themselves. Karloff vows to rise from his grave and avenge himself against anyone who meddles with his plan, and he keeps this promise when one of his colleagues steals The Eternal Light after his death.\nIn 1968, George A. Romero's movie \"Night of the Living Dead\" combined reanimated corpses (zombies) with cannibalistic monsters (ghouls). With this, it created new movie monsters more terrifying than either of the two alone. The term \"ghoul\" was the one actually used in the movie. The term zombies came later, after the movie was released. Romero had never thought of them that way; he said he thought of the Caribbean creatures, when he heard the term \"zombies\".\nThe 1976 Turkish movie 'Milk Brothers' (original story by H. Rahmi Gurpinar's 'Ghoul') is a Turkish comedy. Here, a ghoul is a monster with extra power. Ghoul is a monster that was used to frighten little children in the old times, so here the ghoul is used to frighten not only little children, but as well big people.\nThe 1975 British movie \"The Ghoul\" (unrelated to the Karloff movie) stars Peter Cushing as a defrocked missionary whose son has developed a taste for human flesh while traveling in India. As the son's mind and body degenerate, Cushing has several young people dispatched and prepared as food for his offspring, whom he keeps locked up in the attic.\nThe 1975 anthology movie \"The Monster Club\" featured a scene where a village of ghouls stumbled upon by an unwary traveller (Stuart Whitman), who temporarily escapes the creatures with the help of one half-human girl, but he is recaptured when it turns out that the ghouls have representatives inhabiting our normal human world.\nIn the anime and manga series \"Hellsing\", ghouls are zombie-like creatures that are created when a \"chipped\" (technological) vampire drains a victim to death, or, in the Manga, where a vampire drains the blood of someone who is not a virgin. If fatally wounded, they instantly crumble to dust. They are under the control of the vampire who bites them, eat human flesh, and are intelligent enough to use firearms. It is not rare to see a vampire make a small army of Ghouls for attack or defense.\n\"The Ghoul\" is the stage name of Cleveland-area horror television host Ron Sweed.\nThe Batman comics-based franchise, including the 2005 movie, \"Batman Begins\", has an antagonist named, R\u0101's al-Gh\u016bl, whose name derives from the original Arabic name for the star Algol in the constellation Perseus meaning \"the monster's (i.e. Medusa's) head\"."}

It is shown on the satellite and cable channels Living, Living2 and Virgin 1 (Formerly Ftn), mainly for the UK market. It is also shown in the United States on the Travel Channel and on the W Channel in Australia. It is made by Antix Productions, and is led by Yvette Fielding and her husband Karl Beattie.\nThe show will start their 10th series on February 19, 2008.\nProduction.\nThe team travel around the UK, and also Ireland, the Netherlands and the United States, investigating possible paranormal 'hotspots' for 24 hours.\nThe \"Most Haunted\" team.\nMost Haunted has a main presenter, a psychic medium and a parapsychologist. The parapsychologist's role is to be the skeptic, and to give possible scientifical suggestions for the paranormal activity that happens during the night. These are supported by some of the production crew, who appear in the show and generally have some involvement with many parts of the investigation as they are performing their normal crew role. Most of these on-screen crew members also take part in s\u00e9ances.\nThe show has also featured guest mediums. So far these have been Ian Lawman, Ian Shillito, Gordon Smith, Uri Geller and Kevin Wade. Some episodes have also included at least one celebrity. So far celebrities have included Vic Reeves, Nancy Sorrell, Gaby Roslin, Scott Mills, Mark Chapman, Simon Gregson, Sue Cleaver, Carol Thatcher, Paul O'Grady and Lee Ryan.\nFormer team members.\nThe following is a list of former team and crew members who have given a lot of their time to the show.\nControversy.\nMany times, former \"psychic medium\" Derek Acorah was possessed by a spirit, sometimes evil or sometimes \"lost and confused\". One such case that exposed Acorah was at Bodmin Gaol, Cornwall. Before the filming, Acorah had been fed misinformation about a non-existent ghost of Kreed Kafer by the show parapsychologist Dr. Ciaran O' Keeffe. During the investigation, which was later broadcast, he presented the information as fact and even behaved as though being possessed by the fictional ghost. O'Keeffe later revealed Kreed Kafer is an anagram of 'Derek Faker' in a national newspaper. Even though O' Keeffe exposed Acorah, the paper also claimed that O' Keeffe had exposed the rest of the \"Most Haunted\" team. O'Keeffe later reported that he had been grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the article, and produced a response outlining his version of the show based on his observations and findings, saying he had exposed Derek Acorah and NOT \"Most Haunted\". The show's presenter and executive producer, Yvette Fielding said in an interview that she believes it was a fake possession.\nAlthough not mentioned by O'Keeffe, the \"Mirror\" article also brought into question unedited footage which appeared to show Fielding and Karl Beattie faking 'paranormal' occurrences such as ghostly bumps and knocks. Fielding denied the claims. Thus far none of this footage has come to light, leading to the belief that the \"Mirror\"'s claims were false. Videos purporting to show the team faking paranormal activity have often popped up on the web but are conclusively show nothing damning.\nFurther controversy centred on Derek Acorah again in the West Country, this time in Devon. On the first night filming \"Terror in Torbay\", Acorah mentioned a woman incarcerated by her jealous sister in the cellar of Lupton House, even coming up with the names Margaret and Eleanor. In this case, the facts were right, but the location was wrong. This is the well-known legend of Berry Pomeroy Castle which was to be the last night's location. On the final night, at Berry Pomeroy, Fielding reminded Acorah that he had mentioned the incarcerated sister two nights prior. Acorah glossed over his mistake and changed the subject."}

{"id": "89423", "revid": "1072068", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89423", "title": "Opera", "text": "Opera is a drama set to music. An opera is like a play in which everything is sung instead of spoken. Operas are usually performed in opera houses. The singers who sing and act out the story are on the stage, and the orchestra is in front of the stage but lower down, in the orchestra pit, so that the audience can see the stage.\nMusical numbers of an opera.\nAn opera is normally divided into two, three, four or even five acts. In older operas the music was mostly recitative and arias. During the recitative things would happen in the story. The aria was a song for a solo singer, a setting of a lyric. As well as recitative and aria there would be choruses. The chorus were a group of singers who sing in the crowd scenes. The opera would start with an overture for the orchestra. The overture would usually include tunes that are going to be heard later in the opera. \nIn operas from the 19th century onwards there is often little or no difference between recitative and aria. Composers like Wagner wanted to get away from operas which had lots of separate arias in which the singers showed off, with the audience clapping loudly after each one. He wanted continuous music so that the mood would not be broken.\nSometimes operas have a lot of dancing in them. French opera especially would often have one act which was full of dances.\nTypes of opera.\nNot all operas have music all the time.\nGrand opera is opera which is all set to music.\nOp\u00e9ra bouffe (French) or Opera buffa (Italian) is comic opera. The story is very light-hearted and funny.\nOp\u00e9ra comique is a French term for opera which has some spoken words. Surprisingly it does not mean a \u201ccomic\u201d opera. An opera like \"Carmen\", which is a tragedy, is still an op\u00e9ra comique due to the fact that it uses spoken dialogues instead of recitatives.\nSingspiel is a German term for a type of opera with lots of magic and fantasy in the story. There were spoken words between the songs. Mozart\u2019s \"Magic Flute\" is an example.\nOperetta is a short opera which is light-hearted and usually has some spoken words.\nThe singers.\nOpera singers have to have powerful voices as well as a good technique. Most opera houses are very big, and the singers need to be heard at the back. They also need to be good at acting. They need to be able to learn their music quickly and to sing from memory. It is a help to be good at languages because operas are often in Italian, German, French, English or Russian etc. Some opera companies, like the English National Opera, sing their operas in English. Others, like the Royal Opera House, sing operas in whatever language they were composed in. Translations are printed on a screen above the front of the stage (\"surtitles\") so that the audience can understand what is being sung.\nAlthough singers train to get a wide range (good top and bottom notes) they cannot be expected to sing any role in their voice range. For example: some sopranos may have big, dramatic voices, suitable for parts like Tosca in Puccini\u2019s opera \"Tosca\". Some may have a very light and high voice, called \u201ccoloratura\u201d, suitable for parts like the Queen of the Night in Mozart\u2019s \"Magic Flute\". Some may have a medium range, called mezzo-soprano, suitable for parts like Carmen in Bizet\u2019s opera \"Carmen\".\nVery often in opera the heroine is a soprano and the hero is a tenor. Basses may often have the part of a powerful king, or he may be the bad guy.\nOperatic conventions.\nThe 18th century lexicographer and critic Dr Johnson described opera as an \u201cexotic and irrational entertainment\u201d. By \u201cexotic\u201d he meant that it came from a foreign country (which in those days was true: all opera at the time came from Italy). By \u201cirrational\u201d he meant that the things which happened in the stories were strange and not like real life. A play can be like real life, but an opera is being sung, so things are not going to happen like they normally do in real life. A singer might be singing \u201cI must go, I must go!\u201d and he may stand on the stage and sing this for several minutes before at last he goes! A singer may be pretending to die, and will sing a beautiful song before he or she finally dies. These things are \u201cconventions\u201d, which means that they are a kind of habit we have to accept when watching and listening to opera. Another convention of earlier operas was to have the part of young men sung by women. This is sometimes called a breeches role or trouser role. They are often small parts such as page boys, or teenagers who flirt with older women, such as the part of Cherubino in Mozart\u2019s \" The Marriage of Figaro\" or Oktavian in Richard Strauss\u2019s \"Der Rosenkavalier\". It should be remembered that in the 18th century it was usual for the main female part to be sung by a man who was a castrato.\nThere are lots of famous operas, and the best ones have some of the greatest music ever written. The music could not have been written like that if it had not been written for opera. For example: Mozart is very clever at writing music where maybe six people are all singing different things at once because they all have different ideas about the situation in the story.\nThe history of opera.\nMedieval Opera (mid 12th century)\nOne of the first operas ever written was by Hildegard of Bingen. Ordo Virtutum (Latin for \"Order of the Virtues\") is an allegorical , or , composed c. 1151, during the construction and relocation of Bingen's Abbey at Rupertsberg. It is the earliest morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.\nA short version of \"Ordo Virtutum\" without music appears at the end of \"\", Hildegard's most famous account of her visions. It is also included in some manuscripts of the \"Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum\" (\"Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations\"), a cycle of more than 70 liturgical songs. It may have been performed by the convent nuns at the dedication of the St. church in 1152 or possibly before the at the convent .\nBaroque opera (1600-1750).\nThe first Baroque opera ever written was performed in 1597 in Florence in Italy. It was called \"Dafne\" and the composer was Jacopo Peri. This opera is now lost, but three years later, in 1600, he worked together with another composer called Giulio Caccini to write an opera called \"Euridice\". The music for this still exists. It was nearly all recitative. This kind of writing was new, but if opera was to tell a story it was important to have a solo voice singing words that could be heard. They were trying to produce something like an ancient Greek tragedy. It was performed at a kind of club, called \u201ccamerata\u201d, for intellectual (clever) people to a small audience. It was not great music, but the amazing thing was that there was a composer of genius around. His name was Claudio Monteverdi, and only seven years later, in 1607, he wrote the first really good opera: \"Orfeo\", which was produced in Mantua. Monteverdi must have realized that opera had the possibilities of putting poetry, music, scenery and acting all together. He took the kind of songs that were popular at the time and joined them with speaking or recitative. Later in life he joined these so that the music flowed more dramatically.\nIn 1637 the first public opera house was opened in Venice. Soon lots of theatres in Italy started to produce operas. The stories were usually about ancient times, like the Roman Empire or Greek myths. They started to put in comic (funny) bits to make people laugh. Soon there was opera in Paris, Vienna, Hamburg and in the small courts of Germany which in those days was lots of little countries, each with their own prince who ruled and who kept musicians at court. The composers who are best remembered today include Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687) who was an Italian who moved to France and wrote operas for the French king, and George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) who was a German who moved to England and wrote operas for the opera houses in London. In Italy there were composers like Francesco Cavalli (1602-1676) who had been a choirboy in Monteverdi\u2019s church choir in Venice, and Alessandro Scarlatti 1660-1725 who lived in Naples.\nDuring this period, known as the Baroque period, the opera was an entertainment for the upper classes who went to the opera to be seen in public. Opera was a social occasion where you could meet people and talk, even during the music. Both the singers and the audience behaved in ways that we would think were bad manners.\nClassical opera (late 18th century).\nChristoph Willibald Gluck was a composer who tried to make people take opera more seriously. In 1762 he wrote an opera called \"\" which was performed in Vienna. It had lots of choruses and ballet numbers, like French opera, but the words were in Italian and the music really concentrated on the story rather than being just a display for clever singers to show off. Some of its music is very famous today, e.g. the \"Dance of the Blessed Spirits\" which is played on a flute, and Orfeo\u2019s aria \"Che far\u00f3 senza Euridice?\" (\"What shall I do without Euridice?\").\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart learned from Gluck\u2019s ideas about opera. This can be seen in his opera \"Idomeneo\" which is about a Greek story. Other Italian operas by Mozart include: \"Don Giovanni\", \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" and \"Cosi fan tutte\". He also wrote operas in German: \"The Abduction from the Serail\" and \"The Magic Flute\". These are Singspiel: operas which tell magic and fantasy stories.\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) only wrote one opera: \"Fidelio\". It is a story of a woman who rescues her lover from prison. Rescue operas were popular in France, but this one is in German. It is a serious opera about how a woman can save a man by being true and faithful.\nRomantic opera (19th century).\nIn the 19th century Richard Wagner (1813-1883) continued Gluck\u2019s ideas. Wagner had very personal ideas about how his operas should be performed, and he liked to train the singers himself. He wanted them to take the drama of his operas seriously instead of treating the music as a way of showing off their voices. He always wrote the libretti (words for the opera) himself, and they were always in German. They are mostly about serious subjects from German folklore and myths, although he did write one comic opera: \"The Mastersingers of N\u00fcrnberg\". Wagner used \u201cleitmotifs\u201d which means that there are tunes which are used for particular characters or ideas in the opera. This allows the music to develop with the story, and can be used in interesting ways. For example: when Sigmund (in the opera \"Die Walk\u00fcre\") says that he does not know who his father is, we hear his father\u2019s tune in the orchestra! The audience, of course, know (this is called: dramatic irony).\nIn Italy Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) wrote lots of operas. There was no difference in style between his comic and his serious operas. Often the same overture was used for both. He wrote exactly all the notes that the singers were to sing, he did not want to leave it to them to improvise their own ornamental notes. Everything was carefully thought out. Musicians are not sure whether to call him a Classical or Romantic composer. Composers like Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835) and Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848) are definitely Romantic. They had the ability to write lovely lyrical tunes. The most famous Italian opera composer of the 19th century was Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). His music is not always continuous like Wagner\u2019s. Sometimes it stopped for the audience to applaud. Verdi had a wonderful sense of drama, and could write beautiful melodies which captured people\u2019s hearts. He loved Shakespeare, and based several of his operas on Shakespeare plays: \"Othello\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Falstaff\". \nThe 19th century was the time when Nationalism was important. Composers were writing music typical of their own countries. Wagner, as we have seen, took German myths for his opera stories. In Spain they had their own kind of opera called \u201czarzuela\u201d. In Russia Mikhail Glinka (1804-1857) wrote \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" which was based on a Russian fairy tale. Other Russian composers include Alexander Borodin who wrote \"Prince Igor\", and Modest Mussorgsky (1839-1881) who wrote \"Boris Godunov\". Both these operas are about stories from Russian history. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908) wrote a fairy tale opera \"Sadko\", and Pyotr Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) used some very Russian tunes in \"Eugene Onegin\" and \"The Queen of Spades\". \nCzech composers wrote national operas. The most famous Czech opera composers were Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (1841-1904), Bed\u0159ich Smetana (1824-1884) and Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek (1854-1928). In France the most famous composer was Charles Gounod (1818-1893) who wrote an opera called \"Faust\".\nOpera in the 20th century.\nIn the 20th century composers had many different styles of composing. This was true of all kinds of music, including opera. Richard Strauss (1864-1949) was really a Romantic, although almost all his operas were written in the 20th century. His harmonies show that he had studied Wagner\u2019s operas. \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (1909) has lots of romantic tunes, although it is a story about Vienna in the Classical period. In Italy composers like Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924) wrote operas in the verismo style. This meant operas with stories that felt like real life. The characters in the stories were usually from the lower classes. \nAlban Berg (1885-1935) also wrote operas about poor or simple people. He wrote an opera called \"Wozzeck\" which is the tragedy of a man who is too simple to understand that people are being unkind to him and using him. Berg\u2019s music is often built on the twelve tone series which he had learned from Schoenberg. Stravinsky\u2019s (1882-1971) \"The Rake's Progress\" is in yet another style called Neo-classical because the music is made to sound a bit like music of the Classical Period. In England Britten wrote many great operas like \"Peter Grimes\" and \"Billy Budd\". In Russia Dmitri Shostakovich wrote \"Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District\". Most of them are about unfortunate people who want to be part of society but are not accepted. \nMore recent composers who wrote operas include the Hungarian Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti (1923-2006), the Polish Krzysztof Penderecki (b.1933), the English Sir Harrison Birtwistle and the Americans Philip Glass (b.1937) and John Adams (b.1947)."}

{"id": "89514", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89514", "title": "WWE Championship", "text": "The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling world championship in WWE. It is the first world title of WWE. The title is said to be the biggest prize in professional wrestling and millions of people around the world watch matches for it.\nHistory.\nBeginning.\nThe WWE World Championship was created in 1963, and Buddy Rogers became the first world champion on April 29. It may have been created because of things that happened in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) which is a wrestling company (or promotion) that had many \"territories\" in North America and some around the world. In the 1950s, Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was an NWA territory, and in 1963, people in CWC had a lot of control over the rest of the NWA. During this time, Buddy Rogers held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the world title of the NWA, until Lou Thesz defeated Rogers for the championship on January 24, 1963. After an argument over who should have won, CWC left the NWA and created a new promotion called the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The new company then made up a story for its new title, and said that the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was separated from the NWA World Championship, and there was a tournament in Rio de Janeiro to decide a new champion. They said that Buddy Rogers won this tournament, by beating Antonino Rocca in the finals. (The tournament actually did not happen.) The WWWF came back to the NWA once again, and the WWWF was renamed to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979. After WWF left the NWA forever in 1983 the championship was named the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and later the WWF World Championship or WWF Championship in the 1990s.\nImportance.\nIn 1991, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), another NWA territory, created the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and it was just as important as the NWA world title. WCW then left the NWA and became a rival promotion to the WWF. Both promotions became popular, and fought the \"Monday Night Wars\". This was a fight to see who could get better ratings on TV. Near the end of the ratings war, WCW started to lose money, and the Monday Night Wars ended in March 2001 with WWF buying WCW. After that, WWF had all of WCW's videos, some of their wrestlers and championships, and other things. The group of wrestlers who were in WCW joining the WWF was called \"The Invasion\". After this, the WCW World Championship was made one with the WWF World Championship, at Vengeance 2001 in December. At the show, Chris Jericho beat The Rock to win the WCW World Championship, and Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WWF World Championship. Because of this, Chris Jericho was the last WCW World Champion and the Undisputed WWF World Champion as there was no dispute over what the most important prize in professional wrestling was anymore.\nUndisputed World Championship and going back to a normal world championship.\nBy 2002, the number of wrestlers in WWE was twice as big because they now had wrestlers from WWF before the end of WCW, and wrestlers who came from WCW and ECW. As a result of the increase, the WWF split its wrestlers in halves with each half performing on one of WWE's two weekly TV shows - \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\". Each show also had different championships and bosses. This was called the Brand Extension. In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the championship was called the WWE Undisputed World Championship. After these changes, the WWE Undisputed Championship was not on \"Raw\" or \"SmackDown\" and wrestlers from both brands could challenge the WWE Undisputed World Champion. When Eric Bischoff became the General Manager of \"Raw\" and Stephanie McMahon became the General Manager of \"SmackDown\", McMahon brought the WWE Undisputed World Champion at the time, Brock Lesnar to the \"SmackDown\" brand, and left the Raw brand without a world title. On September 2, after arguing about the brand that the Undisputed Championship should be on, Eric Bischoff announced the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship, separate from the Undisputed Championship. Then, the WWE Undisputed World Championship was called the WWE World Championship or just the WWE Championship. In 2011, There were two WWE Champions - John Cena and CM Punk. On the August 1 episode of Raw the Chief Operating Officer of WWE Triple H, announced a match to decide who will be the WWE Champion between Cena and Punk. At SummerSlam, Punk beat Cena to be the only WWE Champion, but that night Alberto Del Rio cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and became the new WWE Champion. The holder of the contract gets a WWE or World Heavyweight Championship match whenever they want. (They could also get an ECW Championship when that title was around)\nOn December 15, 2013, Randy Orton beat Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship at . He was already WWE Champion when he won the championship and made the World Heavyweight Championship one with the WWE Championship to make the \"WWE World Heavyweight Championship\". Wrestlers stopped fighting for the World Heavyweight Championship the next day. The title was renamed the WWE World Championship because the WWE Universal Championship is on \"Raw\" and the original title is on \"SmackDown\" \"Live\". Soon after, it was changed back to the WWE Championship.\nBrands.\nAfter the WWE Brand Extension, WWE started having drafts each year, where some wrestlers change brands. After three years on the \"SmackDown\" brand, the WWE Championship switched brands during the 2005 draft, when the WWE Champion John Cena was sent to \"Raw\" while the World Heavyweight Champion Batista was sent to \"SmackDown\". On June 11, 2006, Rob Van Dam used his Money in the Bank contract at ECW One Night Stand for a WWE Championship match against Cena. Van Dam beat Cena to win the WWE Championship, moving the title to the \"ECW\" brand, a brand WWE created after buying the Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion. On July 3, Edge beat Cena and Van Dam in a Triple Threat Match to win the WWE Championship and with Edge on the \"Raw\" brand at the time, Edge brought the title back to Raw. After the 2008 WWE Draft, the WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to \"SmackDown\", moving the WWE Championship to the \"SmackDown\" brand. The following year, the title returned to Raw after Triple H was drafted back to \"Raw\" during the 2009 WWE Draft, and the championship stayed there. When \"SmackDown\"'s Batista won the title from \"Raw\"'s John Cena at Elimination Chamber, it still stayed on \"Raw\" because Batista was sent there.\nFrom August 2011 to July 2016, all WWE TV programming became \"Supershows\" that had wrestlers from both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". This meant that the WWE Championship matches could happen at any WWE event. The brand extension came back in 2016 and the WWE Champion at the time Dean Ambrose was drafted to \"SmackDown Live\" and the championship has been there ever since.\nCustom belt designs.\nSpecial belts have been made to match the characters of some champions:\nA much bigger version of the belt was created for Andr\u00e9 the Giant before WrestleMania III, but he never wore it as champion. The belt Brahma Bull logo in the center that was made for the Rock was lost and was never on TV. Edge had created a special belt different from the \"Rated R Spinner\" one that he used for his second reign, but the plans were scrapped because of little time.\nA special belt is being used by Daniel Bryan right now. His belt replaces the black leather strap of the normal belt with wood and fabric. This is to match his vegan character."}

It used to be a part of Poland. It was also known as Sofievka or Zofi\u00f3wka in Polish, named after Sofia, a Russian princess who donated land for the Jewish settlement.\nHistory.\nTrochenbrod was founded in 1835, at first a farming colony which grew into a small town. The population grew from around 1,200 (235 families) in 1889 to 1,580 in 1897.\nDuring the Polish-Soviet War, the town was captured by Poland. By 1938 the town's population, which was only Jewish, had grown to at least 3,000. Most of the people worked in farming, dairy farming, or tanning. \nThere were seven synagogues in Trochenbrod. In 1940, the town, along with the rest of Western Ukraine, became part of the Soviet Union (see Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). The rabbi at this time was Rabbi Gershon Weissmann. The Communists exiled him to Siberia after accusing him of being involved in underground salt trading.\nWhen the Nazis later occupied Ukraine, they created a ghetto at Trochenbrod, bringing in Jews from nearby villages and towns. The Jews in the Trochenbrod ghetto were killed by the Nazis in August and September 1942. Most of the Jews of Trochenbrod as well as of the neighbouring village Lozisht were killed, as were the other Jews of Volhynia. The local Ukrainian police force helped to round up the Jews. Fewer than 200 Jews from the Trochenbrod ghetto and nearby areas lived through this killing. The village itself was burned. Now only fields and a forest can be found there.\nA few of the people escaped the execution and destruction. At the end of the war, the number of people left was between 33 and 40; most were found in the area near Lutzk.\nTrochenbrod in fiction.\nA fictional version of the shtetl, \"Trachimbrod\", was featured in the 2002 novel \"Everything Is Illuminated\" by Jonathan Safran Foer as well as in the 2005 film based on the novel.\nSafran Foer's story describes fictional events in the village between 1791, the year in which the shtetl was first named, and 1941, when it was destroyed in the war. The main character of the book (who goes by the author's name and also by the name \"The Hero\") comes to Ukraine to look for a woman named Augustine, who saved his grandfather in the war."}

It was written in or near 100 b.c.e. It is in Bibles that follow the Catholic and Orthodox Canon. Protestants and Jews treat the Book of Judith as part of the apocrypha and not part of the official canon.\nIn the book, an evil general named Holofernes is invading Israel. He is waiting with his army outside the town of Bethulia and will not let the people in the town get any water to drink. Judith tells the people of Bethulia not to give up. She sneaks to Holofernes' camp and pretends to make friends with him. He invites her to a meal, where he drinks much alcohol. When he falls asleep, she cuts off his head.\nHistory.\nThe Book of Judith is probably not a story about something that really happened. The book says that Holofernes was an Assyrian who worked for Nebuchadnezzar, but the real Nebuchadnezzar was a Babylonian ruler.\nThe book starts with, \"In the twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned over the Assyrians in Nineveh.\" Many ancient Hebrew stories started with words like these. It is like saying \"once upon a time\": it tells the reader to expect a fairy tale.\nIn culture.\nMany, many artists have painted paintings of Judith killing or preparing to kill Holofernes. For example, Artemisia Gentileschi and Gustav Klimt."}

Lassus and Palestrina are the two most famous composers of that time who were writing church music in a polyphonic style. \nLife.\nHe was born in Mons in the province of Hainaut in the Low Countries which is mostly what is today the south part of the Netherlands and Belgium. We know very little about his childhood. There is a story that, when he was a choirboy, he was abducted three times by another church who wanted him to sing in their choir because he had a beautiful voice. There is no proof that this story is true. At the age of twelve he left his country and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later to Milan in Italy and then to Naples where he worked until the early 1550s. Next he moved to Rome, where he worked for the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had a large household there. In 1553, he became \"maestro di cappella\" of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome. This was an excellent job for a man who was only 21 years old. However, he only stayed there a year. Later, in 1555, Palestrina took that job. Lassus left Rome to go home to the Low Countries to see his parents who were ill, but by the time he got home they were both dead.\nWe are not sure what he did between then and 1554. He may have gone to France and England. In 1555 he returned to the Low Countries and had some of his first works published in Antwerp. In 1556 he joined the court of Duke Albert V of Bavaria who was very keen on music and was trying to make music in his country as good as the music in Italy. Lassus was one of several Netherlanders to work there, and by far the most famous. He seems to have been happy in Munich and he stayed there. In 1558 he married the daughter of a maid of honour of the Duchess; they had two sons who both became composers. By 1563 Lassus had been made \"maestro di cappella\". He stayed there for the rest of his life, although several other kings and aristocrats offered him jobs in other places. He had many honours, including being knighted by the Pope.\nIn 1590 his health started to be bad. In 1594 his employer decided it was costing him too much to employ Lassus, so he wrote a letter to him to say that he was dismissed (that he no longer had a job). Lassus never saw the letter, because that very same day he died.\nHis music.\nLassus composed a lot of church music. He had to compose masses for the morning and evening services. Many of these are parody masses, which means they were based on tunes from other compositions. Others were influenced by composers from Venice. \nHe wrote many motets which were probably sung at services as well. In some of these motets he shows a sense of humour. For example, one of his motets makes fun about bad singers: the music stops and starts and stutters. It was a kind of musical joke. Sometimes he had to write music for special occasions. He had visited Italy several times and learned the Italian way of writing polyphonic music.\nLassus also wrote many songs in French (chansons) as well as German (Lieder). He also wrote madrigals. He even wrote drinking songs.\nHe never wrote anything that was strictly instrumental music."}

Kannur district derived its name from the location of its headquarters at Kannur town. The old name \u2018Cannanore\u2019 is the anglicised form of the Malayalam word Kannur. According to one opinion, \u2018Kannur\u2019 is a derivation from Kanathur, an ancient village, the name of which survives even today in one of the wards of Kannur Municipality. Another version is that Kannur might have assumed its name from one of the , deities of the Hindu pantheon, a compound of two words, Kannan (Lord Krishna) and Ur (place) making it the place of Lord Krishna. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the deity of the Katalayi Sreekrishna temple was originally installed in a shrine at Katalayi Kotta in the south eastern part of the present Kannur town.\nHistory.\nThe earliest evidence of human habitation in the district are rock-cut caves and megalithic burial sites of the Neolithic age. The Taliparamba-Kannur-Thalassery area abounds in rock-cut caves, dolmens, burial stone circles and menhirs, all of megalithic burial order. The district was part of the Chera kingdom, which ruled most of Kerala during the first several centuries CE. Later Kannur was the capital of the Kolattiri Rajas, whose kingdom had trading relations with Arabia and Persiain the 12th century and 13th centuries.\nKannur District witnessed one of the longest and bloodiest resistance to British rule in India. This revolt led by Pazhassi Raja in the 1792\u20131806 period kept a large part of the district in a state of war.\nKannur District played an important role in the Indian freedom movement. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, established a Malabar District committee in 1908. A branch of the All India Home Rule League, founded by Dr. Annie Besant, functioned in Thalassery during this period and among its active workers was V.K. Krishna Menon. By the end of 1939, a branch of the Communist Party of India was formally established at Pinarayi, a village near Thalassery."}

During the New Kingdom Egypt was richer and more powerful than in all other periods of its history. It includes the Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties.\nEgypt expanded far south into Nubia and held wide territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria and Egyptian territory reached its maximum extent.\nImportant Pharaohs.\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty was ruled by some of Egypt's most famous Pharaohs including Akhenaten and Tutankhamun. Queen Hatshepsut concentrated on expanding Egypt's external trade and sent a commercial expedition to the land of Punt. Thutmose III (\"the Napoleon of Egypt\") expanded Egypt's army and created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen.\nAmenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten in honor of the Aten.

It was made in the Soviet Union by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Every member of the Party was supposed to follow these rules. So was every member of the \"Komsomol\" (a Communist group for young people ages 14-28).\nHistory.\nThe Moral Code was written at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961. It was part of the third CPSU Program, which was a plan for how to make the entire Soviet Union communist as part of the new Party Programme.\nSome popular Soviet cliches are written in the Code. In fact, the Code was written to include special phrases, either invented by Soviet thinkers, or borrowed. (For example, the famous quote \"'One for all, and all for one\" (\"\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445, \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\") was taken from \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re.)\nThe Moral Code.\nThe Moral Code of the Builder of Communism (as reported on Wikisource), with simple English explanations below, is:\n1. Devotion to the cause of Communism, love of the socialist Motherland and of the socialist countries.\n2. Conscientious labor for the good of society: he who does not work, neither shall he eat.\n3. Concern on the part of everyone for the preservation and growth of public property.\n4. High sense of public duty; intolerance of actions harmful to the public interest.\n5. Collectivism and comradely mutual assistance: one for all and all for one.\n6. Humane relations and mutual respect between individuals: man is to man a friend, a comrade, and a brother.\n7. Honesty and truthfulness, moral purity, unpretentiousness and modesty in social and private life.\n8. Mutual respect in the family, concern for the upbringing of children.\n9. Irreconcilability towards injustice, parasitism, dishonesty, careerism, and profiteering.\n10. Friendship and brotherhood among all peoples of the USSR, intolerance of national and racial hatred.\n11. Intolerance towards the enemies of communism, peace, and freedom of nations.\n12. Fraternal solidarity with the working people of all countries, and with all peoples.\nComparisons to religion.\nThese rules may be compared to the Ten Commandments or the Bible. For example, the Bible says: \"he who does not work, neither shall he eat\" (2 Thessalonians 3:10). This line was used in the Soviet Constitution of 1936 as well as the Moral Code. Another example is the Commandment \"you shall not commit adultery.\" This is similar to the Code's rule about \"mutual respect in a family, concern about the upbringing of children.\"\nThe Ten Commandments focus more on personal virtue - what a person should do, and how to treat other people. The Code talks about how people should act as members of the society they live in.\nA Russian legislator and Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, said the moral code could be compared to the Sermon on the Mount."}

This is usually done for religious or political motives. Often, it occurs together with major political or religious changes. It is generally distinct from destruction by foreigners, for example by Spanish conquistadors in America. The term does not generally include the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (\"damnatio memoriae\"), for example Akhenaten in Ancient Egypt. \nPeople who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts. This word is also used for people who are against established dogmata or conventions. Similarly, people who revere or venerate religious images are called idolators. In an Eastern Orthodox context they are known as iconodules, or iconophiles.\nIconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. The two Byzantine outbreaks during the 8th and 9th centuries were unusual because the use of images was the main issue in the dispute, rather than a by-product of wider concerns. In Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by a literal interpretation of the Ten Commandments, which forbid the making and worshipping of \"graven images\" of God."}

It is one of many denominations to come out of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) in 1995. The Worldwide Church of God was started by Herbert W. Armstrong.\nUCG calls itself \"The United Church of God, \"an International Association\"\", with the last three words italicized. This is so people do not confuse it with other churches. UCG is its own denomination.\nBeginning.\nAfter Herbert Armstrong's death in 1986, leaders in the WCG began to change the teachings of the church. This started in 1994. They changed the teachings to be more like other Christian churches. Many of the members wished to keep the original teachings, which they believed were the same beliefs as the early church of the First Century. Because of this, they left to start their own churches. UCG was established in May 1995 and is the largest church to come out of the WCG.\nUCG began when former WCG ministers met in Indianapolis, Indiana in the spring of 1995. The were concerned about the changing teachings of the church. UCG's first president was David Hulme. He was later removed from office because he refused to move the church's home office to Ohio in 1998, among other reasons. After this, he started a new church called \"Church of God, an International Community.\" After Hulme, church elders elected other new presidents. They elected Les McCullough in 1998, Roy Holladay in 2002, Clyde Kilough in 2005 and Dennis Luker in 2010. Victor Kubik was elected to serve for three years in May 2013.\nGovernment.\nUCG is led by twelve men called the \"Council of Elders\". They are elected by a group of church ministers called the \"General Conference of Elders.\" This is not like the WCG, which was led by one man only. The General Conference of Elders meets once a year in May to decide how money should be spent and how the church should be run. They also decide the teachings of the church and go to seminars. The council meets four times a year.\nUCG's \"Home Office\" and is in Milford, Ohio, (a suburb of Cincinnati). This office is led by UCG's President, who is also the church's main spokesperson. He also leads the church's ministers and controls the printing of the church magazine, newsletter, and booklets. He is elected by the Council of Elders (COE) and can be removed by them.\nTeachings.\nThe UCG believes and worships like many other Christian churches, except:\nAmbassador Bible College.\nAmbassador Bible College (ABC) is an in-depth nine-month program where students can learn about the Bible, Christian living and the teachings of the United Church of God. The program also prepares young people to lead and serve, and it prepares them to teach future generations. Students study church teaching and all the books of the Bible thoroughly.\nMission and Media.\nUCG states: \"The mission of the Church of God is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God in all the world, make disciples in all nations and care for those disciples.\" Their goal is to preach about \"The Kingdom of God\" to everyone, through the UCG website, through Twitter and YouTube, and through radio, magazines, booklets, and television.\nUCG produces the following:\nUCG also has 33 booklets on different Bible teachings, and a 12-lesson Bible study course. It also has a monthly Bible reading program where the Bible is explained, and a number of articles. \"Kingdom of God Bible seminars\" began in September 2011 and are held at different locations around the world."}

It is against the law to use this number if there is no emergency. \nHistory.\nBefore 1961, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; each of the different emergency branches (police, fire department or ambulance) had their own number. In 1961, the Postmaster General (PMG) introduced the Triple Zero (000) number in most of the major Australian cities and by the end of the 1980s it had become nation-wide.

There are 107 of these Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte.\nThis makes a total of 402 districts.\nIn North Rhine-Westphalia, there are some cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants which are not urban districts, for example Iserlohn, Recklinghausen, Siegen, Paderborn, Bergisch Gladbach, Witten and Neuss. These cities belong to a district, but still do so the districts jobs themselves, as though they were independent.\nResponsibilities.\nThe districts are responsible for the following:\nAll these tasks are carried out by local (municipal) authorities operating together.

Rural districts provide services for the smaller towns and villages in an area. In some states the towns and villages in a district are joined into \u00e4mter (although \"amt\" is not always the name used). This is because the towns and villages in the area are too small to provide the local services (for example fire brigade or cemeteries). If the \"Amt\" system is used towns or settlements might be \"amtfrei\" that is, not part of an amt because the town can handle its own local affairs.\nIn some states there is another level of government, the Regierungsbezirk or governmental district. Several urban and rural districts are joined to make a regierungsbezirk, which does some of their jobs, especially things like land-use planning which can affect several districts."}

She was crowned queen when she was only 6 days old. She went to live in France when she was very young. Scotland would be ruled by \"regents\" until she was 18 years old. The first regent was the Earl of Arran. After 1554, the regent was Mary's mother, Mary of Guise.\nKing Henry VIII of England tried to get Lord Arran to agree that Mary would marry his son. This led to a series of battles called the \"Rough Wooing\". In the end, Lord Arran turned to the French for help. Lord Arran and King Henry II of France agreed that France would protect Scotland if Mary could marry the King's son Francis. When she was 15 years old, Mary married Francis, who was now King Francis II of France. But their marriage was short. Francis became very ill and later died from an ear infection that had spread to his brain, leaving Mary a widow shortly before her 18th birthday.\nWhen Mary was born, Scotland was a Catholic country. While she was living in France, Protestant ideas were spreading to Scotland. Her mother tried to stop this but could not. In 1560, the Parliament of Scotland said it wanted Scotland to be a Protestant country.\nReign in Scotland.\nIn 1561, Mary returned to Scotland. She found that she was not popular in her kingdom. She had been brought up as a Catholic, but many people in Scotland had become Protestant. It was difficult for Mary to avoid siding with either the Catholics or the Protestants. As Mary was now free to marry again, there were lots of noblemen who wanted to become her husband. For her second husband, she chose an English lord named Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was of royal blood. Darnley was good-looking and charming, but he was often very childish, and he was jealous of Mary's secretary, an Italian named David Rizzio.\nMary became pregnant. While she was expecting the baby, Darnley and his friends got drunk one night and decided to kill David Rizzio. They came into Mary's private rooms at Holyrood Palace while she was talking with Rizzio and they stabbed him to death. Darnley got away with the murder because he was the queen's husband, but Mary never forgave him for murdering her friend Rizzio and avoided being with him again. When her baby was born, it was a boy, who would later become King James VI of Scotland.\nIn 1567, Darnley was murdered. James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell was put on trial for the murder but found not guilty. He was a powerful Scottish nobleman who was loyal to Mary and hated Darnley. Mary then married him. This caused her problems, because Bothwell had many enemies and many still believed he had murdered Darnley. Mary's enemies forced her off the throne and made her young son king in her place. Mary was put in prison in Loch Leven Castle. She escaped and crossed the border into England, which was ruled by her cousin, Elizabeth, Queen of England.\nImprisonment and execution.\nMary hoped that Elizabeth would help her to get her throne back, but Elizabeth did not since it was always believed that Mary would try to take the throne from her. She kept Mary a prisoner for many years. Mary was eventually accused of making plans to murder Elizabeth. A jury of thirty noblemen convicted her of treason and she was executed.\nEven though Elizabeth signed the death warrant, she put it off for a long time as she was not comfortable with executing someone who was both a family member and another queen."}

He was the most important composer of his time. He belonged to the group of composers known as the Burgundian School. He had more influence on music in Europe than any other composer of the 15th century.\nLife.\nFrom what it says in his will it seems likely that he was born in Beersel which is near Brussels in what, today, is Belgium. He was the illegitimate child of an unknown priest and a woman called Marie Du Fayt. When he was small, Dufay moved with his mother to Cambrai where they stayed with a relative who was a canon of the cathedral there. Dufay soon showed musical talent, and he was given a musical education at the cathedral. He sang in the choir there. When he was only 16 he was given a benefice as chaplain near Cambrai. He travelled to Konstanz for a meeting.\nFrom November 1418 to 1420 he was a subdeacon at Cambrai Cathedral. In 1420 he left Cambrai again, and worked in Rimini in Italy at the house of a rich family. In 1424 he returned to Cambrai because the relative in whose house his mother was staying was ill. After the relative died he went back to Italy. He worked in Bologna for a cardinal. He became a deacon and then a priest.\nWhen the Cardinal was made to leave Bologna in 1428 Dufay went to Rome to work for the pope. He became a member of the Papal Choir. In 1434 he was made \"maistre de chappelle\" in Savoy. He seems to have left Rome when the papal choir had money problems. Yet in 1435 he was again in the service of the papal chapel, but this time it was in Florence. In 1436 Dufay composed the festive motet \"Nuper rosarum flores\", one of his most famous compositions, which was sung at the dedication of Brunelleschi's dome of the cathedral in Florence.\nDuring this period Dufay also began his long association with the d'Este family in Ferrara, some of the most important musical patrons of the Renaissance. He may have got to know them during his first stay in Italy. Rimini was not far from Ferrara, and he spent time in both towns where he got financial support.\nAt this time the arguments between the Pope and the Council of Basel continued. Dufay thought he might find himself without a job, so he went back to Cambrai. In order to be a canon at Cambrai, he needed a law degree, which he got in 1437; he may have studied at Turin University in 1436. One of the first documents mentioning him in Cambrai is dated December 27, 1440, when he was given 36 lots of wine for the feast of St. John the Evangelist. We do not know how long he took to drink it.\nDufay stayed in Cambrai during the 1440s. At the same time he was also in the service of the Duke of Burgundy. While in Cambrai he worked with Nicolas Grenon on completely renewing the cathedral collection of music. This meant that he had to write a big collection of polyphonic music for services. He also worked in the administration of the cathedral. In 1444 his mother died, and was buried in the cathedral; and in 1445 Dufay moved into the house of the person who had been canon just before. He kept this home for the rest of his life, although he did spend six more years in Italy where he wrote many of his compositions. When he returned again to Cambrai he was made canon of the cathedral. He was the most famous composer in Europe by that time. He often composed music for the court of Burgundy, and he met many younger composers who were becoming famous, such as Busnois, Ockeghem, Tinctoris, and Loyset Comp\u00e8re. During this period Dufay probably wrote his mass based on the song \"L'homme arm\u00e9\", as well as the chanson based on the same song. Maybe he wrote this when Philip the Good called for a new crusade against the Turks, who had recently captured Constantinople. He also wrote a Requiem mass around 1460, which is lost.\nAfter an illness of several weeks, Dufay died on November 27, 1474. He had asked for his motet \"Ave regina celorum\" to be sung for him as he died, with pleas for mercy to be read between some of the movements, but there was not enough time for this to be arranged, so it was sung at his funeral instead. Dufay was buried in the chapel of St. Etienne in the cathedral of Cambrai; his portrait was carved onto his tombstone. In later years the cathedral was destroyed, and the tombstone was lost, but it was found in 1859 (it was being used to cover a well), and is now in the Palais des Beaux Arts museum in Lille.\nMusic and influence.\nDufay\u2019s music was performed all over Europe. People who wanted to perform his music had to write it out by hand. There was no music printing in those days.\nDufay wrote church music including masses, motets, Magnificats, hymns, simple chant settings and antiphons. His secular (non-religious) music includes rondeaux, ballades, virelais and a few other kinds of chanson. His style of composition laid the foundation for the next generations of Renaissance composers. Some of his techniques were old-fashioned. He used isorhythms in his motets, which had been popular in medieval music. He used a way of harmonizing chants which became known as fauxbourdon. He was popular because he was skilled at writing melodies which were beautiful to sing."}

Today it is a small town compared to nearby Berlin, but once it was the start of the countries of Brandenburg and Prussia.\nHistory.\nBrandenburg was only on western bank of the Havel until 1196. But even after that year the parts on either side of the river were regarded as two different towns (Old and New Brandenburg) for centuries.\nIn 1314 the two towns joined the Hanseatic League. In the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) the towns were robbed and destroyed. Potsdam became the new capital, and the Royal Court left the town of Brandenburg. In 1715 the two halves of the town were merged to form a single town.\nThe concentration camp Brandenburg-G\u00f6rden was in G\u00f6rden, a suburb of Brandenburg, during the years of Nazi Germany.\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall the population dropped from over 100,000 in 1989 down to roughly 75,000 in 2005 through emigration.

In English they are often called Gypsies. Some Roma consider \"gypsy\" a slur, some not. The old word Chingar is rarely in use. The Roma are people that originally came from the Indian subcontinent at the 1st - 2st century AD, and settled in Egypt. \nA DNA study by Indian and Estonian researchers shows that the Ancestor of the Roma people originate from the Chingar tribe of Northwest india of the Chandala (untouchable), Dalit community of their ancestral homeland. They migrated as Traders via Roman Empire Egypt, through Asia Minor and finally to Europe. Today there are populations of Roma found all over Europe, although the largest populations are in Eastern Europe, in the Balkans, and their religions are: Eastern Christianity, Catholicism and Islam. Baptism by the Christian Roma (Dasikane) and Male Circumcision by the Muslim Roma (Horahane) are practiced. Their ancient religion was Hinduism and Buddhism. The majority of Romani people practise Endogamy Arranged marriage, only few Exogamy marriages are used. To marry a Gadjo (non Roma) is very seldom. Cousin marriage are prohibited.\nThere are various groups of Roma: the Roma of East European birth; the Sinti in Germany and Manouches in France and Catalonia; the Kal\u00f3 in Spain, Ciganos in Portugal and Gitans of southern France; the Romanichals of Britain, and the Romanlar in Turkey.\nThe Romani language, is now an official language in many countries of Europe under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\nHistory.\nThe 18th-century idea about the Indian birth of the Roma is based on the likeness between Romani and languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent and is now supported by genetic evidence. The origins of the Roma were not known until 1763, when a theology student named Stefan Vali met Indian medical students. He noticed that they were physically similar to the Roma he saw in Hungary. He also noticed that they were using similar words.\nIt is believed to have been around the 1st - 2st century AD, that the Ancestor of the Roma, the Chingari tribe, left the Indian subcontinent as Traders with Indo-Roman trade, via Arabian Sea through Roman Empire Egypt where they live for centuries and intermarried with Copt. The Copt named them \u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c81 (\"man or human\", also \"these people there\") in Coptic language. Around the 15th century, the Roma reached the Balkans. From there, they dispersed through Europe. The first arrivals were well accepted. European people thought they were Christian pilgrims. The local people of Europe were fascinated by their nomadic way of life and their new sciences. The Roma were often recruited as Musician, horse trainers and circus artists. Roma were crossing Europe aboard large caravans which contained their luggage.\nDuring World War II, Roma people suffered from the Nazis' persecution and ethnic cleansing policies. Statistics show that about 500,000 Roms died in Nazi concentration camps.\nAncestors.\nThe early Ancestors of the Romani people was the nomadic Chingari Tribe, who belongend to the untouchably Chandala Group from Central India, who wandered as nomads to north-west india. \nThe Children born of low caste Shudra Men and high caste Brahmin womans were called Chandala and are untouchables as per Manusmriti, an ancient legal constitution text of Hinduism. \nCulture.\nThe Roma left a musical heritage. Guitars and violins are part of their traditions. They influenced musical styles in Europe, such as Belly dance, flamenco, rumba, jazz, etc. \nOn 8 April 1971, the Roma nationality was legally recognized in Europe. Since this day, 8 April is the Roma national day.\nBelief.\nWhen the Yugoslav Wars was over at 2001, a small group of Christian and Muslim Balkans Roma, made there own Romani Folk Religion called Devlaism or in Romani language \"Devleske D\u012bn\", created from own Roma people Mythology &amp; Folklore of Oral tradition, rites like male Circumcision and infant Baptism is practised too. They believe Devla is the universal God. Devla is the name of God in romani language, derived from Deva. This New religious movement is hold very secretly. There is no holy Books, or spiritual leaders. To be a member, you must be a Roma or partial Roma itself. \nPersecutions.\nEven though they have been recognized, they still suffer from discrimination and Antiziganism. Some countries still apply discriminatory attitudes towards Roma, especially in workplaces and schools, where they are not accepted.Their squatting communities irritate locals. The Romani created an association in 1978 to defend their rights."}

She was an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. Only 116 people have ever been made honorary members. She was the wife of the conductor Sir John Barbirolli. She was born Evelyn Rothwell, and was always known by that name until after the death of her husband, John Barbirolli, when she changed her professional name to \u201cEvelyn Barbirolli\u201d. She became famous at a time when there were very few women in orchestras.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nEvelyn Rothwell\u2019s father was a tea dealer in the City of London. Her mother was related to Charles Reade, a 19th century novelist. She started to learn the oboe at her school, Downe House, near Newbury. Her father did not want her to study music, but in the end she was allowed to go to the Royal College of Music. She studied the oboe there, and the piano as a second instrument. She also played the cello and timpani. She was a student there at the same time as Benjamin Britten, who sometimes asked her to play some of the oboe music he had just written.\nEvelyn started her professional career as an oboist in the Drury Lane orchestra. She soon got a job with the Royal Opera House touring company whose conductor was John Barbirolli. Barbirolli was married, but his marriage did not last long.\nBarbirolli was then made conductor of the Scottish Orchestra (now called the Royal Scottish National Orchestra). He gave Evelyn the job of first oboe in this orchestra. He made an arrangement of a concerto by Handel for her to play. She played several other concertos with him conducting, and they made several recordings. Vaughan Williams was very pleased with their recording of his oboe concerto. Several composers wrote music especially for her. Henry Wood made her first oboist in the New Queen\u2019s Hall Orchestra. \nYears of marriage.\nEvelyn married Barbirolli in 1939, after he had divorced his first wife. By this time Barbirolli was conductor of the New York Philharmonic. He had taken this job after Toscanini had left. Barbirolli and his new wife lived in New York until 1943 when they returned to England so that Barbirolli could be the conductor of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester. Sometimes she played in the orchestra, but not very often because she thought people might say that it was because her husband was the conductor. When the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra went to Austria in 1948 she played Mozart\u2019s oboe concerto with them. People at that time only knew this work in an arrangement for the flute.\nIn Manchester Evelyn helped her husband by being his secretary. She drove him everywhere, and was always by his side at rehearsals to help him. As Barbirolli gradually became ill she spent nearly all her time with him instead of playing the oboe. She travelled with him to America when he became conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Barbirolli kept working hard although he was not well. During his last years they had financial problems when Barbirolli\u2019s manager caused them to lose a lot of money.\nAfter Barbirolli\u2019s death.\nAfter Barbirolli\u2019s death in 1970 she started to play her oboe again. She taught at the Royal Academy of Music, and was always known as \u201cLady Barbirolli\u201d (or \u201cLady B\u201d). She often adjudicated at music competitions. Her pupils respected her for her honesty and kindness. She wrote a book about \"Oboe Technique\" and the \"Oboist\u2019s Companion\", a book in 3 volumes. She also wrote an autobiography called \"Living with Glorious John\". She was made an OBE in 1984. She died the day after her 97th birthday."}

Currently, five states are divided into 22 \"Regierungsbezirke\", ranging in population from 5,255,000 (D\u00fcsseldorf) to 1,065,000 (Gie\u00dfen):\nHistory.\nThe first \"Regierungsbezirke\" were created by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1808/16, which divided its provinces into 25 \"Regierungsbezirke\". The \"Regierungsbezirke\" of North Rhine-Westphalia are in direct continuation of those created in 1815. Other states of the German Empire created similar entities, named \"Kreishauptmannschaft\" (in Saxony) or \"Kreis\" (in Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg) (not to be confused with the \"Kreis\" or \"Landkreis\" today). During the Third Reich, the Nazi government unified the naming; since then all these entities are called \"Regierungsbezirk\".\nOn January 1 2000 Rhineland-Palatinate disbanded its three \"Regierungsbezirke\" Koblenz, Rheinhessen-Pfalz and Trier - the employees and assets of the three \"Bezirksregierungen\" were converted into three public authorities responsible for the whole state, each covering a part of the former responsibilities of the \"Bezirksregierung\".\nOn January 1, 2004, Saxony-Anhalt disbanded its three \"Regierungsbezirke\": Dessau, Halle and Magdeburg. The responsibilities are now covered by a \"Landesverwaltungsamt\" with three offices at the former seats of the \"Bezirksregierungen\". \nOn January 1, 2005, Lower Saxony disbanded its four \"Regierungsbezirke\": Braunschweig, Hanover, L\u00fcneburg, and Weser-Ems.\nIn 2005, North Rhine-Westphalia planned to abolish its five \"Regierungsbezirke\" and create three self-government entities. The old, \"Prussian-style\", Regierungsbezirk had no self-government organs."}

He was a leading figure in the German Green Party and according to opinion polls , he was the most popular politician in Germany for most of the government's duration. He left office on 22 November 2005.\nEarly life.\nFischer was born in Gerabronn in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. His parents were Germans from Hungary. His nickname Joschka is from \"J\u00f3ska\", which is the Hungarian nickname for Joseph (). Fischer dropped out of high school in 1965, and started working for a photographer which he quit in 1966.\nIn 1967 he became active in the German student movement and Left-wing politics. Working in a left-wing bookstore in Frankfurt was when he started going to leftist university events as a guest student. He studied the works of Marx, Mao and Hegel and became a member of the militant group \"Revolutionary Combat\" ().\nFischer took part in some street battles when the anarchist \"Putzgruppe\" attacked the police and hurt some officers a lot. (In German the word \"Putz\" can mean a cleaner, but in \"Putz-group\" it is an acronym. That means the letters stand for other words. \"Proletarische Union f\u00fcr Terror und Zerst\u00f6rung\", i.e. \"The Workers Union for Terror and Destruction\"). Photos of one battle in March 1973 show Fischer clubbing policeman Rainer Marx . getting a workout (photo)\nIn the German Autumn () of 1977, there were a lot of terrorist attacks by the Red Army Faction (RAF). Fischer says that these attacks, especially the kidnapping and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, made him give up violence as a way to get political change.\nInstead, he became involved in the new social movements and later in the newly founded German Green Party, mainly in the state of Hesse.\nIn May 1981 the Minister of Economics of the state of Hesse, Heinz-Herbert Karry, was murdered. The gun that killed the minister was stolen from an American army base in 1973, and Fischer's car was used in the robbery.\nAs Foreign Minister, Fischer apologised for the violence of his \"Putzgruppe\" days,\nGreen politician.\nFrom 1983 to 1985, Fischer was a member of the Bundestag for the Green party. In 1985, he became Minister for the Environment in Hesse in the first Social Democrat-Green coalition (1985-1987). Fischer caused a stir when he arrived to take his oath of office ceremony wearing trainers. These trainers are now on display in a museum in Bonn.\nFischer was again Environment Minister in Hessen from 1991 to 1994, and, later on, became co-chairman of the Greens parliamentary party in the Bundestag. During his years in opposition, Fischer was respected for his speeches. For a large part of the 1990s, with the SPD was not very popular, and Fischers friends often called him \"real\" Leader of the Opposition.\nForeign Minister.\nIn September 1998 the Social Democrats, led by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, beat the Christian Democrat government of Helmut Kohl. With the SPD's 42% and the Greens' 7%, a coalition government could be formed. After several weeks of talks between Social Democrats and Greens, the new government took power on 27 October 1998. Fischer became Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nIn 1999 Fischer supported German participation in the Kosovo War. This was very extremely controversial within the largely pacifist Green Party, because it meant that, for the first time since World War II, German soldiers would actively go into combat. He justified this war with allegations that Serbia was planning to commit genocide against the Kosovo Albanians.\nFischer was also in favour of stationing German troops in Afghanistan, but he advised Schr\u00f6der not to join the war in Iraq. He is known as a good friend of Kofi Annan. By 2005 he was the second longest-serving foreign minister in German postwar history (after Hans-Dietrich Genscher).\nIn 2005 Fischer was accused by critics of carelessly relaxing controls on visa regulations for Ukraine, thus allowing many illegal immigrants to enter Germany with fake identities. A parliamentary committee was established to examine the case, and unlike in other such committee hearings, Fischer's statement (and that of other top officials) was shown live on public TV. Fischer's appearance before the committee took twelve hours. (See German Visa Affair 2005).\nAfter the defeat of the coalition government in the 2005 election, Fischer announced that he would retire to the backbench. \"After 20 years of power, now I want my freedom back\", he was quoted as saying. On 13 October 2005, it was announced that Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) would succeed Fischer as Foreign Minister.\nLife after politics.\nSince the beginning of September 2006 Joschka Fischer has been a senior fellow at the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination at Princeton University, a visiting professor at Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. He has also spoken at other American universities, notably Brandeis University, on various topic in foreign affairs and international relations.\nPrivate life.\nFischer has often been the most popular German politician, even among supporters of other parties.\nUntil 1996, Fischer had been an outspoken lover of good wines and food. He often bet cases of expensive wine with other politicians on the outcome of elections. Fischer had also been overweight. Within a short time he lose a lot of weight. Fischer said that this was due to his giving up alcohol completely and changing his diet. He had also been doing fitness training and even running marathons. He cashed in on his weight loss by writing the book \"My long race towards myself\" about his experience, which became an immediate bestseller. Recently he has been putting on weight again.\nFischer has been married five times: his first four marriages, to Edeltraud Fischer (1967-1984), Inge Vogel (1984-1987), Claudia Bohm (1987-1999), and Nicola Leske (1999-2003), all ended in divorce. In October 2005 he married (in Rome) Minu Barati, who was his common-law wife for 2 years. With Inge, his second wife, he has two children: David and Lara. In April 2005 Fischer became a grandfather for the first time.\nFurther reading.\nThe following sources reflect the views of U.S. adversaries of Fischer and his policies, especially Germany's decision not to participate in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\nOther websites.\nFischer writes a monthly commentary series, \"The Rebel Realist\", for Project Syndicate, a non-profit association of newspapers around the world."}

Nevertheless, the parent body was almost for sure destroyed by the impact/s that made the family, and Flora is probably a gravitational aggregate of most of the pieces. 43 Ariadne makes up much of the remaining mass (about a further 9%, with the remaining family members being fairly small, below 30 km in diameter.\nUnrelated asteroids.\nBecause of the high background density of asteroids in this part of space, one might expect that a great number of asteroids unrelated to the collision that made the family would be present. However, few have been found. This is because unrelated asteroids are hard to distinguish from family members because the family is of the same spectral type (S) that dominates the closer main belt overall. The few unrelated asteroids that have been found are all small (Florczak \"et al.\" 1998, and also by inspection of the PDS asteroid taxonomy data set for non S-type members.)

Their newest release, \"Every Second Counts\" (2006), was the first Plain White T's album to reach the mainstream. When the album came out, one song, \"Hey There Delilah\", an acoustic love song, was played on many radio stations daily. Another famous song of theirs is \"Our Time Now\".\nBiography.\nFormation.\nThe singer of the band, Tom Higgenson, first wanted to be a drummer. He was in many bands during his High School. However, when Plain White T's were made, he decided to become a singer and a songwriter. Bassist, Ken Fletcher, and drummer, Dave Tirio, joined the band began performing in Downers Grove, Illinois.\nEarly Career, 1999- 2001.\nThey started out by playing other people's songs, but in the summer of 1999 the band was beginning to become known by record labels like Atlantic Recordings. In 2000 they released their first album, \"Come On Over\". They toured around Chicago to try and make the album sell more and to get more fans.\nStop 2001-2004.\nAt the end of 2001, Plain White T's left Atlantic Recordings and signed to Fearless Records. They began recording for their next album, called \"Stop\". They chose in Downers Grove, Illinois and Santa Barbara, California. The album took four months to record, being finished in April 2002. The album was shown around Plain White T's home town before being released finally on August 20th 2002, a whole twenty months after it was started.\nIn October, the band went on their first big tour. The tour in the band ending up stopping being friends, this was solved with new members, with Dave switching from drums to guitar, Steve being replaced by Tim Lopez, Ken being replaced by Mike Retondo and De'Mar Hamilton taking up drums.\nAll That We Needed 2004-2006.\nThe band went into the studio to record their next album, called \"All That We Needed\",in May 2004. After recording the album, they toured the US. During this tour, they released their first single, \"All That We Needed\". They then promoted the album internationally, gathering a growing fanbase, before heading back for the 2005 Take Action Tour.\nDuring the \"Take Action Tour '05\", Plain White T's recorded their first music video with a single which they hoped would be more famous than \"All That We Needed\" .\nEvery Second Counts era 2006-present.\nIn 2006 they signed to another new label, Hollywood Records, and then began recording a new album. Shortly before the release of the album, the single \"Hate (I Really Don't Like You)\" was released, it was the first single by them to achieve noticeable success.\nPlain White T's started touring in Winter and Autumn of 2006. By this time they were starting to get noticed in the music industry at last. Although they were beginning to get noticed in the minor US rock industry, internationally Plain White Ts were not doing so well, by this point, they had not even sold 100,000 copies of any album anywhere outside of the US. Hollywood Records thought that re-releasing \"Hey There Delilah\" would make the band famous.\nBreakthrough: \"Hey There Delilah\".\n\"Hey There Delilah\" is an acoustic song, first released as a single in May 2006 as chasing cars, and was the last track in the band's first album, All That We Needed. One year later, in 2007, the song became the band's first mainstream hit. On 11 July 2007, the song reached number one for sales in the Billboard Hot 100. One month later, the song became a hit single all over the world. \"Hey There Delilah\" reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and Ireland Singles Chart, number four in the Australian chart and number six in the United World Chart. Its popularity made it to #1 in other countries like Germany and Canada."}

{"id": "89937", "revid": "7733973", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89937", "title": "Suharto", "text": "Suharto (February 20, 1921 \u2013 January 27, 2008) was an Indonesian military and political leader. He was a military officer in the Indonesian Army. He is better known as the second President of Indonesia. He held the office for a long time, from 1967 to 1998.\nPolitical power.\nIn the early morning of October 1, 1965, a group of soldiers claiming to be supported by the Indonesian Communist Party killed six generals in the army and one assistant because they thought he was a seventh. Many friends and supporters of Suharto claimed they were members of the communist party itself. The people of Indonesia then started killing anybody they thought was communist with Suharto's tacit approvement. Estimates range around half a million. Suharto then seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia Sukarno. For this, he used some force, but also took some political maneuvers. At the time, there was instability and unrest inside and outside of Indonesia. This helped him come to power. He took three decades to change the regime to work along militarist lines, with a strong central government. His movement was known as \"Orde Baru\". As he took an anti-communist position which he could defend, several Western governments supported him both in economic and political matters. This was during an era that is known as Cold War. For most of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced significant economic growth and industrialization. His rule, however, led to political purges and the deaths of about half a million of suspected Indonesian communists; many of them Chinese-Indonesians. He also made some laws against communist parties and ethnic Chinese.\nHis New Order administration's authoritarian and increasingly corrupt practices led to much discontent in the 1990s. Suharto's almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians' standard of living. People inside the military and other institutions no longer supported him. There were some problems inside the country during the early 1990s. Suharto became more and more isolated, in a political way. After mass demonstrations in 1998, Suharto was forced to resign. Suharto had been the face of Indonesia for over 30 years. After retiring, he lived in seclusion. There were people who wanted to try him for genocide. This failed however, because he had a very bad health. His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and abroad.\nLike many Javanese, Suharto has only one name. In contexts where his religion is being discussed he is sometimes called Haji or el-Haj Mohammed Suharto, but this Islamic title is not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \"Suharto\" has been official in Indonesia since 1947 but the older spelling Soeharto is still frequently used.\nDeath.\nSuharto was admitted to hospital on January 4; on 23 January, Suharto's health worsened further, as a sepsis infection spread through his body. His family consented to the removal of life support machines if his condition did not improve and he died on 27 January at 1:09 pm. He died at Pertamina Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia of congestive heart failure. He was taken off life support. He was buried at\u00a0a family mausoleum near Solo town.\nSukarno, Suharto and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo/Slaughter of Indonesian \"Communists\".\nThe balance of power was shifted in favour of anti-Communists in December 1965, when personnel from both the Army Para-commando Regiment and 5th Brawijaya Military Region units arrived in Bali after having carried out killings in Java. Led by Suharto's principal troubleshooter, Sarwo Edhie Wibowo who with Javanese military commanders permitted Balinese squads (led by Anwar Congo, Adi Zulkadry, Safit Pardede) to kill until reined in. In contrast to Central Java where the Army encouraged people to kill the \"Gestapu\", Bali's eagerness to kill was so tremendous and spontaneous that, having provided logistic support initially, the Army eventually had to step in to prevent chaos. Sukarno's choice of Bali's provincial governor, Suteja, was recalled from office and accused of preparing a communist uprising, and his relatives were tracked down and killed. A series of killings similar to those in Central and East Java were led by black-shirted PNI youth. For several months, militia death squads went through villages capturing suspects and taking them away. Hundreds of houses belonging to communists and their relatives were burnt down within one week of the reprisal crusade, with occupants being butchered as they ran from their homes. An early estimate suggested that 50,000 people, including women and children, were killed in this operation alone. The population of several Balinese villages were halved in the last months of 1965. All the Chinese shops in the towns of Singaraja and Denpasar were destroyed and many of their owners who were alleged to have financially supported the \"Gestapu\" killed. Between December 1965 and early 1966, an estimated 80,000 Balinese were killed, roughly 5% of the island's population at the time, and proportionally more than anywhere else in Indonesia. Most of the people killed had little to do with Communist Party or other allegations thrown at them.\nSukarno continued to command loyalty from large sections of the armed forces as well as the general population, and Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.\nIn January 1966, university students under the banner of KAMI, begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection from the army. Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.\nIn February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full general in July 1966). The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace (60\u00a0km away) by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals, Major-General Basuki Rahmat, Brigadier-General M Jusuf, and Brigadier-General Amirmachmud went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see \"Supersemar\") that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.\nUsing the \"Supersemar\" letter, Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint a new cabinet consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the MPRS (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each service.\nIn June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of Marxism\u2013Leninism, ratifying the Supersemar, and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year). Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among some elements of the armed forces.\nBy January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in near seclusion in June 1970."}

Industrialisation changes the things people do. Industrialisation caused towns to grow larger. Many people left farming to take higher paid jobs in factories in towns.\nIndustrialisation is part of a process where people adopt easier and cheaper ways to make things. Using better technology, it becomes possible to produce more goods in a shorter amount of time. More things can be produced by fewer people. \nAfter industrialisation people also do more specialised jobs. For example before industrialisation, a cobbler made the whole shoe. He worked on one pair of shoes, finished that, and then did the next pair of shoes. Industrial shoemaking involves many people in making shoes in a factory. An individual worker has a smaller task, however. One person cuts the sole of the shoe. Another person stitches it on. In short there is division of labour. They make even more shoes when they use cutting machines, sewing machines and other special machines. The factory may be owned by a rich person who can afford the machines, or by a company.\nIndustrialisation started in England with the industrial revolution in the 18th century. It spread first to parts of Europe, and to North America. In the 20th century industrialisation spread to most other countries."}

His parents were from a very strict Christian sect called the Plymouth Brethren - and they believed that what ever they did in life, they would go to heaven anyway. He had one brother, William, born in 1903. His father died in 1914 and Adams was brought up by his mother. The family moved to Belfast but in 1918 William died from flu. Adams studied medicine at university.\nJob.\nAdams worked for one year in a hospital in Bristol. He then moved to Eastbourne, England where he became a general practitioner. He cared for a lot of old female patients and many of them were very rich. 132 left him money or gifts when they died. Rumours started that Adams was killing them with heroin and morphine and the police decided to investigate. Many of the possible victims had been cremated (burnt), so there were few bodies for the police to analyse.\nTrial.\nAdams was arrested and tried for the murder of one patient in 1957, but found not guilty. Another charge was withdrawn - an event the judge later criticised. The trial was reported in newspapers around the world and was described at the time as \"one of the greatest murder trials of all time\".\nClaims of unfairness.\nSome have claimed that the trial was not held fairly. Police files show that the prosecution gave secret records to the defence to help them defend Adams. Evidence (some notebooks written by the patient's nurses) was lost by the prosecution and then found later by the defence. When it was produced during the trial, the prosecution pretended that it had never seen it. Also, the case that was chosen (Mrs Morrell) was probably one of the least likely to succeed.\nOne historian claims that the government did not want Adams to be convicted, because he would then have been hanged. If this had happened, many doctors would have refused to treat government (NHS) patients and the government would have become very unpopular.\nOther crimes.\nAdams was later found guilty of 13 other crimes - prescription fraud, lying on cremation forms, obstructing a police search and failing to keep a register of the dangerous drugs he used.\nHe had his license to be a doctor taken away in 1957 but it was given back in 1961. He was banned for life from prescribing dangerous drugs.\nScotland Yard's files on the case were meant to be secret until 2033, but special permission was given in 2003 to open them.\nOpinions.\nEven though he was found not guilty, most experts now consider him to have been a serial killer. The judge in his trial later wrote a book in which he said Adams was probably guilty. The police thought that Adams killed 163 of his patients."}

He then got a Ph.D in clinical psychology in 1979 at the University of North Texas. At the University of North Texas, his dissertation was titled \"Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention.\"\nCareer.\nAfter obtaining his Ph.D., McGraw joined his father, Dr. Joe McGraw, in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the elder McGraw had a private psychology practice.\nIn 1983, McGraw and his father joined Thelma Box, a successful Texas businesswoman, in presenting \"Pathways\" seminars, \"an experience-based training which allows individuals to achieve and create their own results.\"\nIn 1990, McGraw joined lawyer Gary Dobbs in co-founding Courtroom Sciences Inc. (CSI), a trial consulting firm through which McGraw later came into contact with Oprah Winfrey. After some time, CSI became a profitable enterprise. It advising Fortune 500 companies and injured plaintiffs about achieving settlements. McGraw is no longer an officer or director of the company. After starting CSI, McGraw ceased the practice of psychology.\nOprah Winfrey and the \"Dr. Phil\" show.\nIn 1995, Oprah Winfrey hired McGraw's legal consulting firm CSI to prepare her for the Amarillo Texas beef trial. Winfrey was so impressed with McGraw that she thanked him for her victory in that case, which ended in 1998. Soon after, she invited him to appear on her show. His appearance proved so successful that he began appearing weekly as a \"Relationship and Life Strategy Expert\" on Tuesdays starting in April 1998.\nThe next year, McGraw published his first best-selling book, \"Life Strategies\", some of which was taken from the \"Pathways\" seminar. In the next four years, McGraw published three additional best-selling relationship books, along with workbooks to complement them.\nAs of September 2002, McGraw formed Peteski Productions and launched his own syndicated daily television show, \"Dr. Phil\", produced by Winfrey's Harpo Studios. The format is an advice show, where he tackles a different topic on each show, offering advice for his guests' troubles.\nWeight loss products.\nIn 2003 Dr Phil started selling weight loss products. They were called, \"Shape It Up, Woo, Woo!\" McGraw said science showed they could help users control their weight. Many people criticized this and the Federal Trade Commission investigated. McGraw stopped selling weight loss products in March 2004 In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products said they would file a class action lawsuit against him because although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not cause weight loss. McGraw paid $10.5 million in September 2006 to stop the lawsuit."}

Savonarola is famous for burning books, and for the destruction of what he considered immoral art. Savonarola was a priest but he preached against the moral corruption of the clergy and the Church of Rome. His main enemy was Pope Alexander VI. He is sometimes seen as a forerunner of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, however he remained a devout Roman Catholic.\nIn the twentieth century, a movement for the canonization of \"Fr\u00e0 Savonarola\" began to develop within the Roman Catholic Church, particularly among Dominicans. Many believe that his excommunication and execution were not legal. However, his beatification and canonization is opposed by many Jesuits, who think Savonarola's attacks on the papacy to have been a serious crime.\nEarly years.\nSavonarola was born in Ferrara, which was the capital of the independent Duchy of Ferrara.\nIn his youth he studied the Bible, and then went to the University of Ferrara. He wrote two poems which showed his anger at morally corrupt clergymen. The first, about the end of the world, was written when he was only 20. Savonarola wrote the second poem \"De Ruina Mundi\" (\"On the Downfall of the World\") in 1475. In this poem he said the Roman Curia was \"a false, proud whore\".\nFlorence.\nSavonarola became a Dominican friar in 1475, and entered the convent of San Domenico in Bologna. He studied theology. In 1479 he went to the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli. In 1482 the Dominicans sent him to Florence, the \u2018city of his destiny\u2019. After five years, he went back to Bologna where he became 'master of studies\u2019.\nHe returned to Florence in 1490 and began to preach about the end of the world. He had visions and prophecies which he said had come to him from God and the saints. Several disasters made his prophecies real. He spoke about the failing power of the ruling Medici family. Savonarola never tried to make war on the Roman Curia. He wanted to put an end to the sins of the popes who cared more about their riches and power than they did about God .\nAfter Charles VIII of France invaded Florence in 1494, the ruling Medici were removed. Savonarola became the new leader of the city, both as a secular leader and priest. He set up a rather modern democratic republic in Florence. Savonarola wanted to make Florence a city devoted to God, a good \u201cChristian and religious Republic.\u201d Homosexuality had been acceptable in Florence, and many were important people. One of Savonarola's first laws was to make sodomy a crime which would be punished by death.\nIn 1497, he and his followers went to the Piazza della Signoria, and began to burn mirrors, cosmetics, obscene pictures, pagan books, gaming tables, musical instruments, fine dresses, women\u2019s hats, and the works of immoral and ancient poets. They also burnt paintings by some famous artists, such as Sandro Botticelli and Michelangelo. This event is now called the \"Bonfire of the Vanities\".\nThe Fall.\nFlorence soon became tired of Savonarola. The city had become an unhappy place to live. Savonarola's promises that God would change things in the city did not come true, and his predictions of the end of the world did not happen. During his Ascension Day sermon on May 4, 1497, groups of young men rioted in the streets, people began singing and dancing, and the taverns reopened. The riot became a revolution.\nExcommunication and execution.\nOn May 13, 1497, Savonarola was excommunicated by Pope Alexander VI. In 1498, Alexander demanded his arrest and execution. On April 8, soldiers attacked the Convent of San Marco and after a bloody battle Savonarola's guards and religious supporters were killed. He surrendered and during the next few weeks was tortured to make him say that he was gulity of heresy, corruption, and other crimes against the Church.\nOn the day of his execution he was taken out to the Piazza della Signoria with Fra Silvestro and Fra Domenico da Pescia, two religious friends of Savonarola. They were stripped of their clerical clothing, and called heretics and schismatics. The three men were put on crosses,and burned alive. Savonarola died in the same place where he had burnt the paintings and books.\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, author of \"The Prince\", also saw and wrote about the execution. The Medici soon retook control of Florence."}

The name comes from Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environmental RESearch project. There is also a star called Antares.\nFunctions.\nIt uses 900 light sensors attached to 12 strings that float in the sea to detect neutrinos. The strings are held onto the sea floor by an anchor and straight up by a buoy floating in the sea. Although the neutrinos are invisible, they can create a different particle, a muon, in water. The muon then gives off light by the Cherenkov effect because it travels faster than light in water. \nThe sensors are so sensitive that they need only very little light and can even detect single photons. This is necessary because the muons produce only very little light.\nLocation.\nThe detector is located in the Mediterranean, about 40 kilometres off Toulon in southern France. There the sea is 2500 metres deep. It is built by a group of physicists from 12 European countries. Currently, 10 strings are running. The last two strings will be installed in May 2008.\nTrivia.\nIt is the largest neutrino detector in the Northern hemisphere.

However, when light travels in a transparent medium (such as water or glass), it moves more slowly than it would in a vacuum. This means that particles can actually move faster than the speed of light in certain mediums. When a particle with an electric charge moves faster than light in a medium which can be polarized, it causes the medium to send out photons (light particles) and thereby loses energy. The photons that are sent out can be measured, as they are simple light.\nExplanation.\nThe formation of Cherenkov radiation is analogous\u00a0to the\u00a0bow wave\u00a0caused by a power boat traveling faster than the speed of water waves or to the\u00a0shock wave\u00a0(sonic boom) produced by an airplane traveling faster than the\u00a0speed of sound\u00a0in air.\nWhen an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of\u00a0pressure waves\u00a0in front of the aircraft and behind it. These waves travel at the\u00a0speed of sound\u00a0and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves get compressed as they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. When the aircraft gets the velocity of sound wave, the pressure waves get merge into a single shock wave. As the velocity keeps increasing, the single shock wave extends mostly to the rear and extends from the craft in a restricted widening cone. We hear this as sonic boom. Similarly, a bow wave forms when something moves\u00a0through a fluid at a speed greater than the speed of a wave moving across the fluid. The mechanism of Cherenkov radiation is same but it occurs for light waves.\nWhen a charged particle moves inside a polarizable medium, it excites some the ellectrons of that medium. As the excited ellectrons return to their ground state, they emits electromagnetic radiation. According to the Huygens principle, the emitted waves move out spherically at the phase velocity of that medium. If the particle moves faster than the speed of light in that medium, the emitted waves add up and at an angle with respect to the particle direction a radiation is emitted which is known as Cherenkov radiation.\nBecause nothing can move faster than light\u00a0in a\u00a0vacuum, there is no Cherenkov light in a vacuum. However, if we say that light in water moves only with 75% of its speed in vacuum, particles with very high energy are now able to move faster than light (through water) and create Cherenkov light.\nThe reason Cherenkov light often appears blue is because its effect is proportional to the frequency, in that the higher the frequency, the higher the effect of the radiation. Because higher frequency light equates to shorter\u00a0wavelengths, and blue light has one of the shortest wavelengths of visible light, Cherenkov light is usually blue.\nEmission angle with respect to the first image.\nIn the first image, a charged particle (red) moves at a speed of formula_1 where \nRatio between the speed of the particle and the speed of light is\nIn this medium, the velocity of light is (n is the refractive index)\nLeft side of this image is the initial point (\"t\" = 0) and the right side is the location of the particle after \"t\" time\u0964 \nSo, the distance passed by the particle in \"t\" time is\nAnd the distance passed by the light is\nSo, the emission angle is (using trigonometry)\nWe can also derive the emission angle from the second image too."}

Many Chinese Buddhists believe he was a reincarnation of Maitreya, the person who will become the next Buddha after Gautama Buddha.\nHe has become incorporated into Buddhist, Taoist and Shinto. Images of him can be found in many temples, restaurants, and businesses. Budai has become a god of happiness and plenty in some forms of Taoism and Buddhism. In Japan, Hotei is one of the Seven Lucky Gods (\"Shichi Fukujin\"). He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the \"Laughing Buddha\" (Chinese:\u7b11\u4f5b).\nHistory.\nAs Angida Arhat.\nBudai may be based on a monk that lived in the time of Sakyamuni Buddha. This monk's name was \"Angida\", whose name means \"calico bag\". According to legend, Angida was an Indian snake catcher who caught poisonous snakes to stop them from biting people. Budai and Angida look similar because they are both depicted as plump, laughing and carrying a bag.\nAs a Chinese Buddhist monk.\nIn the Chinese tradition, Budai was a monk who lived in China around 907 to 923 CE. He was a man who was good and loving. Apart from his character, his likeness with the Maitreya Bodhisattva (the future Buddha) come from a Buddhist hymn (Chinese: \u5048\u8bed; Pinyin: Ji\u00e9y\u01d4) which he said before his death:\nDescription.\nBudai is almost always shown carrying a sack, which never empties, and is filled with many precious things, including rice plants (symbolizing wealth), sweets for children, food, and the sadness of the world. His duty is to protect the weak, the poor and children.\nIn Chinese Buddhist temples, Budai's statue is put in the front part of the entrance hall. He is shown as a stout, smiling or laughing man in robes with a largely bare belly, which represents happiness, good luck, and plenty.\nSome statues show small children at his feet. Another item that is usually seen in Budai statues, is a begging bowl, which shows that he is a Buddhist. All of these images show Budai as a wandering monk who goes around and takes sadness from people. Because he represents richness and happiness, statues are often found in homes and businesses in China and Japan.\nCh\u00e1n Buddhism.\nThe main story that concerns Budai in Chan is a short koan.\nPhra Sangkadchai/ Phra Sangkachai.\nIn Thailand Budai is sometimes confused with another monk that is respected in Thailand. Phra Sangkadchai or Shanghai (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e08\u0e08\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e4c), a Thai spelling of Mahakaccayanathera (Thai: \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e31\u0e08\u0e08\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e40\u0e16\u0e23\u0e30), was a Buddhist monk in the time of the Buddha. The Buddha praised \"Phra Sangkadchai\" for his excellence in explaining complicated dharma (or dhamma) in an easily understandable way.\n Although both Budai and Phra Sangkadchai may be found in both Thai and Chinese temples, Phra Sangkadchai is found more often in Thai temples, and Budai in Chinese temples. Two points to distinguish them from one another are:\n1. Phra Sangkadchai has a bit of hair on his head while Budai is bald.2. Phra Sangkadchai wears the robes in Theravadin Buddhist fashion with the robes folded across one shoulder, leaving the other uncovered. Budai wears the robes in Chinese style, covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered.\nFolklore.\nOne belief surrounding the figure of Budai in popular folklore is that if a person rubs his belly, it brings wealth, good luck, and prosperity. This belief however is not part of any Buddhist ritual, but is a part of a Chinese folk belief. He is often admired for his happiness, abundance, wisdom, and contentment."}

His name is spelt in various ways: \u201cBinchoys\u201d, \u201cBinch\u201d or \u201cBinche\u201d or \u201cGilles de Bins\u201d. He is one of the earliest composers of the group known as the Burgundian School. His style of composition had a very important influence on music at the Burgundian court. Together with Guillaume Dufay and John Dunstaple he belongs to the greatest of 15th century composers.\nLife.\nHe was probably born in Mons in what is now Belgium. His father, a councillor to Duke Guillaume IV of Hainault, had a job in a church in Mons. Nothing is known about Gilles until 1419, when he became organist at the church of Ste. Waudru in Mons. In 1423 went to live in Lille. He may have worked as a soldier.\nSometime near the end of the 1420s he joined the court chapel of Burgundy. He sang with the choir there. He spent many years working at the Burgundian court. He was not allowed much time to be away, so he did not travel much. We know that he went to Mons in 1449 on which occasion he met Guillaume Dufay. When he retired he went to live in Soignes. He had a good pension.\nMusic and influence.\nBinchois wrote beautiful melodies which were much simpler than a lot of the music of the Middle Ages. They are easy to sing and remember. Many later composers used melodies by Binchois as a basis for their own masses. Most of his secular songs are rondeaux, which became the most common song form during the century. Binchois did not often write in strophic form. He preferred to write music which did not follow the rhyming rhythm of the verse."}

He was one of the most famous composers in the early 15th century. He had a lot of influence on music in England as well as on the continent. He helped to develop the style of the Burgundian School.\nThe spelling \"Dunstaple\" is more often used today because in documents from his time this is the spelling that is more common, although some documents spelt his name \"Dunstable\".\nLife.\nDunstaple was probably born in Dunstable, Bedfordshire around 1390. We know very little about his life. He was well educated and he worked for the Duke of Bedford who was the fourth son of Henry IV and brother of Henry V. He may have spent some time in France because the duke was Regent of France from 1423 to 1429, and then Governor of Normandy from 1429 to his death in 1435. Dunstaple owned property in Normandy, and also in Cambridgeshire, Essex and London, according to tax records of 1436. He also worked for the Duke of Gloucester.\nMany composers at that time were priests, but Dunstaple was not, although he had connections with St Albans Abbey. He was probably married.\nDuring his life he was not just known as a composer but also as an astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician.\nHe died on Christmas Eve 1453, and was buried in the church of St Stephen Walbrook in London which was later destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. \nMusic and influence.\nWe hardly have any original manuscripts of Dunstaple\u2019s music. England was a very musical country at the time, but almost all that music was destroyed between 1536 and 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries when Henry VIII was ruling. Most of Dunstaple\u2019s works which survive were works which were found on the continent, mostly in north Italy. This shows that he must have been famous throughout Europe. He influenced Dufay and Binchois. The Flemish composer and music theorist Tinctoris wrote in 1476 that he was the most important musician of new music which had started in England.\nDunstaple was one of the first to compose masses using one melody as \"cantus firmus.\" He wrote many carols (religious songs), but we do not know which ones are by him because he did not sign his name to them. He wrote secular music, but it has been lost."}

It was also the first war to use a telegraph to give information to a newspaper quickly.\nBackground.\nThe Ottoman Empire was declining by the mid-1800s. The war started after the Ottoman Empire decided that France, not Russia, had the right to protect Christians in the Holy Land near the area of modern-day Israel. \nRussia sent an army to take part of Ottoman Romania and so the British and the French allies sent an army and a navy to stop that. When the allies got to their camp in Gallipoli, Russia retreated and so the allies decided instead to take back Crimea, where Russia had its naval base. Russia had taken Crimea from the Ottoman Empire in an earlier war.\nResults.\nThe Allies won the war in Crimea but gave it back to Russia in return for Russia giving back other places and promising not to have a navy on the Black Sea. \nThe Crimean War was a very important point in the history of warfare. The weapons that were used were novel, and it was also the first war reported by the press via photography and journalists.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo, both countries sitting along the river's banks, are named after it. From 1971 to 1997, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was called Zaire and its government called the river the Zaire River.\nThe sources of the Congo are in the Highlands and mountains of the East African Rift, as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru, which feed the Lualaba River. This then becomes the Congo below Boyoma Falls. The Chambeshi River in Zambia is usually taken as the source of the Congo because of the accepted practice worldwide of using the longest tributary, as with the Nile River.\nThe Congo flows mostly west from Kisangani just below the falls, then slowly bends southwest, passing by Mbandaka, joining with the Ubangi River, and running into the Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa (formerly L\u00e9opoldville) and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool, where the river narrows and falls through a few cataracts in deep canyons (collectively known as the Livingstone Falls), running by Matadi and Boma, and into the sea at the small town of Muanda.\nHistory of exploration.\nThe mouth of the Congo was visited by Europeans in 1482, by the Portuguese Diogo C\u00e3o, and in 1817, by a British exploration under James Kingston Tuckey that went up the river as far as Isangila. Henry Morton Stanley was the first European to travel along the whole river.\nEconomic importance.\nAlthough the Livingstone Falls stop ships coming in from the sea, almost all of the Congo is navigable in parts, especially between Kinshasa and Kisangani. Railways cross the three major falls that interrupt navigation, and much of the trade of central Africa passes along the river. Goods include copper, palm oil, sugar, coffee, and cotton. The river can also be valuable for hydroelectric power, and Inga Dams below Pool Malebo have been built.\nIn February of 2005, South Africa's state owned power company, Eskom, said that they had a proposal to increase the amount of electric power that the Inga can make through improvements and the building of a new hydroelectric dam. The project would bring the highest output of the dam to 40 GW, twice that of China's Three Gorges Dam.\nGeological history.\nIn the Mesozoic period before the continental drift opened the South Atlantic Ocean, the Congo was the upper part of a river about 12,000 km (7,500 miles) long that flowed west across the parts of Gondwanaland, now called Africa and South America.\nTributaries.\nListed from down a river, to up a river:\nLiterature.\nThe Congo River was the location the novel \"Heart of Darkness\" by Joseph Conrad."}

It is not the tallest structure of any kind in the Americas either, as the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, also in the United States, is taller at , but that needs wires to keep it upright.\nConstruction of the concrete tower started on February 6, 1973. In 1975, while it was still being built, it became taller than the Ostankino Tower in Moscow. When it opened to the public on June 26, 1976, it became the tallest free-standing structure on land in the world. It held this record for more than thirty years, until the Burj Khalifa, while it was still being built, became taller on September 12, 2007 . The CN Tower continued to be the world's tallest tower until the Canton Tower became taller in 2010. It is now the ninth tallest building in the world and the fifth tallest free-standing structure behind both of these, the Shanghai Tower, and the Burj Khalifa.\nThe \"CN\" in the tower's name came from the \"Canadian National\" Railway, the railway company that built the tower. In 1995, the railway sold the tower to the Canada Lands Company (CLC). Local residents wanted to keep the name \"CN Tower\", though, so the abbreviation is now a shortened form of Canada's National Tower instead of the original Canadian National Tower. Neither of these names are commonly used, though; the tower is usually called the CN Tower.\nToday, the CN Tower is an important icon of Toronto and has more than two million tourists and visitors every year.

In the 19th century the town played an important role as a meeting place for the nobles, rich and other important people. A rich cultural heritage from that time can still be found at Baden-Baden.\nHistory.\nThe springs of Baden-Baden were known to the Romans, and the foundation of the town is referred to the emperor Hadrian by an inscription of somewhat doubtful authenticity. The name of Aurelia Aquensis was given to it in honour of Aurelius Severus, in whose reign it would seem to have been well known. Fragments of its ancient sculptures are still to be seen, and in 1847 remains of Roman vapour baths, well preserved, were discovered just below the New Castle.\nIn 1931, the town of Baden-Baden was officially given its double name (a short form for \"Baden in Baden\", i.e. Baden in the state of Baden). In both World Wars, the town escaped destruction. After World War II, Baden-Baden became the headquarters of the French forces in Germany and the site of a displaced persons camp.\nFrom September 23 to September 28 1981, the XIth Olympic Congress took place in the \"Kurhaus\" in Baden-Baden.\nThe Baden Airpark is 15\u00a0km west of Baden-Baden.\nThe Russian writer Dostoevsky wrote \"The Gambler\" while gambling at the famous Baden-Baden Casino."}

Its 2005 population was 42,015. It joined with Bavaria by popular vote in 1920. Before 1918, it was the larger of the two capital cities in the united duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\nCoburg's Coat of Arms honoring the city's patron Saint Maurice was granted in 1493.\nHistory.\nCoburg is about 90\u00a0km south of Erfurt and about 100\u00a0km north of Nuremberg. Coburg was first mentioned in a document dated 1056, although there was a settlement at the site that before then called Trufalistat. Following several changes of noble owners, it came into the hands of the House of Wettin in 1353 when Friedrich III, the Strong, married Katherina von Henneberg. In 1596, it became the capital of one of the new Duchy of Saxe-Coburg under the leadership of Duke Johann Casimirs (ruled 1596-1633).\nDue to the royal connections among the royal houses of Europe, Coburg was the site of many royal Ducal weddings and visits. Britain's Queen Victoria made 6 visits to Coburg during her 64-year reign. In 1896 one ceremony brought together Queen Victoria, her son Edward (future Edward VII), her second son Alfred (Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), her daughter the German dowager Empress Friedrich (Victoria), and many of her grandchildren, such as Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and the future King George V of Great Britain.\nIn 1920, two years after the abdication of the last duke, the locals voted to join Bavaria. Thus whilst the other Saxon-Thuringian principalities were later incorporated into the German Democratic Republic after World War II, Coburg became part of West Germany As a result, the town spent the Cold War years lying right next to the Iron Curtain, surrounded by East German territory on three sides.\nMain sights.\nCoburg has the typical features of a former capital of German little states. There are numerous houses from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The most important landmarks include:\nReligion.\nMost residents of Coburg are members of the Evangelical Church (Lutheranism). Other Christian communities are Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, the ICF Movement, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Old Catholics and the New Apostolic Church, as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are also three communities of Muslims. Coburg had a large Jewish community until the 1940s. Jews have lived there since the 14th century. The old synagogue was a former church. Today it is used by Old Catholics. Coburg became Protestant after the Reformation. All Catholics were persecuted. A new Catholic community was founded in the 19th century.\nDistricts.\nCoburg is divided into 15 districts:\nOver two thirds of Coburg's population live in Coburg City.\nFamous people.\nAmongst the associated royalty, one individual's 20th century association with Coburg proved especially tragic. This was that of the British Royal Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who was arrested and tried as a Nazi.\nBesides various royalty, other famous individuals associated with Coburg include Hans Berger (graduated), William Frishmuth (born), and Eduard Study (born).\nIn 1530, Martin Luther stayed in the \"Veste Coburg\" to follow negotiations at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg. He also preached at St. Moriz church. \nIn 1887, Johann Strauss, the \"Waltz King\", left Vienna when the Roman Catholic Church would not let him divorce his 2nd wife. He moved to Lutheran Saxe-Coburg-Gotha with his future 3rd wife Adele, where he lived the last 13 years of his life in Coburg. He was however buried in Vienna.\nIn 1922, Adolf Hitler led several hundred stormtroopers in a march through the city, fighting pitched street battles with leftists. During the Nazi era, the Coburg Badge was one of the most prestigious party medals.\nHans Morgenthau, founder of International Relations as a field of study, was born here.\nThe US National Hot Dog and Sausage Council asserts that Frankfurt am Main is traditionally credited with originating the Frankfurter. According to the Council, this claim is disputed and that the hot dog was created in the late 1600s by Johann Georghehner, a butcher, living in Coburg. Coburg was the first German town to elect a Nazi Mayor."}

His prints were often in a series, so that there is a group of different prints about a subject. The most famous series are the \"Apocalypse\" (1498) and his two series on the passion of Christ, the \"Great Passion\" (1498\u20131510) and the \"Little Passion\" (1510\u20131511).\nD\u00fcrer's best known individual engravings (that is, ones that are not part of a series) include ' (1513), ' (1514) and \"Melencolia I\" (1514). His most iconic images are his woodcuts of the \"\" (1497\u20131498) from the \"Apocalypse\" series, the \"Rhinoceros\", and numerous self-portraits in oils. D\u00fcrer possibly did not cut his own woodblocks but may have employed a skilled carver who followed his drawings faithfully. He painted a number of religious works in oils and made many brilliant watercolours and drawings, which through modern reproductions are now perhaps his best known works.\nD\u00fcrer's prints made him famous across Europe before he was 30, and many people say he is the greatest artist of the Renaissance in Northern Europe.\nEarly life.\nD\u00fcrer was the third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children. His father was a successful goldsmith from Ajt\u00f3s, near Gyula in Hungary.\nD\u00fcrer's godfather was Anton Koberger, who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year D\u00fcrer was born. He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, and owned twenty-four printing presses and had many offices in Germany and abroad. His most famous publication was the \"Nuremberg Chronicle,\" published in 1493 in German and Latin. It had 1,809 woodcut pictures by the Wolgemut workshop. D\u00fcrer may well have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.\nD\u00fcrer had started to learn goldsmithing and drawing from his father. His father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, but he was so good at drawing that he started as an apprentice to Michael Wolgemut at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in silverpoint, is dated 1484 (Albertina, Vienna). Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, and had a large workshop making different types of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was a rich city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially Venice, a relatively short distance across the Alps.\nWanderjahre and marriage.\nAfter completing his term of apprenticeship in 1489, D\u00fcrer followed the common German custom of taking a \"wanderjahre\" \u2014 in effect a gap year. D\u00fcrer was away nearly four years, travelling through Germany, Switzerland, and probably, the Netherlands. D\u00fcrer wanted to meet Martin Schongauer, the best engraver of Northern Europe, but Schongauer died shortly before D\u00fcrer's arrival. He stayed at the house of Schongauer's brother, and got some pictures that Schongauer owned.\nHis first painted self-portrait is now in the Louvre. It was painted in Strasbourg, probably so that D\u00fcrer could send it back to his fianc\u00e9e in Nuremberg. In fact, very soon after he got back to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494 D\u00fcrer was married to Agnes Frey. She was the daughter of a well known brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. He was 23, and the marriage was arranged while D\u00fcrer was away travelling. his absence. They had no children, and most people think that they did not marry for love, but because it was good to link the two families. Also, a single man could not set up in business for himself in Nuremberg. D\u00fcrer painted some portraits of his wife, but experts say that they \"lack warmth\". The experts think that if D\u00fcrer loved his wife he would have taken more time over those pictures to make her look more beautiful and friendly.\nFirst Visit to Italy.\nWithin three months D\u00fcrer left for Italy. The start of plague in Nuremberg was one reason for his leaving.\nIn Italy, he went to Venice where artists were working in a more modern style. D\u00fcrer wrote that Giovanni Bellini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice.\nReturn to Nuremberg.\nOn his return to Nuremberg in 1495, D\u00fcrer opened his own workshop. He started to use what he learned in Italy more and more, so his work was quite different from the other artists in Nuremberg who used only the traditional German style.\nD\u00fcrer's father died in 1502 and his mother died in 1513.\nD\u00fcrer probably did not cut any of the woodblocks himself. This was a job for experts. But he had designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut as part of his training in Wolgemut's studio, and he had seen many carved and painted altarpieces made in the studio. This means he knew what could be made into a woodblock print, and how to work with the expert block cutters. D\u00fcrer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way his drawing was destroyed when the block was cut.\nHis famous series of sixteen great designs for the \"Apocalypse\" are dated 1498. He made the first seven scenes of the \"Great Passion\" in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. Around 1503\u20131505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the \"Great Passion,\" were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.\nThe Venetian artist Jacopo de' Barbari, whom D\u00fcrer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and D\u00fcrer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and Body proportions from him. de'Barbari did not want to tell D\u00fcrer everything he knew, so D\u00fcrer began his own studies, and he kept studying for the rest of his life. This is a series of drawings show D\u00fcrer's experiments in human proportion, before he made his famous engraving of \"Adam and Eve\" (1504). This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.\nD\u00fcrer made large numbers of other practice drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the \"Praying Hands\" (1508 Albertina, Vienna). He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of very beautiful still lives of meadow sections or animals, including his \"Hare\" (1502, Albertina, Vienna).\nSecond visit to Italy.\nIn early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507. By this time D\u00fcrer's engravings were very popular and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo. This was the altar-piece known as the \"Adoration of the Virgin\" or the \"Feast of Rose Garlands\". It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. Later, the Emperor Rudolf II took it to Prague. Other paintings D\u00fcrer made in Venice include, \"The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch\", \"Christ disputing with the Doctors\" (supposedly produced in just five days), and a number of smaller works.\nNuremberg and the masterworks.\nD\u00fcrer was admired by the Venetians, but he was back in Nuremberg by mid-1507. He stayed in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe. He was on friendly terms with most of the major artists of Europe, and exchanged drawings with Raphael.\nThe years between and his journey to the Netherlands are divided according to the type of work he made. During the first five years, 1507\u20131511, after his return from Venice D\u00fcrer mostly painted. He made his four best paintings, \"Adam and Eve\" (1507), \"Virgin with the Iris\" (1508), the altarpiece the \"Assumption of the Virgin\" (1509), and the \"Adoration of the Trinity by all the Saints\" (1511). During this period he also completed the two woodcut series, the \"Great Passion\" and the \"Life of the Virgin\".\nHe complained that painting did not make enough money, so from 1511 to 1514 he concentrated on printmaking. The famous works he made in this period were the thirty-seven woodcuts for the \"Little Passion\", published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. In 1513 and 1514 he created his three most famous engravings, \"The Knight, Death, and the Devil\" (or simply, \"The Knight\", as he called it, 1513), \"Melencolia I\", and \"St. Jerome in his Study\" (both 1514).\n'Melencolia I' has a magic square which is believed to be the first seen in European art. The two numbers in the middle of the bottom row give the date of the engraving, 1514.\nIn 1515, he created his woodcut of the \"Rhinoceros\". The rhinoceros was in Lisbon, but Durer never saw it. He made it from a sketch and description from another artist. It was not very lifelike, but still being used in some German school science text-books early last century. The rhinoceros was from an extinct Indian species.\nUp to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including portraits in tempera on linen, experiments in etching on plates of iron, and parts of the \"Triumphal Arch\" and the \"Triumphs of Maximilian\" which were huge woodcut projects ordered by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.\nJourney to the Netherlands and beyond.\nIn the summer of 1520 D\u00fcrer made his fourth and last major journey.\nHe wanted to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him. Maximilian had died in 1519, so the city of Nuremberg stopped paying it. D\u00fcrer also needed new patrons following the death of Maximilian, and to avoid an outbreak of sickness in Nuremberg.\nHe took his wife and her maid and left Nuremberg for the Netherlands in July 1520, to be at the coronation of the new emperor, Charles V. He travelled by the Rhine to Cologne, and then to Antwerp, where he made many drawings in silverpoint, chalk, and charcoal.\nD\u00fcrer went to Aachen for the coronation, but also made trips to Cologne, Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, and Zeeland. In Brussels he saw \"the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land\" \u2014 the Aztec treasure that Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. D\u00fcrer wrote that this treasure trove \"was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins\". D\u00fcrer appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.\nD\u00fcrer took many prints with him. He wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged, or sold them, and for how much. This is some of the few times the price of prints was recorded, so historians think it very important to show the values of prints compared to paintings at that time. D\u00fcrer returned home in July 1521. He had an unknown illness which stayed with him for the rest of his life, and slowed his rate of work.\nFinal years in Nuremberg.\nBack in Nuremberg, D\u00fcrer started work on a series of religious pictures. There are many practice sketches and \"studies\" (practice paintings for a bigger painting) but no big paintings from this time. This was partly because of his illness, but more because of the time he spent preparing to write books about geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.\nHis writings show that D\u00fcrer was highly sympathetic to Martin Luther, and he may have been influential in the City Council declaring for Luther in 1525. However, he died before religious divisions had hardened into different \"Catholic\" and \"Protestant\"churches. D\u00fcrer probably thought of himself as a reform-minded Catholic.\nD\u00fcrer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56. He left money and goods worth 6,874 florins - a considerable sum. His workshop was a part of his large house. His widow lived there until her death in 1537. The house is now a museum."}

He trained and became a master of that kind of art before travelling at 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570, he moved to Rome and opened a workshop and made a series of works. While he was in Italy, El Greco added elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance to his style. In 1577, at the age of 36, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death in 1614. In Toledo, El Greco painted his best-known paintings.\nEl Greco's dramatic and expressionist style puzzled other painters at the time, but came to be appreciated in the 20th century. El Greco is considered to have influenced both the Expressionist and Cubist styles. His personality and works inspired poets and writers like Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. Many modern scholars think that El Greco belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for long figures and often fantastic or dramatic coloring, combining Byzantine traditions with Western painting traditions. His paintings generally have very bright parts contrasting with very dark parts."}

His younger sister Margaret (1890\u20131974) married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Archibald Hill.\nKeynes first went to King\u2019s College, Cambridge, in 1902. At first he studied mathematics. Later he studied economics under A.C. Pigou and Alfred Marshall. People think Professor Marshall prompted Keynes to change his studies from mathematics and classics to economics. Keynes received his B.A. in 1905 and his M.A. in 1908.\nWhen Keynes was young, he had romantic and sexual relationships with men. One of his great loves was the artist Duncan Grant, whom he met in 1908. Keynes was also involved with the writer Lytton Strachey. Keynes appeared to turn away from homosexual relationships around the time of the first World War. In 1918, he met Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina. Keynes and Lopokova married in 1925.\nKeynes was a successful investor and he built up a big fortune. He nearly lost all of his money after the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Later he re-built his fortune.\nHe enjoyed collecting books: for example, he collected and protected many of Isaac Newton's papers.\nBertrand Russell said Keynes was the most intelligent person he had ever known. Lord Russell said: \"Every time I argued with Keynes, I felt that I took my life in my hands, and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool\".\nCareer.\nKeynes accepted a lectureship at Cambridge in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall. Soon he was appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, where he was able to put economic theory into practice.\nDuring World War I he worked for the Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to the Treasury on Financial and Economic Questions.\nKeynes also attended the Conference on the Versailles Treaty to end World War I. He wrote \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" in 1919, and \"A Revision of the Treaty\" in 1922. In his books he said that the reparations which Germany was being made to pay would ruin the German economy and would lead to further fighting in Europe. These predictions were shown to be true when the German economy suffered in the hyperinflation of 1923. Reparations were only completed in 2010.\nKeynes's \"magnum opus\" (Latin for \"Great Work\", meaning his most famous book) was the \"General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\". The \"General Theory\" was published in 1936. The ideas in that book were very different from classical economics.\nHistorians agree that Keynes influenced U.S. president Roosevelt's New Deal, but disagree as to what extent. Spending more than the government earned in taxes (called \"deficit spending\") was used in the New Deal from 1938. But the idea had been agreed to by President Herbert Hoover. Few senior economists in the U.S. agreed with Keynes in the 1930s. With time, however, his ideas became more widely accepted.\nIn 1942, Keynes was raised to the House of Lords. He became Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of Sussex. When he sat in the House of Lords he was a Liberal member.\nDuring World War II, Keynes wrote a book titled \"How to Pay for the War\". He said the war effort should be paid for by higher taxes. He did not like deficit spending because he wanted to avoid inflation.\nDeath.\nKeynes died of a heart attack at his holiday home in Tilton, East Sussex. His heart problems were made worse by the strain of working on post-war international financial problems. He died soon after he arranged a guarantee of an Anglo-American loan to Great Britain. Keynes' father, John Neville Keynes (1852\u20131949) outlived his son by three years. Keynes's brother Sir Geoffrey Keynes (1887\u20131982) was a distinguished surgeon, scholar and bibliophile. His nephews include Richard Keynes (born 1919) a physiologist; and Quentin Keynes (1921\u20132003) an adventurer and bibliophile. Keynes did not have children.\nInfluences on Keynes' works.\nThese people influenced Keynes:"}

Also known as the North American robin, it belongs in the thrush family, \"Turdidae\". It was named after the European robin. This is because the European robin has a bright orange-red face and breast. The two species are not closely related. The American robin has seven subspecies. \"T. m. confinis\" is the most different subspecies.\nThe American robin lives throughout North America. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe (a vagrant is a bird that is found outside its normal species' range). It has also been a vagrant to Greenland, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Belize. The American robin can be found in many different kinds of habitats. It likes open areas of ground to feed and areas with trees or shrubs to breed and sleep. Because it has a large range, the IUCN Red List says that the American robin will not decline, and is listed as of least concern.\nThe American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south. The female will choose where to build the nest. She will make the nest with grass, sticks, paper, feathers, rootlets, and moss. Once the nest is built, she will lay 3 to 5 eggs. After the chicks leave the nest, both parents will continue to take care of them, until they can live on their own.\nAmerican robin eggs and juveniles are eaten by squirrels, snakes, blue jays, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. The adults are eaten by hawks, cats, and larger snakes. Sometimes, the brown-headed cowbird lays its eggs in the Robin's nest. This is called brood parasitism. However, the robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs.\nEtymology.\nThis species was first described in 1766 by Linnaeus. It was described in the twelfth edition of his \"Systema naturae\". He called it \"Turdus migratorius\".\nDescription.\nThe American robin is large songbird. It has a round body. Its legs are long. It has a long tail. It has a long, yellow bill. It is dark gray-brown on its head, back, wings, and tail. It has an orange-red breast. There is a white patch on the underside of the belly, near the tail. This can be seen when it is flying. American robins that live in western North America are very pale (pale means light in color). American robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright. They have a white throat. It has black stripes in it. Females have lighter gray-brown heads than males. They also have lighter orange-red breasts. A young American robin (called a juvenile) is also lighter than the male. It has dark spots on its breast. Both sexes are 20\u201328 cm (7.9\u201311 in) long. They have a wingspan of 31\u201340\u00a0cm (12.2\u201315.7\u00a0in). American robins that live in western North America are very pale. American robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright.\nThe American robin was named after the European robin. This is because the European robin has a bright orange-red face and breast. The two species are not closely related.\nThe American robin has seven subspecies. They are very hard to tell apart and they do breed with each other.\nRange and distribution.\nThe American robin can be found all over North America. It is found from Alaska and Canada south to Mexico. Most American robins winter in Florida and the Gulf States to Mexico to the Pacific Coast. They will sometimes winter in southern Canada and the northern United States.\nThe American robin is a rare vagrant to western Europe. Most of the American robins have been found in Britain. The most recent sighting of an American robin in Britain was in January 2007. It has also been a vagrant to Greenland, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Belize.\nHabitat.\nAmerican robins are found in many different kinds of habitats. Some of them are gardens, parks, yards, fields, pastures, tundra, woodlands, pine forests, and shrublands. They like open areas of ground to feed. They like areas with trees or shrubs to breed and sleep.\nStatus.\nThe American robin has a large range. It is estimated that its range is 16 million square kilometers (6 million square miles). It is also estimated that there are about 320 million individual American robins. The IUCN Red List says that the species is not believed to reach the threat of decline. It is therefore considered Least Concern.\nAmerican robins used to be killed for their meat. They were killed in the southern states. The meat was thought as a very good food. The American robin is now protected in the United State by the Migratory Bird Act.\nBehavior.\nThe American robin is most active during the day. During the winter, it groups together in large flocks at night. They sleep together in thick vegetation. During the day, these large winter flocks break up into smaller flocks. They feed in these smaller flocks. During the summer, American robins are less social. This is because they are defending their breeding territories.\nJuvenile robins spend their first four months of life near their nesting place. They then flock together with other American Robins before they migrate to their wintering places.\nDiet.\nThe American robin eats invertebrates. In the spring, they like to eat earthworms and snails. Some other invertebrates that American robins eat are beetles, grubs, and caterpillars. It will also eat fruits and berries. Some kinds of berries that they like to eat are chokecherries, hawthorn berries, dogwood berries, sumac fruits, and juniper berries.\nBreeding.\nThe American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south. It is one of the first North American birds to lay eggs. It has two to three broods (a brood is a group of offspring) each breeding season. The breeding season starts in April and ends in July. It is one of the first birds to sing at dawn. Its song is made up of several small groups of sounds that are repeated.\nNest.\nThe female chooses where to make the nest. She will usually make the nest on one or many branches that are hidden in leaves. In the west, the female will make the nest on the ground or in thickets. In Alaska, the female will make the nest on a cliff. The female makes the nest. She starts with the inside. She uses grass and sticks to make a cup-shaped center. Other things that the female will use are paper, feathers, rootlets, and moss. After the center is done, she uses mud on the outside of the nest to make it stronger. She then puts soft grass in the cup. The nest is usually 15.2 to 20.3\u00a0cm (6 to 8 in) long. It is 7.6 to 15.2\u00a0cm high (3 to 6 in).\nEggs and young.\nThe female will lay 3 to 5 eggs in the nest. They are blue or blue-green. They are 2.8 to 3\u00a0cm (1.1 to 1.2 in) long. They are 2.1\u00a0cm (0.8\u00a0in) wide. Only the female incubates the eggs (incubate means that the adult will sit on the eggs and keep them warm and help the babies inside grow). It takes 12 to 14 days for the eggs to hatch.\nFor the first few days, the chicks have no feathers and their eyes are closed. The young live in the nest for about 13 days. As the chicks grow older, the female will protect them only at night and during bad weather. After the juveniles leave the nest, they will follow their parents around and beg them for food.\nBoth parents help feed and protect the fledged (fledged means a young bird that has just learned how to fly) juveniles until they can live on their own. The adults will give an alarm call to warn the juveniles that there is a predator near by. The parents will then attack the predator. Some of the predators they will attack are cats and dogs. They will even go after humans if the human gets close to their young. Fledged juveniles are only able to fly short distances. The coloring of the juveniles helps them hide better in bushes or trees. This kind of coloring is called camouflage.\nBird banders have found that only 25% of juvenile American robins live through their first year. The average life of an American Robin lasts about 2 years. The longest known lifespan of a wild American Robin is 14 years.\nThreats.\nPredators.\nEggs and juvenile robins that still live in the nest are eaten by squirrels and snakes. Some birds also eat eggs and juvenile robins. When feeding together in flocks, American robins will watch each other for signs of predators. If a predator is seen, they will make a warning call. Sometimes, the Brown-headed Cowbird lays its eggs in the robin's nest. This is called brood parasitism. The robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs. Because of this, brood parasitism by the cowbird is rare.\nDisease.\nThe American robin is known to carry a disease called the West Nile Virus. This disease comes from mosquitoes. Crows and jays are the first to die from this disease. The American robin is more responsible for the transmission of the disease to humans. This is because it lives longer with the disease than the crows and jays. This allows it to spread the disease to more mosquitoes which then spread the disease to humans and other animals.\nIn culture.\nThe American robin is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It was also shown on a 1986 Canadian $2 note, but it is no longer on the bill.\nThere is color named after the American robin's eggs. It is called \"robin's egg blue\".\nThe robin is considered a symbol of spring. A good example is a poem by Emily Dickinson. It is called \"I Dreaded That First Robin So\". There are other poems about the first robin of spring. One of them is \"The First Robin\" by Dr. William H. Drummond. According to the author's wife, it is based on a Quebec false belief. The belief says that whoever sees the first robin of spring will have good luck."}

His father Albert Dupr\u00e9 was organist at the gothic abbey of St Ouen in Rouen. The young Marcel was a child prodigy. He entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1904, where he studied the piano and organ. He studied organ with Alexandre Guilmant and Louis Vierne, and Charles-Marie Widor. His studies with Widor also included composition. In 1914, Dupr\u00e9 won the Grand Prix de Rome for his cantata, \"Psych\u00e9\". Twelve years later, he became professor of organ at the Paris Conservatoire, serving until 1954.\nAmong his best-known work were more than 2,000 organ recitals in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia. In 1920 he played in a series of concerts at the Paris Conservatoire in which he played the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach from memory. \nIn 1934 he succeeded Widor as organist at St. Sulpice in Paris, serving until his death.\nFrom 1947 to 1954, he was director of the American Conservatory, which was in the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau near Paris. In 1954, Dupr\u00e9 succeeded Claude Delvincourt (who had been killed in a car crash) as director of the Paris Conservatoire, serving until 1956. He died at the age of 85.\nHis playing.\nDupr\u00e9's organ recitals often included his own work, as well as those of other composers, especially Bach. In the tradition of Widor and Vierne, his compositions included long works in several movements which he called \u201csymphonies\u201d. When he played in church services he would start by playing composed music which was suitable for the time of year. Then he would improvise, playing complicated fugues, trio sonatas and chorale improvisations. He was so good at improvising that many people thought he had composed the music beforehand.\nWhen playing in concerts he was often given a tune, and then he would immediately make up a large work from that tune. In 1906, when he was still a student, he played for a wedding and two services when the famous Widor was going to be absent. Dupr\u00e9 asked Widor what music he should play. Widor told him to improvise something. Dupr\u00e9 waited for Widor to go out of the church before he started practising, but Widor crept back in and listened to him. He realized that Dupr\u00e9 would manage very well.\nHis teaching.\nDupr\u00e9 was famous as an organ teacher. He taught two generations of well-known organists including Jehan Alain, Marie-Claire Alain, Pierre Cochereau, Jeanne Demessieux,Jean Guillou, Jean Langlais, and Olivier Messiaen. \nHis compositions.\nDupr\u00e9 composed a great deal of organ music. As a young child he got to know Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll, the most famous organ builder in France. Cavaill\u00e9-Coll had built the organ that Dupr\u00e9\u2019s father played, so he was used to the sound of modern French organs. Most of Dupr\u00e9's music for the organ is very difficult to play. It includes the \"Three Preludes and Fugues\", Op. 7 (1914). Even Widor thought that the Prelude of the third piece was simply impossible to perform. However, Dupr\u00e9 could play it, and many organists after him learned to play it, too. Other notable works of Dupr\u00e9's include the \"Symphonie-Passion\", the \"Esquisses\" and \"\u00c9vocation\", and the \"Cort\u00e8ge et Litanie\". \nAs well as composing lots of music, Dupr\u00e9 prepared study editions of the organ works of Bach, Handel, Mozart, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Schumann, C\u00e9sar Franck, and Alexander Glazunov. He also wrote music for people who were learning to play the organ, and books on how to improvise on the organ.\nReferences.\n\u201cMarcel Dupr\u00e9 at Saint-Sulpice\u201d \u2013 Gerard Brooks: Organist\u2019s Review Aug 1986 p.\u00a0161-166"}

He was born in Roccasecca, as the son of Count Andulf of Aquino and Countess Theodora of Teano.\nHis early education was at the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino. He attended the University of Naples, where he got the nickname \"dumb ox\" for his slow demeanor, though he was an intelligent and talented student. He studied philosophy, Catholic theology, church history, liturgy, and canon law. \nBy 1240, he became interested in the religious life and decided to become a friar with the new Dominican Order. His family captured him and brought him back because to become a Dominican one must eliminate material wealth. His parents expected him to follow in his uncle\u2019s footsteps and become a Benedictine abbot. They kept him in a castle in an effort to change his mind. However, when they released him two years later, he immediately joined the Dominicans.\nHe was the author of the cosmological argument. Catholics think Aquinas is the best teacher for one who wants to become a priest. His most famous book is \"Summa Theologica.\" Aquinas is one of the 33 Doctors of the Church. Many schools are named after him including the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines.\nAquinas is also known for his work with natural law. Aquinas took an optimistic view of human nature, believing that it is human nature to do good and not evil."}

The ovary wall is hard (stony or woody) when it matures, and the seed is stuck to the ovary wall.\nTypes of nuts.\nTypes of nuts include the oak, hickory, chestnut, stone-oak, birch, and hazelnut.

It is at version 1.341. \"Notrium\" was developed by independent Finnish programmer Ville M\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen. It is the seventh game that Ville has made, but it is only the fifth game to be made in English. Released in 2003, it won second place in the 'Adventure Game of the Year' contest on GameTunnel.\nSetting.\nLocation.\nThe game takes place on the invented planet Notrium. The game world is split up into squares, each of which has its own climate, land, and goals. The player can move between squares to reach the other areas, though some of the areas can only be reached by using vehicles or teleportation. There are climates such as jungle, desert, and tundra. All area squares can are changed by a day-night cycle, except for levels that are set indoors.\nThe game's graphics are all randomly generated (put together) at the start of the game, except in special game areas. This random generation changes where items and plants are, though most items and scenery will stay in their environment square. Environment squares do not change when the game is started. For example, a tree in the Jungle zone will be put in a different place each time a new game is begun, but the player character will still start in the same place as always.\nStory.\nThe plot of the game is that a team of four, an Alien, a Human, an Android (a robot), and a Psionic creature, have left Earth in a spacecraft, because Earth was going to be destroyed. After the player has chosen the character he/she wants to control, the game begins. The spacecraft is shot at by missiles from the planet Notrium, which is close by. The player's character gets into an escape pod and crashes on the planet's surface. From there, the player must find a way to survive, as well as a way to escape.\nJournal entries, which are different for each character, appear every game day for two game weeks. These entries tell about what happened to the characters while they were on the spacecraft. For example, the journal of the Human tells that he was the captain of the ship; while the journal of the Android shows that he was the ship's mechanic. Other happenings can be discovered by going to special places in the game, or finishing a goal.\n\"Notrium\" has more than one ending to the game. Different characters can get different endings. Some endings can only be won by one character, while other endings can be won by other characters as well.\nGameplay.\nA person plays \"Notrium\" looking from a top-down view. The player may move in all directions while facing in a different one, similar to the way a first-person shooter is controlled, and similar to the freeware PC shooter game \"Crimsonland\". \nDuring the game, the player can find items and objects, such as plants, weapons, and machines. Most important items, like a force field to protect the character, are not found in one piece. The player can build them out of two or three other parts. \nGameplay is about collecting parts to build, defending from enemies, and then winning one of the game's endings. Depending on the character the player has picked, the game is played in a different way. The fast-moving Alien starts with a very strong attack and gets more attacks over time, but it cannot use any weapons. The Human starts with a very weak attack, but he can make many weapons and armor to get more powerful.\nThe game also has weather. If \"Notrium\" is played on a setting harder than 'easy', the character will be changed by the weather. Standing near a fire will make the player more hot, and standing under a tree will make the player less hot. In some areas of the game, there is dangerous weather, like sandstorms, blizzards, or acid rain.\nMods.\n\"Notrium\" was made to be easy to mod (change), and a guide about how to change is on Ville's website. \nWhen the player starts a new game after getting a new mod, he or she can choose what mod they want to play. \nMods can make many changes, such as putting new items or goals into the game, changing or making new environment squares. Mods can even make a new character that the player can choose, such as in the 'Werivar' mod."}

Before the building opened, it was called Burj Dubai. The building is 162 stories high. Construction of the tower was started on 6 January 2004, and the building was officially opened on 4 January 2010, almost 6 years later. It is the tallest structure made by humans in the world. The building is more than taller than Taipei 101. Taipei 101 was the tallest building until 2010 before Burj Khalifa was built.\nAdrian Smith designed the tower. He worked with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) until 2006. It was built by Samsung Engineering &amp; Construction, Besix, and Arabtec. The tower cost US $1.5 billion to build. The building is part of a building project on Sheikh Zayed Road, Downtown Burj Khalifa. It is near Dubai's main business district.\nThe building and planning.\nThe main contractor was Samsung C&amp;T of South Korea. They also built the Taipei 101 and Petronas Twin Towers. Other contractors who helped with the building included Belgian group Besix and Arabtec from the UAE. The Turner Construction Company was chosen as the construction project manager.\nThe design architect, Adrian Smith, did not like the first design of the upper part of the building. He added 27 new floors and an aluminium spire to the top of the plans. The design of Burj Khalifa based on those used in Islamic architecture. Burj Khalifa has been said to have had several other planned height increases since it was first built. This has not been proven to be true yet. The TV/radio communications mast was added to the tower's plans in 2007. This was after building work had begun in 2006. There are pressurized, air-conditioned refuge floors about every 35 floors. These were put into the tower in case of an emergency or fire.\nThe unusual design and engineering problems of building Burj Khalifa have been shown in many television documentaries. These include the \"Big, Bigger, Biggest\" series on the National Geographic and Five channels, and the \"Mega Builders\" series on the Discovery Channel.\nThe most important building material of Burj Khalifa is reinforced concrete. A special concrete was needed because of the high pressures of the building's weight and the hot local climate of Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach . Any major cracks could have caused a large amount of damage to the building.\nThe foundation of the building is deep. It was built with 192 columns being put into the ground. Each column was in diameter and long. of steel rebar was used in the construction of the tower. It took 22\u00a0million man-hours to build. A high density, low permeability concrete was used in the foundations of Burj Khalifa. A cathodic protection system is used to lessen any bad effects from corrosive chemicals in local ground water.\nThe Dubai Fountain.\nA fountain system was built outside the tower. It was designed by WET Design of California. They built and planned out the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel Lake in Las Vegas. The fountain cost UAEd 800 million. It is lit by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors. The fountain is long. It shoots water into the air to the sounds of classical and modern Arabic and world music. On 26 October 2008, the fountain was named the Dubai Fountain.\nDelays and late building work.\nEmaar Properties said on 9 June 2008 that construction of Burj Khalifa was slowed because of changes to finishes. An Emaar official said that the luxury finishes that were decided on in 2004, when the tower was first planned, were being being replaced by better finishes. The design of the apartments were also made better. This was done to make them both look better and work better. There were problems with the marble decorations, flooring, the top floors' sanitation system, broken glasswork and a poorly done wall mural of the Sultan of Oman. A new ending date of 2 December, 2009, was then given. Burj Khalifa opened on 4 January 2010.\nWorkers' disputes and strikes..\nBurj Khalifa was built mainly by people from South Asia. Press reports said in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned UK\u00a34.34 a day, and labourers earned UK\u00a32.84. According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers lived in very bad conditions. Often they were not paid for the work. Their passports were taken by their employers. It was said that they were working in dangerous conditions that caused high number of deaths and injuries. Companies not paying workers has been reported to the authorities several times.\nOn 21 March 2006, about 2,500 workers protested. They were mad about buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts. They damaged cars, offices, computers, and construction equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said they caused almost UK\u00a3500,000 in damage. Most of the workers who were part of the riot returned the following day but would not work.\nRecords set.\nThe building is not only the tallest building in the world, it also holds the following records-"}

It is built of masonry and held in place just by gravity. It was the first dam across the Nile, and was built by the British between 1899 and 1902. When it was done, it was the largest masonry dam in the world. This type of dam is called a buttress dam.\nThe dam was built at the former first cataract of the Nile, and is about 1000\u00a0km up-river and 690\u00a0km (direct distance) south-southeast of Cairo. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted.\nThe dam was designed to provide storage of annual floodwater. The water was used to help dry season flow and support more irrigation. Its height was originally limited because of concern for the Temple of Isis at Phillae (Philae Temple). That temple was later moved to Agilkia Island in Lake Nasser.\nThe dam provided inadequate storage capacity for planned development and was raised twice, between 1907\u20131912 and again 1929\u20131933. These heightenings still did not meet irrigation demands and in 1946 it was nearly over-topped by water in an effort to maximize pool elevation.\nThis eventually led to the construction of the Aswan High Dam upstream.\nThe second function of the dam is to provide electricity. The dammed water drives a water turbine and generator. It still works today. This technology (hydroelectricity) had been invented in the 19th century in England and Germany, and was by 1900 used in the USA and most European countries.\nEgypt got access to the technology because she was, at that time, under British control. The Khedive was Abbas II, who usually had to do what the British wanted."}

The fort was used until 1910, upon which the fort became useless.\nThe fort that had 2 six inch gun emplacements and special lookout positions was reused during World War II to protect the entrance to Botany Bay. The underground bunker and tunnels inside the fort had vaulted weapons storage rooms with double walls and ceilings. The doubling up of walls and ceilings was a special way of stoppng the walls from collapsing if the fort suffered a direct hit from a missile (rocket) fired from an enemy ship. The battery is currently not in use."}

The Georges Head fort is one of many forts that were built on Sydney Harbour meant to defend the colony of New South Wales, just encase another country tried to invade our country Australia. The fort became the boss of all other forts in the 1890s organizing all of Sydney's harbour forts.\nHistory.\nThe area where the fort is was once home to Aborigines that lived in the area for thousands of years and long before Europeans visited and decided to stay.\nGeorges Head fort was built in 1871 after the British Army decided to leave Australia in 1870. When they left the responsibility for protecting Sydney and Sydney Harbour was now in the hands of rich colonies like New South Wales and Victoria who now had to organise its own defences.\nGeorges Head was near the entrance to Sydney Harbour and was meant to attack baddies (foreign ships that are not friendlies) before they could get into the harbour. The fort was on a very good spot and was positioned high above sea level with clear views to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour/Sydney Heads). Other forts were also on Middle Head, South Head, Shark Point and Bradleys Head, but none were ever used for fighting ships or troops from other countrys.\nGeorges Head was armed with four 80 pounder cannons and two 68 pounder cannons. These cannons were 'muzzle-loading', which meant the cannonballs or bullets along with the explosive charge (T.N.T dynamite) were loaded into the front of the cannons barrel. It took three months and 250 soldiers to roll the gun barrels all the way from North Sydney to the forts. They came along a dirt road which later became Military Road. Once they were put in place, the cannons had been placed so close together that it created the risk of one cannon firing upon another. Also, the cannons and the men could be seen from ships in the harbour. In 1877 large mounds of earth were placed between the pits to make sure the guns neither could fire upon each other and to help protect the gun crew from enemy fire. When construction of the fort was finalised, there were a total of 41 gun emplacements around Sydney Harbour.\nThe planning of defence was planned using telescopes and plotters sitting in the middle of the second gun pit. From the telephone exchange, the Port Jackson District Commandant could talk with all the other forts around the harbour. Telephone wires ran through tunnels, down the cliff and under the harbour to forts on the other side.\nGeorges Head was later chosen as the best place to spy and fire mines which were laid underwater. In 1888 Georges Head battery was upgraded for the latest in harbour defences in the form of submarine bombs. Minefields were laid across the main shipping channels of Port Jackson from 1876 to 1922 and a base was built at Chowder Bay for the submarine miners. From Georges Head, miners watched for ships entering the harbour. Their job was to explode the mine closest to an approaching enemy ship. Each underwater mine was attached to an electric cable that ran up the cliff to the firing post.\nThe work of the submarine miner was secretive, technical and dangerous. During a demonstration in 1891, a crowd of several thousand watched as a terrible accident killed four miners and injured another eight."}

He is one of the greatest contributors to the D\u00eev\u00e2n tradition of Turkish literature,\nFuz\u00fbl\u00ee wrote his collected poems (d\u00eev\u00e2n) in three different languages: Azerbaijani Turkish, Persian, and Arabic. Although his Turkish works are written in Azerbaijani, he knew both the Ottoman and the Chagatai Turkish literary traditions as well. He was also very able in mathematics and astronomy.\nLife.\nFuz\u00fbl\u00ee was born around 1483 in what is now Iraq; he was probably born in either Karbal\u0101\u2019 or an-Najaf. Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee's ancestors had been of nomadic origin, but his family had long since settled in towns.\nFuz\u00fbl\u00ee was educated by his father\u2014who was a mufti in the city of Al Hillah \u2014 and then by a teacher named Rahmetullah. It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani.\nOne of the few things that is known of Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the introduction to his collected Persian poems, he says: \"In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name\". Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word \"fuz\u00fbl\u00ee\"\u2014which literally means \"impertinent, improper, unnecessary\"\u2014because he \"knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else\".Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning\u2014what is called \"tevriyye\" (\u062a\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0647) in Ottoman Divan poetry \u2014 as Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee himself explains: \"I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary \"fuz\u00fbl\" (\ufed3\ufec0\ufeee\u0644) is given as a plural of \"fazl\" (\ufed3\ufec0\ufede; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as \"\u2018ul\u00fbm\" (\ufecb\ufee0\ufeee\u0645; 'sciences') and \"f\u00fcn\u00fbn\" (\ufed3\ufee8\ufeee\u0646; 'arts')\".\nIn 1534, the Ottoman sultan S\u00fcleym\u00e2n I conquered the region of Baghdad, where Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee lived, from the Safavid Empire. Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee now had the chance to become a court poet under the Ottoman patronage system, and he composed a number of poems in praise of the sultan, and as a result, he was granted a stipend. But he did not really get it. Therefore he citicized bureaucracy in one of his best-known works, the letter \"\u015eik\u00e2yetn\u00e2me\" (\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647; \"Complaint\"):\nThe loss of his stipend meant that Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee never became secure.

As in the pipe organ, the sound is made by air blowing through the pipes, but power to make the air blow does not come from bellows or from electricity as in the modern organ, but from water, for example from a waterfall.\nA hydraulis is an early type of pipe organ that was powered by water. It was invented in the 3rd century B.C., probably by the Hellenistic scientist Ctesibius of Alexandria. It was the world's first keyboard instrument. Many centuries later it developed into the modern pipe organ.\nThe water organ works by having water and air arriving together in the camera aeolis (wind chamber). Here, water and air separate and the compressed air is driven into a wind-trunk on top of the camera aeolis, to blow the organ pipes. Two perforated \u2018splash plates\u2019 or \u2018diaphragms\u2019 stop the water spray from getting into the organ pipes. \nThe water, having been separated from the air, leaves the camera aeolis at the same speed as it enters. It then drives a water wheel, which in turn drives the musical cylinder and the movements attached. To start the organ, the tap above the entry pipe is turned on and, given a continuous flow of water, the organ plays until the tap is closed again. \nDuring the Renaissance many Italian gardens had water organs. The most famous water organ of the 16th century was at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli. It was about 6 metres high and was powered by a beautiful waterfall. It could play three pieces automatically, but there was also a keyboard."}

A machine should have a user interface that can be handled easily, even if the person operating the machine has panicked. The user interface should therefore be intuitive, and simple to use. An example of such a user interface is that of the kill switch. A kill switch must shut off the machine at all costs - the idea is to avoid injury or harm to people. This is very different from shutting off the machine at the end of the shift, or when it is no longer needed.\nAccording to EN ISO 13850, the kill switch has to be red on a yellow background. \nThe colors used to mark different states are close to those used by signals used on the road.\nThere may be additional symbols, for example:\nIn many cases, such symbols are better, because some people are color blind. They need to be explained, like warnings, though.\nUser interfaces are composed of one or more layers including a human-machine interface (HMI) using physical input devices such as keyboards, mice, and game pads as well as output hardware such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers. User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI brings together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture. \nUI design is closely linked to user experience (UX) design. Both are crucial for the success of a digital product, and both terms are often used interchangeably. However, they\u2019re not the same thing. UI design is the process of creating interfaces with a focus on the surface, the looks, and style, while UX design covers the entire experience a user has with a website or app."}

The word was then used in the late 19th century (1800s) for poor painters, writers, musicians and actors who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money. Paris was a famous town for painters, writers, and musicians to gather, to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city. Many of them lived at Montmartre, not far from the \"Moulin Rouge\". One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. He loved to paint the can-can dancers and prostitutes. He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs. The posters are now famous works of art. \nIn the 20th century the word \"Bohemian\" spread to other countries and was used to describe the lives of many different artists of different sorts. The sort of behaviour that was thought of as \"Bohemian\" included whether a person had a regular job, how they dressed, their political views, their religious views, their sexual behaviour and the entertainment they liked. \nPeople who were called \"Bohemians\" were often very poor, because they tried to live by painting, acting or writing. It was hard to make a living. They generally wore old or second-hand clothing, and could not afford a good hair-cut. They often shared the room in the roof of a house, which was cheap, because it was cold in winter, hot in summer and often had birds living there as well. In some ways the life of a bohemian artist was difficult, but it gave people freedom to express themselves, that was often not found in more conservative society, where everyone worried about what other people thought of them, and cared a lot about things like clothes and houses. Sometimes students from richer families would come to live a \"Bohemian life style\", so that they could feel the same freedom to express themselves. \nDuring the 20th century, many cities apart from Paris have areas where people have lived Bohemian lifestyles. One of the problems is that these areas often become fashionable for rich people. This soon drives away the poor artists and students, because they can no longer afford the rent.\nBohemian areas.\nBohemian areas in different cities are: "}

He also built an organ for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. Many of the organs that he built are in other parts of the world, especially in countries that belonged to the British Empire. \nMany organists who gave organ recitals liked Henry Willis\u2019s organs because they had lots of different sounds which helped to make the organ sound like an orchestra. He made organs for churches where the architects were getting rid of the central screen so that the organ could be heard better in the main part of the church (the nave). He used ideas that had been created by the French organ builder Cavaill\u00e9-Coll and by Barker. He made several inventions himself, including the thumb piston, which made it possible for an organist to change the combination of stops without taking his hands off the keyboard.\nFour generations of the Willis family continued the family tradition of organ building until 1997, when Henry Willis IV retired and the new Managing Director of the firm was not a member of the Willis family.

C\u00e9sar Franck, Alexandre Guilmant, and Charles-Marie Widor, in particular, were strongly influenced by the new type of organ that he was building.\nCavaill\u00e9-Coll grouped the stops of the organ into different families, so that the result was similar to the families of instruments in an orchestra. He made the lowest of the manuals (keyboards) the most important one. It was called the \u201cGreat\u201d (French: \u201cGrande Orgue\u201d). The other manuals - there were usually two others, but sometimes three - could be \u201ccoupled\u201d to the Great. He made changes to the English swell box, improved its operation, and divided the windchests on which the pipes were resting. This made it possible to have louder reed stops because of the higher wind pressure."}

He built harpsichords, clavichords, organs, and pianos. \nLife.\nHe was born in Kleinbobritzsch and learnt organ construction from his brother in Stra\u00dfburg. In 1711 Silbermann opened his own workshop in Freiberg and then in 1723 got the title \"Honorary Court and State Organ Builder to the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony\" from Frederick I. Gottfried Silbermann designed and built approximately 50 organs. He had different ideas about organ building from Arp Schnitger who was an organ builder in the north of Germany. Silbermann's organs were some of the best instruments in the south of Germany, some of them still exist. The Hofkirche organ and that of Freiberg Cathedral are considered his greatest works. \nSilbermann's pianos.\nSilbermann also played a big role in the history of the piano. He constructed the first German fortepiano in 1732. During the 1740s, King Frederick the Great of Prussia became acquainted with Silbermann's pianos and bought a number of them. He employed Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach who was playing Silbermann fortepianos and wrote music for this particular fortepiano model. They were also played by Johann Sebastian Bach during his visit to Potsdam where during his second visit Silbermann pianos met Bach's \"complete approval\". In 2020 Paul McNulty made a copy of Gottfried Silbermann\u2019s 1749 instrument for Malcolm Bilson."}

Their business manager was an American named Allen Klein, who also worked for Donovan, The Animals, and later The Rolling Stones and The Beatles.\nNone of the members was really named Herman. Lead singer Peter Noone (pronounced \"noon\") was nicknamed Herman, because his bandmates thought he looked like Sherman, from \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\". Noone was an actor before he became a singer. The other band members were Derek \"Lek\" Leckenby (guitar), Keith Hopwood (guitar, keyboards), Karl Green (bass guitar) and Barry Whitwam (drums). The band began as amateurs, playing at parties for friends, but turned professional as they improved. They made records, appeared on television, and also made movies.\nThe Hermits's hit records included \"I'm Into Something Good\", \"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat?\", \"There's A Kind Of Hush (All Over The World)\", \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\", \"Listen People\", and cover versions of \"Silhouettes\", \"Sea Cruise\", and \"The End Of The World\". \"Hold On\" was the title song of their first movie. \"Mrs. Brown, You've Got A Lovely Daughter\" was a hit song first, that was later fitted to a movie storyline.\nHerman's Hermits stopped having hits as music trends changed, but their old songs were well loved. They are still played today. The band members went on to other careers in the 1970s. Peter Noone went back to acting, but still appeared as a singer.\nIn the 1980s, Leckenby and Whitwam formed a new band, to tour under the old name. The singer sounded like Noone, and many fans did not know the difference. Other original members also sometimes rejoined.

The official name is The Mengniu Yoghurt Super Girl Contest, after the company that sponsored the show. It is now one the most popular entertainment shows in China. However, after the third season, the show was banned by the Chinese government. The show was the feature of a 2007 documentary titled Super, Girls!, produced and directed by independent Chinese filmmaker Jian Yi on the 2006 Super Voice Girls contest, released at the Cambridge Film Festival. An ARTiSIMPLE Studio production, \"Super, Girls!\" is the only independent feature-length documentary ever made about the \"Super Girls.\"\nOutline.\nThe competition was open to any female regardless of age, origin or appearance. The audition sessions had females ranging from 4 to 89 years old. The 2005 season of the contest attracted more than 120,000 applicants during the preliminary selection rounds, held in the provinces Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Henan and Zhejiang. Many applicants travelled long distances to take part in the competition. Each contestant was allowed 30 seconds to perform to judges and find out if they were selected for the preliminary regional rounds. To prevent another overwhelming audition season, the minimum age of 18 was later set during the 2006 season.\nFollowing the selection of contestants in the five regions, the competition began with the preliminary rounds. Preliminaries were held in each of the five locations where auditions were located. Vviewers were able to watch each of the preliminaries and vote for their favorite singers. Voting was conducted by telephone and SMS.\nThe regional preliminaries are followed by a weekly broadcast single-elimination (knockout) tournament held in Changsha, Hunan. The least voted two face-off subsequently in a \"PK.\" The term \"PK\" comes from \"Player Kill,\" a reference to kill-or-be-killed online games. The singer with the least number of votes is then eliminated. The last event is contested between the final 3.\nJudges for the competition were selected from different backgrounds in society. \"Audience judges\" were selected in addition to several professional judges.\nHistory.\nThe original version of the show was known as \"Super Boy\" and aired in 2003 on Hunan Entertainment Channel, a local broadcaster based in Changsha, Hunan. The show was a success and the counterpart \"Super Girl\" aired at the beginning of 2004 and became the most viewed show in Hunan. However, the programme's impact was limited as the channel does not broadcast outside the province.\nOn May 6, 2004, \"Super Girl\" was introduced to a national audience by its producer Liao Ke through Hunan Satellite Television. In addition to broadcasting the original episodes created by Hunan Entertainment Channel, the network also developed this show in other 3 cities: Wuhan in Hubei, Nanjing in Jiangsu and Chengdu in Sichuan. This show attracted an average of 10,000 contestants in each city and received nationwide attention.\nHunan Satellite Television introduced a second season of \"Super Girl\" on March 19, 2005. The preliminary rounds were filmed in five cities: Changsha in Hunan Province, Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, Zhengzhou in Henan Province, Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, and Chengdu in Sichuan Province. By the middle of the season, the competition captivated a nationwide audience and became one of the most watched television entertainment shows in China with tens of millions of viewers.\nCultural impact.\nThe final episode of the 2005 season was one of the most popular shows in Chinese broadcast history, drawing more than 400,000,000 viewers, more than CCTV's New Year's Gala earlier that year. The final peaked at 280,000,000 viewers at a given time, higher than the 12,000,000-viewer figure for the finals of \"Pop Idol\". Despite the show being condemned by CCTV as being \"vulgar and manipulative\", season 3 of the show was launched and finished in early October 2006.\nOn January 18, 2006, China National Philatelic Corporation released a postage stamp issue featuring 2005 winner Li Yu Chun. The set was shortly earlier than Li's twenty-second birthday in her commemoration.\nOn May 11, 2009, \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", a worldwide famous television show, invited Zhang Liangying, who ranked 3rd overall in the 2005 contest, to make an American television singing debut. The subtitle of the show was \"The World's Got Talent\" and Zhang Liangying was the only east Asian singer in the show.\nSome who were not chosen as winners have also been able to enter the recording industry through other means. Ji Min Jia, who ranked fifth overall in the 2005 contest, worked in Los Angeles in 2006 to help with production of the title song for Japanese anime series \"The Galaxy Railways\". On March 15, 2007, Japanese recording group Hello! Project announced Li Chun, one of the top 50 contestants in the 2006 Changsha regional, as one of two new members of Chinese ancestry of its pop group Morning Musume.\nThe contest has also inspired television producers to create other talent search shows.\nDemocratic expression.\nOne of the main factors contributing to the show's popularity was that viewers are able to participate in the judging process by sending SMSs with their mobile phones to vote for their favorite contestants. During the 2005 regional contest in Chengdu alone, 307,071 message votes were cast for the top three contestants, each vote costing \u00a50.5 to \u00a53.\nOver 800,000,000 text messages were sent during the third season of \"Super Girl\", and fan clubs began to appear throughout the country. After the large response to the ability to vote, the Chinese government banned the show from continuing to a fourth season. The show was the feature of a 2007 documentary titled \"Super, Girls!\", produced and directed by independent Chinese filmmaker Jian Yi on the 2006 Super Voice Girls contest, released at the Cambridge Film Festival. An ARTiSIMPLE Studio production, \"Super, Girls!\" is the only independent feature-length documentary ever made about the \"Super Girls.\"\nWhile some culture and media experts praised \"Super Girl\" in blazing \"a trail for cultural democracy\" and breaking elitism in China's entertainment industry, others stated that \"the show represented a superficiality in society, propelled by behind-the-scenes manipulation and state-of-the-art pomp and circumstance\".\nEconomic impact.\nMengniu reportedly paid \u00a514,000,000 to Hunan Television for rights to sponsor the show's broadcast outside Hunan province beginning with the 2005 season. The 2005 contest was estimated to have drawn in a total of \u00a5766,000,000. Indirect business impact of the competition was estimated at several billion yuan.\nTelevision advertisement slots cost an average of \u00a533,400 for 15 seconds in 2006, compared to the average of \u00a528,000 in 2005. Advertising sales were expected to reach \u00a5200,000,000, nearly double that of the previous year.\n2004 season.\nThe first season of \"Super Girl\" aired from 6 May to September 22, 2004.

There was much controversy about the Li Yu Chun being the season's grand champion as she had the most votes even though she had \"the weakest voice among the top finalists\". Despite the heavy criticism that arose during the competition season, the three 2005 finalists have been considered the most successful singers from the entire show.\n2006.\nThe third season of aired from April 2 to September 30, 2006. Shang Wen Jie's selection as grand champion over Tan Wei Wei, who is a professional vocalist from Sichuan Conservatory of Music, raised questions at each candidate's public appeal. Speculations arose that Shang, who appeared to be a copycat of Li Yu Chun's image, was voted grand champion due to the appeal of her Cinderella story."}

The title was often used by English composers in the late Renaissance or Baroque periods for a piece of organ music that was free in style, i.e. it did not have to be composed in a strict form such as sonata form or a fugue. It was meant to sound as if it was being improvised (the word voluntary in general means \u201cfree\u201d, i.e. not \u201cforced to do something\u201d).\nComposers such as Orlando Gibbons, John Blow and Henry Purcell wrote voluntaries, although sometimes they preferred to use other titles such as \"fancy\" (an English form of the Italian word \"fantasia\"), or even \"fugue\". However, these \"fugues\" were not composed in the proper fugue style: they just started off with imitation as in a fugue, but continued in a freer style.\nSome voluntaries were called \"double voluntaries\". These were pieces written for organs with two manuals (keyboards). The pieces contrasted a loud manual with a soft one.\nSome voluntaries were known as \"trumpet voluntaries\". These were voluntaries which had a tune which was played (with the right hand) on a stop called a \u201ctrumpet\u201d or a \u201ccornet\u201d. Two very famous trumpet voluntaries, often played at weddings, are the trumpet voluntary by Henry Purcell and the one by Jeremiah Clarke (which people used to think was composed by Purcell).

When a person changes their main home in Germany, or buys a new automobile, they must buy new number plates.\nNumber plates can be bought which are valid all year round or between 2 to 11 months within any 12 months. This allows changing between summer and winter automobiles, such as a convertible and a sedan/saloon without having the time and money wasted for de- and re-registering.\nFormat.\nThe present number plate format, used since 1994, uses black print on a white background and first provides information about the country where the automobile is registered within the European Union. German licence plates show a \"D\" (for \"Deutschland\"=\"Germany\") on the blue strip on the left, which shows the European Union's flag, 12 golden stars in a circle on blue ground.\nAfter that, there are between one and three letters for the city or region where the automobile is registered, such as B for Berlin. These units usually coincide with the German districts, in few cases an urban district and the surrounding district share the same letter code. Usually if an urban district and a rural district share the code, the number of the following letters is different. For example, the urban district (Straubing) SR has one letter after the code (SR - A 123). The surrounding district Straubing-Bogen has two letters (SR - AB 123) after the code. It depends on the number of registered automobiles (or citizens) whether the City or the district has two letters, because there are more possibilities with two letters, so the part with more citizens usually has two letters. For example, the urban district Regensburg has more citizens than the rural district Regensburg, so the city has two letters after the code R.\nThe number of letters in the city/region code usually shows the size and location of the district: the largest German cities generally only have one letter codes (B=Berlin, M=M\u00fcnchen (Munich), K=K\u00f6ln (Cologne), F=Frankfurt am Main), most other districts in Germany have two or three letter codes. Districts in eastern Germany usually have more letters, for two reasons:\nThis is only a rule of thumb, there are a number of exceptions e.g. Germany's second largest city Hamburg (HH, Hansestadt Hamburg, because of its historical membership in the Hanseatic League) or the west German district Ammerland (WST, Westerstede is the capital of the district).\nThe reason for this scheme is however not to display size or location, but simply to have enough combinations available within the maximum length of eight characters per plate.\nAfter the location name there are the emission test and vehicle safety test stickers (see below), followed by one or two letters and one to four numbers. These letters and numbers can be chosen by the vehicle owner or if they prefer, random ones can be allocated by the licensing office. The total quantity of letters and numbers on the plate is never higher than eight. One letter with low numbers are normally reserved for motorcycle use since the plate space of these vehicles is smaller.\nProhibited combinations.\nVarious combinations that could be considered politically unacceptable\u2014mainly due to implications relating to Nazi Germany\u2014are disallowed or otherwise avoided. The district S\u00e4chsische Schweiz uses the name of its main town, Pirna, in its code \"PIR\", to avoid the use of \"SS\", the name of the nazi group; similarly \"SA\" is also unused. This is why automobiles for the government and parliament in Saxony-Anhalt are registered with LSA (Land Sachsen Anhalt). In 2004 in Nuremberg, an automobile owner was refused a number plate beginning N-PD because of the connection to the political party, the NPD. \nBanned combinations include the Nazi abbreviations HJ (\"Hitlerjugend\", Hitler Youth), NS (\"Nationalsozialismus\", National Socialism), SA (\"Sturmabteilung\"), SS (\"Schutzstaffel\") and KZ (\"Konzentrationslager\", concentration camp). Some registration offices have overlooked this rule by mistake, however; there are a few automobiles registered carrying prohibited codes, such as \"B-SS 12\". Some counties also allow these combinations if they are the initials of the owner (e.g., Norbert Schmidt might be able to get XX-NS 1234), but in this case, if the automobile is sold and re-registered in the same county by the new owner, the number can be changed (otherwise the number stays with the automobile until it registered in a different area).\nSpecial codes.\nCertain types of vehicle bear special codes:\nThe German Federal President's license plate is 0-1, the Chancellor's 0-2, the Foreign Secretary's 0-3. The plate of the President of the Bundestag is an exception: it shows 1-1. This is to show that the Bundestag's President is not part of the government but still ranks higher in importance than the Chancellor. These vehicles are tax-exempt and need not to be insured since the German government acts as insurer."}

It brings low temperatures, strong winds, and a lot of blowing snow. Blizzards start when a high pressure system touches a low pressure system. The word \"blizzard\" is sometimes used incorrectly by news media to talk about big winter storms, even if the storm is not a blizzard.\nGeography.\nSome areas are more likely to be hit by blizzards than others, but a blizzard can occur in any place where snow falls. In North America, blizzards happen often in the northern-east states, and in the provinces of Canada. In this region, blizzards can happen more than twice each winter. They also occur often in the mountain ranges of western North America. Because these regions have low populations, blizzards sometimes are not reported.\nWhiteouts.\nA very dangerous type of blizzard is a whiteout. In a whiteout, downdrafts and snowfall are so thick that people cannot tell the ground and sky apart. People caught in a whiteout lose their sense of direction very fast. This is a large danger to pilots when they are flying airplanes, because they cannot tell how close they are to the ground, and may crash.\nWho cleans up after blizzards?\nThe community cleans up after a snowstorm/blizzard occurs. Blizzards only usually go for 3 hours so everything won't be too damaged, meaning it won't be as hard as an earthquake or tsunami to clean.\nHow deep the snow gets.\nThese horrible blizzards can achieve up to - deep. A basketball hoop is high, so a blizzard can get snow as deep as the height of two or three hoops.\nHow do blizzards occur?\nFirstly you need cold enough air to cause snow to fall in the clouds and ground level water and moisture is needed to form clouds and precipitation. The moisture is called water vapour to make the clouds a source of water vapour is cold air blowing across large lakes or the sea but the cold air doesn't actually make too much snow, its a combination of cold and warm air that does it. The warm air normally meets the cold air if the wind is being pulled towards the equator when they are brought together a front is formed and precipitation is formed and the warm air can go up to the clouds and the blizzard forms from there.\u00a0\nHow strong are a blizzard's winds?\nThere is sustained wind or\u00a0frequent gusts of per hour or greater.\nHow cold can blizzards get?\nBlizzards can get down to -12 degrees or lower. This makes it fairly easy to get hypothermia in a blizzard. Mostly freezing electrics and machinery making life very hard in the Hypothermic temperatures.\nFamous U.S. blizzards.\nThe Great Blizzard of 1888 was very damaging for the Northeastern United States. In that blizzard, 400 people died, 200 ships sunk, and snowdrifts were 10 or 15 feet high. In the Great Plains, states were hit by the Schoolhouse Blizzard that trapped children in schools and killed 235 people. \nIn 1880\u20131881 there was a winter that people in the Dakotas called the \"Hard Winter\". The author Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote her book \"The Long Winter\" about that winter's story. It talks about one blizzard after another, and how it changed Laura's family and everybody around her. The book is almost all true. Her story of two men from the town of DeSmet, South Dakota, going after some wheat stored some miles south of DeSmet in February 1881 is true, and Ingalls later married one of the men, Almanzo Wilder. If the two men had not found and brought back the wheat, the people would have starved. The snow and ice thawed in April, and the railroads could start again. The train picture above was photographed on March 29, 1881, not far from DeSmet.\n34 people died during a 3-day spring blizzard on March 1920 in North Dakota. One of the people who died was Hazel Miner, a teenage girl who died of freezing to death when she got lost on her way home from her one-room-school.\nThe Armistice Day Blizzard in 1940 surprised many people with how fast the temperature dropped. It was in the morning, but by noon, it was snowing. Some of the people froze to death in the snow. 154 people died in the Armistice Day Blizzard. \n105 years after the Great Blizzard of 1888, a giant blizzard, named the Storm of the Century, hit the U.S in 1993. It dropped snow on 26 states and reached as far north as Canada and as far south as Mexico. In many southern U.S. areas, such as parts of Alabama, more snow fell in this storm than ever fell in an entire winter. Highways and airports closed across the U.S. The blizzard also made 15 tornadoes in Florida. When the storm was over, 270 people died and 48 were reported missing."}

He was the greatest English composer of church music of his day. He lived at a time when the standard of music in England had become very bad. He did a lot to improve it, especially church music. He had a hard life earning enough money. This was largely his own fault: he was a difficult man with a bad temper and often argued with his employers. \nLife.\nEarly years.\nHe was born in London, the illegitimate son of the composer Samuel Wesley and his partner Sarah Suter. He was given the name of his father (Samuel) and the name Sebastian after the composer Johann Sebastian Bach. \nAs a boy he sang in the choir of the Chapel Royal. The Chapel Royal was not nearly as good as it had been in the 16th and 17th centuries when it had been associated with many famous composers. When choirboys made mistakes the music teacher William Hawes would hit them with a riding whip. Samuel Sebastian was an excellent choirboy, and he and another boy were sent to Brighton to sing to King George IV who had gone there for his holiday. He also sang at St. Paul's Cathedral.\nCareer.\nHereford.\nWhen he was a young man he played the organ in several churches in London and started to compose. He wrote some music for melodramas in theatres. When he was 22 he became organist of Hereford Cathedral. This changed his life, because his career now focussed on church music. The choir at Hereford was not very good. The organ was broken, and his lodgings were not nice. However, he was able to perform in the Three Choirs Festival and he composed some church music, including the popular anthem \"Blessed be the God and Father\", written for an Easter Day service when the choir only had boys and one male singer. He married the sister of the dean of the cathedral. Her family did not approve and did not go to the wedding.\nExeter.\nIn 1835 he moved to Exeter Cathedral. He improved the choir there and persuaded the authorities to renovate the organ. He had a good salary there, but soon got fed up because he argued with his employers. He often went fishing instead of going to work, sending one of his choir boys to play the organ instead. One day, when Wesley was supposed to play \u201cGod Save the King\u201d he played \u201cRule Britannia\u201d. This sort of behaviour did not do his reputation much good. He wanted to get a doctorate degree from Oxford University so he wrote an anthem \"O Lord thou art my God\". The professor at Oxford, William Crotch, wanted him to make some changes in the music, but he refused. In the end he was given the degree anyway. \nLeeds.\nThe next job he had was at Leeds Parish Church. This was the only job he had in his life which was not at a cathedral, but his choir at Leeds was probably better than any of the cathedral choirs he had. The services there were very good, and he improved the choir singing. Leeds was not a nice town in those days. It was very badly polluted through industry. Wesley earned extra money by giving music lessons. He was also in demand for giving organ recitals in different churches. He gave the choir more modern music to sing, including his own compositions. He wrote an introduction to a book of psalm tunes in which he criticized the state of the church in England. He did it in a very personal way and it made his employers angry.\nOne day he went fishing when he should have been at choir practice. He fell when climbing over a stile and broke his leg. After that he always walked with a limp. While he was in hospital he wrote an anthem \"Cast me not away\" to words from Psalm 51. When the music gets to the words \u201cthe bones which thou hast broken\u201d he set them to strange, crunching chords.\nIn spite of his awkward behaviour the people in Leeds were sorry when he left. He conducted a performance of the \"Messiah\" and he was given a portrait of himself.\nWinchester.\nHe went to Winchester Cathedral. At first he got on very well with the clergy. He performed and composed new music. He spent a lot of time collecting and publishing all the anthems he had written. He composed hymn tunes. He persuaded his employers to spend money on improving the organ.\nAlthough he was being paid a good salary (\u00a380 a year) Wesley did less and less work. He performed less and left a lot of the playing to his pupils so that he could go fishing and sailing. He did not like the new precentor who was appointed in 1858. \nIn 1863 he composed an anthem \"Give the King thy Judgement\" for the marriage of the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII and Princess Alexandra of Denmark). He did not like Winchester. He said there were no other good musicians to talk to.\nGloucester.\nWhen the job of organist at Gloucester Cathedral became available he took it and left Winchester very quicky. Once again he found himself in a cathedral with a bad choir and an organ in a bad state of repair, but this time he seemed to make little effort to do anything about it. He spent a lot of time editing other people\u2019s music. Once more, after a gap of 30 years, he was able to perform in the Three Choirs Festival. He conducted the music of Louis Spohr, his father Samuel Wesley and also some music by the young Hubert Parry who was not yet well-known. When he conducted he often did not think about what he was doing and got muddled. In 1871 he conducted Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion, the first time it had been performed in England outside London. \nHe was offered a knighthood but chose to be given money instead. He started to become ill. He had a kidney disease. The last time he played the organ was at Christmas in 1875. He died on 19th April 1876 and was buried next to his daughter in Devon. There was no music at all at his funeral.\nHis music.\nWesley is remembered for his music composed for the Church of England. He wrote many anthems, including \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace\", \"Blessed be the God and Father\", \"The Wilderness\" and \"Ascribe unto the Lord\". The last two of these are verse anthems (anthem which contrast sections for the full choir with sections for a few soloists). The popular short anthem \"Lead me Lord\" is part of \"Praise the Lord, O my soul\".\nHe wrote a number of organ works. One of his most charming pieces is \"Holsworthy Church Bells\" (1874). He also wrote chamber and orchestral music.\nHis influence.\nWesley had an important influence on organ building. He went to the Great Exhibition in 1851 and saw organs with pedals that, instead of being exactly parallel, spread out at the top like a fan. He liked these radiating pedal boards and persuaded the great organ builder Henry Willis to put pedal boards like that in the organs he built. \nSamuel Sebastian Wesley was a very famous performer and throughout his life he was often asked to play the first concerts on new organs (\u201cinaugural concerts\u201d). His music is still very popular today, and some of his short anthems are not too difficult for the average church choir to sing."}

{"id": "91105", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91105", "title": "La boh\u00e8me", "text": "La boh\u00e8me (pronounced, \"La bo-EM\") is an Italian opera in four acts. The music was written by Giacomo Puccini. The libretto was written by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa.\nThe opera tells the story of a love affair between a poor poet and an equally poor seamstress in 19th century Paris. The opera is based on a book by Henri Murger called \"Scenes from Bohemian Life\" (). \nArturo Toscanini conducted the first performance of \"La boh\u00e8me\" on February 1, 1896 at the Teatro Regio in Turin, Italy. The opera was adapted to a movie in 1965 and the 1996 Broadway musical, \"Rent\".\nHenri Murger.\nHenri Murger was born in 1822 to an immigrant German tailor in Paris. He worked as a secretary until 1841 when he became a journalist and joined the poor artists and writers who called themselves Bohemians.\nFrom 1845 to 1848, Murger's stories about Bohemian life in Paris were serialized (published in parts) in a French magazine. The book brought Murger little income. Playwright Th\u00e9odore Barri\u00e8re suggested making a play of the book, and Murger accepted. The play appeared in 1849. It was a success.\nAlmost every chapter of Murger's book mentions an incident or event which found its way into Puccini's opera. However, the love affair between the poet and the seamstress appears only as a little tale in the book about a sculptor named Jacques and a seamstress named Francine.\nAfter the publication of the play, adaptations appeared. In 1877, an operetta was staged in Paris. In 1897, an opera by Ruggero Leoncavallo was staged in Venice. Another play based on the book was performed in New York in 1896. The first movie was released in 1916, and other movies were released in the following years.\nDevelopment.\nPuccini wrote most of \"La boh\u00e8me\" at Torre del Lago, a village in Tuscany he had just made his home. Most decisions about the opera were made through letters sent back and forth between Ricordi (Puccini's publisher), the two librettists, and the composer. This arrangement was not the best for getting the work done in a timely manner.\nPuccini began toying with the idea of writing another work called \"La lupa\" (\"The She-Wolf\"). The librettists were furious. Puccini was dividing his time between two projects while taking them to task for their slowness on the present one. Giacosa complained that he used more paper and time on \"La boh\u00e9me\" that he had on any of his other dramas.\nWhole scenes were rewritten, revised, and even discarded before going through the cycle again. Despite the turmoil, Puccini was considering the David Belasco play \"Tosca\" as yet another project. He briefly interrupted work on \"La boh\u00e8me\" to travel to Florence to see Sarah Bernhardt perform the play.\nPuccini and Ruggero Leoncavallo (composer of the 1892 opera \"I pagliacci\") both chose to set M\u00fcrger's book to music. Each claimed he was the first to make this decision. Leoncavallo's \"La Boh\u00e8me\" was first performed in 1897, the year after Puccini's opera. Leoncavallo's opera never attained the fame that Puccini's did probably because Puccini's opera was gaining a popularity in 1897 that left Leoncavallo's opera in the dust.\nPerformances.\n\"La boh\u00e8me\" was first performed in Turin, Italy on February 1, 1896 at the Teatro Regio. It was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. In 1946, Toscanini conducted a radio performance that was released to LP records and later compact discs. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.\nWithin a few years, the opera was performed in theatres throughout Italy including La Scala and La Fenice. The first performance outside of Italy was in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1896. Other performances followed in the next ten years around the world.\nThe first performance in United Kingdom took place in Manchester, on 22 April 1897. It was performed by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in English and was supervised by Puccini. On 2 October 1897 the same company gave the opera's first staging at the Royal Opera House in London.\nThe opera was first performed in the United States by the Carl Rosa Opera Company on October 14, 1897 in Los Angeles, California. It was performed in New York City at Palmo's Opera House on May 16, 1898. The Metropolitan Opera House staged the opera for the first time on December 26, 1900.\nStory of the opera.\nAct 1.\n\"In the four bohemians' attic room\"\nAct 1 takes place in Paris around 1830. A group of bohemians live in a room in an attic. Marcello is painting while Rodolfo gazes out of the window. They are so poor and so cold that they burn a drama that Rodolfo has written. Colline, the philosopher, comes in shivering and cross because he had not been able to pawn some books. Schaunard, the musician of the group, arrives with food, firewood, wine, cigars, and money. He tells his friends that he has got these things because he has a job with an English gentleman. The others hardly listen as they are so hungry that they try to eat the food. Schaunard interrupts them, taking the meal away, and saying that they will all celebrate his luck by having dinner at Cafe Momus instead.\nWhile they drink the wine, Benoit, the landlord, arrives to collect the rent. The group gives him lots of wine so that he becomes drunk and starts to tell the people his adventures about love. Eventually, the group throws him out. The money that should have been used to pay the rent is divided among them so they can have a good time.\nThe other Bohemians go out, but Rodolfo stays alone for a moment in order to finish a newspaper article, promising to join his friends soon. There is a knock at the door, and Mimi, a seamstress who lives in a flat below, enters. Her candle has blown out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She thanks him, but returns a few seconds later, saying she has lost her key. Both candles go out. It is dark, and the couple try to feel their way about. Rodolfo wants to spend time with Mimi. He finds the key, but puts it in his pocket and does not tell her. In two famous arias (Rodolfo's \"Che gelida manina\" \u2014 \"What a cold little hand,\" and Mimi's \"S\u00ec, mi chiamano Mim\u00ec\" \u2014 \"Yes, they call me Mimi\"), they tell each other about their backgrounds. Rodolfo\u2019s friends call for him to come out and join them. He would prefer to stay there with Mimi but she decides they should go together. They go out, singing about their love for one another.\nAct 2.\n\"Latin Quarter on Christmas Eve\"\nThe streets are crowded with happy people. Rodolfo buys Mimi a bonnet. The friends go into a caf\u00e9. Musetta, who used to be Marcello's sweetheart, comes into the cafe with Alcindoro, a rich old man. She is tired of him. She sings a naughty song, hoping Marcello will notice her.\nMarcello becomes mad with jealousy. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to have a tight shoe and sends him with it to the shoemaker. Musetta and Marcello fall into each other's arms.\nThe sound of a military parade is heard. Marcello and Colline carry Musetta out on their shoulders while everyone claps. Alcindoro returns with the repaired shoe. The waiter hands him the bill. He is surprised by how much he has to pay, and sinks into a chair.\nAct 3.\n\"At a toll gate a month or two later\"\nMim\u00ec passes through the toll gate. She is coughing. She finds Marcello, who lives in a little tavern near the gate. She tells him of her hard life with Rodolfo, who has left her that night.\nRodolfo comes out of the tavern looking for Marcello. Mim\u00ec hides. She hears Rodolfo telling Marcello why he left her. At first he says Mim\u00ec does not love him, but then he says he left her because she is dying of an illness.\nRodolfo is poor and can do little to help Mim\u00ec. He hopes that a rich man may fall in love with her and pay for her to have medical treatment. Out of kindness towards Mim\u00ec, Marcello tries to stop Rodolfo, but she has already heard everything.\nShe coughs, and Rodolfo discovers her. They sing of their lost love, and agree that although they should separate, they love one another and agree to stay together until the spring. Marcello and Musetta are heard quarrelling in the background.\nAct 4.\n\"The attic room\"\nMarcello and Rodolfo are both sad at losing their loved ones. Schaunard and Colline arrive with a tiny bit of food. They pretend they are having a big feast, and they all dance. Musetta arrives with news: Mimi, who had found a rich gentleman, has now left him and is wandering in the streets feeling very ill and weak.\nMusetta has brought Mimi back with her to the attic room. Mimi is helped into a chair. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat. Schaunard leaves quietly to give Mimi and Rodolfo time together. Left alone, the two remember their past happiness.\nThey remember their first meeting. Rodolfo gives Mimi the pink bonnet he bought her, which he has kept as a souvenir of their love. The others return, with a gift of a muff to warm Mimi's hands and some medicine, and tell Rodolfo that a doctor has been called, but it is too late. As Musetta prays, Mimi dies. Rodolfo collapses in tears.\nOrchestra.\n\"La boh\u00e8me\" is scored for the standard orchestra of the period:\nMovies.\nIn 1965, a West German movie version of the opera was released. It was filmed on location in Milan and Munich. The movie was produced by conductor Herbert von Karajan and designed by Franco Ziffirelli. It starred Mirella Freni as Mimi, Adriana Martino as Musetta, Gianni Raimondi as Rudolpho, and Rolando Panerai as Marcello. The movie won the 1966 National Board of Review for Top Foreign Film."}

He was born to William Hooker and Minnie Ramsey and was the youngest of eleven children. He and his siblings were home-schooled and they were only allowed to listen to religious songs. His parents separated in 1921 and his mother married William Moore, a blues singer the next year. Moore introduced Hooker to the guitar. John would later credit Moore for his distinctive playing style.\nLater life.\nAll through the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis where he worked on Beale Street and sometimes performed at house parties. In 1948, he started working at Ford Motor Company.\nCareer.\nHooker's early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. John Lee Hooker rarely played on a standard beat, changing tempos to fit the songs. This made it nearly impossible to add backing tracks. \nPop culture.\nHooker appeared and sang in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\". He recorded over 100 albums.\nIn 1989, he played with Keith Richards, Carlos Santana and Bonnie Raitt to record \"The Healer\" and won a Grammy Award. Hooker recorded lots of songs with Van Morrison, including \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\", \"The Healing Game\" and \"I Cover the Waterfront\".\nDeath.\nHe fell ill just before a tour of Europe in 2001 and died soon afterwards at the age of 83.

Sewing machines were an invention of the industrial revolution that made it possible to sew faster than people could sew by hand. Some sewing machines are also used for embroidery. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790,\u00a0the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry.\nHome sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type. In a modern sewing machine the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles and\u00a0thimbles\u00a0and other such tools used in hand sewing, automating the process of stitching and saving time.\nIndustrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task.\nHistory.\nInvention.\nCharles Fredrick Wiesenthal, a German-born engineer working in\u00a0England\u00a0was awarded the first British patent for a mechanical device to aid the art of sewing, in 1755. His invention consisted of a double pointed needle with an eye at one end.\nIn 1790, the English inventor Thomas Saint invented the first sewing machine design, but he did not successfully advertise or market his invention.\u00a0His machine was meant to be used on\u00a0leather\u00a0and\u00a0canvas\u00a0material. It is likely that Saint had a working model but there is no evidence of one; he was a skilled\u00a0cabinet maker\u00a0and his device included many practically functional features: an overhanging arm, a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather), a vertical needle bar, and a looper.\nHis sewing machine used the\u00a0chain stitch\u00a0method, in which the machine uses a single thread to make simple stitches in the fabric. A\u00a0stitching awl\u00a0would pierce the material and a forked point rod would carry the thread through the hole where it would be hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, where the cycle would be repeated, locking the stitch.\u00a0Saint's machine was designed to aid the manufacture of various leather goods, including\u00a0saddles\u00a0and\u00a0bridles, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing\u00a0ship sails. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it could become a practical proposition. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint's drawings in the\u00a0London Patent Office, made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the\u00a0London Science Museum.\nIn 1804, a sewing machine was built by the Englishmen Thomas Stone and James Henderson, and a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan in Scotland.\u00a0An Austrian tailor,\u00a0Josef Madersperger, began developing his first sewing machine in 1807. He presented his first working machine in 1814.\nThe first practical and widely used sewing machine was invented by\u00a0Barth\u00e9lemy Thimonnier, a French tailor, in 1829. His machine sewed straight seams using\u00a0chain stitch\u00a0like Saint's model, and in 1830, he signed a contract with Auguste Ferrand, a\u00a0mining engineer, who made the requisite drawings and submitted a patent application. The\u00a0patent\u00a0for his machine was issued on 17 July 1830, and in the same year, he opened (with partners) the first machine-based clothing manufacturing company in the world to create army uniforms for the\u00a0French Army. However, the\u00a0factory\u00a0was burned down, reportedly by workers fearful of losing their livelihood following the issuing of the patent.\nA model of the machine is exhibited at the\u00a0London Science Museum. The machine is made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop. The first American\u00a0lockstitch\u00a0sewing machine was invented by\u00a0Walter Hunt\u00a0in 1832.\u00a0His machine used an eye-pointed needle (with the eye and the point on the same end) carrying the upper thread and a falling shuttle carrying the lower thread. The curved needle moved through the fabric horizontally, leaving the loop as it withdrew. The shuttle passed through the loop, interlocking the thread. The feed let the machine down, requiring the machine to be stopped frequently and reset up. Hunt eventually lost interest in his machine and sold individual machines without bothering to patent his invention, and only patenting it at a late date of 1854. In 1842, John Greenough patented the first sewing machine in the United States. The British partners Newton and Archibold introduced the eye-pointed needle and the use of two pressing surfaces to keep the pieces of fabric in position, in 1841.\nThe first machine to combine all the disparate elements of the previous half-century of innovation into the modern sewing machine was the device built by English inventor John Fisher in 1844, thus a little earlier than the very similar machines built by the infamous\u00a0Isaac Merritt Singer\u00a0in 1851, and the lesser known\u00a0Elias Howe, in 1845. However, due to the botched filing of Fisher's patent at the Patent Office, he did not receive due recognition for the modern sewing machine in the legal disputations of priority with Singer, and it was Singer who won the benefits of the patent.\nElias Howe, born in Spencer, Massachusetts, created his sewing machine in 1845, using a similar method to Fisher's except that the fabric was held vertically. An important improvement on his machine was to have the needle running away from the point, starting from the eye.\u00a0After a lengthy stay in England trying to attract interest in his machine, he returned to America to find various people infringing his patent, among them\u00a0Isaac Merritt Singer.\u00a0He eventually won a case for patent infringement in 1854, and was awarded the right to claim royalties from the manufacturers using ideas covered by his patent, including Singer.\nSinger had seen a rotary sewing machine being repaired in a Boston shop. As an engineer, he thought it was clumsy and decided to design a better one. The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a presser foot to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic tension system. This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe's machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851, and it was suggested[\"]\u00a0he patent the foot pedal or\u00a0treadle, used to power some of his machines; unfortunately, the foot pedal had been in use too long for a patent to be issued. When Howe learned of Singer's machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a\u00a0lump sum\u00a0for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe's patent and paid him $1.15 per machine before entering into a\u00a0joint partnership\u00a0with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first\u00a0hire-purchase\u00a0arrangement to allow people to buy their machines through payments over time.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Allen B. Wilson\u00a0developed a shuttle that\u00a0reciprocated\u00a0in a short arc, which was an improvement over Singer and Howe's. However, John Bradshaw had patented a similar device and threatened to sue, so Wilson decided to try a new method. He went into partnership with\u00a0Nathaniel Wheeler\u00a0to produce a machine with a\u00a0rotary hook\u00a0instead of a shuttle. This was far quieter and smoother than other methods, with the result that the\u00a0Wheeler &amp; Wilson\u00a0Company produced more machines in the 1850s and 1860s than any other manufacturer. Wilson also invented the four-motion feed mechanism that is still seen on every sewing machine today. This had a forward, down, back and up motion, which drew the cloth through in an even and smooth motion. Charles Miller patented the first machine to stitch\u00a0buttonholes.\u00a0Throughout the 1850s more and more companies were being formed, each trying to sue the others for patent infringement. This triggered a\u00a0patent thicket\u00a0known as the Sewing Machine War.\nIn 1856, the\u00a0Sewing Machine Combination\u00a0was formed, consisting of Singer, Howe, Wheeler, Wilson, Grover and Baker. These four companies pooled their patents, with the result that all other manufacturers had to obtain a license and pay $15 per machine. This lasted until 1877, when the last patent expired.\u00a0James Edward Allen Gibbs\u00a0(1829\u20131902), a farmer from Raphine in Rockbridge County, Virginia patented the first\u00a0chain stitch\u00a0single-thread sewing machine on June 2, 1857. In partnership with James Willcox, Gibbs became a principal partner in Willcox &amp; Gibbs Sewing Machine Company.\nWillcox &amp; Gibbs commercial sewing machines are still used in the 21st century.\nElias Howe, born in Spencer, Massachusetts, created his sewing machine in 1845, using a similar method to Fisher's except that the fabric was held vertically. An important improvement on his machine was to have the needle running away from the point, starting from the eye.\u00a0After a lengthy stay in England trying to attract interest in his machine, he returned to America to find various people infringing his patent, among them\u00a0Isaac Merritt Singer.\u00a0He eventually won a case for patent infringement in 1854, and was awarded the right to claim royalties from the manufacturers using ideas covered by his patent, including Singer.\nSinger had seen a rotary sewing machine being repaired in a Boston shop.

The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a presser foot to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic tension system. This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe's machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851, and it was suggested[\"]\u00a0he patent the foot pedal or\u00a0treadle, used to power some of his machines; unfortunately, the foot pedal had been in use too long for a patent to be issued. When Howe learned of Singer's machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a\u00a0lump sum\u00a0for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe's patent and paid him $1.15 per machine before entering into a\u00a0joint partnership\u00a0with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first\u00a0hire-purchase\u00a0arrangement to allow people to buy their machines through payments over time.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Allen B. Wilson\u00a0developed a shuttle that\u00a0reciprocated\u00a0in a short arc, which was an improvement over Singer and Howe's. However, John Bradshaw had patented a similar device and threatened to sue, so Wilson decided to try a new method. He went into partnership with\u00a0Nathaniel Wheeler\u00a0to produce a machine with a\u00a0rotary hook\u00a0instead of a shuttle. This was far quieter and smoother than other methods, with the result that the\u00a0Wheeler &amp; Wilson\u00a0Company produced more machines in the 1850s and 1860s than any other manufacturer. Wilson also invented the four-motion feed mechanism that is still seen on every sewing machine today. This had a forward, down, back and up motion, which drew the cloth through in an even and smooth motion. Charles Miller patented the first machine to stitch\u00a0buttonholes.\u00a0Throughout the 1850s more and more companies were being formed, each trying to sue the others for patent infringement. This triggered a\u00a0patent thicket\u00a0known as the Sewing Machine War.\nIn 1856, the\u00a0Sewing Machine Combination\u00a0was formed, consisting of Singer, Howe, Wheeler, Wilson, Grover and Baker. These four companies pooled their patents, with the result that all other manufacturers had to obtain a license and pay $15 per machine. This lasted until 1877, when the last patent expired.\u00a0James Edward Allen Gibbs\u00a0(1829\u20131902), a farmer from Raphine in Rockbridge County, Virginia patented the first\u00a0chain stitch\u00a0single-thread sewing machine on June 2, 1857. In partnership with James Willcox, Gibbs became a principal partner in Willcox &amp; Gibbs Sewing Machine Company.\nWillcox &amp; Gibbs commercial sewing machines are still used in the 21st century.\nClothing manufacturers were the first sewing machine customers, and used them to produce the first\u00a0ready-to-wear\u00a0clothing and shoes. In the 1860s consumers began purchasing them, and the machines\u2014ranging in price from \u00a36 to \u00a315 in Britain depending on features\u2014became very common in middle-class homes. Owners were much more likely to spend free time with their machines to make and mend clothing for their families than to visit friends, and\u00a0women's magazines\u00a0and household guides such as\u00a0\"Mrs Beeton's\"\u00a0offered\u00a0dress patterns\u00a0and instructions. A sewing machine could produce a man's shirt in about one hour, compared to 14 1/2 hours by hand.\nIn 1877 the world's first\u00a0crochet\u00a0machine was invented and patented by\u00a0Joseph M. Merrow, then-president of what had started in the 1840s as a machine shop to develop specialized machinery for the knitting operations. This crochet machine was the first production\u00a0overlock\u00a0sewing machine. The\u00a0Merrow Machine Company\u00a0went on to become one of the largest American Manufacturers of\u00a0overlock\u00a0sewing machines, and continues to be a global presence in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.\nIn 1885 Singer patented the\u00a0Singer Vibrating Shuttle\u00a0sewing machine, which used Allen B. Wilson's idea for a vibrating shuttle and was a better lockstitcher than the oscillating shuttles of the time. Millions of the machines, perhaps the world's first really practical sewing machine for domestic use, were produced until finally superseded by rotary shuttle machines in the 20th century. Sewing machines continued being made to roughly the same design, with more lavish decoration appearing until well into the 1900s.\nThe first electric machines were developed by\u00a0Singer Sewing Co.\u00a0and introduced in 1889.\u00a0By the end of the\u00a0First World War, Singer was offering hand, treadle and electric machines for sale. At first the electric machines were standard machines with a motor strapped on the side, but as more homes gained power, they became more popular and the motor was gradually introduced into the casing.\nTypes of sewing machines.\nThere are four main types of sewing machines:"}

The war lasted 116 years and started because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without an immediate male heir (a son or a younger brother). Edward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France through his mother.\nSince the French did not want a foreign king, Philip VI of France said that he was king because the Salic law prevented French women from ruling or transmitting the right to rule to their sons. The two countries went to war because the English did not have that rule.\nWhen the war started, France was stronger than England as it was wealthier, and French knights and heavy cavalry also enjoyed a great military reputation in all of Christendom. Also, France had about 17 million people, but England had only about 4 million people. However, France was a decentralised feudal monarchy in the middle ages and so was it was less unified than England. France had an alliance with Scotland and Bohemia, and England was supported by parts of the Low Countries and by some regions in France loyal to the Plantagenet kings of England.\nThe English won a major victory at sea in the Battle of Sluys in 1340, which prevented France from invading England. Most of the rest of the war was fought in France. England then won an overwhelming victory at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in 1346 against all odds. the use of the English longbow and stakes to counter the French cavalry played a decisive role in that victory.\nFrom 1348 to 1356, there was very little fighting because the Black Death killed many people in England and even many more people in France. Edward, the Black Prince, then won a brilliant victory at the Battle of Poitiers for England. King John II of France was captured during the battle. The English invaded France again but were not able to take any more cities. A truce in 1360 gave England about one quarter of France. This first part of the Hundred Years' War is called the Edwardian War.\nThe war started again in 1369. The new king Charles V of France was more successful, with Bertrand du Guesclin as his best knight. France allied with Castile against England and Portugal, and some of the fighting spilled into Spain and Portugal. France won back most of the land that had been given to the English, and Bertrand du Guesclin won great French victories at the battles of Cocherel and Pontvallain. A peace followed from 1389 to 1415. The second part of the war is called the Caroline War.\nHenry V.\nThe most famous part of the war began in 1415. Henry V of England invaded France and won the infamous Battle of Agincourt, again because of his great longbowmen. Much of the French nobility is said to have been killed in the battle. King Charles VI of France was insane and unable to rule, and nearly all his sons died young.\nThe queen of France, Isabeau of Bavaria, married one of her daughters to Henry V and signed the Treaty of Troyes to make Henry V the next king of France. Both Henry V and Charles VI died around the same time in 1422. The English believed that his son Henry VI of England was now the rightful king of France, and many French people agreed.\nCharles VI's last son, Charles VII of France, said that he ought to be the new king, but many French people said he did not deserve to be king because they thought he was a bastard.\nThe English continued to capture land in France and formed an alliance with Burgundy. They won another major victory at the Battle of Verneuil, but in 1429, Joan of Arc led the French army to success at the Siege of Orleans. At the Battle of Patay the same year, French knights, led by La Hire, won a great victory, and the heavy cavalry killed most of the veteran English longbowmen. Joan regained many cities in northeastern France and brought Charles VII to his coronation, but she did not recover Paris.\nShe was captured by the Burgundians in 1430, convicted of heresy and burned at the stake in 1431. After her death, the French continued to take back their territory piece by piece. France won diplomatically in 1435 with the Treaty of Arras. That made Burgundy stop being England's ally and make peace with France. In 1450, France won another great victory at the Battle of Formigny and reconquered Normandy.\nThe war ended in 1453 with a crushing victory of the French at the Battle of Castillon in which nearly 300 cannons, made by Jean Bureau and his brother Gaspard, were used for the first time in a battle. This third and last part of the war is called the Lancastrian War."}

There are 4,000 species. About 30 species invade human homes. This is less than 1% of all the cockroach species. Four species are pests. \nEvolutionary history and relationships.\nThe families of Mantodea, Isoptera, and Blattaria are usually combined by entomologists into a larger group called Dictyoptera. Current evidence strongly suggests that termites have evolved directly from true cockroaches, and many authors now consider termites to be in the family of cockroaches.\nHistorically, the name Blattaria has been used largely interchangeably with the name Blattodea. Blattodea refers to a larger group that includes fossil groups related to roaches, but not true cockroaches themselves. These earliest cockroach-like fossils (\"Blattopterans\" or \"roachids\") are from the Carboniferous period between 354\u2013295 million years ago. However, these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantis as well as modern cockroaches. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appear in the Lower Cretaceous.\nA proposed phylogeny of the families is shown in the diagram.\nCockroaches in the broader sense (Blattodea) have existed a very long time. The earliest cockroach fossils are 354\u2013295 million years old. Science student, Cary Easterday, found a giant 300 million year old fossil cockroach long, in a coal mine in Ohio.\nOther.\nMost cockroaches are omnivores. They are tough, and hard to kill. A cockroach can live for two weeks without a head.\nCockroaches become adults in 3-4 months and can live up to one year. A female German cockroach can produce 8 egg cases in her lifetime and each egg case may contain 30-40 eggs.\nCockroaches are eaten as snacks and used for medicine in China.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1996 MTV musical movie \"Joe's Apartment\" had 5,000 singing cockroaches. Some parts of the movie were made with clay roaches and some with real roaches.\nIn the 1996 computer game \"Bad Mojo\", the main character is turned into a cockroach and must move through a building to get back to his human body."}

Several organizations have stated that difficulties currently experienced by the Armenian minority in Turkey are a result of an anti-Armenian attitude by the Turkish government as well as by ultra-nationalist groups such as the Grey Wolves.\nModern anti-Armenianism often seems to lacks a racial and cultural basis and appears to be based more on geopolitics and history, in addition to diplomatic and strategic interests, involving the modern states of Turkey and Azerbaijan. The controversy and emotions surrounding the Armenian Genocide and Nagorno-Karabakh are two examples of intense anti-Armenianism in both countries. Modern Anti-Armenianism is usually associated with either extreme opposition to the actions or existence of the Armenian Republic, and belief in an Armenian conspiracy.\nAnti-Armenianism by individuals.\nFor several months in 1994, Ahmet Co\u015far going by the alias of Serdar Argic posted thousands of messages, claiming that the Armenian Genocide did not happen or that Armenians massacred Turks, on Usenet newsgroup threads mentioning the word Turkey. Samuel Weems published the book \"Armenia: The Secrets of a \"Christian\" Terrorist State\" where he has made such claims as the \"number one export of Armenia is terrorism\" and that there was no Armenian Genocide. American historian Justin McCarthy is known for his controversial support of Turkey's denial of the Armenian Genocide. Azeri cartoonist \"Kerim Kerimov Mammadhan\" has produced around 4500 Anti-Armenian cartoons, most of which depict crude caricatures of Armenians. His cartoons are often included with the phrase \u201cTerrorism, narkomania, and armenism are the same disease\u201d. His works also often mocks the Armenian Genocide and its recognition by foreign countries, especially countries in Europe. Murad Gumen is another individual who espouses anti-Armenian rhetoric in his website \"Tall Armenian Tale\". Barbaros Agri uses the social networking site Facebook to advocate anti-Armenianism by being the creator of \"The Biggest Lie Ever Told: The Armenian Genocide\". The cause has 5000 plus members."}

Jews and Armenians living in the city and their businesses were also targeted in the pogrom, which was, according to some circles, orchestrated by the Turkish government.\nA Turkish mob, most of which was trucked into the city in advance, assaulted Istanbul\u2019s Greek community for nine hours. Although the leaders of the pogrom did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, between 13 and 16 Greeks (including two Orthodox clerics) and at least one Armenian died during or after the pogrom as a result of beatings and arson.\nThirty-two Greeks were severely wounded. In addition, dozens of Greek women were raped, and a number of men were forcibly circumcised by the mob. 4,348 Greek-owned businesses, 110 hotels, 27 pharmacies, 23 schools, 21 factories, 73 churches and over a thousand Greek-owned homes were badly damaged or destroyed.\nEstimates of the economic cost of the damage vary from Turkish government's estimate of 24.8 million US$, the British diplomat estimates of 100 million GBP (about 200 million US$), the World Council of Churches\u2019 estimate of 150 million USD, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million US$.\nThe pogrom greatly accelerated emigration of ethnic Greeks from the Istanbul region, reducing the 200,000-strong Greek minority in 1924 to just 2,500 in 2006."}

She is played by Hannah Murray.\nPersonality.\nCassie is a very complicated character. She suffers from anorexia nervosa, self harm, and low self esteem. Her entire self worth is dependent on her weight, in one episode saying \"I didn't eat for three days... so I could be lovely.\" She also drinks alcohol and takes drugs. In the episode \"Tony\" she is seen sorting food, a common occurrence shown by people with anorexia. Despite Cassie's many \"problems\", she is a very gentle, caring,kind, and loving person. Written on her \"about me\" section of the \"Skins\" website, she talks about how much she loves her baby brother, Reuben. Cassie will even act positive to bad news so that she will not offend.\nCharacter history.\nSeries 1.\nCassie is released from a clinic, where she received treatment for her eating disorder. In the first episode, called \"Tony\", she stays with Sid and offers to have sex so he can lose his virginity, but she passes out before anything happens. In the second episode \"Cassie\", it is shown that she is not better and is still sick. She has also developed a crush on Sid. In \"Sid\", the fifth episode of the season, Cassie tries to kill herself after Sid cancels a date they planned, so that he could be with Michelle Richardson. In \"Michelle\", Michelle takes Sid to see Cassie, but Cassie is dating someone called Simon, a patient in the hospital she is currently in. In the last episode of the season, Cassie says she is moving to Scotland with her family, away from Bristol. Cassie writes Sid a letter and leaves it at his house after sneaking out the hospital. She is also given a letter Sid wrote to her from Tony Stonem. In the last moment of the season, Sid finds Cassie and they sit together and hold hands.\nSeries 2.\nCassie and Sid are in a serious romantic long distance relationship. In \"Sid\", the third episode, Sid thinks Cassie is cheating on him and becomes angry at her. Cassie is also angry, but because Sid does not trust her. At the end of the episode Cassie takes a train from where she lives in Scotland to Bristol, to visit Sid. She waits in his bedroom for him, but when Sid enters the bedroom he is kissing Michelle (not noticing that Cassie is also there). In \"Chris\", the fifth episode, Cassie bitterly tells her friends that Sid is together with Michelle. She copes with her feelings by having sex with almost anyone, doing drugs, and partying. In \"Effy\" Sid finally confronts Cassie and her bad behavior. The two get back together, but in \"Cassie\", it is clear that Cassie is still angry towards Michelle. After Cassie's roommate and friend Chris Miles dies, she runs away to New York City, where she is taken care of by a boy called Adam. In the finale \"Everyone\", in the last moment of the episode, Sid looks for Cassie in New York, and stops in front of the diner she works in."}

His music is similar to electronica and the minimalism of Steve Reich. Stevens says that he has plans to make a concept album for each of the 50 U.S. states. He began with \"Michigan\" (2003) and \"Illinois\" (2005).\nStevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in Petoskey. He went to Harbor Light Christian School as well as the Interlochen Arts Academy. He also learned at Hope College in Holland, Michigan.\nSufjan is an Arabic name that famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a man from early Islamic history. The name was given to Stevens by the person who founded Subud, a spiritual community. Stevens said in an interview, \"It sounds like Devendra Banhart kind of grew up in this strange kind of cultish environment, and I don't mean that word in a demeaning way. I think we probably come from similar backgrounds. There's a little bit of that in my history.\"\nStevens is a multi-instrumentalist, a person who can play many musical instruments. He is well known for his use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums by using multitrack recording. When he was in school, he learned the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums. He is one of the few musicians in pop music to use these instruments. A lot of instruments are played in unison to give his songs a \"symphony-like\" sound. Strings and horns are used very often in many of his songs.\nStevens lives in the Brooklyn part of New York City in the neighborhood Kensington where he makes up the Asthmatic Kitty Records staff of the Brooklyn office. His brother Marzuki Stevens is a marathon runner.\nThe song \"The Mystery of Love\" because of the \"movie Call Me by Your Name\" was hit song and won AMFT Awards in 2017\".\""}

While on tour for about two years, they had no new songs to perform. In January 2007 the band went into \"hibernation\" in a cabin (just outside the strip), as they began writing new songs for the next six months hoping for a second album to be released during fall 2007. On July 7, 2007 they played the song \"It's True Love\" live during their first performance since going into writing. Later that night however, the band decided that they did not like the music had written and scrapped all the songs they had written (which was about 3/4 of an album, as they were almost done recording).\nA month later Panic announced two newly written songs, the first named \"Middle of Summer\" (later changed to \"When the Day Met the Night\"), and \"Nine in the Afternoon\". In December, a part of \"Nine in the Afternoon\" was played on an episode of the television show \"Heroes\". Panic then began viral marketing, building puzzles on their official website. For about two weeks the puzzle gave snippets from an unknown song, along with the caption \"YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY...\". On January 1, 2008, the snippets finally were revealed to be part of a new song entitled \"We're So Starving\". A rough version of this song was then released for listening on their official MySpace page, but was later pulled with the release of \"Nine in the Afternoon\". A review from \"NME\" magazine was published on the internet with descriptions of each song. These reviews show the big different direction that Panic have taken with their new album.\nThe band announced the title of the new album, \"Pretty. Odd.\", through their website on January 9, and dropped the \"!\" from their band name at the same time. The band explained by saying \"We've just traded the exclamation point for a few periods.\" They announced the next day that they would be headlining the Honda Civic Tour in support of the album. The band then began a second puzzle on January 17, challenging fans to find puzzle pieces scattered throughout Panic-related websites, in order to reveal the album cover. The cover was officially revealed on January 22. Four days later, a new scavenger hunt was hidden on the official site, showing the tracklist of the album and offering a prize to the first three people who could find all 15 song titles for the new album. This was completed later that day.\nOn January 28 the winners were revealed. That very same day, the band posted the final version of \"Nine in the Afternoon\" on their MySpace page.

Urie sees a woman who seems to be unusually interested in him. They retreat to a private room. The two begin to kiss, and Urie removes his mask. The woman likewise removes her mask to reveal that she was in fact his wife. A quick slap to Urie's face and his wife turns to leave.

The lyrics in the bridge also directly satirize the lyrics of \"My Favorite Things\".\nThe song depicts the story of a virgin who, in desperate need of cash, agrees to sleep with a powerful Lawyer in exchange for a job at the firm. His wife, despite knowing about his late ventures, stays with him for the same reason this girl has been manipulated into sleeping with him; money. However, the Lawyer has tipped off the police, claiming her to be a prostitute, and, just hours after he leaves, the Constable bursts in while she's fixing her hair in a compact. Surprised, she knocks her bag over, spilling the contents, and the officer gives her an option- go to jail or sleep with him. In the album there are extended lyrics confirming this.\nMusic video.\nThe video shows the story of a \"pornomime\" and a girl who falls in love after she watches one of his performances. Their relationship is a fake one. Both \"relationships\" includes a fake feeling of confidence and are really useless in meaning. \nThe mime and his girlfriend both walk in on each other having affairs (pretended, of course), again showing the emptiness of their fake relationships. They are not making love to real people \u2014 it is a false impression. The video is the first from the band to be web-exclusive, mostly because they felt it was too offensive for television, but it has aired on MTV2 in the UK and is available on Music Choice On-demand.\nThe band does not appear in this video."}

If you use a more magnetic material as the core, you can get the magnetic field around the inductor to be pushed in towards the inductor, giving it better inductance. Small inductors can also be put onto integrated circuits using the same ways that are used to make transistors. Aluminum is usually used as the conducting material in this case.\nHow inductors work.\nWhile a capacitor does not like changes in voltage, an inductor does not like changes in current.\nIn general, the relationship between the time-varying voltage \"v\"(\"t\") across an inductor with inductance \"L\" and the time-varying current \"i\"(\"t\") passing through it is described by the differential equation:\nformula_1\nHow inductors are used.\nInductors are used often in analog circuits. Two or more inductors that have coupled magnetic flux make a transformer. Transformers are used in every power grid around the world.\nInductors are also used in electrical transmission systems, where they are used to lower the amount of voltage an electrical device gives off or lower the fault current.\nBecause inductors are heavier than other electrical components, people have been using them in electrical equipment less often.\nInductors with an iron core are used for audio equipment, power conditioning, inverter systems, rapid transit and industrial power supplies.\nElectrical engineers like to reduce diagrams of electrical circuits, no matter how complicated, to an \"equivalent circuit\" consisting of a network of just \"four\" different types of component. These four basic components are \"emfs\", \"resistors\", \"capacitors\", and \"inductors\". An inductor is usually represented by a little solenoid in circuit diagrams. In practice, inductors generally consist of short air-cored solenoids wound from enameled copper wire."}

There are other Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b in Algeria and Libya. The Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b probably started one of the earliest schools, which was founded less than 50 years after the death of Muhammad.\nThe name comes from Abdullah ibn Ibadh at-Tamini. Some of the branch's followers, however, claim that its true founder was Jabir ibn Zaid al-'Azdi, who was from Nizwa, Oman.\nDifferences from other types of Islam.\nIb\u0101\u1e0d\u012b communities are generally seen as conservative. For example, they reject the practice of \"qun\u016bt\" in which one asks Allah for things while one stands in prayer. Sunni Muslims traditionally consider the Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b to be an extremist Kharijite group because they came from that group. However, most Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b now believe that other Muslims are not \"kuffar\" \"unbelievers\", unlike most Kharijite groups, but \"kuffar an-nima\" \"unbelievers in God's grace.\" Most Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b now believe a true believer's attitude to others to be expressed in three religious obligations:\nUnlike the Kharijites, the Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b have abandoned the assassination of mainstream Muslims.\nThe Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b agree with Sunnis in approving of Caliphs Ab\u016b Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab, and both groups regarded them as rightly-guided caliphs. However, the Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b think that Uthman ibn Affan introduced \"bid'ah\" \"innovations\" to Islam and so approve of the revolt that overthrew him.\nThe Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b also approve of the first part of Ali's caliphate. Like the Shi'ites,the Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b disapprove of both Aisha's rebellion against him and Muawiya's revolt.\nHowever, the Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b regard Ali's acceptance of arbitration at the Battle of Siffin against Muawiyya's rebels as un-Islamic. The Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b consider that Al's decision made him unfit as iman, and they condemn Ali also for killing early Kharijites in an-Nahr at the Battle of Nahrawan.\nThe Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b also have several doctrinal differences from other types of Islam; here are the main ones:\nThe Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b believe that the fifth legitimate caliph was Abdullah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi. All caliphs from Mu\u02e4\u0101wiyya onwards are regarded as tyrants except Umar ibn Abdul Aziz on whom opinions differ. However, various later Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b leaders are recognized as true im\u0101ms, including Abdullah ibn Yahya al-Kindi of South Arabia and the im\u0101ms of the Rustamid dynasty in North Africa.\nThe Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b are also found in Jabal Nafusa in Libya, Mzab in Algeria, East Africa (particularly Zanzibar), and Djerba Island in Tunisia. The early medieval Rustamid dynasty in Algeria was Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b, and refugees from its capital, Tahert, founded the North African Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b communities, which still exist."}

It did not last for very long, and became the National Socialist German Workers' Party or Nazi Party (, acronym \"NSDAP\").\nOrigins.\nEight days before elections in Bavaria, the DAP was founded in Munich in the \"Caf\u00e9 Gasteig\" on 5 January 1919 by Anton Drexler and Michael Lotter. The DAP grew out of the 'Free Worker's Committee for a Good Peace' () which Drexler had also started.\nMost of the DAP's first members were friends of Drexler's from the Munich rail depot. Drexler wanted a party that was nationalist and aimed at ordinary people. Most other nationalist parties were middle class parties. The first membership was about forty people.\nOn 24 March 1919, Karl Harrer (a sports journalist and member of the Thule Society) joined the DAP to try to get more control over the DAP for the Thule Society. There were still not many members, and meetings were often held in local pubs.\nAdolf Hitler joins the DAP.\nWhen Adolf Hitler was still a corporal in the German army, he was ordered to spy on the DAP during one of its meetings at the \"Sterneckerbr\u00e4u\" on 12 September 1919.\nHitler was very good at making speeches, so Anton Drexler asked him to join the party. Hitler thought about this, and then joined near the end of September 1919. There were no membership numbers or cards when Hitler joined the party. In January 1920 the DAP began to give membership cards and numbers. They started at number 501 to make the party look bigger. Hitler got number 555, but he was also committee member number 7. Later Hitler said he was party member number 7, to make it look like he was a founder member of the DAP.\nFrom DAP to NSDAP.\nThe small number of party members were quick to believe in Hitler's ideas.\nTo try to make the party more popular the DAP changed its name on 24 February 1920 to the National Socialist German Workers' Party. The name was borrowed from a different Austrian party active at the time (Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei). At first Hitler wanted the new name to be the 'Social Revolutionary Party'; but Rudolf Jung persuaded Hitler to use NSDAP.\nMembership.\nHitler was the 55th member of the party.

The name \"\"theobromine\" comes from the word \"Theobroma\"\" as the name of the genus of the cacao tree (which itself is made up of the Greek roots \"theo\" (\"God\") and \"brosi\" (\"food\"), meaning \"food of the gods\") with the suffix given to alkaloids and other base nitrogen-containing compounds.\nTheobromine is a water-insoluble, crystalline, bitter powder. Its colour is listed as either white or colourless. It has a similar, but lesser, effect to caffeine, making it a lesser homologue. Theobromine is an isomer of theophylline as well as paraxanthine. Theobromine is categorized as a dimethyl xanthine, which means it is a xanthine with two methyl groups.\nTheobromine was first isolated from the seeds of the cacao tree in 1878 and then shortly afterwards was synthesized from xanthine by Hermann Emil Fischer.\nTheobromine is toxic to dogs."}

{"id": "91777", "revid": "1157339", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91777", "title": "New York City Subway", "text": "The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system that is in New York City, United States. It is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It is one of the biggest rapid transit systems in the world, with 472 stations. It has 245 miles (or 394 km) of routes on 691 miles (or 1112\u00a0km) of track. The New York City Subway almost never closes; the trains run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year. The system has only closed three times.\nThe first elevated trains started working on October 9, 1863, and the first underground trains started working on October 27, 1904.\nHistory.\nAlfred Ely Beach built an underground subway tunnel to test in 1869. His Beach Pneumatic Transit only extended under Broadway in Lower Manhattan. The subway car in the tunnel was pneumatic, or pushed by air. The tunnel was never made longer. It could have gone to Battery Park to the south and the Harlem River to the north.\nThe first underground subway line opened on October 27, 1904. The oldest elevated train line in the subway system opened in 1885. The oldest right-of-way was a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road. That railroad opened in 1863.\nBy the time the first subway opened, there were two private subway companies. They were the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Corporation (BRT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Most subway lines built after 1913 were built by the New York City government. These tracks were leased to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and city-run Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932.\nIn 1940, the two private systems were bought by the city. Some elevated train lines closed and were destroyed. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) was made in 1953 to run subway, bus, and streetcar operations. It was made part of Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968.\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was really bad to ride. There were very few people riding the subway. There was a lot of graffiti and crime on the subway. This was fixed in the 1990s.\nAfter the September 11 attacks, there were train disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded the subway system. It closed many lines for a long time.\nStations.\nThere are subway stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. About 40% of the tracks are above ground and the other 60% are below ground. Every day about 5,076,000 people take rides on the subway. 463 out of the system's 468 stations are always open.\nMany stations have \"mezzanines\". These are the levels of the station where you pay a fare before entering the subway platforms. Everyone must pay a fare to enter the subway system. They are usually between street level and platform level.\nMany station entrances and exits have lamp posts. At the top of the lamp posts are colored balls. Green balls usually show the station is open all day. Red balls can show two things. An entrance lamp post with a red ball can show that you can only enter during the daytime. There are also red exit lamp posts, which show that you can only exit the station. Some of the balls do not show the right information about an entrance or exit.\nMost subway stations have waiting platforms that are from long. People wait for trains on these platforms.\nAll new stations have platforms with air conditioning.\nMany stations also have artwork on the subway station walls.\nMost of the stations wers built before 1990. That is when a new law said that many new buildings, like subway stations, should have elevators and ramps so people with wheelchairs can enter these buildings.\nThe MTA has run the \"Music Under New York\" (MUNY) program in the subway since 1987. People must compete in order to be allowed to play music in a station. There are now more than 100 musicians and performers in the subway system.\nThere are only 129 open restrooms in 77 of the system's stations.\nSome platforms have newspaper stands as well. They sell many things, including newspapers and food. There are also stores in some stations.\nLines and routes.\nIn other cities' subway systems, a train \"line\" is the same as a train \"route\". In New York City's subway system, however, the \"line\" is the actual tracks, which a train \"route\" uses. \"Routes\", also called \"services\", have a letter or a number, such as \"1\" or \"A\". \"Lines\" have names, like \"Broadway Line\".\nThere are 24 train services. This includes 3 short \"shuttle\" routes. Each route has a color. R. Raleigh D'Adamo, a lawyer who entered a contest in 1964, planned the colors that are used on subway maps now. Before, subway maps used different colors for every route. People who live in New York City do not call lines and services by color (such as, Blue Line or Green Line). However, tourists often use colors to tell between routes.\nThere are three different types of subway services. \"Local\" trains make all stops at \"local\" stations as well as at \"express\" stations. \"Express\" trains skip some stations, but stop at \"express\" stations. There is one \"skip-stop\" service, the J/Z, where two train routes run on the same line; each route only stops at every other station along the line.\nThe subway system runs 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, but some routes do not run when not many people ride the subway. When a line is closed, the transit authority uses free shuttle buses. The transit authority shows planned service changes on its website, on station walls, inside subway cars, and through its Twitter page.\nRoutes.\nThere are many routes on the subway. Many people who have never ridden on the Subway get confused because there are so many routes going to so many different places. The Subway has signs that hang from the stations' ceilings to show the routes and where they go.\nRoutes on the \"A Division\", which used to be the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, are:\nRoutes on the \"B Division\", which used to belong to the Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation and Independent Subway System, are:\nFares.\nFrom 1904 until 1948, people paid a nickel to go into the subway. On July 1, 1948, the fare was raised to a dime. In July 1953, the fare was raised to 15 cents. The MTA gave out subway tokens, which people used to enter the subway. People stopped using tokens in 2003.\nThe fare is $2.75. Riders must pay with MetroCards. The subway started using them in 1994. At subway stations, riders can buy MetroCards from the station booth or from vending machines. Riders can also buy MetroCards from many places in New York City, like convenience stores and newspaper sellers.\nRider safety.\nRiders are allowed to take pictures using cameras, but are not allowed to take pictures with cameras that flash or with cameras that are on tripods.\nSubway police can search riders to make sure they do not have weapons or other items that could be used to hurt other people.\nWhen riders get hurt, usually it is because they slip when they are getting on or off the train. This is because there is a gap between the train and the platform. In recent times, workers have made the gaps smaller to prevent people from slipping. Often messages are played from loudspeakers that say \"Please watch the gap when entering and exiting the train\".\nTrain safety.\nThe MTA makes sure that New York City Subway trains run without accidents. There are railroad switches, railroad signals, and speed limits on the subway. All tracks also have a stopper on the side. If the train passes a red signal, the stopper will stop the train.\nA black-and-white striped board hangs above the middle of each platform. The conductor has to point to the board in front of him or her. After the conductor points to the board, the train doors will open.\nThe subway has had over 56 train accidents since 1918. The Malbone Street Wreck on November 1, 1918 was the most deadly. That crash killed 93 people.\nSince the late 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA has experimented with Automatic train operation. New York City Subway trains normally run with a train conductor and a train engineer. In 2006, the L train was the first route to be run by computers. The 7 train is becoming the second route to be run by a computer. There are computers both on the train and along the side of the tracks. The computer does the engineer's job by driving and stopping the train."}
{"id": "91778", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91778", "title": "Fundamentalism", "text": "Fundamentalism was used at first to describe some people in the Protestant community in the United States in the early 20th century. These people had a set of well-defined (\"fundamental\") values. These values were in opposition to more modern ideas. The group also said it was important to stick to what faith (and a more literal translation of the Bible) told them. When people look at religion this way they see the ideas in the religion as \"absolute\". This means that it is not possible for them to change. When religion is seen as absolute it becomes fundamentalism.\nToday, the term is used more generally. It is now often used to describe groups of people who are committed to behave or act according to their (mostly moral, and religious) values and beliefs even though these values may be criticised by many people or unpopular. Modern-day fundamentalists want to go back to the roots of certain ideological or religious positions. \nReligious fundamentalism has been prevalent in society since its beginnings in the late 19th- and early 20th-century. People today who study fundamentalism see it as a response to modern society. Today society is not as simple as it was: many people live in societies that can be difficult to understand. Changes in familiar things can make people feel unsafe. So some people look in their religion to see something that does not change. They also want rules about how to act that do not change. So they see their religion as this thing that does not change. \nSee Reformation for an older historical precedent.\nFundamentalism is also a trademarked brand of belts \"to Beat Children.\" Fundamentalism Leather Belts have been in countless art exhibits to satirize Fundamentalist Christians who think their God wants them to hit children. The artist and the only publicly recognized owner of Fundamentalism, Daniel Vander Ley, is a child-rights advocate who uses his brand \"Fundamentalism America's Premier Child Abuse Brand\" as a way to confront governments around the world about corporal punishment practices in schools and homes. Corporal Punishment still occurs in public schools in 19 American states.\nTerminology.\nSome people who are called religious fundamentalists do not like that name, as the term has other meanings. They do not like it because 'religious fundamentalist' has some negative ideas about it. Many people who are politically \"progressive\" or \"liberal\" sometimes do not like religious fundamentalists. They believe bad things about them like that they are not clever, they are not educated, or that they do not respect people's human rights. \nSome people who are Christian fundamentalists \"do\" like that term and use it to name themselves. But they do not like being called religious fundamentalists because Islamic fundamentalists are in this same group.\nHistory.\nFundamentalism began as a movement in the U.S., starting among conservative Presbyterian academics and theologians at Princeton Theological Seminary in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. It soon spread to conservatives among the Baptists and other denominations during and immediately following the First World War. The movement's purpose was to \"reaffirm\" orthodox Protestant Christianity and zealously defend it against the challenges of liberal theology, German higher criticism, Darwinism, and other movements which it regarded as harmful to Christianity.\nThe term \"fundamentalism\" has its roots in the Niagara Bible Conference (1878\u20131897) which defined those things that were \"fundamental\" to Christian belief. The term was also used to describe \"The Fundamentals\", a collection of twelve books on five subjects published in 1910 and funded by Milton and Lyman Stewart\nIssues of fundamentalism.\nNot all religious fundamentalists believe the same things. But there are many issues that they have strong beliefs about. Some of these issues are similar even in different religions. Some of these issues are:\nCriticism.\nMany criticisms of fundamentalist positions have been offered. One of the most common is that some claims made by a fundamentalist group cannot be proven, and are irrational, demonstrably false, or contrary to scientific evidence. . For example, some of these criticisms were famously asserted by Clarence Darrow in the Scopes Monkey Trial.\nAnother is that religious beliefs do not translate well into laws or social policy in diverse tolerant societies. This criticism favors secularism as a better foundation for social harmony and stability.\nOne of the critics, Elliot N. Dorff wrote:\nIn order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be (found...) among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word (requires) human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will."}

It started on June 13, 2006 with a weekly television series. The ECW brand was one of WWE's three brands, the other two being RAW and SmackDown.\nShow history.\nOriginal format.\nWWE got Extreme Championship Wrestling and its video library in 2003 and later began reintroducing ECW through a series of DVDs and books. The big popularity of ECW merchandise prompted WWE to organize ECW One Night Stand, an ECW reunion pay-per-view in 2005. The financial and critical success of the event encourages WWE to start a second One Night Stand the next year. With rejuvenated interest in the ECW product, WWE began exploring the possibility of reviving the promotion full-time. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced the launch of ECW as a stand-alone brand, congruous to Raw and SmackDown!, with its own show on the Sci Fi Channel. Despite initial concerns that professional wrestling would not be accepted by the Sci Fi Channel's demographic, network President Bonnie Hammer said that she believed ECW would fit the channel's theme of \"stretching the imagination\". Sci Fi Channel is owned by NBC Universal, parent company of USA Network and exclusive cable broadcaster of WWE programming.\nThe ECW brand initially tried to differentiate itself from WWE's other brands. The hard cameras were placed in a different location and the ring mat had an ECW logo on it. The male performers were also referred to as \"Extremists\" as opposed to Superstars, and female performers were called \"Vixens\" instead of Divas. It also had the first ECW talent. Later however, changes were made to differentiate it from the original ECW promotion, including changing the original promotion's rules where weapons were legal in all matches and there were rarely any count outs or disqualifications. WWE now classifies such matches as having \"Extreme Rules\", and are only fought when specified. The only pay-per-view event hosted exclusively by the ECW brand since its launch was December to Dismember in December 2006. On March 14, 2007, before another one could be scheduled, WWE announced that all future pay-per-views would feature all three brands.\nFormer ECW owner Paul Heyman served as the on air \"ECW Representative\". According to an interview in the UK newspaper The Sun, Heyman wrote the brand's weekly scripts and gave them to writers for possible changes, and then Vince McMahon for final approval. After the December to Dismember 2006 Heyman was relieved from both his on and off air duties with World Wrestling Entertainment. After Heyman left, there was no ECW authority figure until August 14, 2007, when Armando Estrada was announced as the General Manager.\nECW on Sci Fi.\nECW's weekly series was first given a thirteen episode run as a \"summer series\" on the Sci Fi Channel. The first episode got a 2.79 rating, making it the highest rated show on cable in its time slot. Because of its good ratings it was given an extended run through the end of 2007. On October 23, 2007, the network renewed the series through 2008.\nWhile the show started out a ratings success, it began drawing criticism from fans of the original ECW early on. This was most evident by the negative crowd reaction \"old school\" fans gave the main event of Batista vs. the Big Show at the show of August 1, 2006 from Hammerstein Ballroom.\nOn October 16, 2007 a \"talent exchange\" was started between the SmackDown! and ECW brands, allowing their respective talent to appear on either brand.\nOnline presence.\nAt ECW's launch, WWE.com introduced Hardcore Hangover, a video feature which allowed fans only in the United States to stream or download video footage from the weekly show. On October 16, 2007 it was replaced by a new feature which made full episodes of the show available for streaming on WWE.com the day after they were shown. After making a list of names from fans and conducting an online poll, the feature was named ECW X-Stream on October 31, 2007.\nProduction.\nECW brand shows are held in big arenas as a part of the SmackDown! brand's Tuesday taping schedule. This is in sharp contrast to the first Extreme Championship Wrestling which ran most of its events in smaller venues. The show usually airs live on Tuesdays directly before \u2013 when touring the west coast \u2013 or after \"SmackDown!\" has taped, though it has been recorded and placed on a broadcast delay until later in the night depending on what circumstances dictate.\nECW's initial theme song was \"Bodies\" by Drowning Pool, which had been used by WWE for Extreme Championship Wrestling since before the brand was established. Since then the theme song has changed between a number of different songs before settling on \"\"Don't Question My Heart\", sung by Kyle Morrison of the band Shattersphere. A remix of \"Don't Question My Heart\"\" by Saliva featuring Brent Smith is now used.\nStarting with the January 22, 2008 version, \"ECW\" began broadcasting in HD, along with a new HD set, which is shared among all three WWE brands.\nTheme song.\nECW's initial theme song was \"Bodies\" by Drowning Pool, which had been used by WWE for Extreme Championship Wrestling since before the brand was established. Since then the theme song has changed between a number of different songs before settling on \"\"Don't Question My Heart\", sung by Kyle Morrison of the band Shattersphere. A remix of \"Don't Question My Heart\"\" by Saliva featuring Brent Smith was in use when the show ended.\nTelevision Finale.\nOn February 2, 2010, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced that \"ECW\" would be going off the air and would be replaced with a new weekly program in its slot in what McMahon announced as \"the next evolution of WWE; the next evolution of television history.\" It was later announced that the show would air its final episode on February 16, 2010. On the February 4, 2010 episode of \"WWE Superstars\", the new show's name was announced as \"WWE NXT\". The ECW brand is set to be disbanded, with every ECW wrestler becoming a free agent after the show ends.\nInternational broadcasters.\nIn addition to being broadcast on Syfy in the United States, \"ECW\" was broadcast on a number of channels in many different countries."}

The written language showed no vowels, so the pronunciation is not agreed on. However, most academics agree that \"Yahweh\" is the most accepted way to say it.\nIt has also been pronounced as \"Yehova\" in Hebrew as a substitute word for the tetragrammaton. This is because Hebrew pointing, or vowel symbols, are often put under the YHWH, making . The vowels used come from the Hebrew word for Lord, \"Adonai\", which after the last captivity, was substituted and the vowels of \"Adonai\" forced into the tetragrammaton, incorrectly spelling God's Hebrew name as \"YaHoVaH\".\nIt was never meant to be anything more than a substitute to avoid pronouncing the tetragrammaton. \nTraditionally, religious Jews today do not often say this name aloud. This is because it is believed to be too holy to be spoken. However, they often use substitutes when referring to the name of their God. For example, they use HaShem (\"The Name\") or Shem HaMeforash (\u201cthe indescribable Name\u201d). \nToday, the three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) say that there is only one God, defined in the Judeo/Christian\nScriptures as Yahweh almost 7,000 times, with the general name \"Elohim\" a distant second at 2,500 times. Yahweh was spoken often by Jews. In\nthe New Testament, Yahweh is also present with the expanded name of Yahshua (Jesus), meaning \"Yahweh(Yah) Saves(shua).\nSometimes the four letters are called the \"Tetragrammaton\", which is Greek for \"four letters\"\nThe Hebrew languages has no vowels as was used in Latin or eventually, English. Therefore, the Tetragrammaton, translated from Hebrew to Latin was JHWH. Eventually, it was JHVH in English. Since it does not contain vowels, as does English, vowels were inserted to make the name pronouncable. Therefore JHVH became JEHOVAH.\nThese four letters are usually JHWH in German, French and Dutch, and either YHWH, YHVH, JHWH or JHVH in English. In some English language Bibles, it is written in all capital letters as \"LORD,\" as in Jewish tradition. Others, such as the Jerusalem Bible use \"Yahweh\". The Holman Christian Study Bible uses\n\"Yahweh\" when there is a reference to his name; God's Word Translation uses all of the Hebrew transliterations for the name of God.\nThe name Jehovah is used by the religious organisation of Jehovah's Witnesses based on early English Bible translations repeated by the KJV. They are not the only religious group to pronounce the holy name as Jehovah. When settlers of different religions arrived to settle lands in North America, the name Jehovah was widely used. It is still used by several regions besides Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \nIn 2008, the \"Vatican\" reiterated a directive that the full name YAHWEH should not be used in Catholic liturgy out of respect for the Jews who never pronounce the full word and YHWH was to be used instead."}

For many years, Fallaci was a special correspondent for the political magazine \"L'Europeo\" and wrote for a number of leading newspapers and \"Epoca\" magazine. During the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre prior to the 1968 Summer Olympics, Fallaci was shot three times, dragged down stairs by her hair, and left for dead by Mexican forces. The demonstrations by immigrants in the United States these past few months \"disgust\" her, especially when protesters displayed the Mexican flag. \"I don't love the Mexicans,\" Fallaci said, invoking her nasty treatment at the hands of Mexican police in 1968. \"If you hold a gun and say, 'Choose who is worse between the Muslims and the Mexicans,' I have a moment of hesitation. Then I choose the Muslims, because they have broken my balls.\"\nIn the late 1970s, she had an affair with the subject of one of her interviews, Alexandros Panagoulis, who was a big rebel in the Greek resistance against the 1967 dictatorship, having been captured, heavily tortured and imprisoned for his (unsuccessful) assassination attempt against dictator and ex-Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos. In 1972 she interviewed Henry Kissinger.\nFallaci has twice received the St. Vincent Prize for journalism, as well as the Bancarella Prize (1971) for \"Nothing, and So Be It\"; Viareggio Prize (1979), for \"Un uomo: Romanzo\"; and Prix Antibes, 1993, for \"Inshallah\".

Often the ruins have all sorts of interesting things buried in them. Archaeologists call the things that they find \"artefacts\". Artefacts might include beautiful artworks, jewellry and gold coins but usually they are ordinary things like cooking pots, mugs, spoons, hair combs, pipes, old shoes, broken toys and rats' nests. Historians use the evidence found by the archaeologists to write about the place and what might have happened there. \nOther people who find ruins very interesting are artists.

It is a Trojan, sharing an orbit with Jupiter. It was found in 1907 by August Kopff, and was the second Trojan asteroid to be found. Recent evidence suggests that the objects are icy comets, rather than rocky asteroids.\nOrbit.\nPatroclus orbits in Jupiter's trailing Lagrangian point, L5, in an orbit called the 'Trojan node' after one of the sides in the legendary Trojan War (the other node is called the 'Greek node'). Patroclus is the only object in the Trojan camp to be named after a Greek character; the naming rules for the Trojan asteroids were not made until after Patroclus was named (similarly, the asteroid Hektor is the only Trojan character to appear in the Greek camp).\nBinary.\nIn 2001, it was found that Patroclus is a binary object, made up of two asteroids which are almost the same size. In February, 2006, a team of astronomers led by Franck Marchis measured accurately the orbit of the system using the Keck Laser guide star adaptive optics system. They thought that the two asteroids orbit around their center of mass in 4.283\u00b10.004 d at a distance of 680\u00b120 km, describing a close to circular orbit. Putting together their sightings with thermal measurements taken in November 2000, the team thought what the size of the asteroids of the system could be. The slightly bigger asteroids, which measures 122 km in diameter, continues to have the name Patroclus. The smaller asteroid, measuring 112 km, is now named Menoetius (full name (617) Patroclus I Menoetius), after the legendary Patroclus's father. Its provisional designation was S/2001 (617) 1.\nWhat they are made of.\nBecause of the density of the asteroids (0.8 g/cm\u00b3) is less than water and about one third that of rock, the team of researchers led by F. Marchis suggest that the Patroclus system, previously thought to be a pair of rocky asteroids, is more similar to a comet in make up. It is thought that many Trojan asteroids are in fact small planetesimals captured in the Lagrange point of Jupiter-Sun system during the farther migration of the giant planets, 3.9 billion years ago. This scenario was suggested by A. Morbidelli and colleagues in a series of articles published in May 2005 in \"Nature\" journal."}

They first came from south London.\nName.\nThe band thought of the name 'The Maccabees' by opening the Bible to a random page. Even though the name has religious meaning, lead singer Orlando Weeks said that none of the band are religious in an interview on Steve Lamacq's BBC Radio 1 show.\nHistory.\nThe Maccabees' debut single, 'X-Ray', was released on the Promise record label on 28 November 2005. It was played a little in the evenings on London radio station Xfm London. The band got very attentiong until six months later, when they released their second single, 'Latchmere'. The song was about the wave machine at the band's local Latchmere Leisure Centre in Battersea, south London. It was released on Fierce Panda Records in April 2006. This song was talked about by Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacqu and was played on MTV2. The video, directed by Hugh Frost and Samuel Bebbington, also became a hit after it was put on YouTube.\nIn mid-2006, the music magazine NME wrote favourable things about the band, such as a review of their show at Cafe d\u00e9 Paris in London. The magazine called the band \"the best new band in Britain\".\nIn November 2006 the band toured, or traveled and played, with Fields, \u00a1Forward, Russia!, and Wolfmother as part of the MTV Two \"Brand Spanking New Music\" tour. Drummer Robert Dylan Thomas broke his wrist just before the band were due to begin touring, and was replaced by drummer Elliott Andrews. Elliot toured with the band until early 2007, and now plays drums for Kate Nash.\nThe band are currently signed to Fiction Records, and released their debut album 'Colour It In' in May 2007. Because the album had been leaked, or accidentally put, on the internet, 'Colour It In' became available to download exclusively from iTunes on 17 April before its release on 14 May. The song First Love was the Maccabees' first to chart in the UK top 40. It was followed by 'About Your Dress', which charted at #33. Their next album was released to positive reviews, and charted at #24. They toured the USA with fellow Indie group Bloc Party. A UK tour happened in October 2007, ending in a show at the Roundhouse venue in London, where all the tickets were sold.\nDuring late 2007, Samsung used the song Toothpaste Kisses in advertising for its SGH-G800 mobile phone.\nThe band is currently writing music for another album.\nBand members.\nThe band worked together to write the lyrics.\nOrlando makes the band's artwork.

It is different from a hospital, because people do not stay in a clinic for a long time. Some clinics can become as large as hospitals, but still have the name Clinic. Small clinics are run by one or more general practitioners or practice managers. Physiotherapy clinics are run by physiotherapists, psychology clinics run by clinical psychologists, and so on for each type of health care. Some clinics are operated, or run, by employers. Other clinics are owned by people who do not have medical education, like in China.\nSome clinics are a place for people with injuries or illness to come and be seen by triage nurse or other health worker. In these clinics, the injury or illness may not be large or dangerous enough to warrant a visit to an emergency room, but the person can be moved to one if they need to be. These clinics sometimes can use equipment such as X-ray machines. Doctors at these clinics can send patients to specialists, a doctor who is very good at one kind of medicine.\nWhere the word came from.\nThe word \"clinic\" comes from the Greek word \"klinein\", which means to put something at an angle, or to lie down.

Giorgio Vasari, who wrote the \"Lives of the Artists\" said he had \"a rare and perfect talent\".\nFra Angelico has been known by many different names. When he was born, he was called Guido di Pietro. People who knew him when he was older called him Fra Giovanni da Fiesole (Brother John from Fiesole). When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in \"Lives of the Artists\", in the 1500s, he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico (Brother Giovanni who is like an Angel).\nThe Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico (the Blessed Angelico). He has been called this for a long time, because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting, and also because he was such a good and holy man. The name \"Blessed Angelico\" has now been made official, because in 1982 Pope John Paul II \"conferred beatification\" which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint.\nVasari says about him: \"It is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father, who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said, and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life, circa 1385\u20131436.\nFra Angelico was born in Mugello near Fiesole in Tuscany, Italy probably about 1385\u201387 and died in Rome in 1455. Nothing is known about his parents. He was baptized Guido or Guidolino.\nIn 1407, he joined the Dominican Order at Fiesole. In 1423, when he became officially a friar, he changed his name from Guido to Fra Giovanni (Brother John). (People who are accepted into a holy order, usually take a new name.) Like the other \"brothers\" (friars) of the Dominican Order, he wore a white robe and a black cloak, and shaved part of his head.\nFra Angelico had a brother called Benedetto who was also a Dominican friar. Fra Benedetto painted illuminated manuscripts. Fra Angelico possibly learnt to paint manuscripts as well. The convent of San Marco in Florence has several manuscript books that he is thought to have painted. He was very busy with other work at the convents where he lived, but he still found time to paint pictures, which very soon became famous. In January and February of 1418, he was paid for paintings that he did in the church of Santo Stefano del Ponte.\nBetween 1418 and 1436, Fra Angelico painted an altarpiece for the church in Fiesole, which has been damaged. Age caused the some of the paint to come off, or fade, and other artists have painted over some of Fra Angelico's work while trying to repair the paintings. The top part of the altarpiece is in the National Gallery, London. It shows Christ in Glory, surrounded by more than 250 figures, and is a large and magnificent piece of work. It has been described as one of the best works in the gallery.\nSan Marco, Florence, 1436\u20131445.\nIn 1436, a new Dominican Convent of San Marco was established in Florence in some older monastery buildings. Fra Angelico was one of the friars from Fiesole who moved to Florence. This was an important move for Fra Angelico because Florence already had a great number of artists from whom he could learn. The convent had a very wealthy \"patron of the arts\" called Cosimo de' Medici who loved to buy works of art for himself and his favourite churches. Cosimo took the largest of the friars' rooms, called cells, at the convent so that he could have a quiet place for religious thought. Fra Angelico painted a picture showing the Magi at Bethlehem on the wall of Cosimo's cell.\nCosimo employed Fra Angelico to paint more pictures for the convent. All the cells for the friars were built upstairs around the sides of a square courtyard with a garden in the middle (called a cloister). On the wall at the top of the stairs, Fra Angelico painted a fresco of the Angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This is one of his most famous pictures. Fra Angelico then began to paint a picture in each of the monk's cells. Each cell has large picture with a round top on the wall beside the window. At least six of these paintings were done be by Fra Angelico, and others were done by artists who copied his style of painting. These pictures were to help the friars with their prayers.\nIn 1439, he finished one of his most famous works, which is the altarpiece for San Marco's Church, which is where the friars worship. It shows the Madonna and Child on a throne, surrounded by saints from different dates, who are all grouped together as if they were standing in a room in Heaven, talking about holy things. This type of painting called a \"Sacred Conversation\" later became very popular, but this is one of the first ones.\nThe Vatican, 1445\u20131455.\nIn 1445, Pope Eugenius IV sent a message for Fra Angelico to come to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at St Peter's. The chapel was later demolished by Pope Paul III to make way for the new St.Peter's Basilica and Fra Angelico's work was lost. Vasari says that one of the popes (it might have been Eugenius or Pope Nichoas V) asked Fra Angelico if he would like the very important job of Archbishop of Florence. But Fra Angelico did not want such a high job and he suggested the name of another friar for the position. In 1447 Fra Angelico went to the city of Orvieto with his pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, to paint some pictures for the Cathedral there . One of his other pupils was called Zanobi Strozzi, but he did not become as famous as Benozzo.\nFrom 1447 to 1449, Fra Angelico was back at the Vatican, where Pope Nicholas V had built a small chapel where he could pray privately. The pictures that Fra Angelico and his pupils painted there are the lives of two young saints St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, who were both \"martyrs\" (they were killed because of their Christian faith). The small chapel, with its bright colours and gold leaf decorations is like a jewel box. From 1449 until 1452, Fra Angelico was back at his old convent of Fiesole, where he was the Prior (the head man). Fra Angelico's pupils were probably left in Rome to finish the work on the chapel.\nDeath and beatification.\nIn 1455, Fra Angelico went back to Rome, probably to look at the work in Pope Nicholas' Chapel. He died at the Dominican Convent and was buried in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope John Paul II beatified Fra Angelico on October 3, 1982, making him \"officially\" known as the \"Blessed Angelico\". In 1984 the pope made him the patron of Catholic artists.\nFra Angelico never wanted to be important, and even though he was so talented he never put himself above other people. He thought his most important job was caring for others. He always prayed before he picked up his brushes to paint, and he never made any changes to his pictures later, because he believed that the Holy Spirit was guiding him. He painted a great number of scenes of the Crucifixion and he would always cry while he was painting them.\nThe words on his grave say:\nAbout Fra Angelico's paintings.\nFra Angelico was working at a time when the style of painting was in a state of change. The changes had begun a hundred years before his time with the works of Giotto. Fra Angelico would have seen the famous pictures of the \"Life of Saint Francis\" that Giotto did for the church of Santa Croce in Florence. In Giotto's paintings the figures look more real and solid and lifelike than in the pictures of other painters of the 1300s. Giotto was also very good at painting the emotions on peoples faces and the actions that showed how they were feeling. His work was a big influence on every artist who saw it.\nAt the same time, rich patrons like Cosimo de Medici liked to show off their wealth. They often did this by ordering paintings that had lots of bright colour and real gold backgrounds. The red colour called \"vermilion\" was one of the most expensive. But the most expensive colour was a beautiful blue made by grinding up a semi-precious stone called Lapis lazuli. This type of painting is called \"International Gothic\". Some artists of Fra Angelico's day were expert at doing paintings that would make very rich people happy. But other painters, like Masaccio were followers of Giotto and painted in a very plain way.\nFra Angelico was able to paint in both ways. If the Pope or a rich family wanted an altarpiece or a fresco that had gold and expensive bright colours, then Fra Angelico could do it. But his most famous paintings have no gold and no bright colours. They are the simple gentle paintings of the life of Jesus that he did for the friars in their cells at San Marcos.\nGallery.\nThis gallery shows stories from the life of Jesus. The square paintings are in tempera. They are all parts of a big altarpiece and are about 25\u00a0cm wide. The \"tondo\" (round painting) is a small altarpiece about 1.4 metres wide. All the paintings with arched tops are frescos and were painted for the Dominican brothers. "}

{"id": "92076", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92076", "title": "Giorgio Vasari", "text": "Giorgio Vasari (, , ; 30 July 1511 \u2013 27 June 1574) was an Italian painter, architect and writer. He is most famous for his book \"The Lives of the Great Architects, Painters and Sculptors of Italy\", which is usually known as \"Vasari's Lives\". Although some other writers had written about art, this book, which was published in 1550 makes Vasari the first art historian.\nVasari's life.\nVasari was born in 1511 to a rich family in the city of Arezzo in Tuscany. When he was 13 he was sent to Florence to study at the workshops of the well-known artists Andrea del Sarto. Florence is so famous for the arts that students like Vasari have been going there to learn painting and sculpture, ever since Giotto in the 1200s. The two most famous artists in the world, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were both alive when Vasari was a boy and had both studied in Florence. Vasari had the good luck to meet Michelangelo, who was like a great hero to Vasari.\nVasari learnt well, and became one of the favourite artists of the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family who ruled Florence at that time. He did all sorts of important jobs for them. One of the most important buildings in the city was the Palazzo Vecchio (the \"Old Palace\") which was really a Medieval fortress, where the town council had always met. Vasari got the job of decorating the walls of the enormous meeting room with painted frescos.\nVasari was very good at directing important artistic jobs, but he was not really as good a painter as he was architect. One of his most important architectural jobs was to begin the building of the Uffizi (Offices) in Florence. These are two long buildings that face each other across a long narrow courtyard with one end opening on the town square, and the other end opening onto the Arno River. At the end where the river is, Vasari designed a beautiful \"loggia\" which is a sort of two-storey veranda that joins the two buildings. It makes the narrow courtyard and the view of the river look like a stage set where wonderful things might happen. The Uffizi is now one of the most famous art galleries in the world.\nVasari had another important job for the Medici family. Eleanor, the wife of Duke Cosimo I, had bought a house. It was by far the biggest house in the city, and was across the river from the Uffizi. The Medici family was not always popular. The previous duke, Alessandro, had been murdered. So to keep the family safe, they needed an escape route from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Pitti Palace on the other side of the river. Vasari was expected to design it. The escape route is named after its designer. It is called the \"Vasari Corridor\".\nThe corridor begins at the Palazzo Vecchio and runs along the top floor of the Uffizi and across the loggia near the river, then it runs on top of arches along the street by the riverbank, above a nice covered walkway at street-level where nowadays people can buy souvenirs. The Vasari Corridor then gets to a bridge, the Ponte Vecchio. It is the oldest, most famous bridge in the city, and on both sides it had rows of shops and houses. But the Medici did not mind that! They just had anything that was in the way pulled down. When the Corridor gets to the other side of the river, it makes some twists and turns. Some buildings were knocked down to make way, but the Mannelli family who lived in a large tower were not so obliging and so the corridor is made to go around its walls. Eventually it gets to the Pitti Palace, which is an enormous building of brown stone, with big carved lions' heads beneath all the windows. Vasari built other buildings that are more beautiful, but the Vasari Corridor is probably his most famous.\n\"Vasari's Lives\".\nVasari's masterpiece is his book, \"The Lives of the Great Architects, Painters and Sculptors of Italy\", first published in 1550. It is a book of biography. It tells the stories of the lives of Italian artists from Giotto who lived around 1300 to Michelangelo who was still alive when Vasari was writing his book. For some of the artists, very little is known about them except the stories that Vasari heard and wrote in his book. Even though nowadays it is known that Vasari sometimes made mistakes, he gives a wonderful picture of the characters of the artists, and tells all sorts of amusing stories.\nVasari does not just tell the stories of the artists' lives. He also describes their artworks in great detail. It is because of Vasari that art historians know of many important artworks that have been lost. It is because of Vasari that we know that the Mona Lisa once had eyebrows. Vasari writes about the artworks as a history. He believed that the Gothic art of the Middle Ages was not as good as the art of Florence in the 15th century (1400s) and that Michelangelo, who painted in the early 16th century (1500s) was the greatest artist since the days of Ancient Greece. He believed that the change towards the great art of the Renaissance began with Giotto around 1300. Vasari puts all these ideas into his book and shows how one artist learnt from each other, and how the changes in art came about. \"Vasari's Lives\" is the first art history book that was ever written."}

She decides to run away from home just long enough to show her family what they would be missing without her. Unfortunately, she does not enjoy hardship or discomfort, so running away has lots of problems. To solve this problem, Claudia decides to stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

During their stay, they become fascinated with the newest exhibit: a beautiful statue of an angel, thought to have been crafted by Michelangelo.

{"id": "92208", "revid": "7224005", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92208", "title": "Messiah (Handel)", "text": "Messiah is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel. It is Handel\u2019s most famous work, and in England, the most often performed of any big choral work. The title Messiah means \u201cthe anointed one\u201d and is the name given to Jesus Christ in the Christian teaching.\nBackground to its composition.\nGeorg Frideric Handel was born in Germany. When he was a young man he came to England and he liked it so much that he soon visited England again and stayed there for the rest of his life, becoming a naturalised Englishman says the legend. Actually he was composer for the King of Hannover, who then became King of England, and Handel followed his \"employer\".\nThe main reason why Handel liked England at that time was because the people liked his music and gave him support. At this time Handel was known as a composer of operas. For about 20 years Handel spent most of his time working on operas: composing them, organising performances and looking for opera singers to sing his works.\nBy the late 1730s, however, people\u2019s tastes started to change and opera was not so popular. Handel changed to writing oratorios. Although it is thought that Handel invented the oratorio he in fact did not.Oratorio is Italian, after the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri at Rome, where famous musical services were held in the 16th century. Handel is just one composer of many who wrote oratorios. His oratorios are based on the English tradition of the Masque, which was something between a play and an opera. However, oratorios were about stories from the Old Testament. Instead of ancient gods or Roman emperors (which is what operas were about at that time) he used dramatic stories from the Bible. Among many great oratorios that he wrote, \"Messiah\" is his most famous one. However, it is different from his other oratorios in some ways.\nHandel composes the Messiah.\nThe words of \"Messiah\" were written by a librettist Charles Jennens. He chose several passages from the Bible and made a libretto, which he sent to Handel in 1741 (although people today often call the work \"The Messiah\u201d, both Handel and Jennens call it \"Messiah\" without the word \u201cthe\u201d). Handel immediately realized that a great work of music could be made from Jennens\u2019 libretto. He thought that Jennens was a very clever person, and in his letters to him he calls the work \u201cYour Oratorio \"Messiah\"\u201d. Handel sat down in the front room of his house in Brook Street, London, and wrote the whole oratorio in twenty four days. It is a long work, lasting over four hours, and when one thinks that Handel had to write out all the parts for the choir and orchestra, he must have worked unbelievably hard. When he had finished the work, he put it in a drawer for seven weeks. Perhaps he thought it would never be played in London, because at that time the London audiences did not seem to like him.\nHandel goes to Dublin.\nJust at that time he got an invitation to go to Dublin. He was asked to give a concert to get money for charity. The main charity for which money was being raised was the debtor\u2019s prison. In those days people who ran into debt (meaning that they owed lots of people money but had no money to pay them) were sent to prison. There they were fed by charity (people who fed them out of kindness). If no one fed them they just starved to death. Handel had nearly been sent to a debtor\u2019s prison himself a few years earlier. \nHe went to Dublin as soon as he could, and he was there by November. On 23 December he performed his oratorio \"L\u2019Allegro\". Unlike the London audiences, people in Dublin loved it. This was followed by \"Alexander\u2019s Feast\", \"Imeneo\" and, in April, \"Messiah\". He was a very great success in Dublin, and he stayed there until August, when he returned to London.\nThe music.\n\"Messiah\" tells the story of Christ. It is divided into three parts. Part One tells of the coming and the birth of Christ. Part Two is about his death on the cross, and his Ascension into Heaven, and Part III concentrates on Paul's teaching of the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven. Handel usually performed his oratorios in theatres, not in churches, and his audience went as a change from going to the opera. They did not go for religious worship. \nHandel\u2019s oratorios are normally dramatic, with the four solo singers (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) each taking the part of a character from the Bible. \"Messiah\" is different. The soloists sing about the story of Christ. The great choruses, where the choir sings, praise the Lord in the wonderful music. Some of the music is homophonic (e.g. the \"Hallelujah\" chorus), some of the choruses are dramatic dialogues (e.g. \"Lift up your heads\"), or they are a fugue (\"He trusted in God\" and \"Amen\"), or they describe things dramatically (\"All we like sheep\").\nThe Hallelujah Chorus.\nThe most well known of all the movements in \"Messiah\" is the one popularly known as the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" because of the frequently sung exclamation \u201cHallelujah\u201d. It occurs at the end of the Part Two of the oratorio.'\nIt has become a tradition for the audience to stand up for the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" although it is unknown when this practice began.\nThere is a well-known but apocryphal story of King George II\nattending a royal performance of \"Messiah\" and supposedly rising to his feet during the \"Hallelujah Chorus\".\"\" Whenever the king stood up, everyone in his presence had to stand, hence the whole audience rose to their feet as well. However, this story does not appear to be based on any historical source. "}

During World War I, he was \"mentioned in despatches\" and got got medals while fighting on the Western Front in France. In World War II and he was made commander of the 20th Brigade that helped beat Erwin Rommell's \"Afrika Korps\" in \"Libya\".\nEarly Life.\nMurray was born on born 26 April 1892 in Sydney, New South Wales. His father was working man from Ireland. His father was also called John Murray and his mother was called Margaret. \nWhen he left the local Catholic school John Murray started training as a salesman for Sydney firm Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons in 1910. He then joined the Australian Citizens Military Forces where he served two years before joining the 33rd Regiment in 1913.\nWorld War I.\nJohn Murray was already in the Australian Army when World War I started on 28 July 1914. He was quickly (fast) made a Second Lieutenant on 6 March 1915. When he started being Second Lieutenant, Murray was moved to the Australian Imperial Force, and went by ship to Egypt. After being posted to the 1st Battalion at first, in March, 1916 he was moved to the 53rd Battalion, which was part of the 5th Division, when the Australian Imperial Force was helped by new soldiers from Australia. The 5th Division was soon moved from Egypt to France where they were put into the hard fighting of the Western Front.\nBy 19 July 1916 Murray's 53rd Battalion were in the first fighting by the Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front. It was the Battle of Fromelles. 5,533 Australian soldiers were killed, wounded or taken prisoner, because the fighting plan went wrong. The Australian War Memorial sayss the fighting was \"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history\" \nJohn Murray became a Major in June 1917 and was soon known for his very good leadership and very brave \"night raiding\" (crossing at night into enemy trenches). In September 1918 during the very hard fighting of the Second Battle of the Somme, Murray's good leadership was mentioned again, and after fights near Peronne, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.\nMurray was still fighting on the Western Front when peace started 11 November 1918. Having been awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Service Order, and also having twice being told of in dispatches he went back home to Australia in May, 1919.\nBetween the Wars.\nBy 25 August 1919 the all of the men in the Australian Imperial Force had been sent home. Murray was happy to go back to his job at Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons in Sydney, but he did not want to stop being a soldier, and he joined the Australian Citizens Military Forces.\nOn 4 January 1923 John Murray married Mary Madeline Cannon at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and soon after became the manager of the delivery department at Anthony Hordern &amp; Sons.\nBy 1925 Murray became a of Lieutenant-Colonel. From 1934 to 1938 Murray was the Commanding Officer of the Australian Army Service Corps, 1st Division.\nWorld War II.\nWith war coming again, John Murray was given the command of the 9th Infantry brigade, and they got ready to move for war in February, 1940. He was chosen for the Second Australian Imperial Force in April 1940 and was given command of the 20th Brigade which went by ship to the Middle East in October 1940 to begin training in Palestine.\nTobruk.\nMurrays brigade was made a part of the 9th Division. Even though the troops were not ready to fight, the 9th Division was sent to Libya to help the 6th Division win Tobruk. \nOn 4 April 1941, the \"Afrika Korps\" starting fighting Murray's 20th Brigade. The Australians slowed down Rommell's forces, but there were so many Germans they could not be forced back. Murray and his troops moved into Tobruk itself. For his leadership, John Murray was granted a \"bar\" to his Distinguished Service Order (the bar is given instead of a second medal).\nMurray's knowledge of Trench warfare and night-raiding was very helpful to the defenders during the Siege of Tobruk. In November 1941, Murray was mentioned in dispatches for the third time in his career for his excellent resistance to Rommell.\nBattle for Australia.\nMurray returned to Australia in January 1942, just as the Japan was fighting south towards New Guinea. Instead of the recruiting job he expected, Murray was put in charge of the Newcastle Covering Force, and immediately promoted him to temporary Major-General.\nThe Newcastle Covering Force was soon re-named the 10th Division and Murray was sent to Western Australia in August 1942 to lead the 4th Division which was then moved to North Queensland due to fears of Japanese invasion during April and May 1943.In October 1944, he was made General of the Rear Echelon at Mareeba, before commanding the Northern Territory Force from March, 1945 until January, 1946, when he retired.\nPost War.\nJohn Murray was made Australian trade commissioner to New Zealand from 1946 until 1949 and then the same role for \"Ceylon\" in 1949. \nGeneral John Murray died on 8 September 1951 at the Military Hospital, Concord, Sydney. He received a funeral with full military honours, and was buried in French's Forest Cemetery. His wife, three sons and two daughters survived him."}

It was found in 1907 by August Kopff.\nHektor is a D-type asteroid, dark and reddish in colour. It lies in Jupiter's leading Lagrangian point, L4, called the 'Greek' node after one of the two sides in the legendary Trojan War. Ironically, Hektor is named after the Trojan hero Hektor, and is thus one of two Trojan asteroids that is \"misplaced\" in the wrong camp (the other being 617 Patroclus in the Trojan node).\nHektor is one of the most stretched bodies of its size in the solar system, being 370 \u00d7 200\u00a0km. It is thought that Hektor might be a contact binary (two asteroids joined by gravitational attraction) like 216 Kleopatra. Hubble Space Telescope sightings of Hektor in 1993 did not show an obvious stretched shape because of a limited angular resolution. On July 17, 2006, the Keck-10m II telescope and its Laser guide star Adaptive Optics (AO) system indicated a stretched shape for Hektor. Additionally, since this AO system provides an excellent and stable correction (angular resolution of 0.060 arcsec in K band), a 15-km moon at 1000\u00a0km from Hektor was found. The moon's provisional designation is S/2006 (624) 1. Hektor is, so far, the only known binary Trojan asteroid in the L4 point and the first Trojan with a moon. 617 Patroclus, another big Trojan asteroid in the L5, is made of two same-sized asteroids."}

Nicknamed the \"Oricon comet\" for her success in Japan, she has currently released eight singles and one album in that country with varying degrees of success. Also, many of her songs have been featured in TV shows.\nYounha was signed to Epic Records, a branch of Sony Music Entertainment Japan, from 2004 to 2008. She then moved to Sistus Records, a Geneon Entertainment label. In South Korea, she is signed to Lion Media and Stam Entertainment.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn in South Korea to musical parents, Younha began to play the piano at the age of 4. She developed an interest in Japanese drama shows and began to teach herself Japanese. Before long, she was skilled enough to translate to her school friends what happened on recent Japanese TV episodes. What began as an interest in Japanese dramas developed into an interest in Japanese music. At the recommendation of an older student in her school's broadcasting club, she listened to such artists such as Utada Hikaru and Misia. Younha began to dream about debuting as a singer alongside her favorite artists.\n2004 - 2005: Early Career &amp; Moderate Success.\n\u3086\u3073\u304d\u308a(Yubikiri) Era.\nIn order to seek her dreams, she began to try out in auditions within Korea. She claimed that she went through as many as 20 auditions. She also commented in her interview that certain companies refused to sign her to their labels because they believed she was not \"pretty\" enough, although she sang very well. Her mother also discouraged her dream and even locked her bedroom door to prevent Younha from leaving the house. Younha, however, climbed out the window and made it to the audition. At one audition, she made an overwhelming impression and signed a contract with a Korean company. Soon after, Younha's voice was heard by a company in Japan. In order to make her childhood dream of debuting in Japan come true, Younha underwent recording while going back and forth between Korea and Japan. Quickly, Younha's Japanese skills advanced so much that she surprised even the staff around her.\nAfter a TV drama producer heard her demo tape, her song \"Yubikiri\" was chosen as the insert song for the Fuji TV Monday drama show \"Tokyo Wankei ~Destiny of Love~\". In October of that same year, she debuted with her official first single \"Yubikiri\".\nHoukiboshi to Go! Younha Era.\nYounha's second single \"Houkiboshi\" was used as an ending song for the popular anime show \"BLEACH\". It became a hit - debuting on the Oricon chart at #18, it peaked at #12 and propelled Younha into the limelight. With this single, she became only the second Korean, after BoA, to have broken the Oricon chart's top 20. Between \"Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki\" and \"Houki Boshi\", she released \"Motto Futari de\". It flopped massively, only reaching #117 on the Oricon Charts possibly due to a lack of promotion. Her later single, \"Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki\", first charted at the #15, with the tie-in and went as high as #11. After releasing five singles, Younha released her first album entitled \"Go! Younha\". It reached the #10 spot on the Oricon weekly charts.\n2006: Later Struggles and Korean Debut.\nTewo Tsunaide to Hakanaku Tsuyoku Era.\n\"My Lover\" was a re-cut single from Go! Younha, her debut album, and was re-cut because it was the theme to the \"Bleach GC: Tasogare Ni Mamieru Shini Kami\". It was limited to 70,000 copies and flopped, selling only about 2,000 copies, ranking at #58. Because of the limited print, however, it has become extremely valuable and rare to the fans. Younha was also chosen to sing the ending theme to the anime \"Jyu Oh Sei\". \"Tewo Tsunaide\" only did slightly better than \"My Lover\", peaking at #50.\nYounha began to compose her own music. The song \"Kaerimichi\" released on \"My Lover\" is the first song released for which she wrote the lyrics and composed the music for. In addition, she composed the music for the song \"homegirl\", the B-side released on \"Te wo Tsunaide\".\n\"Imaga Daisuki\" was released, with more live performances than \"Te wo Tsunaide\", and a tie-in. It seemed that Younha has a bigger budget on this single. It did significantly worse, as her second worst ranking single, at #71. \"Imaga Daisuki\" was also used as an opening song for the animation Jang Geum's Dream while the b-track \"Inori\" was used for the animation's ending song.\nYounha released a digital Korean single titled \"Audition\". The single includes \"Audition (Time 2 Rock)\" and \"Waiting (\uae30\ub2e4\ub9ac\ub2e4)\". Although it was released as a digital single, very limited hard copies of the single were available as well. Many performances for this song were shown on Korean TV, unusual for Younha as her last appearance on TV was with her single \"Touch.\" Much promotion occurred for this single and it helped for a long charting life for \"Audition\", lasting well over 3 months in all the Korean charts. She stayed in Korea during this release, as well as January.\nYounha was once again chosen to be an anime theme singer for \"Kiba\". The song \"Hakanaku Tsuyoku\" was used as the second opening for the show. The single was released on 17 January 2007. This single, unlike her other singles, has only 3 tracks. Surprisingly, this single appeared on the Top 20 Daily Charts for exactly one day, at #16. The Weekly rank was at an above-average #36, but sales were only slightly better. This single did not have a PV because Younha was in Korea during the month before and most likely January as well.\n2007: Great Success in Korea &amp; A Possible Return to Japan.\n\uace0\ubc31\ud558\uae30 \uc88b\uc740 \ub0a0 (The Perfect Day to Say I Love You) Era.\nExactly two months after \"Hakanaku Tsuyoku\", Younha went back to her home country to release her first Korean Album entitled \"\uace0\ubc31\ud558\uae30 \uc88b\uc740 \ub0a0\" (Go Baek Ha Gi Jo Eun Nal, translated \"The Perfect Day to Say I Love You\" or literally translated \"Good Day to Confess\"). She recorded a MV for the third track \"\ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 486\" (Bi Mil Bun Ho 486, translated \"Password 486\") which stars fellow Stam artist Yoon Ji Hoo. The video featured many image changes for Younha which include her first ever kiss. The album also features a collaboration with Wheesung.\nWith the single welcomed well into the market, Younha proceeded to release her Korean debut album. The album received excellent success, peaking at #1 on the charts. The first song to be promoted from the album was \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 486 (Bi Mil Bun Ho 486, translated \"Password 486\"). She won the SBS Inkigayo Mutizen award twice for Secret Number 486. This song was also well received by the Korean audience.

Sometimes their rules were more strict than those St Benedict had given. They also went back to manual labour, especially work in the fields.

Hughes was one of the writers and artists whose work was called the Harlem Renaissance.\nHughes grew up as a poor boy from Missouri, the descendant of African people who had been taken to America as slaves. At that time, the term used for African-Americans was \"negro\" which means a person with black skin. Most \"negroes\" did not remember or think about their link with the people of Africa, even though it was a big influence on their culture and, in particular, their music. Hughes was unusual for his time, because he went back to West Africa to understand more about his own culture. Through his poetry, plays, and stories, Hughes helped other black Americans to see themselves as part of a much bigger group of people, so that now the term \"African-American\" is used with pride.\nHughes became a famous writer, but all his life he remembered how he started out, and he helped and encouraged many other struggling writers.\nLife.\nChildhood.\nLangston Hughes was born on February 1, 1902 in Joplin, Missouri. His parents were James Hughes and Carrie Langston Hughes who was a teacher. Langston's father, James Hughes, was so upset about the racism towards African-Americans that he left his family and moved to Mexico. During his childhood, Hughes was cared for by his grandmother, in Lawrence, Kansas while his mother worked to support the family. Langston's grandmother was a great story teller. She told stories that made him feel proud to be an African-American.\nAfter his grandmother died, Hughes and his mother moved about 12 times until settling in Cleveland, and then, as a teenager went to live in Lincoln, Illinois with his mother, who had remarried. He was often left alone because his mother was at work. Even though his childhood was difficult and had lots of changes, he was able to use these things in the poetry that he started to write while he was at school. He never forgot the stories of his grandmother and tried to help other African-Americans when they were having problems. These were the people that he later wrote about in his own stories.\nWhen Hughes went to school in Lincoln, there were only two African-American children in the class. The teacher talked to them about poetry. She said that what a poem needed most was rhythm. Langston later said that he had rhythm in his blood because, \"as everyone knows\", \"all\" African-Americans have rhythm. The children made him the \"class poet\".\nAt high school in Cleveland, Ohio, Langston learned to love reading. He loved the poetry of the American poets Paul Laurence Dunbar and Carl Sandburg. He wrote articles for the school newspaper, he edited the school yearbook and he wrote his first short stories and plays.\nHughes' father and Columbia University.\nWhen Langston Hughes was 17, he went to spend some time with his father in Mexico. He was so unhappy while he was there that he thought about committing suicide. Hughes could not understand how his father felt. He said: \"I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much!\"\nHughes later wrote this poem: \nWhen he was finished at high school in Lincoln in 1920, he went back to Mexico, to ask his father to pay for him to go to university. Hughes' father was a lawyer and a wealthy landowner. He could afford to send his son to university but he made difficulties about it. He said that Hughes could only go to university if he went overseas and studied engineering. Hughes wanted to go to a university in the US. After a time, they made an agreement that he should go to Columbia University but study engineering, not an arts degree. He went to Columbia in 1921 but left in 1922, partly because of the racism in the university.\nAdult life.\nUntil 1926 Hughes did many different types of work. In 1923 he went as a crewman on the ship \"S.S.Malone\" and went to West Africa and Europe. He left the ship and stayed for a short time in Paris where he joined several other African-Americans who were living there. In November 1924, Hughes returned to the U.S. to live with his mother in Washington, D.C.. In 1925 he got a job as an assistant to Carter G. Woodson who worked with the \"Association for the Study of African American Life and History\". Hughes did not enjoy his work because he did not have enough time to write, so he left and got a job as a \"busboy\", wiping tables and washing dishes at a hotel. Hughes is sometimes called \"The Busboy Poet\". Meanwhile, some of his poems were published in magazines and were being collected together for his first book of poetry. While he was working at the hotel he met the poet Vachel Lindsay, who helped to make Hughes known as a new African-American poet.\nIn 1926 Hughes began studying at Lincoln University, Pennsylvania. He had help from patrons, Amy Spingarn, who gave him $300 and \"Godmother\" Charlotte Osgood Mason. Hughes graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1929 and became a Doctor of Letters in 1943. He was also given an honorary doctorate by Howard University. For the rest of his life, except when he travelled to the Caribbean or West Indies, Hughes lived in Harlem, New York.\nLangston Hughes sometimes went out with women, but he never married. People who have studied his life and poetry are sure that he was homosexual. In the 1930s it was harder to be open about being gay than it is nowadays. His poetry has lots of symbols which are used by other homosexual writers. Hughes thought that men who had very dark skin were particularly beautiful. It seems from his poetry that he was in love with an African-American man. He also wrote a story which might tell of his own experience. \"Blessed Assurance\" is the story of a father's anger because his son is \"queer\" and acts like a girl.\nHughes' life and work were an important part of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, alongside those Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, Richard Bruce Nugent, and Aaron Douglas, who together started a magazine \"Fire!! Devoted to Younger Negro Artists\". Hughes and these friends did not always agree with the ideas of some of the other African-American writers who were also part of the \"Harlem Renaissance\" because they thought their ideas were Middle class and that they treated others who had darker skin, less education and less money with discrimination. All his life, Hughes never forgot the lessons that he learned about poor and uneducated African-Americans in the stories that his grandmother told.\nIn 1960, the \"NAACP\" awarded Hughes the \"Spingarn Medal\" for \"distinguished achievements by an African American\". Hughes became a member of the \"National Institute of Arts and Letters\" in 1961. In 1973, an award was named after him, the \"Langston Hughes Medal\", awarded by the City College of New York.\nHughes became a famous American poet, but he was always ready to help other people, particularly young black writers. He was worried that many young writers hated themselves, and expressed these feelings to the world. He tried to help people feel pride, and not worry about the prejudice of other people. He also tried to help young African-Americans not to express hatred and prejudice towards white Americans.\nHughes wrote: \nDeath.\nOn May 22, 1967, Hughes died in New York City at the age of 65 after having surgery for prostate cancer. His ashes are buried under the floor of the \"Langston Hughes Auditorium\" in the \"Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\" in Harlem. Over his ashes is a circle with an African design called \"Rivers.\" At the centre of the design are words from a poem by Hughes: \"\"My soul has grown deep like the rivers.\""}

This means that every place can be specified by a set of three numbers, called coordinates. \nA full circle can be divided into 360 degrees (or 360\u00b0); this was first done by the Babylonians; Ancient Greeks, like Ptolemy later extended the theory.\nToday, degrees are divided further. There are minutes, and seconds; 1 minute (or 1') in this context is 1/60 of a degree; 1 second (or 1\") is 1/60 of a minute.\nThe first concept needed is called \"latitude\" (Lat, or the Greek symbol \"phi\", formula_1). For it, the Earth is cut up into 180 circles, from the Equator at 0\u00b0. The poles are at 90\u00b0, the North Pole is at 90\u00b0 N(orth), the South Pole is at 90\u00b0 S(outh). Places with the same latitude are on a circle, around the Earth.\nThe other concept is called \"longitude\" (Long, or the Greek symbol \"lambda\", formula_2), sometimes referred to as \"meridian\". The 0\u00b0 longitude line (or zero meridian) goes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Greenwich is a part of London. Then lines are drawn in a similar way; the opposite (or \"antipodal\") meridian of Greenwich is considered both 180\u00b0W(est), and 180\u00b0E(ast).\nThe third number is the height, altitude, or depth. This is given with respect to some fixed (usually easily calculable point). One of these is called mean sea level."}

It is a rocket tall, and wide. It has flown 79 times, since its first flight on August 21, 2002. It was developed from the Atlas (missile). Unlike the Space Shuttle, Atlas V is only used once, with a new rocket being built for each flight.\nThe rocket is made of the first stage, a Common Core Booster with an RD-180 engine from Russia. Every Atlas V has this as the first stage. The second stage is called Centaur, and has one/two RL-10 engines from Aerojet Rocketdyne. On top is a wide fairing covering the spacecraft during launch.\nFlights.\nAs of the end of 2018, the Atlas V has made 79 flights. The most famous ones carried the New Horizons, Mars Science Laboratory (which had the Curiosity rover in it), Juno, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter/LCROSS, the Boeing X-37B, the Mars 2020 mission which carried the Perseverance rover and the Mars Helicopter Ingenuity, and in the future, the launch vehicle for Boeing's CST-100 Starliner used for crewed flights to the International Space Station.\nVariants.\nThe Atlas V has a special way of naming the different kinds. The Atlas V nomenclature for numbering the variants goes like this: The first number says how wide the fairing is. A 400 series Atlas V has a 4-meter wide fairing. A 500 series Atlas V has a 5-meter wide fairing. An Atlas V N22 have no fairing since it will be the launch configuration for the Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. second number says how many strap-on solid rocket boosters the rocket has. An Atlas V 501 has no strap-on boosters, an Atlas V 441 has 4 strap-on boosters, while the Atlas V N22 has two strap-on boosters, which will be the Boeing Starliner launch configuration. The last number says how many engines the Centaur second stage has. All of the Atlas V rockets flown have had only 1 engine on the Centaur, but in the future other Atlas V rockets will have 2 engines on the Centaur upper stage, such as the Atlas V N22 that I frequently mentioned in this article. There is also the HLV which has two of the first stage (Common Core Booster) strapped on like strap-on boosters, but it has never flown."}

{"id": "92432", "revid": "8630", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92432", "title": "Impressionism", "text": "Impressionism is a style of painting which began in France in the late 19th century. Impressionist painting shows life-like subjects painted in a broad, rapid style, with brushstrokes that are easily seen and colours that are often bright. The term 'impressionism' comes from a painting by Claude Monet, which he showed in an exhibition with the name \"Impression, soleil levant\" (\"Impression, Sunrise\"). An art critic called Louis Leroy saw the exhibition and wrote a review in which he said that all the paintings were just \"impressions\". \nImpressionist painters are mostly known for their work in oil paint on canvas. Some impressionist painters also made watercolours and prints. There is also some impressionist sculpture.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century, most artists learned to paint by attending an art school or academy. The academies were very strict about the way that young artists learnt to paint. The popular style of painting was called classicism. Classical paintings were always done inside a studio. They often showed stories from mythology. An artist would prepare for a painting by doing lots of drawings. The paintings were very smoothly and carefully painted.\nAt the same time there were several painters who loved to paint the French landscape and the village people in a realist way, different from Classicism. They would often make small quick paintings out of doors, and then finish them in the studio. These artists include Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste Corot. Edgar Degas wrote in 1883: \"There is one master, Corot. We are nothing in comparison, nothing\". A group of young painters who admired the work of these artists became friends and started painting together. These artists were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and Armand Guillaumin.\nEvery year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the \"Salon de Paris\". In 1863 an artist called Edouard Manet put a picture into the show called \"Lunch on the Grass\" (\"Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe\"). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute! The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude). Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the \"Salon des Refus\u00e9s\" which showed all the pictures that had been \"refused\". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new \"movement\" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to. \nIn 1872 Monet and his friends formed a society called the \"Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\". They began to organize their own art show. In 1874 thirty artists held their first exhibition. The critic Louis Leroy made fun of their work and wrote an article called \"The Exhibition of the Impressionists\". The public who came to the exhibition also began to use this name. The painters themselves soon started to use the name \"Impressionists\" and they have been called by that name ever since. They had eight exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. They paid a dealer called Paul Durand-Ruel to organise exhibitions, and he arranged shows in London and New York. Bit by bit, their paintings became popular. Some of the Impressionists, Monet and Renoir, lived to be old and famous, but others died very poor. The main artists who are called \"Impressionists\" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, Armand Guillaumin, Mary Cassatt, Gustave Caillebotte and Frederic Bazille.\nMany artists worked with the Impressionists for a short time, but then began to try out new ideas. These artists all painted in different ways, but together are called the Post-Impressionists. They include Georges Seurat, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Vincent van Gogh.\nWhile the French Impressionist painters were at work in France, painters in other countries were also beginning to paint outdoors in a broader style. Eventually the Impressionist style spread to many countries across Europe, to North America and Australia. Some artists continued to paint in the Impressionist style right through the 20th century.\nSubject and style.\nImpressionism and photography.\nBefore the time of the Impressionists, many artists worked by painting portraits. Before the invention of the camera, painted portraits were the main way to record a person's \"appearance\" (what they looked like). But by the time the Impressionists started painting, there were many photographers who had studios where people could go to be photographed. As cameras improved, photographers started taking \"snapshots\" of scenery and people outdoors.\nPhotography had two effects on painters. Firstly, it meant that it was much harder for them to live by painting portraits. Many artists became very poor. Secondly, the image taken by a camera often has interesting angles and viewpoints that are not usually painted by artists. Impressionist painters were able to learn from photographs. Many Impressionist paintings make the viewer feel as if they were right there, looking at the scene through the eyes of the artist.\nSubjects.\nImpressionist painters did not paint from their imagination, from literature, history or mythology like most other painters of the 19th century. They painted what they saw in the world around them: the town where they lived, the landscape where they went on holiday, their family, their friends, their studios and the things that were around their home. Sometimes they were \"commissioned\" (given a job) to paint a portrait of someone.\nImpressionist painters liked to paint \"ordinary\" things that were part of everyday life. They painted women doing the washing and ironing, ballet dancers doing exercises, horses getting ready for a race and a bored-looking waitress serving a customer. Nobody, before the Impressionists, had ever thought that these subjects were interesting enough to paint.\nEven though many Impressionist artists painted people, they are thought of mainly for their landscape painting. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with doing some drawings or quick painted sketches outdoors and then making grand pictures in the studio. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with painting the shape of the land, the buildings and trees. They wanted to capture the light and the weather.\nTechnique.\nThe Impressionist painters looked for a \"technique\" (a way of doing something) to paint landscapes that showed the light and the weather. The light and the weather change all the time. The light of the sun on the landscape changes every minute as the Earth turns. Impressionist painters looked at the works of earlier French artists such as Camille Corot and Gustave Courbet. Courbet often took his paints outdoors and made quick coloured sketches that he could then use to make large paintings in his studio. The Impressionist painters were more interested in the sketches than the finished paintings. \nAnother artist, Eugene Boudin, used to sit on the beach at Deauville with his oil paints, and make quick paintings of the people on holiday. They would sometimes buy his paintings as souvenirs.\nClaude Monet met Boudin and learnt that the only way to \"capture\" the way that a landscape looked at a particular time was to paint small pictures, very quickly, and without bothering to mix the paints up to make nice smooth even colours. Impressionist painters would use big brushstrokes of different bright colours and let them get mixed up on the canvas, instead of carefully mixing them up on a palette first. By painting in this way, without bothering with the details, Impressionist painters capture a realistic \"impression\" of a the world that they saw around them.\nSome of the things that they painted were: snow gently falling over a town, mist rising on a river in the pink morning light, people walking through a field of wheat with bright red poppies growing in it, sunlight dappling through leaves onto people dancing, a train sending up clouds of smoke in a big railway station, and water lillies floating on a pool under drooping willows.\nMost Impressionist landscape paintings are small, so that the artist could carry them outdoors. Some artists, particularly Claude Monet, would take several canvases, and as the day went on and the light changed, he would put down one and take up another. He rented a room from which he could see Rouen Cathedral so that he could paint it from the window at different times of day. Monet also did a series of \"Haystack\" paintings, showing them standing in the field from different angles and in all sorts of weather, bright sunshine, morning frost and snow. Paintings that are done outdoors are called \"plein air\" paintings. The Impressionist painters often used to go out together on painting trips, so there are many pictures that can be compared.\nOther impressionist art forms.\nThe term \"impressionism\" has been used for other forms of art, such as writing and music. Octave Mirbeau is often described as an impressionist writer. In 1887, music critics said the works of Claude Debussy were impressionist. Later, other composers were also described as impressionist, including Maurice Ravel, Paul Dukas, Erik Satie and Albert Roussel.\nGallery of impressionist paintings.\nClick on each image to enlarge it, to see the way each artist has used brush-strokes and colour."}

These were used with massed troop formations. One of the more notable of these was the \"bayonet charge\". This was an attack by a formation of infantrymen with fixed bayonets, usually over short distances. It was to overrun enemy strong points, capture artillery batteries, or break up enemy troop formations.\nWith the use of the bayonet, the pike was no longer used because infantry could now defend themselves from cavalry without sacrificing firepower per man. The Russian Army used the bayonet frequently during the Napoleonic wars. A Russian saying coined by Russian General Alexander Suvorov was \"The bullet is foolish, the bayonet wise\".

He was the most important English composer of madrigals. He studied the madrigals by Italian composers and created the tradition of the English madrigal, a tradition that became extremely popular, but which only lasted about 30 years.\nLife.\nMorley\u2019s father was a brewer who lived in Norwich, so it is likely that Morley was born there. He may have been a choirboy in Norwich Cathedral. We know that in 1583 he got the job of organist there. In a book he published later in his life he said that William Byrd was his master. If this means that he had lessons from Byrd he must have travelled away from Norwich. In 1588 he got a degree from Oxford, and soon afterwards he became an organist at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\nIn 1588 Nicholas Yonge published a book called \"Musica transalpina\". It was a collection of Italian madrigals with words translated into English. Soon after this Morley started to publish his own madrigals. In 1592 he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.\nIn London Morley lived near Shakespeare. We do not know whether the two men worked together, but Morley did set Shakespeare\u2019s words \"It was a lover and his lass\" from \"As You Like It\". We do not know whether it was ever used in a performance of Shakespeare's play. It is quite possible, because Morley was well-known.\nFrom 1593 onwards Morley published a great deal of music and also made a lot of money out of music publishing, both of his own and other composers\u2019 music.\nIt is thought that Morley died in October 1602.\nHis music.\nMorley wrote sacred music as well as madrigals. His church music is strongly influenced by William Byrd. \nHis madrigals are his most important works. They are often very lively and have tunes that are easy to sing. One of his best known madrigals is called \"Now is the Month of Maying\". He started by using the Italian style and changed it to make it sound English. The madrigals of Thomas Weelkes and John Wilbye are usually more serious. \nAs well as madrigals, Morley wrote music for instruments, including keyboard music. Some of his pieces are in the famous collection called \"Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\"). He also wrote music for the typically English combination of two viols, flute, lute, cittern and bandora.\nMorley wrote a book about music theory called \"Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke\". It was published in 1597 and was read by many people for two centuries after his death. It tells us a lot about how music was performed in Morley\u2019s"}

He created and published his works himself, but his larger works were mostly commissioned work to be sold.\nHe also made prints to be used as cards, wallpaper, coats of arms, designs for other artists and designs for stained or painted glass. He also painted a table top (now in the Louvre ) for Cardinal Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz.\nBeham mostly engraved pictures of peasants and scenes from myths or history, sometimes with erotic scenes as well. Since he was working at the same time as D\u00fcrer, the most recognised artist at the time, one of his early woodcuts, \"Head of Christ\", was thought to have been done by D\u00fcrer. Beham also worked with his brother Barthel, and shared ideas with him. Later, he re-drew some of D\u00fcrer's works like gus Melancholia of 1539.\nBooks.\nAfter publishing a book about drawing horses, for which he was exiled, he wrote a book on drawing the human figure. His book was mostly just a simplified book of D\u00fcrer's own books, but his book was easier to use and cheaper than D\u00fcrer's books, so artists preferred to buy his."}

He was supported financially by a rich family called Kytson. The Kytsons were very musical and had lots of musical instruments and sheet music in their house. It is thought that he went with Elizabeth Cornwallis to Hengrave Hall near Bury St. Edmunds in around 1594 when she married Sir Thomas Kytson the Younger. When Elizabeth died, Wilbye moved to Colchester where he lived with Elizabeth\u2019s youngest daughter with whom he had a long friendship. When Wilbye died he was quite rich.\nHis music.\nA book of madrigals by him appeared in 1598 and a second in 1608. It is often called the finest book of English madrigals. There were a total of 64 madrigals in these two books.\nWilbye was influenced by Morley\u2019s madrigals, and also learned directly from the madrigals of Italian composers such as Alfonso Ferrabosco. He wrote many madrigals which have become extremely popular, including \"Weep, weep o mine eyes\" and \"Draw on, sweet night\". He was very good at making his music match the meaning of the words. He often used a mixture of major and minor modes."}

It was one of the three main branches of Islam, along with Shia Islam and Sunni Islam. Though, the branch has no followers today, the Ibadi movement is seen as a moderate current demonization of Shurat Islam. However, Ibadis reject themselves being Shuratis.\nInitially, Muslims were divided into two groups, Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. After caliph Uthman's death, Ali and Muawiya I were having a war. At this time, the Shurati Muslims emerged, who did not pledge allegiance to Ali or Muawiya I. Rather than allegiance, Shurati Muslims decided to attack Ali and Muawiya I's followers.\nSometimes, the term \"Kharijite\" (or \"Neo-Kharijite\") is also used for some Islamic terrorist groups. Examples of such groups are the Groupe islamique arm\u00e9 in Algeria, or the Takfir wal-Hijra in Egypt."}

He is one of the greatest composers of madrigals of his time as well as great composer of church music.\nLife.\nThomas Weelkes was baptised in the little village church of Elsted in Sussex on 25 October, 1576. His father may have been the rector at that church. There is no information about Weelkes' childhood.\nWe know that in 1597 he published his first volume of madrigals, and that he was a young man then. After working for a short time at the house of Edward Darcye, he got the job of organist at Winchester College. He was paid 13s 4d (almost 67p in modern money) per quarter (i.e. every three months), but was given food and somewhere to live. He stayed there for two or three years. \nDuring his time in Winchester Weelkes composed two more volumes of madrigals, published in 1598 and 1600. He got his B. Mus. Degree from New College, Oxford in 1602, and moved to Chichester to take up the job of organist and choir master at the Cathedral.. He was also a lay clerk at the Cathedral, and was paid \u00a315 2s 4d (\u00a315.11 in modern money) in addition to having food and lodgings. The next year he married Elizabeth Sandham, who came from a rich family. They had three children.\nWeelkes' fourth and final volume of madrigals, published in 1608, has a title page where he says that he was a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. However, his name does not appear in the records at the Chapel Royal, so it is likely that he was only there for a short time until someone else was found for the job.\nIn later years Weelkes got into trouble with the Chichester Cathedral authorities because of his heavy drinking and bad behaviour. In 1609 he was in trouble because he was absent from work. In 1616 he was in trouble again for swearing. In the end he lost his job because he was drunk at the organ and used bad language during the service. However, he got his job back, but his behaviour was still bad.\nThomas Weelkes died in London in 1623, a year after his wife died. He was buried in St Bride\u2019s Church, Fleet Street, London. In Chichester Cathedral there is a memorial stone to him.\nMusic.\nThomas Weelkes is best known for his vocal music, especially his madrigals and church music. Weelkes wrote more Anglican services than any other important composer of the time, mostly for evensong. Many of his anthems are verse anthems, which would have suited the small choir he was writing for at Chichester Cathedral.\nWeelkes was friends with the madrigalist Thomas Morley. When Morley died in 1602, Weelkes wrote an anthem called \"A Remembrance of my Friend Thomas Morley\", (also known as \"Death hath Deprived Me\".) Weelkes\u2019s madrigals are very chromatic and use counterpoint and unusual rhythms."}

In the early Middle Ages, the meaning changed and the word was used for one of the highest officials of the Catholic Church in the pope's service and also for one of the big nobles of the Holy Roman Empire, who was then named Count Palatine. The word paladin was also used in 19th century Hungary and in the German Empire and United Kingdom during the early 20th century.\nIn medieval literature, the paladins or Twelve Peers were known in the Matter of France as the retainers of Charlemagne. Because of the way that this word was used in books, paladin was then known to be a knight with honor.\nHistory.\nAncient Rome.\nThe paladins of the imperial guard were named after the Scholae Palatinae.\nIn the beginning, the word paladin was applied to the Chamberlains and to some soldiers guarding the palace of the Roman emperor. In Constantine's time, the word was also used for the best infantry of the army, the Praetorian Guard, that might guard the Roman Emperor during wars.\nHoly Roman Empire.\nAfter the Middle Ages, the word palatine was put onto many different people of power across Europe. The most important of these was the \"comes palatinus\", the count palatine, who in Merovingian and Carolingian times, was an official of the lords' household and court of law.\nDuring the 800s, Carolingean rule came to an end and the title of Holy Roman emperor with it. About a century later, the title was made alive again by Otto I, though the new empire was now centered in Germany rather than France. The term palatine is found again under Charles IV, but they were less powerful than the previous palatines.\nModern usage.\nIn the early days of England, the word \"palatinate\", or county palatine, was also used in counties of lords who could use powers normally used by the crown.\nIn Britain and Germany, paladin was an official rank and was a very good title for one in the service of the emperors. It was a Knight with additional honours, they were allowed to use powers normally used by the crown.\nPresent day.\nThe word \"paladin\" is still used to describe a good, heroic person, or a defender of a good cause.\nSome role playing games now use paladins as a character class that you can choose when starting a new game."}
