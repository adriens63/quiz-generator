To produce power, engines must burn a fuel. This creates a lot of heat. If the heat is not removed, the engine will overheat and stop running. The radiator is connected to the engine with hoses.\nA liquid flows into the engine. Heat is moved from the engine to the liquid. The heat moves because of Newton's Law of Cooling. This law says that heat will move from something hot to something cooler.\nThe liquid then moved into the radiator. The radiator has many small tubes for the liquid to flow through. Air moves around to the tubes to cool them. This cools the liquid. The liquid then return to the engine. This is a closed loop.\nIndoor heating.\nMany houses are located in areas that get cold. Heat needs to be added to the house so the people are comfortable. A radiator is placed in a room to add heat to the room. The heat is created by a furnace. A heating radiator works just like a cooling radiator. The heat from the furnace moves to the radiator. The room is cooler than the radiator. The heat moves from the radiator into the room to warm the room."}

For this crime he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. He spent 32 years in prison before being released on parole in July 2008.\nBackground.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 was born in Gorica, a village in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia, and finished high school in Imotski. At the age of 20, he emigrated to Vienna. In Vienna, three years later, in 1969, he met the American student, Julienne Eden Schultz, who was studying German there and who soon thereafter became involved in the activities of the Croatian emigration. In coordination with Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107, she and a friend traveled to Zagreb and threw anti-Yugoslav leaflets on Republic Square, after which they were arrested and imprisoned. After release, Julienne returned to Vienna and in 1972, Julienne and Zvonko married in Frankfurt. Later they moved to the U.S. where he became a member and leader of the Croatian terrorist group called Croatian National Resistance.\nHijacking and bombing.\nA group of Croatian terrorists made up of Zvonko and his wife, Julienne Bu\u0161i\u0107, Petar Matani\u0107, Frane Pe\u0161ut and Slobodan Vla\u0161i\u0107 hijacked a commercial Trans World Airlines plane on September 10, 1976. It was Boeing 727 Flight 355, heading from New York City to Chicago. The mastermind of this terrorist group, Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 delivered a sealed letter to the pilot, Captain Carey. The letter informed the Captain that the airplane had been hijacked. It said that the hijackers had five gelignite bombs, and that a bomb had been planted in a locker across from the Commodore Hotel on 42nd Street in New York with the further instructions that the U.S. authorities should follow. The hijackers demanded heading the plane in the direction of London. Their ultimate demands, given in the instructions, were:\nThe terrorists' first demand was that thousands of copies of a \"Declaration of the Croatian Liberation Forces\" be scattered from the air over New York, Chicago, Montreal, Paris, London, and the site of a popular festival in Croatia. This declaration was written for this purposes by a Croatia's dissident, Bruno Bu\u0161i\u0107.\nThe plane took refueling stop in Montreal, and flew to Paris, France. During the new refueling stop in Newfoundland, the terrorist agreed to release thirty passengers. Bu\u0161i\u0107 reminded Captain Carey that the aircraft could be blown up at any time if the demands were not met and that the passengers released at Newfoundland, if failed to distribute leaflets as ordered, the remaining passengers' fate would be on their consciences.\nIn Paris, the hijackers got information that their demands had been met. So they surrendered to the French police, which extradited them to the United States. During efforts to deactivate the explosives four hours later at the detonation site, American policeman Brian Murray died, and three other officers were wounded.\nTrial, imprisonment, and release.\nZvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 was charged with and convicted of air piracy resulting in death, which carried a mandatory life sentence. Three years after the trial, Judge John Bartels declared Bu\u0161i\u0107 eligible for parole after Dec. 31 1979.\nOn April 17, 1987 Bu\u0161i\u0107 escaped from the Otisville Correctional Institution, a medium-security Federal prison in Orange County, N.Y. Two days later, Bu\u0161i\u0107 was caught and surrendered peacefully.\nOn June 13, 1989, Bartels wrote a letter-opinion to the U.S. Parole Commission, in which he stated that the death of the police officer was partly due to the police's negligence and that he had no recommendation to the Commission nor objection to Bu\u0161i\u0107's release. However, the Commission rejected this parole.\nHis second request for parole was denied in 2006, after service of 30 years, although the others in the group had already been free for at least 17 years. After this parole denial, Croatian government along with the Croatian Helsinki Committee, launched a campaign to secure his release on humanitarian grounds, arguing that Bu\u0161i\u0107 had served out his sentence and therefore should be released.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 spent his last two years of imprisonment at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, transferred there from Allenwood, Pennsylvania.\nCroatian National Resistance (Otpor) idealized Bu\u0161i\u0107es and their gang. Marin Sopta, the former North American Otpor leader, said: \"The Bu\u0161i\u0107es were our heroes. They did more to promote the Croatian cause than anyone else\". Sopta visited Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 regularly when he was serving time in Pennsylvania.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 was granted parole in July 2008 and turned over to immigration authorities for deportation proceedings. A condition of his parole was that he could not return to the U.S.\nReactions on Bu\u0161i\u0107\u2019s release.\nFreeing this terrorist from a life sentence and shipping him to his homeland caused the disgust of relatives of the city cop he murdered more than 30 years ago.\nLt. Terence McTigue, who was blinded in the blast that killed Murray, had spoken against the release of Bu\u0161i\u0107 and his crew at earlier parole hearings but, he said, he was never notified of the last, fateful one. McTigue saw this event as a political favor done for the Croatian government and said, \"It is like killing Brian Murray and injuring me all over again.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) protested Bu\u0161i\u0107's release without hearing from the victims, to Attorney General Michael Mukasey.\nZvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 had been the object of suspicion of many of those who looked into the La Guardia bombing which happened on December 29 1975. The suspicion was raised by Lt. McTigue, Edwin T. Dreher, who, as a deputy police chief at the time, was put in charge of solving this case, Frank McDarby, a detective who interrogated Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 in an F.B.I. office 33 years ago; the crime writer Kevin F. McMurray, who spoke with Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 for three hours in 1997 in a visitors\u2019 room at the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa.; and Robert K. Tanenbaum, a former prosecutor from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Each of them reviewed this case anew and wondered anew if Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 escaped punishment for one of the biggest unsolved terrorist acts in the USA. Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 denied any involvement in the La Guardia bombing. But Lt. McTigue was struck by the similarities in the two bombings:\n\"Both bombs were in a public locker in a transportation facility, a few days after a holiday, and both were large and heavy,\" Mr. McTigue said. He noted that both devices utilized dynamite and \"a 9-volt battery, possibly for a lantern.\"\nDeath.\nBu\u0161i\u0107 died by suicide on 1 September 2013 with firearm in his apartment near Zadar, Croatia. He was discovered by his wife Julienne."}

Instrument ports came out of the surface of the sphere. It also had various metallic emblems with the Soviet coat of arms.\nInstruments.\nLuna 1 had radio equipment, a tracking transmitter and a telemetering system for communication with Earth. The spacecraft carried several scientific devices too. These included a magnetometer, a device for measuring magnetic fields, a scintillation counter, a device for detecting high energy particles and a geiger counter, a device for measuring radiation. Luna 1 also carried a micrometeorite detector and other equipment.\nMission.\nThe space probe was launched on January 2, 1959 at Baikonur Cosmodrome by a SS-6 Sapwood rocket. The launch was successful and Luna 1 became the first man-made object ever to reach the escape velocity of the Earth.\nOn January 3, 1959, the spacecraft released a cloud of sodium gas so that astronomers could track the probe and also to serve as an experiment on the behaviour of gas in space.\nLuna 1 was intended to impact the Moon's surface. However, on January 4, 1959, it passed within 5995 km of the Moon and began to orbit the Sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars, where it is still orbiting now, on a 450 day orbit.

He also drew cartoons.\nPersonal life.\nLyonel Feininger's father was the German violinist Karl Feininger. His mother was the American singer Elizabeth Feininger. Feininger grew up in New York City.\nFeininger married Clara F\u00fcrst, the daughter of the painter Gustav F\u00fcrst. They had two daughters. He also had several children with Julia Berg whom he later married. His sons, Andreas Feininger and T. Lux Feininger, both became artists. Andreas was a photographer and T. Lux became a photographer and a painter.\nArtwork.\nHe moved to Berlin in 1887 to study at the K\u00f6nigliche Akademie Berlin under Ernst Hancke. Then he studied at art schools in Berlin with Karl Schlabitz, and in Paris with sculptor Filippo Colarossi. He started as a caricaturist in 1894 for several German, French and American magazines. These included \"Harper's Round Table\", \"Harper's Young People\", \"Humoristische Bl\u00e4tter\", \"Lustige Bl\u00e4tter\", \"Das Narrenschiff\", \"Berliner Tageblatt\" and \"Ulk\".\nIn February of 1906, James Keeley, editor of The \"Chicago Tribune\" traveled to Germany. He was looking for artists to draw cartoons for his newspaper. He recruited Feininger to draw two comic strips (\"The Kin-der-Kids\" and \"Wee Willie Winkie's World\") for the \"Chicago Tribune\". People liked the comic strips for their humor and experimental drawing style. Fenininger also worked as a commercial caricaturist for 20 years for various newspapers and magazines in both the USA and Germany. Later, Art Spiegelman wrote in \"The New York Times Book Review,\" that Feininger's comics have \u201cachieved a breathtaking formal grace unsurpassed in the history of the medium.\u201d\nFeininger's art was chosen to be a part of the annual Berlin Secession art show in the years 1901 through 1903.\nFeininger started to work as a fine artist at the age of 36. He was a member of the \"Berliner Sezession\" in 1909. He was associated with expressionist group Die Br\u00fccke, the Novembergruppe, Gruppe 1919, the Blaue Reiter circle and The Blue Four. When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Germany in 1919, Feininger became the master artist in charge of the printmaking workshop. He designed the cover for the Bauhaus 1919 manifesto: an expressionist woodcut 'cathedral'. He taught at the Bauhaus for several years. Among the students who attended his workshops were Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack (German/Australian, 1893\u20131965), Hans Friedrich Grohs (German 1892 - 1981) and Margarete Koehler-Bittkow (German/American, 1898\u20131964)\nIn 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. Feininger's wife was partly Jewish, and they decided to leave Germany. The Nazi Party declared his work to be \"degenerate.\" They moved to America after his work was exhibited in the 'degenerate art' (\"Entartete Kunst\") in 1936, but before the 1937 exhibition in Munich. After moving to the United States, Feininger taught at Black Mountain College.\nOther work.\nIn addition to drawing, Feininger created art with painted toy figures being photographed in front of drawn backgrounds.\nFeininger also worked sometimes as a pianist and composer. Music historians still keep several of Feininger's piano compositions and fugues for organ."}

These gifts included works by Cezanne and Picasso. She is also famous for being the model for portraits. Two paintings of her won the Archibald Prize; William Dobell's painting in 1948, and Ben Quilty's in 2011. She was described by Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of Australia, as a great artist and a true Australian national treasure.\nShe grew up on sugarcane farms in Queensland, and her artistic talent was noticed at school. Her teachers convinced her parents she should study art at the Brisbane Technical College. She then moved to Sydney and studied art at the East Sydney Technical College. She held the first of her 90 exhibitions in 1948. Many of her paintings were of things around her home such as flowers and bowls of fruit.

It was first awarded in 1921. The money for the prize was left by J.\u00a0F.\u00a0Archibald, the editor of \"The Bulletin\" magazine who died in 1919. The prize is awarded by the Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales for the best portrait of a person famous in Art, Letters, Science or Politics. The artist must have lived in Australia or New Zealand for at least one year. The Archibald Prize is awarded every year. Since 2015 the prize has been worth A$100,000.\nHistory.\nThe first prize awarded in 1921 was worth \u00a3400. Early winners included William Beckwith McInnes, John Longstaff, and William Dargie. Dargie's painting which won in 1942 had been painted when he was an official war artist during World War 2 in Syria. The ship carrying the painting back to Australia sank and the painting was underwater for some time.\nIn 1946 the trustees selected works for instead of displaying all the entries. Less than a third of the entries were chosen for exhibition.\nDargie also won the 1956 prize with a portrait of Australia's celebrated Aboriginal painter Albert Namatjira. The portrait was done while Albert Namatjira was visiting Sydney from the Central Desert.\nIn 1964 and 1980 the prize was not awarded as there were no works that the trustees thought were good enough.\nThere are usually about 700 entries in the Archibald Prize, but only about 40 are selected as finalists for display. Some of the winning artists have had to enter for many years before they made the final display of paintings.\nPortraits in 2006 included a painting of one of The Wiggles by Patrick Whiteley\nactor Steve Bisley by Bronwyn Graham,\nactor Garry McDonald by Paul Jackson,\npolitician Steve Bracks by Garry Anderson,\nactor Cate Blanchett by McLean Edwards,\nactor Ernie Dingo by Marie Klement,\ncricketer Dennis Lillee by Melinda Mackay,\nmusician and TV personality Wilbur Wilde by Phillip Howe,\nPeter Slipper by Wayne Strickland. The 2010 prize winner was Sam Leach with his painting of musician Tim Minchin.\nControversy.\nThe prize has often been the centre of argument and there have even been several court cases. The most famous case was in 1943 when William Dobell's winning painting of artist Joshua Smith was claimed to be a caricature and not a portrait.\nThe Archibald is one of the few art prizes in which the artist's signature is covered up. The judges do not know who did the paintings. This is to try and stop the judges, some of whom are artists, from simply giving the prize to their friends and not the best painting.\nMax Meldrum criticised the Archibald Prize winner in 1938, saying that women could not be expected to paint as well as men. Nora Heysen was the first woman to win the Archibald Prize, with a portrait of Madame Elink Schuurman, the wife of the Consul General for the Netherlands.\nIn 1953 several art students including John Olsen protested William Dargie's winning portrait. It was the seventh time he had won the prize. One protester tied a sign around her dog which said \"Winner Archibald Prize \u2013 William Doggie\". Dargie went on to win the prize again in 1956.\nAfter Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was dismissed he refused to sit for the traditional portrait which is done of Australian Prime Ministers. He said that the 1972 Archibald Prize winning portrait by Clifton Pugh be used instead. This is now on display at New Parliament House in Canberra.\nIn 1975, John Bloomfield's portrait of Tim Burstall was rejected because it had been painted from a photograph, and not from life. The prize was then given to Kevin Connor. John Bloomfield took action in 1981 saying that the winner that year, Eric Smith had not painted his subject from life. In 1983 John Bloomfield went to court to try to get back the 1975 prize but was unsuccessful. In 1995 the application form of the Archibald Prize was changed to make it clear that the subject must be painted from life.\nIn 1985, control of the trust was given to the Art Gallery of New South Wales after a court case. In 1997 the painting of the Bananas in Pyjamas television characters by Evert Ploeg not allowed because it was not a painting of a person. Hundreds of portraits each year are not accepted as finalists.\nThe 2000 Archibald winner, Adam Cullen, took action against the American Broadcasting Company who had used his painting, \"Portrait of David Wenham\", in a television commercial.\nIn 2002, head packer Steve Peters chose a painting of himself by Dave Machin as a possible winner for the Packing Room Prize. It did not win, but it was on display outside the Archibald exhibition. After this, portraits of the head packer were no longer allowed.\nIn 2004 Craig Ruddy's portrait of actor David Gulpilil, won both the main prize and the \"People's Choice\" award. It was challenged because it was a charcoal sketch rather than a painting. The claim was dismissed in the Supreme Court in June 2006.\nIn 2008 Sam Leach's portrait of himself as Hitler made the front page of Melbourne's newspaper \"The Age\". This started a national argument about of his choice of subject matter. The prize money was also changed to $50 000.\nThe prize money is now currently $100,000.\nAdditional categories.\nSince 1988 there have been two extra awards added to the Archibald prize event. In 1991 the Packing Room Prize was established. The staff who receive the portraits and put them in the gallery, vote for their choice of winner. Although the prize is said to be awarded by the staff, the gallery's head storeman \u2013 , Steve Peters \u2013 holds 51% of the vote. The other award is the Peoples Choice Award in which votes from the viewing public are collected to find a winner. This award also comes with a prize of $2,500. To date, there has never been a matching Archibald Prize winner and a Packing Room Prize chosen in the same year, but there were two Peoples Choice Awards given to Archibald Prize winners in 1988 and 2004.\nTwice there has been a matching Packing prize winner and Peoples choice award (neither won the main prize). The first was Paul Newton's portrait of Roy Slaven and HG Nelson in 2001, and second was Jan Williamson's portrait of singer/songwriter Jenny Morris the following year in 2002.\nAssociated prizes.\nThe Archibald is held at the same time as the Sir John Sulman Prize, the Wynne Prize, the recent Australian Photographic Portrait Prize and was held with the Dobell Prize before 2003. The Archibald Prize is the next richest portrait prize in Australia, after the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. However, the Archibald is the only artist's prize that receives much attention in the general press. Part of the reason is probably that many of the paintings feature well known Australians such as actors, sportspeople, and politicians, making the art more accessible than other genres. It is also longer running with a richer tradition than the newer established portrait prizes.\nIn 1978 Brett Whiteley won the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes all in the same year, the only time this has happened. It was his second win for the Archibald and the other prizes as well.\nSome paintings which do not make the Archibald Prize finalists are shown at the S. H. Ervin Gallery in the Salon des Refus\u00e9s exhibition, which began in 1992.\nThe satirical Bald Archy Prize, supposedly judged by a cockatoo, was started in 1994 at the Coolac Festival of Fun as a parody of the Archibald Prize; it attracted so many visitors that it has moved to Sydney."}

He was the third of seven children to Abel de Jesus Escobar and Hemilda Gaviria. His father was a farmer and his mother an elementary school teacher. Escobar and his family lived in an adobe hut. They had no electricity and no running water. Pablo Escobar and his brother's school once sent them home because they had no shoes and no money to buy them. Pablo Escobar studied political science at a university nearby. He had to stop studying because he could not pay the fees. This was when he began his criminal career. He started to steal gravestones and removed the words from them to resell them. His brother, Roberto Escobar, said that this was not the truth. He said that the gravestones came from cemetery owners whose clients had stopped paying for site care. Escobar then studied for a short time at the University of Antioquia.\nAfter this, Pablo started doing whatever else he could do to make money. He sold illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets. He even stole money from people when they left the bank. At the age of 20, he was already a famous car thief. In the early 1970s, he was a thief and bodyguard. He made $100,000 for kidnapping an executive from Medell\u00edn. Then he entered the drug trade. His next aim was to become a millionaire. Therefore, Escobar worked for the multi-millionaire and smuggler, Alvaro Prieto. Escobar became a millionaire at the age of 22.\nRise to power.\nThe book \"The Accountant's Story\" which Pablo Escobar's brother published, Roberto Escobar, discusses how his brother became rich. It explains how he rose from poverty. The book also says how Escobar became one of the richest men of the world. He led the largest and most successful criminal enterprise in world history. At times, the Medell\u00edn drug cartel was smuggling 15 tons of cocaine a day. This was worth more than half a billion dollars. They sent it to the United States and sold it there. According to Roberto Escobar, Pablo Escobar's accountant, they spent $2,500 a month for buying rubber bands to wrap the stacks of cash. They had more illegal money than they could store in banks. Therefore, they stored the bricks of cash in their warehouses. About 10% were destroyed each year because of rats.\nIn 1975, Escobar started to develop his cocaine trade. He even flew a plane himself several times, mainly between Colombia and Panama. He smuggled a plane load into the United States. Escobar later bought 15 newer and bigger airplanes (including a Learjet) and 6 helicopters. .\nThere were no drug cartels then and only a few drug barons. There was a lot of business for everyone. They bought the cocaine paste in Peru. They refined it in a laboratory in a two-story house in Medell\u00edn. At first, they smuggled the cocaine in old planes. The pilot could earn as much as \u00a3500,000 for each flight depending on how much he could smuggle.\nSoon the demand for cocaine in the United States increased. Escobar started to organize more smuggling ships and routes. He also improved the sale networks in South Florida, California and other parts of the USA. Escobar and Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new drug center in the Bahamas, called Norman's Cay. Lehder and Robert Vesco bought most of the land on the island. This included an airstrip, a harbor, hotels, houses and boats. They also built a warehouse to store the cocaine. From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medell\u00edn Cartel. Escobar bought of land, which included Hacienda Napoles, for several million dollars. He created a zoo, a lake and other things for his family and organization. At one point, about 70 to 80 tons of cocaine were brought from Colombia to the United States every month. At the peak of Escobar's power in the mid-1980s, he sent about 11 tonnes per flight in planes to the United States. In addition to using the planes, Roberto Escobar said he also used two small submarines to transport the massive loads.\nIn 1982, Escobar was elected as a deputy (alternative) representative to the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia's Congress. He was part of the Colombian Liberal Party. During the 1980s, Escobar became known internationally because his drug network became famous. The Medell\u00edn Cartel controlled a large part of the drugs that entered the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The cocaine was mostly from Peru and Bolivia. The Colombian coca was not of best quality. Escobar's product reached many other nations, mostly around the Americas. His network reportedly reached as far as Asia.\nCorruption characterized Escobar's dealings with the Colombian system. He had an effective way of dealing with law enforcements and the government. This is often referred to as \"plata o plomo\" (literally \"silver or lead\"or \"accept money or face bullets\"). This resulted in the deaths of hundreds of individuals. This included civilians, policemen and state officials. At the same time, Escobar bribed many government officials, judges and other politicians. Escobar was responsible for the murder of Colombian presidential candidate Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n. The \"Cartel de Medell\u00edn\" was also involved in a deadly drug war, their enemy was the Cartel de Cali.\nThe Life of Pablo.\nPablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria once said that the cocaine business was \"simple - you bribe someone here, you bribe someone there, and you pay a friendly banker to help you bring the money back.\" In 1989, his Medell\u00edn cartel controlled 80% of the cocaine that was sent to the United States.\nThe United States and Colombian governments saw Escobar as an enemy. At the same time, Escobar was a hero to many people in Medell\u00edn, especially to the poor people as he built houses for them. He was a sports fan, and built football fields and multi-sports courts. He also sponsored children's football teams.\nEscobar was responsible for the construction of many hospitals, schools and churches in western Colombia. This made him popular with the local Roman Catholic Church. He worked hard for his \"Robin Hood\" image. Escobar often gave money to the poor through housing projects and other civic activities. The population of Medell\u00edn often helped Escobar by watching the police. They also hid information from the authorities, and did whatever else they could do to protect him.\nDespite his popular image among Medell\u00edn's community, Escobar was well-known among his business associates to be a calm and sensible partner to deal with. He preferred to use his money before his gun. His brother said that Pablo Escobar knew that money generated more loyalty than fear. Violence was often unnecessary.\nThe Colombian cartels quickly managed to make Colombia the world\u2019s capital for murder with 25,100 violent deaths in 1991 and 27,100 in 1992. Escobar gave money to his hitmen as a reward for killing police officers. 600 officers died this way. Today, other countries, such as Guatemala, South Africa and Venezuela have more murders than Colombia.\nPersonal life.\nIn March 1976 when he was 26, Escobar married Maria Victoria. She was 11 years younger than him. Together they had two children: Juan Pablo and Manuela. Escobar built and lived in a luxurious house with his family. He wanted to construct a Greek-style citadel near it. They began the construction of the citadel but never finished. The ranch, the zoo and the citadel were expropriated by the government. They were given to poor families in the 1990s under a law called \"extinci\u00f3n de dominio\" (domain extinction).\nLa Catedral prison.\nAfter the murder of Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n, a presidential candidate, the administration of C\u00e9sar Gaviria moved against Escobar and the drug cartels. Eventually, the government talked with Escobar. They wanted him to capitulate and to stop all criminal activity.\nEscobar declared an end to a series of previous violence and terrorism, and turned himself in. He was held in what became his own luxurious private prison, \"La Catedral\". Before Escobar gave himself up, the government approved the extradition of Colombian citizens. This was controversial. People suspected that Escobar or other drug lords influenced members of the government.\nEscobar continued his criminal activities. He began to influence the media. The government discovered that Escobar was continuing his criminal activities within La Catedral. They wanted to move Escobar to another prison on July 22, 1992. Escobar's influence allowed him to discover the plan in advance and escape. He was still worried that he could be sent to the United States.\nSearch Bloc and Los Pepes.\nIn 1992, United States Special Forces joined the manhunt for Escobar. They trained and advised a special Colombian police task force, called the Search Bloc. It was created to locate Escobar. Later, as the conflict between Escobar and the governments grew, a group known as \"Los Pepes\" (Los Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar) formed. His rivals and former associates financed it. They wanted to find Escobar. Los Pepes carried out a bloody campaign and more than 300 of Escobar's associates were killed. Also, a lot of his cartel's property was destroyed.\nRumors said that members of the Search Bloc and of the Colombian and the United States intelligence agencies cooperated with \"Los Pepes\". One of the leaders of \"Los Pepes\" was Diego Murillo Bejarano, also known as \"Don Berna\". Before, he was a Medell\u00edn Cartel associate.\nDeath and afterwards.\nThe fight against Escobar ended on December 2, 1993. The police used radio triangulation technology to find Escobar. The United States provided this technology to a Colombian electronic surveillance team. The group was led by Brigadier Hugo Martinez. The team found him hiding in a middle-class barrio in Medell\u00edn. With the permission from authorities, a firefight with Escobar and his bodyguard, Alvaro de Jes\u00fas Agudelo AKA \"El Lim\u00f3n\", happened. They tried to escape by running across the roofs of nearby houses to reach a back street, but both were shot and killed by Colombian National Police. Escobar suffered gunshots to the leg, torso, and the fatal one in his ear. It is not known who actually fired the final shot into Escobar's head. It is also unknown whether this shot was made during the gunfight or as part of possible execution. There is wide speculation about this. Some of the family members believe that Escobar could have committed suicide. His two brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando S\u00e1nchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ears. \"He committed suicide, he did not get killed. During all the years they went after him, he would say to me every day that if he was really cornered without a way out, he would shoot himself through the ears.\" The autopsy showed that there was no stippling pattern found around the ear, which suggested that the shot which killed Escobar was fired from further than an arm's length away.\nAfter Escobar's death and the fragmentation of the Medell\u00edn Cartel, the rival Cali Cartel rose to power.\nExhumation.\nOn October 28, 2006, Escobar's body was exhumed by request of his nephew Nicol\u00e1s Escobar. This was two days after the death of mother Hermilda Gaviria, who opposed the exhumation. Nicol\u00e1s Escobar wanted to verify that the body in the tomb was in fact that of Escobar. Escobar's nephew also collect DNA for a paternity test claim. According to the report by the \"El Tiempo\" newspaper, Escobar's widow Maria Victoria was present recording the exhumation with a video camera.\nVirginia Vallejo's version.\nOn July 4, 2006, Virginia Vallejo, the television news speaker offered information in the trial against former Senator Alberto Santofimio to the Colombian Attorney General Mario Iguaran. Vallejo was romantically involved with Escobar between 1983 and 1987. The Senator was accused of conspiracy in the 1989 murder of Presidential Candidate Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n. Iguaran said that, although Vallejo contacted his office on the 4th, the judge had decided to close the trial on the 9th. This was several weeks before the prospective closing date and, in (Iguaran's) opinion, \"too soon\"."}

The Art Institute owns one of the world's best collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. It also owns important American art, Old Masters, European and American decorative arts, Asian art and modern and contemporary art. The museum is linked with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. James Cuno is its Director and President. Its buildings have one million square feet (92,903,040 m2) of space. It is the second largest art museum in the United States. Only the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has more space.\nHistory.\nIn 1866, a group of 35 artists founded the Chicago Academy of Design in a studio on Dearborn Street. The group wanted to run a free school with its own art gallery. The organization was modeled after European art academies, such as the Royal Academy. People who worked there were called Academians and Associate Academians. The Academy's charter was granted in March 1867.\nClasses started in 1868. Classes met every day. Students paid the school US$10 per month. The new Academy was a success. The school next built a five story stone building at 66 West Adams Street, which opened on November 22, 1870.\nWhen the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the building in 1871, the Academy began to owe a lot of money. The Academy tried and failed by renting facilities. By 1878, the Academy owed $10,000. Members tried to rescue the weak institution by making deals with local businesses. Some people gave up in 1879 and started a new new organization, named the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. When the Chicago Academy of Design went bankrupt the same year, the new Chicago Academy of Fine Arts bought its assets in an auction.\nIn 1882, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts changed its name to the current name, Art Institute of Chicago. The same year, it purchased a lot on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street for $45,000. The school rented the property's existing building, and a new building was constructed behind it to house the school's facilities.\nWhile Chicago planned how to host the 1892\u201393 World's Columbian Exposition (World's Fair), the Art Institute wanted a new building. The Art Institute proposed that the city build a permanent building on the lakefront for the fair and give the new building to the Institute afterwards. The city agreed, and the building was completed in time for the second year of the fair. Construction costs were paid by selling the Michigan/Van Buren property. On October 31, 1893, the Institute moved into the new building. This building is now called the Allerton Building. It faces Michigan Avenue on the west and the Illinois Central Railroad track on the east.\nFrom the 1900s to the 1960s, the school offered with the Logan Family (members of the board) the Logan Medal of the Arts. The Logan Medal became one of the most distinguished awards presented to artists in the US. In 1924, the museum building expanded to the east by bridging over the railroad tracks with a new wing on the east side of the tracks.\nBetween 1959 and 1970, some people did not think that photos (art and documentary photography) were serious art that should be shown in art galleries. The Institute fought to change people's minds to accept such photos. Photo curator Hugh Edwards lead this fight.\nAs Director of the museum starting in the early 1980s, James N. Wood conducted a major expansion of its collection and oversaw a major renovation and expansion project for its facilities. \"The New York Times\" called Wood \"one of the most respected museum leaders in the country\". Wood created major exhibitions of works by Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh that set records for attendance at the museum. He retired from the museum in 2004.\nIn 2006, the Art Institute began building its new \"The Modern Wing\". The new wing is on the southwest corner of Columbus and Monroe. Pritzker Prize winning architect Renzo Piano designed the new wing. It opened to the public on May 16, 2009. The building makes the Art Institute the second largest art museum in the United States. The building houses the museum\u2019s world-renowned collections of 20th- and 21st-century art, specifically modern European painting and sculpture, contemporary art, architecture and design, and photography.\nThe Museum\u2019s Collection.\nThe collection of the Art Institute of Chicago covers more than 5,000 years of human expression from cultures around the world. The museum owns more than 260,000 works of art. The art institute holds works of art ranging from as early as the Japanese prints to the most updated American art.\nToday, the museum is most famous for its collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and American paintings. There are more than 30 paintings by Claude Monet in the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection. These include six of Monet's \"Haystacks\" and a number of his \"Water Lilies\". Also in the collection are important works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir such as \"Two Sisters (On the Terrace)\" and Henri Matisse's \"The Bathers\", Paul C\u00e9zanne's \"The Basket of Apples\", and \"Madame C\u00e9zanne in a Yellow Chair.\" \"At the Moulin Rouge\" by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is another highlight, as are Georges Seurat's \"Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" and Gustave Caillebotte's \"Paris Street; Rainy Day\". Non-French paintings of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection include Vincent Van Gogh's \"Bedroom in Arles\" and \"Self-portrait, 1887\". The museum also has American art works including Grant Wood's \"American Gothic,\" Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" and Mary Cassatt's \"The Child's Bath.\" In September 2010, the Art Institute launched its first mobile application. This application is a catalogue (guide) to this Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection.\nThe Art Institute also shows a number of works that are not paintings. The Thorne Miniature Rooms hold 1:12 scale interiors showcasing American, European and Asian architectural and furniture styles from the Middle Ages to the 1930s (when the rooms were constructed).\nThe Touch Gallery of the museum is specially designed for people who cannot see. It has several works which museum guests are encouraged to experience though the sense of touch instead of through sight as well as specially designed description plates written in braille. The American Decorative Arts galleries contain furniture pieces designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and Charles and Ray Eames. The Ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman galleries hold the mummy and mummy case of Paankhenamun, as well as several gold and silver coins.\nThe Terra Collection.\nThe Terra Museum (now the Terra Foundation) was a separate Chicago art museum that closed in October 2004. Since April 2005, approximately fifty paintings from that museum have been on loan to the Department of American Art at the Art Institute of Chicago. The combined collections of the Terra and the Art Institute are located in a new suite of galleries. They provide one of the nation\u2019s most comprehensive presentations of American art. The foundation\u2019s collection of American works on paper are in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Art Institute.\nAfrican American Art Collection.\nArt Institute of Chicago promotes the study of art made by African-Americans. Its collection provide a historical illustration of the progress made by African Americans. Works also show African Americans' continuing struggle. The collection includes items dating from the Civil War era, from the Harlem Renaissance, from the civil rights struggles following World War II and from the contemporary period.\nEuropean Art Collection.\nThe Art Institute owns a collection of medieval art made in Europe during the years 800-1300 AD. It features both religious works and daily life objects. It includes painting and sculpture, luxury metalwork and stained glass, textiles and manuscript illumination. The museum owns major collections of arms and armor, jewelry, ceramics, and tapestries. The museum owns items from the Renaissance era (1300-1600) in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands.\nThe Art Institute Building.\nShepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston, Massachusetts designed the Allerton Building in the Beaux-Arts style. It was built for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition as the World's Congress Auxiliary Building with the intent that the Art Institute occupy the building after the fair closed.\nTwo bronze lion statues are on the sides of the Art Institute's western entrance on Michigan Avenue. Their sculptor Edward L. Kemeys gave them unofficial names: the south lion is \"stands in an attitude of defiance,\" and the north lion is \"on the prowl.\" When a Chicago sports team plays in the championships of their respective league (that is, the Super Bowl or Stanley Cup Finals, not the entire playoffs), the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. Evergreen wreaths are placed around their necks during the Christmas season.\nThe east entrance of the museum is marked by the stone arch entrance that was moved from the old Chicago Stock Exchange building. Louis Sullivan designed the Exchange in 1894. The Exchange was torn down in 1972. But saved portions of the original trading room were rebuilt inside the Art Institute.\nGalleries above the railroad tracks.\nThe Art Institute building is unusual because it is two sets of buildings linked by a two-story bridge over open-air railroad tracks. The construction of Millenium Park moved the Metra Electric and South Shore railroad lines underground. This made room for the new Modern Wing and exterior courtyards. Before this change, the lower level of the bridge building was formerly the windowless Gunsaulus hall, but is now home to the Alsdorf Galleries showcasing Indian, Southeast Asian and Himalayan Art. The renovation added windows facing north toward Millennium Park. Renzo Piano designed the gallery space in conjunction with his design of the Modern Wing. The gallery features the same window screening used there to protect the art from direct sunlight. The upper level of the bridge building formerly held the modern European galleries, But it was renovated in 2008. The galleries now show Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art.\nModern Wing.\nOn May 16, 2009, the Art Institute opened the Modern Wing, the largest expansion in the museum's history. The addition, designed by Renzo Piano, makes the Art Institute the second-largest museum in the US. The Modern Wing is home to the museum's collection of early 20th-century European art, including Pablo Picasso\u2019s \"The Old Guitarist\", Henri Matisse\u2019s \"Bathers by a River\", and Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s \"Time Transfixed.\" The Modern wing also houses contemporary art from after 1960; new photography, video media, architecture and design galleries. Those galleries show original renderings by Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Bruce Goff. The Modern wing also has temporary exhibition space; shops and classrooms; a cafe and a restaurant, \"Terzo Piano\", that overlooks Millennium Park from its terrace. In addition, the Nichols Bridgeway connects a sculpture garden on the roof of the Modern wing with the adjacent Millennium Park to the north and a courtyard designed by Gustafson Guthrie Nichol.\nIn 2009, the Modern Wing won a Chicago Innovation Awards.\nLibraries.\nThe Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries are on the ground floor of the museum. The Libraries' collections cover all periods of art, but is most known for its large collection of 18th-20th century architecture. The Libraries serve the museum staff, college, and university students, and the general public. The Friends of the Libraries is a support group for the Libraries. It offers events and special tours for its members.\nAdditional notable selections from the collection.\nNote that other notable works are in the collection but the following examples are ones in the public domain and for which pictures are available.

The others are Charon, discovered in 1978, Nix and Hydra, which were discovered in 2005, and Styx, discovered in 2012.\nDiscovery.\nThe moon was discovered by a Hubble Space Telescope observing team led by Mark Showalter, while they were trying to find out if Pluto had any rings. Kerberos was first seen in a photo taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, on June 28, 2011. More photos were taken on July 3 and July 18, 2011, to confirm that it exists. The moon was officially verified and announced on July 20, 2011. Kerberos was not seen in earlier Hubble photos because the exposure times were shorter. The moon may have appeared as a very faint smudge in photos taken in 2006, but was ignored because it was not clear. Kerberos is possibly also visible in images taken in 2010.\nStructure.\nKerberos has an estimated diameter of 13\u201334 km (8\u201321 miles).\nKerberos and Pluto's other moons are thought to have been created by a cosmic collision between the dwarf planet and another celestial body early in the Solar System's history."}

Being eaten is not the only threat to life: parasites and diseases may also be fatal. But animals, especially small animals, are often eaten. \nSince life is about reproduction, anything that keeps a creature alive long enough for it to reproduce will be selected for. The next generation comes from the fertilised eggs of the previous generation.\nNot surprisingly, then, animals have developed a wide range of defences against predation. Some of these defences apply also to plants: herbivory on plants can be very damaging, and reduce a plant's fertility. Many plants have some defence against herbivores.\nPrimary defences.\nPrimary defences make it less likely that there will be a meeting between the predator and the prey. In many cases this means the predator has not noticed or recognised the prey.\nDefinitions.\nThere are various definitions of what a primary defence is:\nMethods.\nFor palatable prey.\nIf the prey is good to eat, it must either make itself scarce, or it must look as though it is not good to eat. A third possibility is that the prey is too small to bother with. In other words, the effort of catching and eating it would not be worth the effort expended by the predator.\nFor prey with defences.\nDefences may be of two kinds. Either the prey is uneatable because it has some kind of chemical defence, or its body is protected by spines or stings. In that case the predator will reject it so long as the prey advertises its defence.\nThe second kind of defence is very obvious. It is to carry armour and/or offensive weapons like horns. These are permanent visible defences. For larger prey animals this can be effective if linked to another defence. Thus, in natural habitats, elephants have tusks, and they also have huge size. Antelope have horns, and can also run fast. Almost all large herbivores live in herds, which undoubtedly is safer than living alone.\nSecondary defences.\nThese work when a predator detects a prey, or when a prey notices a predator. The function of secondary defences is to increase the chance of the prey surviving the encounter (meeting).\nCosts of defence.\nEverything costs something. All defences incur costs. For survival, an animals needs food, and needs to stay alive to reproduce. Energy and time spent on defence can be considerable, but justified if it makes reproduction more likely. There are these kinds of costs:"}

Mothers and fathers of their chicks will feed their young by regurgitating the food into their mouth. Penguins get their food by diving into the ocean and chasing after their food. Penguins can survive up to 40 days without food. When penguins go hunting for their food, they swim from down in the water. Sometimes when they are hunting at night, they swim up to . But that is really rare. They usually swim for 2 minutes before coming up for air. Macaroni penguin chicks do not get any food until they are a week old.\nMacaroni penguins usually live on bumpy or flat ground. They don't really live in places with many plants, but some penguins make their nests around grass. Macaroni penguins generally live by the water because they eat seafood. \nMacaroni penguins have many different ways of communicating. They might make noisy, shrieking sounds or they might bobble their heads. Sometimes, they even flap their wings. They make their head feathers wave when they are excited.\nPenguins use their feet and tail to help them swim. They can swim up to 15 miles per hour. Swimming that fast helps them get away from predators that might eat them. Penguins spend a lot of their time swimming. Penguins are slow on land because they waddle their feet instead of walking. They sway their body from side to side while they waddle their feet. Sometimes, they also slide down hills on their belly which is much faster than waddling. Sliding helps them get to places faster."}

They are a species of penguin that lives near the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. The little penguin is the smallest of all penguins.\nDescription.\nThe penguins weigh around 0.9 kg (2 lbs) and are up to 40 cm (15 in) tall. On average, they are 33 cm (13 in) tall. \nThe little penguin is slate gray or indigo along the head and back, with a white belly and neck. The flippers - wings - are dark blue, with a white edge along the back. Males and females of the species are very similar but males have a curve on the end of their beak. Juvenile little penguins, which are younger than adults, have lighter colors. Little penguin chicks have blue-grey bellies and brown feathers.\nSubspecies.\nOriginally, the Eudyptula genus included two different species of penguin, the little penguin (\"E. minor\") and the fairy penguin (\"E. undina\"). In 1976, scientists combined these two species into one species (\"E. minor\") with six subspecies. However, new research on the penguins' mitochondrial DNA shows that the DNA of populations in the Australia and southern New Zealand region are very different from those of little penguins in northern New Zealand. Because of those discoveries, some researchers still argue about whether these two populations should be divided into two different species. Another common argument is over the classification of the white-flippered penguin. While most believe the white-flippered penguin is a subspecies of the little penguin, some argue that it is a different species. Others argue that it is not a subspecies at all, but a morph that just has different colors.\nThe six subspecies of the little penguin are:\nThe little penguin has different common names depending on their location. In Australia, they are often called fairy penguins because the Australia population was originally considered a part of that species. In New Zealand, they are called little blue penguins or blue penguins because their gray feathers look more blue in the sun. They are also called 'Koror\u0101' in M\u0101ori, the language of New Zealand natives.\nHabitat.\nLittle penguins live in sandy burrows at night and go to the ocean during the day. They can be found right around the south coast of Australia, from Perth in the west to Coffs Harbour on the east coast. They are found all around Tasmania. The largest little penguin colonies in New South Wales are on Montague Island, Tollgate Island and Brush Island.\nBehavior.\nCalls.\nThe little penguin is known for its wide variety of calls. In fact, one of the main ways scientists identify different little penguin subspecies is by the differences in the noises the penguin groups make.\nBecause little penguins live together in large groups, called colonies, it is important they can tell each other apart. Little penguins can find their mates, even in crowded and loud areas, by the distinctive call that each penguin makes.\nLittle penguins have one call that changes to mean different things. Most calls have a rhythm of two repeated sounds.\nReproduction.\nLittle penguins are the only penguin species that breeds nocturnally - that is, at night.\nIn popular culture.\nAt Phillip Island off the coast of Victoria, there is a \"Penguin Parade\" where lights and viewing stands have been set up so that people can watch the penguins return to their homes at dusk. Over 500,000 visitors from around the world visit each year."}

These temples were seen as houses for the gods. Sometimes they were specially for the pharaohs (kings). Within these temples the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals of the Egyptian religion. People would give offerings (gifts) to the gods. They would show the stories of the gods through festivals. These festivals would also help normal life to continue. The pharaohs were responsible for providing the temples and caring for the gods. This required a lot of labor and material for building and maintenance. It was necessary for the pharaohs to give this responsibility to priests. Most of the ordinary people did not take part in ceremonies and could not enter special parts of the temple. The temple was an important religious place for all classes of Egyptians. They went there to pray, give offerings, and seek guidance from the god dwelling within.\nThe most important part of the temple was the sanctuary. The sanctuary was the most secret and special place and usually had a statue of a god. In the early years of Egypt, about 3000 BCE, the temples were small. Priests and pharaohs added more rooms and the temples became bigger. The rooms would have a lot of decoration of the religion. By the time of the New Kingdom (c.1550-1070 BCE) the temples were huge buildings made of stone. The buildings were arranged in special ways for the religion. The temple would have halls, open areas, and very large entrance pillars. Some of these temples still exist today. Beyond the main temple was an outer wall. There would be other buildings inside the walls.\nA large temple also had a lot of land and employed thousands of ordinary people to supply its needs. Temples were also economic centers. The priests who managed the temples had a lot of influence. They would sometimes oppose the king.\nTemple-building continued in Egypt even when the nation declined and was ruled by the Roman Empire. Christianity brought more pressure on Egyptian religion. The last temple was closed in 550 CE. For hundreds of years, the ancient buildings were damaged and neglected. In the early 19th century, many people in Europe became interested in ancient Egypt. The study of ancient Egypt became known as the science of Egyptology. Egyptologists continue to study the surviving temples and the remains of destroyed ones. They tell us a lot about ancient Egyptian society.\nDozens of temples survive today. Some have become famous tourist attractions that bring money to modern Egypt."}

The city also has farm implement manufacturing, and is a supply center for area agriculture. Livestock-raising is a major activity while wheat and sorghum are the area's main crops. \nIn addition, a local tourism industry, including a casino resort, has developed to capitalize on Dodge City's history as an Old West cowtown.

The red admiral is also known to hibernate, re-emerging individuals showing prominently darker colourings than first brood subjects. The butterfly also flies on sunny winter days, especially in southern Europe.\nIn North America, the red admiral generally has two broods from March through October. Most of North America must be recolonized each spring by southern migrants, but this species over-winters in south Texas.\nOther red admiral species are:\nPainted ladies.\nThe painted ladies are a subgenus \"Cynthis\" of the red admirals.

They fly at high altitude on a 9,000-mile migration. It could take up to six successive generations for the species to complete a 9000 mile (14,400\u00a0km) round trip from tropical Africa to Europe.\nHuge numbers migrate.

The males give off a strong odour, hence its name. This musky odour is used to attract females during mating season. Musk oxen travel in herds of females and their young led by one or two strong males. Male oxen fight over who will be leader by butting their thick heads and horns against each other. The musk oxen's long, curved horns keep away predators. When a herd smells nearby wolves, all the musk oxen form a circle and face out. They lower their heads to show off their horns.\nMusk oxen live in Arctic North America and Greenland, with small introduced populations in Sweden, Siberia and Norway.\nMusk oxen are herbivores which graze on grasses, leaves, and some Arctic flowers. They are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. Later, they regurgitate the food (called a cud) and chew it. Musk oxen, like other ruminants, have a stomach with four sections.\nFossil DNA evidence suggests musk oxen were not only more geographically widespread during the Pleistocene, but also more genetically diverse. During that time, other populations of musk oxen lived across the Arctic, from the Ural Mountains to Greenland. Together with the bison and the pronghorn, the muskox was one of a few species of Pleistocene megafauna in North America to survive the Pleistocene/Holocene extinction event and live to the present day."}

Later it became known as Elf Aquitaine. Elf Aquitaine was listed on the NYSE in 1991. In 2000 Elf Aquitaine merged with Total Fina to form TotalFinaElf. In 2003, the name was changed to Total.\nFraud scandal.\nThe Elf scandal came to light in 1994 in France. According to \"The Guardian\", it was 'the biggest fraud inquiry in Europe since the Second World War... Elf became a private bank for executives who spent \u00a3200 million on political favors, mistresses, jewellery, fine art, villas and apartments'. Iraqi-born Nadhmi Auchi, received a 15-month suspended sentence and a \u00a31.5m fine for his involvement taking illegal commissions.\nMotorsport.\nFrom its beginnings, Elf used motor racing as a means of promotion. It had four-year deal with Matra starting in the French Formula 3 series. In 1969 the combination won the Formula One World Championship with Tyrrell and Jackie Stewart. By this time, Elf was owned by the French government. They began a new long-term relationship with Renault, which was also owned by the French government at the time. The Renault F1 racing cars carried Elf sponsorship until 2009. The Elf logos were replaced with Total logos."}

The group takes their name from the 1992 Danish movie \"Gayniggers from Outer Space\", and the words gay and nigger. They have trolled (made trouble for) many popular websites and Internet people. They have trolled many bloggers, and sites including Slashdot, Wikipedia, and CNN. They have also released software and made available secret information about operating systems. In addition, they maintain a wiki-based site that makes fun of Slashdot posts and have a software archive that has many GNAA coding projects.\nMembers of the GNAA also started Goatse Security, a grey hat computer safety group. Members of Goatse Security told media groups in June 2010 about a problem located on AT&amp;T's website that made the privacy of people who pre-ordered the iPad public. After the mistake in the website was talked about, the then-president of the GNAA, \"weev\", and GNAA member \"JacksonBrown\" were arrested by the police.\nBeginning and purpose.\nThe group says that it was started in 2002. There is not much information about the group's structure. Researcher Andrew Lih has said that it is not clear if there was a actual group of GNAA members at the start. Also not known is if the first members of the GNAA were online pranksters who used the name in order to disturb or disrupt websites.\nThe group's name has been causing trouble (known as trolling) on the Internet, having been described as causing \"alarm in anyone with [even a little bit] of good taste\", and as being \"[amazingly] offensive.\" However, the group claims that it is neither racist nor homophobic (fear of or hatred of gay people). GNAA members deny it when people say that they are racist. They say that these words are said only to get people to make angry responses and to undermine or challenge long-standing social norms, and say that the name of the group came from the 1992 Danish satirical blaxploitation movie (an exploitation movie made specifically for an urban, black people audience) \"Gayniggers from Outer Space\".\nTrolling.\nThe GNAA uses more than one way of causing damage to the Internet. One way is flooding (making many requests at once) weblogs with a very big amount of words and sentences, called \"crapflooding\". They have also made shocking websites that have malware that infects people who visit the sites. One website, \"Last Measure\", had malware that opened up pop-up windows that had shocking pictures. On Wikipedia, the group made a page about itself, while following every rule of Wikipedia in order to use the rules against themselves.\nThey have also attacked many Internet Relay Chat channels using IRC flooding. GNAA used an old but little known way to force users of the Freenode IRC network to flood IRC channels after going to websites that have malware. They also have used bugs in Firefox to crapflood IRC channels. They have also shown people new bugs and problems. These actions have sometimes stopped the day-to-day working of big websites such as Slashdot, even making some websites (like 4chan) to shut down for a little bit of time.\nIn July 2004, two GNAA members sent secret pictures of the future operating system Mac OS X v10.4 to the popular Apple Macintosh news website MacRumors, which read \"With WWDC just days away, the first Tiger information and [pictures] appears to have been leaked. [Sources say] Apple [might give our coders] ... a Mac OS X 10.4 preview copy at WWDC on Monday. The [pictures] were [said to have] come from this [future coder sneak-peek].\" Later, when people said that the images were fake, the GNAA made a press release which said that the screenshots were real and said that they had \"trolled\" the Apple websites.\nIn June 2005, the GNAA said that they had made a Mac OS X Tiger release for Intel x86 processors which made media stories from many sources. The next day, the suspicious leak and was talked about on the G4 show \"Attack of the Show\". The DVD put on BitTorrent just showed an image of Goatse when you started your computer and not the OS X Tiger as many people were led to believe.\nOn February 3, 2007, the GNAA tricked CNN reporter Paula Zahn into thinking that \"one in three Americans\" think that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks were done by Israeli agents. CNN then decided to publish a story, not truthfully reporting this, adding pictures of the GNAA-owned website jewsdidwtc.com The story had a round-table talk about people who hate Jews and a talk with the father of a Jewish 9/11 victim. The GNAA-owned website had claims that \"over 4,000\" Jews were not at work at the World Trade Center on 9/11.\nGoatse Security.\nMany members of the GNAA with experience in grey hat computer safety research began giving out details about security problems under the name \"Goatse Security.\" Goatse Security takes its name from a shock site called goatse. They chose a new name to publish their work under because they were afraid that their work would not get talked about if given out by the \"Gay Nigger Association of America.\"\nIn June 2010, Goatse Security got attention from the media for their finding of 114,000 email addresses owned by people who pre-ordered Apple's 3G iPad. The data was retrieved from AT&amp;T's own servers. The FBI soon investigated the event. This search for the truth led to the arrest of then-GNAA President, Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer, on drug charges that happened because of an FBI search of his house, and were not having anything to do with his hacking."}

The farthest point reached by the attack has been called the high-water mark of the Confederacy.\nThe charge is named after Maj. Gen. George Pickett. Pickett was one of three Confederate generals who led the attack under Longstreet.\nLee hoped to attack the Union center on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Confederate attacks on both Union sides had failed the day and night before. On the night of July 2, General Meade said at a council of war that he thought Lee would try an attack on his lines in the center the next day.\nA large attack by artillery took place before the infantry charge. The Confederates hoped the artillery attack would make the Union weaker. It did not work well. About 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades marched over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Some Confederates were able to get past the low stone wall that many of the Union defenders hid behind. However, they could not hold this area. The Union pushed the Confederates back. Over 50% of the Confederate soldiers on the charge suffered casualties. This defeat ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania. Years later, when asked why his charge at Gettysburg failed, General Pickett said: \"I've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it.\""}

It began as dance music in the red-light districts of American cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans years before being published as popular sheet music for piano.\nRagtime was a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms typical of African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin became famous through the publication in 1899 of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" and a string of ragtime hits that followed. For at least 12 years after its publication, the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.\nRagtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public's imagination after 1917, but there have been numerous revivals since. First, in the early 1940s many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records. A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded.\nIn 1971 Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Scott Joplin's work which was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 1973, the motion picture \"The Sting\" brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes. Subsequently, the film's rendering of Joplin's 1902 rag \"The Entertainer\" was a Top 5 hit in 1974.\nRagtime (with Joplin's work in the forefront) has been cited as an American equivalent of minuets by Mozart, mazurkas by Chopin, or waltzes by Brahms. Ragtime influenced classical composers including Erik Satie, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky. Ragtime was included in the dance styles of Vernon and Irene Castle, and influenced the English ballroom dances, the foxtrot and the quickstep."}

The army was also known as Mr. Lincoln's Army due to the close involvement by President Abraham Lincoln. It had two missions. The first was to protect Washington, D.C.. The second mission was to defeat the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. The generals who led the Army of the Potomac remain some of the most controversial military leaders in history. Under Irvin McDowell, George McClellan, Joseph Hooker and George G. Meade, the army had more defeats than victories.\nHistory.\nThe Army of the Potomac had its beginnings when President Lincoln called for 75,000 militia from Northern states. This was just a day after the garrison at Fort Sumter surrendered to Confederate forces. These units were to serve for 90 days and each state governor was given a quota. At the time 90 days was the maximum time militia units could serve under the Militia Act of 1795. In 1861, the regular U.S. Army only had 16,367 officers and men. They were organized into 197 companies, 179 of which were scattered in frontier duty in the west. East of the Mississippi River the remaining 18 companies were all artillery. In total there were only six generals including the General-in-Chief, Winfield Scott.\nThere was an urgency to gathering an army together as quickly as possible. Washington was being threatened by the presence of 20,000 Confederate troops camped just 25 miles away near Manassas, Virginia. During the months of April, May and June of 1861, volunteers were everywhere. Almost daily a new group arrived by train. They camped everywhere, even on the White House lawn. On May 24, 1861, Brigadier general Irwin McDowell took command of the new army, called the Army of Northeastern Virginia. With training still incomplete McDowell was ordered to engage the Confederate forces at Manassas. He moved south very slowly which allowed the Confederate commander, P. G. T. Beauregard, enough time to call for reinforcements from his fellow general, Joseph E. Johnston. The engagement that followed was called the First Battle of Bull Run.\nFirst Battle of Bull Run.\nAlso called the First Battle of Manassas, fought on July 21, 1861 it was the first large battle of the American Civil War. McDowell started marching part of his army around the left end of the Confederate army attempting a flanking maneuver. The two armies started shooting at each other about 6 a.m. near Matthews Hill. The Confederates did not expect the Union army to attack but they moved brigades to their left flank. The Union army pushed the Confederates back from Matthews Hill about 11 a.m. The Confederates retreated back to another hill called Henry House Hill. On the hill was Thomas J. Jackson's brigade. Another Confederate general was trying to regroup his men. When Jackson rushed forward to fill a gap in the Confederate line the general said, \"Look men, there is Jackson standing like a stone wall!\" After the battle Jackson would be called \"Stonewall Jackson\". All the Union attacks on the Confederate lines failed. In the afternoon the Confederates made an attack of their own. This drove the Union army back towards Washington, D.C. The Confederates were too tired to chase after them.\nFour days later, McDowell was replaced by Major general George B. McClellan. A month later the name was changed to the Army of the Potomac. McClellan began training McDowell's raw troops. He organized the army and made sure they were well equipped. For several months, Lincoln urged MaClellan to take the Army of the Potomac and go on the offensive. Finally Lincoln demanded he take action against the Confederate army.\nPeninsula Campaign.\nIn March 1862, the Army of the Potomac began its first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. McClellan landed his army at Fort Monroe. The Army then moved northwest, up the Virginia Peninsula. The Confederate defensive position on the Warwick Line caught McClellan by surprise. McClellan ordered his army to prepare for a siege of Yorktown, Virginia. Before the Union army was ready, the Confederates began a withdrawal toward Richmond. The first heavy fighting of the campaign happened in the Battle of Williamsburg. The Union troops managed some small victories, but the Confederates continued their withdrawal. An amphibious flanking movement cut off the Confederate retreat. In the Battle of Drewry's Bluff, an attempt by the U.S. Navy to reach Richmond by way of the James River failed."}
{"id": "303667", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303667", "title": "Army of Northern Virginia", "text": "The Army of Northern Virginia was the most successful of any Confederate army during the American Civil War. It was the main Confederate fighting force in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. The army often fought against the Union Army of the Potomac. The army was led by several generals during its early history, but was best known for its final leader, General Robert E. Lee, who took over in June of 1862. For that reason it was often called \"Lee's army\".\nHistory.\nThe army, when first organized was called the (Confederate) Army of the Potomac. It was formed October 22, 1861. Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard was first given command of what was called the \"Alexandria Line\" on May 31, 1861. He joined his troops near Manassas, Virginia on June 2. He planned an attack on Washington, D.C. which first required pushing the Union army back behind Bull Run. He called for additional support from Joseph E. Johnston's army in the Shenandoah Valley. On the morning of July 21, 1861, Beauregard planned a surprise attack on the Union forces that failed. He was driven back until the afternoon, when Johnston's troops arrived by train. The Confederates were then able to push the Union forces back and created a victory out of a near-disaster. Both Beauregard and Johnston were full generals. But Johnson took over command of the two armies which were now merged into one. Confederate President Jefferson Davis did not like or agree with Beauregard. There was a series of verbal disputes with Beauregard following Johnston taking command. Possibly as a result, Beauregard was sent west in January 1862 to serve as second in command in the Army of Mississippi.\nIn the Battle of Seven Pines, Johnston was wounded. Jefferson Davis appointed Lee to take over command. In June 1862, when Lee took over, the army was a collection of various commands in Virginia and North Carolina. This is also when the army reached its peak strength of 90,000 soldiers. When he replaced Johnston, his orders had the heading \"Department of Northern Virginia,\" and the \"Army of Northern Virginia\". From that time on that was the name it was known by.\nThe army under Lee.\nLee wanted to inspire his troops telling them \"every man has resolved to maintain the ancient fame of the Army of Northern Virginia and the reputation of its general and to conquer or die in the approaching contest.\" There was no ancient history, it was a newly formed army. But Lee got the idea across. The first first series of battles under Lee, called Seven Days Battles, defined Lee's army. His soldiers were tough, dedicated men willing to inflict and suffer great casualties in order to win battles. Between 1861 and 1865, the Army of Northern Virginia fought in dozens of battles. Some of the better known are the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg. In the Battle of Fredericksburg his army managed to inflict 12,653 casualties on the Union army while losing only 5,377 men. In December 1861, Lee corrected one of his officers after a fight saying \"you allow these people to get away\". \"Go after them, and damage them all you can!\" In the months following Lee's takeover of the Army of Northern Virginia, as they drove the Union army away from Richmond, Virginia, and out of Virginia, he became a hero to his soldiers and the people of Virginia.\nAntietam and the Maryland Campaign.\nAntietam was the third of four battles in Lee's Maryland Campaign. It fought on September 17, 1862 and was the bloodiest one-day battle of the Civil War. Exact numbers are unknown, but official records show the Army of Northern Virginia suffered 10,320 casualties (killed, wounded or missing). The Union Army of the Potomac suffered 12,400 casualties.\nLee's goal was for the Army of Northern Virginia to invade the Northern states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. That way he could threaten the cities of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. By a series of decisive victories Lee thought that the South could gain recognition from England and France and get them to support the Southern cause. The hope was if Lee's army was victorious, it might cause Abraham Lincoln to sue for peace. During the month of September Lee had moved his army north. They captured the garrison at the Battle of Harpers Ferry. Lee's army was driven back at the Battle of South Mountain and withdrew again after a day of heavy fighting at Antietam. Retreating back into Virginia, Lee managed to reinforce General George B. McClellan's overly-cautious nature with a successful rearguard action at the Battle of Shepherdstown. It stopped the Union Army of the Potomac from chasing the Army of Northern Virginia back into Virginia. From a military standpoint, Antietam was a draw. But it gave Lincoln the opportunity he needed to claim a victory and use it to deliver his Emancipation Proclamation.\nChancellorsville.\nAt Chancellorsville, Lee's army defeated the Army of the Potomac once again, this time inflicting 16,800 casualties while losing 13,000 men. The victory at Chancellorsville brought new hope to the South. It reinforced the idea that a single blow to the North could win the war. His soldiers and officers held Lee in the highest regard. They trusted his judgment and believed him to be a military genius. At this same time the Union Army of the Potomac was suffering poor morale under General Joseph Hooker. Time and again the Army of Northern Virginia, which had fewer men and far fewer resources, defeated the larger Army of the Potomac. Lee carefully monitored events in the Northern newspapers for any and all information about his enemy.\nGettysburg.\nGettysburg was Lee's next chance to strike a final blow that would win the war. The battle was fought from July 1 to July 3, 1863. This time Lee suffered more casualties than he could afford. The standoff that was Gettysburg ended Lee's invasion of the north and nearly destroyed the Army of Northern Virginia. Now the war was turned around for the Union. \nThe battle revealed the Army of Northern Virginia had another agenda. As the Confederate army swept northward into Pennsylvania, the soldiers rounded up escaped slaves and free blacks. African-Americans, men, women and children were gathered up and taken with the army as they marched north. When the Army of Northern Virginia retreated, they took the captured black people, estimated to be over a thousand, back to Virginia. There those who had escaped slavery were returned to their slaveowners. Others were sold at auction or imprisoned. Lee may not have ordered the \"slave hunt\". Once in Pennsylvania he told his troops \"no greater disgrace could befall the army,\" or discredit the Confederate cause, \"than the perpetuation of the barbarous outrages upon the unarmed and defenceless [sic] and the wanton destruction of private property that have marked the course of the enemy in our own country.\" This did not stop his officers and men from rounding up blacks. In one case at Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, soldiers threatened to burn \"every house which harbored a fugitive slave\". They gave the people in their homes 20 minutes to give up any black people.\nAppomattox.\nIn mid-May, 1864, rumors were going around that the Army of Northern Virginia was beaten. A Union officer on General George G. Meade's staff corrected the idea. He said \"Lee is a brave and skillful soldier and he will fight while he has a division or a day's rations left.\" Of Lee's soldiers Lyman said \"These rebels are not half-starved and ready to give up\u2014a more sinewy, tawny, formidable-looking set of men could not be\". Lyman knew they were still a deadly fighting force even after three years of hard war against a larger and better equipped army. Not surprisingly, it would take another 11 months of hard fighting before the Army of Northern Virginia finally surrendered at Appomattox."}

In November 1951, the first floodlit game between two Scottish senior teams occurred at Ochilview Park, between Stenhousemuir and Hibernian.\nIn the summer of 1964, Rangers FC revealed a plan to The Scottish Football League to remove the Warriors from the league, along with four other clubs, on the basis that they were poorest-supported clubs over the previous three seasons. Four years later, Stenhousemuir, along with Albion Rovers, Berwick Rangers, Brechin City and Stranraer, with support from a number of clubs, including Celtic F.C., Hamilton Academical F.C. and Airdrieonians F.C., successfully defeated this plan.\nIn 1972\u201373, the Warriors defeated Rangers 2\u20131 at Ibrox Stadium in the Scottish League Cup. Notably, Rangers were the holders of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup at the time.\n1990\u2013present.\nIn 1992\u201393, the team allowed their rivals Stirling Albion to share their stadium Ochilview Park. In the 1993\u201394 season, the Warriors moved out of the bottom league for the first time, due to the formation of the Scottish Third Division. The mid-90s was one of the club's most successful periods in its history; in 1994\u201395 they defeated St. Johnstone 4\u20130 and Aberdeen 2\u20130, both higher league opposition, en-route to the Scottish Cup quarter finals. In the 1995\u201396 season, Stenhousemuir won the Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Dundee United 5\u20134 on penalties after a goalless 90 minutes and extra time. In the process, reaching their first national semi-final since 1902.\nStenhousemuir was relegated from the Scottish Second Division to the Scottish Third Division for the first time in the history of the club. However, the next season winning promotion back to the Second Division, also a first in its history.\nIn 2006\u201307, the club announced a plan to lay 'fake' grass at Ochilview Park. It became the first in the UK to pass the FIFA 2 Star category accreditation.\nStenhousemuir were promoted to the Scottish Second Division after defeating Cowdenbeath 5\u20134 on penalties after drawing 0\u20130 on aggregate in the play-off final at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. The 2010\u201311 season saw the club narrowly avoid relegation after spending most of the season in the relegation zone. On the final day of the season the club defeated Peterhead 3\u20130 to move above Alloa Athletic and therefore avoided the relegation play-offs.\nFor the 2011/2012 Season, the Home Kit is sponsored by Figure 11 Communications Ltd, the Away Kit is sponsored by Apex Hotels, and the rear of kit sponsor is Wright &amp; MacLennan.\nSupporters.\nStenhousemuir Supporters' Club is the official supporters' club of Stenhousemuir FC. It is a democratic organisation based on one vote per person, and its committee is elected every year by the members. It is the largest shareholder in the club with about 11 % of the shares with the aim to increase the shareholding so that no individual(s) can take control of the club away from its supporters.\nThe Kriss Akabusi Loyal is a band of traveling supporters. It has a democratically-elected representative on the Stenhousemuir FC Board to relay supporter's ideas and wishes. This person serves two years on the Board before being replaced by another member of the committee.\nThe club also has many foreign supporters: the Norwegian Supporters' Club is a small supporters' organisation based in Oslo, Norway). The Supporters Club was founded on New Year's Eve 1992 by Rolf Erik Wulff, Christian Wulff and Kjell Jarslett. In 1996 it was given one share of Stenhousemuir F.C. as a recognition of their support and promotion of the club. As of today, the supporters club and its members owns about 5% of the shares in Stenhousemuir. Also the Stenhousemuir FC Danish Support. The Denmark based supporters club is an unofficial Warriors fan club founded and established in the summer 2000. The fan club has approximately 30 members.\nStenhousemuir Supporters Trust also The 'Warriors Supports Trust' is registered with the Financial Services Agency as a not-for-profit Industrial and Provident Society. It was established in 2003. It works with the Board of the football club and the Supporters Club to develop a more successful football club. The annual membership subscription of the Trust is \u00a35 but Trust members can take out either a 'silver' membership of \u00a35 a month, or a 'gold' membership of \u00a310 a month. The cash obtained from membership of the Trust is used to buy shares the football club has for sale, and hence the club benefits financially. Since its inception the Trust has given money to the club and its members have given their time and labour towards several projects. The current Chairman of the Stenousemuir Supporters Trust is Graeme Wallace who is also the stadium announcer at Ochilview\nCurrent squad.\n\"As of 20 June 2011\""}

Its mass is equivalent to the mass of tens of thousands of Milky Ways.\nAll the galaxies in the GA are redshifted, in accordance with the expansion of the Universe. They are receding relative to us and to each other, but the variations in their redshift show the existence of the Attractor. The variations in their redshifts range from about +700\u00a0km/s to -700\u00a0km/s, depending on where they are in relation to the Great Attractor.\nPosition.\nThe position of the Great Attractor was finally worked out in 1986. It is between 150 and 250 million light years (47\u201379 million parsecs) away. Objects in that direction lie in the Zone of Avoidance, which is the part of the night sky obscured by the Milky Way galaxy. Because of this, they are difficult to study with visible light. However, X-ray observations have revealed that the region of space is dominated by the Norma Cluster, a massive cluster of galaxies, with large, old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, and/or radiating large amounts of radio waves.\nIn 2005, astronomers conducted an X-ray survey of part of the sky known as the Clusters in the Zone of Avoidance. The survey confirmed earlier theories that the Milky Way galaxy was in fact being pulled towards a much more massive cluster of galaxies near the Shapley Supercluster, which is beyond the Great Attractor."}

However, the effects of the Zone drops at longer wavelengths, such as the infrared, and the Milky Way is effectively transparent at radio wavelengths. Surveys in the infrared have given us a more complete picture of the extragalactic sky. Indeed, two very large nearby galaxies, Maffei 1 and Maffei 2, were discovered in the Zone of Avoidance by Paolo Maffei by their infrared emission in 1968. Even so, about 10% of the sky remains difficult to survey because extragalactic objects (for example, distant galaxies) can be confused with stars in the Milky Way.\nProjects to survey the Zone of Avoidance at radio wavelengths have detected many galaxies that could not be detected in the infrared.

Poisson worked on the mathematical bases of wave theory, acoustics, elasticity, electricity and heat. He was also interested in the electric properties of solids. In 1812, he published his extension of Laplace's equation, which allowed its use for electric charge at the surface of solids. In the year 1818, he predicted the existence of a phenomenon called the Poisson spot, in the case that light should have the character of a wave. Poisson thought that was not the case and that it had the character of particles. He had long discussions with Augustin-Jean Fresnel, who thought that light was indeed a wave. This discussion only ended when Fresnel could show the existence of the spot Poisson had predicted in an experiment. In 1838, Poisson published his ideas on probability theory, which also included what is now known as Poisson distribution. This distribution was already known to Abraham de Moivre. \nThe relation between pressure and volume in the adiabatic process is constant, this is known as \"Poisson's Law\" today.

Most of the time only children who are younger than five years old get the disease. The signs of the disease are severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which start suddenly and last for two or three days. Rotavirus also causes diarrhoea in animals. A vaccine, which prevents children from getting the disease is available in many countries.\nLike most viruses, rotaviruses are made from RNA and protein. The RNA carries the genes that are used to make more rotaviruses. They are called rotaviruses because they sometimes look like little wheels and \"rota\" is the latin word for \"wheel\". Rotaviruses get into the body through the mouth and are not present in the air like the viruses that cause colds. The disease is most often spread by dirty hands and things used for cooking, but the viruses can contaminate water. Rotaviruses are very small. They are a lot smaller than bacteria and can only be seen using an electron microscope. \nChildren who have not been vaccinated usually get infected more than once. But when children are about five years old they are usually immune and cannot get it any more. This is because their bodies have become resistant to the viruses.\nRotaviruses infect the cells that the small intestine is made from. This makes it difficult for the body to digest food. Children usually make a complete recovery from the infection. But it is very important to make sure they drink enough water to replace what they are losing. In many countries the medicine used is called \"oral rehydration solution\". This comes in a small packet that is added to drinking water. It contains salt and sugar, which helps the body take up the water.\nRotaviruses were discovered in the 1970s. Since then doctors and scientists have shown that they are a problem to children all over the world. More than 500,000 children die from rotavirus infection each year and almost two million more become severely ill. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation are helping to pay for rotavirus vaccines in countries that cannot afford to buy them. Between 2006 and 2011 he gave more than 82 million US dollars."}

The goal of this organization was to destroy Yugoslavia and to establish an independent Croatia, following the vision of Usta\u0161e leader Ante Paveli\u0107 and ideology of Mile Budak. It was founded in 1955 by escaped Usta\u0161e war criminal Vjekoslav Luburi\u0107, a chief guard of the Jasenovac concentration camp.\nWhile Luburi\u0107 was the head of this organization, Odpor maintained regular contacts with associations of Nazi war veterans in Germany and Spain. Very close relations were established with fascist Spanish \"Blue Guard\" veterans. Odpor had stated that:\n\"[We] regard Yugoslavism and Yugoslavia as the greatest and only evil that has caused the existing calamity [...] We therefore consider every direct or indirect help to Yugoslavia as treason against the Croatian nation [...] Yugoslavia must be destroyed - be it with the help of the Russians or the Americans, of Communists, non-Communists or anti-Communists - with the help of anyone willing the destruction of Yugoslavia: destroyed by the dialectic of the word, or by dynamite - but at all costs destroyed.\"\nOdpor had its Australian branch based in Melbourne. It was linked to the Odpor headquarters in Spain and to other arms of the Ustashe movement around the world. The Australian branch was led by Ustashe Srecko Blaz Rover\nOdpor was heavily involved in racketeering, attempted murder, extortion, hijacking, terrorist bombing, and other violent crimes. After Luburi\u0107's death, his successors on the organization commanding post, sought out criminal organization ties with La Cosa Nostra, the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and the Croatian Mafia in San Pedro.\nOdpor most spectacular action was the 10 September 1976 hijacking of Trans World Airlines flight, en route from New York to Chicago. Odpor's five hijackers diverted the plane to Newfoundland, from there to Iceland, and ultimately to Paris with passengers aboard. The terrorists had planted a bomb in Grand Central Station. After authorities met the terrorists' demands, the bomb location was revealed. The bomb deactivation killed one policeman and another three wounded, when they tried to deactivate it. After terrorists learned that the bomb in New York had exploded and killed a policeman, they surrendered to French police.\nThe leaders of the hijackers of TWA Flight 355, Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 and his wife, Julienne Bu\u0161i\u0107, were both convicted on U.S. federal charges of air piracy and murder in May 1977 and sentenced to life imprisonment.\nJulienne Bu\u0161i\u0107 was released from prison on lifelong parole in 1989. Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107 briefly escaped from prison on 16 March 1987 but was quickly captured two days later. Julienne Bu\u0161i\u0107 was appointed by President Franjo Tudjman to the diplomatic post of adviser to the Croatian ambassador to the United States. This appointment of a convicted terrorist to a diplomatic post within the United States drew protests in December 1994 from the New York Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association as well as from Kathlyn Murray, the widow of the police officer killed by the bomb in Grand Central Station in 1976.\nHer husband, Zvonko Bu\u0161i\u0107, was paroled in July 2008 and expelled from the U.S. to Croatia.\nIn 1980es Odpor carried out five bombings in the United States. Bombed were (causing no injuries):\nOdpor was banned in Germany for terrorist activities and operated between legitimate emigre functions and a thuggish underworld. Its leaders tried to distance the organization from the acts of the so-called renegade elements that hijacked international flights and served prison sentences for extortion. It embraced a radical nationalist ideology that differed only marginally from Usta\u0161e ideology.\nA number of terrorist attacks against Yugoslavia were organized by this Usta\u0161e organization. They were Miro Bare\u0161i\u0107's killing of ambassador Vladimir Rolovi\u0107, bomb attacks in Belgrade cinemas, terrorist group actions in Krajina region during the Croatian Spring of 1971, and the JAT Flight 367 bombing of 1972.\nThe organization published its own magazine, \"Drina\". Odpor was dissolved in 1991."}

They are also known as safe haven (safe zone) games, because players generally score points and take risks by running between various safe zones in the field. These teams take turns \"batting\" and \"fielding.\" The team that is batting can score. The team that is fielding is defending. Both teams have equal chances batting and fielding. Bat-and-ball games are not timed, but are counted (such as by number of \"innings\" or \"rounds\".)\nThe name bat-and-ball games comes from some common parts of most of these games. In most games, a player on the fielding team puts a ball into play, mostly by throwing the ball. (How the player does this depends on the game's rules.) Then a player on the batting team tries to hit the ball, usually with a \"bat.\" A bat is a kind of club, though the size and shape depend on the rules. This player can then run between the safe zones in the field to score points, though the fielding team can use the ball on the player from the batting team, or a target in one of the safe zones, to get the player \"out\" if they are not in a safe zone. (In cricket, a player who is out can not score points for the rest of their team's scoring turn, while in other bat-and-ball sports, they might have to wait before batting again.) Thus, the further the batting player can hit the ball away from the defensive players, the more points they are likely to be able to score. \nThe two most popular bat-and-ball games in the world are cricket and baseball. Games like golf and hockey, which also use clubs, are \"not\" bat-and-ball games. (In golf, there are no teams. In hockey, the teams do not take turns \"batting\" and \"fielding.\")\nCommon parts.\nHere are some things many bat-and-ball games have:\nItems used in game.\nIn the field, there may be:"}

Scientists classify viruses to make it easier to learn about them. Classification also helps scientists to remember viruses and the diseases they cause. The International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is in charge of virus classification. \nSometimes different viruses have things in common. This is used in classification. For example, if they are made from DNA and protein, or RNA and protein. Other things that are taken into account are the size and shape of the viruses and the diseases they cause.\nSimilar viruses are first put into \"families\". Each family has a name. This family name always ends with \"\"-viridae\". For example, rotaviruses are in the \"Reoviridae\" family and herpes viruses are in the \"Herpesviridae\" family.\nViruses in any one family that are almost the same are then put in a smaller group called a \"genus\".\nAnother way of classifying viruses is called the Baltimore Classification. This is different from the ICTV one. Some scientists prefer the Baltimore Classification because it is based on how viruses grow in cells. "}

Instead, there were many kingdoms and duchies (places ruled by dukes) in the Italian Peninsula. In 1861, they all became one country and King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia became the King of Italy. In WW1, Italy was on the allies side and was one of the winners. In 1922, Benito Mussolini became Prime Minister. He was a fascist leader and made Italy into a dictatorship without much liberty. \nWhen WW2 began, Mussolini led Italy to be allied with Hitler, and the Axis powers. The axis powers lost WW2. Mussolini's leadership ended in 1943, and he was killed in 1945. Germany invaded Italy and this is why Italy didn't become an occupied country as Germany did. In 1946, the people voted to get rid of the monarchy and become today's Italian Republic and slowly became stable again.\nColonies.\nItaly began their colonial empire in the late 1880s when they conquered Eritrea and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. In the 1910's, they took Libya from the Ottoman Empire. In 1936, Italy conquered Ethiopia, creating the colony of Italian East Africa. When they lost WW2, their colonies were lost to the British and the French. \nAftermath of World War II.\nNazi Germany controlled Italy at the end of WW2 , but they eventually were invaded by the Allies and when Hitler killed himself, The Nazis lost WW2. After Nazi Germany ceased to exist, Italy was independent again. However, all was not good. Italy was left in huge debt, causing Italy to be poor. Many people from Italy emigrated to the United States to escape being poor. In 1946, People voted to get rid of the monarchy (kings) and establish the new Italian Republic. Slowly, the new government helped Italy get back up again into its current state. Also, dramatically, people stopped emigrating because life in Italy was becoming better. "}

She was the founder of British family planning, and fought many battles in print with those whose opinions differed from hers.\nEducation.\nStopes was one of the most highly educated women of her time. Her parents, who were both well educated, kept her away from school until she was twelve. She went to University College London in 1900, and graduated in 1902 with double honours in Botany and Geology. She was awarded a year's scholarship for research.\nStopes next went to the University of Munich, where she got a PhD in palaeobotany (fossil plants). She took the \"viva voce\" in German. In 1905 she became DSc (Doctor of Science) of the University of London. She was then the youngest holder of the Doctor of Science degree in England.\nCareer.\nBotany.\nStopes published about 100 papers and books on botany, mostly on fossil plants. She was expert on fossil ferns, cycads and gymnosperms.\nShe held a lecturership in palaeobotany at the University of Manchester from 1904 to 1907; she was first female academic of that university.p12 In 1910, at the age of 30, she became a Fellow of University College London. She had reached the top of the tree. Not only was she a palaeobotanist, but she was an expert on the botany of the coal measures which were laid down in the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous). Coal was the most vital source of energy at that time.\nStopes continued to publish on botany until 1935, but by about 1912 her interests began to change because of problems in her private life.\nBirth control and female health.\nAfter a disastrous marriage, Stopes became aware of how ignorant many people were about sex, and what troubles women had inside marriage. Her goals were: improved happiness through better knowledge, and the protection of female health by controlling the pregnancies which naturally occurred in marriage.\nStopes' first book on family planning, \"Married Love: a new contribution to the solution of the sex difficulties\", 1918, ran to 28 editions and over 150 reprints. It was translated into 14 languages, and braille. The English-language version sold over a million copies, and made her rich.\nThe social effects of the book were tremendous. No-one can say why social changes take place, yet attitudes to sex and marriage certainly changed during her life. Between the first edition of her book and the last, the women of the Europe and North America changed from almost no birth control to most using birth control. This was despite the opposition of the Catholic Church and other forces.\nAlso, there has been a continuous improvement in knowledge about sex and in medical attention to female needs in relation to birth. The availability of knowledge on all subjects relating to personal life has continued to improve.\nLater in 1918 Stopes published a second book, \"Wise Parenthood: a sequel\". This ran to 25 editions and many reprints. in 1919 came \"A letter to working mothers on how to have healthy children and avoid weakening pregnancies\". The stream of books and pamphlets continued to the end of her life.\nThe Marie Stopes Clinic.\nStopes opened the UK's first family planning clinic at 61, Marlborough Road, Holloway, North London on 17 March 1921. In 1925 the Mothers' Clinic moved to Central London, where it remains to this day.\nThe parent body of Marie Stopes Clinics round the world is now called Marie Stopes International. It is especially strong in Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nPersonal life.\nStopes had a relationship with Japanese botanist Kenjiro Fujii (or Fugii). They met at the University of Munich in 1904 whilst she researched her Ph.D. It was serious, and in 1907 she went to be with him in Japan. However, the affair ended there.\nIn 1911 Stopes married Canadian botanist and geneticist Reginald Ruggles Gates. It was a disaster which changed her life. She got a divorce on the grounds that the marriage was never consummated. Her marriage to Gates was annulled in 1914.\nIn 1918 she married Humphrey Verdon Roe. He was the financial backer of her most famous work, \"Married Love\".\nStopes died at her home in Dorking, Surrey, UK from breast cancer."}

At one time she was on the top of the Gestapo's most wanted list. A novel by Sebastian Faulks based on her life called \"Charlotte Gray\", was later made into a movie starring Cate Blanchett.\nWake was born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1911, and moved to Australia when she was two. She ran away from home at the age of 16, and in 1935 went to London. She learned to be a journalist and worked in Paris. She married a rich factory owner, Henry Fioca in 1939. When the war started she became an ambulance driver. She soon became a part of a group led by Pat O'Leary (real name Albert Gu\u00e9risse) which helped British soldiers escape from France. The Gestapo soon noticed her activities and she fled to Spain. Her husband was captured, tortured and shot dead.\nIn England she joined the Special Operation Executive (SOE). In April 1944, Wake was parachuted into France to work with the French Resistance before the D-Day landings. She was involved in several major battles with the German army. She claimed to have once killed an SS soldier with her bare hands.\nShe was given several important medals for bravery including the British George Medal, the French Croix de Guerre (on three occasions), the M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance and she was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. The Americans gave her the Medal of Freedom. In 2004 Australia made her a Companion of the Order of Australia.\nShe was an unusual woman for her time. She had a reputation among the soldiers she worked with for being a heavy drinker. Major John Farmer said about her drinking that \"...we just couldn't work out where it all went\". When the Australian government offered her a medal she said they could \"stick their medals where the monkey sticks his nuts\". She sold her medals to support her income in her old age. She said \"There was no point in keeping them, I'll probably go to hell and they'd melt anyway\"."}

It is very old, and moving relatively fast.\nIn 1916, the American astronomer E. E. Barnard measured its proper motion as 10.3 arcseconds per year. This is the largest-known proper motion of any star relative to the Sun. At a distance of about 1.8 parsecs from the Solar System, or just under six light-years, Barnard's Star is the nearest known star in the constellation Ophiuchus, and the fourth-closest known individual star to the Sun, after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system. Despite its proximity, Barnard's Star, at a dim apparent magnitude of about nine, is not visible with the unaided eye; however, it is much brighter in infrared light than it is in visible light.\nDetails.\nBarnard's Star has been the subject of much study, and it has probably received more attention from astronomers than any other class M dwarf star due to its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator. Barnard's Star is also notable as the target for Project Daedalus, a study on the possibility of fast, unmanned travel to nearby star systems.\nAt seven to 12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun, and it might be among the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Barnard's Star rotates just once every 130 days (compared with just over 25-30 days for the Sun). In 1998 astronomers saw an intense flare, showing that Barnard's Star is a 'flare star'. Barnard's Star has the variable star designation V2500 Ophiuchi.\nThe proper motion of Barnard's Star is 'sideways' relative to our line of sight to the Sun of 90\u00a0kilometers per second (km/s). The 10.3 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime, roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon.\nThe radial velocity of Barnard's Star towards the Sun can be measured by its blue shift. These measurements, combined with proper motion, suggest a true velocity relative to the Sun of about 140\u00a0km/s.\nWhile Barnard's Star has the largest proper motion, the largest known true velocity of another star in the Milky Way belongs to Wolf 424 at 555\u00a0km/s.\nBarnard's Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around AD 11,700, when it approaches to within about 3.8 light-years. However, at that time, it will \"not\" be the nearest star, since Proxima Centauri will have moved even closer to the Sun. Barnard's Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye at the time of its closest approach, since its apparent magnitude will be about 8.5 then. After that it will gradually recede from the Sun."}

It is known for its longevity and spreading crown. \nThe species name derives from its historical distribution eastward from the Balkans, where it was recognized in ancient Greek history and literature. Following Greek usage it is called \"Platane\" or related names in Europe. It was equally as famous to the Iranian-speaking world and from Turkey to Occupied Kashmir is called \"Chenar\" or related names, following the Iranian. \nThe native range of the Oriental plane is Eurasia from the Balkans to as far east as at least Iran. Some accounts extend its native range to Iberia in the west, and to the Himalayas in the east. \nThe oriental plane is found naturally in riverine settings, together with such trees as alder, willow and poplar. However, it is quite capable of survival and success in dry soils once it is established. In Kashmir it is recognised as the State tree of the region."}

{"id": "304539", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304539", "title": "Classical Chinese", "text": "Classical Chinese or literary Chinese is a traditional register of written Chinese. It is based on the grammar and vocabulary of ancient Chinese, so it is very different from any modern spoken form of Chinese. Classical Chinese was once used for almost all formal writing before and during the beginning of the 20th century in China, and during various different periods in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. Among Chinese speakers, Classical Chinese has been largely replaced by written vernacular Chinese, or \u767d\u8bdd/\u767d\u8a71 \"b\u00e1ihu\u00e0\" (\"plain speech\") after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and therefore the end of Imperial China. Written Vernacular Chinese is a writing style very closely related to modern spoken Mandarin Chinese. At the same time, non-Chinese speakers have largely given up Classical Chinese, and use their local languages or dialects instead.\nAlthough many words and phrases used in Classical Chinese have been replaced by words and phrases made up of different characters in Standard Chinese, many of the characters that were common in Classical Chinese can be found in modern Chinese words and phrases as well as retain their meanings. For example, while the word \"to eat\" is \u98df (sh\u00ed) in Classical Chinese, it is \u5403 (ch\u012b) in Standard Chinese. However, the character \u98df is still found in words related to food and eating like \u98df\u54c1 (sh\u00edp\u012dn), which is the Standard Chinese word for \"food\". The chart below compares Classical Chinese words to the Standard Chinese words that replaced them. \nMany modern Chinese words and phrases either came from northern dialects or are loanwords from other languages such as Mongolian or Korean.\nDue to the changes of the spoken Chinese over the centuries, spoken Chinese lost many sounds that existed in older dialects, and therefore many words in Classical Chinese were beginning to sound too much like each other. Although documents written in Classical Chinese can be reasonably understood by someone who can read Chinese, they can be very difficult to understand when they are read aloud. One-syllable articles, or poems written in Classical Chinese in which every word in the poem is pronounced by the same syllable, are perfect examples that how impractical Classic is as a spoken language. The title of one poem \u65bd\u6c0f\u98df\u72ee\u53f2 (\"Sh\u012b Sh\u00ec Sh\u00ed Sh\u012b Sh\u01d0\"), known as the \"Lion-Eating Poet of the Stone Den\" in English, literally translates to \"The Story of Shi Shi Eating Lions\". Every single word of the poem is pronounced \"shi\", even though they have different tones. If the title were to be translated into Standard Chinese, it be read something like \u65bd\u6c0f\u5403\u72ee\u5b50\u7684\u53f2\u8bd7 (Sh\u012b Sh\u00ec ch\u012b sh\u012bzi de sh\u01d0sh\u012b\")\".\nStructurally, words in Classical Chinese tend to be much simpler because they are usually made up of one Chinese character, while in Standard Chinese most words are made of two to four characters. This is so that the writer can write what they want to write using as few characters as possible. Examples are found below.\nOnce again, due to the merging of Chinese sounds, extra characters are added to words in Standard Chinese to distinguish similar-sounding words that would otherwise be impossible to tell apart.\nExamples of phrases in Classical Chinese is Confucius's famous quote \u6709\u6559\u7121\u985e (y\u01d2u ji\u00e0o w\u00fa l\u00e8i), which roughly translates to, \"In education, there should be no class distinction.\""}

Direct-broadcast satellites transmit many television channels.\nSatellite based communication systems can be used for voice and data transmission in remote and underserved locations such as ships at sea. Satellite internet access is internet access provided through satellites. Satellite based systems can be used for providing high quality broadband internet connection to businesses.\nHerman Poto\u010dnik (writing as 'Herman Noordung') was the first to propose that space stations use radio to communicate with Earth. In October 1945 Arthur C. Clarke published an article titled \"Extraterrestrial relays\" in the British magazine \"Wireless World\". The article described artificial satellites in geostationary orbits to relay radio signals. So, Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the communications satellite.\nPrimitive communication satellites were tested in the early 1960s.

But it did not happen because people did not want the route number to be removed.\nRoute description.\nDE 82 heads to the west of DE 52 near Greenville as Campbell Road. The road has two lanes cars can travel on without a median, which is a physical divider between the travel lanes in each direction. East of DE 52, the road continues to DE 100 as Kirk Road. The road passes areas of homes with trees and fields. Then it crosses over the Hoopes Reservoir. Not far after the reservoir, DE 82 makes a left turn onto New London Road to go south. The route passes through large areas of trees, turning to the west as it makes many turns. The road goes near more fields and homes in a rural area before coming to an intersection with Mt. Cuba Road. Here, DE 82 goes northwest on Creek Road and passes next to the Red Clay Creek and the Wilmington and Western Railroad on a road with many trees. It makes more turns and goes over the creek two times before crossing the railroad two times. In this area, the route passes the Ashland Nature Center. The route comes to the community of Yorklyn, where the route turns southwest for a short time and passes a few buildings in rural areas. After making a turn to the northwest to go on Creek Road, DE 82 heads north next to the Red Clay Creek. The Wilmington and Western Railroad turns to the southwest away from the road. A short distance past Yorklyn, the route comes to the Pennsylvania border, where it becomes PA 82 and goes toward Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. All of DE 82 is a part of the Red Clay Valley Scenic Byway, a scenic byway (road) name given to many roads in the Red Clay Creek valley.\nHistory.\nWhen Delaware started giving numbers to state highways in the 1930s, the road that is DE 82 today did not have a number. By 1952, DE 82 was made on the road it follows today to go between PA 82 to DE 52 near Greenville. DE 82 became part of the Red Clay Valley Scenic Byway, the second scenic byway in Delaware, in 2005. In 2010, DelDOT planned to remove the DE 82 signs in order to keep the route as a scenic byway. After a public workshop on the proposed sign removal was held, DelDOT decided in April 2010 to keep the DE 82 signs because \npeople in the area did not like the plan to remove the signs.\nMajor intersections.\nThe entire route is in New Castle County."}

The Delaware Department of Transportation is responsible for taking care of the numbered roads in Delaware. State routes in Delaware use a highway sign that has the numbers in a white circle on a black square. Delaware's numbering system is like that of the U.S. Highways in that odd numbered highways (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) travel north-south and even numbered routes (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0) go east-west. The numbers get bigger as one goes south and west respectively. There are some numbers that do not follow this, however, mostly with routes from other states keeping their number as they enter Delaware.\nHistory.\nThe first numbered routes in Delaware came in 1925 with the creation of the U.S. Highway System, in which US 13, US 40, and US 113 were made by law to run through the state. In 1930 and again in 1932, the Delaware State Highway Department suggested giving numbers to state roads to go along with the existing U.S. Highway System. By 1936, Delaware began giving numbers to state routes. In 1956, the Interstate Highway System was made, with under 40\u00a0miles of Interstate highway made by law in New Castle County."}

It comes from Yogyakarta, Semarang, and Surakarta. It can now be found in many places. It is a small serving of rice with different toppings. Often the toppings include chili sauce, dried fish, and tempeh. It is wrapped in banana leaves. \nName origin.\nThe name \"nasi kucing\", which means \"cat rice\" or \"cat's rice\", comes from the size of the rice served. There is very little rice, almost like what a Javanese person would give to a cat.\nOrigin.\n\"Nasi kucing\" was first served in Yogyakarta, Semarang, and Surakarta. Now it can be found in many places. It can be found in Jakarta and even Mecca; in Mecca it is sold by Indonesian workers during the hajj.\nServing.\nThe rice part of \"nasi kucing\" is small, about as big as a fist. It is served with different toppings. The toppings often include \"sambal\" (chili sauce), dried fish, and tempeh. Sometimes the toppings can be egg, chicken, and cucumber. It is able to be eaten immediately after it is bought. It is served wrapped in a banana leaf and paper. \nAnother version of \"nasi kucing\", called \"sego macan\" (meaning \"tiger's rice\") is three times the size of a regular portion of \"nasi kucing\". \"Sego macan\" is served with roasted rice, dried fish, and vegetables. Like \"nasi kucing\", \"sego macan\" is served wrapped in a banana leaf and paper.\nSales.\n\"Nasi kucing\" is often sold at a low price. Sometimes \"nasi kucing\" can be as cheap as Rp 1000 (US$ 0.12). \"Sego macan\" can be about Rp 4000 (US$ 0.48). It is often sold at small food stalls called \"angkringan\", which are located at the side of many roads. The customers are often poorer people, including pedicab and taxi drivers, students, and street musicians. This has led to \"angkringan\" being called the \"lowest class of eatery\".\nThe owners of the \"angkringan\" often come from poorer families, may have few skills that can be used to find a job, or come from far-away villages. To open their stalls, they borrow money from a patron, called a \"juragan\". They may borrow up to Rp 900,000.00 (US$ 105.00). The seller must repay the patron from the net profits of Rp 15,000.00 \u2013 Rp 20,000.00 (US$ 1.75 \u2013 2.35) a day."}

They are also known as the blowfish, fugu, swellfish, and globefish. They are called the pufferfish because when they are threatened, they puff up to about twice their normal size by gulping water. In this enlarged state, the pufferfish can swim at only about half their normal speed. Pufferfish are generally believed to be the second-most poisonous vertebrates in the world, after the golden poison frog. They use tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin.\nMost pufferfish are found in sub-tropical and tropical marine waters (including coral reefs) in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Some puffers live in brackish and fresh water. \nThe scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey.\nEven though pufferfish are poisonous, the meat of some species is eaten in Japan (as \u6cb3\u8c5a, pronounced 'fugu'), Korea (as \ubcf5 bok or \ubcf5\uc5b4 bogeo ), and China (as \u6cb3\u8c5a h\u00e9t\u00fan). It is prepared by specially trained chefs who know which parts, and how much of them, are safe to eat.\nSome people also keep pufferfish as pets."}

For this reason it is often called the 'love hormone'.\nStrange to say, the oxytocin released by the pituitary gland cannot reach the brain: it does have effects on the rest of the body. The reason is that there is a blood\u2013brain barrier which prevents large molecules from getting into the brain. Instead, the hormone is produced by special nerve cells inside the brain. \nOxytocin is also released through the use of recreational drugs like MDMA and some prescription anti-depressants.\nOxytocin was the first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced and synthesized, by Vincent du Vigneaud and colleagues in 1953."}

{"id": "304750", "revid": "878401", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304750", "title": "Pyramid scheme", "text": "A pyramid scheme is a way of making money that cannot continue very long. It involves promising people payment, services or ideals, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme or training them to take part. It does not supply any real investment or sale of products or services to the public. Pyramid schemes are a form of fraud. For this reason, pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries. \nThis type of scheme has existed for at least a century (100 years). The way the scheme is described is sometimes changed to hide what it is doing. Many people believe that multilevel marketing (MLM) is also a pyramid scheme.\nConcept and basic models.\nA successful pyramid scheme combines a business that seems real with a simple-to-understand money-making description which is used for profit. The idea is that the first person, Mr. X, makes a payment. To get money, Mr. X has to recruit others like him who will also make a payment. Mr. X gets paid out of money received from those new people (recruits). The recruits go on to involve others. As each new recruit makes a payment, Mr. X gets a part. He is promised always increasing benefits as the \"business\" expands.\nSuch \"businesses\" do not have real products or services. To make them more believable, most such scams have fake letters from successful members and information. Only the first person (sometimes called the \"pharaoh\") and a very few at the top levels of the pyramid make a lot of money. The amounts get much smaller further down the pyramid. Someone at the bottom of the pyramid loses money. They paid to enter, but cannot get anyone else to join.\nThe \"Eight-Ball\" model.\nRecruiting a large number of others into a scheme can be difficult so a system is used that seems more simple. In this model each person must recruit only two others. However, a larger number of levels is needed before the person gets paid any money. The scheme requires a person to recruit two others, who must each recruit two others, who must each recruit two others. \nThe \"eight-ball\" model contains a total of fifteen members. This scheme has been called the \"Airplane Game\" and the four tiers labelled as \"captain,\" \"co-pilot,\" \"crew,\" and \"passenger\" to denote a person's level. \nSuch schemes may hide their pyramid nature by calling themselves as \"gifting circles\" with money being \"gifted.\" The eight passengers must each pay (or \"gift\") a sum (e.g. $1,000) to join the scheme. This total of $8,000 goes to the captain who leaves the scheme. Everyone remaining moves up one level. There are now two new captains so the group splits in two with each group requiring eight new passengers. A person who joins the scheme as a passenger will not get any money until they advance through the crew and co-pilot levels to captain. Therefore, the participants in the bottom 3 tiers of the pyramid lose their money if the scheme collapses. Popular schemes such as the \"Women Empowering Women\" do this."}

BMW entered several races in the 1950s and 1960s. Often, they ran using the Formula Two rules. In the 1980s, they built the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine. This engine was built for the Brabham team. Nelson Piquet won the championship driving a Brabham-BMW. BMW also supplied the M12/13 engine to the ATS, Arrows, Benetton and Ligier teams. In , Brabham left F1 for the season, and BMW stopped its official backing of the engines. Arrows still used the engine with the Megatron name. When Formula One banned turbocharged engines in , the M12/13 could no longer be used.\nBMW returned to Formula One in . They made a deal to supply engines to only the Williams team. The engine was a new V10 engine. The engine deal with Williams ended after the season. BMW then bought the rival Sauber team. The BMW Sauber project lasted from until . Sauber, a former privateer team, became more competitive. In , Robert Kubica won the team's only race, the Canadian Grand Prix, with Nick Heidfeld finishing second. After the 2009 season, BMW withdrew from F1. They sold the team back to its founder, Peter Sauber.\nEntries in the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe early years of the World Drivers' Championship saw private BMW racing cars, based on the pre-war BMW 328 chassis. They were entered in the German Grands Prix in and . A modified 328 with a rear engine became standard in Formula One in the early 1960s. It was known as the \"Heck\", the German automotive term for \"back\" or \"rear\". This design later found success with the Cooper team.\nIn German Grand Prix, BMW entered Hubert Hahne in a Lola chassis powered by an larger BMW engine, and David Hobbs in the Lola with the standard smaller BMW engine. For the German Grand Prix, Hahne returned and finished tenth, BMW's best result in Formula One to that date. BMW then entered three of its own 269 F2 chassis for the German Grand Prix for Hahne, Gerhard Mitter and Dieter Quester. Mitter was killed in a practice accident. The remaining BMW team withdrew from the race. BMW left F1 for a number of years.\nEngine supplier.\nBrabham, ATS, Arrows, Benetton and Ligier (1982\u20131988).\nIn , Renault entered Formula One with a turbocharged engine. After the success Renault had, BMW decided to develop its own turbo engine. BMW announced the new program in April 1980. The engine was based on the BMW M10, a four-cylinder, 1.5\u00a0litre, normally aspirated (non-turbocharged) engine designed in the late 1950s. The racing version, the M12, had been successful in Formula Two and other series. The prototype 1.4\u00a0litre turbo engine soon developed 600\u00a0bhp. It used a single K\u00fchnle, Kopp &amp; Kausch (KKK) turbocharger, Bosch electronics, and fuel injection. This engine was developed into the M12/13, the race engine BMW supplied to five teams from 1982 to 1988.\nBMW first made a deal to supply the M12/13 engine only to the Brabham. Testing of the M12/13 started in late 1980. A new car, Brabham BT50 was design for the engine. The new car was not finished until will into the season. The team's lead driver, Nelson Piquet, tested the BT50 throughout 1981. The car was unreliable until Bosch improved the electronics.\nBrabham began the 1982 season with two BMW-powered BT50 chassis. Because of reliability problems, the BT50 was not used at all the races that year. BMW saw their first win in Canadian Grand Prix, where the cool conditions helped the turbocharged engine. The BT50 was used for the rest of the season. The car was still unreliable, and the drivers only made four finishes the rest of the season.\nIn , the reliability of the BMW engine was improved. The new Brabham BT52 allowed Nelson Piquet to win the Drivers' Championship. Brabham finished third in the Constructors' Championship. BMW also began supplying its engines to the German ATS team this season. Manfred Winkelhock, the only driver for the team, was unable to score any points.\nFor , BMW expanded to three teams, supplying the M12/13 to Arrows. In , BMW was back to two teams. ATS had left Formula One. Piquet won one race, the French Grand Prix. It was the only win for BMW that year.\nFor the 1986 season, BMW was back to three teams with the addition of Benetton. Benetton had the most success, scoring 19 points, and winning the Mexican Grand Prix. In , BMW only supplied Brabham with works engines. Arrows and Ligier used the \"Megatron\", a rebadged BMW engine. At the end of the year, Benetton team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided not to compete the following year. This ended the BMW turbo engine. The Arrows team still used the \"Megatrons\" engine for . They finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship, their best finish in the team's 25-year history.\nFor , the technical regulations were changed to ban turbocharged engines. During the M12/13 engine's time in F1, the engine had won the 1983 Drivers' Championship and nine Grands Prix. It also took 14 pole positions and set 13 fastest laps.\nWilliams (2000\u20132005).\nWilliams had been very successful using Renault engines. They won the , , and Drivers' Championships. They also won the , , , and Constructors' Championships. When Renault left F1 at the end of 1997, Williams needed a new engine. In , the BMW signed a contract to supply the Williams team with engines.\nBMW spent 18 months building and testing a normally aspirated, 3.0\u00a0litre V10 engine. The E41 engine was ready to race in the 2000 season. The Williams FW22 with the BMW E41 engine was driven by Ralf Schumacher and Jenson Button. Schumacher scored a podium finish in the engine's first race. The team finished the year with two more podium finishes, and third in the Constructors' Championship.\nFor , BMW designed a more aggressive P80 engine. The engine had a big power improvement. Schumacher and new team-mate Juan Pablo Montoya scored four race wins. For , the team won only one race with Schumacher at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Montoya took seven pole positions, but was not able to win a single race.\nThe Williams team was more competitive in . Both drivers won on two time. For , Williams produced the FW26 chassis with a radical nose section. This design did not work very well. Williams slipped to fourth in the Constructors' Championship. Montoya's victory in the Brazilian Grand Prix the team's only win (and the team's final win to date). Both Schumacher and Montoya left the team at the end of the season.\n was the final year of Williams using the BMW engine. The team continued to be less competitive. None of the team's drivers were able to win a race. By this time, BMW was upset with Williams. BMW thought the engine was able to win, and the Williams chassis was the problem. BMW offered to buy Williams outright. They wanted to gain overall control of its Formula One efforts. Frank Williams would not sell the team. BMW chose to buy the rival Sauber team instead for and end its deal with Williams.\nBMW Sauber.\nBMW bought Swiss team Sauber in June 2005 to form the BMW Sauber F1 Team. The takeover came after BMW's relationship with Williams had deteriorated in the previous months, the partnership ending at the end of the season. The team was based at Sauber's headquarters in Hinwil, Switzerland and BMW's headquarters in Munich, Germany.\nThe team scored two podium finishes and came fifth in 2006, its first season in Formula One. This was followed by a second place in 2007 after the McLaren team had been excluded from the championship. Polish driver Robert Kubica took the team's only Grand Prix victory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. Following a poor season, BMW withdrew from Formula One and sold the team back to founder Peter Sauber.\n2006.\nFor the 2006 season, BMW Sauber signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be the lead driver, while World Champion Jacques Villeneuve had his existing two-year contract with Sauber honoured. Robert Kubica was signed as the team's third driver. The team continued to use Sauber's facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing, while BMW's headquarters in Munich were responsible for building the new 2.4 litre P86 V8 engine, revised technical regulations forcing a change from the 3 litre V10 formula. This replaced the Petronas-badged Ferrari engines which the team had used since 1997. The Sauber team's existing major sponsors, Petronas and Credit Suisse, renewed their contracts with BMW. The team also announced a technical partnership with technology company Intel. The team's new livery, which was maintained throughout its tenure in Formula One, consisted of the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red.\nVilleneuve scored the team's first points with a seventh-place finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix, after Heidfeld retired from fifth with an engine failure late in the race. Over the first two thirds of the season the drivers picked up points with a succession of seventh and eighth-place finishes, plus a fourth-place finish for Heidfeld at the Australian Grand Prix. The team ran a radical \"twin towers\" aero enhancement on the front of the car for the French Grand Prix, which was meant improve the flow of air over the top of the chassis. The parts were promptly banned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) as they were adjudged to impede the drivers' vision and thus compromise safety.\nHeidfeld scored the team's first podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix from tenth on the grid. This race also saw the d\u00e9but of Robert Kubica, who replaced Villeneuve after the latter had crashed heavily at the preceding German Grand Prix. Kubica finished seventh, although he was later disqualified after his car was found to be underweight. The official reason for Villeneuve's absence was that he was recovering from his previous accident, but the team later announced that the driver change was permanent. Kubica scored BMW Sauber's second podium finish of the season at the Italian Grand Prix, after running in third place for most of the race and leading briefly during the first round of pit stops. Heidfeld finished in eighth, but set the team's first fastest lap. The team scored a total of 36 points to finish fifth in the Constructors' Championship, an improvement on Sauber's eighth position with 20 points in .\n2007.\nOn 19 October 2006, BMW announced that Robert Kubica would partner Nick Heidfeld for the 2007 Formula One season with Sebastian Vettel taking the test and reserve driver role. Timo Glock was later signed as the team's second test driver. The team launched its 2007 car, the F1.07, on January 16, 2007.\nThe new car showed promising form throughout winter testing, topping the times sheets on occasions. However, team principal Mario Theissen declared some reliability concerns before the season's opening race in Australia. Kubica retired from fourth place with a gearbox problem, but Heidfeld took over the position and held it to the end of the race. In the early races of the season, Heidfeld and Kubica scored a series of points finishes and established BMW Sauber as the third-fastest team, behind Ferrari and McLaren. Theissen also made the point that the performance gap between BMW Sauber and the two top teams was less than the gap between BMW Sauber and the teams behind it.\nThe Canadian Grand Prix brought mixed fortunes for the team. While Heidfeld scored BMW Sauber's best result thus far with a second-place finish, Kubica suffered a huge crash that resulted in a long safety car period. The media was initially told Kubica had broken his leg, but it later proved that he had escaped with only a sprained ankle and concussion. Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix, finishing in eighth place and therefore becoming the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point. Later in the season, Vettel moved teams to take a race seat at the Toro Rosso team.\nKubica returned to racing action at the French Grand Prix and proved his recovery by finishing in fourth position. Over the remainder of the season, he and Heidfeld continued their form to score a total of 101 points, which secured the team second in the Constructors' Championship after McLaren's disqualification. Heidfeld scored another podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix and scored 61 points to Kubica's 39, while Vettel's sole appearance produced an additional point.\n2008.\nOn August 21, 2007, BMW confirmed its driver line-up of Heidfeld and Kubica for the season.\nTheir 2008 car, the F1.08 was officially launched in Munich at BMW Welt on January 14, 2008. It made its track debut at Valencia the next day, with Robert Kubica driving. Team principal Mario Theissen set the target of the team's first win.\nBMW Sauber started the season well with Kubica narrowly missing out on pole after a mistake in his main qualifying lap in Melbourne. He later retired after being hit by Kazuki Nakajima but Heidfeld finished second. Kubica took second in Malaysia, with Heidfeld in 6th setting the fastest lap of the race. The team's points total of 11 was their largest score up to that time. In Bahrain, Kubica scored his and the team's first ever pole position, beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race, equalling their highest round points total and promoting them to first place in the constructors' championship for the first time.\nThe team also attained a second-place finish in the Monaco Grand Prix with Robert Kubica, beating both Ferraris and only trailing the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton by three seconds.\nBMW Sauber's first race victory came in the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, the team achieving a one-two finish with Robert Kubica's first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. The victory came after Lewis Hamilton collided with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in the pitlane, ending the race for both drivers. Kubica was on a different refueling strategy from Heidfeld, who also briefly led the race before securing the one-two finish for BMW Sauber in comfortable fashion.\nAfter the team's breakthrough win, development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations come into play. This greatly annoyed Kubica, (who was leading the championship after the Canadian Grand Prix), as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title. The lack of development was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season, causing BMW to be outpaced by Renault, Toyota and even Toro Rosso (who started the season as one of the slowest teams) by the end of the season. Despite this, Kubica remained with an outside chance of taking the drivers championship until the Chinese Grand Prix, the 17th round out of 18.\nIn October the team confirmed that they would stick with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the Season.\n2009.\nAlthough BMW Sauber targeted the season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was a disappointment. Kubica was running in 3rd place in the opening round when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place and was forced to retire. Heidfeld then secured the team's first podium of the year in Malaysia, but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected a mere 6 points, and occupied 8th place in the Constructors' Championship out of 10 teams. A raft of upgrades were set for Turkey, including an improved regenerative braking system (KERS) and a double deck diffuser. While the new diffuser was implemented, the KERS could not be made to fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. After the qualifying session for the British Grand Prix Mario Theissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development KERS; of which BMW had been one of the strongest proponents, and focus instead on improving the car's aerodynamics. This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the team's first points since the race in Turkey.\nFollowing a meeting of the BMW board on July 28, the company held at press conference the following morning in which it confirmed the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009. Chairman Dr Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one. The Formula One Teams Association released a statement in response pledging its support to help the team remain in F1.\nOn 15 September 2009 it was announced that BMW Sauber had secured a buyer, Qadbak Investments Limited which said to represent European and Middle Eastern interests. However Lotus had been given the 13th and final slot in the 2010 Championship. The team were awarded what was termed a 14th entry, which hinges either on another team dropping out or all the other teams agreeing to allow 28 cars to enter the 2010 Championship.\nOn November 22, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung revealed that Qadbak's attempt to purchase the team had failed as it did not have the necessary funds. Qadbak turned out to be a shell company with no assets and no investors behind it. On November 27, 2009 it was announced that Peter Sauber would repurchase the team conditional upon the team receiving a FIA entry for the 2010 season. The FIA subsequently granted Sauber an entry on December 3. The team used Ferrari engines in .\nThe team retained the BMW Sauber name for the season, despite using Ferrari engines."}

Similarly, \"odd\" (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) route numbers are given to north/south routes, with the smaller numbered routes in the west (I-5) and the bigger numbered routes in the east (I-95). Routes that end in a 0 or a 5 are major routes in the system. These Interstates generally go from coast to coast or from the bottom to the top of the U.S. For example, Interstate 5 goes from the Mexican Border at San Diego, California to the Canadian Border at Blaine, Washington. Likewise, Interstate 10, the southernmost cross-country Interstate Highway, goes from Santa Monica, California on the west coast to Jacksonville, Florida on the east coast. The longest Interstate Highway in the United States is Interstate 90.\nThere are five sets of numbers that are used more than once throughout the system; the highways whose numbers are used more than once are separated by big distances to avoid confusion. Below, these are made separate from each other by West and East.\nThree-digit Interstates are spur or loop Interstates that usually are in big cities and areas outside of cities. The last two digits of a three-digit Interstate are always the number of the route it is related to. If the first digit is \"odd\" (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), the Interstate is usually a spur route while if the first digit is \"even\" (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0), the Interstate is usually a loop route. \nPrimary Interstates.\nA total of 67 primary Interstates are in the table below, with 43 of them having three-digit routes. The lengths in the table are as of December 31, 2013.\nRoutes ending in 0 or 5 are marked in green.\nInterstates outside of the mainland.\nInterstate Highways are not only in the 48 states of the United States that border, but there are also Interstates in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico.\nHawaiian Interstates.\nThe Interstate Highways in the island of Oahu, Hawaii are signed with the normal Interstate shield, with the letter \"H-\" added before the number. They are fully controlled-access routes built to the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States.\nAlaska and Puerto Rico.\nThe Federal Highway Administration gives money to four routes in Alaska and three routes in Puerto Rico under the same program as the rest of the Interstate Highway System. However, these routes do not have to meet the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States.\nAlaska.\nAlaska's Interstates do not have signs to mark them, although they all have state highway numbers that are not the same as the Interstate numbers.\nPuerto Rico.\nLike Alaska, Puerto Rico signs its Interstates as territorial routes, and the numbers are not the same as their official Interstate designations. Many of the territory's routes are freeway-standard toll roads."}

He was nicknamed \"The Flying Dutchman\" because he was German and very fast. He played in the National League from 1897 to 1917. He played for the Louisville Colonels for two years, and then for the Pittsburgh Pirates for 17 years. Wagner won eight batting titles, the most in National League history. He held the league record for slugging percentage six times, and the record for stolen bases five times.\nHe was inducted (added to) the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936. He was one of the first five members of the hall of fame. He received the second-highest vote total to be added. Ty Cobb is the only person to get more votes. Babe Ruth tied with Wagner for second-highest.\nMost historians think that Ty Cobb is the greatest player of the dead-ball era. But some think that Wagner was a better all-around player. Most baseball historians think that Wagner was the greatest shortstop ever. Cobb said that Wagner was \"maybe the greatest star ever to take the diamond.\"\nEarly life.\nJohannes Wagner was born on February 24, 1874 in the Chartiers neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Chartiers is now part of Carnegie, Pennsylvania.) His parents were Peter and Katheryn Wagner. His father was a coal miner and his mother was a housewife. Both of his parents were German immigrants.\nWagner was one of five children. His mother called him Hans as a child. This name evolved (change into over time) into Honus. When he was 12, Wagner dropped out of school to work in the coal mines with his father. In their free time, Honus and his brothers played sandlot baseball. They became so good that three of Honus's brothers also became professional baseball players.\nHonus's older brother, Albert \"Butts\" Wagner, was a professional baseball player. In 1895, he was playing for the Inter-State League. He got Honus a tryout with the league.\nIn 1894, Honus married Bessie Baine Smith. They had three daughters: Elva Katrina (b. 1918), Betty Baine (b. 1919), and Virginia Mae (b. 1922).\nMinor league career.\nHonus started playing for the Inter-State League in 1895. He played for five different teams in his first year. The towns he played for were Steubenville, Akron, Mansfield, Adrian, and Warren.\nEd Barrow, a manager from the Atlantic League, saw Honus play. He convinced Honus to come play for the Paterson Silk Weavers of Paterson, New Jersey. In 1896, Wagner had a batting average of .313. In 1897, Wagner played 74 games and hit .375."}

Until 1920, this city was the northernmost city of the German Empire. \nThe city's history is complicated. The Port of Klaip\u0117da is important in the area. It is a usually ice-free port on the Baltic Sea.

Bytecode is a set of computer instructions for a processor that only exists on paper. \nThe alternative to a JIT is an interpreter that looks at each bytecode instruction individually and then decides what to with it. When you run over the same part of the program again, an interpreter has to make the decisions again. While a JIT makes the decisions on how to handle the bytecode once, and then stores it as native processor instructions (this takes memory). Properly deciding how to translate bytecode take some time, so you have some minor slowdown in startup speed. A proper modern JIT first runs a regular interpreter, and then does the JIT step once it knows something is used frequently."}

{"id": "305021", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305021", "title": "Scallop", "text": "A scallop is a marine bivalve mollusc of the family Pectinidae. Scallops live in all the world's oceans.\nThis is one of the largest families of living bivalves. There are over 300 living species of scallop. Their main adaptation is the ability to swim by clapping their valves together. In this way they escape from most of their predators.\nThey have a good reputation as a food source. As bivalves they have one hinged shell; each half is known as a valve. The lower valve is usually white (about 95%). It can also be orange (4%) or Lemon Yellow (1%).\nThe name \"scallop\" comes from the Old French \"escalope\", which means \"shell\". Their shells can be up to 15 centimetres (6 inches) across.\nMain features.\n1. Their ability to swim. However, a few species attach to rocks as adults by a filament. Most species lie on sandy beds, and swim off when touched by a starfish or other predator.\n2. They have eyes round the edges of their mantle. Their eyes cannot see shapes, but they can detect changing patterns of light and motion.\n The scallop eyes fringing the edge of its shell detect moving objects as they pass successive eyes.\n3. Semi-circular ridged shape to the shell. The valves are similar, and fit closely together to make a tight-fitting shell.\n4. At some stage in their lives, all scallops all have a ridge of tiny teeth near the notch where the byssus comes out in other bivalves. This is called the \"ctenolium\". Its importance is that only scallops have it, and it can be seen in fossils. So that tells palaeontologists when they have a fossil scallop.\nMuscles.\nScallops have a central adductor muscle. This is the same as true oysters (family Ostreidae). The inside of their shell has a scar in the middle. This shows where this muscle attaches to the shell. The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than the adductor muscle of oysters. This is because they swim.\nFood and digestion.\nMost scallops are filter feeders. They eat plankton. The plankton sometimes has scallop larvae in it. Siphons bring water over a filtering structure. Mucus then traps the food. Next, the cilia on the structure moves the food to the mouth. Then, the scallop digests the food in the stomach and digestive gland. Waste goes through the intestine and exits through the anus.\nLife cycle.\nSome scallops, such as the Atlantic bay scallop \"Argopecten irradians\" do not live for a long time. Others can live 20 years or more.\nOne can estimate their age from the annuli, the concentric rings on their shells.\nThe scallop family is unusual because of the variety in arrangements for sexual reproduction. In some species, a scallop has only one sex. They are either male or female. Other species are hermaphrodites so a single scallop has both male and female reproductive organs at the same time. A few scallops are male when they are young and they become female when they grow older.\nRed roe comes from female scallops. White roe comes from males. Scallops release Spermatozoa and ova freely into the water during the mating season. Fertilized ova sink to the bottom. The immature scallop hatches after a few weeks. The larvae drift in the plankton until they go to the bottom again to grow. They may attach by means of byssal threads.\nFossil record.\nThere are many Pectinidae species, living and fossil. True Pectinidae (ones with a \"ctenolium\") first appeared in the Upper or Middle Triassic over 200 million years ago (mya), and perhaps as early as 240 mya.\nThe Pectinidae family had a large number of species in the Mesozoic era, but they almost disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous period. The survivors evolved rapidly during the Tertiary period. There are nearly 7,000 species and subspecies for the fossil and recent Pectinidae.\nEvolution.\nThe evolution of bivalves that swim is a consequence of the so-called \"Mesozoic marine revolution\". In the Mesozoic era sea-floor predators evolved various new forms which fed on the abundant shellfish (brachiopods and bivalves). These predators are still abundant today: they are mostly the starfish, the gastropods, and the crabs.\nEach predator has its own methods. Crabs break the shells by force. Some gastropods make holes in the shell and put in a paralysing or relaxing substance; others work on small cracks in the edge of the shell. Once they get their proboscis in, they eat the shellfish.\nStarfish are the most common predators. The shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and hydraulic system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit. Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell. The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm. The starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives, absorbing the nutrients.\nConsequently, there was a great reproductive advantage for any prey which had even the slightest defence to these predators. Many shellfish developed extra-tough shells. Some burrowed into the sand. Scallops must had had some elementary movement, which developed rapidly under selection. They became extremely common in the Mesozoic. There are some other methods used by a few scallops. \"Chlamys hastata\" often carry sponges on their shell. It is a kind of mutualism. The sponge makes it difficult for starfish to get their tube feet on, and camouflages \"Chlamys hastata\" from predators.\nWhen scallops move off the sand they are open to new predators such as rays, which patrol just above the ocean floor. They may also be picked up by seabirds which open shells by dropping them on rock. Evidently the main advantage lies in getting away from the starfish, which are very numerous on inshore and continental shelf habitats.\nOrigins.\nStudies have shown the Pectinidae family is monophyletic, developing from a single common ancestor. The direct ancestors of Pectinidae were scallop-like bivalves of the family Entoliidae.\nAs food.\nWild fisheries and aquaculture.\nThe largest wild scallop fishery is for the Atlantic sea scallop (\"Placopecten magellanicus\") off northeastern United States and eastern Canada. Most of the rest of the world's production of scallops is from Japan (wild, enhanced, and aquaculture), and China (mostly cultured Atlantic bay scallops). In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global scallop and pecten catch, according to a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study.\nCooking.\nScallops are popular in both Eastern and Western cooking. They have two types of meat in one shell. The adductor muscle is white and meaty. The roe, called \"coral\", is red, orange or white and soft.\nIn Western cuisine, scallops are often saut\u00e9ed in butter, or breaded and deep fried. The byssus (also called the beard) is often tough. It is usually discarded or used later on for stock. Sometimes, markets sell scallops already prepared in the shell, with only the adductor muscle. Outside the U.S. the scallop is often sold whole, and people eat the adductor muscle and roe.\nIn Japanese cuisine, scallops may be served in soup or prepared as sashimi or sushi. In a sushi bar, \"hotategai\" (\u5e06\u7acb\u8c9d, \u6d77\u6247) is the traditional scallop on rice. \"Kaibashira\" (\u8c9d\u67f1) might be scallop, but it can also be the adductor muscle of any kind of shellfish, such as mussels, oysters, or clams.\nIn Cantonese Chinese cuisine dried scallop is called conpoy (\u4e7e\u7464\u67f1, \u4e7e\u8c9d, \u5e72\u8c9d).\nSymbolism.\nShell of Saint James.\nThe scallop shell is the traditional emblem of James, son of Zebedee. It is popular with pilgrims on the Way of St James to the apostle's shrine at Santiago de Compostela in Spain.\nFertility symbol.\nThroughout antiquity, scallops and other hinged shells have symbolized the feminine principle. Many paintings of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and fertility, included a scallop shell in the painting to identify her. This is clear in Botticelli's classically inspired \"The Birth of Venus\"\nUse as a design.\nHeraldry included the scallop shell symbol as a badge for people who had made the pilgrimage to Compostela. Later it became a symbol of pilgrimage in general. Winston Churchill's family coat of arms includes scallops. However, symbols in heraldry do not always have the same meaning. Sometimes no family member has been on a pilgrimage but there are still scallops on the coat of arms.\nOver 45 communes of France have one or more scallop shells on their coat of arms.\nThe U.S. state of New York has had the Atlantic bay scallop as its state shell since 1988. In design, \"scalloped edges\" or \"ridges\" means a wavy pattern which reminds people of the edge of a scallop's shell. Shell petroleum company has had a logo with a scallop shell on it since 1904."}

He wanted to be chosen as the Democrat's Vice-Presidential nominee, but Lloyd Bentsen was chosen instead. From 1991 to 1997, he was a shadow senator from the District of Columbia. People thought Jackson might run against Bill Clinton in the 1996 primaries, but he did not. \nIn 2016, during the 2016 United States presidential election he endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. In 2020, during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he endorsed Bernie Sanders to be the democratic nominee. \nControversy.\nHe is known for saying some things that are controversial. Some things he said were offensive to Jews. He also said that Barack Obama was \"acting like he's white\" and \"talking down to black people.\"\nPersonal life.\nJackson's eldest son, Jesse Jackson Jr., is a former congressman from Illinois.\nIn November 2017, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\nIn August 2021, Jackson and his wife were hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, with COVID-19."}

These rocks were laid down just after the great Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event.\nThe Lower Triassic was called the Scythian stage, which can be found in older literature. In Europe, most of the Lower Triassic is composed of sandstone. It is a lithostratigraphic unit of continental red beds. They were formed on land under desert conditions.\nFauna.\nThe massive extinctions that ended the Paleozoic era caused extreme hardship for the surviving species. Many types of corals, brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderms, and other invertebrates had completely disappeared. The most common hard-shelled marine invertebrates were bivalves, gastropods, ammonites, echinoids, and a few articulate brachiopods. The most common land animal was the herbivorous synapsid \"Lystrosaurus\". \nThe earliest Triassic faunas lacked biodiversity and were like that throughout the epoch. Recovery on land took 30 million years. \nThe first ichthyosaurs evolved in this epoch.\nThe climate during the Lower Triassic (especially in the interior of the supercontinent Pangaea) was generally dry. Deserts were widespread. The poles had a temperate climate. The relatively hot climate of the epoch may have been caused by widespread volcanic eruptions."}

This 'Triassic takeover' may have contributed to the evolution of mammals. It forced the surviving therapsids and their mammalian successors to live as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores. Nocturnal life probably forced the proto-mammals to develop fur and higher metabolic rates. In their burrows, keeping warm, looking after the young and feeding them with milk were keys to their later success.\nThe ancestors of crocodiles, and the ancestors of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, were the most important archosaurs of this epoch.\nIn the Tethys Ocean, the first sauropterygia were present, the nothosaurs and early plesiosaurs.

He was the co-founder and balletmaster of the New York City Ballet. He was a choreographer known for his musicality. He often with Igor Stravinsky: 39 of his ballets were choreographed to music by Stravinsky.\nCareer.\nBalanchine was trained at the Imperial Ballet School in St Petersburg. After the Revolution he joined what is now the Mariinsky Ballet. He escaped when the company toured Germany. He was picked up by Sergei Diaghilev to be a dancer and choreographer for the Ballets Russes.\nAfter Diaghilev's death, Balanchine stayed in Europe until 1933. Then he was taken to New York by a wealthy patron, Lincoln Kirstein. Together they formed the American Ballet School. Later they formed the American Ballet Company. This company became the 'house' dance group of the New York Metropolitan Opera. Later, in 1938, Balanchine moved the company to Hollywood.\nIn 1948 he moved back to New York.

The tower is being built in Jeddah, a major port city on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. After its completion, Kingdom Tower will be the tallest building in the world, according to Construction Weekly. The consultants at Advanced Construction Technology Services state that the new tower will be approximately high, which is significantly taller than the current Guinness World Record holder, the Burj Khalifa. In contrast, the Burj Khalifa is only high.\nKingdom Tower will be the first part in a new project called Kingdom City, a planned suburb of Jeddah, with plans to eventually become a new city entirely. Plans for Kingdom Tower have been circulating since 2008, when it was originally named the \"Mile-High Tower,\" for the obvious reason that it was going to be a mile high. However, the foundation where the Kingdom Holding Company wanted to build the tower was not stable enough to support such a large project. Instead, the company settled for the kilometer high title, where on August 2, 2011, Kingdom Holding announced that construction would commence soon, as the support for the tower had finally been gathered. The idea of Kingdom Tower is accredited to the Prince of Saudi Arabia, Al-Waleed bin Talal, whom also owns Kingdom Holding Company. The prince is the main contributor to this project, as he is known to be one of the wealthiest men in the world.\nIssues.\nHowever, many people are complaining that the tower is going to be a waste of much needed capital. The government has many problems and issues that require the money of the Saudi Arabian government, such as improving education and providing jobs that will benefit the country as a whole. As such, there are some that believe the country cannot afford to pursue such a large project. Many believe that this project is an elitist venture made simply to compete with the already-failed Burj Khalifa, which is known to be almost completely empty. Saudi Arabians and immigrants alike fear that the project is going to be a failure in stimulating the lagging economy of Saudi Arabia, and will instead add to the debt of the country.\nStill, others also believe that the project will benefit the economy of Saudi Arabia, bringing in much needed jobs to help construct the building, and will bring in a large amount of tourism already concentrated within the Hejaz area where Jeddah resides."}

It makes sound by blowing air through reeds, which are tuned to different pitches to make musical notes.\nA harmonium can be made to work using either the feet or the hands:\nThe hand-pumped harmonium was created by Dwarkanath Ghose so that the instrument could be played while the player was sitting down on the floor. It is used in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and in other South Asian countries as an accompanying instrument in Hindustani classical music, Sufi Music, Bhajan and other devotional music, Qawwali, Natya Sangeet, and a variety of genres including accompaniment to Classical Kathak Dance and other entertainments.\nOthers began building similar instruments. In Vienna, Anton Haeckl constructed the physharmonica, a keyboard instrument filled with free reeds. John Green invented the seraphine, which produced music when air was blown over metallic reeds. Such instruments are now museum pieces.\nSpecial types.\nIt was first invented by Alexandre Debain in 1840 in France, who patented his Harmonium in Paris on August 9, 1840. Harmonium with a Swarmandal (a small, harp-like instrument, similar to Zither and Autoharp) was produced by Bhishmadev Vedi. As the Swarmandal box was too big for the Harmonium, his disciple Manohar Chimote fixed the strings within the breadth of the instrument naming it as \u2018Samvadini\u2019. This instrument allows the strings to be played by the hand on the bellows, and keys by the other hand. Chimote provided a new natural \u2018Gandhar\u2019 tuning in this Harmonium. Although this tuning was limited to the 12 tones versus the 22 required in Hindustani classical music, it surely gave the European tuning of the Harmonium, an Indian flavour.\n22-Shruti-Harmonium was created by Vidyadhar Oke (Indian Patent No. 250197). To achieve this, he first clarified the essential difference between 'Nada' and 'Shruti' and pinpointed the positions to play the 22 Microtones (Shrutis) on any string instrument. He documented the specific difference between 22 Shrutis versus the 12-Tone Equal temperament Scale. His 22-Shruti-Harmonium provides special knobs below each of the keys to regulate the reeds, making 22 Shrutis available within 12 keys. As this is a modified hand-pumped harmonium, no special playing skill is necessary. The 22-Shruti-Harmonium enables the creation of any Raga with all the notes perfectly consonant with a Tanpura. Additionally, by positioning all the knobs in the central position, the 22-Shruti-Harmonium can produce the sound of an Accordion."}

Usually, only men are conscripted, but in Some countries such as Israel and Norway, women are as well. A soldier who has been drafted to serve in the army is called a \"conscript\". \nConscription may or may not be compulsory. If compulsory, it may be resisted. Usually, exceptions are allowed. Since men in their late teens and twenties are the main objective, conscription clashes with higher education, and exceptions may be allowed.\nThe first large, modern conscript army was the French Grand Army after the French Revolution. Conscription soon became a common way of making up the armies. Almost all of the powerful armies in the world except United Kingdom were conscript armies, but during the World Wars, even the British Army used mostly conscripts. \nConscription was introduced in August 1916 in New Zealand during the First World War because the number of men needed to be recruited had not been met. \nProblems.\nConscription armies are large, but they are often poorly equipped and trained and have poor morale. In combat they usually suffer many casualties. Usually conscripts serve with little pay. Conscription may be considered as a type of forced labour. In some countries, young men who refuse to join the army are sentenced to prison. Many people \"dodged\" or illegally avoided conscription during the Vietnam War in the United States.\nThere are arguments for conscription. Some see it as fair since everyone shares the burden of service. A small country with few people can make up a large enough army by conscription. If a country is in the middleof hostile neighbours and war can break up at any time, or if the country is a \"buffer state\" (between two military powers), training all available young people as soldiers can be a good idea.\nThe alternatives for conscription are militia or universal conscription systems, as in Switzerland, or a professional army made up from volunteers. The United States gave up conscription during the Cold War. The Vietnam War proved so unpopular that the US Army no longer wanted conscripts, but volunteers, who have better motivation to serve. Most other Western countries followed the American example and gave up conscription. Some countries now have an all-volunteer army, and in Europe, universal conscription remains only in some countries like Finland, Russia and Turkey.\nIn Germany, conscription for the Bundeswehr was removed in July 2011 after a long discussion in the German Bundestag.\nPeople who oppose conscription because of pacifism idea are called conscientious objectors. Some countries draft conscientious objectors but give them jobs in which they will not have to fight. "}

Under UEFA rules, the club could not get a licence to play in the First Division in 2007. A separate club, Limerick 37, was formed to replace Limerick FC in the league and competed under this name for two seasons. Limerick 37 has been renamed as Limerick FC.

The Market's Field has always been considered to be the home of football in the city as the club enjoyed success at the venue and moving from there to Hogan Park heralded a serious decline in the club's fortunes.

In 12 matches they scored 7 goals and while the club never won a European game, it drew twice. One of those draws was at The Dell against a Southampton team that included former European Footballer of the Year Kevin Keegan and Mick Channon. In the home fixture famous rugby international Tony Ward played well against a Yugoslav international defender Ivan Golac.\nLimerick first competed in 1960 in the European Cup against Young Boys Berne, but suffered their heaviest aggregate defeat.

It is a boarding school, and 80% of the students live there. The school has 1.3 billion dollars, which is the most any school in New England has, and as much as many colleges do.\nPhillips Exeter Academy is one of the oldest private boarding school in the United States, and was founded in 1781, during the American Revolution, by John Phillips, as a school for only boys. The school opened to girls also in 1970. The school is known for its special teaching method, the Harkness method, where students discuss concepts instead of being lectured. The school has many important buildings, like the Class of 45 Library and the Exeter Inn. It has an art museum, called the Lamont Gallery.\nIts\u00a0rival school, Phillips Academy, was founded three years before in Andover,\u00a0Massachusetts by John Phillips' nephew, Samuel Phillips Jr. with the help of the older Phillips. Their football teams have played against each other almost every year since 1878. This makes their rivalry one of the oldest high school rivalries in the country.\nMany politicians, writers, and other leaders have graduated from this school. An American president, Franklin Pierce, went there, as did the children of three other American presidents: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Grover Cleveland. The inventor of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, also did. The school has three mottos: \"Non Sibi\", which means \"Not For Oneself\", \"Finis Origine Pendet\", which means \"The End Depends On The Beginning\", and \"\u03a7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6\", which means \"By the Grace of God\"."}

It is pulled along the bottom of the sea by a fishing boat to collect scallops, oysters and other kind of clams, crabs, and sea cucumber. Fishermen then lift the dredge into the boat and empty it.\nIn Europe, used to have \"teeth\" at the bottom, called tynes. These teeth raked or ploughed the sand and mud. This dug up buried clams. The New Bedford (USA) dredge does not have teeth.\nDredge nets have a gross mesh in order to let organisms smaller than the target organisms through. The net catches the larger organisms: in the case of scallop dredging that includes the scallops' predators, such as whelks, starfish and octopus.\nSometimes three or four dredges are attached to a wheeled stiff axle. A number of these dredges can be towed from a heavy spreading bar. Usually there is one on each side of the ship. The length of the bar and the number of dredges towed is dependent on the power of the ship and the room on the side of the boat for working the dredges. There could be 3 on each side on a small 10\u00a0metre boat. There could be up to 20 on each side for a 30-metre ship with 1500\u00a0hp. The weight and strength of this can dig up the ground. It overturns rocks and can crush animals and plants in its path.\nScallops often contain sand when fishermen use dredges. It can also damage the seabed if they use dredges carelessly. These days scallop dredging is sometimes replaced by scuba diving. However inventors are trying to invent a better dredge."}

He played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Wilmington Quicksteps, Baltimore Orioles, Brooklyn Bridegrooms, and New York Giants. Burns mostly played as an outfielder. He also played as a shortstop, second baseman, third baseman and pitcher. Over his career he compiled a batting average of .300 with 1,392 hits, 65 home runs, and 834 runs batted in (RBI) in 1,188 games played. Burns spent most of his career in the major leagues. He also played in minor league baseball. He first played in MLB at age 19. In his playing days, Burns was tall and weighed .\nBurns was nicknamed \"Oyster\" because he sold oysters in the off-season. He was described as a \"loudmouth\" with \"an irritating voice and personality\". Burns led the Bridegrooms to an American Association championship in 1889 and a National League pennant in 1890. He retired from baseball in 1901. He died on November 11, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York.\nEarly life.\nBurns was born on September 6, 1864, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Patrick and Mary Burns, both came to the United States from Ireland.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1883, Burns began his professional baseball career. He played as a pitcher for a minor league team in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In his first season, Burns had an earned run average (ERA) of 2.30, and pitched in 20 games. When he was not pitching, Burns played second and third base.\nBurns began the 1884 season playing for the Wilmington Quicksteps. He left the team on August 21, 1884, after they joined the Union Association. On the same day, Burns joined the Baltimore Orioles. At the age of 18, he was the youngest player on the Orioles. Burns played in only 35 games that season but had six home runs. He hit more home runs than any other player on the team that season. In 1885, he batted .231 with five home runs and 37 RBIs. Burns pitched to a 7\u20134 win\u2013loss record. His low batting average, however, led him to be demoted to the Newark Domestics for the 1886 season. Burns helped the Domestics win the Eastern League pennant. By 1887, he returned to playing in the majors for the Orioles. He became the Orioles' team captain. Burns lost the role when he threw a baseball at a pitcher on another team. He was later fined $25.\nOver the 1887 season, Burns hit nine home runs. He had 19 triples, which was tied with five other players for the American Association lead. He played in 140 games, which also tied for the league's lead.\nAfter playing in 79 games for Baltimore, Burns was moved to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms by Harry Von der Horst. Von der Horst owned both teams. While playing for the Bridegrooms, the \"New York Clipper\" described Burns as \"the noisiest man that ever played on the Brooklyn team. His voice reminds one of a buzz-saw.\" Burns remained with the Bridegrooms for the 1889 season. He had team highs in batting average and home runs. That season the Bridegrooms became American Association champions. In the World Series, the Bridegrooms played the New York Giants. Burns hit a three-run home run to win the fourth game of the series. This gave Brooklyn a 3\u20131 series lead. However, the Giants won the World Series after winning five straight games.\nIn 1890, the Bridegrooms moved to the National League. Burns, then 26, led the league in home runs (13) and RBIs (128). He hit for the cycle on August 1, 1890. He was the first Bridegroom to do so. The Bridegrooms won the National League pennant. In the 1890 World Series, the team played against the Louisville Colonels. The series ended in a 3\u20133\u20131 tie because of bad weather. In 1892, the Bridegrooms changed their name to the Grooms. Burns's RBI total was third highest in the league. His hits, doubles, triples, and batting average were the second highest on the Brooklyn team. In 1893, between games of a doubleheader, a teammate of Burns, Tom Daly, was sleeping in center field. Burns stabbed Daly with a knife. Daly woke up and turned into the knife. This led to a severed tendon which kept Daly out for two weeks. Burns' 1894 batting average (.355) was the highest of his career. He continued to play for the club until 1895, when he left the Grooms to play for the New York Giants. In his final MLB year, Burns batted .258 over 53 games.\nAfter the 1895 season, Burns' contract was bought by the minor league Newark Colts. The Colts won the Atlantic League division with a 82\u201361 record. The next season, Burns served as a player-coach for the Hartford Bluebirds. He lead the team in doubles and batting average. In his final year managing, Burns coached for a minor league team in Portland, Maine.\nAfter baseball.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Burns lived in Brooklyn. He died on November 11, 1928. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, New Jersey."}

Sucking is a natural instinct for babies and it soothes them.\nIt generally consists of a teat (which is the part designed to be sucked) made from either silicone (a type of plastic) or latex (a form of rubber). Silicone is becoming more popular as it is more durable and easier to keep clean. The teat is mounted on a plastic plate which can vary in shape from circular, oval or butterfly shape. It can come in a variety of different colors with different designs like cartoon characters to make it look more appealing to the baby. The main purpose of the plastic mouth guard is to stop the baby from accidentally swallowing the pacifier. If for some reason the child is able to swallow it, the mouth guard is made to be too large to pass through the throat and if it should get lodged in the throat it also has holes to allow air to pass through so the child can still breathe. Finally there is sometimes a ring attached to allow the parent to remove the pacifier.\nThere is some concern that the use of pacifiers can affect the child's teeth so many teats now are a special shape to allow the teeth to form properly, these are called orthodontic teats. Non-orthodontic teats are sometimes called cherry teats."}

Intergalactic dust is found between galaxies. Interstellar dust is found between stars. Dust clouds in these places are found by their blocking light from stars behind them, and by their own infrared radiation. Circumplanetary dust is found around planets and in planetary rings Interplanetary dust can be found between planets, and is seen as gegenschein and zodiacal light. \nThe coming together of large amounts of dust over time leads to the creation of planets, the Earth, for example."}

It uses a small amount of fat in a shallow pan. The heat must be quite high. Ingredients are often cut into pieces or sliced thinly. It makes things cook faster. \nFood that is saut\u00e9ed is browned, but it keeps the same texture, moisture and flavor. If meat, or fish is saut\u00e9ed, the saut\u00e9 is sometimes finished by using the pan's remains to make a sauce.\nSaut\u00e9ing is different from pan-frying. People sometimes confuse the two. In pan-frying larger pieces of food (for example, chops or steaks) are cooked quickly. Saut\u00e9ing is also different from searing. Searing only browns the surface of the food. Olive oil or clarified butter are commonly used for saut\u00e9ing. Most others fats will work too. Regular butter will produce more flavor. However it burns at a lower temperature and more quickly than other fats. This is because of the milk solids in it. Therefore clarified butter is better for saut\u00e9ing."}

It was originally published in Sweden on 26 November 1945. It is the first in a series of books about Pippi Longstocking. Pippi is a girl who lives alone in a house with her pets, a monkey named Mr. Nilsson and a horse that she keeps on the porch. She befriends Tommy and his sister Annika, who live next door to her.\nAs of 2009, the book has been translated into 64 languages.\nBackground.\nAstrid Lindgren first thought of Pippi Longstocking in 1941. Her 9-year-old daughter Karin was sick and had to be kept in bed. She asked her mother to tell her a story, so Lindgren made up a character named Pippi Longstocking and some stories about her to entertain her daughter. In 1944, she wrote them down and sent the manuscript of the book to Bonnier Publishers. They said that they did not want to publish the book. When the publishing company Rab\u00e9n and Sj\u00f6gren announced a children's book contest on January 28 of the next year, she sent a new version of the book to the company. It won first prize and was published in 1945. Afterwards, Rab\u00e9n and Sj\u00f6gren would also publish the sequels, \"Pippi Goes on Board\" (1946) and \"Pippi in the South Seas\" (1948). Since then, the series has been translated into many other languages. It has also been adapted into a television series and two movies.\nPlot.\nPippi is a girl who is 9 years old. She lives alone in Villa Villekulla, an old house in a garden way out at the end of a small town (the name of the town is not given). She lives there all alone because her father, a sea captain called Captain Efraim Longstocking, disappeared when he was washed overboard in a storm and her mother died when she was very young. Pippi believes that her mother is now an angel in Heaven, watching her through a peephole and her father, instead of drowning after being washed overboard, had actually floated to an island filled with cannibals and become a cannibal king.\nLuckily for her, her father had bought Villa Villekulla many years ago so that when he would grow old he would move into the house with his daughter. So Pippi decides to move into the house with the two things she had taken from her father's ship: her pet monkey named Mr. Nilsson (a present from her father) and a suitcase filled with gold coins. After moving into the house, she also buys a horse, which she keeps on the porch. She likes living alone because nobody orders her to go to bed and no one forces her to take cod liver oil, when she likes candy more.\nBeside the house, there is another house in which there live two well-behaved siblings named Annika and Tommy. They first meet Pippi when she is out on the road in the morning, walking backwards. They ask her about this and she answers that a person can walk any way she wants to in a free country. She continues to tell them that in Egypt, all the people walk backwards and nobody thinks it is strange. After they ask her whether she actually has been to Egypt, she answers that she has and that in Farthest India, the people have an even stranger way of walking: they walk on their hands. At this, they accuse her of lying and then she admits that she was lying and that in the Congo nobody speaks the truth.\nAfterwards, she invites them over to her house, where they eat pancakes and Pippi tells them about Brazilians, who always have eggs in their hair. Then she shows them some of the things which she and her father brought home from their journeys around the world. From these, Pippi gives them some gifts: Tommy gets a small knife with a handle of pearl and Annika gets a ring with a green stone. Annika and Tommy then go back to their home."}

It is one of the main sights in Vienna.\nHistory.\nOn December 20th, 1857, emperor Franz Joseph I. ordered to destroy the old city walls and to build a street which should show the glory of the Habsburg Empire. The old walls were a traffic block because in 1850, the suburbs became part of the city as districts II. till IX. The order of the emperor outlined the exact size of the boulevard, as well as the geographical positions and functions of the new buildings.

After Diaghilev's death she established what became The Royal Ballet. This became one of the foremost ballet companies of the 20th century and one of the leading ballet companies in the world today. She also established the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Royal Ballet School. She is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of ballet and as the 'godmother' of English ballet.\nCareer.\nBefore de Valois there had been no permanent ballet company in London, though there were a few quality dance schools which offered shows from time to time. The company which became the Royal Ballet started as the Vic-Wells Ballet, founded by de Valois in 1931. It had Anton Dolin as its Guest dancer. In 1933 the company was joined by Alicia Markova, who was appointed \"prima ballerina\". At this point de Valois retired as a stage performer, and continued as Director. Her reputation was now made as an organiser and teacher. She was also a choreographer, with a number of ballets to her credit. Her ballet \"Checkmate\" is still danced today.\n'Madame', as she was called by everyone, attracted great talents to the company. She engaged Frederick Ashton as Principal Choreographer and Constant Lambert as Musical Director, in 1935. Tamara Karsavina was a dance advisor. Eventually the company included many of the most famous ballet dancers in the world, including Margot Fonteyn, Svetlana Beriosova, and, most sensationally, Rudolf Nureyev.\nAs a manager, she had a fearsome reputation. She would stand for no misbehaviour, or for anything which stood in the way of the dance. One younger dancer said:\nThe Vic-Wells was given a Royal Charter in 1956, and became the Royal Ballet. Madame was its first Director. She retired from the Royal Ballet in 1963, but was a big influence for years. She was appointed a Companion of Honour, and awarded the Order of Merit. Madame died at the age of 102 in 2001."}

It was first published in 1962. The book won the 1963 Newbery Medal and the 1965 Sequoyah Book Award. It also won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1964.\nA live-action movie by Disney based on the book will be released in 2018.\nSummary.\n\"A Wrinkle in Time\"\u00a0is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure through time and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O'Keefe to rescue her father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on another planet. At the beginning of the book, Meg is a homely, awkward, but loving girl, troubled by personal insecurities and her concern for her father, who has been missing for over a year. The plot begins with the arrival of Mrs. Whatsit at the Murry house on a dark and stormy evening. Although she looks like an eccentric tramp, she is actually a celestial creature with the ability to read Meg's thoughts. she loves me so much the way, they meet Calvin O'Keefe, a popular boy in Meg's school whom Charles considers a kindred spirit. The three children learn from Mrs. Whatsit and her friends Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which that the universe is threatened by a great evil called the Dark Thing and taking the form of a giant cloud, engulfing the stars around it. Several planets have already succumbed to this evil force, including Camazotz, the planet on which Mr. Murry is imprisoned.\nThe three Mrs. W's transport the children to Camazotz and instruct them to remain always in each other's company while on their quest for Mr. Murry. On Camazotz, all objects and places appear exactly alike because the whole planet must conform to the terrifying rhythmic pulsation of IT, a giant disembodied brain. Charles Wallace tries to fight IT with his exceptional intelligence but is overpowered by the evil and becomes a robot-like creature mouthing the words with which IT infuses him. Under the control of IT, Charles leads Meg and Calvin to Mr. Murry and together they confront IT. However, they, too, are unable to withstand IT's power; they escape only at the last minute, when Mr. Murry appears and seizes Meg and Calvin, \"tessering\" away with them (traveling via another tesseract) to a gray planet called Ixchel inhabited by tall, furry beasts who care for the travelers. Charles Wallace remains possessed by IT, a prisoner of Camazotz.\nOn Planet Ixchel the three Mrs. W's appear once again, and Meg realizes that she must travel alone back to Camazotz to rescue her brother. Mrs. Which tells her that she has one thing that IT does not have, and this will be her weapon against the evil. However, Meg must discover this weapon for herself. When standing in the presence of IT, Meg realizes what this is: her ability to love. Thus, by concentrating on her love for Charles Wallace, she is able to restore him to his true identity. Meg releases Charles from IT's clutches and tessers with him through time and space, landing in her twin brothers' vegetable garden on Earth, where her father and Calvin stand waiting. The family joyously reunites, and the Mrs. W's visit the happy scene en route to further travels.\nMain Characters.\nMeg Murry\u00a0-\u00a0 The book's heroine and protagonist, a homely, awkward, but loving high school student who is sent on an adventure through time and space with her brother and her friend Calvin to rescue her father from the evil force that is attempting to take over the universe.

It was found in a picture taken by the Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory, in California. When it was discovered, it was orbiting Jupiter. It was the first comet seen to be orbiting a planet. Scientists think that it had been orbiting the planet for 20 - 30 years before its discovery. \nCrash.\nCalculations showed that its unusual broken up form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker-Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's Roche limit. Jupiter's tidal forces had acted to pull the comet apart. The comet was later observed as a series of pieces up to in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July\u00a016 and July 22, 1994. The pieces were moving at a speed of approximately 60 km/s. The impact scars were more easily seen than the Great Red Spot and they stayed for many months."}

Some cultures, like the ancient Egyptians, thought this was a different operation than division. Some mathematicians up until the 16th century (1500-1599) thought this too. Today division by two is handled specially in modern computer programming.\nDivision by two is also called halving, mediation, and dimidiation.\nBinary.\nIn a binary number system, there are only two digits: 0 and 1. All other numbers are represented with those two digits. For example, \"one\" is 1, \"two\" is 10, \"three\" is 11, \"four\" is 100, and so on. Most of the time people use a number system with ten digits (the numbers 0 through 9.) This is called the decimal number system.\nDivision by two in binary is very easy. It is done by dropping the last digit on the right of the number. This is called a \"bit shift operation.\" For example, if we performed a bit shift operation on the binary number 100, we'd get 10. Since binary 100 is decimal 4, and binary 10 is decimal 2, this makes sense.\nAnother example is performing a bit shift operation on 1101. This would leave us with 110, but we dropped a 1 from the end, not a zero. This also makes sense because 1101 in binary is 13 in decimal. If we divide 13 by 2, we get 6 with a remainder of 1 (we have 1 left over.)\nComputers.\nComputers use the binary number system to store information. Information is broken up into tiny pieces called \"bits\". Each bit is either a 0 or a 1. Because of this, the fastest and easiest way for a computer to do division is by a bit shift operations -- division by two. Replacing regular division with bit shifts is a way to do program optimization. (Program optimization is trying to make a program faster and more efficient.)\nIn computer programming, the symbol codice_1 is sometimes used to show a bit shift operation. In Java, we can ask the computer to do the problem formula_1 by writing codice_2. This is the same as writing codice_3. Both of these versions will give us the answer codice_4. There is a problem when trying to do something a problem like formula_2. In Java, if we write codice_5, the computer will tell us the answer is codice_6. But if we try to do codice_7, the computer will say the answer is codice_8. This will happen every time we try to do a bit shift operation with one negative number. The reason for this is complicated, and has to do with the way negative binary numbers are saved by the computer.\nEven though it is fastest for computers to do division using bit shift operations, most computer code does not do it this way. This is because programmers want their programs to be \"portable\" and \"readable\". Portable means that a program can be run on many different kinds of computers and operating systems. Readable means that the source code is easy to read and understand. Most of the time, the compiler (a program that changes source code into 0's and 1's that the computer can understand) will change the division into bit shifts automatically."}

That is why the textbooks call it \"phase-sensitive learning\". It is learning which happens at a particular age or a particular life stage. The animal fixes on a particular signal (sound or sight), which is said to be 'imprinted' onto the subject. The process of imprinting is caused by an inherited instinct.\nThe best-known form of imprinting is the imprinting of the newly-hatched (or born) on one or both parent. Its function is to keep the young near their parent(s) during the early learning period. It is most obvious in birds, such as ducks and geese, after the fledglings have left the nest. They imprint on their parents and then follow them around, often in a long line, on land and on water.\nIt was first reported in domestic chickens, by the 19th-century amateur biologist Douglas Spalding. It was rediscovered by the early ethologist Oskar Heinroth, and studied extensively and popularised by his disciple Konrad Lorenz, and by Niko Tinbergen.\nLorenz showed how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what a 'critical period' of 13\u201316 hours after hatching. For example, the goslings would imprint on Lorenz himself (to be more specific, on his wading boots). He is often shown in photographs being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him.\nIn child development, the term is used to refer to the process by which a baby learns who its mother and father are. The process is recognised as beginning in the womb, when the unborn baby starts to recognise its parents' voices.\nThe filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie \"Winged Migration (Le Peuple Migrateur)\", which contains footage of migratory birds in flight. The birds imprinted on handlers, who wore yellow jackets and honked horns constantly. The birds were then trained to fly along with a variety of aircraft, usually ultralights."}

He started Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1957 with Harlan Anderson.\nBackground.\nOlsen was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He grew up in nearby Stratford, Connecticut. His father's parents came from Norway and his mother's parents came from Sweden. Olsen began his career working summers in a machine shop. Olsen fixed radios in his basement as a child.\nHe served in the United States Navy between 1944 and 1946. Then Olsen studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He earned a Bachelor of Science in 1950 and a Master of Science degree in 1952. Both degrees were in electrical engineering.\nCareer.\nWhile he was studying at MIT, the Office of Naval Research of the United States Department of the Navy asked Olsen to help build a computerized flight simulator. Also while at MIT, Olsen directed a project to make the first transistorized research computer. Olsen also worked as an engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory on the TX-2 project.\nIn 1957, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson, decided to start their own company. Harlan was also at MIT. They asked American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC) for money. ARDC was an early venture capital company started by Georges Doriot. In the 1960s, Olsen received patents for a saturable switch, a diode transformer gate circuit, an improved version of magnetic core memory, and the line printer buffer. Their company's headquarters was in an old wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts. In 1992, the company had their best sales of $14,000,000,000. DEC was sold to Compaq for $9,600,000,000 in 1999. It later became a part of Hewlett-Packard.\nKen Olsen was known throughout his career for his fatherly management style and for supporting new ideas in engineering. He thought new ideas and technical excellence were very important. He used engineering matrix management. This management approach is used throughout many industries today.\nHe was awarded the Vermilye Medal in 1980.\nIn 1986, \"Fortune Magazine\" named Olsen \"America's most successful entrepreneur\", and the same year he received the IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award.\nLater career history.\nIn 1987 he gave the first of his \"snake oil speeches\". Some people thought he was talking about the \"Unix Conspiracy\". Olsen believed VMS was a better operating system for DEC customers than UNIX. He said why VMS was good. Yet, he did approve and encourage a plan inside DEC to make a UNIX for VAX computers based on BSD. This version of UNIX was called Ultrix. However, Ultrix never got good support from within DEC.\nOlsen retired from DEC in 1992. He then became the chairman of Advanced Modular Solutions. Olsen was also a major contributor to The Family, a religious and political organization. Olsen also was a trustee of Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts. The college named a science center after him.\nDeath.\nOlsen died while in hospice care in Indianapolis, Indiana on February 6, 2011, aged 84. The cause of death was not announced.

She was the Chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, the leader the Democratic Party from 2011 until she resigned in 2016. From 1993 to 2004, she served in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate.\nHer district covers parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Her district includes the cities of Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach.\nEarly life, education and career.\nShe was born Deborah Wasserman in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. She grew up on Long Island. She received a Bachelor of Arts in 1988 and a Master of Arts with certificate in political campaigning in 1990, both in Political Science, from the University of Florida, in Gainesville.\nAt the University of Florida, Schultz was in student government. She was President of the Student Senate as well as founder and President of the Rawlings Area Council Government. She was also a member of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society, the James C. Grimm chapter of the National Residence Hall Honorary, and the union Graduate Assistants United. She served as President of the Graduate Student Council. She said that student politics developed her \"love for politics and the political process.\"\nFlorida House of Representatives.\nIn 1988 Schultz became an aide to Peter Deutsch at the beginning of his state legislative career. In 1992, Deutsch won election to the United States House of Representatives, which made his Florida post vancant. Schultz recalled getting a call from Deutsch at the time: \"It was really amazing. He called me at home one day in the middle of the legislative session and he said, 'You could run in my race, your house is in my district.'\" She had lived in the district for only three years. Schultz then won 53 percent of the vote in a six-way Democratic primary and avoided a runoff. She went on to win the general election and succeeded Deutsch in Florida's House of Representatives. At the age of 26, she became the youngest female legislator in Florida's history.\nShe served in the Florida State House of Representatives for eight years. State term limits required Schultz to leave the House. In addition to her work as a state legislator, she became an adjunct instructor of political science at Broward Community College. She also worked as a public policy curriculum specialist at Nova Southeastern University. She was elected to the Florida State Senate in 2000. She was considered one of the most liberal members of Florida's state legislature. She supported legislation requiring gender price parity for dry cleaning. She supported bills to require that an equal number of men and women were appointed to state boards. She pushed through several bills including the Florida Residential Swimming Pool Safety Act and one creating a Children's Services Council for Broward County. The Save The Manatee Club gave Schultz an award for her work in the state senate to protect manatees.\nU.S. House of Representatives.\nCommittee assignments.\nShe serves on the following committees:\nParty leadership.\nShe is Chief Deputy Whip for the House Democrats. Schultz is a member of the New Democrat Coalition.\nSchultz was appointed to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in her first term in Congress. During the 2006 elections, she raised over seventeen million dollars in campaign contributions for her Democratic colleagues. The only two congressmen to raise more money that year were Nancy Pelosi and Rahm Emanuel. Democrats in the House of Representatives chose her to be Chief Deputy Whip. They appointed her to the Appropriations Committee. (This was a very good job for a congresswoman with only two years of experience.)\nShe is a member of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's \"30 Something\" Working Group, which consists of congressional Democrats under age 40. The group concentrates on issues affecting young people, including Social Security. She also has joined the bipartisan Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus. According to the \"Congress.org\" 2008 Power Rankings, she was the 24th most powerful member of the House and 22nd most powerful Democratic representative (also most powerful Florida representative).\nChair of the Democratic National Committee.\nIn April 2011, Tim Kaine resigned as Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman in order to run for the United States Senate. On April 5, 2011, President Barack Obama chose Schultz to succeed Kaine as the 52nd Chairman of the DNC. Between Kaine's resignation and the next DNC meeting, current DNC Vice-Chair Donna Brazile served as the interim Chair of the Democratic National Committee. On May 4, 2011, the DNC met and elected Schultz as its chair. Schultz became the third female DNC chief in history and the first in over 15 years.\nWikileaks scandal and resignation.\nOn July 24, 2016, it was announced that she would resign her position as chairperson of the Democratic National Committee following the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Leaked emails provided by WikiLeaks showed Schultz and other members of the DNC staff mocking and attempting to sabotage the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders in favor of Clinton's campaign.\nThe Clinton campaign announced the same day that Wasserman Schultz would act as honorary chair of an effort to elect Democrats across the United States in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\nPersonal life.\nSchultz currently lives in Weston outside Fort Lauderdale. She has three children and is married to Steve Schultz. She is an active member of the National Jewish Democratic Council, Planned Parenthood and Hadassah.\nIn March 2009, she said that she went through seven surgeries related to breast cancer in 2008, while remaining a member of the House. That year, she promoted efforts for early screening for breast cancer."}

The island was originally connected to the mainland, but it eventually became separated with the Indian Ocean, and so it became an island. As Aboriginal people did not have boats, the island had no one living on it until the Europeans arrived. Dutch sailor Willem de Vlamingh named the island \"Rattenest\", meaning \"Rat's nest\". The 'rats' he was referring to was actually a Quokka, a native animal on the island. \nAfter the Swan River Colony was established in 1830, Robert Thomson settled on the island with his family. He made a living selling salt, which is naturally found on the island. Before refrigeration, salt was very important, as it kept food fresh.\nThe island became a prison for Aboriginals, during the periods of 1838-1849 and 1855-1931. Around 3,700 Aboriginal men and boys were imprisoned for crimes such as spearing livestock, burning the bush and digging vegetables.\nRottnest Island was also used during World War I and II. \nAnimals.\nRottnest is home to the Quokka, and is one of the few places in the world where they live.\nTourism.\nRottnest Island is now a very popular tourist destination, due to its beaches, wildlife and natural environment.

It is responsible for the management of international ice hockey tournaments, and maintains the IIHF World Ranking.\nDespite its worldwide authority, the IIHF has little control of hockey in North America, where the National Hockey League (NHL) is the highest hockey organization. Its base of power rests in Europe with the respective national governing bodies and leagues. Canada (Hockey Canada) and the United States (USA Hockey) are the only members who have their own rulebooks.\nDecisions of the IIHF can be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nThe IIHF museum was located within the International Hockey Hall of Fame Museum located in Kingston, Ontario from 1992 to 1997. After terminating the partnership with the International Hockey Hall of Fame, the IIHF signed an agreement with the NHL to house their museum within the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, the IIHF museum relocated to Toronto, Ontario, occupying over within the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nAs part of the centennial celebrations of the IIHF's founding, the 2008 IIHF World Championship was held in Canada, the perennial leaders of the sport. This was the first time the championships were hosted in Canada. Russia went on to win the 2008 Championship.\nFunctions.\nThe main functions of the IIHF are to govern, develop and organize hockey throughout the world. Also to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the sport.\nThe federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its statutes, bylaws and regulations as well as in holding a clear jurisdiction in what concerns to ice hockey and in-line hockey at the international level. The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the sponsorships, license rights, advertising and merchandising in connection with all IIHF competitions.\nAnother purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players' development and in the development of coaches and game officials. On the other hand, all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups. The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players' transfers. It is also the body that presides over ice hockey in the Olympic Games as well as over all levels of the IIHF World Championships. The federation works in collaboration with local committees when organizing its 25 World Championships, at five different categories.\nEven though the IIHF runs the world championships, it is also responsible for the organization of several European club competitions such as the Champions Hockey League or the Continental Cup. With its 100 anniversary, the federation launched a new annual club competition in 2008, the Victoria Cup, named after the Montreal Victoria Skating Rink, the site of the first organized indoor ice hockey match.\nThe federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body, which is the Council. The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard of the game's rules, the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation. It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board.\nThe president of the IIHF is basically the representative of the federation. He represents the federation's interests I all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federation's statues and regulations. The president is assisted by the General Secretary who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF.\nHistory.\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on May 15, 1908 at 34 Rue de Provence in Paris, France, as Ligue International de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The founders of the federation were representatives from Belgium, France, Great Britain, Switzerland and Bohemia (now Czech republic). Louis Magnus, the French representative, was the fifth member to sign the founding document and also the first president of the LIGH. A year later, the first congress was held in Paris and then another one during the same year in Chamonix, France.\nMembers.\nThe Federation has 51 full members: Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, DPR Korea, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and United States. Full members have a national body dedicated to the sport, and participate annually in the international championships. Only full members have voting rights.\nIn addition, there are 16 associate members and 3 affiliate members.\nAssociate members either do not have a national body dedicated to the sport, or do not regularly participate in the international championships. They are Andorra, Armenia, Brazil, Georgia, Greece, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Macau, Macedonia, Malaysia, Moldova, Morocco, Portugal, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.\nAffiliate members participate only in the inline championships.

Physical transformations are when a state of matter (a solid or liquid, for example) changes to another state. Examples of transformations include melting (when a solid becomes a liquid) and boiling (when a liquid becomes a gas).\nA reaction gives out or takes in energy. A physical transformation also gives out or takes in energy. Thermochemistry looks at these energy changes, particularly on a system's energy exchange with its surroundings. Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities at all times during a given reaction. Thermochemists do this by using data, including entropy determinations. Thermochemists will tell if a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favorable or unfavorable. \nEndothermic reactions take in heat. Exothermic reactions give out heat. Thermochemistry combines the concepts of thermodynamics with the idea of energy in the form of chemical bonds. It includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of formation, enthalpy, entropy, free energy, and calories.\nHistory.\nThermochemistry started with two ideas:\nThese discoveries came before the first law of thermodynamics (1845). They helped scientists understand this law.\nEdward Diaz and Hess investigated specific heat and latent heat.

For other uses of the term \"arrow,\" see Arrow.\"\nArrows Grand Prix International was a Formula One team active from 1978 to 2002. The team was also known as Footwork.\nOrigins.\nThe Arrows Grand Prix International team was founded in 1977, by Italian financier (someone who handles lots of money) Franco Ambrosio, Alan Rees, Jackie Oliver, Dave Wass and Tony Southgate when Rees, Oliver, Wass and Southgate left the Shadow team. They named the team after the first letter of each person's last name in order, spelling out AROWS. The name was then changed to the correct spelling of Arrows.\nHistory.\nArrows Grand Prix International.\nThe team earned their first podium at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, with future Williams driver Riccardo Patrese earning second. The rest of the season consisted of him earning points occasionally. Arrows fielded Patrese until 1981. In 1984 the team used BMW M12 turbo engines, and later Megatron turbos, and results improved as the turbo era moved along, going at its peak in 1988 when the team finished fifth in the constructors' championship. In between 1984 and 1988 the team had gotten two podium positions. Eventually when turbo engines were banned from the regulations, making them illegal to run in a race, Arrows' performance dropped, despite a third place podium finish at the 1989 USA Grand Prix in Phoenix.\nFootwork Arrows.\nThe team was renamed Footwork in 1991 until being changed back to Arrows after the 1996 season. Arrows' performance dropped with the usage of the Porsche engines. Footwork eventually changed to Mugen Honda engines. The team also ran Ford and Hart engines as well.\nTom Walkenshaw's Arrows.\nIn 1997, Tom Walkenshaw bought a part of Arrows, and hired 1996 Drivers' Champion Damon Hill and Pedro Diniz. Diniz was very rich and helped pay for Hill's salary, placing Diniz as the role of a pay driver. Hill nearly won the Hungarian Grand Prix but a component failure meant that Hill had slowed down and fell to second place, where Hill would finish.

She started as a child model and actress who has appeared in more than 20 movies and television series and more than 60 commercials. She is best known for her role as the young dancer CeCe Jones on the Disney Channel series \"Shake It Up!\".\nEarly life.\nBella Thorne was born on October 8, 1997 in Pembroke Pines, Florida. She is the youngest of four children. Her older siblings are Kaili (born in 1992), Dani (born in 1993), and Remy (born in 1995), who are also actors and models. When Thorne was growing up, Spanish was her first language, but she has forgotten it from not using it.\nCareer.\nThorne's first movie appearance was as a sidelines fan in the 2003 movie \"Stuck on You\", but she was not credited for it. Since then, she has appeared in movie and television projects including \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"Entourage\", \"The O.C.\" (as a younger version of Taylor Townsend), the third-to-last episode of \"October Road\", and five episodes of \"Dirty Sexy Money\" (as Margaux Darling). In 2007, Thorne appeared as a young girl who saw visions in \"The Seer\".\nIn 2008, Thorne starred alongside Christian Slater and Taylor Lautner in the drama series \"My Own Worst Enemy\". She won a Young Artist's Award for her portrayal of the character Ruthy Spivey in this series. She then appeared in the ten-episode web series \"Little Monk\", which showed characters from the series \"Monk\" as children. In 2009, she played the antagonist in the horror movie \"Forget Me Not\".\nIn 2010, Thorne joined the cast of HBO's \"Big Love\" in its fourth season. She replaced Jolean Wejbe in the role of Bill Henrickson's daughter Tancy 'Teeny' Henrickson, even though she had actually auditioned for a different role. She also guest starred on \"Wizards of Waverly Place\", as Max's girlfriend Nancy Lukey. Thorne also took on a supporting role in the family drama \"Raspberry Magic\".\nThorne was also a child model. Since appearing in her first picture for a parenting magazine at the age of 6 weeks, Thorne has starred in television ad campaigns for Digital Light Processing, Publix, and KFC, and appeared in print ads for brands including Barbie, ALDO K!DS, JLO by Jennifer Lopez, Kaiya Eve Couture, LaSenza Girl, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Guess?, Target, Justice and Mudd for Kohls. She also modelled for Sears Back to School. In an interview with Seventeen magazine, Thorne said that her appointment as the spokesperson for Texas Instruments was her big break. She also said that she has lost much more projects than she has booked and said that the support of her family helped her get over disappointments.\nThorne currently co-stars on the Disney Channel sitcom \"Shake It Up!\", (originally titled \"Dance, Dance Chicago\"). Thorne plays Cecelia \"CeCe\" Jones, a dancer who dreams of a career in the spotlight. While she had done a lot of work in television and movie, Thorne had no experience in professional dancing before being cast in this show. After signing onto the show in October 2009, she began taking three dance classes every night.\nPersonal life.\nThorne is from Pembroke Pines, Florida, but has been living with her family in California since early 2006. Her interests include dancing, playing soccer, spending time with her family and playing with her two dogs, six cats and a turtle. She also says that she collects hardcover books, listens to 80s music, and uses YouTube as a research tool for getting into character. Thorne is a strong supporter of the Humane Society, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and The Nomad Organization, which provides education, food and medical supplies to children in Africa.\nThorne lost her father to a vehicle accident in 2007.\nThorne was diagnosed with dyslexia in second grade. She is currently being home-schooled. She used to go to a public school, but was abused by other students. Thorne improved in her learning after attending a Sylvan Learning center and is currently reading and writing a grade ahead. Thorne also talked about her dyslexia in an April 2010 interview with American Cheerleader Magazine, and explained that she overcame her dyslexia by reading everything she could find, including the labels of cereal boxes.\nThorne is currently dating YouTuber Sam Pepper. In August 2016, Thorne came out as bisexual."}

It is the youngest of the nine states and came to Austria after the First World War in 1921. The name Vierburgenland (Land of Four Castles) was created in 1919. It was derived from the name of the four v\u00e1rmegye of the Kingdom of Hungary (in German Komitate, 'counties') known in Hungarian as Pozsony, Moson, Sopron and Vas, or in German as Pressburg, Wieselburg, \u00d6denburg and Eisenburg. Because Pressburg was given to Czechoslovakia, the number was dropped. In 1922 the name was adopted by the province assembly.\nGeography.\nBurgenland has an area of 3961.80\u00a0km\u00b2. It is divided into 3 regions (districts):\nSometimes Mittelburgenland is seen as a part of southern Burgenland.\nThe highest point of the state is the Geschriebenstein at 884 m, the lowest point is near Apetlon at 114 m. Burgenland and Hungary share the Neusiedler See. Leitha, Pulka and Raab are important rivers.\nMinorities.\nBurgenland has Croatian (29,000 - 45,000) and Hungarian (5,000 - 15,000) populations. The Burgenland Croatian language is an 16th-century dialect which is different from standard Croatian. In former times there was also a Roma and Jewish population, but the Nazis destroyed them.\nHistory.\nIn 1043 a peace treaty between Henry III and King Samuel Aba of Hungary fixed the western border of the Kingdom of Hungary along the Leitha and Lafnitz rivers, among others. The territory of the present-day Burgenland became the western border-zone of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century. The majority of the population was Germanic. There was also immigration in the Middle Ages from the neighbouring Austria. During occupation of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire some parts of today's Burgenland stayed within Habsburg rule. After the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed in 1867 Burgenland was part of the Hungarian part of the monarchy. Because 74% of the inhabitants were of German origin the area came to the new formed Republic of Austria. In the time till the Second World War many people emigrated to the United States. It is said that Chicago is the largest town of the Burgenland.\nDuring the Nazi occupation the state was part of Styria and Lower Danube. In addition to the oppression of the Jews, the ethnic groups Roma and Sinti also suffered under the Nazi regime. The Lackenbach concentration camp for Gypsies was in the area.\nAfter the Second World War Burgenland was part of the Soviet occupation zone. After the Staatsvertrag it had a long border to the communist area in eastern Europe. The economic development was very slow. After joining the European Union this development became faster.\nPolitics.\nBurgenland's provincial assembly (Landtag) has 36 seats. The provincial government is a combination of Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) and the Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP). The voting age for regional elections in Burgenland was reduced to 16 in 2003.\nCulture and tourism.\nThe area's main attractions are the Neusiedler See (the lake), the hot springs at Lutzmannsburg, Stegersbach and Bad Tatzmannsdorf. There is also over 500\u00a0km of bicycle tracks in Also.\nThere are several events in summer:"}

It combines aspects of inorganic chemistry (the study of non-carbon bonds) and organic chemistry (the study of carbon bonds).\nExamples of organometallic compounds are tetraethyllead; it was used as a fuel (leaded gasoline) additive in the past. Also Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) is a common organometallic compound.\nOrganometallic compounds.\nOrganometallic compounds are compounds that have chemical bonds between an one or more metal atoms and one or more carbon atoms of an organyl group (an organic ligand). They have the prefix \"organo-\" (for example, organopalladium compounds). Organometallic compounds include subgroups like the metalloproteins such as haemoglobin. \nThe term \"metalorganics\" usually refers to metal-containing compounds lacking direct metal-carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands which bind them to an organic compound. Metal beta-diketonates, alkoxides, and dialkylamides are members of this class.\nIn addition to the traditional metals, elements such as boron, silicon, arsenic, and selenium form organometallic compounds.\nCoordination compounds with organic ligands.\nMany complexes have coordination bonds between a metal and organic ligands. The organic ligands often bind the metal through a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen, in which case such compounds are called \"coordination compounds\". \nMany organic coordination compounds occur in nature. For example, hemoglobin and myoglobin contain an iron center coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of a porphyrin ring; magnesium is the center of a chlorin ring in chlorophyll. The field of such inorganic compounds is known as bioinorganic chemistry. However, methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12), with a cobalt-methyl bond, is a true organometallic complex, one of the few known in biology. \nStructure and properties.\nThe metal-carbon bond in organometallic compounds is half way between being ionic and covalent. Organometallic compounds with bonds that have characters in between ionic and covalent are very important in industry. They are both relatively stable in solutions but ionic enough to undergo reactions. Two important classes are organolithium and Grignard reagents. \nUses.\nOrganometallics find practical uses in stoichiometric and catalytic processes, especially processes involving carbon monoxide and alkene-derived polymers. All the world's polyethylene and polypropylene are produced with organometallic catalysts. Acetic acid is produced using metal carbonyl catalysts in the Monsanto process and Cativa process. The bulk of the synthetic alcohols, at least those larger than ethanol, are produced by hydrogenation of hydroformylation-derived aldehydes. Similarly, the Wacker process is used in the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde.\nOrganomettalic are highly basic and highly reducing. They catalyze many polymerization reactions. They are also useful stoichiometrically.\nOrganometallic compounds may be found in the environment. Environmentalists worry about organo-lead and organo-mercury compounds. They are toxic hazards.\nResearch is currently underway using organometallic catalysis. The energy crisis has initiated increased interest in more efficient ways of working with the remaining fossil fuels we have left. While many agree that lowering oil dependence is safer for the environment as well as politically wise. The new interest in \u201cgreen\u201d technologies has also helped increase research. Many examples of organometallic research can be found in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Some current methods of chemical production are wasteful and produce toxic waste, while many organometallic catalysts show promise to change that.\nHistory.\nLouis Claude Cadet synthesized methyl arsenic compounds related to cacodyl. William Christopher Zeise made platinum-ethylene complex. Edward Frankland discovered dimethyl zinc. Ludwig Mond discovered Ni(CO)4. Victor Grignard worked with organomagnesium compounds. The abundant and diverse products from coal and petroleum led to Ziegler-Natta, Fischer-Tropsch, hydroformylation catalysis which employ CO, H2, and alkenes as feedstocks and ligands.\nYears ago, Tetraethyllead was added to gasoline as an antiknock agent. Because lead is toxic, it is no longer used in gasoline. Instead, other organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) are now added to gasoline to prevent knocking.\nThe 1973 Nobel Prizes to Ernst Fischer and Geoffrey Wilkinson for work on metallocenes made organometallic chemistry more popular. In 2005, Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock shared the Nobel Prize for metal-catalyzed olefin metathesis."}

It is the third largest lake in the Lake District. It is long and wide. The lake has an elevation of 143 feet (44 m) above sea level. It drains to the sea via the River Crake.\nWaterspeed record.\nIn the 20th century Coniston was the scene of many attempts to break the world water speed record. On August 19, 1939 Sir Malcolm Campbell set the record at 141.74 miles per hour (228.108\u00a0km/h) in Bluebird K4. Between 1956 and 1959 Sir Malcolm's son Donald Campbell set four successive records on the lake in Bluebird K7, a hydroplane.\nIn 1966 Donald Campbell decided that he needed to get over 300 miles per hour (483\u00a0km/h) to keep the record. On January 4, 1967 he achieved a top speed of over 320 miles per hour (515\u00a0km/h) in Bluebird K7 on the return leg of a record-breaking attempt. He then lost control of Bluebird, which somersaulted and crashed, sinking rapidly. Campbell was killed instantly on impact. The attempt could not be counted as a record-breaking run because the second leg was not completed.\nLady in the Lake.\nIn recent times, Coniston Water has become known for a controversial murder case. Mrs Carol Park was dubbed the \"Lady in the Lake\" after the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name."}

It is the first known pterosaur to display features of both long-tailed (rhamphorhynchoid) and short-tailed (pterodactyloid) pterosaurs. \"Darwinopterus\" is a transitional fossil between the two groups. \nBetween 30 and 40 fossil specimens have been found, all collected from the Tiaojishan Formation, which dates to the Middle Jurassic, 160 million years ago (mya). The type species, \"D. modularis\", was described in February 2010. \nTwo additional species, \"D. linglongtaensis\" and \"D. robustodens\", were described from the same fossil beds in December 2010 and June 2011, respectively.\nThe specimens showed sexual dimorphism: the males had crests on their heads, and narrower hips than the females.\nMosaic features.\nThis genus, and its near relatives, show a combination of 'primitive' (basal) and 'advanced' (derived) pterosaurian features. This is characteristic of transitional fossils ('missing links'), and is called modular evolution or mosaic evolution.\n\"Darwinopterus\" had long tails and other features of rhamphorhynchoids, they also had distinct pterodactyloid features, such as long vertebrae in the neck and a single skull opening in front of the eyes.\nEggs.\nThe specimen preserved along with an egg gave information on the reproductive strategies of \"Darwinopterus\" and pterosaurs in general. \nLike the eggs of later pterosaurs and modern reptiles, the eggs of \"Darwinopterus\" had a parchment-like, soft shell. In modern birds, the eggshell is hardened with calcium carbonate, completely shielding the embryo from the outside environment. Soft-shelled eggs are permeable to water, and allow significant amounts to be absorbed into the egg during development. Eggs of this type are more vulnerable to the elements and are typically buried in soil. \nDavid Unwin, a co-author of the paper, suggested that \"Darwinopterus\" probably laid many small eggs at a time and buried them. Juveniles could fly upon hatching, and required little to no parental care. \nThese results imply that reproduction in pterosaurs was more like that in modern reptiles and significantly differed from reproduction in birds."}

It may be a rare fossil, such as \"Archaeopteryx\", which shows early features of a group which later becomes widespread.\nThe rarity of transitional forms is interesting. It suggests the new forms are not yet dominant in the ecology of their time, and their populations are relatively small. It follows that their fossils would be scarce. In the Solnhofen limestone where \"Archaeopteryx\" was found, there are more examples of pterosaurs of several genera than there are of the proto-bird. In the Jurassic, the pterosaurs were dominant in the air.\nBut in the Lower Cretaceous the situation is reversed. The pterosaurs are in decline, and large numbers of different bird species are found in the famous Chinese lagerstatten deposits such as the Jehol biota. The Lower Cretaceous birds are clearly more bird-like, and the features they developed enabled them to invade habitat niches which had been the preserve of pterosaurs, or maybe were not previously exploited at all.\nMosaic evolution.\nTypical of transitional fossils is that some features are clearly basal or primitive. Other features are advanced ('derived'). With \"Archaeopteryx\", the front legs are derived, and show clearly the capacity for flight. Also, the feathers had the rachus (stem) off-centre, a feature of all bird flight feathers. The rest of the skeleton was just like any other small carnivorous dinosaur.p35\nWhen transition takes place between one group and another, not all features change at the same time. This is called mosaic evolution.408 Transitions between higher groups would involve a series of transitional species, only a few of which may be found as fossils."}

{"id": "305685", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305685", "title": "Period 1 element", "text": "A period 1 element is an element in the first period (row) of the periodic table. The periodic table is arranged in rows to show repeating properties of the elements. When the atomic number increases, the element have different properties. A new row begins when chemical properties repeat. It means that elements in the same group have similar properties. The first period has less elements than any other periods in the periodic table. There are only two elements in the first period: hydrogen and helium. We can explain why \"there is less elements in the first row\" in modern theories of atomic structure. This is because in quantum physics, this period fills up the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements follows the duet rule, they only need two electrons to complete their valence shell. These elements can only hold two electrons, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.\nPeriodic trends.\nAs period 1 only has two elements, there are no remarkable periodic trends.\nPosition of period 1 elements in the periodic table.\nAlthough both hydrogen and helium are in the s-block, they do not behaves similarly to other s-block elements. There is argument over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table.\nHydrogen.\nThe position of hydrogen is sometimes above lithium, sometimes above carbon, sometimes above fluorine, sometimes above both lithium and fluorine (appearing two times), or float above the other elements and not belongs to any group in the periodic table.\nHelium.\nThe position of helium is almost always above neon (which is in the p-block) in the periodic table because it is a noble gas. However, sometimes the position of it is above beryllium because they have similar electron configuration.\nElements in period 1.\nHydrogen.\nHydrogen (symbol:H) is a chemical element. Its atomic number is 1. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen has no color, no smell and no taste. It belongs to nonmetal, and it is highly flammable. It is a diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Its atomic mass is 1.00794\u00a0amu, making hydrogen the lightest element.\nHydrogen is the most abundant of the chemical elements. The abundance of hydrogen is roughly 75%. Stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. However, there are less hydrogen on Earth. Therefore, hydrogen is industrially produced from hydrocarbons (e.g. methane). We use elemental hydrogen locally at the production site. The largest markets almost equally divided between fossil fuel upgrading, such as hydrocracking, and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen may be produced from water using the process of electrolysis, but this process is significantly more expensive commercially than hydrogen production from natural gas.\nThe most common naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, has a single proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, it can take on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a negative charge, becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\nThe interactions of hydrogen with various metals are very important in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it for use as a fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.\nHelium.\nHelium (He) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert monatomic chemical element that heads the noble gas series in the periodic table and whose atomic number is 2. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.\nHelium was discovered in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in the natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.\nHelium is the second lightest element and is the second most abundant in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created as a result of the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation."}

The focus was northwest of Richmond and from the town of Mineral, Virginia. The earthquake was along the Spotsylvania Fault, an ancient fault line that now sits in the middle of the North American plate. Four aftershocks happened within twelve hours of the main earthquake. The aftershocks had magnitudes 2.8, 2.2, 4.2 and 3.4. About 35 hours after the main earthquake, a sixth aftershock of magnitude 4.5 occurred. As of August 30, there have been 19 aftershocks, most of them minor.\nThere are very few strong earthquakes east of the Rockies in the U.S. This was only the second magnitude 5.8 in the last last 114 years. The other was the 1944 quake on the New York-Ontario border.\nImpact.\nPress reports show that the earthquake could be felt a long distance away from its center. To the south, the earthquake reached Atlanta, Georgia; and to the north, the earthquake reached Quebec City, Quebec. To the west, the earthquake reached Illinois and to the east, the earthquake reached Fredericton, New Brunswick. Damage was reported as far away as Burlington, New Jersey.\nUnited States.\nMany buildings in the eastern United States are not built strongly enough that earthquakes cannot damage them. In Washington, D.C., the White House, the Capitol building and other buildings were evacuated. In Arlington County, Virginia, a pipe in the Pentagon broke. The pipe flooded two corridors. The Pentagon used an emergency plan put into place after the September 11 attacks to evacuate. Other buildings were evacuated in Philadelphia, Boston and New York City.\nSoon after the earthquake, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered airplanes to stop flying along the East Coast. The Air Traffic Control tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated. Flights were late at several airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Dulles International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport. At the National Airport, ceiling tiles in the airport terminal fell to the ground, and flights stopped. Washington Metro trains were delayed and run at reduced speeds of 15 miles per hour. This allowed engineers to see if the rails were damaged. Just after the earthquake, many people made cell phone calls. This tied up the AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless networks. People could not start phone calls for at least 20 minutes.\nBuildings in the Washington, D.C. area were damaged, but not severely. The quake damaged three of the Washington National Cathedral's four pinnacles (corner spires) and cracked some of the Episcopal church's flying buttresses. However, buttresses that support the central tower, a prominent part of the city skyline, look normal. The National Park Service found cracks near the top of the Washington Monument. The monument is closed indefinitely. The earthquake knocked off four of the six spires atop the Washington D.C. Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The pieces fell to the ground along with several pieces of marble from the temple's outside wall.\nThe two nuclear reactors at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, from the epicenter, shut down automatically.\nDamage in the northeastern United States was minor. In New York state, Governor Andrew Cuomo said the State Office of Emergency Management had no reports of damage to buildings or infrastructure. There were some disruptions, including building evacuations and delays at airports. Amtrak trains arriving and departing from Penn Station were also delayed.\nIn New Jersey, the state Emergency Management office reported two gas leaks in Gloucester County, with no reports of injuries from either leak. Buildings such a the Temple B'nai Israel in Burlington and a home in Camden were damaged. Government buildings were evacuated, and city workers could go home.\nIn Boston, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency reported no injuries or damage. The U.S. District Court in South Boston was evacuated and the University of Massachusetts Boston cut summer classes short and sent all workers home early.\nIn West Virginia, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, and several other buildings in downtown Charleston were evacuated. Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 calls in 45 minutes but there were no reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old . Part of a chimney collapsed at the county courthouse in Philippi in Barbour County. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors.\nIn Delaware, the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington and Family Court in Georgetown were evacuated. The press said that blocks fell to the street from the steeple of St. Thomas the Apostle Church. DelDOT crews were sent to all parts of the state to inspect many bridges and roadways including interstate highways and the Indian River Inlet Bridge.\nIn Pennsylvania, people were told to get out of office buildings in Philadelphia. People were also told to get out of the Bucks County Courthouse in Doylestown. Also, SEPTA Regional Rail trains could only go while tracks were checked for damage and PATCO Speedline trains were also stopped for a short time even though there was no damage. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation checked bridges for damage. There was no damage to the bridges over the Delaware River owned by the Delaware River Port Authority.\nCanada.\nPeople in eastern Canada also felt the earthquake, mostly in Southern Ontario, as well as parts of Quebec and the Maritimes. A few buildings in Toronto were evacuated. No accidents or damage from the earthquake were reported in Canada.\nSocial media.\nAccording to Facebook, the word \"earthquake\" appeared in the status updates of 3 million users within four minutes of the quake. Twitter said users were sending up to 5,500 tweets per second. This rate of messages was faster than during the death of Osama bin Laden.

Nowadays much information is got by 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis.\nHistory.\nFor correct publication of a species, bacteria must be isolated, cultured, described, and deposited in a bacteriology culture collection. However, some bacteria require special tissue culture conditions and cannot be maintained in Bacteriology Culture Collections. This includes bacteria which live inside other organisms or cells. These include obligately intracellular pathogens and endosymbionts, insect symbionts, and populations from oceans or sludge. \nIn 1994, Murray and Schleifer published a taxonomic note. They recommended that the new category of indefinite rank (Candidatus) be established for certain putative taxa that could not be described in sufficient detail to warrant establishment of a new taxon.

{"id": "305725", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305725", "title": "French Civil Aviation University", "text": "The French Civil Aviation University (French: \"\u00c9cole nationale de l'aviation civile\"), also known as ENAC, is a French public aeronautical \"grande \u00e9cole.\" It was created on 28 August 1949. It has locations in Biscarosse, Carcassonne, Castelnaudary, Ch\u00e2teau-Arnoux-Saint-Auban, Grenoble, Melun, Montpellier, Muret, Saint-Yan and Toulouse, in France. It is a member of the \"Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles\", the University of Toulouse, and of the Aerospace Valley. It is one of five founders of France AEROTECH.\nENAC provides training in civil aeronautics. The university has around 25 courses. These include aerospace engineering, Masters, \"Mast\u00e8res Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s\", and courses for technicians, airline pilots, air traffic controllers, managers and flight instructors (people who teach others to fly planes).\nHistory.\n1945 - 1949.\nAir travel grew rapidly in France after World War II. Safe air transport required staff trained specifically for this activity. It also required people in different sectors of the aviation world to work together and understand each other. That is why ENAC was started. Max Hymans, the secretary general of civil and commercial aviation, was the chief organiser.\n1949 - 1955.\nENAC was created on 28 August 1949 (Decree 49-1205) in Paris. The university was located in Orly, south of Paris. Ren\u00e9 Lemaire considers ENAC as \"a university of aviation safety\". \nA report of the \"Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'aviation civile\" said: \"It was in the minds of the creators of the university, to develop between the crew and the ground staff a community of ideas, reciprocal knowledge, and esteem, that are essential for the teamwork required by air transport.\" Training courses were longer or shorter depending on specialty.\n1955 - 1959.\nThe decree of 13 October 1959 announced the first partner of the university: Air France. It resulted in a sharing of tasks. It also established recruitment for airline pilots students with no previous flight experience. In 1958, the university already welcomed the first airline pilots students, on an experimental basis.\nENAC cooperated with the \"\u00c9cole nationale de la m\u00e9t\u00e9orologie\" (National School of Meteorology). It promoted the teaching of this subject for air traffic controllers. After World War II, ENAC helped the conversion of military aircrew. The \"Service de l'aviation l\u00e9g\u00e8re et sportive\" (SALS), under the decree of 31 March 1951, provided free flight training for airline pilot candidates coming from the army.\nFrom 1949 to 1959, the number of courses held increased from 6 to 64. The number of students increased from 49 to 800. In 1956, the navigation instructor rating was created. A training programme also started. In 1958, the airline pilot theoretical training course started.\nIt had rites such as a reception in full uniform by local authorities when university officials and students arrived at a new location.\nENAC Orly also held a yearly trip for all the students. \n1959 - 1968.\nThe university moved to Toulouse in 1968. The main campus is still there in 2020. It also changed from an external department of the French civil aviation administration to a public administration institution in 1970.\nThe French Civil Aviation University was started close to Paris-Orly Airport. This location was near the largest French airport at the time. It offered easy use of airplanes for a lot of activities such as navigation flights and promotional trips. It was also close to many airlines and aircraft manufacturers or businesses related to the aviation industry. The managers of these businesses often gave lectures and conferences at the university.\nTraffic at Paris-Orly Airport grew rapidly at the beginning of the 1950s. In the mid-1950s plans began for a new location near to Parisian airports. The potential locations were all less than 150\u00a0km from Paris, for example Melun, Pontoise, Coulommiers, \u00c9tampes, Reims, \u00c9vreux, Chartres, and Orleans. A report dated 20 May 1959 lists the disadvantages of a location too far from Paris. Ren\u00e9 Lemaire gave a report on 14June 1960 in which he supported a transfer to Toulouse. The \"\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs de constructions a\u00e9ronautiques\" settled in Toulouse in 1961 and the \"\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace\" was also going to move from Paris to Toulouse. On the 15 June 1961 Prime Minister Michel Debr\u00e9 accepted the transfer to Toulouse. His successor Georges Pompidou confirmed the transfer in a letter dated 23 July 1963.\nThe construction of new buildings on the campus of Rangueil began in April 1966. The project ended on 19 August 1968. The academic year started on 16 September 1968. 500 students started, including 325 who started their training. These trainees were as follows: 15 air navigation engineering student (mostly from the \"\u00c9cole Polytechnique)\", 70 engineering students in air navigation from two-years studies after the French Baccalaureate (the main end of school exams in France), 60 airline pilot students, 100 air traffic controller students, 40 electronics students, 20 commercial pilot students and 20 flight dispatcher students.\n1968 - 1975.\nBefore the university opened its doors to its new campus, the \"Commission permanente\" took into consideration the problem of an inadequate (not good enough) legal status. This problem was old. It was identified soon after the creation of the university. ENAC was supervised closely. There were many inspection reports. On average, these usually happened once every two years, sometimes more often. The management of the institution was judged severely (strictly). In the mid-1950s, some reports said the university was not allowed to exist, for example, the confidential report of Brancourt Controller on 12 March 1952. Some reports said that the university had \"a lack of doctrine\", and that \"there is a certain tension with the training center of Air France\", and even that \"ENAC is madness\".\nThe final decision is taken by Decree No. 70-347 of 13 April 1970. It was applied on 1 January 1971. ENAC received a board of directors when it became a public administrative institution. Ren\u00e9 Lemaire was the first president.\n1975 - 1990.\nFrom 1975 a new thing is starting. It consists of an increase of the proportion of engineering students called \"civilians\" in opposition to the \"officials\" (civil servants) engineering students. ENAC is becoming a major player in the training for aerospace industry (civilian personnel), while its primary goal was only the training of officials for \"direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'aviation civile\". It is true that the existence of students for the private sector is not new at the university : it was in 1956 that are trained the first of them. At the end of 1950s, however, this recruitment affects only a minority of students. It is primarily done to compensate the disadvantage which consists of the highly different number of students to work in the administration and to prevent the size of successive promotions with a too great difference. However, this second source tends to become more and more important, to finally become the first one. This results in an revision of the teachings. ENAC engineering education, particularly that of the specialty called \"facilities\" - it focuses on electronics - seduce the industrial sectors of electronics and information technology. Without having particularly desired, the university has progressively the role of a National University of Engineers.\nIndustry oriented university, research appeared in 1984, following the law on Higher education which provides that \"engineering education [...] has a research activity, basic or applied, \" and is organized around four areas: electronics, automation, computer and air transport economy. The university then feels interest for future engineers to learn research methods: while the method of deductive reasoning, for a long time favored by teachers in the two-years studies after French high school diploma and universities, shows its limitations, the method of inductive reasoning, characteristic of research, appears progressively better adapted to the nature of functions performed by today's engineers. The most recent manifestation of the growing interest in research at ENAC is the creation of the air transport economics laboratory, which designation reflects the desire to study, in addition to air transport itself, certain related activities such as air navigation.\nThe mid 1980s saw the emergence of \"mast\u00e8res sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s\" programs. They are born for most of them from an industrial demand, including the \"groupement des industries fran\u00e7aises a\u00e9ronautiques et spatiales\", in order to support the export contracts by training. Indeed, while filling the needs of many French students or professionals, they can train in a relatively short period some foreign executives. The same period saw the diversification of continuing education at the university. The continuing education courses are organized in five main areas: air traffic systems, electronics, computer, aeronautics and languages/humanities.\n1990 - today.\nThe international dimension of the university grew in the 1990s. It is constrained, however, by the design and implementation of the new cycle for air traffic controllers. The effort required a specifically European component. It consists first in the participation in European projects such as EATCHIP (European Air Traffic control Harmonization and Integration Program), then in joining mobility programs for students such as Erasmus or Socrates. Under these programs, the university welcomes a growing number of foreign students. In doing so, it forges close relations with foreign universities, including those of Berlin and Darmstadt in Germany, as well as the one of Tampere in Finland. Since 1990, the university has new missions. Thus, ENAC negotiates new contracts for studies and research abroad. The 2000s are the years of the creation of courses entirely taught in English language and the development of activities focused on air navigation. In 2009, the university and its alumni association organize the first edition of the \"salon du livre a\u00e9ronautique\" (aeronautical literary festival) in Toulouse. In December 2010, ENAC becomes an ICAO center for training in aviation security.\nMeanwhile, the university develops new teaching facilities: the air traffic control simulator \"CAUTRA\", the aerodrome control simulator \"AERSIM\", an Airbus A320 flight management system simulator, a static model of the Airbus A321' s engine and the laboratory of telecom networks.\nSince the 1st January 2011 and the merging of ENAC with the SEFA, the university is the biggest European aviation university.\nIn 2013, ENAC starts with the DGAC the consulting company France Aviation Civile Services.\nHeads history.\nThe current head of the university is Olivier Chansou, after Marc Houalla who was SEFA director from 2006 till the 1th of January 2011. It is the eighth person to be director since 1949. He was elected the 27th of November 2017. The directors since 1949 are given in the following table.\nAdministration.\nGovernance.\nAs all the equivalent universities in France, ENAC is managed by a President elected by a board of directors. He is member of the three councils of the university :\nIn addition to these three councils, the university has a director's office which includes communication and cultural affairs, a division of information systems and a general secretariat dedicated to legal management, logistics, financial and human resources.\nBudget.\nThe university has spent for its operation 126 million euros in 2011. The budget is up 61.12% compared to 2010 as a result of its merger with the SEFA and consists of:\nENAC fondation.\nIn consideration for several months, a corporate foundation has been established in September 2011. It aims to guide the training and research council on the changes to be made to the training \"Ing\u00e9nieur ENAC\" (ENAC engineer) and to the corporate partnerships.\nIt consists of technical and human resources managers from aerospace companies such as Air France, Airbus, A\u00e9roport de Paris, Rockwell Collins, Thal\u00e8s, \"A\u00e9roconseil\"...\nCampuses.\nENAC has eight campuses and can provide accommodation. It also has a canteen, cafeteria, library, computer rooms, sports halls including a fitness room, a sports field, a rugby field, five tennis courts, a beach volleyball and a golf driving range. Its main campus is located at Rangueil (Toulouse).\nSince its merger with the SEFA, ENAC has eight locations :\nEquipment.\nENAC has a fleet of 130 aircraft of different types: CAP-10, Socata TB-10, Socata TB-20, Beechcraft Baron 58, Beechcraft 200, ATR 42, Diamond DA40 (to replace the Socata TB-20) and Diamond DA42 (to replace the Beechcraft Baron 58).\nOn its Toulouse campus, the university has flight simulator Robin DR400 and Socata TB-20, and also some static simulators of Airbus A320 and Airbus A340.\nIn the air navigation department, it has control tower simulators (at 120 or 360 degrees).\nTeaching and research.\nInitial training.\nENAC has four Bachelor's degree courses to train pilots and aerospace technicians.\nENAC provide theoretical training for pilot students in eight months in its campus of Toulouse. Practical training of 16 months is given in the other campuses of the university in Montpellier, Carcassonne, Saint-Yan or Muret. There is also training for various aviation technicians.\nIn addition, the university has seven Master's degree programs to train people for both aerospace industry and French civil aviation authority.\nCourses of Air traffic controller and Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel are done by the university. The \"Ing\u00e9nieur ENAC\" course trains aerospace engineer in three sectors : electronics and aeronautical telecommunications (L), computer systems and air traffic (S) and aeronautical engineering (T). The university has created in 2007 a Master's degree in International Air Transport Op\u00e9ration Management, in 2011 the course Master's degree in Global Navigation Satellite System supported by the European Commission and in 2012 the Master's degree in Air Traffic Management in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Master's degree in Human\u2013computer interaction (IHM) is realized in cooperation with the Paul Sabatier University.\nFinally, the French Civil Aviation University provides nine \"Mast\u00e8res Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s\" courses in the fields : airport management, air transport management (in partnership with Toulouse Business School), communication - navigation - surveillance and satellite applications for aviation, aviation safety aircraft airworthiness (in partnership with other \"grandes \u00e9coles\"), air-ground collaborative systems engineering, aviation and air traffic management and aerospace project management (APM) (in partnership with other \"grandes \u00e9coles\").\nThe former students of the three Master programs, the \"Ing\u00e9nieur ENAC\" course, as well as those of the Corps of Bridges and Roads and those of the \"Mast\u00e8res Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s\" courses was represented by an association, INGENAC, created in 1988, member of the CNISF (French scientific and engineer council) and in Toulouse. The 16th of March 2012, INGENAC decided to represent all the former students of the university and changes its name to \u00ab ENAC Alumni \u00bb.\nEach course of the university has its own recruitment process.\nContinuing education.\nBy hosting each year more than 7,500 students who participate to more than 600 courses annually organized by the university, with a turnover of 15 million of euros, ENAC is now the largest organization in Europe for aeronautical continuing education. The continuing education of ENAC has been developed in areas which ENAC is well recognized : air traffic, electronics, computer science, aeronautical engineering, aircraft control, ...\nInternational partners.\nStudents of the aerospace engineer course can study at the two other \"grandes \u00e9coles\" members of the \"groupement des \u00e9coles d'a\u00e9ronautique\", and also at the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse and at Nantes business school. Moreover, as part of France AEROTECH, an exchange of third year engineering students is under elaboration with the \"grandes \u00e9coles\" of this network.\nIn another country, students have access to the Erasmus programme and to Pegasus. In the aerospace engineer course, the university welcomes 8% of foreign students in 2011. Considering all the courses, this number is 46% in 2010.\nThe university has also agreements with : Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida Institute of Technology, University of California, University of Washington, \"\u00c9cole africaine de la m\u00e9t\u00e9orologie et de l'aviation civile\". It also educates people of the \"Agence pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la navigation a\u00e9rienne en Afrique et \u00e0 Madagascar\".\nAlso, ENAC is a founder of the \"Institut sino-europ\u00e9en d'ing\u00e9nierie de l'aviation\" of Tianjin. On this city, the university has four \"Mast\u00e8res Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s\" courses at the Civil Aviation University of China only for Chinese students : airport management, aviation safety management - airworthiness, aviation safety management - flight operations and aviation safety management - aeronautical maintenance.\nFinally, in December 2011, the university has signed a partnership with the \"\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech\" and the \"Acad\u00e9mie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile\" to start an Executive MBA in aviation management for aerospace people in March 2012 at Casablanca.\nResearch activities.\nResearch is a growing business at ENAC. Industry oriented university, it appears in 1984, following the law on higher education which provides that \u00ab engineer training...contains a research activity, pure or applied \u00bb. It was originally organized around four areas : electronics, automation, computer and air transport economy. Mid-2009, the research teams was in the following laboratories : automation - operational research (LARA), economy - air econometrics (LEEA), study - optimization of telecommunications networks architectures (LEOPART), electromagnetism for aeronautical telecommunications (LETA), interactive computer (LII), applied mathematics (LMA), air traffic optimization (LOTA) and signal processing for the aeronautical telecommunications (LTST).\nENAC also has, since 2005, a team specializing in UAVs that maintains and develops \"Paparazzi\", a free system for automatic control of UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicle laboratory. The infrastructure includes also a planetarium and an air traffic control simulator. ENAC is a founding member of the European academy for aviation safety (EAFAS), network of the key training organizations in the field of air safety.\nDuring the Paris Air Show of 2005, the university announces a partnership with \"Office National d'\u00c9tudes et de Recherches A\u00e9rospatiales\" in the fields of air traffic management, air safety, satellite navigation, sustainable development and air transport economy.\nEnd of 2011, the university has established a new research organization that are six transverse programs : UAVs and air traffic management, airports, aircraft and air operations, human-computer interaction, air/ground communications and sustainable development, everything is now based on four laboratories : applied mathematics - optimization - optimal control - control engineering operations research (MAIAA), signal processing - satellite positioning system - electromagnetism - networks (TELECOM), architecture - modeling - engineering of interactive systems (LII) and economics - air transport econometrics (LEEA).\nFamous people.\nAlumni.\nSeveral famous pilots have studied at the French Civil Aviation University like \u00c9mile Allegret, soldier and member of the French Resistance during the World War II, Xavier Barral (Promotion 1966), former President of the \"association des professionnels navigants de l'aviation\" (Professional aircrew association), No\u00ebl Chevrier (Promotion 1970), antistress center manager at Air France, G\u00e9rard Feldzer (Promotion 1971), former President of the \"A\u00e9ro-Club de France\", Bernard Pestel (Promotion 1972), vice president of the \"soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de droit a\u00e9rien\" (French Air Law company), B\u00e9atrice Vialle (Promotion 1981), one of the two female Concorde pilot and the first French female pilot on a supersonic airliner.\nParticularly because of its status of a French civil servant university, some civil servant has been student at ENAC like Jean-Marc de Raffin Dourny (Promotion 1966), President of the \"organisme pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'aviation civile\" (organization for the safety of civil aviation), Michel Bernard (Promotion 1967), former head of the \"Agence nationale pour l'emploi\" and former President of \"Air Inter\", Paul-Louis Arslanian (Promotion 1968), former head of the French \"Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile\", Jean-Paul Troadec (Promotion 1970), head of the \"Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile\", Patrick Ky (Promotion 1989), head of the EASA, Michel Wachenheim (Promotion 1975), French ambassador.\nSome alumni of the university became managers like Yves Lambert (Promotion 1959), former head of Eurocontrol, G\u00e9rard Mestrallet (Promotion 1971), CEO of GDF Suez., Jean-Michel Vernhes (Promotion 1971), head of the Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, Jean-Charles Corbet (Promotion 1974), former head of \"Air Lib\", Olivier Cola\u00eftis (Promotion 1977), President of Galileo, Lionel Gu\u00e9rin, founding President of Airlinair, Philippe Cr\u00e9bassa, head of Toulouse-Blagnac airport, Franck Goldnadel (Promotion 1990), former head of the Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, R\u00e9gis Lacote (Promotion 1997), head of the Orly Airport, M\u00e9ziane Idjerouid\u00e8ne (Promotion 2003), general manager of Aigle Azur.\nFew intellectuals graduate from the university like Jacques Villiers (Promotion 1948), founder of the \"Centre d'\u00e9tudes de la navigation a\u00e9rienne\" (French air navigation center), Jean Peyrelevade (Promotion 1961), politician and business leader, Hamza Ben Driss Ottmani (Promotion 1963), Moroccan economist and writer, Alain Lefebvre (Promotion 1970), Journalist, Solenn Coll\u00e9ter (Promotion 1993), novelist., Nicolas Tenoux (Promotion 2007), Philanthropist.\nIn science, personalities like Gabriel Weishaupt (Promotion 1948), founding member of the \"Acad\u00e9mie de l'air et de l'espace\", Jean Robieux, Physicist, Georges Maignan (Promotion 1955), former director of the experimental center of Eurocontrol, G\u00e9rard Desbois (Promotion 1979), younger flight engineer graduate and crew member during the first flight of the Airbus A380, have studied at the university.\nTeachers and former teachers.\nSome aerospace personalities teach at the university such as Herv\u00e9 Hallot, meteorology teacher and co-author of \"M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie a\u00e9ronautique\", Joel Laitselart (TAE 87), air operations teacher and former operations manager of Aeris airline, Patrick Lepourry, head of the engine department and co-author of \"Propulseurs a\u00e9ronautiques\", \"Instruments de bord\" and \"Initiation \u00e0 l'a\u00e9ronautique\", F\u00e9lix Mora-Camino, head of the control engineering department and co-author of \"Avionique -

Twenty students started the training. At that time, the course was in four years and the first promotion is graduated in 1965. The same year, the Alumni association is created in Paris by Maurice Ribonnet. In 1982, the first trip for students is organized in Guyana at the European Space Agency center. The year 1987 saw the university bought by Henri Hertert (IPSA 1976 and pilot at Air France). The institute moved in 1989 into the towers \"Les Mercuriales\" at Bagnolet, in which it stayed for ten years. Then, beset by financial difficulties, the university is bought by IONIS Education Group in 1999 and moved at Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre close to the university EPITA.\n1999 - today.\nIn 2005, the Master issued by IPSA is recognized by French State at the higher level, after accreditation by the \"Commission nationale de la certification professionnelle\". The year 2006 sees the institute hosting the 6th European Congress of the Mars Society to promote the exploration of Mars. In 2007, IPSA opens a second campus in Toulouse, joins the Erasmus programme and concludes double degree agreements with foreign universities. Following its establishment in Toulouse, the university joins the \"Institut au service du spatial, de ses applications et technologies\" during the year 2008. The next year, IPSA joins Aerospace Valley and moved in Ivry-sur-Seine close to the university ESME-Sudria, before being recognized by the French State in 2010.\nIn 2011, the university is accredited by the \"Commission des titres d'ing\u00e9nieur\".

Afterwards he became one of the most important medieval saints of England, his cult being centred at Durham Cathedral. Cuthbert is regarded as the patron saint of northern England. His feast day is 20 March.\nBiography.\nIn 676 he began the life of a hermit and retired to a cave on Lindisfarne. After a time he settled on one of the Farne Islands, south of Lindisfarne, and made his life more simple. \nIn 684, Cuthbert was chosen to be bishop of Lindisfarne, at a synod at Twyford (believed to be present-day Alnmouth), but was unwilling to leave his retirement and take up his charge. It was only after a visit from a large group, including King Ecgfrith, that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop. He was consecrated at York on 26 March 685. After Christmas, 686, however, he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island, which was where he eventually died on 20 March 687 AD. He was buried at Lindisfarne, and his remains later moved to Durham Cathedral."}

It is renowned first Belgian Aviation School and then Sabena Air Training Center, and the school moved into a new building at Brussels National Airport. It was decided to carry out practical training in flight to Phoenix in U.S.A because the weather in Arizona allows flights 365 days per year in a high and complex air traffic. Despite the bankruptcy of Sabena in 2001, the activities didn't stop. In 2004, the school was sold to two former managers of Sabena and became the Sabena Flight Academy.\nThe acquisition by CAE.\nIt is finally absorbed in 2008 by the Canadian group CAE.

They were the four divisions of an Indian army at the time, and no doubt the game was thought of as a war-game. At that time the game had no female piece: what we now call the queen was called \"Mantri\", meaning a minister or advisor.\nThe game eventually spread to the rest of the world after the Muslim conquest of Persia. It was then called Shatranj.\nFrom the beginning until the end of the 15th century the pieces we call bishops and queens had limited movement, and it took longer to get the pieces into action.

These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.\nThe game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names; in Arabic \"m\u0101t\" or \"m\u0101ta\" \u0645\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064e means \"died\", \"is dead\". In Arabic, the game became Shatranj.

Most times, the reaction involves organometallic complexes. The reaction path has coordination of a hydrocarbon to the inner-sphere of the metal atom (\u201cM\u201d). The reaction path includes either an intermediate \u201calkane or arene complex\u201d or as a transition state leading to a \"M-C\" intermediate. The reaction path makes C-H activation different from other reactions. During the C-H breaking event the hydrocarbyl group remains linked in the inner-sphere and under the influence of the metal atom.\nChemists study C-H activation because for many years chemists believed that C-H bonds were unreactive. Both theoretical studies as well as experiments now show that C-H bonds can be broken. This is done by a nearby metal atom changing the electron distribution of the C-H bond (coordination). Much chemical research looks at the design and synthesis of new reagents and catalysts that can affect C-H activation. The goal of this research is the conversion of cheap and abundant alkanes into valuable functionalized organic compounds.\nHistorians say that Otto Dimroth discovered the first C-H activation reaction. In 1902, he reported that benzene reacted with mercury(II) acetate (See: organomercury), but some scholars do not view this reaction as being a C-H activation. Goldman &amp; Goldberg later wrote, C-H activation looks like H-H activation: both can be achieved by electrophilic or oxidative addition. The first true C-H activation reaction was reported by Joseph Chatt in 1965 with insertion of a ruthenium atom ligated to dmpe in the C-H bond of naphthalene. "}

Topics in chemistry education include understanding how students learn chemistry and how best to teach chemistry. Researchers in chemistry education try to improve learning results by improving teaching methods and training chemistry teachers. Researchers study many teaching modes, including: classroom lecture, demonstrations, and laboratory activities.\nThere is a world-wide shortage of chemistry teachers. This is because people with science training can get jobs that pay more outside of teaching. It is hard to keep science teachers. More than 45,000 math and science teachers left teaching in the United States just after the 1999\u20132000 school year.\nOverview.\nThere are several different ways of thinking about chemistry education. One is a \"practitioner\u2019s perspective\". The people who teach chemistry define chemistry education by their actions.\nAnother is defined by a self-identified group of \"chemical educators\" (faculty members and instructors who focus on teaching rather than focus on chemical research). Dr. Robert L. Lichter, then-Executive Director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, speaking in a plenary session at the 16th Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (recent BCCE meetings: ,), posed the question \u201cwhy do terms like \u2018chemical educator\u2019 even exist in higher education, when there is a perfectly respectable term for this activity, namely, \u2018chemistry professor.\u2019\" One criticism of this view is that few professors bring any formal preparation in education or background about education to their jobs. Most chemistry professors do not have a professional perspective on teaching and learning efforts. They may not know about effective teaching methods and how students learn.\nA third perspective is \"chemical education research\" (CER). Following the example of physics education research (PER), CER tends to take the theories and methods developed in pre-college science education research and applies them to understanding comparable problems in post-secondary settings. (CER also tries to improve pre-college chemistry instruction). Like science education researchers, CER practitioners tend to study the teaching practices of others as opposed to focusing on their own classroom practices. Chemical education research is typically carried out \"in situ\" using human subjects from secondary and post-secondary schools. Chemical education research collects both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative methods typically involve collecting data that can then be analyzed using various statistical methods. Qualitative methods include interviews, observations, journaling, and other methods common to social science research."}

It is used to make polycarbonate plastic, epoxy resins, and other things.\nScientist discovered in the mid 1930s that people and animals react to BPA in the same way that they react to hormone (oestrogen-like effects.) Some stores stopped selling products made with BPA in 2008 because government reports said BPA was not safe for humans. Many news stories wrote about BPA safety. \nA 2010 report from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that contact with BPA could hurt fetuses (unborn children), infants and young children. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to say that BPA was a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA cannot be used to make baby bottles.\nHealth effects.\nBisphenol\u00a0A damages the way hormones regulate (control) the human body (endocrine disruptor). BPA can pretend to be the body's own hormones. BPA may cause health problems. Very young children are most sensitive to BPA. Some studies have shown that there is a link (connection) between BPA exposure before birth (prenatal) and later problems of the nervous system. Health organizations have decided how much BPA (in a substance) is safe for people. But new studies have caused other scientists and health organizations to disagree with these decisions. A 2011 study that investigated the number of chemicals to which pregnant women in the U.S. are exposed found BPA in 96% of women.\nIn 2009, The Endocrine Society said it was worried about current human exposure to BPA.\nIn 2011, the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency's chief scientist said \"the evidence [is] that BPA is rapidly absorbed, detoxified, and eliminated from humans \u2013 therefore is not a health concern.\"\nExpert panel conclusions.\nIn 2007, 38 experts on bisphenol\u00a0A wrote a consensus statement which said average levels in people are above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments. However, the experts noted that 1) BPA is not persistent in the environment or in humans, 2) biomonitoring surveys indicate that exposure is continuous, 3) it is hard to use acute animal exposure studies to estimate daily human exposure to BPA, and 4) no studies that had examined BPA pharmacokinetics in animal models had followed continuous low level exposures. The measurement of BPA levels in human serum and other body fluids suggests that either BPA intake is much higher than previously thought or that BPA can bioaccumulate in some conditions such as pregnancy, or both. A 2011 study, the first to examine BPA in a continuous low level exposure throughout the day, did find an increased absorption and accumulation of BPA in the blood of mice.\nIn 2007, 153 government-funded BPA experiments on lab animals and tissues found adverse effects and 14 did not. In contrast, all 13 studies funded by chemical corporations reported no harm. The studies indicating harm reported a variety of deleterious effects in rodent offspring exposed in the womb: abnormal weight gain, insulin resistance, prostate cancer, and too much mammary gland development. \nA panel convened by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in 2007 determined that there was \"some concern\" about BPA's effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior. The concern over the effect of BPA on infants was also heightened by the fact that infants and children are estimated to have the highest daily intake of BPA. A 2008 report by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) later agreed with the panel, expressing \"some concern for effects on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to bisphenol\u00a0A,\" and \"\"minimal\" concern for effects on the mammary gland and an earlier age for puberty for females in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to bisphenol\u00a0A.\" The NTP had \"\"negligible\" concern that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol\u00a0A will result in fetal or neonatal mortality, birth defects, or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring.\""}

The name of the group means \"Western\" or \"non-Islamic\" education is a sin. The group is centred in Borno State in northeastern Nigeria. It wants to make Islamic law the only law in Nigeria. It also wants to outlaw education that is not based on Islam. The group sees itself as similar to the Taliban, which are active in Afghanistan. Locally, the group is known as the \"Taliban\". The official name of the group is \"Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad\", which in Arabic means \"People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad.\" They also call themselves 'Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\nThe group was formed in Maiduguri, Borno State, in 2002. Its insurgency began in 2009. They follow an extreme version of Sunni Islam. Local residents of the area soon called the group Boko Haram. Loosely translated from the local Hausa language, this means Western education is forbidden. Residents gave it the name because of its strong opposition to Western education, which it sees as corrupting Muslims. The term \"Boko Haram\" comes from the Hausa word 'boko' meaning \"Animist, western or otherwise non-Islamic education\" and the Arabic word 'haram' figuratively meaning \"sin\" (literally, \"forbidden\").\nBoko Haram opposes not only Western education, but Western culture and science as well. The group also forbids the wearing of shirts and trousers and the act of voting in elections. In its view, the Nigerian state is run by non-believers.\nIn a 2009 BBC interview, Mohammed Yusuf, the group's leader at the time, said he rejects the fact that the earth is a sphere and views it as contrary to Islam, along with Darwinism and the fact that rain comes from water evaporated by the sun.\nBoko Haram often carry out bombings, kidnappings and shootings, as well as arson and looting. They have killed thousands of people in Africa, attacking civilian and military targets. There are many terrorist activities for which Boko Haram have claimed responsibility: \nBoko Haram is not associated with the group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta which fights against the oil industry in the Niger Delta, since 2006.\nOn 14 April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 teenagers from a secondary school in Chibok, Borno. Boko Haram killed at least 100 people in Baga, Borno, in January 2015. About 620 buildings were damaged or destroyed by fire.\nIn the mid-2010s, Boko Haram extended its activities into Cameroon, Chad and Niger. It became part of Islamic State in March 2015."}

Many people in the delta are poor. The Nigerian government has contracts that allow international companies to extract crude oil in the delta. This extraction causes massive damage to the environment. According to the magazine \"The Economist\", the organization wants more of the profit of the oil extraction to go to the poor region, where the oil is extracted. \nAccording to the magazine, the organisation is used by several armed groups; these groups are sometimes paid to launch attacks. The payment is done either with weapons or with money.\nMEND has been linked to attacks on petroleum operations in Nigeria as part of the Conflict in the Niger Delta, engaging in actions including sabotage, theft, property destruction, guerrilla warfare, and kidnapping.\nMEND's stated goals are to localize control of Nigeria's oil and to secure reparations from the federal government for pollution caused by the oil industry. In an interview with one of the group's leaders, who used the alias Major-General Godswill Tamuno, the BBC reported that MEND was fighting for \"total control\" of the Niger Delta's oil wealth, saying local people had not gained from the riches under the ground and the region's creeks and swamps.\" \nIn a January 2006 email, MEND warned the oil industry, \"It must be clear that the Nigerian government cannot protect your workers or assets. Leave our land while you can or die in it... Our aim is to totally destroy the capacity of the Nigerian government to export oil.\" Additionally MEND has called upon President Olusegun Obasanjo to free two jailed Ijaw leaders \u2014 Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who is jailed and charged with treason, and Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a former governor of Bayelsa State convicted of corruption. Obasanjo's successor, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua authorised the release of Dokubo-Asari and Alamieyeseigha in 2007."}

The base of the word is the Latin \"urbs\", which means city. The term urbanisation means that lifestyle that is common in a city becomes prevalent. This can happen in two different ways:\nPhysical urbanization has been observed for centuries. In developing countries this is the main form of urbanization. In developed countries, functional urbanization is the main form of urbanization. With functional urbanization, people living in the city center move to the countryside, next to the city; this is known as suburbanization.\nEnvironmental effects.\nEnvironmental scientists are studying the urban heat island. The urban heat island is made when industrial and urban areas are developed and heat becomes plentiful. \nEnvironmental impacts also include reducing soil moisture and intensification of carbon dioxide emissions.\nStewart Brand's book \"Whole Earth Discipline\" argues that urbanization helps the environment overall. First, the birth rate of new urban dwellers falls immediately to replacement rate, and keeps falling. This can prevent overpopulation in the future. Secondly, it puts a stop to destructive subsistence farming methods, like slash and burn agriculture. Finally, it reduces land use by humans, leaving more for nature."}

In a conrotatory mode, the substituents located at the ends of a conjugated double bond system move in the same (clockwise or counterclockwise) direction during ring opening or ring closure. In a disrotatory mode, they move in opposite directions.\nAn example is the conversion of trans-cis-trans-2,4,6-octatriene to cis-dimethylcyclohexadiene (top of figure). The orbital mechanics of the reaction needs a disrotatory mode. The orbital symmetry of the octatriene's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) requires for the end pi orbitals to move in opposite directions to form the correct symmetry found in the sigma bond.\nThermal rearrangements of all conjugated systems containing 4n + 2 pi electron are stereospecific. This is based on preservation of orbital symmetry in the highest occupied molecular orbital. Systems containing 4n pi electrons show the opposite conrotatory mode. This is also true for rearrangements of 4n + 2 pi (where n is a whole number) electrons driven by light (photoinduced). Photoinduced rearrangements of 4n pi electron systems (where the number of electrons is divisible by 4) follow the disrotatory rule.\nThe Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules summarize the above different reactions.\nThe following picture also shows the difference between conrotatory and disrotatory reactions:"}

Their origin is Arab, and they are mainly from Hadrami. Until 1919, they were part of Dutch East Indies' law. Some people later gained economic power through real estate investment and trading. Currently, most of them can be found in Java and South Sumatra. They are almost all (generally orthodox) Muslims.\nHistory.\nIndonesia has had contact with the Arab world for hundreds of years. This was even before the development of Islam in Indonesia. Most contact was with spice traders. The first Arab settlements in the archipelago may have started in the fifth century. These early communities took over much of the local culture. Some of them disappeared completely while others formed ethnic groups.\nModern Arab Indonesians are descended from Hadramis, who came to Indonesia during the Dutch colonial period. The men often married native women. They were classified as \"foreign orientals\" along with Chinese Indonesians. This class stopped them from going to certain schools and also restricted their travel. They were also only allowed to live in special Arab districts, called \"kampung Arab\" in Indonesian. These laws were removed in 1919.\nThe community elites began to build economic power through trade and real estate investment. They bought large amounts of real estate in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), Singapore and other parts of this area. Arab Indonesians did charity work, and built and protected their social capital. Eventually, some Arab Indonesians joined the \"Volksraad\", the people's council of the Dutch East Indies.\nDuring the Indonesian National Awakening, Arab Indonesians began to oppose native Indonesians and the Dutch. This caused the formation of organizations which were only for Arab Indonesians in 1913. These organizations viewed the Arabian peninsula as their homeland. In 1934, Abdurrahman Baswedan founded an Arab Indonesian nationalistic movement, Persatoean Arab Indonesia.\nAzyumardi Azra described Arab Indonesians as people who wish to remove local religious elements from Indonesian Islam. Indonesian critics of Arab influence in Indonesia point to the founding of the radical group Jemaah Islamiah (JI). Their leader is Laskar Jihad (LJ). After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 and the 2002 Bali bombing, the community came under suspicion.\nIdentity.\nFirst generation immigrants are called \"wul\u0101yt\u012b\" or \"totok\". They are a small minority of the Arab Indonesian population. The majority, \"muwallad\" (plural form: \"muwallad\u012bn\"), were born in Indonesia and may be of mixed heritage.\nDistribution.\nThe majority of Arab Indonesians live on Java, mostly in East Java. Some live in South Sumatra.\nReligion.\nArab Indonesians are almost all Muslim. According to the 2000 census, 98.27 percent of Arab Indonesians are Muslim, compared to 88.22 percent of the whole population. Historically, most have lived in \"kauman\", or the area around mosques, but this has changed in recent years. The majority are Sunni, people who follow the Shafi'i school of Islamic law. The Shia are a growing minority. Children are often sent to madrasahs.\nThe Islam practiced by Arab Indonesians is more orthodox than the local, indigenous-influenced forms like \"abangan\". Many Arab Indonesians try to convince local Muslims to follow a more orthodox form of Islam as well."}

The house was built in 1819 for Henry Pendleton. On August 19, 1994, Cuckoo was added to the list of National Register of Historic Places. The house is near the U.S. Route 33, which curves around the house. Cuckoo has Federal details and Colonial Revival elements from the early 20th century. The house is known for its design, prominence and its association with the Pendleton family of doctors. The house was named for the Cuckoo Tavern. The Pendleton family owns the house since its construction.\nHistory.\nThe first construction had a two storied front section with a one-story extension to the rear. The dining room and the winter kitchen were in the one-story section. Between 1839 and 1907 the house was owned by Dr. Philip Barbour Pendleton. He added a second floor to the rear part of the house and extended the main roof to cover the new rooms of the house. A later generation of Pendletons rebuilt the house in the Colonial Revival style after 1910. They added the present Neoclassical portico. The next owners, Anne Pendleton Forrest and Dr. William Mentzel Forrest, added to the back a design by architect Stanislaw J. Makielski of Charlottesville. The complex includes a number of outbuildings, including two separate doctor's office buildings, a garage, barn, a house for smoking, and the Pendleton family cemetery.\nDescription.\nCuckoo is a house made of bricks. It has two floors and a center-hall which is divided into three parts. Single rooms are flanking the stair hall. The house has a porch on its entire front. A semicircular closet with a small window is between the fireplaces of the rooms to the right of the center hall. The fireplaces and chimneys are on both sides of the elevation. The Makielski addition to the back of the house has a porch that echoes the curve of the closet. The addition includes a back stairway.\nOutbuildings.\nThe small doctor's office was probably built in the early-to-mid 19th century for Dr. Robert Barret. It is to the north of Cuckoo, and was moved to Cuckoo by Dr. Philip Barbour Pendleton before the American Civil War. The large doctor's office was built around 1888 for Dr. Eugene Pendleton. It was expanded to also include his son's practice around 1908. It was moved to Cuckoo in 1910 when Eugene moved there. The office was moved again in 1972 when the highway was built, and was used as a medical office by Dr. Eugene Barbour Pendleton until 1979. A house for smoking was built in the late 19th century, and a barn in the early 20th century. A garage was built in the 1930s. \nCemetery.\nThe Pendleton cemetery is in an oak grove at the top of a small rise about 1/4 mile from the house. It is surrounded by a low stone wall. The cemetery has three gravestones and several unmarked graves.\nRecent history.\nCuckoo was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 1994. The house was damaged in the 2011 Virginia earthquake. The tall chimneys broke down. "}

The result is a structural isomer of the original molecule. Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule. In the example below, the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2:\nIntermolecular rearrangements also take place. \nSometimes chemists draw diagrams with arrows that show how electrons are transferred between bonds during a rearrangement reaction. Many organic chemistry text books have such diagrams. But they do not tell the full story of the reaction mechanism. The actual mechanism of a rearrangement with an alkyl group moving is for the group to slide smoothly along a bond, not ionic bond-breaking and forming. One example of this is the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement:\nIn pericyclic reactions, the orbital interactions are important. The reactions can not be explained by a series of simple discrete electron transfers. But, the curved arrows showing a sequence of discrete electron transfers can give the same result as a rearrangement reaction. Yet, the diagrams are not necessarily realistic. In allylic rearrangement, the reaction is ionic.\nThree important rearrangement reactions are 1,2-rearrangements, pericyclic reactions and olefin metathesis.\n1,2-rearrangements.\nA 1,2-rearrangement is an organic reaction where a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in a chemical compound. In a 1,2 shift, the substituent moves between two adjacent atoms. But moves over larger distances are possible. Examples are the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement:\nand the Beckmann rearrangement:\nPericyclic reactions.\nA pericyclic reaction is a type of reaction with multiple carbon-carbon bond making and breaking. The transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry. The reaction progresses in a concerted fashion. Examples are hydride shifts\nand the Claisen rearrangement:\nOlefin metathesis.\nOlefin metathesis is a formal exchange of the alkylidene fragments in two alkenes. It is a catalytic reaction with carbene. It has transition metal carbene complex intermediates."}

According to IUPAC recommendations, macromolecules refer to the individual molecular chains and are the domain of chemistry. Polymers describe the bulk properties of polymer materials and belong to the field of polymer physics (a part of physics).\nThe different kinds of macromolecules include:\nPolymers are formed by polymerization of monomers. Chemists describe a polymer by its degree of polymerization, molar mass distribution, tacticity, copolymer distribution, the degree of branching, by its end-groups, crosslinks, and crystallinity. Chemists also study a polymer's thermal properties such as its glass transition temperature and melting temperature. Polymers in solution have special characteristics for solubility, viscosity and gelation.\nHistory.\nPolymer chemistry started by studying the long fibers in plants. The work of Henri Braconnot in 1777 and the work of Christian Sch\u00f6nbein in 1846 led to the discovery of nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose treated with camphor makes celluloid. Chemists dissolve celluloid in ether or acetone to make collodion. Doctors have used collodion as a wound dressing since the U.S. Civil War. Cellulose acetate was first prepared in 1865. In 1834, Friedrich Ludersdorf and Nathaniel Hayward independently discovered that adding sulfur to raw natural rubber (polyisoprene) helped prevent the material from becoming sticky. In 1844 Charles Goodyear received a U.S. patent for vulcanizing rubber with sulfur and heat. Thomas Hancock had received a patent for the same process in the UK the year before.\nIn 1884, Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber factory based on regenerated cellulose, or viscose rayon, as a substitute for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic polymer, a thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin called Bakelite. Around the same time, Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of N-carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles. But Leuchs did not call them polymers, possibly due to the strong views held by Emil Fischer, his direct supervisor, denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6,000 daltons. Cellophane was invented in 1908 by Jocques Brandenberger who squirted sheets of viscose rayon into an acid bath.\nIn 1922, Hermann Staudinger (a German chemist) proposed that polymers were long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds. He also proposed to name these compounds \"macromolecules\". Before that, scientists believed that polymers were clusters of small molecules (called colloids), without definite molecular weights, held together by an unknown force. Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1953.\nWallace Carothers invented the first synthetic rubber called neoprene in 1931. Neoprene was the first polyester. Carothers went on to invent nylon, a true silk replacement, in 1935. Paul Flory was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his work on polymer random coil configurations in solution in the 1950s. Stephanie Kwolek developed an aramid, or aromatic nylon named Kevlar, patented in 1966.\nThere are now a large number of commercial polymers. They include composite materials such as carbon fiber-epoxy, polystyrene-polybutadiene (HIPS), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). Chemists design commercial polymers to combine the best properties of their various components. For example, special polymers used in automobile engines are designed to work at high temperatures.\nIt took a long time before universities introduced teaching and research programs in polymer chemistry. \nAn \"Institut fur Makromolekulare Chemie was founded in 1940 in Freiburg, Germany under the direction of Hermann Staudinger. In America a \"Polymer Research Institute\" (PRI) was established in 1941 by Herman Mark at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now Polytechnic Institute of NYU). Several hundred graduates of PRI played an important role in the US polymer industry and academia. Other PRI's were founded in 1961 by Richard S. Stein at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1967 by Eric Baer at Case Western Reserve University and in 1988 at the University of Akron."}

This happens by physical and chemical manipulations. Often, several different chemical reactions are used; one after another. In modern laboratory usage, a chemical synthesis is reproducible (if the experiment is done a second time, it will have the same results as the first time), reliable (not broken by small changes in conditions), and established to work in multiple laboratories.\nChemists start to design a chemical synthesis by selecting compounds to combine. These starting chemicals are known as reagents or reactants. Chemists do various things to these reagents to synthesize the product, or an intermediate product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel. The vessel can be a chemical reactor or a simple flask. Many reactions require some form of work-up procedure before the final product is isolated.\nThe amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield. Typically, chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced. A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that reduces the yield of the wanted product.\nThe chemist Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe was the first to use the word \"synthesis\" in its present-day meaning.\nStrategies.\nIn most cases, a single reaction will not convert a reactant (starting chemical) into the desired reaction product. Chemists have many strategies to find the best sequence of reactions to make the desired product. In cascade reactions multiple chemical changes take place within a single reactant. In multi-component reactions up to 11 different reactants form a single reaction product. In a telescopic synthesis, one reactant goes through multiple transformations without isolating intermediates after each step.\nOrganic synthesis.\nOrganic synthesis is a special type of chemical synthesis. Only organic compounds are created in organic synthesis. The total synthesis of a complex product may take many steps to reach the goal product. These steps can take too much time. Chemists want to have skill in organic synthesis and being able to find a synthesis path with the least number of steps. The synthesis of very valuable or difficult compounds has earned chemists, such as Robert Burns Woodward, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nIf a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds and yields something new, it is a \"purely synthetic process\". If it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to a new compounds, the synthesis is called a \"semisynthetic process\".\nOther meanings.\nMost times, chemical synthesis means the overall, many step procedure for making a desired product. Sometimes, chemists use \"chemical synthesis\" to mean just a \"direct combination reaction\". In a direct combination reaction, two or more reactants combine to form a single product. The chemical equation for a direct combination reaction is:\nwhere A and B are elements or compounds, and AB is a compound consisting of A and B. Examples of combination reactions include:\nFour special synthesis rules are:"}

It builds organic compounds using organic reactions. Organic molecules can have a higher level of complexity compared to inorganic compounds. So, the synthesis of organic compounds has developed into one of the most important parts of organic chemistry. There are two main areas of research fields within the general area of organic synthesis: \"total synthesis\" and \"methodology\".\nTotal synthesis.\nA total synthesis is the complete chemical synthesis of complex organic molecules from simple, commercially available (petrochemical) or natural precursors. In a \"linear\" synthesis\u2014often used for simple structures\u2014several steps are performed one after another until the molecule is complete. The chemical compounds made in each step are usually called \"synthetic intermediates\". For more complex molecules, a different approach may be preferable: convergent synthesis involves the individual preparation of several \"pieces\" (key intermediates), which are then combined to form the goal product.\nRobert Burns Woodward, who received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for several total syntheses (for example, his 1954 synthesis of strychnine), is regarded as the father of modern organic synthesis. Some latter-day examples of total synthesis include Wender's, Holton's, Nicolaou's and Danishefsky's synthesis of Taxol.\nMethodology and applications.\nEach step of a synthesis involves a chemical reaction, and reagents and conditions for each of these reactions need to be designed to give a good yield and a pure product, with as little work as possible. A method may already exist in the literature for making one of the early synthetic intermediates, and this method will usually be used rather than \"trying to reinvent the wheel\". However most intermediates are compounds that have never been made before. These will normally be made using general methods developed by methodology researchers. To be useful, these methods need to give high yields. They must also be reliable for a broad range of substrates. For practical applications, additional requirements include industrial standards of safety and purity. Methodology research usually involves three main stages: \"discovery\", \"optimization\", and studies of \"scope and limitations\". The \"discovery\" requires extensive knowledge of and experience with chemical reactivities of appropriate reagents. \"Optimization\" is where one or two starting compounds are tested in the reaction under a wide variety of conditions of temperature, solvent, reaction time, etc. Researchers try different conditions until they find the best conditions for product yield and purity. Finally, researchers try to extend the synthesis method to a broad range of different starting materials, to find its scope and limitations. Total synthesis (see above) are sometimes used to highlight the new method and demonstrate its value in a real-world application. Major industries focused especially on polymers (and plastics) and on pharmaceuticals have used this research.\nAsymmetric synthesis.\nMost complex natural products are chiral. Each enantiomer can have a different bioactivity. Traditional total syntheses targeted racemic mixtures, i.e., as an equal mixture of both possible enantiomers. The racemic mixture might then be separated via chiral resolution.\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, chemists began to develop methods of asymmetric catalysis and kinetic resolution. These reactions could be directed to produce only one enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. Early examples include Sharpless epoxidation (K. Barry Sharpless) and asymmetric hydrogenation (William S. Knowles and Ry\u014dji Noyori). For their achievement, these workers went on to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. Such reactions gave chemists a much wider choice of enantiomerically pure molecules to start an organic synthesis. Previously only natural enantiomer starting materials could be used. Using techniques pioneered by Robert Burns Woodward and other new synthetic methods, chemists became more able to make complex molecules without unwanted racemisation. This is called stereocontrol. This allowed the final target molecule to be synthesised as one pure enantiomer without any resolution being necessary. Such techniques are referred to as asymmetric synthesis.\nSynthesis design.\nElias James Corey brought a more formal approach to synthesis design, based on retrosynthetic analysis, for which he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1990. In this approach, the research is planned backwards from the product, using standard rules. The steps are shown using retrosynthetic arrows (drawn as: =&gt;), which in effect means \"is made from\". Computer programs have been written for designing a synthesis based on sequences of generic \"half-reactions\"."}

The solvent used is usually tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene). The solvent is called \"perc\" in the industry and \"dry-cleaning fluid\" by the public. It is often used instead of hand washing delicate fabrics. People use dry cleaning because it takes less work than hand washing.\nHistory.\nThe ancient Romans used a chemical called ammonia (derived from urine) and fuller's earth (a clay that can absorb grease and oil.) to clean their woolen togas. \"Fullonicae\" were very famous, with at least one in every town of any notability, and frequently the largest employer in a district. These laundries got their urine from farm animals, or from special pots situated at public bathrooms. The workforce made so much money that fuller's guilds (a group that works in solely one job, in this case, making fuller's earth, this special clay.) were an important political force. Also, the government taxed the collection of urine and sent people to jail for wetting their pants.\nModern dry cleaning uses solvents that do not use water to remove dirt and stains from clothing. Jean Baptiste Jolly discovered that petroleum-based solvents (chemicals based on fuel like gasoline or kerosene.) can be used for dry-cleaning in the mid-19th century. Jolly was a French dye-works owner. He noticed that his tablecloth became cleaner after his maid spilled kerosene on it. Because of this, he developed a service cleaning people's clothes this way, which became known as \"nettoyage \u00e0 sec,\" or \"dry cleaning\".\nEarly dry cleaners used petroleum-based solvents, such as gasoline (petrol) and kerosene. Fire concerns led William Joseph Stoddard, a dry cleaner from Atlanta, to develop Stoddard solvent as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents. The government started to control dry cleaners because the highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions.\nAfter World War I, dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents. These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power. By the mid-1930s, the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), widely called \"perc,\" as the best solvent. It has excellent cleaning power and is stable, nonflammable, and gentle to most clothing. However, perc was also the first chemical to be classified as a carcinogen (a chemical that can cause cancer.) by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (a classification later withdrawn). In 1993, the California Air Resources Board adopted regulations to reduce perc emissions from dry cleaning operations. The dry cleaning industry is in the process of replacing perc with other chemicals and/or methods.\nTraditionally, the actual cleaning process was carried out at centralized \"factories\"; high street cleaners shops received garments from customers, sent them to the factory, and then had them returned to the shop, where the customer could collect them. This was due mainly to the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process. At this time, dry-cleaning was carried out in two different machines \u2014 one for the cleaning process itself and the second to dry the clothing.\nMachines of this era were called \"vented\"; their fumes and drying exhausts were sent into the air, in the same way as with modern tumble dryer exhausts. This added to environmental contamination. Also much potentially reusable perc was lost to the atmosphere. Much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed. No solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere. In enclosed machines, solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled. So, it can be reused to clean further loads, or safely thrown away. The majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor, which automatically feels when most traces of perc have been removed from the load during the drying process. This system ensures that only the smallest amount of perc fumes will be released when opening the door at the end of the cycle.\nProcess.\nA dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine, and clothes dryer. Garments are placed into a washing/extraction chamber (referred to as the basket, or drum). The chamber is the core of the machine. The washing chamber contains a horizontal, perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell. The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the clothing. The basket can hold between about 10 and 40\u00a0kg (20 to 80\u00a0lb).\nDuring the wash cycle, the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate, agitating the clothing. The solvent temperature is maintained at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), as a higher temperature may damage it. During the wash cycle, the solvent in the chamber is filtered and then fed back into the chamber. This is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration. The solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit that has both a boiler and condenser. The condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent' tank. The ideal flow rate is one gallon of solvent per pound of garments (roughly 8 litres of solvent per kilogram of clothing) per minute, depending on the size of the machine.\nOperators also check clothing for foreign objects before placing them into the machine. Items such as plastic pens will dissolve in the solvent bath and may damage textiles beyond recovery. Some textile dyes are \"loose\" (red being the main problem), and will release dye during solvent immersion. Operators will dry clean red clothing separately from lighter-color textiles to avoid color transfer. The solvent used must be distilled to remove impurities that may transfer to clothing. Operators checked clothing for dry-cleaning compatibility, including fasteners. Many fasteners that decorate clothing either are not dry cleaning solvent proof or will not withstand the mechanical action of cleaning. Operators will remove them and restitched them after the cleaning. Or, operators will wrap them in a small padded protector. Fragile items, such as feather bedspreads or tasseled rugs or hangings, may be enclosed in a loose mesh bag. The density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm\u00b3 at room temperature (70% heavier than water), and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support.\nMany people believe that all marks or stains can be removed by dry cleaning. Not every stain can be cleaned just by dry cleaning. Some need to be treated with spotting solvents; sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain remover liquids before garments are washed or dry cleaned. Also, garments stored in soiled condition for a long time are difficult to bring back to their original color and texture. Natural fibers such as wool, cotton, and silk of lighter colors should not be left in dirty or soiled condition for long amounts of time as they absorb dirt in their texture and are unlikely to be restored to their original color and finish.\nThe main reason that washing in water has a different result than dry cleaning is that water is a polar solvent while dry cleaning uses a non-polar solvent.\nA typical wash cycle lasts for 8\u201315 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling. During the first three minutes, solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose, insoluble soil comes off. It takes approximately ten to twelve minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground-in insoluble soil from garments. Machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25 minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent-soluble soils. A dry-cleaning surfactant \"soap\" may also be added.\nAt the end of the wash cycle, the machine starts a rinse cycle wherein the garment load is rinsed with fresh distilled solvent from the pure solvent tank. This pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the \"dirty\" working solvent.\nAfter the rinse cycle, the machine begins the extraction process, which recovers dry-cleaning solvent for reuse. Modern machines recover approximately 99.99% of the solvent that was used. The extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350 to 450 rpm, causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric. Until this time the cleaning is done in normal temperature, the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process. When no more solvent can be spun out, the machine starts the drying cycle.\nDuring the drying cycle, the garments are tumbled in a stream of warm air (60-63\u00b0C/140-145\u00b0F) that circulates through the basket, evaporating any traces of solvent left after the spin cycle. The air temperature is controlled to prevent heat damage to the garments. The exhausted warm air from the machine then passes through a chiller unit where solvent vapors are condensed and returned to the distilled solvent tank. Modern dry cleaning machines use a closed-loop system in which the chilled air is reheated and recirculated. This results in high solvent recovery rates and reduced air pollution. In the early days of dry cleaning, large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless.\nAfter the drying cycle is complete, a deodorizing (aeration) cycle cools the garments and removes even more of the solvent, by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins. After the aeration cycle, the garments are clean and ready for pressing/finishing.\nIn fact, dry cleaning does not remove all of the solvent. There are no government standards for how much solvent is allowed to remain in the fabric. Detectable amounts of the solvent remain in clothes, with wool clothes retaining the most solvent.\nSolvent processing.\nWorking solvent from the washing chamber passes through several filtration steps before it is returned to the washing chamber. The first step is a button trap, which prevents small objects such as lint, fasteners, buttons, and coins from entering the solvent pump.\nOver time, a thin layer of filter cake (called muck) accumulates on the lint filter. The muck is removed regularly (commonly once per day) and then processed to recover solvent trapped in the muck. Many machines use \"spin disc filters,\" which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent.\nAfter the lint filter, the solvent passes through an absorptive cartridge filter. This filter is made from activated clays and charcoal and removes fine insoluble soil and non-volatile residues, along with dyes from the solvent. Finally, the solvent passes through a polishing filter, which removes any soil not previously removed. The clean solvent is then returned to the working solvent tank.\nTo enhance cleaning power, small amounts of detergent (0.5%-1.5%) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality. These detergents help dissolve hydrophilic soils and keep soil from redepositing on garments. Depending on the machine's design, either an anionic or a cationic detergent is used.\nSince the solvent recovery is less than 100%, and because dry-cleaning does not remove water-based stains well, entrepreneurs have developed the wet cleaning process, which is, in essence, cold-water washing and air drying, using a computer-controlled washer and dryer. In general, wet cleaning is still being improved and developed, although low-tech versions of it have been used for centuries.\nSymbols.\nPeople who make clothes have special symbols to say how they should be cleaned. The international GINETEX laundry symbol for dry cleaning is a circle. It may have a letter P inside to indicate perchloroethylene solvent, or a letter F inside to indicate a hydrocarbon solvent. A bar underneath the circle means that only mild cleaning processes should be used. A crossed-out empty circle means the clothes should not be dry cleaned.\nDry-cleaning wastes.\nCooked muck.\nCooked Powder Residue \u2014 the waste material generated by cooking down or distilling muck. Cooked powder residue is a hazardous waste and will contain solvent, powdered filter material (diatomite), carbon, non-volatile residues, lint, dyes, grease, soils, and water. Laws say how this material can be discarded.\nSludge.\nThe waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent, water, soils, carbon, and other non-volatile residues. Material removed from the bottom of the stills at chlorinated solvent dry cleaning operations are hazardous wastes.\nEnvironment.\nPerc is classified as a hazardous air contaminant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and must be handled as a hazardous waste. To prevent it from getting into drinking water, dry cleaners that use perc must take special precautions against site contamination. Landlords are becoming increasingly reluctant to allow dry cleaners to operate in their buildings. When released into the air, perc can contribute to smog when it reacts with other volatile organic carbon substances. California declared perchloroethylene a toxic chemical in 1991, and its use will become illegal in that state in 2023.\nSome alternatives such as CO2 avoids the toxic risks of perc. But, CO2 does not clean some forms of grime as well as perc.\nHome dry cleaning.\nVarious commercial products on the marketplace today, such as Procter &amp; Gamble's Dryel, allow elements of the dry cleaning process to be performed in the household using home laundry machines. Though not the complete process that would be performed by a professional dry cleaner, they allow the convenience of home laundry and work for certain types of garments."}

Their terrestrial origins are indicated by:\nThe question of how land animals evolved into ocean-going leviathans was a mystery until recent discoveries in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea.\nDNA sequence analysis.\nAfter many years when palaeontologists thought whales had evolved from mesonychids, DNA sequence analysis showed the closest relationship was with artiodactyls, the even-toed ungulates. A new clade was created to include Cetacea and their nearest relatives, the hippopotamus family. This clade is called the Cetartiodactyla.\nFossil record.\nHippo fossils are not found until the Miocene, but whale ancestors have been found from the Eocene. This leaves a gap of nearly 30 million years where no hippo ancestors are found. The most recent hypothesis is that hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor which branched off from other Artiodactyls around 60 million years ago (mya). This ancestral group probably split into two branches around 54 mya. One branch evolved into cetaceans, possibly beginning with the proto-whale \"Pakicetus\" from 52 mya. These early cetaceans gradually became adapted to life in the sea. They became the completely aquatic cetaceans. \n\"Indohyus\".\n\"Indohyus\" is a small deer-like creature, which lived about 48 million years ago in Kashmir. It belongs to the artiodactyls family \"Raoellidae\", and is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea. \nAbout the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this herbivorous creature shared some of the traits of whales. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including a thick and heavy outer bone coating. This is similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus, and reduces buoyancy so that they can stay underwater. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or water chevrotain which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.\nSize.\nScientists from the University of Plymouth studied many animals that dive and hold their breath, from insects to whales, and they found that larger animals can hold their breath longer than smaller animals because they can store more oxygen for their size, and this difference was much bigger for warm-blooded animals than for cold-blooded animals. They said this may be why modern whales and extinct diving animals like plesiosaurs became so large."}

They generally have a round shape. Coal balls are not made of coal, even though they have the name \"coal ball\".\nIn 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, found coal balls in England. Because of that, the initial research on coal balls was done in Europe. Coal balls were found and identified in North America in 1922. Since then, coal balls have been found in other countries and several theories on their formation have been proposed.\nMarie Stopes and D.M.S. Watson also examined coal ball samples. They agreed that coal balls formed \"in situ\". They also added that interaction with a marine environment was necessary for a coal ball to form.\nCoal balls are in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are in more places than in Europe. The oldest coal balls were found in Germany and former Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson found signs of marine animal remains in North American coal balls.\nThe quality of the preservation of organic material depends on the speed of the burial process and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure have a higher preservation degree. However, plant remains in most coal balls show various signs of decay and collapse.\nAnalysis.\nThin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The ball was cut into thin sections with a diamond saw. Then it was flattened and polished with an abrasive. Then it was examined under a microscope. This is the procedure which was carried out by Hooker and Binney. The time needed, and the poor quality of samples produced, led to a more convenient method.\nThe new method, first used in 1928, is called the \"liquid peel technique\"."}

He worked in the field of polymers, or macromolecules. He was a leading pioneer in understanding how polymers dissolve in solutions. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 \"for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHe graduated from Elgin High School in Elgin, Illinois in 1927. Flory received a bachelor's degree from Manchester College (Indiana) in 1931 and a Ph.D. from the Ohio State University in 1934. His first position was at DuPont with Wallace Carothers.\nPolymer science.\nFlory's earliest work in polymer science was in the area of polymerization kinetics at the DuPont Experimental station. Most chemists studying condensation polymerization believed that the reactivity of the end group decreased as the macromolecule grew. Flory argued that the reactivity was independent of the polymer's size. He showed that the number of polymer chains present decreased with size exponentially.\nFlory introduced the important concept of chain transfer to the study of addition polymerization. This improved chemists' understanding of the kinetic equations. It also helped chemists to understand the distribution of the polymer sizes.\nIn 1938, after Carothers' death, Flory moved to the Basic Science Research Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati. There he developed a mathematical theory for the polymerization of compounds with more than two functional groups. He also developed the theory of polymer networks or gels.\nIn 1940, he joined the Linden, NJ laboratory of the Standard Oil Development Company. He developed a statistical mechanical theory for polymer mixtures there.\nIn 1943, he left to join the research laboratories of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as head of a group on polymer fundamentals. In the Spring of 1948 Peter Debye, then chairman of the chemistry department at Cornell University, invited Flory to give the annual Baker Lectures. He then was offered a position with the faculty in the Fall of the same year. At Cornell, Flory expanded and refined his Baker Lectures into his best work (magnum opus), \"Principles of Polymer Chemistry\" which was published in 1953 by Cornell University Press. This quickly became a standard text for all workers in the field of polymers, and is still widely used to this day.\nFlory introduced the concept of excluded volume to polymers. (Werner Kuhn had already invented the term in 1934 for molecules in general.) \"Excluded volume\" refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule. Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume. The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough. Excluded volume explained several puzzling experimental results of that time. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics \u2013 the long-range interactions coming from the excluded volume are eliminated. This allows experimenters to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near-neighboring groups. Flory taught another advantage of performing the experiment at the theta point: the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution. This works because excluded volume interactions are neutralized at the theta point.\nHe also invented an original method for computing the probable size of a polymer in good solution. He invented the Flory-Huggins Solution Theory. He derived the Flory exponent, which helps characterize the movement of polymers in solution.\nFlory won the Perkin Medal and the Priestley Medal.\nThe Flory convention.\nIn modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. A three-dimensional structure can be described using the Flory convention by applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates.\nLater years.\nHe became a professor at Stanford University in 1961. He became the Jackson-Wood Professor there in 1966. He retired from Stanford in 1975. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 \"for his fundamental achievements, both theoretical and experimental, in the physical chemistry of macromolecules.\" He remained active after his retirement, and consulted for IBM for some years. He and his wife Emily Catherine Tabor (now dead) had three children, Susan, Melinda and John. Susan has two children, Elizabeth and Mary. Elizabeth has three children, Katy Greer, Margaret Greer, and Sam Greer. Paul J Flory died of a heart attack in Big Sur, California in 1985."}

Produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance, the movie is considered to be one of Disney's darkest animated movie because its narrative explores such mature themes as infanticide, lust, damnation, genocide, and sin, despite the changes made from the original source material in order to ensure a G rating received by the MPAA. The musical score was written by Alan Menken, with songs written by Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had previously collaborated on \"Pocahontas\".\nThe movie was released on June 21, 1996 to largely positive reviews and was a commercial success, grossing over $325 million worldwide and becoming the fifth highest-grossing release of 1996.

Undeterred, Quasimodo attends the festival where he is celebrated for his deformities, but is humiliated and surrounded by everyone. After freeing Quasimodo, the kind Gypsy dancer Esmeralda uses witchcraft to evade capture.\nAs Quasimodo returns to the cathedral, Esmeralda meets Phoebus, the captain of the guard, who has her confined, instead of arresting her. Esmeralda befriends Quasimodo. He helps her escape the cathedral, and she gives him a pendant with a map to the Court of Miracles, the home of the gypsies. Frollo develops lustful feelings towards Esmeralda, calling on the Virgin Mary to protect him from her spell and avoid eternal damnation. The next day, Frollo and the guards arrest one of the civilians and burn every buildings. Phoebus defies Frollo, when he attempts to burn down the house. Phoebus falls unconscious at the river Seine, but Esmeralda rescues him and they head to the cathedral for refuge. The gargoyles try to encourage Quasimodo, but he becomes heartbroken when Esmeralda has loved Phoebus. When Frollo returns to the cathedral, he bluffs to Quasimodo that he knows the location of the gypsy hideout and Frollo will attack at dawn with a thousand men. Using Esmeralda's map, Quasimodo and Phoebus travel to the Court of Miracles, where Frollo and the guards capture everyone.\nFrollo prepares to burn Esmeralda at the stake after she rejects him, but she is saved by Quasimodo and is brought into the cathedral. Phoebus releases himself and the gypsies, and unites the citizens of Paris while opposing Frollo and the guards. Quasimodo and the gargoyles pour molten lead into the streets to prevent everyone from entering the cathedral. Frollo sneaks inside, and pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda onto the balcony, where he reveals to Quasimodo that he killed his mother. Frollo falls to his death into the lake of molten copper, while Phoebus saves Quasimodo. Esmeralda and Phoebus receive a blessing for their relationship, and Quasimodo is accepted into Parisian society."}

In the year 1909, James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process, in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and adsorption. \nExamples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment; using sorption it is possible to bind pollutants to small particles in the air (called aerosols), or in the soil (where they bind to colloids). Sorption makes these bindings possible. In much the same way, polluants can be transported over long distances. \nMachines and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning."}

It uses applied physics and chemistry. Supersmall nanotechnology has got attention in recent years. There are many inventions of new material. Work on why structures fail or break down is very important to engineering.\nHistory.\nThe important material of a given era is often its defining point. Examples are the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.\nMaterials science originally studied ceramics and metallurgy. These ancient crafts make materials science one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs showed that the physical properties of a material were related to its atomic structure. As the phases changed, so did the physical properties of the material.\nImportant elements of modern materials science are a product of the space race: the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials, used in the construction of space exploration vehicles.\nMaterials science is now linked to the development of plastics, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, magnetic materials, medical implant materials and biological materials.\nThe material scientist/engineer also deals with the extraction of materials and their conversion into useful forms. So, ingot casting, foundry techniques, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a metallurgist/engineer. Often the presence, absence or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will have a great impact on the final properties of the materials produced, for instance, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extraction and purification techniques employed in the extraction of iron in the blast furnace will have an impact of the quality of steel that may be produced.\nCause of failures.\nThe study of disasters in the 19th and 20th century led to some important discoveries. A.A. Griffith (1893\u20131963) discovered that real materials never get near their theoretical strength. This was a groundbreaking discovery which led to changes in many industries. As an example, steel gets almost 1/10th of its theoretical strength, but most solids are 100 to 1000 times weaker than expected.\nGriffith's insights were developed further by J.E. Gordon (1913\u20131998). Gordon said that all simple solids are by their nature brittle. Toughness \u2013 resistance to fracture \u2013 has to be designed into materials. The usual way is to add other material to the pure substance. This makes its structure more complex, and that makes it less likely to fail. A good example is bulletproof glass, where a plastic layer stuck to glass make it many times stronger than either material would be separately. The personal armour based on Kevlar is another example. Biological materials have this feature naturally. Bones do bend a little before they reach breaking point, and tree trunks also have some \"give\".\nMetal alloys.\nThe industrial study of metal alloys is a large part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels. An iron carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present. Increasing carbon levels leads to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties however. Cast Iron is defined as an Iron-Carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of chromium. Nickel and molybdenum are also found in stainless steels.\nOther significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and magnesium. Copper alloys have been known for a long time (since the Bronze Age), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.\nPolymers.\nPolymers are also an important part of materials science. They are the raw materials used to make what we commonly call plastics. Plastics are really the final product. They are made when polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing. The mixture is then shaped into a final form. Common polymers are, include polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates.\nPVC (polyvinyl-chloride) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to an incredible array of uses, from artificial leather to electrical insulation and cabling, packaging and containers. It is simple to make. It accepts a wide range of plasticisers and other additives, which give it differing properties.\nCeramics and glasses.\nAnother application of the material sciences is the structures of glass and ceramics, typically associated with the most brittle materials. Ceramics and glasses use covalent bonds and ionic-covalent bonds with SiO2, silica or sand, as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay and as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. Glass forms into an amorphous structure when it is cooled. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics.\nEngineering ceramics are known for their stiffness, high temperature, and stability under compression and electrical stress. Alumina, silica carbide, and tungsten carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.\nComposite materials.\nAnother application of material science in industry is the making of composite materials. Composite materials are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermally insulative tiles which play a key and integral role in National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Shuttle thermal protection system which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC), The light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1510\u00a0\u00b0C (2750\u00a0\u00b0F) and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured/pyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. In order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide.\nOther examples can be seen in the \"plastic\" casings of television sets, cell-phones and similar objects. These plastic casings are usually a composite material. It is a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) in which calcium carbonate chalk, talc, glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for added strength, bulk, or electro-static dispersion. These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.\nNew magnetic material.\nA new magnetic material has been discovered. It could transform computer hard drives and energy storage devices.\nA highly sensitive metal bilayer needs only a small shift in temperature to dramatically alter its magnetism. This is a very useful property in electronic engineering. \"No other material known to man can do this. It's a huge effect. And we can engineer it\", said Ivan Schuller, of the University of California, San Diego.\nThe material combines thin layers of nickel and vanadium oxide. This is a structure which is surprisingly responsive to heat. \"We can control the magnetism in just a narrow range of temperature without applying a magnetic field. And in principle we could also control it with voltage or current\", said Prof Schuller.\nClasses of materials.\nMaterials science encompasses various classes of materials, each of which may constitute a separate field. Materials are sometimes classified by the type of bonding present between the atoms:"}

It is downstream of central London. Its purpose is to prevent London from being flooded by exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the North Sea. It is raised (closed) only during high tide; at ebb tide it is lowered to release the water which backs up behind it.\nThe barrier's northern bank is in the London Borough of Newham and its southern bank is in the London Borough of Greenwich. The report of Hermann Bondi into the North Sea flood of 1953 affecting parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London was what led to the building of the barrier.\nGeography.\nGeographical weather system.\nLondon is vulnerable to flooding. A storm surge generated by low pressure in the Atlantic Ocean sometimes tracks eastwards past the north of Scotland and may then be driven into the shallow waters of the North Sea. The surge tide is funnelled down the North Sea which narrows towards the English Channel and the Thames Estuary. If the storm surge coincides with a spring tide, dangerously high water levels can occur in the Thames Estuary. This situation combined with downstream flows in the Thames tells engineers when to operate the barriers.\nRising water levels.\nThe threat has increased over time due to the slow but continuous rise in high water level over the centuries (20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0inches) / 100 years) and the slow \"tilting\" of Britain (up in the north and west, and down in the south and east) caused by post-glacial rebound.\nHistorical flooding.\nFourteen people died in the 1928 Thames flood, and after 307 people died in the UK in the North Sea Flood of 1953 the issue gained new prominence.\nEarly proposals for a flood control system were stymied by the need for a large opening in the barrier to allow for vessels from London Docks to pass through. When containerization replaced older forms of shipping and a new port was opened at Tilbury, a smaller barrier became feasible with each of the four main navigation spans being the same width as the opening of Tower Bridge.\nOperation.\nA Thames Barrier flood defence closure is triggered when high tides are forecast in the North Sea \"and\" river flows are high at the tidal limit at Teddington weir. If water levels might exceed in central London, that is the trigger.\nClosure begins about 9 hours before a dangerous high tide reaches the barrier. Messages give orders to stop river traffic, close subsidiary gates and alert other river users. As well as the Thames Barrier, the smaller gates along the Thames Tideway must be closed. Once river navigation has been stopped and all gates closed, then the Thames Barrier itself can be closed. The smaller gates are closed first, then the main navigable spans in succession. The gates remain closed until the tide downstream of the barrier falls to the same level as the water level upstream.\nAfter heavy rain west of London, floodwater flows down the Thames upstream (before London). Because the river is tidal from Teddington weir all the way through London, \"this is only a problem at high tide\", which prevents the floodwater from escaping out to sea. From Teddington the river is opening out into its estuary, and at low tide it can take much greater flow rates the further one goes downstream. \nWhen the river is in flood upstream, if the gates are closed shortly after low tide, a huge empty volume holds behind the barrier which can act as a reservoir to hold the floodwater coming over Teddington weir. Most river floods will not fill this volume in the few high tide hours when the barrier needs to be closed. If the barrier was not there, the high tide would fill up this volume instead, and the floodwater could then spill over the river banks in London. About a third of the closures up to 2009 were to prevent flooding caused by heavy rain to the west of London.\nClosures and incidents.\nIn the 1980s there were four closures, 35 closures in the 1990s, and 75 closures in the first decade of this century. The rate of closures is above that predicted, and is increasing rapidly.\nAn incident that was potentially catastrophic for London occurred on 27 October 1997. The dredger, MV \"Sand Kite\", sailing in thick fog, collided with one of the Thames Barrier's piers. As the ship started to sink she dumped her 3,300 tonne load of aggregate, finally sinking by the bow on top of one of the barrier's gates where she lay for several days. Initially the gate could not be closed as it was covered in a thick layer of gravel. A longer term problem was the premature loss of paint on the flat side of the gate caused by abrasion. One estimate of the cost of flooding damage, had it occurred, was around \u00a313 billion. The vessel was refloated in mid-November 1997.\nThe barrier was closed twice on 9 November 2007 after a storm surge in the North Sea which was compared to the one in 1953. The main danger of flooding from the surge was on the coast above the Thames Barrier, where evacuations took place, but the winds abated a little and, at the Thames Barrier, the 9 November 2007 storm surge did not completely coincide with high tide.\nFuture.\nThe barrier was originally designed to protect London against a big flood level. The defence level included long-term changes in sea and land levels as understood at that time (~1970). Despite global warming, and a higher predicted rate of sea level rise, recent analysis suggested the barrier could last until around 2060\u20132070.\nReleased in 2005, a study by four respected academics contained a proposal to replace the Thames Barrier with a more ambitious 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) long barrier across the Thames Estuary from Sheerness in Kent to Southend in Essex."}

Environmental chemistry can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air, soil, and water environments; and the effect of human activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric, aquatic and soil chemistry, as well as uses analytical chemistry. It is related to environmental and other areas of science. It is different from green chemistry, which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source.\nEnvironmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works. It identifies the chemicals that are present naturally. It studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals. Then, it accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals.\nEnvironmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the environment. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations, solutions, units, sampling, and analytical techniques. Chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromones.\nContamination.\nA contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than typical levels or that would not otherwise be there. This may be due to human activity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with \"pollutant\", which is a substance that hurts the surrounding environment. While a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date.\nThe \"medium\" (for example, soil) or organism (for example, fish) affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a \"receptor\". A \"sink\" is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant.\nEnvironmental indicators.\nChemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, nutrients nitrates and phosphorus, heavy metals (including copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury), and pesticides.\nApplications.\nEnvironmental chemistry is used by the Environment Agency (in England and Wales), the Environmental Protection Agency (in the United States) the Association of Public Analysts, and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include:\nMethods.\nQuantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies.\nCommon analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as gravimetric, titrimetric and electrochemical methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry: Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission (ICP-AES) or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Non-MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools.\nOther parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals. These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. Bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms.\nPublished analytical methods.\nPeer-reviewed test methods have been published by government agencies\n and private research organizations. Approved published methods must be used when testing to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements."}

The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. The movie was directed by Jim Gillespie. It stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell and Ryan Phillippe. The writer is Kevin Williamson (the writer of \"Scream\"). It was followed by two sequels: \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" and \"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer\".\nPlot.\nOn the Fourth of July 1996 in Southport, North Carolina, high school graduates Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray and George Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard) Charlotte Wilson (Neve Campbell), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), and Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) drive to the beach after a night of partying. While driving along a coastal byway, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max (Johnny Galecki) passes by them on the road. Julie reassures Max that everything is all right, and he leaves. After some arguing, the group decides to dispose of the body, dumping it in the water. They agree to never again discuss what had happened.\nA year later, Julie returns home from her college in Boston for the summer. Since the incident, the friends have gone their separate ways. Julie receives a letter with no return address, stating, \"I know what you did last summer!\" Disturbed, Julie tracks down Helen, who has returned to Southport to work at her family's department store after a failed attempt at an acting career in New York City. The girls take the note to Barry, who immediately suspects Max. They confront Max on the docks, and Barry threatens him with a hook. Julie meets Ray, who is now working as a fisherman; he unsuccessfully tries to reconcile with her. Julie meets up with George, who is now working as a host for a children's TV show, she showed the letter to George, then Julie and George meet up with Charlotte, who now works at a video store. She reconciles with George and Julie. Later, Max is killed by a figure in a rain slicker wielding a hook. Barry discovers a note in his gym locker saying, \"I know.\" He is then ambushed by the same assailant driving Barry's car.\nMeanwhile, Julie, Charlotte and George researches newspaper articles which lead them to believe the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen, George, Charlotte and Julie go to visit with David's sister Missy (Anne Heche) at her home. Missy explains to them that their family was devastated by David's death; she also mentions that a friend of David's named Billy Blue also visited her to pay his last respects. Later that night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house, cuts off her hair while she sleeps, and writes \"Soon\" in lipstick on her vanity mirror.\nThe following morning, Julie, Charlotte and George find Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket in the trunk of their car. When Julie calls the others, the body is missing. Julie, Charlotte, George, Helen, and Barry confront Ray about the recent events. Ray claims to have received a threatening letter as well. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen go to participate in the Fourth of July parade. Missy reveals David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend Susie in a car accident and shows David's suicide note to Julie and George. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie and George realise it was not a suicide note, but a death threat.\nAt the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry and Charlotte being murdered on the balcony. She rushes upstairs with a police officer but finds no sign of the killer or Barry or Charlotte. A police officer escorts Helen home, but the killer lures him into an alley and murders him. Helen flees to her nearby family store, where her sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson) is closing for the night. The killer enters the store and murders Elsa. Helen is chased to the third floor of the building and escapes through a window, falling to a long alleyway. She manages to run toward the street, but the killer stops her and slashes her to death, her screams being drowned out by the sound of the oncoming parade.\nJulie and George find an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis (Muse Watson), and realise that Ben was the man they ran over, moments after he had killed David to avenge his daughter. She and George then go to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe them. Julie and George notice Ray's boat is called Billy Blue and run away. Ben appears, knocking Ray unconscious, and invites both Julie and George to hide on his boat. On the boat, they find photos and articles about their friends and them, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, and he begins tormenting Julie and George, chasing them below deck; there, they uncover the bodies of Helen, Charlotte and Barry in the boat's ice box. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie and George. He ultimately uses the rigging to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When the police question them, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anybody the previous summer, and reconcile.\nA year later, both Julie and George are in college in Boston. As Julie enters the shower, she notices the words \"I still know\" on the mirror. Moments later, a dark figure crashes through it as Julie screams in horror."}

It is formed by the junction of the Vakhsh and Panj. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between Iran and Turan.\nNames.\nIn antiquity, the river was known as \"Vaksu\" to Indo-Aryans.\nIn ancient Afghanistan, the river was also called \"Gozan\", descriptions of which can be found in the book \"The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch By George Passman Tate\".\nIn classical antiquity, the river was known as the \"\u014cxus\" in Latin and \u1f6e\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 \"Oxos\" in Greek.\nThe name \"Amu\" is said to have come from the medieval city of \"\u0100mul\", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as \"T\u00fcrkmenabat\"), in modern Turkmenistan. \"Darya\" is the Persian word for \"river\".\nAmu Darya is a river almost in reverse. It gets its water from a powerful glacier fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of Afghanistan's \"Wakhan Corridor\", and does not end at the sea but spreads out into the sands of Turkmenistan's\" Kyzyl Kum\" desert instead of the inland Aral Sea as it did in former times.\nIn hadith.\nIn the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (hadith), the river is called by the name Jayhan (Arabic form of its ancient name Gozan).\nAs the river Jayhan.\nHistorians tell us that one of the most ancient names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Jayhan. A name used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish and Afghanastan historians. .\nDescription.\nThe river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the Aral Sea - though there is some evidence the large Pamir glaciers provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries A.D.\nHistorical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), the Caspian Sea (from the east) or both, similar to the \"Syr Darya\" (Jaxartes, in Ancient Greek).\nWatershed.\nAbout of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea endorheic basin. This includes most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of Kyrgyzstan, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a long narrow portion of western Turkmenistan and about half of Uzbekistan. About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan.\nOf the area drained by the Amu Darya, only about actively contribute water to the river.\nThis is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the \"Zeravshan River\") have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying desert and steppe.\nThe abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya almost entirely comes from glaciers in the Pamir Mountains and \"Tian Shan\",\nwhich, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably have escaped somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water because it rarely rains in the lowlands that characterize most of the river. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about .\nHistory.\nThe Amu Darya is (also theJayhan river)\nwas called the \"Oxus\" by the ancient Greeks. In ancient times, the river Jayhan was regarded as the boundary between Ir\u0101n and T\u016br\u0101n. The river Jayhan drainage lies in the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the Silk Road ran along part of the Jayhan river northwestward from Termez before going westwards to the Caspian Sea.\nIt is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian.\nPeople began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities.\nThe first British explorer who reached the region was a naval officer called John Wood. He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer Thibaut Vin\u00e9 collected a lot of informations about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862.\nThe Soviet Union became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive cotton fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. The Main Turkmen Canal was a proposed project that would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, but was never built.\nLiterature.\nThe Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, provide a literary background for the 1930s children's book The Far-Distant Oxus."}

She was murdered at age 23 by her friend, an ex-employee of her clothing stores. The movie also describes how Selena started in the music business and her family's problems. Jennifer Lopez starred as Selena, and many music critics believe this movie made Lopez famous. \"Selena\" was produced by Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. (Selena's father), Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz.\nLopez was given $1 million for her role as Selena, making her the highest-paid Hispanic woman ever, at the time. The contained two unreleased songs, two tribute songs and two melodies. It reached number seven on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. It was certified platinum for shipments of one million copies in the United States.bagamash\nNava had a budget of $20 million to make this movie. They filmed the movie in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas. Over 35,000 fans participated in the Houston Astrodome scene. The movie made $15,599,598 on its first week, the number one movie for that week. In total, it made $35,281,794 in 101 days. \"Selena\" had mostly good reviews from critics, though many thought the movie did not tell the true story of Selena. The movie won several ALMA Awards and Imagen Foundation Awards. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, MTV Movie Awards and a Young Artist Award.\nPlot.\nThe movie starts with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) getting ready for her Houston Astrodome concert on February 26, 1995. After her performance, the movie goes back in time to 1961. Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. (Edward James Olmos) and his band Los Dinos are at band practice. After band practice, they went to see a promoter in the other side of town. Los Dinos are then discriminated for being Americans of Mexican heritage. Los Dinos then performed at a Spanish nightclub, and are booed off stage by Mexicans for not knowing any Mexican music. The movie goes forward in time to 1981. Abraham had quit his dreams of becoming a music star and began helping his family. After work, Abraham sat down on his chair and began playing the guitar. His youngest child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) was playing a football game in the backyard. She noticed her father and was curious to know what he was doing. She started to sing in front of Abraham. Abraham was surprised, he started a family band, and named it Selena y Los Dinos. He puts A.B. Quintanilla III (Rafael Tamayo) on base and Suzette Quintanilla (Victoria Elena Flores) on drums. Selena became the singer of the group.\nThe movie is now set in 1989, where Selena is performing at a Houston, Texas festival as an adult. In the next scene, Selena began talking to her cousin (Seidy Lopez) about her dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Suzette (Jackie Guerra) ran upstairs and told them that a rock guitarist is in their kitchen. The three of them began spying to see what's going on. Chris Perez (Jon Seda) began to audition as the band's new guitarist in front of Abraham. Abraham tells A.B. (Jacob Vargas) that he does not like Chris. This is because he is a rocker. However, A.B. tries to tell Abraham that Chris will change his style and look. The next day, Selena asks Chris to eat with her at a pizzeria. In the next scene, Selena's song \"Como La Flor\" reached number one on \"Billboard\" which made the group come together and celebrate. Selena is asked to perform in Mexico where 50,000 fans are waiting on her to sing. Selena came out to perform \"La Carcacha\". However, the crowd became very excited and started pushing people inside of the stage. Selena is later asked by her father to calm down the crowd. She performed a slower version of \"Como La Flor\" and calmed everyone down. After her performance, she and Chris walked on a pier. Selena told him that she was scared for the first time, while Chris tells Selena that he loves her.\nWhile on the bus, Abraham found out that Chris liked Selena. Abraham tells Chris and Selena that their relationship is over. He then fires Chris and orders him to leave. Selena tried to run after him, however, her father told her that if she did that he will disband the group. After this, Selena and Chris began to meet secretly and they eloped. Selena went to her father's house the next day. Abraham began crying and told Selena that he was sorry. He then accepted Chris into the family. In the next scene, Selena won a Grammy Award and opened her clothing stores. She hired Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros) as the manager. Yolanda began to steal money from these places. After this, Selena started recording songs for her crossover album. Abraham later finds out that Yolanda was stealing money, and holds a meeting to hear Yolanda's side. Yolanda tells Abraham that if given time, she will prove her innocence. Later that night, Selena performed \"Si Una Vez\" at the Houston Astrodome on February 26, 1995. After that night, Selena asked her mother to scratch her head and that she and Chris are thinking of starting a family. Selena then dreams of the crossover tour and sings \"Dreaming of You\". After Selena sings the opening of the song, a rose is thrown at her. Selena is seen being rushed to the hospital. Reporters tells everyone that Selena was shot by Sald\u00edvar during an argument over the missing financial records. In the next scene, a doctor walks towards Selena's parents. He tells them that Selena has died. \"Dreaming of You\" is played again, while her fans are seen holding pictures of her during a candlelight vigil. The movie ends with a picture of Selena waving goodbye reading \"April 16, 1971 \u2013 March 31, 1995\".\nCharacters.\nThis is a list of the actors and their roles in \"Selena\":\nProduction and marketing.\nSelena's family wanted to make a movie about Selena's life. They searched Hollywood, California for movie producers. Abraham then contacted Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz. They chose Gregory Nava as the movie director. Abraham told Esparza and Katz that he did not like Nava because of his \"ego\". The two producers told Abraham that everyone in Hollywood had an \"ego problem\". They also told him that Nava was the right guy.\nNava spent one month with the Quintanilla family. He wrote down everything that the family said about Selena. By the fifth week, Nava had written the movie and showed Abraham the draft. Abraham was not happy \u2014 he did not want Selena's fans to think that eloping was a right thing to do. He also did not like the conflict between his character and Chris Perez. Nava responded that the information was \"life events\". He also said that even though he may seem like a \"bad guy\" in the movie, his actions after the marriage would make people see him differently. Abraham agreed and allowed the two stories in the movie. Salma Hayek was originally asked to play the role of Selena in the movie, but she turned it down. She felt that it was \"too early\" to base a movie on Selena and that it would be too emotional since Selena's death was still being covered on television.\nFilming took place in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas from May to October 1996. Nava posted fliers in Texas asking Selena fans to attend the Houston Astrodome scene. News of this event spread throughout the United States and Mexico. Over 35,000 people attended, some coming from as far as Japan and South America. It took over 3 hours to put makeup on everyone who attended. Producing the Astrodome scene cost about $2 million. The budget of the movie was $20 million.\nThe movie's trailer was released worldwide in December 1996. Nava spent $1 million on promotions for \"Selena\".\nMusic.\nThe soundtrack of the movie was released on March 11, 1997 by EMI Latin. The soundtrack included two songs that Selena did not release when she was alive: \"Is It the Beat?\" and \"Where Did the Feeling Go?\". It included two medleys \u2014 \"Disco Medley\" and the \"Cumbia Medley\". They are live versions Selena sang during her Houston Astrodome concert. Two tribute songs were also in the album. \"Viviras Selena\" includes Tejano singers and the Barrio Boyzz. \"One More Time\", which was composed by Olmos is performed by Lil'Ray. The \"Oldies Medley\" was performed by the Vidal Brothers. The soundtrack reached at number seven on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart and number 36 on Canada's \"RPM\". It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album was produced by Selena's brother, Quintanilla III.\nChuck Eddy of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the soundtrack an \"A\" rating and stated that the soundtrack had everything a \"right posthumous\" album should have. Eddy also stated that listening to the album reveals why Selena's death impacted many Americans. Enrique Lopetegui of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"One More Time\" was a \"corny but effective\" tribute to Selena. Lopetegui commented that \"Viviras Selena\" was the \"weakest track\" of the album and that \"Is It the Beat?\" was one of the \"best songs\" of \"Selena\". He believed that \"Where Did the Feeling Go?\" was one of the \"strongest\". Lopetegui also stated that \"Where Did the Feeling Go?\" was similar to \"Vision of Love\" which was recorded by Mariah Carey. Lopetegui compared \"Is It the Beat?\" to the song \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" by Whitney Houston, which had similar beats and sounds. A \"Miami Herald\" writer believed the soundtrack was \"uneven\" and stated that Selena's unreleased recordings \"outshines\" the rest of the songs on the album. A score was released in the summer of 1997 and had music by Dave Grusin.\nRelease and reception.\nBefore the movie was released, Selena fans were not happy that a Puerto Rican would play the part of a Mexican American singer. Many fans changed their views on Lopez after the Houston Astrodome scene was done filming. The movie opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide. \"Selena\" was released on March 21, 1997, and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest debut for that week. It grossed $15,599,598 during its first week and became the number-one movie for that week. The next week, the movie grossed $24,285,142. In total, \"Selena\" grossed $35,281,794. It became the first and only movie directed by Nava to reach the 30 millionth mark. \"Selena\" was in theaters for 101 days, and Lopez's portrayal of Selena became the \"breakthrough role\" (becoming very important) for her career. She became very popular after the movie was released. \"Selena\" was released on VHS and DVD in fall 1997. On September 18, 2007, Warner Bros. released a 10th anniversary of the movie. It featured unreleased \"behind the scenes\" and extras.\nThe movie had mostly positive feedback from critics.

It is a natural cycle.\nThe United States of America had an essential supply of natural resources such as timber, iron, coal, minerals, oil and land. Immigrants provided a plentiful and cheap work force to utilise these resources. This enabled America to become a huge economic power at the beginning of the 20th century. These resources were an important foundation for the economy.\nWhilst European economies suffered during the First World War, the USA experienced significant growth. US banks loaned money to Europe and businesses sold much needed goods. The war also provided a stimulus for inventions in production, materials and advertising. Immediately after the war there was a small slump but from 1922 the USA experienced an unprecedented economic boom.\nElectricity developed slowly before the war but during the 1920s the electricity industry experienced a huge boom. By 1929 the majority of houses in America had electricity and 70 per cent of them used it for lighting purposes. As a result of the development of factories to produce consumer goods for the American people, the demand for electricity doubled. Electrical power was introduced in factories to drive machinery, and thus it became possible to introduce mass production to a number of factories, e.g. refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and radio sets.\nThe car industry is the best example of mass production during the period. Henry Ford was a pioneer with his idea of producing affordable cars for the people of America. He set about realising his dream by producing his early cars in small workshops. He had groups of men working for him and gradually the cars were built.\nHenry Ford and his son posing in the model F Ford car in 1905.\nHenry Ford and his son posing in the model F Ford car in 1905\nHenry Ford's hard work bore fruit. As he produced more and more cars, he could reduce his prices. By 1925 the price of a car was around $290, which was much cheaper than the price of $850 in 1908. Henry Ford was of the opinion that it was better to sell more cars for a small profit, as that meant employing more workers.\nBy 1929 Americans owned 23 million cars. The workers earned good wages ($5 per day), thousands of jobs were created, roads were built, petrol stations were built, as were hotels and restaurants. Therefore, the entire economy was given a substantial boost due to the car industry.\nIn order to help American people to purchase the new goods that were available, systems of hire-purchase and credit were introduced. This meant that a person could buy something by paying for it on a monthly basis. As a result, the majority of Americans could afford expensive goods. In order to encourage Americans to take advantage of the scheme, advertisements were placed on roadsides, on the radio, in newspapers and in cinemas.\nDuring the same period, chain stores appeared for the first time, e.g. J P Penney. Catalogue shopping also became fashionable as it was a convenient way of buying goods."}

{"id": "306842", "revid": "1141473", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306842", "title": "Grignard reaction", "text": "The Grignard reaction (pronounced ) is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides (Grignard reagents) attack electrophilic carbon atoms that are present within polar bonds (for example, in a carbonyl group as in the example shown below). Grignard reagents act as nucleophiles. The Grignard reaction produces a carbon\u2013carbon bond. It alters hybridization about the reaction center. The Grignard reaction is an important tool in the formation of carbon\u2013carbon bonds. It also can form carbon\u2013phosphorus, carbon\u2013tin, carbon\u2013silicon, carbon\u2013boron and other carbon\u2013heteroatom bonds.\nIt is a nucleophilic organometallic addition reaction. The high pKa value of the alkyl component (pKa = ~45) makes the reaction irreversible. Grignard reactions are not ionic. The Grignard reagent exists as an organometallic cluster (in ether).\nThe disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they readily react with protic solvents (such as water), or with functional groups with acidic protons, such as alcohols and amines. Atmospheric humidity can alter the yield of making a Grignard reagent from magnesium turnings and an alkyl halide. One of many methods used to exclude water from the reaction atmosphere is to flame-dry the reaction vessel to evaporate all moisture, which is then sealed to prevent moisture from returning. Chemists then use ultrasound to activate the surface of the magnesium so that it consumes any water present. This can allow Grignard reagents to form with less sensitivity to water being present.\nAnother disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they do not readily form carbon\u2013carbon bonds by reacting with alkyl halides by an SN2 mechanism.\nFran\u00e7ois Auguste Victor Grignard discovered Grignard reactions and reagents. They are named after this French chemist (University of Nancy, France) who was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.\nReaction mechanism.\nThe addition of the Grignard reagent to a carbonyl typically proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state.\nHowever, with steric hindered Grignard reagents, the reaction may proceed by single-electron transfer.\nGrignard reactions will not work if water is present; water causes the reagent to rapidly decompose. So, most Grignard reactions occur in solvents such as anhydrous diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF), because the oxygen in these solvents stabilizes the magnesium reagent. The reagent may also react with oxygen present in the atmosphere. This will insert an oxygen atom between the carbon base and the magnesium halide group. Usually, this side-reaction may be limited by the volatile solvent vapors displacing air above the reaction mixture. However, chemists may perform the reactions in nitrogen or argon atmospheres. In small scale reactions, the solvent vapors do not have enough space to protect the magnesium from oxygen.\nMaking a Grignard reagent.\nGrignard reagents are formed by the action of an alkyl or aryl halide on magnesium metal. The reaction is conducted by adding the organic halide to a suspension of magnesium in an ether, which provides ligands required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound. Typical solvents are diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Oxygen and protic solvents such as water or alcohols are not compatible with Grignard reagents. The reaction proceeds through single electron transfer.\nGrignard reactions often start slowly. First, there is an induction period during which reactive magnesium becomes exposed to the organic reagents. After this induction period, the reactions can be highly exothermic. Alkyl and aryl bromides and iodides are common substrates. Chlorides are also used, but fluorides are generally unreactive, except with specially activated magnesium, such as Rieke magnesium.\nMany Grignard reagents, such as methylmagnesium chloride, phenylmagnesium bromide, and allylmagnesium bromide are available commercially in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether solutions.\nUsing the Schlenk equilibrium, Grignard reagents form varying amounts of diorganomagnesium compounds (R = organic group, X = halide):\nInitiation.\nMany methods have been developed to initiate Grignard reactions that are slow to start. These methods weaken the layer of MgO that covers the magnesium. They expose the magnesium to the organic halide to start the reaction that makes the Grignard reagent.\nMechanical methods include crushing of the Mg pieces \"in situ\", rapid stirring, or using ultrasound (sonication) of the suspension. Iodine, methyl iodide, and 1,2-dibromoethane are commonly employed activating agents. Chemists use 1,2-dibromoethane because its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene. Also, the side-products are innocuous:\nThe amount of Mg consumed by these activating agents is usually insignificant.\nThe addition of a small amount of mercuric chloride will amalgamate the surface of the metal, allowing it to react.\nIndustrial production.\nGrignard reagents are produced in industry for use in place, or for sale. As with at bench-scale, the main problem is that of initiation. A portion of a previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator. Grignard reactions are exothermic; this exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled-up from laboratory to production plant.\nReactions of Grignard reagents.\nReactions with carbonyl compounds.\nGrignard reagents will react with a variety of carbonyl derivatives.\nThe most common application is for alkylation of aldehydes and ketones, as in this example:\nNote that the acetal function (a masked carbonyl) does not react.\nSuch reactions usually involve a water-based (aqueous) acidic workup, though this is rarely shown in reaction schemes. In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to a prochiral aldehyde or ketone, the Felkin-Anh model or Cram's Rule can usually predict which stereoisomer will form.\nReactions with other electrophiles.\nIn addition, Grignard reagents will react with electrophiles.\nAnother example is making salicylaldehyde (not shown above). First, bromoethane reacts with Mg in ether. Second, phenol in THF converts the phenol into Ar-OMgBr. Third, benzene is added in the presence of paraformaldehyde powder and triethylamine. Fourth, the mixture is distilled to remove the solvents. Next, 10% HCl is added. Salicylaldehyde will be the major product as long as everything is very dry and under inert conditions. The reaction works also with iodoethane instead of bromoethane.\nFormation of bonds to B, Si, P, Sn.\nThe Grignard reagent is very useful for forming carbon\u2013heteroatom bonds.\nCarbon\u2013carbon coupling reactions.\nA Grignard reagent can also be involved in coupling reactions. For example, nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl \"p\"-chlorobenzoate to give \"p\"-nonylbenzoic acid, in the presence of Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III), often symbolized as Fe(acac)3, after workup with NaOH to hydrolyze the ester, shown as follows. Without the Fe(acac)3, the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide.\nFor the coupling of aryl halides with aryl Grignards, nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also a good catalyst. Additionally, an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides is dilithium tetrachlorocuprate (Li2CuCl4), prepared by mixing lithium chloride (LiCl) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) in THF. The Kumada-Corriu coupling gives access to [substituted] styrenes.\nOxidation.\nThe oxidation of a Grignard reagent with oxygen takes place through a radical intermediate to a magnesium hydroperoxide. Hydrolysis of this complex yields hydroperoxides and reduction with an additional equivalent of Grignard reagent gives an alcohol.\nformula_1\nA reaction of Grignards with oxygen in presence of an alkene makes an ethylene extended alcohol. These are useful in synthesizing larger compounds. This modification requires aryl or vinyl Grignard reagents. Adding just the Grignard and the alkene does not result in a reaction, showing that the presence of oxygen is essential. The only drawback is the requirement of at least two equivalents of Grignard reagent in the reaction. This can addressed by using a dual Grignard system with a cheap reducing Grignard reagent such as n-butylmagnesium bromide.\nNucleophilic aliphatic substitution.\nGrignard reagents are nucleophiles in nucleophilic aliphatic substitutions for instance with alkyl halides in a key step in industrial Naproxen production:\nElimination.\nIn the Boord olefin synthesis, the addition of magnesium to certain \u03b2-haloethers results in an elimination reaction to the alkene. This reaction can limit the utility of Grignard reactions.\nGrignard degradation.\nGrignard degradation at one time was a tool in structure identification (elucidation) in which a Grignard RMgBr formed from a heteroaryl bromide HetBr reacts with water to Het-H (bromine replaced by a hydrogen atom) and MgBrOH. This hydrolysis method allows the determination of the number of halogen atoms in an organic compound. In modern usage, Grignard degradation is used in the chemical analysis of certain triacylglycerols.\nIndustrial use.\nAn example of the Grignard reaction is a key step in the industrial production of Tamoxifen. (Tamoxifen is currently used for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in women.):"}

The telescope will have over four times the ability to gather light than existing telescopes. It will produce images up to ten times clearer than the Hubble Space Telescope. It will cost $700 million.\nPlanned site.\nThe location of the telescope is the Las Campanas Observatory, which is also the site of the Magellan Telescopes, some northeast of La Serena, Chile. This area has clear weather for most of the year. The night sky in most of the surrounding Atacama Desert region is free from atmospheric pollution. With few cities nearby this is probably one of the places least affected by light pollution. All of this makes the area one of the best spots on Earth for long-term astronomical observation.\nDesign details.\nThe telescope is unique because it will use seven mirror sections, each in diameter. These segments will then be arranged to form a single optical surface. This is difficult as the surface of the outer six mirror segments is not radially symmetrical (that is, they are off-axis). This requires a small change in the way mirrors are usually polished. All seven mirrors will be arranged so that the reflecting surface of each of them is on a common axis. One mirror will be in the center and the other six arranged symmetrically around the center. A focal plane will be on-axis with the entire assembly. The plan is to build seven identical off-axis mirrors. The spare mirror has been made to replace a mirror when it needs recoating, a 1\u20132 week (per segment) process required every 1\u20132 years.\nThe Steward Observatory, at the University of Arizona, is making the mirrors in a laboratory beneath the university's football stadium. It is using a rotating furnace to make the mirror. The casting of the first mirror was completed on November 3, 2005. But the time-consuming shaping and polishing will be completed in the autumn of 2011.\nThe telescope will make use of adaptive optics.\nMember organizations.\nThe following is a list of the group which is developing the telescope.\nGeorge P.

{"id": "306927", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306927", "title": "SN2 reaction", "text": "The SN2 reaction (also known as bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. It is a type of nucleophilic substitution, where a lone pair from a nucleophile attacks an electron deficient electrophilic center and bonds to it. This expels another group called a \"leaving group\". So, the incoming group replaces the leaving group in one step. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow, rate-determining step of the reaction, this leads to the name \"bimolecular nucleophilic substitution\", or \"SN2\". Among inorganic chemists, the SN2 reaction is often known as the \"interchange mechanism\".\nReaction mechanism.\nThe reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it - 'X' - frequently a halide atom. The breaking of the C-X bond and the formation of the new C-Nu bond occur simultaneously to form a transition state in which the carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentacoordinate, and approximately sp2 hybridized. The nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180\u00b0 to the leaving group, since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile's lone pair and the C-X \u03c3* antibonding orbital. The leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed.\nIf the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, this can lead, although not necessarily, to an inversion of stereochemistry, called the Walden inversion.\nIn an example of the SN2 reaction, the attack of OH\u2212 (the nucleophile) on a bromoethane (the electrophile) results in ethanol, with bromide ejected as the leaving group:\nA SN2 reaction occurs if the backside route of attack is not blocked by other atoms in the molecule (sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate). So, this mechanism usually occurs at an unhindered primary carbon center. If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon center, the substitution will use an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism, (an SN1 would also be more likely with blocked molecules because a sufficiently stable carbocation intermediary could be formed.)\nIn coordination chemistry, associative substitution proceeds by a similar mechanism as SN2.\nFactors affecting the rate of the reaction.\nFour factors affect the rate of the reaction:\nReaction kinetics.\nThe rate of an SN2 reaction is second order, as the rate-determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration, [Nu\u2212] as well as the concentration of substrate, [RX].\nThis is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. In the SN1 reaction, the nucleophile attacks after the rate-limiting step is over. But in a SN2 reaction, the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In other words, the rate of SN1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the substrate while the SN2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and nucleophile. In cases where both mechanisms are possible (for example at a secondary carbon center), the mechanism depends on solvent, temperature, concentration of the nucleophile or on the leaving group.\nSN2 reactions are generally favored in primary alkyl halides or secondary alkyl halides with an aprotic solvent. They occur at a negligible rate in tertiary alkyl halides due to steric hindrance.\nSN2 and SN1 are two extremes of a sliding scale of reactions. It is possible to find many reactions which exhibit both SN2 and SN1 character in their mechanisms. For instance, it is possible to get a contact ion pairs formed from an alkyl halide in which the ions are not fully separated. When these undergo substitution the stereochemistry will be inverted (as in SN2) for many of the reacting molecules but a few may show retention of configuration. SN2 reactions are more common than SN1 reactions.\nE2 competition.\nA common side reaction taking place with SN2 reactions is E2 elimination: the incoming anion can act as a base rather than as a nucleophile, removing a proton and leading to formation of the alkene. This effect can be demonstrated in the gas-phase reaction between a sulfonate and a simple alkyl bromide taking place inside a mass spectrometer:\nWith ethyl bromide, the reaction product is predominantly the substitution product. As steric hindrance around the electrophilic center increases, as with isobutyl bromide, substitution is disfavored and elimination is the predominant reaction. Other factors favoring elimination are the strength of the base. With the less basic benzoate substrate, isopropyl bromide reacts with 55% substitution. In general, gas phase reactions and solution phase reactions of this type follow the same trends, even though in the first, solvent effects are dropped.\nRoundabout mechanism.\nA development attracting attention in 2008 concerns a SN2 roundabout mechanism observed in a gas-phase reaction between chloride ions and methyl iodide with a special technique called \"crossed molecular beam imaging\". When the chloride ions have sufficient velocity, the energy of the resulting iodide ions after the collision is much lower than expected, and it is theorized that energy is lost as a result of a full roundabout of the methyl group around the iodine atom before the actual displacement takes place."}
{"id": "306931", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306931", "title": "SN1 reaction", "text": "The SN1 reaction is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. \"SN\" stands for nucleophilic substitution and the \"1\" represents the fact that the rate-determining step involves only one molecule (unimolecular). The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate. Some common SN1 reactions are of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. With primary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. Among inorganic chemists, the SN1 reaction is often known as the \"dissociative mechanism\". Christopher Ingold et al. first proposed the reaction mechanism in 1940.\nMechanism.\nAn example of a reaction taking place with an SN1 reaction mechanism is the hydrolysis of tert-butyl bromide with water to form tert-butyl alcohol:\nThis SN1 reaction takes place in three steps:\nBecause the first step is the bottleneck or \"rate-determining step\" chemists classify the entire reaction mechanism as SN1. Only one molecule is needed for that step.\nScope of the reaction.\nSometimes a molecule can react using either an SN1 or an SN2 mechanism.\nThe SN1 mechanism will win this competition when the central carbon atom is surrounded by bulky groups because such groups sterically hinder the SN2 reaction. Additionally, bulky substituents on the central carbon increase the rate of carbocation formation because of the relief of steric strain that occurs. The resultant carbocation is also stabilized by both inductive stabilization and hyperconjugation from attached alkyl groups. The Hammond-Leffler postulate says that this too will increase the rate of carbocation formation. The SN1 mechanism therefore dominates in reactions at tertiary alkyl centers and is further observed at secondary alkyl centers in the presence of weak nucleophiles.\nAn example of a reaction proceeding in a SN1 way is the synthesis of \"2,5-dichloro-2,5-dimethylhexane\" from the corresponding diol with concentrated hydrochloric acid:\nAs the alpha and beta substitutions increase with respect to leaving groups, the reaction is diverted from SN2 to SN1.\nStereochemistry.\nThe carbocation intermediate formed in the reaction's rate limiting step is an \"sp2\" hybridized carbon with trigonal planar molecular geometry. This allows two different paths for the nucleophilic attack, one on either side of the planar molecule. If neither path is preferentially favored, these two paths will be used equally, yielding a racemic mix of enantiomers if the reaction takes place at a stereocenter. This is illustrated below in the SN1 reaction of S-3-chloro-3-methylhexane with an iodide ion, which yields a racemic mixture of 3-iodo-3-methylhexane:\nHowever, an excess of one stereoisomer can be observed, as the leaving group can remain close to the carbocation intermediate for a short time and block nucleophilic attack. This is very different than the SN2 mechanism, which does not mix the stereochemistry of the product (a stereospecific mechanism). The SN2 mechanism always inverts the molecule's stereochemistry.\nSide reactions.\nTwo common side reactions are elimination reactions and carbocation rearrangement. If the reaction is performed under warm or hot conditions (which favor an increase in entropy), E1 elimination is likely to predominate, leading to formation of an alkene. At lower temperatures, SN1 and E1 reactions are competitive reactions. So, it becomes difficult to favor one over the other. Even if the reaction is performed cold, some alkene may be formed. If an attempt is made to perform an SN1 reaction using a strongly basic nucleophile such as hydroxide or methoxide ion, the alkene will again be formed, this time via an E2 elimination. This will be especially true if the reaction is heated. Finally, if the carbocation intermediate can rearrange to a more stable carbocation, it will give a product derived from the more stable carbocation rather than the simple substitution product.\nSolvent effects.\nSolvents will change the reaction rate. Since the SN1 reaction involves formation of an unstable carbocation intermediate in the rate-determining step, anything that can help this will speed up the reaction. The normal solvents of choice are both \"polar\" (to stabilize ionic intermediates in general) and \"protic\" (to solvate the leaving group in particular). Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles.\nThe Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through\nformula_1\nwith \"m\" a reactant constant (\"m\" = 1 for tert-butyl chloride),\nFor example 100% ethanol gives Y = \u22122.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2."}

A 2.3-million year-old fossil \"Australopithecus africanus\" (nicknamed 'Mrs. Ples') was found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson.

Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found.\nRecent work.\nThe remains of several partial skeletons of a previously unknown Australopithecan species were found in 2008 near Johannesburg. They have been dated to about two million year ago (mya). A recent re-examination of two partial skeletons of \"Australopithecus sediba\" has led to its identification as close to the origin of the genus \"Homo\". Not all palaeoanthropologists agree this is a new species.\nA new analysis shows this species had a human-like pelvis, hands and teeth, and a chimpanzee-like foot. In six separate research reports, palaeontologists reported on the anatomy of a juvenile male skeleton, MH1, a female skeleton, known as MH2, and an isolated adult tibia or shinbone, known as MH4. The findings suggest that some species of australopithecine climbed trees, some walked on the ground, and some did both. \nColleagues in England investigated the teeth. Like other parts of the skeleton, the teeth are a mosaic of primitive and human-like features."}

At the time of her birth her grandfather, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, was the King of Sardinia. \nMarriage.\nMaria Giuseppina was engaged to the French Prince Louis Stanislas of France. He was known as the Count of Provence. They were married on 16 April 1771 \"by proxy\" in the Turin. They were married in person on 14 May 1771 at the Palace of Versailles. A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. She was considered to be ugly. Louis Stanislas hated his wife. We know today that these rumors were created by those who supported Marie Antoinette as a rivalry soon emerged after the youngest brother 'comte d'Artois', married the Comtesse's sister, thereby bringing yet another Savoyard princess to Versailles and creating an Italian party at court. \nIn France she was known as Marie Jos\u00e9phine de Savoie.

It is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs. It can be used to compare rockets of different sizes. It is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel. To do this, one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine. A high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well. If the specific impulse is lower, it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well. \nSpecific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines. It is used much like \"miles per gallon\" or \"litres per 100 kilometres\" is used to compare cars. An engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better. This means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go faster after all fuel is depleted.\nA rocket engine with a higher specific impulse doesn't mean it's 'more powerful'. That is, it will not make the rocket accelerate harder. In fact, the designs for engines with the highest specific impulse, like ion engines, are the 'weakest' of all types of engines. They accelerate the rocket slowly but steadily over a long period of time using only a tiny amount of fuel. In a race between two rockets with the same amount of fuel and two different engines the one with the more powerful engine will take an early lead, but when it burns down all its fuel, the rocket with higher specific impulse will still have some fuel left and will continue to accelerate. Eventually it will overtake its counterpart and will win the race if the distance is big enough for it to use its long-term advantage.\nMeasurements.\nThere are two ways people find the number for specific impulse. To find the specific impulse, one divides the impulse by the amount of fuel. Impulse is a measurement of how much force a rocket motor makes and for how long. A motor that makes a low force for a long time can sometimes have a higher impulse than a motor that makes a high force for a short time. Impulse is measured in Newtons times seconds (N*s). \nThe amount of fuel used to find specific impulse can be measured in different ways. It is sometimes measured in mass and sometimes in weight. When the amount of fuel is measured in mass, the specific impulse is expressed as a speed. This is usually in meters per second. When specific impulse is measured as a speed, it has another name. It is also called the \"effective exhaust velocity\". The other way to measure the amount of fuel is weight. If weight is used, the specific impulse is in units of time, usually in seconds. These two ways are both common. They both compare the performance of engines.\nWhen the specific impulse is higher, less fuel is needed to make the rocket perform at a certain level. So, a fuel is more efficient if the specific impulse is higher.\nBe careful not to confuse thrust and specific impulse. Thrust is only the force made by a rocket at one point in time. Specific impulse is a measure of the force based on how much fuel there is.\nWhen people find specific impulse, the only fuel counted is in the rocket before it gets fired. This includes the fuel and the oxidizer (the part of the fuel that helps the fuel burn). The oxidizer is sometimes oxygen, or often something else (see Rocket engine#Liquids, solids and hybrids).\nExamples.\nJet (airplane) engines use fuel better than rocket engines. This is because the gases do not escape as fast. Because they do not escape as fast, the exhaust does not carry away as much energy. This means that the jet engine uses a lot less energy to push the jet. It is also because the air that goes through the engine as the jet flies through the air helps the fuel to burn faster.\nModel rocketry.\nSpecific impulse is also used to describe how well model rocket motors work. In the table below are some of Estes' claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors: Estes Industries is a large, well known American seller of model rockets and rocket parts. The specific impulse for model rocket motors is much lower than for many other rocket motors because the black powder is used as a fuel. Black powder is used in model rocket motors because it costs less. \nLarger Rocket Engines.\nHere are some example numbers for larger rocket engines:\nUnits.\nThe most common way to measure specific impulse today uses seconds. This is used both in the SI (metric system) world as well as where English units are used. This way the units are identical everywhere. This means specific impulse can be used to compare engine performance in any country. Most companies that make rocket motors or jet engines use seconds to advertise their product\u2019s performance.\nThe other common way to measure specific impulse is in meters per second (m/s), which is also called effective exhaust velocity. For many engines the effective exhaust velocity is different from the speed that the gases actually come out of the nozzle."}

It has alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings. Many of the compounds have a sweet scent, hence the term 'aromatic'. The ring of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible hydrocarbon ring, benzene. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be \"monocyclic\" (MAH) or \"polycyclic\" (PAH).\nSome non-benzene-based compounds called heteroarenes, which follow H\u00fcckel's rule, are also aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur.\nBenzene ring model.\nBenzene, C6H6, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon and was recognized as the first aromatic hydrocarbon, with the nature of its bonding first being recognized by Kekul\u00e9 in the 19th century. \nEach carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighboring carbons. This leaves one to share with one of its two neighboring carbon atoms, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.\nThe structure is also illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This also represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon-carbon bonds each equivalent to ~1.5. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.\nGeneral properties:\nThe circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by Sir Robert Robinson and his student James Armit in 1925 and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison &amp; Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic pi system in some publications, or only those pi systems that obey H\u00fcckel's rule on others.\nArene synthesis.\nA reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an aromatization. Many laboratory methods exist for the organic synthesis of arenes from non-arene precursors.\nImportance of aromatic compounds.\nAromatic compounds play key roles in the biochemistry of all living things. The four aromatic amino acids histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine each serve as one of the 20 basic building blocks of proteins. Further, all 5 nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil) that make up the sequence of the genetic code in DNA and RNA are aromatic purines or pyrimidines. As well as that, the molecule heme contains an aromatic system with 22 \u03c0 electrons. Chlorophyll also has a similar aromatic system.\nAromatic compounds are important in industry. Key aromatic hydrocarbons of commercial interest are benzene, toluene, \"ortho\"-xylene and \"para\"-xylene. About 35 million tonnes are produced worldwide every year. They are extracted from complex mixtures obtained by the refining of oil or by distillation of coal tar. They are used to produce a range of important chemicals and polymers, including styrene, phenol, aniline, polyester and nylon.\nTypes of aromatic compounds.\nAlmost all aromatic compounds are compounds of carbon, but they need not be hydrocarbons.\nHeterocyclics.\nIn heterocyclic aromatics one or more of the atoms in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. Examples include pyridine, pyrazine, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, and thiophene.\nPolycyclics.\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are molecules with two or more simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms. Examples are naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene.\nSubstituted aromatics.\nMany chemical compounds are aromatic rings with other things attached.

He was the last famous member of his mother's aristocratic family, which fell from power after the Peloponnesian War. He played a major role later in that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician.\nDuring the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed sides on several occasions. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated an aggressive foreign policy, and spoke in favor of an invasion of Sicily. He fled to Sparta after his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him.\nIn Sparta, he served as a strategic adviser, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. In Sparta too, however, Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and was forced to defect to Persia. There he served as an adviser to the satrap Tissaphernes until his Athenian political allies brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian general for several years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.\nThe Sicilian Expedition to Magna Graecia was Alcibiades' idea but his enemies prevented him from commanding. His rival Nicias took command, and the expedition failed disastrously. In the years that he served Sparta, Alcibiades played a role in Athens' undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision.\nOnce restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege.p151 Alcibiades' military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state he worked for. His talent for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long. By the end of the war (which he had helped rekindle in the early 410s) his days of political power were a bygone memory.\nIn his youth Alcibiades had been a pupil of Socrates. This was something which told against Socrates at his trial."}

The song was written by Selena's brother who was the producer of her music A.B. Quintanilla III. The song was also written by a Selena y Los Dinos band member Pete Astudillo. It was for her second studio album \"Ven Conmigo\" (1990). The song is about a women who has strong emotions for a man. She exclaims that without him, she will have nothing.\nThe song was not an official single. However, it did peak at number 32 on the Mexican Singles Chart. The song also appealed to a younger crowd. This helped Tejano music to be liked by many young adults. Many LGBT Selena fans had done many cover versions of \"Enamorada de Ti\", who had been performed the song during many drag shows across America. \"Enamorada de Ti\" was given positive feedback from music critics. Many of them wrote about how the song was the first freestyle song to be mixed with Tejano. Selena had promoted the song on her Ven Conmigo Tour, which lasted from 1990-1992.\nProduction and development.\n\"Enamorada de Ti\" was recorded at JAG Records in San Antonio, Texas. The studio was rented for two days by EMI Latin for Selena to record several songs. Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had written the song. Quintanilla III had help from Pete Astudillo, who once was a backup dancer for Selena y Los Dinos. A family friend Brian \"Red\" Moore remixed the song. Quintanilla III had to name the song \"Enmorada de Ti\". By doing this, \"Enamorada de Ti\" became the second song by Selena to have this title. The first song that was titled \"Enamorada de Ti\" was on Selena's independent album \"Mu\u00f1equito de Trapo\" (1986), which had a different meaning.\nThe song is about a women who is in love with a man and can not control her feelings for him. She is in love with a man who is no longer near her, she tells him that she can't live without him and that his love helps relive her depression that she has. The song is a mid-tempo song that is performed in C major with 112 beats per minute. It uses the electronic keyboard and the electric guitar as its main musical instruments. \nThe song had became the first Tejano song to be in freestyle. Selena had wanted to sing songs that could appeal to younger audiences. Quintanilla III had introduced a new \"type\" of sound into Tejano music. This helped to attract younger people to Tejano, which was not liked before by young adults. Quintanilla III was credited and awarded for this at the Tejano Music Awards.\nRelease.\nThe song was not released as an official single, however it managed to peak at number 32 on the Mexican Singles Chart. It stood on the chart for only ten weeks. The song failed to impact any other music chart. Quintanilla III was awarded \"Songwriter of the Year\" for \"Baila Esta Cumbia\", \"No Quiero Saber\", \"Ya Ves\" and \"Enamorada de Ti\"; at the 1991 Tejano Music Awards. Selena promoted \"Enamorada de Ti\" during her Ven Conmigo Tour, which lasted from 1990-1992. She had first performed the song during the 1990 Tejano Music Awards. Javier Lopez, who is an editor for \"TVyNovelas\", stated that Selena's performance of the song was one of best performed dance-moves that night. \nSelena had choreographed dance moves. Selena also copied Micheal Jackson's moonwalk. She also had copied Janet Jackson's \"Rhythm Nation\" dance move. That night she had won \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year\". Selena had performed the song on the Spanish-language television show called \"Bailando\" in October 1992. She also had performed the song during the 1992 Lo Nuestro Awards in Miami, Florida. Her final performance was at her Los Angeles, California concert. She performed the song as her first number in November 1993.\nThe song has been covered by LGBT Selena fans. The song was also performed in many drag shows across the United States.\nCritical reception.\nCarla Manuela Dejesus, who is an editor for \"Furia Musical\", stated that \"Enamorada de Ti\" was one of the \"best freestyle-tejano songs\" in Tejano history. Sebastian Rodriguez, who is an editor for \"TVyNovelas\", wrote that \"Enamorada de Ti\" was one of the best songs composed for \"Ven Conmigo\".

A mass spectrum tells the size and elements found in each molecule fragment. Chemists use their understanding of how molecules break apart to guess the structure of the original molecule. Many different molecules break apart with \u03b1-cleavage inside the mass spectrometer. Many times, \u03b1-cleavage explains the resulting mass spectra.\nAs an example of a mechanism of alpha cleavage, an electron is knocked off an atom (usually by electron collision) to form a radical cation. Electrons are most likely to be removed in the following order: 1) lone pair electrons, 2) pi bond electrons, 3) sigma bond electrons.\nOne of the lone pair electrons moves down to form a pi bond with an electron from an adjacent (alpha) bond. The other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom (not one adjacent to the lone pair atom) creating a radical. This creates a double bond adjacent to the lone pair atom (oxygen is a good example) and breaks (cleaves) the bond that lost the two electrons that were removed.\nIn molecules containing carbonyl groups, alpha cleavage often competes with a McLafferty rearrangement.\nPhotochemistry.\nIn photochemistry, it is the homolytic cleavage of a bond close to a specified group."}

DKA happens mostly in people with Type 1 diabetes, although it may happen in some people that have Type 2 diabetes.\nDKA happens when a person does not have enough insulin in their body. All of the cells in the body need glucose (sugar) to survive, because the body needs sugar to make energy. Insulin breaks down glucose into a form that the body can use for energy. Without insulin, sugar stays in the blood and cannot get into the cells. This causes high blood sugar levels and makes it impossible for the cells to use glucose to make energy.\nDKA can be caused by not having enough insulin, eating too many carbohydrates, and sometimes physical or mental stress. DKA can also be a sign that a person has diabetes that has not been discovered, or is not being controlled well.\nDKA is diagnosed through blood and urine testing. These tests will show high blood sugar, which does not happen with other forms of ketoacidosis.\nDKA was first discovered around 1886. Before insulin therapy was first used in the 1920s, DKA almost always caused death.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of DKA include:\nAs DKA gets worse, it can cause these symptoms:\nWithout proper treatment, DKA can cause death.\nHow Does DKA Happen?\nFirst, because there is not enough insulin to bring glucose into the cells, glucose builds up in the blood. This causes there to be too much sugar in the blood and not enough in the cells. The cells start starving, because they do not have insulin to break down glucose into a form that the cells can use for energy.\nTo try to create energy for the cells, the liver breaks down fat into fatty acids and ketones. These create a little bit of energy, but they are also acidic. The blood starts to get too acidic, and the body starts to get poisoned.\nBecause the cells still do not have enough glucose to create the energy they need, the liver also breaks down glycogen to make more glucose. (The body stores sugar in different forms in case it needs energy later. Glucagon helps break down some of these sugar stores into glucose.) However, there is still not enough insulin in the blood to break down the glucose into energy. Because of this, the glucose stays in the blood (making the blood sugar levels get even higher) and the cells keep starving.\nNext, the body begins to break down protein. (When the body cannot create enough energy by breaking down fat and glycogen into sugar, it breaks down protein.) This causes the tissues in the body to lose nitrogen.\nNow there is much more glucose in the bloodstream than in the cells. The body always tries to stay in homeostasis. In homeostasis, there would be an equal amount of sugar in the bloodstream and the cells. To try to make this happen, the cells (which have very little sugar in them) give up water to the blood (which is very sugary). The goal is to try to dilute the sugar in the blood, and decrease the high levels of hyperglycemia. If the cells give up too much water, they can get dehydrated (not have enough fluid left in them). Because DKA also causes a person to urinate often, a person with DKA can get dehydrated very quickly. This dehydration can be a medical emergency.\nThe kidneys try to filter out the extra glucose in the bloodstream. This causes glucosuria (too much sugar in the urine). The extra glucose going through the kidneys causes more urine to be created. When a person urinates more, they lose more electrolytes, like sodium and potassium. Without enough electrolytes, the heart, muscles, and nerve cells cannot work properly. Also, eventually, the kidneys can fail because they are overworked by the amount of glucose they are trying to filter.\nTreatment.\nPeople with DKA need to be treated in a hospital. Usually, treatment involves:"}

In late January 2008, Bushmaster made a licensing agreement with Magpul. In this agreement, Bushmaster would take over the production, development and sales of the ACR.\nBushmaster Firearms, with the help from Remington Arms (a sister company) has made many design changes to the ACR. These were made to meet what the U.S. military requirements. The Remington ACR which is intended for the military market is capable of fully automatic fire. Bushmaster offers a semi-automatic only ACR for the civilian market. Bushmaster says that they will soon have conversion kits which can change the caliber of the rifle.\nHistory.\nThe United States army was looking for a replacement to their M4 carbine. Remington Arms was part of the Army's Individual Carbine competition, and offered a modified ACR that fits the requirements.\nThe Masada was developed over the course of five months. It was supposed to replace the M16 rifle completely. It was supposed to do this without any fundings from the government. Prototypes were shown at the 2007 SHOT Show in Orlando, Florida. It was supposed to be released some time in 2008. However, Bushmaster said on May 16, 2008 took over production and said that the ACR would not be released to the public until 2009. This was due to Bushmaster being focused more towards military projects. On November 18, 2008, Bushmaster released a statement saying, \"The ACR is being redesigned to become a superior offering to compete for the next generation U.S. Army infantry carbine and subcompact weapon requirement and will be available to selected customers in 2009.\"\nThe ACR was one of the weapons shown to the U.S. Army during an Industry Day on November 13, 2008. This Industry Day happened so that modern carbines could be looked at before it was decided what the weapon that would replace the M4 Carbine had to be like.\nSale and recall.\nOn October 15, 2010, Bushmaster issued a recall of all ACR rifles, instructing users to \"Please immediately discontinue the use of your ACR rifle\" along with instructions to contact customer support for an RMA. Bushmaster stated that the recall was issued due to \"a possible firearms performance issue that may develop with a small number of ACR rifles\" and goes on to state that \"Bushmaster discovered a design flaw which could result in multiple rounds firing continuously when the trigger is pulled\". Bushmaster has stated that it will cover all of the costs associated with repairs to recalled rifles.\nDesign.\nThe first design is many recent rifle designs combined. Its designers say that it takes the best parts of each and puts them into a light, modular rifle. Some features from the Armalite AR-18, the FN SCAR, the Heckler &amp; Koch G36/XM8, the M16/AR-15, and the M16 can be seen clearly. The cyclic rate of fire is around 650\u2013700 rounds per minute. The ACR can easily swap caliber by changing the bolt head, magazine and barrel.\nThe ACR is available in multiple barrel lengths; 8.25\u2033, 10.5\u2033, 14.5\u2033, 16.5\u2033 and 18.5\u2033 barrels. For the 5.56mm configuration, it uses a 30-round Magpul PMag, though it is also compatible with STANAG magazines. Magpul claims that PMags are much more difficult to break or damage than other magazines, and is also compatible to other rifle families like the M16 rifle family. The ACR was engineered to still function reliably even if it was exposed to sand, dirt, mud and water."}

Fishmongers can be wholesalers or retailers. In many places there are fewer fishmongers than there used to be. Supermarkets have often replaced independent seafood sellers. Female fishmongers used to have a separate name, fishwife.\nWorshipful Company of Fishmongers.\nThe fishmongers guild, was started in the City of London by a Royal Charter from Edward I soon after he became king in 1272. Guild members could not have foreign partners. Selling fish was tightly controlled to make sure it was fresh and to keep profits low. However, the guild grew rich. After Edward's victory over the Scots, they put on a great show, including one thousand mounted knights.\nWhile Edward II was king, the fishmongers lost political power. Parliament made a rule that a fishmonger could not become mayor of the city. This rule was soon canceled, though. The fishmongers guild became richer so that while Edward III was king the guild could give \u00a340 to the war against the French. This was a large amount of money at that time.\nThe guild was then reformed as the \"Mystery of the Fishmongers of London\". They were the only ones allowed to advertise or sell fish. They also regulated catching fish in the Thames. The river had many fish such as salmon at that time. The guild still continues today as one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies.\nFishmongers in culture.\nSome believe that the word fishmonger in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" was a euphemism for a \"fleshmonger,\" or pimp. \nIn the English translation of the Asterix series, the village fishmonger is called Unhygienix. \nIn the film \"The Beach\", the island's chef has only fish for meat, and is named Unhygienix after to the Asterix character.\nCharles Fort included the story of the Mad Fishmonger or \"St. Fishmonger\" in his book \"Lo!\" According to the story St. Fishmonger made crabs and periwinkles fall from the sky. The story later appears in the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat Trilogy\" by Robert Anton Wilson. \nDr. Ahmed Fishmonger is a writer and artist active in the Church of the Subgenius.\nIn many countries, the fishwife had a reputation for speaking boldly. In Medieval France, fishwives in Paris were allowed to speak honestly and directly to the King himself when he went into the marketplace. They could be critical without fear of punishment."}

Deep frying cooks food very quickly. Deep frying is popular is the United Kingdom - one dish popular in the United Kingdom is fish and chips.\nTechnique.\nIf done well, deep-frying does not make food too greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water in the food, steaming it from the inside out. The water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface of the oil. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not in the oil for too long, oil will only enter the surface of the food. However, if the food is cooked in the oil for too long, much of the water will be lost and the oil will begin to penetrate the food. The correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food, but is usually between 175 and 190 \u00b0C (345\u2013375 \u00b0F). \nSome fried foods are given a coating of batter or breading prior to frying. This makes the outside of the food crispy and browned, while the inside becomes tender, moist, and steamed. Some foods \u2013 such as potatoes or whole, skin-on poultry \u2013 have a natural coating and do not require breading or battering.\nDisadvantages.\nDeep frying makes large amounts of waste oil. Getting rid of the oil properly may be a problem. Waste oil is increasingly being recycled into biodiesel.\nSome deep fry shortenings have trans fat.\nCooking oil can burn well and may catch fire if it is used at too high a temperature. Trying to put out an oil fire with water makes the fire worse. Instead, oil fires must be put out with a fire extinguisher or by smothering."}

His research involves the generation and reactivity of carbocations using superacids. For this research, Olah was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1994. The American Chemical Society gave him its highest honor, the Priestley Medal.\nLife.\nOlah was born in Budapest, Hungary, on May 22, 1927. He studied high school at Budapesti Piarista Gimnazium (Scolopi fathers). He studied, then taught, at what is now Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he and his family moved briefly to England, They then moved to Canada. He joined Dow Chemical in Sarnia, Ontario, with another Hungarian chemist, Stephen J. Kuhn. During Olah's eight years with Dow, he started to study carbocations. In 1965, he left Dow for Case Western Reserve University. He joined the University of Southern California faculty in 1977. In 1971, Olah became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\nOlah was a distinguished professor at the University of Southern California and the director of the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute. In 2005, Olah wrote an essay promoting the methanol economy.\nThe Olah family formed an endowment fund (the George A. Olah Endowment). It grants annual awards to outstanding chemists. The American Chemical Society selects and administers the awards.\nOlah died on March 8, 2017 at his home in Beverly Hills, California, aged 89.\nWork.\nThe search for stable carbocations led to the discovery of protonated methane. (Protonated methane is a methane molecule (CH4) with an extra proton giving it a positive charge.) Protonated methane was stabilized by superacids, like FSO3H-SbF5 (\"Magic Acid\"). \nOlah also studied how hydrocarbons are used as fuel.\nOlah also disagreed for many years with Herbert C. Brown of Purdue University over the existence of so-called \"nonclassical\" carbocations \u2013 such as the norbornyl cation. They can be shown as cationic character shared (delocalized) over several bonds.\nIn recent years, his research has shifted from hydrocarbons (including hydrocarbon fuel) to the methanol economy. He joined Robert Zubrin, Anne Korin, and James Woolsey in calling for a Flexible-fuel vehicle mandate initiative."}

In that context, an eigenvector is a vector\u2014different from the null vector\u2014which does not change direction after the transformation (except if the transformation turns the vector to the opposite direction). The vector may change its length, or become zero (\"null\"). The eigenvalue is the value of the vector's change in length, and is typically denoted by the symbol formula_1. The word \"eigen\" is a German word, which means \"own\" or \"typical\".\nBasics.\nIf there exists a square matrix called A, a scalar \"\u03bb, and a non-zero vector v, then \u03bb\" is the eigenvalue and v is the eigenvector if the following equation is satisfied:\nIn other words, if matrix \"A\" times the vector v is equal to the scalar \"\u03bb\" times the vector v, then \"\u03bb\" is the eigenvalue of v, where v is the eigenvector.\nAn eigenspace of \"A\" is the set of all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue together with the zero vector. However, the zero vector is not an eigenvector.\nThese ideas often are extended to more general situations, where scalars are elements of any field, vectors are elements of any vector space, and linear transformations may or may not be represented by matrix multiplication. For example, instead of real numbers, scalars may be complex numbers; instead of arrows, vectors may be functions or frequencies; instead of matrix multiplication, linear transformations may be operators such as the derivative from calculus. These are only a few of countless examples where eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important.\nIn cases like these, the idea of \"direction\" loses its ordinary meaning, and has a more abstract definition instead. But even in this case, if that abstract \"direction\" is unchanged by a given linear transformation, the prefix \"eigen\" is used, as in \"eigenfunction\", \"eigenmode\", \"eigenface\", \"eigenstate\", and \"eigenfrequency\".\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors have many applications in both pure and applied mathematics. They are used in matrix factorization, quantum mechanics, facial recognition systems, and many other areas.\nExample.\nFor the matrix \"A\"\nthe vector \nis an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. Indeed, one can verify that:\nOn the other hand the vector \nis \"not\" an eigenvector, since\nand this vector is not a multiple of the original vector x."}

According to the modern definition, a superacid has a chemical potential of the proton higher than that of pure sulfuric acid.\nChemists use strong acids to break down other molecules. Some molecules are so strong (held together with strong chemical bonds) that they resist attack by common acids. Superacids can break down molecules that stand up to most other acids.\nCommercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H), also known as triflic acid, and fluorosulfonic acid (FSO3H). Both superacids are about a thousand times stronger (that is, have more negative \"H\"0 values) than sulfuric acid. The strongest superacids are prepared by the combination of two components, a strong Lewis acid and a strong Br\u00f8nsted acid. The strongest known superacid is fluoroantimonic acid."}

A 1984 World Health Organization report into suggested up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings around the world may be linked to symptoms of SBS. Most of the sick building syndrome is related to poor indoor air quality.\nSBS can be caused by flaws in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Other causes have been contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials, volatile organic compounds (VOC), molds (see mold health issues), improper exhaust ventilation of ozone (byproduct of some office machinery), using light industrial chemicals in the building, or lack of adequate fresh-air intake/air filtration (see Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value).\nPeople try to fix SBS symptoms by increasing the overall turn-over rate of fresh air exchange between the building's air and the outside air. But the new green building design goals should be able to avoid most of the SBS sources in the first place. Cleaners should lower their use of dangerous VOC cleaning compounds, and get rid of conditions that cause allergenic, potentially-deadly mold growth.\nSymptoms.\nBuilding occupants complain of symptoms such as irritation of the eyes, nose, throat; neurotoxic or general health problems; skin irritation; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions; and odor and taste sensations.\nSeveral sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected. The key to discovery SBS is if a number of people first experience their illnesses within a period of weeks. In most cases, SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone. However, there can be lasting effects of various neurotoxins, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building. Sensitive individuals can have long-term health effects.\nPrevention.\nThe following steps can avoid SBS:\nGender differences.\nThere might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men. Along with this, some studies found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors, because they have a tendency to have more clerical work where they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: blueprint machines), while men may more often have jobs based outside of offices."}

Others dig holes in the ground, or live part of their life in the water. New world rats and mice do not hibernate, but on cold days in winter, they sometimes fall into a torpor.\nThe New World rats and mice have many predators, and usually live only a short time. In the wild, these animals usually live for less than a year, but they have reached ages of up to five years old when kept indoors and protected by people. Some species have adapted to humans, and are hemerophile. This has also shown in some common names, such as the Cotton rat, Marsh rice rat, Brown Cane Mouse or Short-tailed Cane Mouse."}

{"id": "307396", "revid": "506322", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307396", "title": "The Winter's Tale", "text": "The Winter's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare, published in the First Folio, in 1623. It was grouped among the comedies, but some modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics, among them W. W. Lawrence, consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\", because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comedic and supply a happy ending. \nDespite this, the play has been popular, and there are different adaptations of it to the stage. The first was done by David Garrick in his adaptation called \"Florizel and Perdita\"; first performed in 1754 and published in 1756. \"The Winter's Tale\" was revived again in the 19th century, when the third \"pastoral\" act was widely popular). In the second half of the 20th century \"The Winter's Tale\" was often performed as a whole. The text was usually taken from the First Folio.\nPlot.\nPolixenes, King of Bohemia, visits his old friend Leontes, King of Sicilia. Leontes wants Polixenes to stay longer, but at first Polixenes wants to go home. However, he is persuaded to stay for longer by Leontes's wife, Queen Hermione. Leontes starts to fear that Hermione and Polixenes are in love with each other. Leontes orders Lord Camillo to poison Polixenes, but Camillo decides to warn Polixenes instead and they run away together to Bohemia.\nLeontes is furious. He accuses his wife of betraying him and puts her in prison. He orders two lords, Cleomenes and Dion, to visit the Oracle, a wise person who is believed to know everything. When Hermione gives birth to a daughter, Leontes believes that Polixenes is the girl's father. He orders Lord Antigonus to take the baby away and abandon her. Hermione is put on trial, when Cleomenes and Dion return with the Oracle's reply. Leontes does not want to hear it, but they read it out. The Oracle says that Hermione and Polixenes were never in love with each other, that Camillo is an honest man, and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found.\nNews then comes in that Leontes's only son, Mamillus, has died. He fell ill after seeing his mother being accused by his father. Hermione then collapses. Leontes is then told that she has died. He is left in despair. He vows to make up for what he has done wrong and find his lost daughter. Meanwhile, Hermione appears to Antigonus in a dream and tells him to name the baby Perdita. He leaves the baby on the coast, with her name written down and some jewellery to show she comes from a noble family. He is then chased away by a bear (and probably killed). Perdita is later found by a shepherd.\nSixteen years pass. Camillo lives with Polixenes but wants to return home to Sicilia. Polixenes believes his son, Prince Florizel, has fallen in love with a shepherd girl called Perdita. Polixenes and Camillo disguise themselves and go to the shepherd's feast to see if this is true. They watch Florizel get engaged with Perdita at the feast. Polixenes then removes his disguise and angrily tells his son never to see Perdita again. Camillo steps in and instead takes Florizel and Perdita to Sicilia, with the shepherd's family joining them.\nBack in Sicilia, Leontes is still mourning his family. Cleomenes and Dion want the king to marry again, but Leontes believes no woman would be as good as Hermione, and his servant Paulina agrees. Florizel arrives and tries to hide why he has come, but it gets revealed once Polixenes and Camillo also arrive. After all that has happened, everyone becomes friends again. Once Leontes learns that the shepherds raised Perdita, he decides to make them lords in his kingdom. Paulina then takes them to see a statue of Hermione that has just been finished. The statue comes to life, and Hermione is alive once more. Everyone celebrates the miracle.\nAbout the play.\nLike most of Shakespeare's plays, it was based off an existing story. It is mainly based off a 1588 play called \"Pandosto\" by Robert Greene. Shakespeare made less changes to the story than he would usually make. The main difference is that he changed it from a sad ending to a happy ending. Shakespeare made other, smaller changes. All the characters have different names, and Bohemia and Sicilia are swapped around.\nThe play has five \"acts\" (parts). The first three acts have tense drama. A character called \"Time\" briefly appears to announce the sixteen-year time jump between the third and fourth acts. The last two acts are much lighter in tone. They are like the \"pastoral\" plays that were popular around Shakespeare's time, which were light plays that were set in the countryside. Although the play has a happy ending, some of the tragedy cannot be undone: Mamillus is still dead, and the bad things that happened in the past cannot be forgotten.\nIt appears Shakespeare was not trying to make the play realistic. Many things in the play suggest it is set in Europe in Shakespeare's day, but the \"Oracle of Delphos\" sounds like the Oracle of Delphi in Ancient Greece. This was located in the mountains, not on an island like in the play. In the play, it is also said that Bohemia has a coastline and deserts. The real Bohemia was located where the Czech Republic is now located. It never had a coastline or deserts. Shakespeare might have chosen to make it unrealistic, in order to make the play feel more like a fantasy. \nThe play also has a famous moment when Antigonus is chased away by a bear. In the stage directions, this is written as \"Exit, pursued by a bear.\" It is not known whether Shakespeare used a real bear, or whether it was an actor dressed as a bear.\nIt is not clear how Hermione returns at the end of the play. The play suggests it might be magic, but it also suggests that Hermione was alive all along."}

The tour was to promote her seventh independent LP record \"Dulce Amor\" (1988). The tour began on November 26, 1988, in Corpus Christi, Texas. The concert ended on July 26, 1989, in Houston, Texas. Selena had sung a lot of covers during this tour. She also had begun designing her own clothing.\nSelena was inspired by Janet Jackson, Madonna and Paula Abdul for designing her own clothing. Selena was inspired by Michael Jackson for dance moves that she could perform. In some concerts, Selena was underpaid by venues across Texas. She was not paid fairly because she was a female lead-singer in a male-dominated genre. Selena had food thrown at her by Tejano fans at one of her concerts.\nThe concert tour had grossed only $4,500. The concert ended because of angry fans and because Selena was being promoted to EMI Latin.\nAbout this tour.\nThe Dulce Amor Tour started on November 26, 1988, in Corpus Christi, Texas, Selena's hometown. The tour was also her last independent tour before signing a contract with EMI Latin. Selena had asked her father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, if she could design the band's clothing. Her father did not want her to choose the band's clothing. However, he did give her permission to design her own clothing.\nSelena had inspiration from Madonna, Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson. She also had inspiration for dance moves from Micheal Jackson and other popular 1980s singers. When the tour had begun, Selena had performed more cover versions then her own songs. Selena felt that she should sing popular music to help the band become more popular. The concerts had usually lasted for an hour and a half.\nSelena was paid only $150 for each concert. However, some venues underpaid Selena because she was a female lead-singer in a male-dominated genre. Venues who booked Selena felt that she would never become a huge successful singer. Some even laughed at Selena's father for even promoting her. During several concerts, food was thrown at Selena by Tejano fans.\nSelena was discriminated against and was not allowed to perform at some venues. However, the Dulce Amor Tour became the most successful tour in Selena's early career. This was because, more venues had booked Selena to perform and attendance to her concerts were growing. The Dulce Amor Tour had grossed $4,500.\nIn some concerts such as the December 10, 1988 Dallas, Texas concert, Selena had performed \"T\u00fa Solamente T\u00fa\", \"Qu\u00e9\", \"Soy Amiga\", \"Dame Tu Amor\", \"Dame Un Beso\" and \"A Million To One\". In this concert, she only had done two covers that night.\nOn February 20, 1989, Selena performed in Odessa, Texas. Her concert had ended early because Tejano fans were throwing food at Selena. Selena only got to perform \"Costumbres\", \"Quisiera Darte\", \"I Like It\", \"No More Lies\" and \"Dulce Amor\". Selena and her band were taken back to their tour bus. The club owner did not pay Selena. He felt that he now needed the money to clean up the mess. He also banned Selena to ever perform again at his venue until 1994, after she had won a Grammy Award."}

It was designed by Georgi Shpagin. The PPSh-41 was supposed to be a cheaper, simpler gun to use than the PPD-40. The PPD-40 was in Soviet service at that time. The PPSh-41 officially replaced the PPD-40 in 1941. The PPSh-41 was supposed to be used by conscripted soldiers with very little training. The PPSh-41 got its ammunition from a magazine. It was also a selective fire submachine gun. It was made mostly of stamped steel. It fired the 7.62\u00d725mm pistol round. The PPSh-41 was used a lot during World War II and the Korean War, as it was the most produced SMG throughout the wars. It was still in use in Vietnam with the Viet Cong as late as 1970 as the Chinese Type 50 (a copy). There were even some PPSh-41's captured by US soldiers as late as the Iraq War.\nHistory.\nWorld War II.\nThe idea for the development of the PPSh-41 came partly from the Winter War against Finland. It was found in this war that submachine guns were good weapons for close-quarters combat. The PPSh-41 was developed in mid-1941. It was made in many factories in Moscow. Local Party members were made responsible for making sure enough PPSh-41s were made.\nA few hundred weapons were made in November 1941. Another 155,000 were made over the next five months. By spring 1942, PPSh-41 factories were making around 3,000 weapons a day. The PPSh-41's design was good, as it allowed many weapons to be made in a short amount of time (mass production). Other examples of this kind of design were the M3 submachine gun, MP40 and the Sten. Its parts (except the barrel) could be made by unskilled workers. The PPSh-41 used 87 parts, and the PPD-40 used 95. The PPSh-41 could be made in 7.3\u00a0hours. However, the PPD-40 took 13.7\u00a0hours. The making of the barrel was often made simpler by using barrels made for the M1891 Mosin\u2013Nagant rifle. The rifle barrel was cut in half. From this one rifle barrel, two PPSh-41 barrels were made. The barrel was then altered for the 7.62mm Soviet submachine gun cartridge.\nThe PPSh-41 was popular in the German armies as well. Captured PPSh-41s were often used by the Germans against their enemies. It was so popular among German soldiers, in fact, that it was the second most used SMG among German forces in WWII.\nAfter the German Army captured a lot of PPSh-41s during World War II, a program was started. In this program, the weapons would be altered to fire the German submachine gun bullet, the 9mm Parabellum. The Wehrmacht officially called these PPSh-41s the MP41(r). PPSh-41s which were not altered were called the MP717(r). They were given 7.63x25mm Mauser ammunition instead of the Soviet 7.62x25mm bullet. The German military made German-language manuals to teach soldiers how to use the PPSh-41. These were printed and given out across the Wehrmacht.\nThe Soviet Union also tried the PPSh-41 in close air support. They put dozens of PPSh-41s on some of their planes.\nOver 6 million PPSh-41s were made by the end of the war. After the Battle of Stalingrad, they became the most used small arms in the Red Army. The Soviets would often give whole regiments or even divisions the PPSh-41. This gave them excellent close-range power.\nKorean War.\nAfter the war, a large number of PPSh-41s were given to Soviet client states. They were also handed out to communist guerillas. The North Korean People's Army (NKPA) and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) fighting in Korea got huge amounts of PPSh-41s. They were also given the North Korean Type 49 and the Chinese Type 50. These were copies of the PPSh-41s with small changes. The PPSh-41 was used a lot during the entire Korean War. Though it was not very accurate, the PPSh-41 did well in close-range battles because of its extremely high rate of fire and its high ammo capacity. These often happened in the Korean War, especially at night. United Nations forces often had trouble with returning enough bullets when they were attacked by communists with the PPSh-41. Some U.S. infantry officers said that the PPSh-41 was the best gun of the war. It was not as accurate as the U.S. M1 Garand or M1 carbine. However, it gave more power at close range.\nFeatures.\nThe PPSh-41 fired the 7.62x25mm (Tokarev) bullet. The 7.62x25mm was the main Soviet pistol and submachine gun bullet. The PPSh-41 weighed around 12\u00a0pounds (5.45\u00a0kg) with a full 71-round magazine. It weighed 9.5\u00a0pounds (4.32\u00a0kg) with a loaded 35-round magazine. The PPSh-41 could fire 900 rounds per minute. This was very high compared to other submachine guns of World War II. The PPSh-41 did not have a grip on it. Because of this, the soldier usually had to hold the PPSh-41 behind the drum magazine. The soldier could also hold the bottom of the drum. 35-round box magazines could have been used from 1942. However, Soviet soldiers in World War II usually kept the 71-round drum magazine.\nThe PPSh-41 drum magazine was a copy of the Finnish M31 Suomi magazine. It held 71 rounds. The drum magazine was slower and more difficult to load with ammunition than the box magazine. The box magazine began to be used more after 1942. Even though it had less bullets in it, the box magazine made it easier to hold the weapon. It was possible that the PPSh-41 would fire bullets if it was dropped on a hard surface. This was because of its open bolt design.\nDifferent kinds of PPSh-41.\nBecause the Germans had captured so many PPSh-41s, a program was started. In this program, the weapons would be altered to fire the German submachine gun bullet. This bullet was called the 9mm Parabellum. The Wehrmacht officially called these PPSh-41s the MP41(r). PPSh-41s which were not altered were called the MP717(r). They were given 7.63x25mm Mauser ammunition instead of the Soviet 7.62x25mm bullet. The German military made German-language manuals to teach soldiers how to use the PPSh-41. These were printed and given out across the Wehrmacht.\nDuring World War II, an even simpler submachine gun was brought in to service. It was called the PPS-43. However, it did not replace the PPSh-41 during the war."}

The series tries to collect, to describe and to explain a huge number of inscriptions. The inscriptions used date from medieval and early modern times. The Inscriptions are in today's Federal Republic of Germany, Republic of Austria and South Tyrol. The project was instituted by the German linguist Friedrich Panzer (from Heidelberg) in 1934. The historians Karl Brandi (from G\u00f6ttingen) and Hans Hirsch (from Vienna) helped him with his effort. The scientists planed the task as an interacademic venture to publish writings concerning epigraphy. By now 81 volumes have been published. An individual volume contains usually the inscriptions of a single city, of a German district or an Austrian district. Several of the Academies of Sciences work together to publish the volumes and to push the project further. The German Academies involved are in Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Mainz, G\u00f6ttingen und M\u00fcnchen. Also the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna is involved. The Reichert-Verlag is the publishing house of the scientific editions.\nDeutsche Inschriften Online (DIO).\nThe Academies of Sciences in Mainz and G\u00f6ttingen planed and carried the project \"Deutsche Inschriften Online\" (English: German Inscriptions Online) out. The project's ambition was to digitalize the volumes DI 66/45/56/58/61 and make them available online. The realisation is based on a database who was developed by the Inscription-offices in Greifswald and Mainz. The venture has an innovative character. It is seeing itself as a broadening of the project \"Inschriften Mittelrhein-Hunsr\u00fcck (IMH)\" (English: Inscriptions of the Middlerhine-Hunsr\u00fcck). The IMH-Project was worked out in 2008. The \"Institut f\u00fcr Geschichtliche Landeskunde an der Universit\u00e4t Mainz\" (English: Institute for Regional History at the University of Mainz) took part in working out the IMH-Project. The project digitalized the volume \"Die Inschriften des Rhein-Hunsr\u00fcck Kreises I (DI 60)\" (English: The Inscriptions of the Rhine-Hunsr\u00fcck District) edited by epigraphist Eberhard J. Nikitsch. In the meantime the website of the IMH-Project has merged into the DIO-Web portal. In the long run digitalization and making available online of further volumes is scheduled. Also a translation of the DIO-Website into the English language is projected.\nBesides the digitalized volumes DIO features an elaborated search interface, news concerning epigraphy and series of articles. The series featured are \"Epigraphischer Tipp\" (English: Epigraphical Hint) and \"Inschrift im Fokus\" (English: Focused on Inscription). There are also a glossary and a list of topical weblinks. Additionally the site presents a wide array of photographs and pictures of inscriptions or things alike. By this means the publishers try to interweave different alternatives of presenting information to the public.\nToday twelve volumes including more than 4170 items and more than 4000 illustrations and photographs can be retrieved by the user. Currently online available are the volumes DI-19 G\u00f6ttingen (City), DI-28 Hameln, DI-36 Hannover, DI-42 Einbeck, DI-45 Goslar, DI-56 Braunschweig, DI-58 Hildesheim, DI-60 Rhein-Hunsr\u00fcck-Kreis I, DI-61 Helmstedt, DI-66 G\u00f6ttingen (District), DI-46 Minden, The Inscriptions of the City of Mainz.

While touring on the Entre A Mi Mundo Tour, Selena had decided to perform a song she had recently written. The song was called \"Little Bidi Bubbles\", \"Little Bubbles\" and \"Swim Swim Swim!\" The song was in English and had talked about a fish swimming in the ocean happily. The fish was given only one wish and had decided to give that wish away to another fish she had really liked. The song was performed in the style of roots reggae mixed with cumbia music. The song had became a sound check for Selena y Los Dinos, after Selena had written the song. Initially, Selena had wanted to perform the song to her fans and see their reactions before she would professionally record it. The song was not recorded even though it was given positive feedback from fans. \nA.B. Quintanilla III, Selena's brother, was short on songs to be recorded for Selena's next studio album. A.B had wanted to record an \"exotic progressive\" album that would help Selena to expand her fan base even bigger. He then decided to finish writing \"Little Bidi Bubbles\" and turn it into a Caribbean reggae song mixed with Colombian cumbia to attract fans from the Caribbean. Pete Astudillo, a former back-up dancer for the band, also helped with writing the song. Chris Perez, the widower of Selena, had brought Rock fusion and guitar solos into the song. The song was written in Spanish and was produced by A.B., Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla Jr and Bebu Silvetti. Brian \"Red\" Moore, a family friend, had mixed the song. Roger Emerson became the music arranger for the song. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was recorded in Q-Productions in Corpus Christi, Texas.\nAround the early months of 1994, the lyrics of the song was finished. Selena had recorded the song a few weeks afterwards. A.B. told interviewers that he was afraid and nervous about releasing the song because of its mixed music genres. He also said that the use of mixed genres had never been done before for a Tejano singer. After \"Amor Prohibido\" (1994) was released, EMI Latin had a hard time choosing a lead single. Selena and the record company had wanted \"Amor Prohibido\" as the lead single, whereas A.B. had wanted \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\". A.B. had tried to convince his sister and EMI, but was unsuccessful. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" had then became a promotional single for the album.\nWhen Selena was killed on March 31, 1995, she was in the middle of releasing a crossover album. EMI Latin and Selena's family had decided to release it on July 18 of that same year. However, since the album was not finished, they were short on songs. A.B. had then made a few remix versions of Selena's most popular and famous songs, one of them being \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\", which were included in \"Dreaming of You\" (1995)."}

It is part of the Golden Circle tour, which is a popular tour that many tourists take. The Golden Circle shows you the national park \u00deingvellir, the waterfall Gullfoss (meaning \"golden falls\"), and the geothermally active valley of Haukadalur, which contains the geysers (erupting hot-springs). In Icelandic, 'Gul' means 'Gold' or 'Golden' and 'Foss' translates into 'Fall'.\nHistory.\nGullfoss and its environments were designed in 1979 as a nature reserve. This served to permanently protect the waterfall and allow the public to enjoy this unique area. The Environment Agency of Iceland is responsible for the management of this reserve.Tourism of this amazing waterfall has been dated to as far back as 1875.In the early days of the last century, Gullfoss was at the centre of much controversy regarding foreign investors and their desire to profit off Iceland\u2019s nature. In the year 1907, an English businessman, Howell, sought to utilise the waterfall\u2019s energy and harboured ambitions to use its energy to fuel a hydroelectric plant.\nAt the time, Gullfoss was owned by a farmer named T\u00f3mas T\u00f3masson. T\u00f3mas declined Howell\u2019s offer to purchase the land, stating famously \u201cI will not sell my friend!\u201d He would, however, go on to lease Howell the land without the knowledge of a loophole that would allow him to proceed with his plans.\nIt was T\u00f3mas\u2019 daughter, Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur T\u00f3masd\u00f3ttir, who would lead the charge to stop Howell\u2019s ambitions. Having grown up on her father\u2019s sheep farm where she helped pave the first road to Gullfoss, she sought to get the contract nullified, hurriedly saving her own money to hire a lawyer.\nThe ensuing legal battle was an uphill struggle; the case continued for years, forcing Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur to travel many times by foot to Reykjav\u00edk, a distance of over 100 kilometres (62 miles). Circumstances became so difficult that Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur threatened to throw herself into the waterfall if any construction began.\nGeography.\nThe gorge was formed by flash flood waters that forced their way through the cracks in the basalt lava layers. On average the water flow is around 110 m3/s. But when these floods happen it can go up to 2000 m3/s, this means that it can fill almost 50 Olympic pools in one minute or about one every second. The floods were so intense that they could fill up the gorge, which is an impressive 32 meters tall, up to the top.\nGullfoss is a tiered Cataract, its total height is 32 m. It has two falls, of which the longest drop is 21 meters tall. It is in the Hvit\u00e1 River in the Southwestern part of Iceland."}

It was written and produced by Keith Thomas. It was for Selena's fifth album \"Dreaming of You\" (1995). The song's lyrics are about a woman who loves a guy. She is scared of rejection so she decides not to tell him and keeps it to herself.\nIt was released in the United States on June 26, 1995 as a promotional recording and not as a CD single. Because of this, it was not eligible for the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. The song was released three months after Selena was killed by her friend and ex-employer of her clothing stores, Yolanda Saldivar. \"I Could Fall in Love\" reached number eight on the US Hot 100 Airplay chart. It reached number one in Canada and the US Latin Pop Airplay chart. \"I Could Fall in Love\" had also reached many other positions on other charts.\nHelped by heavy rotation, \"I Could Fall in Love\" became Selena's most famous songs.

Cuban singer, Gloria Estefan have covered the song during the \"Selena \u00a1VIVE!\" concert held on April 9, 2005.\nRecording and composition.\nSelena, and her brother A.B. Quintanilla III, went to Nashville, Tennessee to see Keith Thomas. Thomas is a music producer and a songwriter who has worked with Amy Grant before. Thomas had introduced himself to both Selena and A.B. He explained to them that he did not add any vocals to the song called \"I Could Fall in Love\". The vocals in a song help singers learn the lyrics quicker. Thomas began singing the introduction of \"I Could Fall in Love\". At that moment, Selena and A.B. had wanted the song to be included in Selena's crossover album. Thomas had given Selena the lyrics so she can memorize it for her recording session. In December 1994, Selena went back to Nashville by herself on a plane. She recorded \"I Could Fall in Love\" that day. Thomas later told \"Biography\", that \"all eyes were on her\". He also said that Selena had no \"ego\" problems and was \"down to-Earth\" (a person who keeps a positive attitude and always acts nice to everyone).\n\"I Could Fall in Love\" is a contemporary R&amp;B, soul and a power ballad. The song is about a women who loves a guy. She is scared to be rejected by him. Because of this, she decides not to tell him. It is composed in C minor with 157 beats per minute. The electronic keyboards, Spanish guitar, and the drums is the song's background music. Selena uses the soprano voice. She has a light-deep voice and uses her emotional voice when she sings the title of the song. Trey Lorenz is the backing vocalist. After Selena sings the chorus, she sings in Spanish during the down-tempo part of the song. She goes back to singing in English. At the end of the song, she uses the melisma technique and hits a high F note.\nRelease and reception.\n\"I Could Fall in Love\" was released as a promotional recording on June 26, 1995 and to radio stations on June 15.

A \"San Jose Mercury News\" writer believed \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" helped Selena to become the new \"Gloria Estefan\". Richard Torres of \"Newsday\" believed \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" became romantic anthems. According to James Hunter of \"Vibe\" magazine, \"I Could Fall in Love\" is a \"masterpiece\". On March 31, 2010, Teresa Jusino of Popmatters wrote that English-speaking music fans no longer knows Selena's name. She also said that if you played \"Dreaming of You\" or \"I Could Fall in Love\", they will most likely say \"I remember that song!\" or \"I love that one!\". \"I Could Fall in Love\" became a popular wedding song after its release. It also became one of Selena's most famous songs. It helped her gain English language speaking fans.\nThe music video for \"I Could Fall in Love\" was released in August 1995. It features pictures and videos of Selena. The music video reached number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Video Monitor VH1 Top Music Videos list.
