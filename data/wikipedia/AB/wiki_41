To do this, ideas from public-key cryptography are used: digital signatures, certificates, and hash codes. An electronic signature often includes a timestamp to show when the signature was made. Much like cryptography, electronic signatures can be used for any kind of data, there is no requirement that the data signed has a specific format. \nEven though cryptography is often used, the term electronic signature has a legal meaning. This is different from the technical term digital signature used in cryptography. Many countries have made regulations so that some electronic signatures are equivalent to a handwritten signature for many purposes. \nThere are different ways in which an electronic signature can be done. Many countries have standards as to what such a signature must look like. Examples for such regulations are eIDAS in the European Union, NIST-DSS in the United States or ZertES in Switzerland.\nAdvanced electronic signature.\nFor an electronic signature to be considered as advanced, it must meet the following requirements:\nQualified electronic signature.\nA qualified electronic signature is an electronic signature that is compliant to EU Regulation No 910/2014 (eIDAS Regulation) for electronic transactions within the internal European market. It enables to verify the authorship of a declaration in electronic data exchange over long periods of time. Qualified electronic signatures can be considered as digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.\nQualified electronic signatures use digital certificates, which are issued by accredited certification authorities. The certtificate and key are stored securely, usually on a smart card. To access the data on the smart card, the user must autenticate himself or herself, usually with a password or piece of biometric data. The certification authority also checked that the user is who he pretends to be, usually cross-checking with an official, state-issued document.\nIn addition to the points listed under \"addvanced electronic signature\", a qualified electronic signature also legally identifies the signer. before the authorities.

The plastic deformation of the metals is made below the recrystallization temperature. In most cases, such cold forming is done at room temperature. The major cold-working operations can be classified basically as squeezing (rolling), bending, shearing and drawing.\nThe cold-working process uses the pressure and speed of a mechanical or hydraulic press. The press takes a metal \u2018blank\u2019 and shapes it using a \u2018punch\u2019 and \u2018die\u2019 set. Basically, the punch is the tool used for shaping, and the \u2018die\u2019 is the clamp that holds the metal. When these metals are cold worked, permanent defects change their crystalline makeup. These defects reduce the ability of crystals to move within the metal structure and the metal becomes more resistant to further deformation. The resulting metal product has improved tensile strength and hardness, but less ductility.\nCold working can be used on a variety of metals, including aluminum, copper, brass, steel, and stainless steel."}

If the output begins to lose this relationship, then the electronics will correct it until the output is returned to the correct phase again. When the phase of an output is steady, then the phase is locked. Each time the phase is measured, the electronics will correct any deviation of the output. Hence, a loop is created which continually corrects the signal."}

It was created by Tony Hoare in 1959, and it is still widely used today. Quicksort splits the array into two parts, and then continues to split those parts into more parts, and sorting along the way. It sorts by using a comparison sort. This means that it chooses a pivot point in a part of the array and then compares it with all the other points in that part of the array.\nAlgorithm.\nOften the leftmost item is chosen as the pivot. The recursion means that the algorithm runs the same exact algorithm on the two partitions that were created by the comparisons to the pivot. Note that this algorithm will keep on partitioning the array into subarrays, and splitting those subarrays into even smaller subarrays. Each time it does this, it will choose a new pivot within the subarray and compare the items to the subarray. The base case is when the algorithm reaches a subarray with only one item, in which it just stops because one item does not need to be sorted."}

By the end of the 20th century, 75 to 80 percent of Americans had performed vaginal intercourse before age 19.\nA 2011 study looked at young adults. It found that men said they had fewer negative and more positive emotional reactions. Women said condom use had fewer positive and more negative reactions. But cohort studies over 23 years found that in later years, women had greater pleasure and less guilt."}

Sancho Garc\u00e9s was responsible for bringing his kingdom into the political orbit of Europe. He was the eldest son of Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, \"the Restorer\" and Margaret of L'Aigle.\nBiography.\nSancho VI inherited a debilitated kingdom, subject of frequent raids by the Kingdom of Castile of Alfonso VII and by the County of Barcelona of Ramon Berenguer IV, also king of Aragon, who in 1140 had agreed the partition of the kingdom in the Treaty of Carri\u00f3n.\nHe tried to repair the borders of his kingdom, which had been reduced by the Treaties of Tudej\u00e9n and Carri\u00f3n, which he had been forced to sign with Castile and Arag\u00f3n in his early reign. By the Accord of Soria, Castile was eventually confirmed in its possession of conquered territories. In the face of a possible Castilian military takeover of further western Navarrese territories, Sancho VI re-asserted royal authority by founding several towns in 1181, including San Sebasti\u00e1n, Vitoria and Trevi\u00f1o, among others.\nHe was hostile to Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, but Raymond's son King Alfonso II of Aragon divided the lands taken from Murcia with him by treaty of Sang\u00fcesa in 1168. In 1190, the two neighbours again signed a pact in Borja of mutual protection against Castilian expansion.\nHe died on 27 June 1194, in Pamplona, where he is buried."}

{"id": "683357", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=683357", "title": "Analytic language", "text": "An analytic language is a language that organizes words and grammar by a strict word order instead of inflections, or word endings that show grammar. Examples of analytic languages include Chinese, English, Vietnamese, Thai, Khmer, and Lao. \nIn Chinese, sentences are mostly in the SVO (subject-verb-object) word order. So the sentence must be \"I eat noodles\", not \"I noodles eat\" or \"eat I noodles\". In Chinese this is written as \u6211\u5403\u9762\u6761. The verb \u5403 (pronounced \"ch\u012b,\" meaning: \"eat\") does not change based on the subject \"I\" or the object \"noodles\", and likewise the subject \u6211 (pronounced \"w\u01d2,\" meaning: \"I\") and object \u9762\u6761 (pronounced \"mi\u00e0nti\u00e1o,\" meaning: \"noodle/noodles\") do not have any special word endings based on its role or number. What is important is that all the words are in the correct order. \nModern English does have some inflections based on the subject (the verb \"eat\" becomes \"eats\" when the subject is a third person \"he/she/it\") and number (\"noodle\" is singular while \"noodles\" is plural), but aside from that, there are almost none. Therefore, Modern English is mostly an analytic language. Modern English has far fewer inflections that almost all other Indo-European languages, such as Spanish, German, and Russian. \nOld English was an inflectional language and content words could have several different word endings, much like German today. However, England was taken over by speakers of other languages, especially French, Danish, and Latin, and since the new rulers became second language speakers of English, the grammar simplified to what it is today."}

Not only did speakers of East Asian languages learn to by write using Chinese characters, but they also borrowed many loanwords from Chinese as well.\nLinguists used to believe that languages like Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Turkish, and Finnish were part of the Altaic language family. This was because of similar features like SVO (subject-verb-object) word order and agglutinating grammar. However, most linguists no longer believe that the Altaic language family ever existed.

At the end of the meeting, around 3:00 pm, the 125 members present voted to go on strike starting at midnight.\nThree union members-H\u00e9ctor Escudero Aponte, Jos\u00e9 Rivera L\u00f3pez and Arnaldo Jim\u00e9nez-planned setting several fires. They wanted to scare tourists who stayed at the hotel. At around 3:30 pm that afternoon, they placed opened cans of chafing fuel in a storage room with newly bought furniture. The three men then set the fuel on fire.\nThe fire quickly burned out of control. It grew very large as the building burned. \nAftermath.\nAn investigation by the United States' Occupational Safety and Health Administration found 25 safety violations. They included not having emergency exit doors in the casino area. That caused the deaths of 84 trapped guests. \nIn April 1987, Escuerdo Apante, 35, Jim\u00e9nez Rivera, 29, and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Rivera L\u00f3pez, 40, pleaded guilty to setting the New Year's Eve fire. They were also convicted of murder in the disaster. Two of the men were later released from federal prison."}

It is a Marxist\u2013Leninist communist party. The Cuban constitution describes the role of the party to be the \"leading force of society and of the state\". Since April 2011, the First Secretary of the Central Committee has been Ra\u00fal Castro, younger brother of the previous First Secretary Fidel Castro, who died on 25 November 2016. The Second Secretary has been Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura.\nHistory.\nCuba had a number of communist and anarchist organizations from the early period of the Republic. The original \"internationalised\" Communist Party of Cuba formed in the 1920s. In 1944, it was renamed as the Popular Socialist Party for electoral reasons. In July 1961, two years after the successful overthrow of Fulgencio Batista and the creation of a revolutionary government, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI) was formed. It was a merger of:\nOn 26 March 1962, the ORI became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC), which became the Communist Party of Cuba on 3 October 1965. In Article 5 of the Cuban constitution of 1976, the Communist Party is recognized as \"the superior guiding force of society and of the State, that organizes and orients common efforts toward the high goals of the construction of socialism and the advancement toward communist society\". All parties, including the Communist Party, are prohibited from advertizing their organizations.\nFor the first fifteen years of its existence, the Communist Party was almost completely inactive outside of the Politburo. The 100 person Central Committee rarely met and the first regular party Congress was held ten years after its founding. In 1969, membership of the party was only 55,000 (0.7% of the population), making the PCC the smallest ruling communist party in the world. By the time of the first party Congress in 1975, the party had grown to just over two hundred thousand members. By 1980, the party had grown to over 430,000 members and it grew further to 520,000 by 1985.\nCentral Committee.\nThe leading bodies of the party were the Politburo and the Secretariat until 1991. In 1991 the two bodies were merged into an expanded Politburo with over twenty members. However, the Secretariat was re-introduced in 2002. There is also a Central Committee which meets between party congresses. At the Fifth Congress, the size of the Central Committee was reduced to 150 members from the previous membership of 225. Fidel Castro was the party's First Secretary (or leader) since its creation while Ra\u00fal Castro was the Second Secretary. Upon Fidel Castro's 2008 resignation from the party and Cuban government, Ra\u00fal Castro became First Secretary.\nPolitburo.\nThe 7th Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba was elected by the Central Committee on 19 April 2016 following the 7th Congress.\nYouth.\nThe Communist Party of Cuba has a youth wing, the Young Communist League (\"Uni\u00f3n de J\u00f3venes Comunistas\", UJC) which is a member organization of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. It also has a children's group, the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Pioneer Organization.\nIdeology.\nCompared with other ruling Communist Parties, the Communist Party of Cuba retains a stricter adherence to the tradition of Marxism\u2013Leninism and the traditional Soviet model."}

Somebody with this fetish enjoys either hitting a man in the testicles, or being hit in the testicles. The genre is also referred to as ballbusting (\"bb\" for short). Tamakeri is the Japanese term, but it is used by many non-Japanese people to describe media where Asian women hit men in the testicles. In tamakeri, there are two types of people: the sadist and the masochist. The sadist hits the man in the testicles, and the masochist is hit in the testicles. The fetish is popular among straight and gay men and women. Since the Internet was created, the amount of people watching tamakeri pornography has gone up, with at least 1,269,105 people looking at popular websites. In hentai communities, it can be called either \"tamakeri\", or \"crotch_kick\".\nHistory.\nFirst wave (1990s\u20132001).\nThe first tamakeri/ballbusting websites to show up on the internet were Velvet Kick, Tamahimeden, Spikey Step, Stardeck9, and Femaledom. Most of their videos had bad quality, didn't make money, had no stories, and had regular people with masks performing.\nSecond wave (2002\u20132005).\nAfter the first websites came ones like British Bitches, Vuneraballs, M-Club-Q, Kinkeri.co.jp, USBBonline, Goddess-Kicks, Ballbusting Universe, and Ballbustingworld. These sites had better quality, more money, more content, stories, and known actors that didn't wear masks. Even though the majority of videos had known porn actors, many still decided to wear masks.\nThird and current wave (2006\u2013present).\nThe current tamakeri websites have videos made by normal people, paid actors, and videos taken at events. Because these new websites are larger, more people can post their own videos. Also, chatrooms and forums allow people to discuss the fetish with others. Some examples of this latest tamakeri wave include ClubDom, Ballbustingtube, Ballbustingchicks, clips4sale, kickedinthegroin.ning.com, Scaffies.nl, Tamakeri.nl and ProtectUrNuts.com.\nCause.\nPeople enjoy tamakeri because they either feel good feeling pain or making others feel it. The feeling is like a \"runner's high\", where feel-good hormones called endorphins are sent out by the body. These endorphins make the people involved feel sexually aroused. But some people say that threats and more painful kicks or knees to the testicles by the female (in straight people) makes people more aroused. Belonging to a dominant boyfriend or girlfriend can also be a \"turn-on\". Like a lot of BDSM activities, it can be risky, and those involved can get hurt.\nReferences.\nBALL STRETCHER"}

The ink travels by a combination of gravity and capillary action. The nib is the part of the pen that writes on the paper. Different shapes and styles of nibs can change the amount of ink distributed and the thickness of your writing line. Most fountain pens have replaceable nibs. They can come in many different materials and styles and are ranked from extra-fine to extra broad. \nFilling the reservoir with ink may be done manually, by a Pasteur pipette (eyedropper) or syringe. \nHowever, usually it is done by an internal filling mechanism which creates suction. A piston mechanism or a vacuum transfers ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens have removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.\nNibs.\nAccording to Mathur \"the modern fountain pen nib may be traced back to the original gold nib which had a tiny fragment of ruby attached to form the wear-point\". Nibs tipped with platinum group alloys such as iridium have been used since the 1830s. Today, the main part of the nib are usually made of stainless steel and/or gold The most popular gold content is 14 carat (58\u2153%) and 18 carat (75%). The idea is that the nib should be flexible yet firm, and the tip extremely hard-wearing.\nInk reservoir.\nUntil the early 20th century, the ink in a fountain pen was kept directly in the barrel. The slim barrels were made of hard rubber, which came in two colours, black and red. Ink was put in these barrels with an eye-dropper. To do this, the user had to take off the nib section, put the ink in and replace the nib section. This operation required a quiet secluded place, which some people might not have.\nIn 1907, Walter A. Sheaffer patented the lever filler. This used a hinged lever set into the pen barrel which pressed down onto a bar which in turn compressed a rubber sac inside, creating a vacuum which pulled ink into the pen. This could be done without removing the nib section.\nIntroduced in 1912, this innovation was rapidly imitated by the other major pen makers. Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap on the end of the barrel. When pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac. Many other firms used a lever set flat along the barrel, which, when pulled, squeezed the rubber sac. It was the rubber sac which made all the difference between the founain pens of the 19th century and those of the 20th century. Other firms used a screw mechanism at the top end of the pen to squeeze the rubber sac. This made the pen look more elegant."}

At least 51 people were killed and 49 others injured by gunman Brenton Tarrant in the shootings. It was described as a terrorist attack by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.\nPolice have also confirmed that they had found multiple car bombs, which were successfully disarmed. This was the first mass shooting in New Zealand since the 1997 Raurimu massacre.\nAustralian Brenton Tarrant was arrested and charged with murder. Tarrant live streamed one of the attacks on Facebook Live. Tarrant pleaded guilty to the murders in March 2020 and was sentenced to prison with no parole.\nAttacks.\nAl Noor Mosque, Riccarton.\nTarrant began to shoot worshippers in the Al Noor Mosque at around 13:40. Between 300 and 500 people could have been in the mosque during Friday prayers when the shooting happened. Someone who lived nearby said the shooter ran from the mosque and dropped a gun. They also said that the man was wearing military-style clothes.\nTarrant live streamed the first 17 minutes of the attack on Facebook live. The stream showed the whole attack on the Al Noor Mosque, and finished as he was driving to the Linwood Islamic Centre. The first victim of the shooting could be heard greeting the shooter on the stream by saying \"Hello, brother\", who was killed straight after. The shooter was at the mosque for six minutes before driving away. Police were told about the attack at 1:53\u00a0p.m.\nLinwood Islamic Centre.\nA second attack happened at around 1:55\u00a0p.m. at the Linwood Islamic Centre. It is a mosque away from the Al Noor Mosque. Seven people were killed there.\nThe mosque's imam said that a person called Abdul Aziz stopped the attack before Tarrant could get into the building. He grabbed a credit card machine and threw it at the attacker. Tarrant then shot at Aziz, who picked up an empty shotgun on the floor and threw it through the window of Tarrant's car. Tarrant then drove away.\nExplosive devices.\nThe police found two improvised explosive devices in a car. They were defused by the New Zealand Defence Force and did not explode.\nResponse.\nIn response to the shootings, Jacinda Ardern announced that the New Zealand government will be introducing stronger firearms regulations. She said that the Christchurch mosque attacks has lead to her to see many major weaknesses in New Zealand's gun law. On 10 April 2019, less than one month after the attack, the New Zealand Parliament passed a law that bans most semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, parts that convert guns into semiautomatic guns, and higher capacity magazines.\nOn 15 May 2019, Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron co-chaired the Christchurch Call summit. The aim of this summit was to \"bring together countries and tech companies in an attempt to bring to an end the ability to use social media to organise and promote terrorism and violent extremism\". This means she is trying to tell the world's technology companies to take serious measures to actively prevent the internet's social media from promoting terrorism and violent extremism."}

The West German territory was an enclave separated from the rest of the country by a strip of Swiss land about 200 to 300 metres wide. \nIn 1522, Emperor Charles V and his brother Archduke Ferdinand of Austria bought Verenahof at the same time when they bought other small pieces of land in the same region (Tengen, Kommingen, Wiechs am Randen) from Count .\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries there were arguments between Tengen and Schaffhausen about access roads and the exact border of the enclave.\nIn 1964 West Germany and Switzerland agreed that Verenahof would become part of Switzerland. This happened on 4 October 1967. Today Verenahof is part of the village of B\u00fcttenhardt.\nAt the Wiechs am Randen town hall there are some remaining border markers that became no longer needed with the land swap in 1967.

The long scale is based on powers of one million (1,000,000), whereas the short scale is based on powers of one thousand (1,000). \nFor whole numbers less than a thousand million (&lt; 109), the two scales are the same. From a thousand million up (\u2265 109), the two scales differ ever more, using the same words for different numbers, which can cause misunderstanding.\nShort scale.\nEvery next short \"-illion\" word greater than \"million\" is one thousand times as large as the previous term. Thus, a short:\n\"billion\" (109) means \"a thousand million\",\n\"trillion\" (1012) means a \"thousand\u00a0billion\",\n\"quadrillion\" (1015) means a \"thousand trillion\", and so on. Thus, a short \"n\"-illion equals 103\"n\"\u2009+\u20093.\nLong scale.\nEvery next long \"-illion\" word greater than \"million\" is one million times as large as the previous term. So, the long:\n\"billion\" (1012) means a \"million million\",\n\"trillion\" (1018) means a \"million billion\",\n\"quadrillion\" (1024) means a \"million trillion\" and so on. Thus, a long \"n\"-illion equals 106\"n\".\nEvery \"-illiard\" word is one thousand times as large as the previous \"-illion\" word. So:\n\"milliard\" (109) means a \"thousand million\",\n\"billiard\" (1015) means a \"thousand billion\",\n\"trilliard\" (1021) means a \"thousand trillion\" and so on. Thus, a long \"n\"-illiard equals 106\"n\"+3.\nUse.\nCountries where the long scale is currently used include most countries in continental Europe and most that are French-speaking, Spanish-speaking (except Spanish-speakers born into an English-speaking culture, e.g. Puerto Rico, because of its influence from English-speaking United States) and Portuguese-speaking countries, except Brazil.\nThe short scale is now used in most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, in Brazil, in the former Soviet Union and several other countries.\nNumber names are rendered in the language of the country, but are similar everywhere due to shared etymology. Some languages, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, have large-number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales, as for example the Indian numbering system.\nFor most of the 19th and 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely used the long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so that the two systems were often referred to as \"British\" and \"American\" in the English language. After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short scale, in 1974 the government of the UK adopted it, and it is used for all official purposes. With very few exceptions, the British usage and American usage are now the same.\nThe first recorded use of the words \"short scale\" () and \"long scale\" () was by the French mathematician Genevi\u00e8ve Guitel in 1975.\nTo lessen the confusion from the use of both short and long terms in any language, the SI recommends using the Metric prefix, which keeps the same meaning regardless of the country and the language. Long and short scales remain in use for counting money."}

It is located about 20 light years away in the Libra. It is about six times as massive as Earth, and circles its star about 11 million kilometers from it (the Earth is 150 million kilometers away from the sun). It takes it 13 days to circle the star once. When it was discovered in 2007, it was thought to be Earth-like and habitable. \nHabitability.\nGliese 581 c was thought to be habitable when it was discovered, and it was thought to be in the habitable zone. However, later studies by the von Bloh team said that Gliese 581 c circled too close to the star to be in the habitable zone. Gliese 581 c may also suffer a serve greenhouse effect, making it as hot as Venus. If that is true, it is uninhabitable. Also, red dwarfs like Gliese 581 are not very friendly to life as we know it, since they are very stellar active (meaning they emit strong solar flares and such).\nTidal locking.\nGliese 581 c may be tidally locked to its star. Just as one side of the Moon always faces Earth, the length of Gliese 581 c's day would then match the length of its year. Tidal locking also means the planet would have no axial tilt and that means the planet would not experience any seasons. Even with a permanent day one one side, and a permanent night on one side, a sliver of land between the two zones may be habitable."}

The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) was a split form the Democratic domain of the Barbados Labour Party In 1955. However, as a result of this common orgin, the two parties have been and is still remaining until today, ideologically similar and has similar believes about governing the affairs of Barbados.

He is known by many to be one of the best pianists alive today. Born in Gala\u021bi, Romania, Lupu began learning piano when he was six years old. Two of his major piano teachers were Florica Musicescu, who was also the teacher of Dinu Lipatti, and Heinrich Neuhaus, who was also the teacher of Sviatoslav Richter and Emil Gilels. From 1966 to 1969, he won First Prizes of three of the world's most famous piano competitions: the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition (1966), the George Enescu International Piano Competition (1967), and the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition (1969). These victories started Lupu's career all over the world and he has appeared with all of the famous orchestras and at all of the famous festivals and music capitals of the world.\nFrom 1970 to 1993, Lupu made over 20 recordings for Decca Records; although he has not released any commercial recordings for the label since, he continues to be an exclusive Decca artist. His solo recordings, which have received a lot of acclaim, include works by Beethoven, Brahms, Grieg, Mozart, Schubert, and Schumann, including all of Beethoven's piano concertos as well as five piano sonatas and other solo works; the Grieg and Schumann piano concertos, as well as three major solo works of Schumann; nine piano sonatas and the Impromptus and Moments musicaux of Schubert; various major solo works and the first piano concerto of Brahms; and two piano concertos of Mozart. His chamber music recordings for Decca include all of Mozart's sonatas for violin and piano with Szymon Goldberg; the violin sonatas of Debussy and Franck with Kyung Wha Chung; and various works by Schubert for violin and piano with Goldberg. He additionally recorded works of Mozart and Schubert for piano four-hands and two pianos with Murray Perahia for CBS Masterworks, two albums of Schubert songs with Barbara Hendricks for EMI, and a disc of works by Schubert for piano four-hands with Daniel Barenboim for Teldec.\nIn addition to his performances of the music of Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, Schubert, and Schumann, Lupu is also noted for his performances of Bart\u00f3k, Debussy, Enescu, and Jan\u00e1\u010dek, among other composers. Lupu was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning one in 1995 for an album of two Schubert piano sonatas. In 1995, Lupu also won an Edison Award for a disc of three major piano works of Schumann. Other awards won by Lupu include the Abbiati prize awarded by the Italian Critics' Association in 1989 and 2006, and the 2006 Premio Internazionale Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli award.\nLife and career.\nEarly life and education.\nLupu was born in Gala\u021bi, Romania on 30 November 1945, the son of Meyer Lupu, an attorney, and Ana Gabor, a linguist. From his earliest days, Lupu \"had always expressed himself by singing\", and was given his first piano at the age of 5. He began piano studies in 1951, as a six-year-old, with Lia Busuioceanu. He made his public debut in 1957, at age 12, in a concert featuring his own compositions. He told \"The Christian Science Monitor\" in 1970 that \"from the very beginning I regarded myself as a composer. I was sure, and everybody else was sure, that one day I would become a famous composer\". He gave up composing about four years later, saying that he thought he would be \"much better as a pianist\".\nAfter completing high school in Gala\u021bi, and graduating from the Popular School for the Arts in Bra\u0219ov, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with Victor Bickerich, Lupu continued his piano studies at the Bucharest Conservatory (1959\u20131961) with Florica Musicescu (who also taught Dinu Lipatti), and Cella Delavrancea, studying also composition with Dragos Alexandrescu. At the age of 16, in 1961, he was awarded a scholarship to the Moscow P.I. Tchaikovsky State Conservatory, where he studied for seven years. In Moscow, he first studied with Galina Eguiazarova (a pupil of Alexander Goldenweiser) for two years, and then with Heinrich Neuhaus (who also taught Sviatoslav Richter and Emil Gilels) and later with his son, Stanislav Neuhaus. He graduated in 1969. However, in a 1981 interview, when asked about what types of influences his teachers had on him, Lupu answered that he thought of himself as more audodidactic: \"My first teacher took me to every orchestral concert, and I am also grateful for what I learned in Moscow, but I think of myself, basically (in music anyway), as somebody who is more autodidactic. I took some from Furtw\u00e4ngler, Toscanini, everywhere...more and more so since I left Moscow.\"\nEarly career.\nIn 1965, Lupu was placed fifth at the International Beethoven Piano Competition in Vienna. The following year, Lupu won the First Prize in the Second Van Cliburn International Piano Competition; he also won special prizes for the Best Performance of a Commissioned Work (of Willard Straight's \"Structure for Piano\") and the Best Performance of a movement from the Aaron Copland Piano Sonata. In the finals, his performance of the first movement of Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2 (Op. 16), a required piece, was described by Paul Hume of The Washington Post as \"the most fiery and thunderous of any of the six finalists\". In addition to the Prokofiev, he performed Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Op. 73). Alicia de Larrocha, who was on the jury, said that Lupu was a genius. \"I did not expect it at all. I am just speechless,\" Lupu said after his victory. Shortly after the competition, in April 1967, Lupu made his debut at Carnegie Hall in New York City where he played pieces by Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin. However, Lupu didn't do many of the other performances that came with the prize, instead choosing to return to Moscow to continue learning.\nA year after his Cliburn Competition victory, in 1967, Lupu won the first prize in the George Enescu International Piano Competition. Two years later, in October 1969, he won the Leeds International Piano Competition; he performed Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3 (Op. 37) in the Finals. The following month, in November 1969, Lupu played his first solo concert in London; Joan Chissell of \"The Times\" wrote about his performance of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 7 at the recital: \"He brought what seemed like a lifetime's experience to its alternating desolation and pride. Never could music come nearer to speech.\"\nIn March and April 1970, Lupu made his first recording for Decca Records of Brahms' Rhapsody in B minor (Op. 79 No. 1) and Three Intermezzi (Op. 117), as well as Schubert's Piano Sonata in A minor (D. 784). He has remained an exclusive Decca artist, and continued to record for the label for the following 23 years. In August 1970, the 24-year-old pianist made his debut at The Proms, performing Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1 (Op. 15) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Edo de Waart at the Royal Albert Hall. In November 1970, he made his first concerto recording for Decca, of the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 3 with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster; he also recorded Beethoven's 32 Variations in C minor (WoO 80).\nLupu's first major concerts in the United States after his Leeds Competition victory were in February 1972 with the Cleveland Orchestra, in the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 with Daniel Barenboim conducting at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and in October 1972 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 3 with Carlo Maria Giulini conducting. The performance of the Brahms with the Cleveland Orchestra and Barenboim was reviewed by Harold C. Schonberg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic for \"The New York Times\" who had ten years prior notably lambasted the famous New York Philharmonic concert of April 6, 1962 where the same concerto was played by Glenn Gould with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Schonberg was also critical of the performance by Lupu and Barenboim, writing that not since the Bernstein-Gould performance \"had there been such an interpretation\" of the concerto, describing it as \"willful, episodic and mannered, self-indulgent, capricious\". However, he added that \"yet through all the eccentricities came the feeling of two young musicians trying hard to get out of the rut and once in a while actually succeeding\", but that \"in future years this kind of approach may jell for them. Right now it does not come off.\"\nGrowing acclaim.\nAlthough Schonberg had been critical of Lupu's debut with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Barenboim in February 1972, he was far more enthusiastic of Lupu's performance in November 1972 of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster at Carnegie Hall, writing, in \"The New York Times\", that \"his performance did much to redeem the impression he had made last season in the Brahms D minor Concerto. Then he sounded mannered, finicky, artificial. This time he was a different pianist.\" Schonberg added:The following year, Lupu recorded the piano concertos of Schumann (Op. 54) and Grieg (Op. 16) with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andr\u00e9 Previn, a recording described by \"Gramophone\" as \"grandly commanding\". In February 1974, Lupu performed a recital at Hunter College in New York, which was raved by John Rockwell of \"The New York Times\". Rockwell declared Lupu \"no ordinary pianist\" and wrote about Lupu's performance of Schubert's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (D. 960):In November 1974, Lupu made his debut with the New York Philharmonic, performing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 (K. 467) conducted by James Conlon. In 1975, Lupu debuted with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and gave the premiere of the Andr\u00e9 Tchaikowsky Piano Concerto, Op. 4 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Uri Segal at the Royal Festival Hall. In 1976, Lupu recorded Brahms' 6 Klavierst\u00fccke (Op. 118) and 4 Klavierst\u00fccke (Op. 119), which was described by \"Stereo Review\" as \"a glowing realization of what Brahms set down that leaves one at a loss for words and simply glad to have ears.\" In 1978, he gave his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Herbert von Karajan at that year's Salzburg Festival. Reviewing a recital Lupu gave at Avery Fisher Hall in 1980, Andrew Porter of The New Yorker hailed Lupu as \"a master of the most satisfying kind\". By 1981 he had played with every major orchestra.\nRemainder of the 20th century.\nIn June 1982, Lupu made a critically acclaimed recording of Schubert's Impromptus (D. 899 &amp; 935). John Rockwell wrote in \"The New York Times\" that Lupu's \"singing tone here must be heard to be believed. Without belittling the other facets of Schubert's musical personality, he captures the composer's songful essence with a rare beauty - and, in so doing, he reaffirms once more the ability of present-day performers to do ample justice to the music of the past.\" In addition, \"Gramophone\" said about the recording:In 1989, Lupu was awarded the \"Abbiati\" prize by the Italian Critics' Association. In 1995, he won an Edison Award for his album of Schumann's \"Kinderszenen\" (Op. 15), \"Kreisleriana\" (Op. 16) and \"Humoreske\" (Op. 20) which was also nominated for a Grammy Award. In the Grammy Awards of 1996, he won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) for Schubert's Piano Sonatas in B-flat major (D. 960) and A major (D. 664).\n21st century.\nIn 2006, Lupu was awarded the Premio Internazionale Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and in 2016 was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music.\nMusical style.\nLupu uses a regular, straight-backed chair at the piano as opposed to a standard piano bench. He told \"Clavier\" in 1981 that while sitting on a bench he tended to lean forward, raise his shoulders, become impossibly stiff and develop pains all over. He also said that he practiced with a chair at home and found it natural for him. Although Lupu is an admirer of the pianism of Arthur Rubinstein and Vladimir Horowitz, he named Mieczys\u0142aw Horszowski as having the most influence on his playing, saying that Horszowski \"speaks to me like no one else\". Lupu's initial approach to new music is to read it away from the piano, saying that he \"reads more easily away from the instrument\" and that \"it is the only way to learn\". Lupu says in regards to tone production that \"everything in music comes from the head', adding: \"If you have any concept of sound, you hear it in your inner ear. All you have to work for is to match that sound on the instrument. The whole balance, the line, the tone, is perceived and controlled by the head.\" He further describes tone production as a \"matching process for which [one] practices\", and the physical contact of the keyboard as \"a very individual thing determined by the color or timbre you hear and try to get, the piece you are playing, the phrase\".\nLupu's playing has garnered admiration not only from music critics, but also by fellow major artists. Mitsuko Uchida told Humphrey Burton in a 2002 BBC Radio 3 interview that \"there is nobody on earth who can actually get certain range of colour, and also the control - don't underestimate this unbelievable control of his playing.\" Nikolai Lugansky said in an interview that Lupu \"possesses the rare power of letting the music speak for itself\", and Andr\u00e1s Schiff stated that Lupu has the \"rare gift to illuminate anything that he plays with rare musical intelligence\". Other pianists who have expressed admiration for Lupu or cite him as an inspiration in their music-making include Emanuel Ax, Daniel Barenboim, Seong-Jin Cho (who named Lupu's recording of the Schubert Impromptus as his favorite), Kirill Gerstein, Stephen Hough, Robert Levin, Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires, and Daniil Trifonov. In addition, the conductor Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin cites Lupu as an inspiration while he was a piano student, saying that listening to recitals and recordings by Lupu \"shaped my conception of sound from a very young age\", and the cellist Steven Isserlis called him \"one of the greatest artists I have ever heard or known\".\nRepertoire and recordings.\nIn the span of 23 years, Lupu made over 20 recordings for Decca Records, and continues to be an exclusive Decca artist. His first recording was made in the spring of 1970. Lupu's solo recordings, which have received considerable acclaim, include works by Beethoven, Brahms, Grieg, Mozart, Schubert, and Schumann. His solo recordings without orchestra include 5 Beethoven piano sonatas (Opp. 13, 27/2, 49, and 53), as well as Beethoven's two rondos for piano (Op. 51) and 32 Variations in C minor; Brahms' Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor (Op. 5), Two Rhapsodies (Op. 79), Intermezzi (Op. 117), 6 Pieces for Piano (Op. 118) and 4 Pieces for Piano (Op. 119); nine piano sonatas of Schubert (D. 157, 557, 664, 784, 845, 894, 958, 959, 960) as well as the Impromptus (D. 899, 935) and Moments musicaux (D. 780); and Schumann's Humoreske (Op. 20), Kinderszenen (Op. 15) and Kreisleriana (Op. 16). His concerto recordings include the complete cycle of Beethoven piano concertos with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta; the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 (Op. 15) with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Edo de Waart; the Grieg and Schumann piano concertos with the London Symphony Orchestra and Andr\u00e9 Previn; and two Mozart piano concertos (K. 414 and 467) with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Uri Segal. His chamber music recordings for Decca include all of Mozart's sonatas for violin and piano with Szymon Goldberg; the violin sonatas of Debussy and Franck with Kyung Wha Chung; the quintets for piano and winds of Beethoven (Op. 16) and Mozart (K. 452) with Han de Vries, George Pieterson, Vicente Zarzo, and Brian Pollard; and various works by Schubert for violin and piano with Goldberg. He additionally recorded works of Mozart and Schubert for piano four-hands and two pianos with Murray Perahia for the CBS Masterworks, two albums of Schubert songs with Barbara Hendricks for EMI, and a disc of works by Schubert for piano four-hands with Daniel Barenboim for Teldec.\nPersonal life.\nLupu's first wife was the cellist Elizabeth Wilson (born 1947), daughter of diplomat Sir (Archibald) Duncan Wilson, whom he married in 1971. He currently resides in Lausanne, Switzerland with his current wife Delia, a violinist in the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne.\nFor most of his career, Lupu has regularly refused to grant interviews to the press out of \"fear of being misunderstood or misquoted\". His aversion to the press and publicity has prompted them to label him as \"the reclusive Radu Lupu\", with \"The Independent\" referring to him as a \"woolly recluse\" and \"like someone dragged unwillingly into the concert hall but asked to leave his begging-bowl outside.\" In addition, Lupu usually does not allow radio broadcasts of his performances. In 1994, \"Chicago Tribune\" noted that Lupu's press kit then contained one single interview he granted to the \"Clavier\" magazine in 1981. Other published interviews include a \"conversation\" that Lupu granted to \"Clavier\" in 1992 and an interview from 1975 that was aired on BBC Radio 3."}

The different word is its hyperonym, hypernym or superordinate term. Hyponymy is a relation to a more generic word. A hyponym can be part of a group of words on a similar level that can all be replaced by the same hypernym. For example, \"pigeon\", \"crow\", \"eagle\" and \"seagull\" are all hyponyms (co-hyponyms) of \"bird\" (their hypernym). In turn, bird is a hyponym of \"animal\". In a sentence such as 'The pigeon is flying over the church.', it is possible to change the word pigeon to \"bird\" or \"animal\" without changing the overall meaning of the sentence. This is because \"pigeon\" is a hyponym of both \"bird\" and \"animal\". \nA hypernym is sometimes also called an umbrella term or a blanket term. \nThe word Hyponym comes from the Greek \"hup\u00f3\", \"under\" and \"\u00f3noma\", \"name\". Hypernym comes from the Greek \"hup\u00e9r\", \"over\" and \"\u00f3noma\", \"name\". A hyponym can also sometimes be a phrase. A word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym.\nUsage.\nIn Computer science this relationship is often called an \"is-a\" relationship. For example, the phrase 'Red is-a colour' describes the hyponymic relationship between \"red\" and \"colour\".\nThe idea of hyponymy is very important in language translation. This is because hyponyms are very common across languages. For example, in Japanese the word for 'older brother' is , and the word for 'younger brother' is . An English-to-Japanese translator needs to choose which Japanese word to use to translate the English word \"brother\". This can be difficult during machine translation because this information is often not available."}

It can happen for several different reasons, like fixing a plot hole or getting rid of a detail that was disliked by many people. \nThere are a few main types of retcons. \nThe first is addition. This is a new detail added to give the reader or viewer a new understanding of the story. This detail would not have been planned when a series was first being made. For example, many people who watched complained that the Death Star had an easily spotted and poorly placed weak point. This made it easier to be destroyed. George Lucas, the writer of Star Wars, did not have an explanation why. However, the writers of its prequel, Rogue One, later explained this. They wrote the story so that character Galen Erso, who is the main character Jyn Erso's father, made its weak point easily seen and poorly placed on purpose. He did this so he could help the Rebel Alliance destroy it. \nThe second is alteration. This is a detail goes against details already given. This is called a contradiction. For example, in , the villain Revolver Ocelot tells the main character Solid Snake that Big Boss was in his late fifties when he gave his genes to make clones. This was the year 1972. However, in the prequel Metal Gear Solid 3, Big Boss is the main character. The game is set in 1964, but Big Boss is nowhere even close to being in his late forties or early fifties, which is how old he is supposed to be. \nThe third is subtraction. This is a detail that gets ignored or forgotten later in a series. For example, in the movie , the villain Colonel Stryker experiments on the superhero Deadpool and turns him into Weapon 11. This made fans of Deadpool so unhappy that when the Deadpool movie came out it completely ignored the story given in X-Men Origins."}

A contradiction in logic can also be used to denote a self-contradictory statement, in which case it sometimes denoted by the symbol formula_1 or formula_2.\nA story that shows what a contradiction is comes from China. In this story, there is a merchant who sells both spears and shields. He says that his spears are so sharp that they could break through any shield. At the same time, he says that his shields are so strong that they could block any spear. This is a contradiction, because these two statements cannot both be true. Either spear will break the shield or the shield will block the spear, but not both. For this reason, the word for contradiction in Chinese is \"m\u00e1od\u00f9n\" (\u77db\u76fe), which literally means \"spear and shield\".\nIn Aristotle's logic, it is said that two contradictory propositions cannot both be true. For example, the propositions \"A is B\" and \"A is not B\" are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one, and not both, can be true. For example, the statements \"the Pope is Catholic\" and \"the Pope is not Catholic\" cannot both be true. Only one of the statements, and not the other, is true. "}

They are the main villains in the first three Star Wars movies. It is ruled by Darth Sidious and enforced by his apprentice, Darth Vader. The Empire rules the galaxy by creating fear and using violence. It is a totalitarian government, which means it controls every part of the people's lives. It uses its military to kill or silence anyone who does not agree with its rule.\nThe Empire was created because Darth Sidious overthrew the Galactic Republic by starting the Clone Wars. Before the war started, many planets and star systems left the Republic to create their own government and army, the Separatists. Many people in the Republic were scared of the Separatists, so they voted to give emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the public identity of Darth Sidious. This was because he was well-liked and they believed he was a strong leader. By the end of he war, Sidious could create any law he wanted. The only ones who could stop him were the Jedi, a very old group of knights who swore to protect the Republic. They tried to arrest him, but they failed. Sidious used this as an excuse to create a government with much more security. He made the Republic into the Empire, and made himself Emperor.\nThe Empire killed many people and aliens. Paying its large military made the galaxy poor. It took away almost all freedoms and rights people had under the Republic. It had a lot of corruption. Life was so terrible under the Empire that some of its governors and officials tried to talk to the Empire's leaders, but they were threatened. \nTherefore, many people and aliens joined the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Empire and bring back the Republic.\nAfter the deaths of both Darth Vader and the Emperor and the Empire's loss on the Battle of Jakku, the Empire surrendered to the Rebel Alliance. The Rebels then created the New Republic. The Empire may have surrendered, but some of the Empire's leaders who were still alive created a new military based on the Empire, the First Order. They rebuilt by buying weapons and spaceships from greedy merchants in the Outer Rim and taking over planets with many resources they could use to buy more weapons. They also kidnapped many babies and forced them to become stormtroopers. They secretly built a superweapon called Starkiller Base. They used the weapon to blow up the capital of the New Republic, Hosnian Prime.\nNow that the New Republic is gone, the First Order wants to create the Empire again."}

It was made up of many planets, but all the planets had the same currency and official language. All the planets had to follow certain laws and economic rules. An example of this is that slavery is outlawed in all Republic planets. The government is a federal republic. Its leader is the Supreme Chancellor, who is chosen by voting. Each planet also chooses their Senators and Representatives to vote on and pass laws. There is also a Supreme Court. \nThe Republic is protected by the Jedi Order. The Jedi are a group of knights who protect democracy and civilization so that peace can exist in the galaxy. \nThe last Supreme Chancellor was Sheev Palpatine. He would later become the emperor of the Galactic Empire. In , the first movie in the Star Wars timeline, the Republic had become very corrupt and complicated. The Galactic Senate thought Chancellor Valorum had been a poor leader, so they voted to fire him. Only a short time after he was fired, they voted for Palpatine to replace him. \nMany member planets did not like what the Republic had become, so they left the Republic and created a new government, the Separatists. Count Dooku was the leader of the Separatists, but it was really created by Palpatine himself, and Dooku was his apprentice. Palpatine did this because he was trying to start a war. His plan was to use the war to weaken the Republic and destroy the Jedi so that he could create the Empire. His apprentice Dooku also created an army of clones so that the Republic would have an army to fight the war. Palpatine should have stopped being Chancellor long ago, but he stayed being Chancellor because the Senate voted that he can have emergency powers. That meant that he could pass any law he wanted to because the Republic was fighting a war against the Separatists. \nNear the end of the war, Palpatine told the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker that he was a Sith Lord, someone who uses the dark side of the Force. When Anakin told the Jedi Council that Palpatine was a Sith, Mace Windu and three other Jedi Masters went to Palpatine's office to arrest or kill him. They failed because Palpatine tricked Anakin in helping kill Mace Windu. He used this attempt as an excuse to give Order 66 to the clone army. This order was given to clone troopers to kill any Jedi they see. Palpatine also ordered Anakin, now Darth Vader, to bring clone troopers to destroy the Jedi Temple and kill all the Jedi there, even the children. Most Jedi were killed only a short time after the order was given. \nHe then tricked the Senate into thinking that the Jedi wanted to destroy the Republic, so he created the Empire to make everyone think they would be safer. After the Empire was created, the military became much bigger and most freedoms were taken away. In , Emperor Palpatine got rid of the Senate, which was the only thing from the Republic that still existed. He hoped that after this, memories of the Republic would disappear. \nHowever, people who still believed in the Republic created the Rebel Alliance and fought a war against the Empire. After the deaths of both Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader and the Battle of Jakku, the Empire surrendered to the Rebel Alliance. This ended the war and the New Republic was created, but the New Republic was destroyed only a few decades later. This was because the First Order, the military that was created from what was left of the Empire, created a superweapon called Starkiller Base. They used the weapon to blow up the capital of the New Republic, Hosnian Prime."}

Black, Asian, and multi-racial people are more likely to identify as nonbinary. Nonbinary people are also generally young (below 45) and more highly educated. Nonbinary people were also shown to be more likely to be in poverty. They are also more likely to have attempted suicide than binary people.

{"id": "687239", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=687239", "title": "1980 Quebec referendum", "text": "The 1980 Quebec independence referendum was the first referendum in Quebec on whether Quebec should make a deal with Canada that would allow the province to have more control over its own laws, government, and trade agreements with other countries. The referendum was called by Quebec's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) government. The PQ wanted Quebec to be independent from Canada.\nThe province-wide referendum took place on Tuesday, May 20, 1980, and the proposal to request more independence from Canada was defeated. 59.56 percent of voters voted against the referendum question and 40.44 percent voted in favour of it.\nA second referendum on sovereignty in 1995 also failed, but by a smaller margin (50.58% to 49.42%).\nBackground.\nQuebec, a province in the Canadian Confederation since its foundation in 1867, has always been the only province where the most commonly spoken language is French. Quebec has also historically been very connected to French culture and the Catholic Church, which was seen as the national church when the French colonists began to settle in what became Quebec. Many Quebecois people value their French identity and culture. In the early 1960s, Quebec went through a Quiet Revolution where politicians separated the role of the church from the role of government organisations in a process called secularisation. During this time period, political groups in the province began to identify as federalists (who wanted to be a part of a unified Canada) and sovereigntists (who wanted Quebec to become a sovereign nation state, separate from Canada).\nA prominent sovereigntist was Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, who helped found the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) with like-minded separatists. The PQ proposed \"sovereignty-association\", a proposal for Quebec to be a sovereign nation-state while also sharing an economic partnership with Canada. The PQ had originally planned on declaring independence upon forming government, without putting it up for a vote in Quebec. Instead of doing this, the PQ chose to use a referendum so that the international community would be more likely to accept them as a truly independent nation.\nThe PQ won the 1976 election, beating the governing Quebec Liberals. The PQ campaign platform included a promise to hold a referendum on sovereignty-association during their first term. In government, the PQ created a number of popular reforms to long-term issues in the province, including francophone nationalist laws such as Bill 101, which reinforced French as the province's official language.\nThe PQ's beliefs were in conflict with the federal Liberal government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau, who did not agree with Quebec sovereignty. Instead, Trudeau urged Quebecers to seek empowerment at the federal level through reforms that provided for bilingualism and protection for individual rights. Trudeau was considered such a major opponent to Quebec sovereignty that L\u00e9vesque refused to call a referendum while Trudeau was the Prime Minister.\nThe Progressive Conservatives led by Joe Clark won a minority government in the May 22 1979 federal election. Clark's minority government made a point to not have the federal government be involved in the referendum, leaving the task of representing federalist voices to Claude Ryan, the new leader of the Quebec Liberal Party.\nOn June 21, 1979, L\u00e9vesque announced the promised referendum would occur in the spring of 1980, and that the question on the ballot would be announced before Christmas.\nLead-up to the Referendum Campaign.\nOn November 1, 1979, the Quebec government released its constitutional proposal in a white paper titled \"Qu\u00e9bec-Canada: A New Deal. The Qu\u00e9bec Government Proposal for a New Partnership Between Equals: Sovereignty-Association\".\nA dramatic change occurred in Ottawa on December 11, 1979, when the Clark government unexpectedly lost a vote of confidence on a budget bill, forcing a federal election. Three days afterward, Trudeau announced his return as leader of the Liberals. Polls showed Clark losing handily.\nQuestion.\nThe wording of the referendum question was a subject of debate between members of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caucus. Some preferred a simple wording focused on Quebec becoming sovereign from Canada. L\u00e9vesque realised that sovereignty-association would require negotiations with the Government of Canada. L\u00e9vesque decided that the question would be written so that it gave the government of Quebec the power to negotiate with the Government of Canada, and that if the referendum passed, they would have a second referendum after making an agreement with the Canadian government so that Quebecers could approve the deal or vote against it. He also felt the safety of a second referendum would convince swing voters to vote \"Yes.\" \nA significant debate arose as to whether a \"question\" under the \"Referendum Act\" could have more than one sentence: the final compromise was to use semicolons.\nThe question announced on December 20, 1979 was: \"The Government of Quebec has made public its proposal to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, based on the equality of nations; this agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad \u2014 in other words, sovereignty \u2014 and at the same time to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency; any change in political status resulting from these negotiations will only be implemented with popular approval through another referendum; on these terms, do you give the Government of Quebec the mandate to negotiate the proposed agreement between Quebec and Canada?\"\nL\u00e9vesque, while noting its cumbersome nature, stated that it was transparent and could be easily understood.\nLegislative debate.\nOn February 18, 1980, the federal Liberals won a majority in the House of Commons, and Trudeau returned as Prime Minister. Trudeau announced Jean Chr\u00e9tien as having responsibilities for the federal response to the referendum.\nTelevision had recently been introduced to the Quebec National Assembly, and the legislative debate on the referendum question was scheduled for prime time live viewing on March 4, 1980. The debate lasted two weeks, and the result was a PQ success and a disaster for the provincial Liberals. The PQ Cabinet, coordinated by House Leader Claude Charron, provided detailed outlines of their files and the benefits they said sovereignty would provide them. The Liberals did not consider that the television audience would view their quick and taunting retorts about the referendum question to be insubstantial compared to the lengthy and detailed speeches of PQ members. The Liberals seemed to lack preparation and Ryan, unaware of the television cameras, was caught yawning on a few occasions during Liberal interventions.\nPolls released after the debates showed the Yes and No side roughly even, with a majority among Francophone voters for the \"Yes\" side.\n\"Brunch des Yvettes\".\nLess helpful to the \"Yes\" campaign was a speech by former television presenter Lise Payette to a committee in Montreal, where she mocked what she viewed as the \"No\" side's complacency by imagining a person who planned on voting \"No\" as a \"Yvette -\" a docile schoolgirl from pre-Quiet Revolution schoolbooks. Payette also used this as a general theme in the legislature. Payette stated that Ryan wanted a Quebec full of \"Yvettes\" and that his wife, Madeline Ryan, was an Yvette. Lise Bissonnette, a popular journalist, responded to Payette's personal attack wrote a sarcastic editorial that compared Payette's television career with Mme Ryan's accomplishments in the public and private sector.\nPayette apologized during the legislative debate, but the remark and the editorial sparked a movement. On March 30, a group of 1,700 women, including Madeline Ryan, held the \"brunch des Yvettes\" at the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in Quebec City. The movement grew until a rally at the Montreal Forum on April 7 when 14,000 women denounced the minister's declarations about women and manifested their support for the \"No\" side.\nCampaign.\nOn April 15, L\u00e9vesque announced before the National Assembly the referendum would occur on May 20, 1980. The same day, on the opening of the House of Commons, Trudeau announced that the Government of Canada would not negotiate sovereignty-association under any circumstances, as he considered the question too vague and the Canadian government's authority too uncertain to do so. He also stated that the question was too vague to give L\u00e9vesque and the PQ any mandate to declare independence, making any result from a \"Yes\" vote impossible; in contrast, he offered that a \"No\" vote would lead to constitutional change. His position was supported by Clark and national NDP leader Ed Broadbent.\nThe \"Yes\" campaign was, in the initial stages, low key. It focused on gaining broad acceptance of sovereignty-association through specialized \"regroupments\" that would be presented with special certificates at ceremonies led by L\u00e9vesque and other cabinet ministers. The regroupments were seen as an attempt to show broad support for the movement and create conversations at the ground level, however, the attempt to create them in some heavily Federalist professions, such as lawyers, prompted a severe backlash.\nThe \"No\" campaign, led by Ryan, was run as a traditional election campaign, with Ryan campaigning during the day and making speeches in local hockey arenas across rural Quebec.\nControversially, the Canadian government became involved on its own accord in the referendum despite the provisions of the provincial \"Referendum Act\", which tightly restricted all campaigning to the designated \"Yes\" and \"No\" committees with set budgets. Canadian government politicians made appearances coordinated by Minister of Justice Jean Chr\u00e9tien and Marc Lalonde, mainly speculating on the economic uncertainty a \"Yes\" vote could bring. Chr\u00e9tien argued that prominent PQ member Claude Morin would sacrifice Canada's oil and national gas price to drive in an ambassadors' Cadillac. Lalonde argued that old age pensions were directly threatened by a \"Yes\" vote. Though initially reluctant, Ryan started to accept and welcome the Canadian government's help, and continued to speak across Quebec.\nThe referendum prompted an unheard-of political mobilization, and the campaign was seen as a traumatic event in Quebec, as the hard choice between \"Yes\" and \"No\" shattered the nationalist consensus that had existed since the Quiet Revolution.\nTrudeau at Paul Sauv\u00e9 Arena.\nOn May 14, six days before the vote, Trudeau made his final appearance at a packed Paul Sauv\u00e9 Arena, where the PQ had celebrated their victory in 1976. Trudeau attacked the \"Yes\" campaign for not asking a clear question, and stated that a \"Yes\" vote was a dead end, given that the rest of Canada was not bound by the question and that it was too vague to pursue independence if negotiations were refused.\nTrudeau then stated that he would interpret a vote for the \"No\" as a mandate to renew federalism and change the constitution, putting his MPs' seats on the line if he were to fail to keep this promise. Addressing himself to Canadians outside Quebec on behalf of his MPs, Trudeau challenged English Canada that change would have to occur and that the referendum could not be interpreted as an endorsement of the status quo.\nAfter this Trudeau hit an emotional high note, invoking a remark by L\u00e9vesque days earlier that he was showing his \"Elliott\" side during the campaign. Trudeau detailed the story of his parents, who had both had many ancestors in Quebec, and remarked that his full name was both a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and a Canadian name. Trudeau then began to list members of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois who had Irish or English last names. The riposte brought the crowd to an uproar, and Trudeau exited to chants of \"Elliott.\"\nThe speech, which prompted Morin to wonder if his mind was changed, was seen as the death knell of the \"Yes\" camp, despite L\u00e9vesque's attempts to cast doubt over Trudeau's words.\nImmediate aftermath.\nAfter the lopsided defeat, a visibly emotional L\u00e9vesque addressed his supporters, many of whom were shown on screen in tears at the result. L\u00e9vesque began his concession speech by saying \"My dear friends, if I understand you correctly, you're saying: 'until next time.'\" In the speech, he called the Canadian government's involvement in the campaign \"scandalously immoral,\" and emphasized that the result must be accepted and that it was now the Canadian government's responsibility to provide the changes to the constitution that Trudeau had promised. L\u00e9vesque ended by asking the audience to sing \"Gens du Pays\" for him, as he did not have any voice left.\nClaude Ryan's speech was later in the evening. After refusing to let Jean Chr\u00e9tien use the microphone to address those gathered, he proceeded to demand an election be called and listed every riding that had voted for the \"No\" side. The speech was generally seen as callous and harsh, especially after the emotional crowd scenes broadcast during L\u00e9vesque's speech. Trudeau addressed the country afterward with a more conciliatory tone, emphasizing the need for unity after the hurt feelings and strained friendships that had been caused by the referendum. The next morning, Chr\u00e9tien was tasked with creating a provincial consensus.\nExpenses.\nMaximum amount authorized by referendum law: $2,122,257 ($0.50/voter x 4,244,514 voters)\n\"No\" Committee:\n\"Yes\" Committee:\nEffects.\nAfter the referendum, Trudeau acted upon his promise by calling together the provincial premiers in a first ministers' conference. The meeting showed signs of deadlock, and L\u00e9vesque surprised observers by uniting with the dissident premiers, who warmly received his decentralist views. Facing a lack of cooperation from the premiers, Trudeau then announced his intention to unilaterally patriate the constitution from the United Kingdom and have a charter of rights and constitutional amending formula approved by national referendum.\nIn the meantime, there was a provincial election in Quebec. Despite a brief post-referendum malaise, the PQ easily defeated Ryan's Liberals in the 1981 provincial election, campaigning both on their governing record and against Trudeau's intentions. Notably, the PQ did not promise to hold a second referendum.\nWith regards to Trudeau's plans to unilaterally patriate and change the constitution, the newly re-elected L\u00e9vesque, who had initially argued for the incorporation of a Quebec veto into the new constitution, agreed with eight other premiers (the Gang of Eight) to a proposal that would not allow Quebec a veto, but would permit \"opting out\" of certain federal endeavours with compensation.\nThe federal government, still interested in proceeding unilaterally, sought an opinion on whether it was legally entitled to do so from the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court ruled that any constitutional changes, including patriation of the constitution, could be made unilaterally under the letter of the law, but, by non-binding convention, \"a substantial degree of provincial consent was required\".\nThe Supreme Court's decision prompted a final meeting among the first ministers. L\u00e9vesque abandoned the Gang of Eight and opted to join Trudeau in advocating immediate patriation with the promise of a future referendum on the other matters. The other premiers, loath to be seen arguing against the charter of rights that was included in Trudeau's proposed constitutional changes, formulated a compromise proposal with Jean Chr\u00e9tien that was acceptable to the Canadian government. The compromise came during the Kitchen Meeting, which took place after L\u00e9vesque had left for the evening. In Quebec, that night has sometimes been called the \"Night of the Long Knives\".\nAs a result of the compromise between the premiers (other than L\u00e9vesque) and the federal government, the government partiated the Canadian constitution in the Constitution Act, 1982 without support from L\u00e9vesque or Quebec's National Assembly. The result was a shattering defeat for the PQ, especially after the Quebec government's loss in its Quebec Veto Reference case. The National Assembly of Quebec, compared to its position in 1976, actually lost power under L\u00e9vesque and the PQ.\nHistorical debate would centre on whether Trudeau's advocacy and agreement on patriation were in accord with or in contravention of his commitments made in his speech at the Paul Sauv\u00e9 Arena. Trudeau defended his actions by stating he had kept his promise to deliver a new constitution that resided entirely within Canada and an embedded Charter of Rights. Quebec nationalists argue that this is an overly literal view of his words and that, in context to a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois audience, Trudeau had promised that Quebec would be given a status in accordance with a decentralized view of federalism, or his MPs would resign.\nIn 1984, Brian Mulroney led the Progressive Conservatives to victory nationally, having committed during the campaign to try to find a way to accommodate Quebec's objections to the constitution. L\u00e9vesque pledged to take the risk of trying to work towards a deal with Mulroney. This led to a split in the PQ and subsequently L\u00e9vesque's resignation from politics in 1985. After the PQ defeat by the Liberals of Robert Bourassa, the Mulroney government began negotiations with Quebec to find a deal that would be acceptable to all provinces. The 1987 Meech Lake Accord and the 1992 Charlottetown Accord, despite receiving unanimous consent among the provincial premiers, each failed in dramatic public fashion, reviving the sovereignty movement.\nThe PQ returned to office, led by hard-line separatist and former Finance Minister Jacques Parizeau, in 1994. Parizeau called a second sovereignty referendum of 1995, which featured a more direct question. That referendum failed by a margin of less than 0.6%."}

It is an opt-out tax paid when the property is vacant. It is paid in addition to the regular property tax. The rate for this tax is a half per cent of a home's assessed value for owners who are residents of British Columbia (BC), one per cent for Canadians from other provinces and two percent for owners from other countries. Homes that are not exempt from this tax, pay it in addition to their regular property tax. This tax is not to be confused with Vancouver's empty homes tax, which is also being levied on empty homes located in the city of Vancouver.\nAll owners of homes in British Columbia are invited to fill out applications for exemption from this tax every year. If a home is owned by more than one person, for example a couple, all owners must complete a separate application for exemption. A part-owner who does not file for an exemption must pay the tax based on their proportional part of the assessed value even if the home is occupied. Tens of thousands of homeowners have not filed for exemption by March 30, 2019. \nThe BC Goverment says the tax is a \"key measure in tackling the housing crisis in major urban centres in British Columbia\". It says that it took this action because the people who live and people who work in BC deserve to have affordable housing. According to the goverment, the tax is a part of it's 30-Point Plan\u00a0to make housing more affordable. The tax is Targeted at speculators who own homes in BC but do not pay taxes. It changes empty homes into occupied housing. It also creates revenue which will pay for affordable housing. \nThis tax is levied on empty homes in most urban centers:\nWithin these areas, any reserve lands, treaty lands, or self-government First Nations are exempt.\nThe rate of the tax for all Canadians has been lowered to one half of a percent. This happened after negotiating between the NDP Party and the Green Party.\nReception.\nSome commentators such as Douglas Todd believe that this tax has achieved its goal.He says that prices of homes in Vancouver are moderating as a result of the tax being implemented.\nThe speculation tax has been named as one of the contributors to a slump in commercial real estate investment in Vancouver in 2018. Asian investments in Vancouver declined to less than $350 million from more than $1 billion in 2016 and 2017. According to government figures the tax brought in revenues of $115 million from 12,029 homeowners iduring a 15-months period in the 2018-2019 provincial fiscal yearwhich ended on March 31, 2019. \nThe tax has caught many unaware. For example, a Victoria, BC resident who bought a home in 2018 but worked in the United States the previous year, ended up owing almost five thousand dollars to the BC government.\nIn August of 2019 John Mackie of The Province reported that this provincial vacancy tax and the Empty Homes Tax are leading to larger numbers of real estate listings of luxury condos in downtown Vancouver."}

The theory was later developed and continued by R. Edward Freeman in the 1980s. Since then, it has gained wide acceptance in business and in strategic management, corporate governance, business purpose and social responsibility. The definition of corporate responsibilities has been frowned upon as creating a false relationship between the 'shareholder model' and the 'stakeholder model', or a false analogy of the requirements towards stakeholders and other interested parties."}

It has been the governing party of Uruguay since 2005. Presidents Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez and Jos\u00e9 Mujica are members of the party.\nHistory.\nFrente Amplio was a coalition of more than a dozen leftist parties and movements.It was founded in 1971. Its first president was General Liber Seregni. he was also the front's first candidate for the Presidency of Uruguay. The front was declared illegal during the 1973 military \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". However, it emerged again in 1984 when democracy was restored in Uruguay.\nIn 1994 Progressive Encounter (Encuentro Progresista) was formed by several minor independent factions. Then the EP and FA started contesting elections jointly. They used the name \"Encuentro Progresista - Frente Amplio\". Later Nuevo Espacio became linked to the front. After that, it started contesting elections as \"Encuentro Progresista - Frente Amplio - Nueva Mayoria\".\nIn 2005 Progressive Encounter and New Majority (essentially Nuevo Espacio) merged into the front, and the coalition took the name of \"Frente Amplio\". Previously, Progressive Encounter and New Majority had been separate organizations.\nThe alliance is formed by:\nPre-2004 election: economic crisis.\nStarting with the election of Luis Alberto Lacalle of the National Party in 1989, an economic reform began. \nThe reform was designed to modernize the country. However this led to a devaluing of the peso and laws protecting banking secrecy. This secrecy lead to Uruguayan banks becoming a place to launder money from drug and other illegal businesses. \nBy the turn of the century, half the nation had to survive in the informal economy. In 2002, the economic crisis of Brazil and Argentina spread to Uruguay. This crisis was caused by the lack of productive power. In August of that year, the nation received 1.5 billion US dollars from the IMF to try and help with the crisis. The ruling Colorado Party\u2019s response to the crisis was to flood police into the poorer neighborhoods. This was the state of the nation when the Broad Front began campaigning for the 2004 election.\n2004 election: Vazquez and economic restoration.\nThe party's victorious 2004 campaign was the first time in the history of Uruguay which a left-leaning party gained majority. There are two major reasons the party took power in 2004. The first reason was that there was a obvious movement towards more moderate policies, and the other reason was that the front's support of an increased welfare state created a bond with working-class people."}

Previously, in Genzano, and probably in other locations of the Castelli Romani, the custom of preparing flower carpets for the feast of \"Corpus Christi had\" existed for some time. The tradition was born in Rome in the first half of the seventeenth century and had been adopted in the localities of the Alban Hills probably due to the close ties of this territory with Gian Lorenzo Bernini , the main architect of Baroque celebrations. It is believed, in fact, that the tradition of creating paintings by means of flowers was born in the Vatican basilica by Benedetto Drei , head of the Florerian Vatican, and of his son Pietro, who had used \"leafless flowers, minced to emulate mosaics\" June 29, 1625, feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the patrons of Rome. A few years later, in 1633, another floral painting was made by Stefano Speranza, a close associate of Bernini. Oreste Raggi says that, it was Bernini himself who succeeded Benedetto Drei when he died, and \"Rome popularized this art\". \nIn Rome the custom of flower displays disappeared at the end of the XVII century. In Genzano, on the other hand, it continued into the eighteenth century, according to an anonymous manuscript 1824 which is preserved in the Central National Library of Rome and printed only recently, that says in Genzano some families used to display flowers in front of their home on the occasion of the three different processions that took place on the anniversary of \"Corpus Domini\" , one on Thursday, the other two on the following Sunday. Since none of the three processions passed through \"Via Sforza\" , Don Arcangelo Leofreddi, who lived on that street, asked the Bishop of Albano Fran\u00e7ois-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis for to vary the path on the Thursday procession the 8th. Having obtained the permit, Don Leofreddi \"asked all the inhabitants (via Sforza) to make floral decorations, each at their own expense, in front of their homes, and everyone did\". There is disagreement on the date of the first Flower Festival in Genzano: some date it back to 1778 ; others as of June 6, 1782 , the date on which the carpet covered the entire street (previous floral displays covered small garden sections). \nIn the nineteenth century the Genzano Flower Festival took place annually, except for some periods of interruption: the first interruption was from 1845 to 1863 ; the second interruption, also lasting nineteen years, from 1875 to 1894. It was restored in 1894 by the \"Company of Saint Luigi\" Catholic circle. In the early twentieth century, the installation of the floral display was not very constant. The tradition of the floral display resumed on the occasion of \"the interdiocesian Eucharistic Congress\" of 1922 , where it was held in Genzano, and since then it has been held annually, except for interruptions in the years 1932 , 1934 , 1935 and during the five years of World War II . \nSince 1875 theFlower Festival has taken place in \"Via Italo Belardi\" , formerly \"Via Livia\" , the street that connects the main square of the town ( \"Piazza IV Novembre\" ) to the Church of Saint Maria of Cima. The street is completely covered by a floral carpet covering an area of 1890 m\u00b2, generally composed of thirteen \"sections\", in addition to the decoration of the staircase leading to the Church of Saint Maria of Cima which is located at the top of the hill. Each \"framework\" is generally 7m x 114. \u00a0 The subjects are generally reproductions of known artworks or geometric motifs and are religious or civil in nature, which are chosen by a special Commission that presides over the display. To compose the thirteen paintings of the Flower Festival of Genzano it takes about 500 quintals of flower petals or vegetable essences. The sides are protected by columns made with mortelle and are always connected by festoons of mortella. \nUnlike the times of Massimo d'Azeglio, the flowers currently come from greenhouses; however; as in the past, hundreds of people are involved in separating the petals and distributing them in baskets depending on the color (an operation called \"piluccamento\" ). The baskets are then placed in cellars and caves located near the town hall with the aim of preserving them until the day they are used. \nGiven the perishability of the material with which this huge carpet is created, the flowers are laid out either on the same day as the festival or the night before the festival. On Saturday evening the architects of the Flower Festival , generally the authors of the various paintings, will draw the contours of the paintings on the roadway, first with chalk and then with lime, based on the original sketch, also using perforated cartoons (\"dusting\" technique). The placement of the flowers is done by placing the petals, taken from the baskets, within the contours already traced on the street. On Sunday evening Mass is celebrated in front of the Church of Saint Maria of Cima and, after a solemn Eucharistic celebration in which the bishop of Albano often takes part, the carpet is covered by the religious procession of the celebrants who bring the Blessed Sacrament to the not so distant Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity. The carpet is maintained, with replacements of withered petals, until Monday evening, when the destruction of the floral display bychildren (the so-called \"shoulder\" ) takes place."}
{"id": "688255", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=688255", "title": "Basque Country (autonomous community)", "text": "The Basque Autonomous Community (, EAE; , CAV) is an autonomous community in northern Spain. It has the Basque provinces of \u00c1lava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa. It is also called the \"Basque Country.\"\nThe Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community was called a \"nationality\" in Spain by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Navarre decided not to be part of the Basque Country. Instead, it became a different autonomous community.\nThere is no capital in the autonomous community right now, but the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, in \u00c1lava, has the Basque Parliament, the Basque Government, and the house of the President of the Basque Autonomous Community (the Palace of Ajuria Enea). The High Court of Justice of the Basque Country is in Bilbao. Vitoria-Gasteiz is the city with the most land, with 277\u00a0km2 (107 sq mi), Bilbao has the most people, with 353,187.\nPeople also say \"Basque Country\" when they talk about the larger cultural region (Basque: \"Euskal Herria\"), the home of the Basque people, which has the autonomous community in it.\nGeography.\nThese provinces make up the autonomous community:\nFeatures.\nThe Basque Country touches Cantabria and the Burgos province to the west, the Bay of Biscay to the north, France (Nouvelle-Aquitaine) and Navarre to the east and La Rioja (the Ebro River) to the south. The territory has three parts, separated by the Basque Mountains. The main line of mountains makes the watershed between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. The highest place in the mountains is in the Aizkorri massif (1551 m). The three areas are:\nAtlantic Basin.\nThe Atlantic Basin has many valleys with short rivers that flow from the mountains to the Bay of Biscay, like the Nervi\u00f3n, Urola, and Oria.\nThe coast is rough, with high cliffs. The main parts of the coast are the Bilbao Abra Bay and the Estuary of Bilbao, the Urdaibai estuary and the Bidasoa-Txingudi Bay that makes the border with France.\nMiddle.\nBetween the two mountain ranges, there is a high plateau called \"Llanada Alavesa\" (the \u00c1lava Plains), where the capital Vitoria-Gasteiz. The rivers flow south from the mountains to the Ebro River. The main rivers are the Zadorra River and Bayas River.\nEbro Valley.\nThe Ebro is a river in that starts in Cantabria and flows through the southern part of the Basque Autonomous Community. This makes an area called the Ebro Valley. The Ebro Valley is well-known for famous wine. \nClimate.\nIn the Basque Autonomous Community, rivers usually flow down from the Basque Mountains. The mountains also separate the climates in the autonomous community:\nThe northern valleys in Biscay and Gipuzkoa and the valley of Ayala in \u00c1lava are part of Green Spain, where there is a lot of rain.\nThe climate in the middle part is more like the middle of Spain. This gives warm, dry summers and cold, snowy winters.\nThe Ebro Valley's climate is just like the middle part of Spain: winters are cold and dry and summers very warm and dry, and it rains the most in spring and autumn. Overall, it does not rain very much in this part of the autonomous community.\nDemographics.\nAlmost half of the 2,155,546 people in the Basque Autonomous Community live in Greater Bilbao, the area around the city of Bilbao. Of the ten biggest cities, six are part of Bilbao's conurbation (Bilbao, Barakaldo, Getxo, Portugalete, Santurtzi and Basauri). This is also called Greater Bilbao.\nBecause 28.2% of the Basque population is born outside the autonomous community, immigration is important for Basque demographics. Since the year 1900, most of these people have come from other parts of spain, like Galicia or Castile and Le\u00f3n. Recently, many of these people have gone back to the places they were born. Now, immigration comes from other countries, mostly in South America.\nRoman Catholicism is, by far, the biggest religion in the Basque Country. In 2012, 58.6% of Basques called themselves as Roman Catholic but many people do not believe in religion: 24.6% were non-religious and 12.3% of Basques were atheist."}

It does not enroll students and does not award any degrees. It was founded in 1597 under the will of Sir Thomas Gresham.\nThe College gives over 140 free public lectures every year. Since 2001, all lectures have also been made available online.\nProfessors.\nThere seven original Gresham College Professorships that date back to the origins of the college. They are in Astronomy, Divinity, Geometry, Law, Music, Physic and Rhetoric.\nThese subjects reflect the curriculum of the medieval university (the trivium and quadrivium).\nThe college played an important role in the Enlightenment and in the formation of the Royal Society. Early distinguished Gresham College professors included Christopher Wren, who lectured on astronomy in the 17th century, and Robert Hooke, who was Professor of Geometry from 1665 until 1704.\nThe professors received \u00a350 a year. The terms of their position were very precise, for example: :\"The geometrician is to read as followeth, every Trinity term arithmetique, in Michaelmas and Hilary terms theoretical geometry, in Easter term practical geometry. The astronomy reader is to read in his solemn lectures, first the principles of the sphere, and the theory of the planets, and the use of the astrolabe and the staff, and other common instruments for the capacity of mariners.\"\nToday three further Professorships have been added to take account of areas not otherwise covered by the original Professorships:\nThe professors currently hold their positions for three years, extendable for a fourth year. They give six lectures a year. There are also visiting professors appointed to give series of lectures at the College. There are a number of single-lecture speakers.\nThe lectures are often given in the Museum of London, which has a bigger lecture room than the College."}

These include the Gunter's chain, Gunter's quadrant, and the Gunter's scale. In 1620, he invented the first successful analogue device which he developed to calculate logarithmic tangents. These inventions are related to the main practical maths interests of England at that time. These were maritime navigation, land surveying and accounting.\nGunter was taught mathematics by Henry Briggs. He became a Gresham Professor of Astronomy, from 1619 until his death. Gunter invented the terms cosine and cotangent, \nGunter's scale.\nGunter\u2019s scale (called by seamen \"the Gunter\") is a large plane scale, usually 2 ft. long by about 1\u00bd in. broad, and engraved with various lines of numbers. By means of this scale questions in navigation, trigonometry etc. are solved with the aid of a pair of compasses.\nThe slide rule was invented around 1620\u20131630, shortly after John Napier's publication of the concept of the logarithm. In 1620 Gunter developed his calculating device with a single logarithmic scale. With additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. In c. 1622, William Oughtred of Cambridge combined two handheld Gunter rules to make a device that is the modern slide rule. \nGunter's chain.\nGunter's chain was in common use in surveying up to modern times. It is 22 yards long and is divided into 100 links. Its usefulness comes from its decimal division, and the fact that 10 square chains make an acre. It folds up in sections, and is carried by the surveyor.\nGunter's quadrant.\nHis quadrant of 1623 was used for tell the time, find the length of day, when the sun had risen and set, the date, and the meridian. It used scales and curves of the quadrant and related tables. Gunter's quadrant was fairly simple, and was widely used in the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThis instrument is used to find the hour of the day, the sun\u2019s azimuth, and other common problems of the globe, and also to take the altitude of an object in degrees. These things are needed by ships on long voyages, and on long overland excursions.\nControversies.\nLike his contemporary at Cambridge, Isaac Newton, Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students. Also like Newton, he became involved in a controversy over priority (who invented what and when). This involved his one-time student Richard Delamain. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653."}

It is the oldest political party in modern Greek politics. The party played a significant role in the Greek resistance. The party's membership was largest in the mid-1940s. It participated in the Greek Civil War, but ended on the losing side and was banned until 1974.\nThe party took part in a coalition government in 1989 when it got more than 13% of the vote.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe October Revolution of the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917 gave rise to the foundation of communist parties in many countries all over the globe. KKE was founded on 4 November 1918 as the Socialist Labour Party of Greece (Greek: \u03a3\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039a\u03cc\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2, \"Sosialistik\u00f3 Ergatik\u00f3 K\u00f3mma Ell\u00e1das\"; acronym: \u03a3\u0395\u039a\u0395, \"SEKE\"). The party was run by a five-member central committee. The committee consisted of Nikos Dimitratos, D. Ligdopoulos, M. Sideris, A. Arvanitis and S. Kokkinos.\nThe background of KKE has roots in more than 60 years of small socialist, anarchist and communist groups. These groups were mainly in industrialized areas. They followed the example of the Paris Commune and the 1892 Chicago workers' movement for the eight-hour working day. These groups pushed for the unification of Greek workers into trade unions, the implementation of an eight-hour day in Greece and better salaries for workers. Inspiration came from the Paris Commune and the communist revolutionary efforts at the beginning of the century. The destruction almost 20 years of wars brought upon the Greek workers also played a role. As a result, a unified Social-Communist party was founded in Greece.\nAt the Second Congress of the SEKE in April 1920, the party decided to affiliate with Comintern. The Comintern was an international communist organisation founded in Moscow in 1919. The SEKE changed its name to the Socialist Labour Party of Greece-Communist (SEKE-K). A new central committee was elected, which included Nikos and Panaghis Dimitratos, Yannis Kordatos, G. Doumas and M. Sideris. At the Third Extraordinary Congress of the SEKE-K in November 1924, the party was renamed the Communist Party of Greece and adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism. Pandelis Pouliopoulos was elected as general-secretary. Ever since, the party has functioned on the basis of democratic centralism.\nKKE between the two World Wars.\nKKE strongly opposed Greece's involvement in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922. It considered the war an imperialistic plot to control the market of Asia Minor. KKE members advocated this position both on the front as well as in the mainland. KKE worked with the Soviet ambassador to persuade Venizelos' administration to withdraw its troops from Asia Minor. KKE also tried to persuade the Soviet Union to pressure Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk to allow autonomy for Greek cities in Asia Minor."}

It represents the unity of the Spanish monarchy and state, and it also promotes the \"heroic virtues of the [Spanish] race\". The \"Y\" in \"yugo\" stands for \"Ysabel\", as in another spelling of Queen Isabella; and the \"F\" in \"flechas\" stands for the first letter in King Fernando's name.\nThe yoke also takes inspiration from the legend of the Gordian knot, as well as the motto that comes with it, \"Tanto monta\". The arrows being wrapped together refers to the moral story that claims that, like people, arrows can be easily broken one by one, but less so when they are together.\nIn the late 1800s, the yoke and arrows became the political symbol of the Spanish socialist party. After more socialist parties were created and decided to use different icons, the fascist Falangist party began to use the yoke and arrows."}

The species is endemic to the sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters of the Australian continental shelf. It was previously called \"Chelonia depressa\". \nThe turtle gets its common name from the fact that its shell has a flattened or lower dome than the other turtles. It may be olive green to grey with a cream underside. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). \nThe hatchlings, when emerging from nests, are larger than other turtle hatchlings. The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Data Deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to decide its conservation status at present. \nThe flatback turtle is the least endangered of all of the sea-going turtles. Unlike other turtles, there is not a big human demand for the meat of the flatback. It does not swim far from shore, so it does not get caught in nets as often as other sea turtles. These reasons may be why it is not in more danger of extinction."}

It is a large family of turtles, and its fossil history goes back to the Cretaceous. \nThe family Chelidae has about 60 living species in about twenty genera. The family is entirely Gondwanan in origin, with no members found outside Gondwana, either now or as a fossil.\nThey are called side-necked turtles because they withdraw their heads by moving the head sideways (see Pleurodira). Other turtles, if they withdraw their heads, pull them back in the vertical plane. \nThe subfamilies within Chelidae show that most of the South American species and all the Australian species are a clade, that is, evolved from the same ancestor (monophyly. The far more ancient turtle genus \"Hydromedusa\" is their sister taxon.\nNowadays, all these species live in fresh water, but we know from the fossil record that many of their forebears lived in seas around the world."}

The place of discovery was in the north of Luzon, a large island in the Philippines.\nThe remains are about 67,000 years old. They are small bones and teeth from Callao Cave. Researchers think they are from a hitherto unknown species. At least one expert, Aida G\u00f3mez-Robles, \"is hesitant to unequivocally say the find represents a new species\".\nDiscovery.\nThe archaeologist who found the remains is Armand Mijares. He had dug in Callao Cave in 2003, but he stopped at a little more than one meter deep. He said that the discovery of \"Homo floresiensis\", a hominin from about 50,000 BP found in Indonesia in 2004, led him to return to the cave in 2007. About a meter and a half below where he had stopped before, his team found fossil bones. One of the bones was a human metatarsal, a foot bone.\nAt first, Mijares thought the fossil bone could belong to a small \"Homo sapiens\". But after more digging in 2011 and 2015, he and his team recovered more bones and some teeth. These remains from at least three individuals were seen as too different to belong to \"Homo sapiens\". Therefore, scientists working on the material have said it is a new species."}

On 1 December 1981 the flight crashed on Corsica's Mont San-Pietro, killing all 180 people on board. The crash was the deadliest and first major aviation accident involving a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, as well as the second-deadliest air disaster in France behind Turkish Airlines Flight 981.\nAccident.\nFlight 1308 took off from Brnik Airport on a chartered flight from Slovenia (at the time Yugoslavia) to Corsica's capital city of Ajaccio with 173 Slovenian tourists and 7 crew members. At some point, the co-pilot let his young son enter the cockpit.\nWhile in its holding pattern, the flight was instructed to descend through the minimum holding altitude of 6,800 feet. As it descended, its Ground Proximity Warning System gave off several audio warnings, which the crew did not react to for approximately ten seconds. Three seconds before impact, the crew increased engine power and attempted to climb, but were unable to clear the terrain. One of the aircraft's wings collided with the summit of Mont San-Pietro and broke off. The aircraft then went into an uncontrolled dive and violently crashed on the other side of the mountain eight seconds later, killing everyone on board. The time of the accident was 8:53\u00a0a.m. local time (07:53 UTC).\nInvestigation.\nThe subsequent investigation into the disaster revealed that control mistakenly believed that Flight 1308 was out of its holding pattern, believing it was already located over the sea, while in reality it was located inland, over the mountainous terrain of Corsica. The crew, apparently surprised at the instruction to descend, repeated several times that they were still in the holding pattern, which the control acknowledged. The crew was unfamiliar with the airport and its vicinity, as this was the first flight of Inex-Adria Aviopromet to Corsica. The investigation determined that the imprecise language used by the crew of the MD-81 and the air traffic controller played a significant role in the accident. Air traffic control in Ajaccio was cleared of all charges.

As a direct result of the accident, the equipment was upgraded and the approach pattern changed.\n2008 clean-up operation.\nSome debris and human bodies were removed from the crash site after the accident in 1981. In 2007, POP TV (a TV station in Slovenia) did a news report on the accident. They visited the crash site in Corsica and found many of the airplane's parts still scattered on Mont San-Pietro, in rugged and inaccessible terrain. Subsequently, the Government of Slovenia, Adria Airways and Kompas (the Slovenian travel agency that organized the fatal trip in 1981) organized and funded a clean-up operation. A Slovenian team of about 60 soldiers, mountain rescuers, civil protection and rescue service members, medical personnel, and other volunteers removed about 27 tons of aircraft remains in May 2008. The removed debris included one aircraft engine and large wing parts. Some of the parts were so large they needed to be machine cut before transporting them from the mountain by a helicopter. Several human remains were also found, and were either sent for further identification tests, or were properly disposed. A commemorative plaque was installed at the site of the initial wing impact."}

This includes the north tower; at times, it was feared that the north tower would also be affected.\nOver 400 people helped fight the fire.

Two police officers were injured, and one firefighter was critically wounded, who was treated in a nearby hospital.\nCause.\nAt the time the fire was being fought, its cause was not known, but it was being treated as an accident. The investigation most strongly suspected a case of \"accidental destruction by fire\", but had not ruled anything out, saying it was too early to know the cause of the fire. It is not yet known if renovation work contributed to the fire. There have been other cases where renovation-related fires smoulder for hours unseen before breaking out.

In his interviews, mostly with rappers and other musicians, he will bring up something about the interviewee that is not very well known to the public to confuse, scare or impress them. For example, during an interview with Pharrell Williams from N.E.R.D, Nardwuar pulled out a vinyl record featuring the very first recorded track by Williams, causing him to pause and say, \"This is one of the most impressive interviews I've ever experienced in my life. Seriously.\" Later in the same interview, Williams said, \"Your research is second-to-none. Second-to-none.\"\nNardwuar was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1999, he had a brain hemorrhage, and in 2015, he had a stroke."}
