They were mostly made from the Afrika Korps and The Italian Centauro Armoured Division (with units of Italian Tunisians). They also included some divisions from the German 5th Panzer Army. The II Corps of the U.S Army was led by Lloyd Fredendall. The British 1st Army was led by Kenneth Anderson.\nThis battle is remembered as the first major battle between the Americans and Germans in World War Two. The Americans were trying to get to Tunis quickly, before more Axis troops could arrive from Europe.\nIt was the first battle in which the American soldiers fought an enemy with better organization and experienced soldiers. The battle at the beginning was very costly for the Americans. Many of them died and they were forced to retreat from their starting position at the Faid Pass. American and British reinforcements soon arrived to help and they forced Rommel to retreat to better positions.\nThis battle caused a change in American military organization, to better prepare the army for the war in North Africa. Several commanders were replaced. When Rommel and the Americans fought again weeks later, the American improvements were seen in battle."}

They made the graphics pixel art to make sure the game was not controversial. A developer, Jonatan S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m started making a game called Super Carnage, which was very similar to Hotline Miami. The aim of the game was to kill as many people as possible. The game was left unfinished because of difficulties coding the AI. \nBefore starting development, the developers wanted inspiration, so they watched some movies like Kick-Ass, Drive and Cocaine Cowboys. They wanted to raise questions about what it meant to kill a virtual person in a video game. Mid-way through development, S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m worried that he was running out of money, so he started Hotline Miami. They spent 9 months in an apartment coding the game. Dennis Wedin said this about the development of the game: \"It was fucking hard...\". \nS\u00f6derstr\u00f6m said that he created Hotline Miami with Games Maker, because it let him make the game fast. He also said that it doesn't need that much programming knowledge to use. He said it was a lot slower than other engines, and is quite limited. They had some problems with Games Maker, because they were using an old version. Weldin claimed he liked games that were just games, but S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m wanted the player to think about the game's meaning. \nThe developers said that the AI was the hardest thing to create in the game.\nStory and Gameplay.\nThe player controls an un-named hero (who fans call Jacket), who's gradually losing his mind. The objective of each level is to kill all enemies in the room, and go to the next one. After every job, the player goes to the same store to order a pizza. The player then return to your safehouse.\nMasks.\nThere are unlockable masks in Hotline Miami, each have their own abilities.\nSequel.\nA sequel to \"Hotline Miami\", called \"\" was released on March 10, 2015. It was originally going to be DLC for the main game, but this was changed. \nReviews.\nThe game got very good reviews, with IGN praising its \"striking blend of fast ultraviolence, a dense, challenging story and brilliant presentation\".

The title of marquis of Beauvau was granted to the head of the family by Louis XIV in 1664. The family also had rights to the prestigious title of \"cousin du Roi\", reserved for a few families with an alliance with the royal house. Marc de Beauvau, Prince of Craon (1679\u20131754) was entitled prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1722, and it was under this title that the family was admitted to the \"honneurs de la Cour\" in 1775.\nPrinces of Craon.\nThe princely title of Prince of Craon was a title used by the Beauvau family using their status as Prince of the Holy Roman Empire which was gained in 1722. This was later fully recognised by Louis XV of France in 1755. The title was inherited by male offspring. It became extinct in 1982. These princes were sometimes but also known as the Prince of Beauvau.\nIn Lorraine.\nThe Beauvau family later enjoyed close relations with the then ducal family of Lorraine even going so far as to name one of their sons after a son of the Duke. They had a townhouse in Nancy, itself the capital of Lorraine. The townhouse was called the \"H\u00f4tel de Craon\". The family also had a residence in Paris named the \"H\u00f4tel de Beauvau\".\nOther websites.\nFurther information on the family"}

The campaign was planned and executed by the Union Army under Major general William T. Sherman. The first part of the plan was to defeat the Confederate Army of Tennessee led by General Joseph E. Johnston. The second goal was to take the important city of Atlanta. Sherman captured Atlanta but was unable to completely destroy the Army of Tennessee.\nBackground.\nThe war had been going on for three years when Ulysses S. Grant was given command of the Union Army. While a much smaller army, the Confederates had been moving their forces to battle whichever Union army was active at the time. By doing this they had won most of the battles. Grant decided to coordinate his armies and defeat the confederates. His field armies would all engage the confederate field armies at the same time. This would pin down the smaller southern armies so the Union army could defeat them. Grant would personally lead the Army of the Potomac against Confederate general General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia. He would try to capture the capital of the confederacy, Richmond. Sherman would move his army against Johnston and capture the South's second largest city, Atlanta. If successful, it would shorten the war and get President Abraham Lincoln reelected that November. If they failed, Lincoln would lose the election and the southern states might break away permanently.\nThe campaign.\nBy 1864, the Confederacy knew they could not defeat the stronger Union army. But they could win the war by simply not losing to the North. They would keep fighting until the Union got tired of war and asked for peace. Lee had to defend Richmond and keep the Union army away. Johnson had to defend Atlanta and keep their supply lines open.\nSherman had over 100,000 men he divided into three field armies. Johnson had 53,800 men. At the last minute he received another 15,000 men making his the larger of the two main Southern armies. But it was still only about half the size of the Union army facing him. In the opening weeks of the campaign Sherman forced Johnston's confederates back from one place to another. Repeatedly Sherman moved two of his field armies against Johnston while a third army under James B. McPherson threatened the supply lines. McPherson's army was also used in flanking maneuvers. Sherman's combined armies kept moving towards Atlanta while Johnson's armies fell back. Finally Johnson retreated into Atlanta on July 9\u201310. Jefferson Davis the Confederate president, dismissed Johnson for not stopping the Union army. He gave command to John B. Hood, Johnson's second in command. Hood had little chance of succeeding. Sherman's army was five miles from the city when Hood took command.\nSiege of Atlanta.\nHood ordered his men to attack Sherman's army on July 20. The attempts failed and by July 22 Hood had lost 8,000 men to Sherman's losses of about 3,000. Hood retreated back into Atlanta again. Sherman set up his cannon and began a bombardment of Atlanta that would last a month. Then Sherman withdrew his armies leaving only a small force. Hood's army followed them to Jonesboro, Georgia. Sherman's army cut Hoods line of retreat back to Atlanta. The Battle of Jonesborough lasted two days and ended on 1 September. After taking heavy casualties what was left of Hood's army burned their supplies and ammunition and left Atlanta. Sherman then took Atlanta. This was a major loss for the confederacy. It almost guaranteed Lincoln's reelection. It also led to the next campaign, Sherman's March to the Sea."}

Many of them are vines whose stems twine round trees and branches. There are quite a number of other methods of climbing.\nThe climbing habit has evolved many times. In most cases the climbing plants were more diverse (had more species) than their non\u2013climbing sister groups. \nIt is a key innovation which has been very successful. Over 130 plant families include climbers. Vine species may represent more than 40% of species diversity in tropical forests.\nIt has evolved independently in several plant families, using many different climbing methods: Botanists generally divide climbing plants into two broad groups:\nThe climbing fetterbush (\"Pieris phillyreifolia\") has a strange habit. It is a woody shrub vine which climbs without clinging roots, tendrils, or thorns. Its stem goes into a crack in the bark of fibrous barked trees (such as bald cypress). The stem flattens and grows up the tree \"underneath\" the host tree's outer bark. The fetterbush then sends out branches that emerge near the top of the tree.\nMost vines are flowering plants. These may be divided into woody vines or lianas, such as wisteria, kiwifruit, and common ivy, and herbaceous (nonwoody) vines, such as morning glory.\nOne odd group of climbing plants is the fern genus \"Lygodium\", called \"climbing ferns\". The stem does not climb, but rather the fronds (leaves) do. The fronds unroll from the tip, and theoretically never stop growing; they can form thickets as they unroll over other plants, rock faces, and fences."}
{"id": "467614", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=467614", "title": "Flanking maneuver", "text": "In military tactics, a flanking maneuver (also called a flank attack), is an attack on the sides or rear of an opposing force. If a flanking maneuver succeeds, the opposing force would be surrounded or have to fight from two or more directions. This reduces the ability of the outflanked force to move or defend itself. Unlike an envelopment, which depends on the enemy's defensive position, any obstacles and the terrain, a flanking maneuver uses the enemy's forward movement to create an attackable flank. A psychological advantage may also be present. The confusion and threat from multiple directions can often cause shock and panic. This may cause soldiers to run from the battle. A larger-scaled tactical flanking is called a strategic flanking. This is where the targets of the flanking could be as large as divisions or even entire armies.\nStrategy.\nA flanking maneuver works best when an enemy is engaged at their front. Often an opposing force must be maneuvered into a position where a flanking attack would work. An ideal situation is getting them into a position where their front is narrow and the flanks are long. A classic example of a flanking maneuver was by Confederate general Stonewall Jackson against the Union Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Chancellorsville."}

The battle was fought on the Greek island of Crete.\nOn the first day of fighting, the German paratroopers suffered heavy losses due to heavy anti-aircraft warfare and fierce ground fighting, but the British were confident that they would destroy the German invasion. Due to miscommunication and bad decisions, the Germans were able to capture an airfield, allowing them to transport supplies and reinforcements to Crete, and destroy the Allied forces defending the island.\nThis battle was the first time Hitler used paratroopers on a massive scale, and the first big airborne invasion in Military history, and the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from the German Enigma code, and the first time German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population. That was common later in the war. Losses were so great, that Hitler decided not to make any more big paratroop assaults."}

Perennial streams are different to intermittent streams; which normally stop flowing for weeks or months each year. They are also different to ephemeral streams that flow only for hours or days after rainfall. During unusually dry years a perennial stream may stop flowing. In a drought, they may not flow for months. The differences between perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams are not exact and can change if different measures are used by different groups.\nIn dry weather it may not be possible to see the water flowing, or see any water at all. In streams with gravel, sandy or rock bottoms, the water may be flowing beneath or between the rocks. In biology, a stream is flowing if there is enough water to support aquatic life, including fish and gill-breathing amphibians, benthic insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. These can live in a shallow flow beneath rocks or logs. The flow may be so small that it can not be measured by stream flow measurement instruments."}

He was killed at the Battle of Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign.\nEarly life.\nMcPherson was born in 1828 near Clyde, Ohio. He was the eldest son of William and Cynthia (Russell) McPherson who were farmers. To help his family, in 1841 at age 12, McPherson entered an apprenticeship at a general store. He became a clerk for Robert Smith. McPherson was raised and tutored along with Smith's children. His father died in 1847 and Smith paid for McPherson's education at Norwalk Academy. In 1849 Smith arranged an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. McPherson spent much of his time tutoring his John Bell Hood. McPherson graduated in 1853, first in his class.\nMilitary career.\nHe secured a posting as a second lieutenant with the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He worked on improvements to New York Harbor. He was assigned to the building of Fort Delaware. McPherson then directed worked on fortifications on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. In 1858 he was a first lieutenant. In 1861 when the Civil war broke out, he raised a company of volunteers to fight for the Union. Now a captain went to Boston to supervise the construction of harbor defenses. His former commander helped him by making McPherson his Aide-de-camp and promoted him to Lieutenant colonel.\nIn early 1861 McPherson was assigned to the staff of general Ulysses S. Grant as an engineering officer. In 1862 he impressed his superiors and was assigned to supervise military railroads in Mississippi. In this position he was a brigadier general of volunteers. After the Battle of Corinth McPherson was promoted to the rank of major general (8 October 1862). He became commander of Seventeenth Corps in the Army of the Tennessee. At the Battle of Raymond a small force of Confederates attacked his 10,000 man column. They were almost completely destroyed before they realized their mistake. He commanded his corps at the Siege of Vicksburg. \nIn January 1864 he succeeded general Sherman as commander of the Army of the Tennessee. As part of Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, on several occasions his army threatened the enemy's supply lines. McPherson's army was also used in flanking maneuvers. Sherman's combined armies kept moving towards Atlanta while the confederate armies, under Joseph E. Johnston, fell back. Finally Johnston retreated into Atlanta on July 9\u201310. Jefferson Davis the Confederate president, dismissed Johnston for not stopping the Union army. Davis gave command to general John B. Hood, McPherson's friend and former roommate. Hood had little chance of succeeding. Sherman's larger army, including McPherson's Army of the Tennessee, was five miles from the city when Hood took command.\nHis death.\nOn learning of Johnson's replacement by Hood, and knowing Hood as well as he did, McPherson readied his army for an attack by Hood's confederates. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee was holding Sherman's left flank. On 22 July 1864, Hood directed his attack against McPherson's army. The battle went on for several hours. During a break in the fighting McPherson saw a gap developing in the Union lines. He rode out with a staff officer to close the gap. He came upon confederate skirmishers who ordered him to surrender. He turned and spurred his horse to escape, but was shot and killed. His body was returned to the Union lines for burial. Both Sherman and Hood mourned his death. McPherson was the second highest ranking Union officer killed in the civil war. He was buried in his hometown of Clyde, Ohio. Five years after his death President Rutherford B. Hayes presided over a ceremony where a bronze statue was placed over his grave."}

The movement's demands were initially around the exclusion of the use of the Serbian language and the exclusive use of the Croatian language in Croatia (even though Serbian and Croatian are considered dialects of the same language), declaration of Croatia as a national state of Croats and Croatia as a successor to the medieval Croatian kingdom. Maspok's ultimate goal was an independent Croatian state. The Maspok movement was supported by a lot of Croatian Communists and the Usta\u0161e emigration in the West.\nMovement political demands.\nThere were three basic points the Maspok used to attack the federal government of Yugoslavia: distribution of Croatia's tourism revenue in other parts of Yugoslavia, the amount of money Croatia contributed to the underdeveloped Yugoslav republics, and the question of the official Croatian language in Croatia. Maspok demanded recognition of the Croatian language as the official language in Croatia, its exclusive use in education, media, and the state affairs, which meant the expulsion of the Serbian language from Croatia. Maspok insisted on the specific nature of the Croats and their culture and civilization, as well as cultural differences between Croats and other ethnic groups and ethnic minorities in Yugoslavia. The movement, broadly supported by Croats, demanded a separate national Croatian bank, Croatian army, and Croatian representative in the United Nations separate from the Yugoslav representation. \"Matica hrvatska\" (a Croatian cultural organization) and \"Hrvatski tjednik\" (Croatian Weekly newspaper) went so far to publish a constitution draft for the new Croatian state.\"Matica hrvatska\" published (November 1971) a full list of the Maspok's demands: Croatia defined as the state of Croatian people only, Croatian representative in the United Nations, Croatian national bank and national currency, Croatian army and Croat conscripts serving only Croatian army, Croatian language used in the army, Croatian state affairs, education, and media. \"Matica hrvatska\", at the time the Maspok movement culmination, cancelled the work on the Serbo-Croatian dictionary and rejected the Novi Sad Agreement (about the common Serbo-Croatian language). The Novi Sad Agreement based Serbo-Croatian language orthography was replaced by the Croatian language orthography written by S. Babic, B. Finka, and M. Mogus and printed by the \"Matica hrvatska\" the same 1971. year. Zagreb University provided a broad and a public support to the Maspok political demands. The Zagreb University students staged mass demonstrations in Croatia in order to express their support to Maspok.\nMaspok development and demise.\nAccording to some historians, Maspok was an Usta\u0161e insurgency in Yugoslavia mentored, guarded and supported by Savka Dab\u010devi\u0107-Ku\u010dar, Miko Tripalo and Pero Pirker, the political leadership of the Croatian Communist League. That time the Croatian Communist League general secretary, Milo\u0161 \u017danko, publicly denounced the destructive nationalism of \"Matica hrvatska\", Dab\u010devi\u0107-Ku\u010dar, Tripalo, and Pirker. \u017danko, on the Tenth plenum of the Croatian Communists (January 1970) accused Dab\u010devi\u0107-Ku\u010dar, Tripalo, and Piker claiming that these three worked along with \"Matica hrvatska\" against the Yugoslav socialism and on the destabilization of Yugoslavia. By the Josip Broz approval and the Bakari\u0107's help, \u017danko was excommunicated from the Croatian Communist League on the same plenum. Another strong opposition to Maspok came from the members of the Zagreb Praxis group (Rudi Supek, Milan Kangrga, most notably).\nSome minor actions against Serbs in Croatia were demonstrated by defacing or destroying Cyrillic signs and by outbreaks of violence at soccer matches. The Croatian leadership persuaded Broz that they had the situation under control. When Broz visited Croatia in July 1971 the Croatian anthem was played after the Yugoslav one.\nJosip Broz suppressed Maspok and, at the same time, made a great concession to the Croatian nationalism. Broz allowed use of the Croatian language in Croatia and confederalized Yugoslav Constitution in 1974, giving a veto rights to the Yugoslav republics when eventually attempting to change the Constitution. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution was a source of a great dissatisfaction and concern of the Serbs in Yugoslavia. The Croatian Communist League leadership, Dab\u010devi\u0107-Ku\u010dar, Tripalo, and Pirker were forced to resign from their state and the Communist League positions and some of the Maspok leaders were arrested and imprisoned. Among the arrested Maspok leaders were Franjo Tu\u0111man and Bruno Bu\u0161i\u0107.\nBroz's persecution of Serbian academia and liberals in other Yugoslav republics.\nDuring the year of 1972. Broz removed from the politics and state affairs Serbian Communists Marko Nikezi\u0107 and Latinka Perovi\u0107, Slovene Stane Kav\u010di\u010d, and Macedonian Krste Crvenkovski. According to historians, the rule of the for-life Yugoslav President were more dangerous Yugoslav liberals than the Croatian Maspok.\nIn order to consolate Croatian nationalists, Broz persecuted Serbian academics who pointed at subordinated position of the Serbian people in Yugoslavia. The two leading Serbian intellectuals, Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107 (prominent Serbian writer) and Mihailo \u0110uri\u0107 (Belgrade University Law School professor) questioned justification of the Albanian autonomy on the historic Serbian province Kosovo and asked why the Serbs in Croatia did not have any autonomous status, and why Vojvodina had the autonomous status despite the fact that the majority of her inhabitants were the Serbs. These two intellectuals were publicly denounced by the Broz's regime and persecuted. Professor \u0110uri\u0107, seeing the escalation of the Maspok nationalism and secessionism in Croatia, warned that at that time Serbia's status in Yugoslavia was highly discriminatory and that Serbia was mercilessly and unjustly accused for advocating centralism and unitarianism. \u0110uri\u0107 warned further that it was forbidden to raise questions about responsibility of those who committed the genocide of Serbian people in the Independent State of Croatia during the WWII. He said that the borders of the Socialist Republic of Serbia are not national nor historic borders of the Serbs in Yugoslavia. The Prof. \u0110uri\u0107 trial and verdict were the part of the Broz's regime political equilibrium in the time of the Maspok activity culmination in Croatia and the time of the Maspok's leadership trial and imprisonment.\nCroatian Spring and dissolution of Yugoslavia.\nCroatian Spring played a significant role in the drafting Yugoslav Constitution of 1974. The Constitution paralyzed the federal power of Yugoslavia by shifting the state administrative power to the Yugoslav republics. The Constitution, being insufficiently unclear and already the result of compromises with various nationalist groups in the republics and provinces, was a blueprint for secession."}

The battle was part of the Atlanta Campaign directed by Union Army general William Tecumseh Sherman. The city of Atlanta was a major supply center, railroad hub and symbol of the Confederate States of America. Its loss proved to be a major blow to the Confederacy and led to the end of the Civil war.\nBackground.\nMilitary.\nThe war had been going on for three years when Ulysses S. Grant was given overall command of the Union Army. While a much smaller army, the Confederates had been moving their forces to battle whichever Union army was active at the time. By doing this, they had won most of the battles. Grant decided to coordinate his armies and defeat the confederates. His field armies would all engage the confederate field armies at the same time. This would pin down the smaller southern armies so the Union army could defeat them. Grant would personally lead the Army of the Potomac against Confederate general Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia. He would try to capture the capital of the confederacy, Richmond. Sherman would move his combined armies against the Confederate Army of Tennessee led by General Joseph E. Johnston. One of Sherman's goals was to capture the South's second largest city, Atlanta. If successful, it would shorten the war.\nPolitical.\nBy 1864 President Abraham Lincoln was in political trouble. When elected in 1860 Lincoln had won a majority of the Electoral College votes. But he only won 39.8% of the popular vote. He was probably the least popular president when he took office in 1861. Seven southern states had broken away and formed the Confederate States of America. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began. The war had gone badly for the Union. Even though they had a much larger army, they had lost a number of battles. By 1864 Lincoln needed some victories if he wanted to be reelected that November. If successful, the Atlanta Campaign could guarantee Lincoln would remain president.\nAtlanta campaign.\nThe Atlanta Campaign began on 6 May 1864. Sherman had over 100,000 men he divided into three field armies. Johnston's army was only about half the size of the Union army facing him. Sherman used his larger army in a series of battles to push Johnston back. He used two of his armies facing Johnston's Army of Tennessee. The third army was used in flanking maneuvers. Finally, Johnston retreated into Atlanta on July 9\u201310. Johnston's strategy had been to \"trade space for men and time\". He would not commit his army to a major battle but delayed and harassed Sherman every chance he got. It took Sherman 72 days to march his armies only 100 miles. Johnston's plan was to slow down and wear out the Union army and make them tired of fighting. But Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, dismissed Johnston for not stopping the Union army. He gave command to John B. Hood, Johnston's second in command.\nThe battle.\nWhen Hood took over command of the Army of Tennessee, Sherman was only five miles from Atlanta. Hood was the most aggressive general the confederacy had. He intended to defend Atlanta. On July 20 Hood's army attacked Union general George Henry Thomas's Army of the Cumberland. John Schofield's Army of the Ohio and James B. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee were both moving around the Confederate right and could not help Thomas. But Thomas's army stood fast. The Confederates withdrew after losing 2,500 killed or wounded. Hood next attacked on 22 July. He threw his entire force against McPherson's Army of the Tennessee on Sherman's left flank. The battle started about noon and lasted until midnight.\nDuring the fighting general Dodge (the author) could see a gap in the Union lines. He sent messengers to warn the commanders to move to close the gap or the Confederates would break through. Apparently General McPherson saw the same gap. He rode out with a staff officer to close the gap. He came upon confederate skirmishers who ordered him to surrender. He turned and spurred his horse to escape, but was shot and killed. At one point the Union line broke. But cannon fire from Schofield's Army of the Ohio and a counterattack drove the Confederates back. Hood lost about 8,000 (killed, wounded and missing) to 3,722 Union losses. After the battle Hood fell back to defend Atlanta. He had little to show for his attacks except a high casualty rate the Confederates could not afford.\nSherman set up his cannon and began a bombardment of Atlanta that would last a month. Then Sherman withdrew his armies leaving only a small force. As intended, Hood's army followed them to Jonesboro, Georgia. Sherman's army destroyed the railway tracks back to Atlanta. The Battle of Jonesborough lasted two days and ended on 1 September. After taking more heavy casualties, what was left of Hood's army burned their supplies and ammunition and left Atlanta. Sherman then took Atlanta. This was a major loss for the confederacy. It almost guaranteed Lincoln's reelection. The Battle of Atlanta marked the halfway point in the Atlanta campaign."}

It happens when a person is not able to control their body temperature. This can happen for many reasons, like very hot weather, fever, and some medicines or illegal drugs.\nDoctors define hyperthermia as a body temperature that is over 101 degrees Fahrenheit (equal to 38.3 degrees Celsius). This is higher than the average human body temperature, which is normally around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). When a person gets hyperthermia, they can have \"heat-related injuries\", where the high body temperature hurts the body.\nThere are three forms of heat-related injuries caused by hyperthermia: heat cramps (the least serious), heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (the most serious).\nCauses of hyperthermia.\nAll types of hyperthermia can be caused by the same things. Some common causes are:\nOther things that make a person more likely to get hyperthermia, especially if they are exercising or working, include:\nHeat cramps.\nHeat cramps are the least serious form of hyperthermia. (A \"cramp\" is a sharp pain caused by a muscle getting tighter and shorter.)\nSymptoms.\nThe major symptoms of heat cramps are:\nTreatment.\nPeople with heat cramps usually do not need medical treatment. The best treatments for heat cramps are:\nHeat exhaustion.\nHeat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps. If affects the whole body instead of just certain muscles, like heat cramps.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion may include:\nTreatment.\nPeople with heat exhaustion may need medical treatment.\nFirst aid for people with heat exhaustion includes:\nIf a person with heat exhaustion gets medical treatment, EMTs or doctors may:\nHeat stroke.\nHeat stroke is a medical emergency. If it is not treated quickly enough, it causes brain damage and death. It is one of the most common causes of death in sports that can be prevented.\nHeat stroke happens when a person gets so hot that their body cannot do anything to bring their temperature down. The body has tried every strategy it has to cool itself down. But the body is so hot that none of those strategies work any more. This causes the body temperature to rise very quickly. The body gets so hot inside that its tissues, especially the brain, get damaged. Usually, people with heat stroke have a body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. The brain cannot survive for long at these temperatures. Heat stroke can very quickly cause damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and muscles.\nSymptoms.\nEarly symptoms.\nOften, the first signs of heat stroke are:\nLate symptoms.\nAs heat stroke gets worse, symptoms that can kill the person start to appear. For example:\nTreatment.\nPeople with heat stroke always need emergency medical treatment as soon as possible. If a person might have heat stroke, 9-1-1 or another emergency telephone number should be called right away. The emergency medical dispatcher can explain what to do to help the person until an ambulance gets there.\nOnce the person with heat stroke gets to an ambulance or a hospital, treatments for heat stroke may include:\nPrognosis.\nThe prognosis for people with heat stroke depends on how high their body temperature got, how quickly their body temperature increased, and how quickly they got treatment.\nUp to 80% of people who do not get treatment for heat stroke right away die. But cooling people with heat stroke down right away, and getting them treatment very quickly, can change this so that only 10% die. But some people who survive have brain damage or other health problems caused by their heat stroke."}

{"id": "468300", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=468300", "title": "Bottom trawling", "text": "Bottom trawling is trawling (towing a trawl, which is a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is also called \"dragging\". Bottom trawling can be either benthic trawling or demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the bottom.\nAnother kind of trawling is midwater trawling (also known as pelagic trawling). This is where a net is towed higher in the water column. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, tuna, and mackerel. Bottom trawling catches both bottom-living fish. It also catches semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish. Trawling is done by a trawler. This can be a small open boat or a large factory trawler.\nTrawl nets.\nThe trawl doors disturb the sea bed. They create a cloud of muddy water which hides the oncoming trawl net. It also makes a noise which attracts fish. The fish begin to swim in front of the net mouth. As the trawl continues along the seabed, fish begin to tire and slip backwards into the net. Finally, the fish become exhausted and drop back, into the net and are caught. The speed that the trawl is towed at depends on the swimming speed of the species which is being targeted. It also depends on the gear that is being used. For most species, a speed of around 4 knots (7\u00a0km/h) is appropriate. Trawling is very easy way of catching large amounts of fish. But it has been compared to \"fishing with bulldozers\". Like a bulldozer it scrapes up everything on the bottom.\nEnvironmental impacts.\nBottom trawling has operated for over a century on heavily fished areas like the North Sea and Grand Banks. overfishing has long been seen as causing major ecological changes to the fish species on the Grand Banks. Lately there is concern about the damage which benthic trawling does to the seabed. A species of particular concern is the slow-growing, deep water coral \"Lophelia pertusa\". This species is home to a large community of deep sea organisms. It is easily damaged by fishing gear.

Ligatures usually replace two characters next to each other. The idea comes from handwriting and manuscripts.\nExample: the common ampersand (\"&amp;\") represents the Latin conjunction \"et\", meaning \"and\". The ampersand's symbol is a ligature, joining the old handwritten Latin letters \"e\" and \"t\" of the word \"et\", so that the word is represented as a single glyph.\nSometimes ligatures are made to make things more easy to read, or simply to make the writing/font nicer to look at. This is important in some forms of design work. \nType designers, who create fonts (or 'typefaces'), make ligatures for some combinations of letters. Today, most fonts are made on computers (these are called 'digital typefaces'). When two particular letters are typed together, the ligature will appear. The ligature look like the two different letters but slightly changed (sometimes joined together). It is actually a separate symbol that has been drawn by the creator, and is programmed to appear when two letters are put next to each other."}

He chose this stage name, because he wanted to purify himself and become one with the darkness and the Frost of Black Metal. He currently plays for the black metal bands Satyricon and 1349. He is considered reputable for being one of the fastest and most proficient drummer alive, and a legend to Black Metal and to Norway art scene. \nHe has also took part as a drummer with the bands Gorgoroth, Zyklon-B, Gehenna and Keep of Kalessin. He first joined Satyricon temporarily to record the band second demo \"The Forest is My Throne\" (split album form Satyricon and Enslaved from the year 1993 - \"Black Winds\" and \"Min hyllest til vinterland\" are the two other song of the 3 songs demo album), but that changed in the next release, the first studio album \"Dark Medival Times\" (1994), where he was promoted to a permanent member. \nSatyricon.\nSatyricon unleashed their next album \"Shadowthrone\" at the same year and in 1996 the milestone \"Nemesis Divina\", which is considered one of the best albums in the genre, proving their worth as a leading band. The fourth album signals a new era for the band with two ways: Satyricon became a two man project,with Satyr and Frost as remaining members and the band makes its first significant musical change: the new album \"Rebel Extravaganza\"(1999) contains some industrial elements blended with the old Satyricon sound. But the major change started with \"Volcano\"(2002), where the sound formula came closer to rock than the previous albums.This continued until \"The Age Of Nero\"(2008) and nowdays the musical aproach is simpler than before, with two studio albums being recorded with this style (\"Satyricon\" at 2013 and \"Deep Calleth upon Deep\" at 2017). \n1349.\nFrost was not limited to the success of Satyricon, as he is also an active member in another well-known band: 1349. Their enigmatic name has the time when black death came to Norway, killing 2/3 of the population of the country. Like Satyricon, he was not an original member of the band, as he participated in the first EP \"(1349\" at 2001) as a music session. This changed to the first album, \"Liberation\"(2003), which is very fast, raw and oldschool. When he listened to its material, he was excited and asked to be promoted to permanent member and so his desire was fulfilled. \nThe omens were good for the band and they unle\u03b1shed their next raging attacks with the \"Beyond The Apocalypse\"(2004) and \"Hellfire\"(2005). The success and quality of the band was so great in the genre, to the point that even touched Tom Gabriel Warrior (Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Tryptikon) who helped to mix their next album titled \"Revelations of the Black Flame\"(2009), which had lower speeds than the previous one. The band returned to its old style, with the two \"Demonoir\"(2010) and \"Massive Cauldron of Chaos\"(2014).\nOn contrary with Satyricon where Satyr writes the lyrics, Frost has provided 1349 also with some of his writing expressions. His lyrics can be found in Hellfire(from \"Hellfire\"), Demonoir(from \"Demonoir\"), Golem and Godslayer(both from \"Massive Cauldron of Chaos\"), where we observe his love for darkness and his aversion to the manipulation of Christianity to humans and the need of the average man to expel him from his life in order to reach the level of spiritual (and not only) satisfaction he wishes\nHe used blast beats during his performances with 1349 and Satyricon. He has since done more simplistic and mid-tempo with Satyricon. \n\"Gorgoroth\".\nFrost was a member of the band for the recording of their second album, \"The Antichrist\"(1996). He also participated as a guest at the \"Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam\"(2006) and at the \u201c\"Destroyer,or About How to Philosophize with the Hammer\"\u201c(1998) and especially on \u201cThe Devil, The Sinner and His Journey\u201c.\n\"Ov Hell\".\nAfter King ov Hell\u2018s expulsion from \"Gorgoroth\", he decided to create a new band with Shagrath(\"Dimmu Borgir\") on the vocals, where Frost and other great names, such as Ice Dale(\"Audrey Horne\",\"Enslaved\",\"Demonaz\"), Herbrand Larsen(\"Audrey Horne\",\"Enslaved\"), Teloch(\"Nidigr\",\"Mayhem\"), and King`s son Trym Hartmark Visnes. An album was recorded (\"The Underworld Regime\"-2010), but the band was dissolved as the God Seed reunited.\n\"Keep of Kalessin\".\nFrost participated in \"Reclaim\" (EP 2003), where he marked the group\u2019s return to active action as it was inactive for the second time since 2000.\n\"Zyklon-B\".\nZyklon-B was a supergroup, where his members were higly known musicians such as Frost, Ihsahn(\"Emperor\"),Samoth(\"Emperor\") and \u00a0Draug Aldrahn(\"D\u00f8dheimsgard\",\"Thorns\"). They recorded an \"EP Blood Must Be Shed\" and two split \"Blood Must Be Shed / Wraths of Time\", \"Necrolust / Total Warfare\" and split-up at 1999.\n\"Furze\".\nFrost was a session musician at the album \"UTD\"(2007) of the one man project(nowdays) Furze \n\"Gehenna\".\nFrost made a guest at the \"WW\"(2005) of Gehenna, who played in the whole album.\n\"Influences\".\nFrost feels that he was influenced by extreme bands such as \"Bathory\", \"Celtic Frost\", \"Darkthrone\" and \"Thorns\" but he\u2019s a big fan of the 70s rock. He\u2019s also influenced by musicians other than hard music like \"Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore\" and \"Klause Schulze\". As a drummer,he admires \"Bill Ward\"(\"Black Sabbath\"), \"John Bonham\"(\"Led Zeppelin), Ian Paice\"(\"Deep Purple\"), \"Mitch Mitchel\"(\"Jimi Hendrix\") and jazz musician \"Buddy Rich\". Even though their technic are very different from each other, he found that their playing had an incredible inhumane energy where he was seduced. Finally, as an extreme drummer, he could not not ignore \"Dave Lombardo\"(\"Slayer\") and \u00a0\"Fenriz\"(\"Darkthrone\"). Something to be mentionted, is that Frost bought a drumm kit from Hellhammer, that has been used for the recordings of other important bands, such as \"Burzum\",\"Mayhem\",\"Emperor\",\"Enslaved\",\"Satyricon\",\"Zyklon-B\" and \"Arcturus\".\nThe music approach he has when he is recording with Satyricon and 1349 according to him, is very different. With Satyricon he\u00a0 tries to fit more closely with other musical instruments, in order to sound like a group and in 1349 he concentrates more on how faster, heavier and violent can be. Also in 1349 he uses corpsepaint, with purpose to reach a higher place of spirituality, that he could not achive otherwise.\n\"Artwork\".\nAlongside with his musical creations he decided to contribute in some cases with his artistic capabilities. Especially with 1349 he created the cover design of Beyond the Apocalypse and the cover art of Hellfire. With Satyricon he designed the logos of Dark Medieval Times, The Shadowthrone, Nemesis Divina, and the artwork poster\u00a0 of Roadkill Extravaganza\u00a0 \u2013 A True Roadmovie.Finally\u00a0 he worked with Tormentor for the artw\nDuring a tour, he was denied entry to North America by the US Department of Homeland Security.

The show started around 1973 at Tacoma's public-TV station KTPS-TV. It was first called \"Cooking Fish Creatively\". Later it was renamed \"The Frugal Gourmet\". The award winning program was hosted by Jeff Smith. \nHistory.\nJeff Smith was the chaplain at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington from 1966 to 1972. In 1965, he taught a cooking class called \u201dFood as Sacrament and Celebration\". In 1972, he opened and ran a restaurant called the Chaplain\u2019s Pantry. In 1973, a local PBS television station KTPS-TV offered him his own cooking show, called \"Cooking Fish Creatively\". \"I had a producer who couldn't produce, a director who couldn't direct, a technician who couldn't tech, and I wasn't so good, either\", according to Smith. The show received two Emmy nominations. The show won a 'Best of the West' Award for Educational Television in 1976. After several seasons it was renamed \"The Frugal Gourmet\". The name change was suggested by his wife, Patty. \nThe Frugal Gourmet ran on PBS from 1983 to 1997. It was PBS's most popular cooking show. Smith always wore a blue and white striped apron that became his \"trademark\". In 1989, during the \"Three Ancient Cuisines\" run, Smith was joined by Craig Wollam, a professionally trained Chef. Smith met Wollam by accident in a Chicago restaurant and he was hired the next day. He stayed until the show was cancelled in 1997.\nFor the first seven seasons, the show was produced by WTTW in Chicago. From 1991, it was produced by KQED in San Francisco, and A La Carte Communications.\nFormat.\nDuring each show, Smith followed a recipe showing how to prepare a dish. He goes to different places by showing food from many different cultures. The show always ended with Smith saying \"Until I see you again, this is the Frugal Gourmet; I bid you peace, bye-bye\". Smith would remind his audience that \"frugal\" doesn't mean cheap. It means that you don't waste money. And \"gourmet\" means loving good food and wine.\nTheme song.\nThe theme music for \"The Frugal Gourmet\" was the Bourree movement from \"Water Music\" by George Frideric Handel.\nSyndication.\nFrom 1989 to 1997, reruns of earlier seasons of \"The Frugal Gourmet\" aired on Lifetime. When \"The Frugal Gourmet\" aired on Lifetime, episodes ran for about 21 minutes to make room for commercials, and several parts were cut. In 1991, GNT in Brazil began airing a Portugal dubbed version of the show entitled \"Frugal Gourmet\"."}

It is famous for its swarming behavior. It is native to the lowlands of central and northern South America.\nThis species has developed special night vision adaptations which help their night-time swarming and foraging behavior. It has important medicinal properties for the Pankarar\u00e9 people of Brazil.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Apoica pallens\" populations are native to the lowlands of Central and northern South America. Generally, they are found in areas of tropical savanna, semi-deciduous tropical dry forest, gallery forest, and marshland. \"Apoica\" is one of the prominent genera of the New World tropics, and is rather abundant.\nSwarming.\n\"Apoica pallens\" is best known for its unique swarm founding behavior, in which the adult population of a colony abandons an old nest and emigrates to a new site. This has been observed for several reasons. Firstly, as part of normal colony reproduction. And secondly, in response to severe disturbance or destruction of the original nest. Additionally, nest abandonment is sometimes correlated with changing climates, and in the case of \"Apoica pallens,\" has been observed more frequently during the dry season. Males follow swarm emigrations and may stay with the newly created colony for the following weeks.\nEpiponini are either permanently or mainly polygynous.\nOther behavior.\nForaging.\nForaging takes place at night. Swarms of wasps explosively leave the nest, then quickly return only to leave again in a similar fashion. As the night progresses there are moderate to heavy levels of return and departures by smaller groups of wasps. The foraging patterns of \"Apoica pallens\" depends on the moon\u2019s cycle: when the moon is new, it forages during the first four hours after sunset, with another small peak of activity just before dawn as wasps return to the nest. When the moon is waxing, it extends the hours of forage until individuals are out all night long.\nTheir adaptations allow them to forage in low light conditions. These wasps have larger visual fields compared to those of relatives.\nDominance hierarchy.\n\"Apoica pallens\" is a caste species with morphological differentiation between females. These castes are classified as workers and queens. This is based on the size of ovaries. The differences between the castes of queens and workers are formed during the larval stage. Queen-destined larvae show faster growth rates in various bodily compartments than worker-destined larvae. This results in individuals with different shapes even though larvae are about the same size.\nUses in folk medicine.\nFolk medicine is prominent in various areas of Brazil. Insects are used in folk remedies. Medicinal insects are the focus of healing methods targeted to treat ailments, serving as drug resources that come from nature. The nests of \"Apoica pallens\", is known to be significant in the practices of Pankarare \u0301Indians and also the rural people of Brazil.\nNests of these wasps are burned and the smoke released is inhaled in order to heal stroke. Furthermore, when the presence of evil is suspected in an Indian\u2019s life, they must bath in this smoke of the burning nest as treatment. In Matinha dos Pretos, pieces of the nest may be boiled in water to make a tea that serves as treatment for asthma.\nDiet.\n\"Apoica pallens\" collects various arthropods including flies, caterpillars, and beetles. It also collects pollen and nectar from banana blossoms. This species practices brood cannibalism: the adults will eat some of the brood if their own nutritional needs are not met. Generally, several adults will divide up a single larva. In addition, adults will exchange food via trophallaxis.\nDefense.\n\"Apoica pallens\" displays active, rather than chemical defense behavior. During the day, when adult individuals are not swarming, they cover the comb face of the nest several layers thick. The wasps on the outer layer of the comb face outward. They watch for predatory ants trying to reach the interior of the nest. It is thought that the advantages of this protective formation during the day is what led to the nocturnal foraging and swarming."}

Birrarung, and Wongete). The Yarra River is a perennial river in east-central Victoria, Australia. The river flows from its source in the Yarra Ranges west through the Yarra Valley. The river opens out into plains as it winds its way through Greater Melbourne. It then empties into Hobsons Bay in northernmost Port Phillip.\nThe river was a major food source for indigenous Australians during prehistoric times. It also served as a meeting place during those times. The river was first called \"Birrarung\" by the Wurundjeri. The current name was translated wrong from another Wurundjeri term in the Boonwurrung language; \"Yarro-yarro\", meaning \"ever-flowing\".\nThe river was used for agriculture by early European settlers. The landscape of the river has changed since 1835. The course of the river has been changed and widened in places. Widening and dams, like the Upper Yarra Reservoir have helped protect Melbourne from major flooding. Industrialisation led to the destruction of the marshlands at the joining of the Yarra and Maribyrnong Rivers in the area around Coode Island in West Melbourne. The yearly Moomba festival celebrates the Yarra River's meaning to Melbourne."}

He is best known as the original drummer of the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath. \nHe also performed lead vocals on two Black Sabbath songs: \"It's Alright\" from the album \"Technical Ecstasy\" and \"Swinging the Chain\" from the album \"Never Say Die!\".\nBiography.\nEarly years and Black Sabbath.\nBill Ward started to play drums as a child. He listened to the big bands of the 1940s. His major influences were Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson. \nLater he was influenced by drummers such as Larrie Londin, Bernard Purdie, Joe Morello, Keef Hartley, Hughie Flint, John Bonham, Ringo Starr, Jim Capaldi and Clive Bunker. \nIn the mid-1960s, Ward sang and played drums in a band called The Rest. \nWard and guitarist Tony Iommi played together in a band called Mythology. \nAfter Mythology disbanded, he and Iommi joined vocalist Ozzy Osbourne and bassist Geezer Butler to form a new band called Earth. The quickly renamed the band Black Saabbath due to another local band being called Earth.\nIn the 1970s, Ward's drug and alcohol use became a problem. By the late 1970s he was drinking during gigs, something he had never done before. He also began experiencing panic attacks. Ward has said he cannot remember the recording of the 1980 album \"Heaven and Hell\" due to his alcohol abuse. \nAccording to Black Sabbath bandmate Iommi, Ward disappeared on 21 August 1980, without saying goodbye, other than a telephone call to then-Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio informing him \"I'm off then, Ron.\" He then briefly played in a band called Max Havoc. \nIn 1983, he returned to Black Sabbath for the \"Born Again\" album. Ward once again left for health reasons before the band toured in support of the album. \nIn 1984, he rejoined Black Sabbath to record new material with David Donato but after several demo tapes, he once again left Sabbath.\nPranks.\nAccording to Iommi, he and the band would often set Ward's beard on fire and perform other harmful pranks on him. On one occasion, Ward received third-degree burns. In 1980, during the recording of \"Heaven and Hell\", Iommi doused Ward with a solution used by studio technicians to clean the tape heads. He then set light to the solution, which was much more flammable than Iommi had anticipated. Ward suffered third degree burns as a result and still has scars on his legs from the incident.\nIommi claims that Ward almost died in 1972, after a prank-gone-wrong during recording of \"Black Sabbath Vol. 4\". The band were renting a Bel Air mansion belonging to John DuPont of the DuPont chemical company. The band found several spray cans of gold DuPont paint in a room of the house; finding Ward naked and unconscious after a night of heavy drinking, they thought it would be funny to cover the drummer from head to toe in gold paint. Ward soon became violently ill and had a seizure and an ambulance had to be called. The paint had blocked all of Ward's pores, which his bandmates were subsequently informed can be fatal.\nSolo career.\nWard returned to playing music in the late 1980s. In 1989 he went to work on a solo album. This featured a lot of guest musicians, including former Black Sabbath bandmate Ozzy Osbourne and his guitarist, Zakk Wylde. Released in January 1990, \"\" showcased Ward's versatility in musical tastes and abilities. He did the vocals on some of the songs. \nIn 1997, Ward released his second solo album, \"When the Bough Breaks\".\nIn 2002 he released the song \"Straws\" as a single for charity. The song would reappear on his 2015 album \"Accountable Beasts\".\nLater career.\nIn 1985, Ward and the original Sabbath members had reunited for Live Aid. \nOn 15 November 1992, Ward reunited with the original Black Sabbath members at a Costa Mesa, California Ozzy Osbourne show. Sabbath, with the Judas Priest singer Rob Halford, opened the show for Osbourne. The Ozzy Osbourne band (Osbourne, Zakk Wylde, Mike Inez, Randy Castillo and John Sinclair) then did a full set. Osbourne then reunited with Iommi, Butler and Ward for four numbers.\nIn 1994, Ward made a brief return to the band for a South American tour, with Tony Martin fronting.\nOn 4 and 5 December 1997, Ward rejoined Black sabbath for two shows at the NEC in Birmingham. This made up the \"Reunion\" album. \nIn 1998, Ward suffered a heart attack during the rehearsals for a tour. He was replaced by Vinny Appice. Ward was forced to miss all but the last two Black Sabbath appearances while he recovered.\nIn 2000, Ward participated joined Iommi and Osbourne to record the track \"Who's Fooling Who\" for Iommi's first solo album.\nSince mid-2002, Ward has done a monthly internet-only radio show named \"Rock 50\" on radio station WPMD from Cerritos College in California. Ward plays a variety of metal, hard rock, and some classic rock.\nBrief reunion with Black Sabbath.\nIn October 2006, news leaked that Ward would be reuniting with Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Ronnie James Dio for a tour under the band name Heaven &amp; Hell. However, Ward later decided not to participate in the tour or continue participation in the band because of musical differences with \"a couple of the other band members\" and a concern about extended touring.\nOn 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with producer Rick Rubin and to start touring in 2012. In February 2012, however, Ward left before work commenced on \"13\". Ward said that he had failed to reach an agreement regarding his contract.\n However, he did later admit that his weight would have been an issue in a 2013 tour. Osbourne also suggested in an open letter that Ward's decision not to take part was down to his health. In April 2015, Ward criticised Osbourne on his Facebook fan page via a letter to his and the band's fans. Which prompted a rebuttal from Osbourne on his Facebook page:\nWard's surgery on his shoulder prevented him from playing drums again until May 2014. This delayed his third studio album \"Accountable Beasts\". He had also expressed a desire to tour behind the album once it is released, provided that sales were acceptable.\nWard says he has \"lost a friend\" in Osbourne, but maintains contact with Butler and Iommi; if they could \"come to some terms\", if Ozzy would make amends for statements he made in 2012 and 2013, he would rejoin Black Sabbath.\nWard reunited with Sabbath members Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler to accept the \"Lifetime Achievement\" award at the May 2015 Ivor Novello Awards.\nIn 2016, Ward debuted with a new band called \"Day of Errors\", which played its first gig in June that year at Gaslamp in Long Beach, California and also features Joe Amodea on guitar/vocals and Kill Devil Hill singer Jason \u201cDewey\u201d Bragg on vocals.\nWard was due to play a string of dates with his new band in December 2017 but had to cancel these when he was hospitalised with heart problems in November.\nHe once again reunited with Iommi and Butler in Los Angeles in May 2019, as Black Sabbath were awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy. Though Sabbath did not perform, Rival Sons performed a set of their songs for the occasion. A short time later Osbourne said in an interview that he wants to play one last show with the band's original lineup. Ward announced 3 weeks later on his instagram that he loved all 3 of his former Black Sabbath bandmates very much and was open-minded to playing a very last show with them.\nPersonal life.\nWard has two sons, Nigel and Aron, and one daughter, Emily. \nAccording to his Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi and Ozzy Osbourne, Ward has dramatically changed his lifestyle since Black Sabbath's 1970s and early 80s heyday. Iommi says he quit smoking, gave up alcohol, adopted a vegan diet, and no longer uses drugs of any kind. Osbourne says that Ward has been sober for approximately 30 years. However, more recently Osbourne has criticised Ward's health, describing him in 2013 as \"incredibly overweight\" and suggesting that he would have been unable to drum for Black Sabbath had he stayed in the band following their 2011 reunion, given his physical condition, although Ward himself has insisted his health has not affected his ability to play the drums.\nWard later admitted he underwent gastrointestinal surgery in 2013, and is still recovering. \"My health right now is not bad but it's not good enough to certainly play in any band never mind Black Sabbath.\"\nInfluence.\nDrumming website Totaldrumsets has listed Ward among \"The 100 Most Influential Drummers Ever!\" and has defined him \"the mastermind behind the unholy birth of heavy metal drumming\".\nEquipment.\nWard uses Tama drums, Sabian cymbals, Vic Firth drumsticks and Gibraltar hardware.\nTama \"Imperialstar\" drums\n\"AA\" and \"Hand Hammered\" Sabian cymbals"}

In some cases, the state prosecutes those accused of murder. In other cases, the federal government has jurisdiction. Who the victim of a murder is can also determine who has jurisdiction. The military of the United States also prosecutes murder under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \nJurisdiction.\nIf a murder is committed within the borders of a state, that state has jurisdiction. If the crime is committed in the District of Columbia, the D.C Superior Court has jurisdiction. In cases involving federal property or employees, the federal courts may have exclusive jurisdiction. The prosecution of murder is similar in Australia.\nIf the victim is a federal official, an ambassador, consul or other foreign official under US protection, then the federal government has jurisdiction. If the crime took place on federal property or involved crossing state lines it is under federal jurisdiction. Murder on naval or U.S. flagged merchant vessels in international waters is under federal jurisdiction. This is true also if crime happens on U.S. military bases worldwide. Murder by a member of the United States military anywhere in the world is a violation of Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The trial is held by a general court-martial.\nDual sovereignty.\nIn the United States the dual sovereignty doctrine applies to murder as well as to other crimes. In cases where a murder involves both state and federal jurisdiction, the accused can be tried and punished separately by each jurisdiction. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine this is not considered double jeopardy. If another federal law was violated in connection with a murder, then the murder can be prosecuted by a federal court. This is called \"piggyback jurisdiction\". In the United States there is no statute of limitations on the crime of murder. But most other federal laws have a five-year statute of limitations. An exception is for cases of terrorism where the statute of limitations is eight years. Or if explosives or arson were involved, the statute of limitations is ten years."}

One of the main rivers which flows into the Werribee River is the Lerderderg River. It begins in the hills near Ballan and flows for 110 kms before reaching Port Phillip Bay near the city of Werribee. \nMuch of the area along the river is protected by parks, including the Werribee Gorge State Park. The river also flows through the Werribee Open Range Zoo. The Werribee River Trail follows the river from Tarneit to Werribee.\nThe Werribee River flows into the Melton Reservoir. Water from the river is used to irrigate the market gardens of Bacchus Marsh and Werribee South. The Western Treatment Plant, the main sewerage treatment plant for Melbourne, is near the river mouth on the bay.\nHistory.\nBefore the arrival of white settlers, the Werribee River was the boundary of the Bunurong tribe. Its six clans lived along the Victorian coast across the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay to Wilsons Promontory.\nIn the late 1830s and 1840s the Werribee River was the scene of fighting between the Wautharong people and the European settlers. The squatter Charles Franks and a shepherd were speared to death near Mount Cottrell in July 1836. Because of this, John Batman led a group of men to punish the aborigines. They found a large group of aborigines and shot them, killing at least ten. There are also reports of flour containing arsenic being given to local aborigines.\nIn 1851 a large timber bridge was built to cross the Werribee River to replace an earlier wooden bridge. In 1852 this bridge was washed away when the river flooded.\nIn August 2004 the Victorian Government promised $300,000 to fix the Werribee River. This involved removing willow trees which were choking the river around the township and replacing them with native plants.\nThe name.\nThe explorers Hume and Hovell camped by the river on 15 December 1824. They named it the \"Arndell\" after Hovell's father-in-law. John Helder Wedge 're-discovered' the river in 1835 and at first called it the \"Peel\", but then changed it to the \"Ex\" or \"Exe\". Exford, an early crossing place on the river, is based on this name. One of the local Wautharong speaking Kulin tribesman that accompanied Wedge said the name for the stream was 'Weariby Yallock' ('yallock' meaning 'stream'). The spelling changed to the present form of \"Werribee. T\"he original aboriginal word meant \"spine\" or \"backbone\".\nThings to do.\nThere are many things to do along the river. A network of bike and walking trails along the river showcase the many different kinds of plants and animals that live along the river. \nThere are many fishing spots along the river. There are places to launch canoe and boats at the Werribee South Boat Ramp and Riverbend Historical Park.\nBird watching is also a popular activity. Care must be taken as there are Eastern Brown Snakes and other deadly fauna living near the river."}

It was used for movie theaters, screening rooms, home theaters, computer speakers, gaming consoles, and car audio systems.\nTHX stands for \"Tomlinson Holman's eXperiment\". THX was developed by Tomlinson Holman at George Lucas's company Lucasfilm in 1983 to ensure that the soundtrack for the third \"Star Wars\" movie, \"Return of the Jedi\", would be accurately reproduced in the best venues.\nThe THX system is not a recording technology, and it does not specify a sound recording format. All sound formats, whether digital (Dolby Digital, SDDS) or analog (Dolby SR, Ultra-Stereo), can be \"shown in THX.\" THX is mainly a quality assurance system. THX-certified theaters provide a high-quality, predictable playback environment to ensure that any movie soundtrack mixed in THX will sound as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer. THX also provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use is part of the standard. Certification of an auditorium entails specific acoustic and other technical requirements; architectural requirements include a floating floor, baffled and acoustically treated walls, no parallel walls (to reduce standing waves), a perforated screen (to allow center channel continuity), and NC30 rating for background noise.\nApplications.\nTHX sets strict standards for high quality sound and images.\nAccording to Tomlinson Holman, the inventor of the THX system, the name of the technology was deliberately chosen because it contained both a reference to his name, and to Lucas's early movie \"THX 1138\". The original name was \"Tom Holman's Crossover\" (Crossover being sometimes referred to as Xover) or the \"Tom Holman eXperiment.\"\nTHX Ltd., the company that licenses THX and the associated technology, is based in San Rafael, California, but has offices in Burbank and Hollywood.\nTHX launched a certification program for HD video products to ensure HD projectors, LCDs, plasmas and DVRs meet high standards for quality. The TiVo Series3 HD DVR and a number of projectors from Runco and Vidikron became the first THX Certified HD products.\nThe THX II Certified Car Audio System can be found in many Lincoln automobiles produced since 2003. The system was recently recognized among the Best Car Audio Systems of 2006 by the editors of CNET.\nTHX Ltd. started a licensing program for home screening rooms in 2005, which requires standards similar in concept, though not in detail, to its cinema certification program; before this happened, there was a very small number of (very expensive) home theatres which were actually constructed to THX Cinema standards, most notable of actor and comedian Eddie Murphy.\nThe world's largest THX cinema is the Colosseum Kino in Oslo, Norway.\nThe distinctive crescendo used in the THX trailers is known as the \"Deep Note.\"\nThe character in the THX trailers is called \"Tex\" and was created by John Lasseter at Pixar.\nThe THX trailer entitled \"Cimarron\", which first appeared at the start of the 1988 movie \"Willow\", used music composed by James Horner, while \"Grand\", which first appeared in theaters, featured a variation of the \"Deep Note\".\nThe THX Broadway logo on a DVD has a lower-pitched deep note, while the VHS/Laserdisc logo had a higher-pitched deep-note that was similar to \"Wings\" (1983).\nThe first theater THX was used in was at the University of Southern California's Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre as a part of USC's acclaimed film school. The Norris Theatre's THX system is currently second-best in California to that of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\nMovie references.\nSome trailers have references to, or are stylized to match, various movies and video games.

Over the years it has been remixed digitally which made the Deep Note with a more abridged sound. Beginning in 1988 the Deep Note became louder and abridged. In 1993 the Deep Note was cut short to save time for Laserdisc (1995 for VHS). Most recently, however, the Deep Note has been cut short to the single note (where both sounds stay in one pitch). This is in favor of other sound effects in certain THX logos.\nThe sound is perceived as louder than it actually is; sound designer Gary Rydstrom explains that, \"from a technical standpoint, 'Deep Note' just feels loud because it has a spectrum of frequencies that grows from small to large.\"\nJames A. Moorer has been quoted as saying, \"I like to say that the THX sound is the most widely-recognized piece of computer-generated music in the world. This may or may not be true, but it sounds cool!\"\nFurthermore,\nPrevious works.\nPrior to the creation of Deep Note, several other works made use of similar techniques of frequency spread.\nIn their book \"Analog Days\", Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco point to the track \"Spaced\", from the 1970 Beaver &amp; Krause album \"In a Wild Sanctuary\" as the source for Deep Note. They quote synthesizer builder Tom Oberheim as saying the original analog form is much richer than the \"digital perfection\" used in movie theatres.\nOther similar predecessors include:\nIn popular culture.\nThe perceived loudness of the Deep Note is frequently depicted as having actual destructive effects:"}

It was also the only Ally from South America to provide troops. The country made significant contributions to the war effort. They sent an expeditionary force to fight alongside the allies in the Italian Campaign. The Brazilian Navy and Air Force helped the Allies in the Atlantic from 1942 until the end of the war in 1945. \nBackground.\nAt the beginning of World War II Brazil was neutral. They traded with both the Allied and Axis Forces. But after 1939 the war made trade with Europe difficult. They turned to the United States as a trading partner. The Americans pressured Brazil to join the Allies. This led to the Joint Brazil-U.S Defense Commission, which was designed to counter Axis influence in South America. At the beginning of 1942 Brazil permitted the US to set up air bases on its soil. This came as an agreement that the US would help establishing a national steel industry in Brazil, the Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional. This would initially help supply the Allies industrial demand for steel, and after the war, contribute to the country\u2019s industrialization and development. \nBrazil also broke off diplomatic relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy. \nAs a result of Brazil\u00b4s decision, from the end of January to July 1942, German navy U-boats sank 13 Brazilian merchant ships, causing severe damage to Brazilian shipping. In total, 21 German and two Italian submarines caused the sinking of 36 Brazilian merchant ships causing 1,691 drownings and 1,079 other casualties. The sinkings were the main reason that led the Brazilian government to declare war against the Axis. Finally, Vargas declared war on both Germany and Italy on August 22 1942. It is known that 9 U-Boats were sunk off the Brazilian Coast over the course of the war.\nThe Smoking Cobras.\nThe Brazilian Expeditionary Force or BEF () was a force of about 25,344 men. They were organized as a division of the US Fifth Army. They were delayed in getting started by difficulties in getting organized. Some in Brazil thought the government was not that anxious to send troops into battle. A popular saying at the time was that it was more likely for \"snakes to smoke\" () than to get the BEF going. It is the same as the saying \"When pigs fly\", meaning it will probably never happen. When the BEF did enter the war, they proudly wore their arm patch showing a cobra with a pipe in its mouth. They called themselves the \"Smoking Cobras\". \nThey were organized as a standard American division. They wore American uniforms with Brazilian rank and unit markings. The BEF was divided into three battalions of 5,000 men each. They were the 1st, 6th and 11th regimental combat teams. Their record in Italy was impressive. At the Battle of Collecchio the BEF defeated the German 148th Division and the Italian Monte Rosa, San Marco and Italia divisions. They captured 14,700 troops and 800 officers (including 2 Generals). During the eight months of battle in Italy, the BEF captured a total of 20,573 Axis soldiers. Only 450 BEF troops and 13 officers died while fighting on the front.\nNavy and Air Force.\nThe Brazilian Navy and Air Force played a large role in the Battle of the Atlantic. They started in mid-1942 and operated until the end of the war in 1945. They performed anti-submarine and patrol operations in the South Atlantic. They had American ships through the Lend-Lease program. They acquired several submarine-chasers, 8 destroyer escorts and 3 Fleet destroyers. The larger destroyers were built in Rio de Janeiro to US designs. Their Air Force received a number of modern plane types. These included Curtiss P-36 Hawks, Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and North American B-25 Mitchells. For patrol aircraft they received Lockheed Hudsons, Lockheed Venturas and long range Consolidated PBY Catalina Flying boats. \nThe effect was almost immediate. Between July and December 1943 alone, the Brazilian Air Force and Navy destroyed six German submarines. Of the 7,000 Brazilian sailors who fought, about 500 were killed in action. During the war the Navy protected 3,164 merchant ships. Only three were sunk while under their protection. Air Force pilots flew a total of 2,550 sorties. They flew only 5% of the missions in theatre. But they destroyed 85% of the ammunition dumps, 36% of the fuel depots and 28% of the bridges while they were active."}

Along with its sister ship, the Musashi, they were the largest battleships ever built.\nSuper battleship.\nYamato was built at Kure, Japan. She entered service on 16 December 1941. It was one of five planned super battleships although only two were built: Yamato and Musashi. The allies had no clue Japan had built these monsters until they were first spotted.\nYamato was huge and displaced 62, 315 tons. Yamato had nine 18-inch guns which were the largest in the world at the time. She was long. Yamato's armor was thick. Her guns were her most feared weapons. They fired shells that weighed 3,200 pounds each (the size of a compact car!). They had a range of . Yamato was designed to fight and destroy US battleships.

But the Japanese, by their attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 proved aircraft carriers were now the most powerful weapon. This meant battleships were already out of date. When the war started, Yamato was the flagship of the Combined Fleet commander Isoroku Yamamoto. It spent much of 1942 defending Japanese shipping out of Truk. Torpedoed by a US submarine in 1943 it was under repair until 1944. Because attack from the air was now the main threat, Yamato was fitted with additional anti-aircraft guns. In June 1944 Yamato took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. In October Yamato was in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During the battle she fired her guns at US escort carriers thinking they were full sized carriers. She was attacked by several US destroyers and received some damage. Returning to Japan in November she was again fitted with more anti-aircraft guns. By then Japan no longer had the resources to keep Yamato operating. In 1945, Yamato left for Okinawa as part of the suicidal Operation Ten-Go. It was an effort to attack US ships supporting the Battle of Okinawa. But, off the coast of Kagoshima, it was sunk by U.S. aircraft on 7 April.\nAfter The War.\nAfter the war, the Yamato became a fascinating subject in Japan and elsewhere.

A database organized in terms of the relational model is called relational database.\nThe purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it. The structure in which the data is stored, and the task of responding to users' requests and retrieving the data is left to the database system, and is not visible to the user.\nMost relational databases use the SQL data definition and query language; these systems implement what can be regarded as an engineering approximation to the relational model. A \"table\" in an SQL database schema corresponds to a predicate variable; the contents of a table to a relation; key constraints, other constraints, and SQL queries correspond to predicates. Today, many database systems are different from the original model. Codd fiercely argued against deviations that compromise the original principles."}

While working at the Campbell Soup Company he discovered a method to create condensed soup. Dorrance served as president of the Campbell Soup Company from 1914 to 1930.\nEarly career.\nDorrance was born in Bristol, Pennsylvania November 11, 1873. His parents were John and Eleanor (Thompson) Dorrance. He earned a Bachelor of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received a PhD degree from the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany in 1897. Dorrance then returned to the United States to work for his uncle at the Joseph Cambell Preserve Company. His uncle started him at $7.50 per week. Dr. Dorrance also had to provide his own equipment and supplies for his laboratory. While studdying in Europe, Dorrance became used to having soup with his meals. He wanted to perfect a method of canning soup and adding it their product line. In 1897 he invented condensed soup. By removing the water it reduced the weight of the can. A lighter can cost less to transport to stores. The company was able to sell their condensed soup for 10 cents a can. The product was a success for the company. His uncle raised his pay to $9.00 a week. Dorrance also designed the now classic red and white label for Campbells Soup.\nRise to prominence.\nIn 1900 Dorrance became vice president of the Joseph Cambell Preserve Company. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris that year, Campbell's soups won a gold medal. The medal is still shown on the soup cans today. Dorrance found that workers had time on their hands watching the soup cook in the factory. To occupy their time Dorrance created a new product: canned pork and beans. In 1914 Dorrance became president of the company, now called the Campbell Soup Company. He died of a heart disease on September 22, 1930 in Camden, New Jersey."}

The term is sometimes also applied in soil development. \nThe idea of a single climatic climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with Frederic Clements in the early 1900s.

Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 64% of world uranium production. Uranium from mining is mostly used as fuel for nuclear power plants. Health and environmental studies show that radiation exposure poses a risk for uranium miners. In 1990, Congress passed legislation to help those affected by mining. As of July 2014, the price of uranium concentrate remained near a five-year low, the uranium price having fallen more than 50% from the peak price in January 2011, and reflecting loss of demand following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Some plans for new mines and mine expansion have been deferred.\nBackground.\nThe worldwide production of uranium in 2012 amounted to 58,000 tonnes. Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 64% of world uranium production. Other important uranium producing countries are Niger, Namibia, Russia, Uzbekistan, the United States, China, and Malawi.\nUranium from mining is mostly used as fuel for nuclear power plants. Uranium ores are normally processed by grinding the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder consisting of natural uranium, \"yellowcake,\" which is sold on the uranium market as U3O8.\nEnvironment.\nIn 1950, the US Public Health service began a comprehensive study of uranium miners, leading to the first publication of a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining, released in 1962. The federal government eventually regulated the standard amount of radon in mines, setting the level at 0.3 WL on January 1, 1969.\nOut of 50 present and former uranium milling sites in 12 states, 24 have been abandoned, and are the responsibility of the US Department of Energy. Accidental releases from uranium mills include the 1979 Church Rock uranium mill spill in New Mexico, called the largest accident of nuclear-related waste in US history, and the 1986 Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release in Oklahoma.\nIn 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), granting reparations for those affected by mining, with amendments passed in 2000 to address criticisms with the original act.\nEconomics.\nAs of July 2014, the price of uranium concentrate remained near a five-year low, the uranium price having fallen more than 50% from the peak price in January 2011, and reflecting loss of Japanese demand following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Because of continued low prices, in February 2014 mining company Cameco put back plans to expand production from existing Canadian mines, although it continued work to open a new mine at Cigar Lake. Also in February 2014, Paladin energy suspended operations at its mine in Malawi, saying that the high-cost operation was losing money at current prices."}

The Avro Tudor and Vickers VC.1 Viking was fitted with Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets. It had flown earlier but were experimental models. The jet was made by de Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters. The prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines buried in the wings. It had a pressurised fuselage. The jet had large square windows. It showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.\nThe original Comet was about the length of the later Boeing 737-100. It carried fewer people in a more comfortable environment. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet passenger cabin. The Comet had passengers like Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. Flights on the Comet were faster than on other advanced aircraft. In August 1953 BOAC scheduled nine-stop London to Tokyo flights by Comet for 36 hours. Other aircrafts took more than 86 hours. A special order Comet for the exclusive use of King Saud bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia was described as \"the world's first executive jet\". \nIn 1954, the Comets began suffering problems, with three of them breaking up during mid-flight in accidents. During its service, the Comet was involved in 13 fatal crashes which resulted in 426 fatalities. On 10 January 1954, the first Comet produced broke up in mid-air and crashed into the Mediterranean. All 35 persons on board died. On 8 April 1954, a Comet on charter to South African Airways crashed in the Mediterranean near Naples. All on board died. \nThe Comet was removed from service and tested to discover the cause. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square windows were noted. As a result, the Comet was redesigned into models 2, 3, and in 1958 the Comet 4. But meanwhile other aircraft designers had their own jets, the Boeing 707 in 1957 and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. In 1960, as part of a consolidation of the British aerospace industry, de Havilland was bought by Hawker Siddeley. Aviation author Bill Withun concluded that the Comet had pushed \"'state-of-the-art' beyond its limits.\" The only complete remaining Comet 1 is displayed at the RAF Museum Cosford."}

He did this to protest police brutality and racism against African Americans in the United States. At first, Kaepernick sat down while the anthem was played, but a former United States Army Green Beret named Nate Boyer told him to kneel on one knee instead because this is what soldiers do at the graves where dead soldiers are buried and because Boyer thought it was more respectful than sitting down.\nKaepernick became a national activist with support of many other professional athletes, but many teams did not want him with them because the fans did not like the protest.\nIn June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, National Football League Comissioner Roger Goodell said on Twitter: \"we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.

{"id": "469488", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=469488", "title": "Breakbeat", "text": "Breakbeat (also called breaks or breakbeats) refers to two things. It is both an electronic music genre and the distinct percussive rhythm from which this genre takes its name.\nEarly history.\nAs a musical device, breakbeats have been known and used for almost a hundred years. The name and modern meaning of the term traces its origins to the rise of hip hop in the United States during the 1980s. The electronic music genre is widely regarded as coming from the United Kingdom's early rave music. Breakbeats were added to the music to form what became known as breakbeat hardcore. However, breakbeats had been used by American hip hop DJs and turntablists in instrumental sets well before the advent of rave in the UK. It could be argued that the two scenes developed in parallel.\nToday, breakbeat lives on in the form of strong regional scenes in the US and UK. Breakbeats are frequently used in the production of such diverse music genres as hip hop, jungle or drum and bass, hardcore, UK garage (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep). Since the 1990s, breakbeat has been used as background music to TV adverts. It also has been used in action film soundtracks.\nEtymology.\nThe most likely origin of the word \"breakbeat\" is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a \"break\" in the music. a\nIn the early 1990s, acid house artists and producers started using breakbeat samples in their music to create breakbeat hardcore. This was also calledrave music. The hardcore scene then diverged into sub-genres like jungle and drum and bass, which generally had a darker sound and focused more on complex sampled drum patterns. An example of this is Goldie's album \"Timeless\".\nEvolution.\nIn the 1980s, breakbeat became an essential feature of many genres of breaks music which became popular within the global dance music scene, including big beat, nu skool breaks, acid breaks and Miami bass.\nDJs from a variety of genres work breaks tracks into their sets. This may occur because the tempo of breaks tracks (ranging from 110 to 150 beats per minute) means they can be readily mixed with these genres.\nSome artists well known for breakbeat include Afrika Bambaataa, Whodini, Davy DMX, Deekline, Dynamix II, 2 Live Crew, Cybotron, Nubreed, Hybrid, Phil K, Dirty Harry, NAPT, DJ Icey, Stanton Warriors, FreQ Nasty, Krafty Kuts, Freestylers, K-Swing, Soul Of Man, DJ Sharaz, Annie Nightingale and performance troupe Lucent Dossier Experience.\nBreakbeats are used in many hip hop, jungle and hardcore songs. It can also be heard in other music, from popular music to background music in car, and jean commercials on the radio or TV.\nThe \"Amen Break\".\nThe Amen Break, a drum break from The Winstons' song \"Amen, Brother\" is widely regarded as one of the most widely used and sampled breaks among music using breakbeats. This break was first used on \"King of the Beats\" by Mantronix, and has since been used in thousands of songs. Other popular breaks are from James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" (1970) and \"Give it Up or Turnit a Loose\", The Incredible Bongo Band's 1973 cover of The Shadows' \"Apache\", and Lyn Collins' 1972 song \"Think (About It)\".\nLegal issues.\nWith the rise in popularity of breakbeat music and the advent of digital audio samplers, enterprising companies started selling \"breakbeat packages\" for the express purpose of helping artists create breakbeats. A breakbeat kit CD would contain many breakbeat samples from different songs and artists, often without the artist's permission or even knowledge. One example of this is the Amen Break, from a song by The Winstons, who hold the copyright. However, a company named Zero-G Limited released a \"jungle construction kit\" containing hundreds of audio samples. One appeared to be an exact copy of the Amen break. It was slightly sped up. Zero-G Limited claimed copyright since a copyright symbol was included on the product's packaging. However, when it came to Zero-G Limited's notice that there may be another claim on the copyright of the audio sample in question, they removed it from the product. The Winstons have not received royalties for third-party use of samples of the break recorded on their original music release.\nSubgenres.\nBig beat.\nBig beat is a term employed since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe much of the music by artists such as The Prodigy, Cut La Roc, Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method and Propellerheads. \nAcid breaks.\nIn electronic music, \"acid breaks\" is a fusion between breakbeat, and other forms of electronic dance music Its drum line usually mimics most breakbeat music, but lacks the distinctive kick drum of other forms of EDM. One of the earliest synthesizers to be employed in acid music was the Roland TB-303. \nIn more recent times, artists such as Champion Breaks have started a resurgence of this sound, using mainly Amen breaks, Reese bass, and 303 acid lines to create energetic, and sometimes frenetic acid breaks songs."}

One way to discover that joy, is by what they call \"mindful\" meditation. Which is a type of meditation that concentrates on your breathing and embracing everything that comes up on your consciousness, without interpreting it with thought and critisism. But accompanying it with the great power of forgiveness, understanding and realisation of the present moment, which is also a very important point of reference in his teachings. "}

It generally means pulling back forces while maintaining contact with the enemy. There are several reasons why a military force would retreat. A force might pull back to occupy ground that is easier to defend. A retreat may be used to lead an enemy into an ambush. It may be moving back as quickly as possible in order to save your army from defeat. A withdrawal or retreat can be risky. It requires discipline to keep forces organized and not turn a retreat into a rout. Care must also be taken so a retreat does not damage a force's morale.\nTactical withdrawal.\nA withdrawal may be necessary when a defending force is outmatched or on disadvantageous ground. But it is usually important to cause as much damage to an enemy as possible. In such a case, the retreating force may employ a number of tactics and strategies. These are to slow an enemy's progress. This could include setting mines or booby traps during or before withdrawal. Sometimes ambush by a small force can slow or stop an enemy advance. Also, leading the enemy into prepared artillery barrages, or the use of scorched earth tactics.\nRout.\nIn warfare, the long-term strategy is the defeat of the enemy. An effective tactical method is to demoralize the enemy. This is usually done by defeating their army. This is also done by routing them from the battlefield. Once a force had become disorganized it loses its ability to fight as a unit. The victors can chase down the fleeing soldiers. The victors can also attempt to cause as many casualties as possible. They also may try to take as many prisoners as possible.\nHowever a commander must decide if the advantages of a pursuit is worth the risk the enemy is only pretending to retreat (a \"feigned\" retreat is an effective tactic).\nFeigned retreat.\nThe act of feigning a withdrawal or rout is to lure an enemy away from a defended position. It may lure them into a prepared ambush. It is an ancient tactic, and has been used throughout the history of warfare.\nTwo famous examples are:\nOccupied withdrawal.\nWithdrawal of a military occupation may be due to political reasons. The purpose of 'Troop withdrawal' from occupied lands may not involve engagement with an enemy. It may be conducted during a period of ceasefire or relative peace, as in the cases of Palestine."}

According to this theory media messages are powerful forces and audiences are powerless to resist them. The theory was popular during the 1940s and 1950s. Ideas about the power of the mass media were based on historical events. One was the role played by the Hearst Newspapers in getting public support for the Spanish-American War. Another was the powerful Nazi propaganda campaigns by Joseph Goebbels in World War II. Still another was the idea of a powerful Madison Avenue advertising influence on consumer buying and voting. Later researchers determined the theory was just too simple and too general to be accurate.\nMost modern media scholars think the theory is mostly false. However, many Americans still believe the mass media has unlimited power to control people's minds. In effect they believe the myth that if the mass media tells people to jump, the only question will be how high."}

Both players are given eight ghosts, of which four are good (marked by a blue dot) and four are evil (marked by a red dot). The ghosts are assembled in two rows of four at the player's own edge of the board. At each of the four corners is an exit from the castle.\nThe idea of the game is that neither player knows which of the other player's ghosts are good and which are evil. Facing the front, all ghosts look the same. The dots are only on the back. The players can arrange the good and evil ghosts how they wish at the start of the game.\nThe game is turn-based. On his or her turn, each player moves one ghost one square, either up, down, left or right. A ghost may capture an opponent's ghost by moving to its square. Only when a ghost is captured does the opposing player know whether it is good or evil.\nIf a player captures all four of the opposing player's good ghosts, he or she has won the game. But if a player captures all four of the opposing player's evil ghosts, he or she has lost the game. The game can also be won by moving one of the good ghosts through one of the exits at the opposing side of the board.\nThe strategy of the game play involves mainly trying to guess which of the opponent's ghosts are which by their movement patterns and trying to fool the opponent with confusing movement patterns."}

His plan was to protect French trade, undermine Britain's access to India, and to establish scientific enterprise in the region. It was the main reason for his Mediterranean campaign of 1798, a series of naval engagements that included the capture of Malta. In July he defeated British and Mameluke forces in the Battle of the Pyramids and took control of Egypt. \nThe British responded. In the Battle of the Nile, 1798, the Royal Navy, under Horatio Nelson, defeated the French fleet off the coast of Egypt. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed, and that changed the balance of power between the two nations at war in the Mediterranean. \nOn land in Egypt the French were opposed by a joint force of British and Ottoman troops. Defeated, the French retreated to Alexandria, the second city of Egypt, where the British-led force surrounded them. On 30 August 1801 the French general Abdullah Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou offered to surrender and proposed terms. The terms were adjusted, then agreed.

The Student's \"t\"-distribution also arises in the Bayesian analysis of data from a normal family.\nHistory.\nGosset worked at a brewery and was interested in the problems of small samples, for example the chemical properties of barley. In the problems he analyzed, the sample size might be as low as three. Because of the small sample size, estimating the standard deviation is not possible. Also, in many cases Gosset encountered, the probability distribution of the samples was not known.\nOne version of the origin of the pseudonym is that Gosset's employer preferred staff to use pen names (instead of their real name) when publishing scientific papers, so he used the name \"Student\" to hide his identity. Another version is that the brewery did not want their competitors to know that they were using the \"t\"-test to test the quality of raw material.\nProperties.\nIf we take a sample of \"n\" observations from a normal distribution, then the \"t\"-distribution with \"\u03bd = n\u22121\" degrees of freedom can be defined as the distribution of the location of the sample mean formula_6, relative to the true mean formula_7, divided by the sample standard deviation formula_8 over the normalizing term formula_9 (that is, formula_10). In this way, the \"t\"-distribution can be used to estimate how likely it is that the true mean lies in any given range.\nThe \"t\"-distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, like the normal distribution, but has heavier tails, meaning that it is more prone to producing values that fall far from its mean. This makes it useful for understanding the statistical behavior of certain types of ratios of random quantities, in which variation in the denominator is amplified and may produce outlying values when the denominator of the ratio falls close to zero. The Student's \"t\"-distribution is a special case of the generalised hyperbolic distribution."}

It can be used to describe a person with a working class background. Or it can be someone whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour display a proud working class attitude. Sometimes the word can have a negative meaning. Over the last several decades, the bogan has become a very widespread and well respected group. There are many local names that describe the same or similar groups of people.\nDefinition.\nBogans are often thought to be people who live in the outer suburbs of larger cities. They are less keen on dental hygiene than others. They also tend to be anti-authority, proud of their country, have home done tattoos, love classic rock, love Peter Brock, hoon around and drink a lot of alcohol. A bogan attitude is not pretentious and is very honest.\nSome types of clothing are associated with bogans. These include flannelette shirts, monkey hoodies, Stubbies shorts, King Gee workwear, thongs and Ugg boots. They also wear jeans and black leggings. Victorian Bogans typically wear acid wash jeans, ugg boots, and band T-shirts with mullet style haircuts. In the mid 1990s, New Zealand Bogans were typically dressed in all black. Super-taper black jeans were fairly standard and black woollen jerseys. Long fringe or long hair in general was also common.\nVehicles such as the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon, are also common among bogans.\nBogans typically do not copy middle-class styles of taste, diet, hobbies, fashion and language. Bogans are sometimes looked down upon by some other groups. This can make the lives of disadvantaged people much tougher.\nPositive use.\nThe term bogan is nowadays used to display a pride in being rough around the edges. In 2002, Michelle Griffin discussed the fact that \u2018bogan\u2019 is no longer being used as an insult. It is in fact a way to identify with the \u2018Aussie\u2019 culture that many Anglo\u2010Saxon Australian citizens are so proud of. In the past, bogan was a bad term. Now many take pride in being called a bogan. Radio station Triple J held a \"National Bogan Day\" on 28 June 2002, which they commemorated by playing music by bands such as Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and AC/DC."}

It replaced the Imperial German Navy of World War I and the inter-war \"Reichsmarine\". The \"Kriegsmarine\" was one of three official branches of the \"Wehrmacht\", the armed forces of Nazi Germany.\nHistory.\nThe \"Kriegsmarine\" was developed during the German naval rearmament of the 1930s. The Treaty of Versailles had limited the size of the German navy after World War I. It also prevented Germany from building submarines. But by 1934 Germany had secretly most of the parts they needed to construct submarines (called U-boats). In early 1935 Hitler ordered the U-boats to be built. In January 1939 Plan Z was ordered, calling for the construction of many naval vessels. The ships of the \"Kriegsmarine\" fought during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. The commander of the \"Kriegsmarine\" was Karl D\u00f6nitz.\nShips.\nThe Kriegsmarine's most famous ships were the U-boats. Most of them were built after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II. Wolfpacks were groups of submarines that attacked British convoys. Most of the attacks were during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic. Along with the U-boats, commerce raiders and cruisers were used to disrupt Allied shipping in the early years of the war. The most famous of these were the heavy cruisers \"Admiral Graf Spee\" and \"Admiral Scheer\" and the battleship \"Bismarck\". However, the allied adoption of convoy escorts greatly reduced the danger from commerce raiders."}

Such a variable is called statistically significant if under a certain status quo assumption, the probability of obtaining its outcome (or a more extreme outcome) is less than a given value. Statistical significance is hence a way of determining the \"unlikeliness\" of an experimental result\u2014when a certain status quo assumption is assumed to be true. Statistical hypothesis tests are used to check significance. \nThe concept of statistical significance was originated by Ronald Fisher in his 1925 publication, \"Statistical Methods for Research Workers\", when he developed statistical hypothesis testing (which he described as \"tests of significance\"). Fisher suggested a probability of one in twenty (0.05 or 5%)\u2014as a convenient cutoff level to reject the null hypothesis. In their 1933 paper, Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson recommended that the significance level (for example 0.05), which they called \u03b1, be set before any data collection.\nDespite his initial suggestion of 0.05 as a significance level, Fisher did not intend this cutoff value to be fixed. In his 1956 publication \"Statistical methods and scientific inference\", he recommended that significant levels be set according to specific circumstances."}

On July 2, 2015, Webb announced that we will run for president in 2016. He suspended his campaign and withdrew from the election on October 20, 2015.\nEarly life.\nWebb was born in St. Joseph, Missouri. His father, James Henry Webb, served in the United States Air Force. His mother, Vera Lorraine Hodges, was a housewife. His family descended from Irish-Scots immigrants. Webb went to many schools in the U.S. and in England. He was raised in Bellevue, Nebraska.\nWebb graduated from the University of Southern California, Georgetown University Law Center, and from the United States Naval Academy.\nEarly career.\nCommittee on Veterans Affairs (1977-1981).\nFrom 1977 to 1981, Webb worked on the staff of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.

He was gravely concerned with the disarray the Marines had fallen into post-Vietnam: drug use, racial infighting, and low morale within the Corps left him with the impression it was no longer America's premier fighting force.\nUnited States Secretary of the Navy (1987-1988).\nIn 1987, he served as Secretary of the Navy, becoming the first Naval Academy graduate to serve as the civilian head of the Navy. As Navy Secretary, Webb pushed the appointment of Alfred M. Gray Jr. as Commandant of the Marine Corps, hoping that Gray could reshape the Corps into the elite unit it once was.\nWebb resigned in 1988 after refusing to agree to reduce the size of the Navy. Webb had wished to increase the Navy to 600 ships. As revealed in \"The Reagan Diaries\", President Ronald Reagan wrote on February 22, 1988: \"I don't think Navy was sorry to see him go.\"\nAfter his resignation, Webb earned his living primarily as an author and filmmaker.

Webb won with 53.5% of the vote, in a race with low turnout. On January 4, 2007, Webb was sworn into the 110th U.S. Senate, accompanied by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a fellow former Secretary of the Navy; and former Virginia Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb, who held the same seat before losing to Allen.\nOn November 15, 2006, Senate majority-leader-in-waiting Harry Reid assigned Webb to three committees: the committees on Foreign Relations, Veterans' Affairs, and Armed Services.\nOn January 23, 2007, Webb delivered the Democratic response to the President's State of the Union address, focusing on the economy and Iraq. Webb's speech drew positive reviews, and was regarded as one of the stronger State of the Union responses in recent memory. Webb, a decorated war veteran, spoke of his family\u2019s military past, his own passionate attachment to the military, and the way in which previous presidents had always attempted to ensure that all precautions had been taken when sending young Americans into harm's way.\nOn August 14, 2009 Webb visited Myanmar (Burma), seeing its junta's leader, Gen. Than Shwe, and also the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest. During Webb's visit with Than Shwe, Webb negotiated the release and deportation of an imprisoned American, John Yettaw.\nOn February 9, 2011, Webb announced that he would not run for re-election of his Senate seat in 2012.\n2016 presidential campaign.\nOn November 19, 2014, Webb announced the formation of an exploratory committee in preparation for a possible bid for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in 2016.

They have long weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species. They have black faces with white markings and grey bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail. They have dark legs with light coloured underbellies. They grow to around in length including the tail. The European badger is one of the largest badgers. The American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are a little smaller and lighter. They weigh around 9.1\u201311 kg (20\u201324 lb) on average, with some badgers in Europe and Asia weighing about 18 kg (40 lb)\nA male badger is called a boar. A female is called a sow. A young badger is called a cub. \nDistribution.\nBadgers are found in North America, Ireland, Britain and most of Europe. The Javan ferret-badger lives in Indonesia. The Bornean ferret-badger lives in Malaysia. The honey badger is found in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Desert, southern Levant, Turkmenistan, and India.\nBehavior.\nBadgers all live underground. They live in burrows called setts, which may be very large. Some live on their own, moving from home to home. Others are known to form family groups called \"cetes\". Between two and fifteen badgers can live in a cete at one time. Badgers can run or gallop at speeds of up to 25\u201330 km/h (16\u201319 mph) for short periods of time. Badgers are only active at night. They can dig a hole fast enough to escape most predators. They fill in the hole behind them as they dig.\nFood.\nThe badger\u2019s diet is mainly small mammals; mice, gophers and squirrels. They eat amphibians, reptiles and birds. Badgers also eat earthworms, insects, grubs, and bird eggs. They will sometimes eat roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the main predator of hedgehogs. Badgers have been known to become drunk from the alcohol found in rotting fruit."}

Blood substitutes are often used in blood transfusions where real blood is not available. Losing a lot of blood can mean there is not enough blood left to keep up the oxygen transfer to certain organs, or the brain. This state is a medical emergency, as it can lead to organ failure and death. Blood substitutes can help in these situations.\nTypes.\nThere are two basic types of blood substitutes:\nAn oxygen-carrying blood substitute, or artificial haemoglobin, is an artificially made red substitute whose main function is to carry oxygen, as does natural haemoglobin.\nThe first goal of oxygen carrying blood substitutes is just to mimic blood's oxygen transport capacity. Unfortunately, oxygen transport, one function that distinguishes real blood from other \"volume expanders\", has been very difficult to reproduce.\nReasons for use.\nThere are some good reasons why the world needs blood substitutes:\nSince oxygen therapeutics are not yet widely available, the United States Army is experimenting with varieties of dried blood, which take up less room, weigh less and can be used much longer than blood plasma. Saline has to be added before use. Dried blood is better for first aid during combat than whole blood or packed red cells."}

The pamphlet bears the name of Mikhail Bakunin, a well-known anarchist, but it is thought all or most of it is by Nechayev. The work called for total devotion to a revolutionary lifestyle. \"The Catechism of a Revolutionary\" argued that any means (including blackmail and murder) could be used to advance the cause of revolution.\nIt was published in the \"Government Herald\" in July 1871 as the manifesto of a secret society.\n\"Catechism of a Revolutionary\" was a program for the \"merciless destruction\" of society and the state. The main principle was \"the ends justify the means\". This became Nechayev's slogan throughout his revolutionary career. \nBakunin.\nNechayev and Bakunin knew each other, and Bakunin called him \"my boy\". All the same, Nechayev was dangerous, and Bakunin was somewhat afraid of him.\nDostoyevsky.\nNechayev's ideas were the basis for Dostoyevsky's \"The Demons\" (aka \"The Possessed\"). Dostoyevsky had himself been a young nihilist, and spent ten years in a Siberian labour camp as a result. He came back a determined enemy of everything Nechayev believed. \"The Demons\" is a \"dark comedy, cruelly funny in its depiction of high-minded intellectuals toying with revolutionary notions without understanding anything of what revolution means in practice\".\nNechayev's fate.\nNechayev planned to kill a student, Ivanov, who questioned his ideas. On 21 November 1869, Nechayev and several comrades beat, strangled and shot Ivanov, hiding the body in a lake through a hole in the ice. The student's body was found and Nechayev fled the country before he could be arrested.\nIn August 1872, Nechayev was arrested in Zurich and handed over to the Russian police. He was found guilty on 8 January 1873, and sentenced to 20 years of hard labor for killing Ivanov.\nHe died in his prison cell in 1882.\nAssessments.\nIt has been said of Nechayev: \"His personality and ideas portray, as if in a crooked mirror, the lust for revolution reaching even beyond political fanaticism into insanity. With Nechayev we are already beyond Lenin, [and] so criminal as to forecast the darkest incidents of Stalin\".\nBiographers of Lenin have said that Lenin put into practice what Nechayev had taught. There is clear evidence in Lenin's own writing that this is so."}

Gij\u00f3n has a population of 275,274 inhabitants, more than any other city in Asturias.\nHistory.\nFor most of its history Gij\u00f3n was just a small town and seaport. After the conquest of the Asturias in the 3rd century BC by the Romans they called the site \"Gigia\". in 714 a garrison was established by the Moors. From here they attacked the Asturias but failed in the attempt. After the Moors left, Gij\u00f3n was ruled by Asturian kings. In the 10th century the Asturias became part of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. In the 16th century the harbor was improved under Philip II of Spain. Some of the ships of the Spanish Armada took shelter at Gij\u00f3n's port in a violent storm. They were on their way to attack Britain in 1588. After the epic battle, a few of the remaining ships limped back to Gij\u00f3n. During the last half of the 19th century a railroad was built to Gij\u00f3n to ship Asturian coal to other parts of Spain. This was the start of Gij\u00f3n becoming a large industrial center. During the Spanish Civil War part of Gij\u00f3n was destroyed. \nModern Gij\u00f3n.\nGij\u00f3n is famous for its beaches. In the summer newer parts of town resemble a carnival much like Coney Island. Every November the Gij\u00f3n International Film Festival is held. The main stage is the Jovellanos Theatre, although other cinemas and cultural centres are also used."}

The first crates used to transport anything were hampers or baskets. They were made of twigs, strips of wood, roots, and reeds. Whatever was available that could be woven into a container.

It is partly responsible for the high volcanic activity which has formed the island of Iceland.\nIceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world. On Iceland, there are volcanic eruptions about every three years. In the 20th century there were 39 volcanic eruptions on and around Iceland. About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history were produced by Icelandic eruptions. \nNotable eruptions have included that of Eldgj\u00e1, a fissure of Katla, in 934 (the world's largest basaltic eruption ever witnessed), and Laki in 1783 (the world's second largest). In many places, Iceland is covered by glaciers. Several eruptions under ice caps have burst through the ice. The most recent one was in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.\nIceland's position over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity. It is not understood why Iceland is an island, but the rest of the ridge consists of seamounts, with peaks below sea level.\nCauses.\nThere is discussion whether the hotspot is caused by a deep mantle plume or at a shallower depth.\nSome geologists have asked whether the Iceland hotspot has the same cause as other hotspots such as the Hawaii hotspot. They show a clear volcanic track over time caused by the movement of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaiian hotspot, but no such track can be seen at Iceland.\nThe line from the Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn volcano to Surtsey may show the movement of the Eurasian Plate and the line from the Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn volcano to the Sn\u00e6fellsnes volcanic belt shows the movement of the North American Plate."}

They grew staple food crops. These included grains such as emmer (a variety of wheat) and barley. The earliest evidence of irrigation in the Nile area is about 3100\u00a0BC.\nThey also grew flax for clothing and oil. Orchards\nand vegetable gardens were also common. Unlike other crops these were grown away from the areas flooded by the Nile river each year. Agriculture was the basis of the ancient Egyptian economy. It gave work and food for its people. It was a source of wealth for Egypt's elite. Egypt was the breadbasket (main provider of food) for much of the ancient world.\nGeography.\nThe geography of ancient Egypt was unlike that in other parts of the Mediterranean region, which had rainy winters and hot dry summers. In Egypt most of farming was done near in the Nile river valley and the Nile Delta. Egypt had little rainfall and the land had to be irrigated. This was from the Nile either when flooded or normally.\nThe Nile began to rise in the summer and go down again in late fall. The growing season was during the winter months. It was called \"Sha-et\" (the growing season). The second season was called \"P' ru-et\" (the dry season). This is the hot dry season when the grain was harvested and stored. The third season, \"She\" (sea) was the months during which the Nile flooded. Each season was about four months long. The fertile Nile valley is about 760\u00a0miles long and about 14\u00a0miles wide. The rest of Egypt is desert.\nThis system allowed one crop a year. A shorter agricultural season meant more workers available for construction of buildings like temples and other royal buildings. Workers were also used for year-round irrigation projects. Water was usually carried manually on men's shoulders using yokes.\nCrops.\nTo plant, they dug a hole in the ground, and put one seed in each hole. They used furrows. They grew wheat, barley, vegetables, figs, melons, pomegranates and vines. Crops were very important to Egyptians. They grew lettuce, cucumber, wheat, barley, figs, pomegranate and beans. Shemu was the harvesting season. Peret was the growing season. Akhet was the flooding season. In October, the river Nile left a layer of soil. Kemet is left behind from flooding. They grew their crops on the edge of the bank on the river Nile, then they waited for the Nile to flood and then all was left was soil to plant there crops.\nHarvest.\nThe harvest season was called \"Shemu\". The reapers cut the grain with wooden sickles that had sharp flints. The cattle trampled over the cut grain. They tossed grain into the air so the breeze blew the useless chaff away. It was hard and slow. Harvest takes place in spring but finishes in May. Families hired workers to do the job. Everyone took part in harvest. Farmers had to barter. Many of them harvested crops to trade for the things and animals they needed to plant more crops.\nTools.\nAncient Egyptians had tools like winnowing scoops, mattocks, flint bladed sickles and plows. All of the tools were simple and made by hand. The Egyptian plow had a small blade on it but did not cut the soil.\nShadufs.\nA Shaduf is an object used to collect water from the river Nile. The Shaduf works by pulling the string at the front and at the back there is a weight to stop it from falling forwards. Shadufs are used to get the water out of the Nile to water the crops.\nAnimals.\nThe Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.p117 Cattle were the most important livestock; livestock were taxed; the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple which owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry such as ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.p381 The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and they provided both honey and wax.p409\nThe ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden. They plowed the fields and trampled seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was part of an offering ritual.p381 Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, and the camel, although known from the New Kingdom, was not used as a beast of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly used in the Late Period, but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land. Dogs, cats and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses. During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.p229"}

Canadian Club was created by Gooderham and Worts. It is currently being produced by Beam Suntory.\nHistory.\nCanadian Club started being made in 1858. The first distillery was created in Walkerville, Ontario. They decided to create the distillery in Walkerville because of the good quality of the local grains that were there.\nThe whisky was popular in the late 19th century in gentlemen's clubs of Canada and the United States. It was known as \"Club Whisky\" because of this. After it became very popular, American distillers decided to petition to include the word \"Canada\" on the bottle to identify it from their competing whiskies. By doing this, they thought that it would stop the popularity of the whisky. However, this made the whisky even more exclusive. In 1889, Walker changed the label and added the word \u201cCanadian\u201d to the top of the label. In 1890, the label was changed again, with \"Canadian\" being moved down from the top of the label and incorporated into the name of the whisky.\nDuring the Prohibition years, one of Canadian Club's most important clients was gangster Al Capone. He would smuggle thousands of cases of Canadian Club through a route from Windsor to Detroit.\nThe whisky has received royal warrants from Queen Victoria, Edward VII, George V, George VI, and Elizabeth II. Hiram Walker &amp; Sons were the only North American distiller to receive a royal warrant."}

This area is now part of North-West Pakistan. \nZabardust Khan was appointed a \"nazim\" (area administrator) in upper Hazara, Kashmir by the Afghan King Taimur Shah Durrani (or Abdali) in 1775 or 1776. This name \"Suba\" was given by Afghan King Ahmed shah abdali know as (Khan of Suba) i.e Subahdar. He was a good administrator at a very violent and bad time in history. He tried his best to help people, ensure peace in his area and control prices of food and other goods. For this reason, he is still remembered by people in that area today. \n &lt;br&gt; One of the Zamburak of Suba Khan Tanoli used in Third battle of Panipat\nZabardust/Suba Khan Tanoli died in 1797. He is not to be confused with a Pathan soldier called Zabardast Khan, who fought at the Third Battle of Panipat.\nTomb location.\nA crumbling structure adorned with faded frescoes, enclosed by an imposing boundary wall is all that remains of Subah Khan\u2019s mausoleum in the quiet village of Pohaar, about 36 kilometres north of Haripur in KP. It took around 40 minutes to reach there from Haripur, through a scenic route along the Tarbela Lake known as Chappar Road.\nHistory.\nSubah Khan was born to Bahadar Khan Tanoli in the hilly trans-Indus region of Tanawal in KP in the first half of the 18th century. According to reliable oral traditions, Subah Khan\u2019s ancestral elders from the Tanoli tribe had attracted the wrath of the mighty Mughal Empire by launching attacks on imperial forces and convoys in the region from their remote villages in Tanawal. \nSubah Khan Tanoli\u2019s elders held out in fortified mountain villages during Emperor Aurangzeb\u2019s rule.\nAs the Mughal Empire\u2019s control weakened, communities across the subcontinent found themselves with more political space and economic freedom to assert their power in ways that had not been possible earlier.\nWhen Ahmad Shah Abdali announced his plans to invade Hindustan, he found in Subah Khan a young warrior who was keen to join his army with his clansmen.\nStories of Subah Khan\u2019s adventures and valour in the Battle of Mathura, fought between Ahmad Shah Abdali and the Hindu Jats in 1757, live on through folklore in the villages of Tanawal.\nOn more than a few occasions, I met old men recounting tales of how their elders carried zamburaks (swivel guns) to battle alongside the Afghan king. Some of these centuries-old zamburaks are still scattered around the region.\nA centuries-old zamburak (swivel gun) used by Subah Khan Tanoli\u2019s clansmen while fighting alongside Ahmad Shah Abdali at Mathura in 1757.\nDescendants of Subah Khan It was a certificate from the Afghan king to Zabardast Khan Tanoli, conferring on him the title of Subah Khan for his support in the Indian campaigns, particularly in the fighting around Mathura.\nAccording to the aging manuscript, Abdali awarded Subah Khan Rs12,000 and an annual jagir (grant) of Rs2,000, along with the right to tax caravans travelling between Kabul and Kashmir on the Tanawal route.\nThis can also be corroborated by the independent travel accounts of the British East India Company officer George Forster. While travelling through the region in July 1783, Forster saw trade caravans being taxed on the orders of Subah Khan\u2019s son.\nThe Third Battle of Panipat (1761) between Ahmad Shah Abdali and the Marathas.\u2014Courtesy British Library\nFirsthand accounts from Abdali\u2019s own army offer grim portraits of the battle and subsequent sacking of the city of Mathura in 1757:\n\u201cWherever you gazed you beheld heaps of the slain; you could only pick your way with difficulty, owing to the quantity of bodies lying about and the amount of blood spilt. At one place that we reached we saw about two hundred dead children lying in a heap. Not one of the dead bodies had a head. The stench and effluvium in the air were such that it was painful to open your mouth or even to draw breath.\u201d\nAlthough Abdali\u2019s patronage elevated Subah Khan\u2019s status to one of Hazara\u2019s most powerful chiefs, the scenes he witnessed in the wars were to leave a long-lasting impression on him.\nAfter returning home, he donated all the land in his capital at Mangal (on the skirts of modern-day Abbottabad) to a Sufi mystic and made the mountains his home.\nSubah Khan dedicated the rest of his life to building new towns at Birkund and Bir (in districts Mansehra and Haripur). The new settlements were named after Bir Deva, the mythical Gandharan ancestor of the Tanoli tribe.\nAccording to Hazara\u2019s first historian, Lala Mehtab Singh (1846), after returning home from the Indian campaigns, Subah Khan settled a large number of Hindu and Sikh Khatri merchant families in Bir to develop his new town as a hub for trade and commerce.\nOn one occasion, when the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh citizens of Bir celebrated the birth of a child in Khan\u2019s family, they were told that the news of a new settler in Subah Khan\u2019s town would be more welcome to him than the expansion of his own bloodline.\nMehtab Singh\u2019s records also mention that Subah Khan\u2019s son, Gul Sher Khan, donated Rs2,000 to help the Hindu families in Bir build a place of worship for themselves.\nThe town of Bir was founded by Subah Khan after he returned from Abdali\u2019s India campaigns.\nThe Indus at Amb-Darband, the now-submerged capital of the state of Amb.\nAbdali\u2019s invasions are a polarising topic of discussion in India and Pakistan today. Nationalist historians and commentators on both sides prefer viewing the conflict as a simplistic clash of faiths, rather than as a violent competition for power and resources.\nThis binary view of history makes it hard to capture the nuances and human stories of the participants and victims of the wars.\nThe substantial economic and political concessions granted by Abdali to Subah Khan enabled his descendants and clansmen to consolidate their power in Tanawal.\nIn the decades following Durrani rule, they would fiercely resist both the Sikh general Hari Singh Nalwa and Islamist reformer Syed Ahmed Barelvi\u2019s attempts to control the region.\nIn 1858, the British would formally recognise the region as the state of Amb, a semi-independent tribal princely state along the Indus with its capital at the now submerged towns of Amb and Darband.\nTomb of Suba Khan.\n\"The last of Subah Khan Tanoli\u2019s mid-18th century mausoleum.\"\n\"Crumbling Tomb of Suba Khan\". \n\"Grave View of Suba Khan.\"\n\"Entrance gate of Tomb\"\nTomb of Suba Khan Tanoli badly damaged under sikh invasion."}

Starting at age 16 he studied botany under Heinrich Goppert at the University of Breslau. He then moved to the University of Berlin. At age 19 in 1847 he received a degree in botany at Berlin. \nIn 1849 he returned to the University of Breslau and he remained at that university for the rest of his career as a teacher and researcher. His father had bought for him a large and expensive microscope, which the University of Breslau and most universities did not have at that time. They had microscopes, but not so good as his. It was Ferdinand Cohn's main research tool in the 1850s. \nIn the 1850s he studied the growth and division of plant cells. In 1855 he produced papers on the sexuality of \"Sphaeroplea\" and later \"Volvox\". In the 1860s he studied plant physiology. Cohn was the first to classify algae as plants, and to define what distinguishes them from green plants. \nFrom 1870 onward he mostly studied bacteria. He published over 150 research reports during his lifetime. The University of Breslau became an innovative center for plant physiology and microbiology while he was there. His classification of bacteria into four groups based on shape (sphericals, short rods, threads, and spirals) is still in use today. \nAmong other things Cohn showed that \"Bacillus\" can change from a vegetative state to an endospore when conditions are hard. Heat resistant spores of \"B. subtilis\" caused a controversy over spontaneous generation. Cohn explained why boiled infusions of hay and cheese could still get microbial growth. It was because they contained heat resistant spores."}

Supinfocom is a university in France. The university has a audiovisual and computer graphics program. Campuses are in Valenciennes, Arles and Pune. The school offers a five-year course of study that leads to a diploma of digital direction to its students, Matthieu Bernadat, Marion Petegnief, Nils Boussuge, Florence Ciuccoli, and Clement Deltour.\nMaking of the movie.\nThe movie was made in the genre of animated movies. The movie was made in the bizarre sub-genre. The movie was shot in 3-D. Illness and handicapped children were both themes in the movie. The movie was made all in Ukrainian. French translations were done by Roman Kozin and Nadia Myhal. The running time of the short movie was 6 minutes and 54 seconds. The screen format of the movie was Beta SP - DigiBeta. The movie was done in the aspect ratio of 16/9. The production company that made the movie was Supinfocom Valenciennes. The distribution of the short movie was handled by International Premium Films.\nAnimation.\nAnimations for the movie were done by Matthieu Bernadat, Marion Petegnief, Nils Boussuge, Florence Ciuccoli, and Clement Deltour.\nCharacters.\nThe children were each affected by the radioactivity in different ways. Each character was named based on their mutation.\nMusic for the movie.\nMusic for the movie was done by Nikolas Javelle, Yann Philippe, S\u00e9bastien Rouyer Fessard, Nikolas Javelle, and Yann Philippe.\nPlot.\nThe story follows four orphaned children's lives. One of them is a siamese twin. \"In an orphanage somewhere in Ukraine a group of hideously deformed kids are about to visit their mother, the Nuclear Power Plant.\" The story happens after Chernobyl Nuclear Plant explosion.\nReviews.\nThe look and feel of the animation is somewhere between Pixar and a Slipknot music video that\u2019s been burnt on one side and left out in the desert. The result is something that might play in a dank backroom of a short film festival (or out in the open of Fantastic Fest).\nAwards.\nThe movie \"Chernokids\" won the award for Best Digital Film at the Rome International [[Festival]] of Short Films &amp; New Images (Arcipelago) during 2011 in Italy.\nThe movie was also in the running for awards at the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Bilbao (Zinebi) during 2011 in Spain.

The report was published by the Zoological Society of London in 2012 as the book, \"Priceless or Worthless?\" \nThe species are threatened with extinction, and they have no obvious benefit for humans. This was deliberate, to avoid \"vested interests\". Iconic and charismatic species, such as tigers and pandas, and economically important species, have many defenders. These apparently \"worthless\" species had none. The title of the report, \"Priceless or Worthless?\", is based on that shared quality of the species. The report's co-author, Ellen Butcher, stated one of the guiding principles of the list, \"If we take immediate action we can give them a fighting chance for survival. But this requires society to support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent right to exist\".\nScientists are finding they have to justify funding for protection by showing what the human benefits would be. Jonathan Baillie, of the Zoological Society of London, said \"The donor community and conservation movement are increasingly leaning towards a 'what can nature do for us?' approach, where species and wild habitats are valued and prioritised according to these services they provided for people. This has made it increasingly difficult for conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet\".\nSome of the threatened species are down to only a handful of surviving members. Santa Catarina\u2019s guinea pig, native to a single island in Brazil, is down to its last 40\u201360 individuals, reduced by hunting and habitat disturbance. The Great Indian bustard is threatened by habitat loss resulting from agriculture and human development, and is down to the last 50\u2013250 individuals. \"Elaeocarpus bojeri\", a flowering plant found only on the island of Mauritius, has fewer than 10 surviving individuals, because of loss of habitat. The Baishan fir (\"Abies beshanzuensis\"), native to China, is down to five surviving mature individuals. \"Priceless or Worthless?\" describes the threats that each species is facing, and measures that would help their survival."}

Therefore the game can be played by people who know nothing about modern bridge bidding.\nAlthough the rules are simple, there is scope for scientific play. Originally it was a gambling game played in clubs and coffee houses.\nHistory.\nWhist is a descendant of the 16th century game of \"trump\" or \"ruff\". The game takes its name from the 17th century \"whist\" (or \"wist\", or \"whisk\") meaning \"quiet\", \"silent\", \"attentive\", which is the root of the modern \"wistful\".\nWhist is first described by Charles Cotton in his \"The Compleat Gamester\", published in London in 1674. It appears again in Seymour's \"Court Gamester\" of 1719, and we know that whist was played in some coffee houses in London. About 1728, a group led by the first Lord Folkestone played in Crown's coffee house in Bedford Row, London. They began to develop its potential as a partnership game.\nEdmond Hoyle tutored wealthy young gentlemen in the game and published \"A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist\" in 1742. It became the standard text and rules for the game for the next hundred years and helped the game become fashionable. There are over 150 editions of this little book.\nIn the 1890s, a variant known as bridge-whist became popular. It evolved in stages to become auction bridge, and finally contract bridge in the late 1920s.\nThe traditional game of whist is still played at social events called \"whist drives\".\nRules and etiquette.\nThe rules are how it is played; the etiquette is how the players should behave.\nA standard 52-card pack is used. The cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Whist is played by four players, who play in two partnerships with the partners sitting opposite each other. Players cut or draw cards to determine partners, with the two highest playing against the two lowest. The players then cut for deal.\nIt is against the etiquette to comment on the cards in any way. One may not comment upon the hand one was dealt nor about one's good fortune or bad fortune.\nThe play of the cards.\nMany basic ideas in card-play were discovered by whist players, and survive today in contract bridge. An example is the \"finesse\". This is an attempt to win a trick with a card lower than your best. For example: holding AQ73 in the South hand, the partnership lacks the K. North leads a low card, next hand plays low and South plays the Q. If it wins, an extra trick has been made. \nSignalling between partners by means of the card-play was well understood and used. Examples are: leading the top card in a sequence, such as K from KQJx, and also leading 4th highest from any suit (which implies you hold one or two top honours in that suit). In 1834 Lord Henry Bentinck invented the \"high-low\" signal, which encourages partner to continue the suit. Some advanced ideas were known. Alexandre Deschapelles (17801847), a French genius at both cards and chess, invented a play now known as the Deschapelles coup. It is the sacrifice of a high-ranking card to get entry to partner's hand.\nDuplicate whist.\nThe technique of running events where all players sitting in the same direction play the same cards was invented for whist. A duplicate whist drive has placings N/S and placings E/W. Modern movements for contract bridge events are developments of that duplicate whist system.\nThe basic movement was invented by John T. Mitchell, a Scot who moved to the U.S. He invented the boards which hold the cards, and the movement for whist drives, in the 1890s. In the basic Mitchell movement all N/S pairs sit, while E/W pairs move one table up each round. When they move, boards go down one table. The effect of this is to divide the tournament into two halves, but later movements can avoid this. By allowing many pairs to play the same set of boards, tournament whist was invented. The idea, with variations, is still used today for bridge tournaments."}

It has a small range in northeastern Madagascar, where it is known locally as the \"simpona\". It is one of the rarest mammals on Earth, and is listed by the IUCN as one of the world's 25 most endangered primates. The silky sifaka is one of nine species in the genus \"Propithecus\". The species is only found within a few protected areas in the rainforests of northeastern Madagascar, with most of the remaining population in Marojejy National Park and Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve.\nThe silky sifaka has a social structure, and lives in groups of two to nine individuals. It spends most of its day feeding and resting, and spends time to social behaviors like playing, grooming and travelling. Females occasionally take priority over males during feeding. Like other eastern sifakas, it eats mainly leaves and seeds, but also fruit, flowers, and even soil on occasion.\nIt is a seasonal breeder and only mates one day a year during the start of the rainy season. As with other sifaka species, non-maternal infant care is common. Group members of all ages and both sexes will often groom, play, occasionally carry, and even nurse infants that are not their own. The silky sifaka vocalizes frequently, and relies strongly on scent for communication."}

More specifically, the term is used for those who study history with particular attention to ancient artifacts. This includes archaeological and historic sites, or historic archives and manuscripts. The essence of antiquarianism is a focus on the empirical evidence of the past. It may be better explained by the motto adopted by the 18th-century antiquary, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, \"We speak from facts not theory\". \nAntiquarian societies.\nIn the 18th century a new form of humanism emerged. Learned men and those interested in history formed new antiquarian societies. They were not associated with universities. They were formed by gentlemen of means and leisure, They had a growing interest in ancient Greece. A fortunate few, mainly Englishmen and Frenchmen, could visit these sites. A lucky few could even afford books illustrating these antiquities. Many early antiquarians were self-taught. These gentlemen scholars prepared papers on their findings and debated these in the society meetings. At times they disagreed with the new academic approach to history. By the end of the 19th century, antiquarianism had been replaced by a number of more specialized academic disciplines. These included archaeology, art history, numismatics, sigillography, philology, literary studies and diplomatics. Today the term is often used in a pejorative sense. It is used to refer to a very narrow focus on historical trivia instead of the actual history. \nAn antiquarian may also be someone who collect or study antiques."}

The movie was first shown on the Lifetime network on November 29, 2014. \nIt stars Megan Charpentier as a young girl who adopts Grumpy Cat. Then she finds out that she and the cat can really talk with one another. \nThe voice of Grumpy Cat is spoken by the actress Aubrey Plaza. She did not know about Grumpy Cat before working in the movie. To prepare, she learned all about Grumpy's behavior. The movie had already been made when Aubrey did the cat's voice part. Instead of using her script, she made up most of Grumpy's lines that ended up in the movie.\nPlot.\nGrumpy Cat is a lonely cat living in a pet shop in a shopping mall. The pet shop is going to go out of business and be shut down. Grumpy is sad and upset because she is not getting picked to get a new home, while other animals are being adopted. \nChrystal is a lonely 12-year-old girl who comes into the pet store right before Christmas and falls in love with Grumpy Cat. Grumpy finds out that she can communicate by talking with this girl. Chrystal is also amazed to find out that Grumpy Cat can talk. At first, the two do not get along with one another. While visiting in the pet shop during the Christmas holidays, they slowly become friends. \nChrystal really likes Grumpy after they have an exciting adventure. A dog that costs a lot of money is about to be dognapped from the pet shop. Even though Grumpy does not like the dog, she stops the theft of the dog from happening.\nReception.\nReviews for \"Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever\" have been both negative and postive. The \"AV Club\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\" both did not like the movie. \"AV Club\" said it was \"the largest turd in Lifetime's crap crown of original programming.\" \"The Guardian\" and \"St. Louis Post Dispatch\" were a bit more positive in their reviews. The \"St. Louis Post Dispatch\" said that although the film was \"terrible\" they still enjoyed it overall."}

It happened during a violent storm on 28 December 1879. The first Tay Rail Bridge collapsed while a train was passing over it from Wormit to Dundee, killing all aboard.\nFirst rail bridge.\nThe Tay Bridge was designed by noted railway engineer Thomas Bouch, who received a knighthood when the bridge was completed. It was a lattice-grid design, combining cast and wrought iron. The design was well known, having been successfully used in the Crumlin Viaduct in South Wales in 1858. \nAn earlier cast iron design, the Dee bridge which collapsed in 1847, failed due to poor use of cast-iron girders. In 1867 Gustave Eiffel used a similar design to build several large viaducts in the Massif Central.\nPlans to build a bridge across the River Tay date back to at least 1854. The \"North British Railway (Tay Bridge) Act\" received the Royal Assent on 15 July 1870 and the foundation stone was laid on 22 July 1871.\nThe bridge design: the basic idea.\nThe original design was for lattice girders supported by brick piers resting on bedrock. Test drilling showed the rock was not far below the river. At either end of the bridge the single rail track ran on top of the bridge girder, most of which lay below the pier tops. However, in the middle section of the bridge (the \u201chigh girders\u201d) the railway ran inside the bridge girder, which could then run above the pier tops. This made the bridge high enough to allow sailing ships to travel up the river to Perth.\nHowever as the bridge extended out into the river, it became clear in December 1873, that the bedrock really lay much deeper. It was too deep to act as a foundation for the bridge piers. Bouch had to redesign the bridge. He reduced the number of piers and increased the span of the girders. The pier foundations were no longer taken down to bedrock; instead they were built by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed,\nThe work.\nThe company which had the contract for building the bridge went bankrupt while Bouch was redesigning the bridge. The new company did poor work. Almost every part of the bridge was substandard, including the iron and the ties and fixings. Lack of precision in the bolts and braces led to on-site fixes, described by one witness at the later inquiry as \"about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life\".\nOpening.\nThe bridge was opened for passenger traffic on 1 June 1878. The next year, on June 20 1879, Queen Victoria crossed the bridge to return south from Balmoral. Bouch was presented to her before she did so, and on June 26th 1879 he was knighted by the Queen at Windsor Castle.\nThe Tay Bridge Disaster.\nOn the night of 28 December 1879 at 7.15pm, the bridge collapsed after its central spans gave way during high winter gales. A train with six carriages carrying 75 passengers and crew, crossing at the time of the collapse, fell into the icy waters of the Tay. All 75 were killed. The disaster stunned the whole country and sent shock waves through the Victorian engineering community.\nAt the time a gale of about force ten or eleven (Tropical Storm force winds: 55\u201372\u00a0mph/80\u2013117\u00a0km/hr) had been blowing down the Tay estuary at right angles to the bridge. The engine itself was salvaged from the river and repaired for service on the railways.\nThe collapse of the bridge, opened only 19 months earlier and passed as safe by the Board of Trade, is still the most famous bridge disaster in the British Isles. The stumps of the original bridge piers can still be seen above the surface of the Tay even at high tide.\nReport of the Court of Inquiry.\nCauses.\nThe inquiry said that \"\"the fall of the bridge was occasioned by the insufficiency of the cross-bracings and fastenings to sustain the force of the gale on the night of December 28th 1879 and that the bridge had been previously strained by other gales\".\"\nHowever, this is not a finding that the bridge \"as designed\" would have failed. The engineer who carried out a detailed report on the bridge design said: \nThe section in the middle of the bridge, where the rail ran inside high girders, was likely to be top-heavy and very vulnerable to high winds. Neither Bouch nor the builders appeared to have regularly visited the on-site foundry where iron from the earlier half-built bridge was recycled. The cylindrical cast iron columns supporting the 13\u00a0longest spans of the bridge, each 245\u00a0ft (75 m) long, were of poor quality. Many had been cast horizontally, with the result that the walls were not of even thickness. There was some evidence that poor quality work was hidden from the (very inadequate) quality control inspections.\nIn particular, some of the lugs used as attachment points for the wrought iron bracing bars had been \"burnt on\" rather than cast with the columns. Even the normal lugs were very weak. They were tested for the Inquiry, and proved to break at only about rather than the expected load of . These lugs failed and weakened the entire middle of the bridge during the storm.\nPut into simple words, the bridge failed because of defects in its manufacture. This meant it did not reach the standards of wind resistance planned by the designer."}

{"id": "471879", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471879", "title": "Hammond organ", "text": "The Hammond organ is a keyboard instrument that looks like a piano. The most common Hammond organs create sound using metal wheels and electricity. It is an electric version of a pipe organ that was invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert. It was first built in 1935. Sliding \"drawbars\" adjust the type of sound that the organ makes. The Hammond organ is one of the most successful organs made because almost two million Hammond organs were sold.\nFeatures.\nKeyboards and Pedalboard.\nThe most common Hammond organ has two keyboards that are called manuals by organ players. They are smaller versions of piano keyboards that are stacked on top of each other. This allows the organist to play both at the same time. The keys on the manuals of a Hammond organ are lighter and easier to press than the keys on a piano. This makes it easier for organists to play notes faster. \nThe pedalboard on a Hammond organ looks like a very large piano keyboard. It's played with your feet and makes very low sounding notes, known as bass notes. \nBoth manuals and the pedalboard can be played at the same time, making it easy to make complex sounds with the organ.\nDrawbars.\nThe sounds that the manuals and pedalboard make are controlled by switches called drawbars. You can pull them out to make the sound louder, or push them in to make the sound softer. Each manual has nine drawbars that control different parts of the sound. The drawbars on the left side control lower sounds while the drawbars on the right side control higher sounds. The pedalboard has two drawbars, and they both control low sounds.\nPercussion.\nHammond organs have a feature called \"percussion\" which allows you to add melodic clicks to the music you're playing. It's controlled by switches on the upper left side of the organ. Percussion adds harmonics to the melodies you're playing.\nVibrato and Chorus.\nTo further change the sound of the organ, a knob exists that adds vibrato or chorus to the music depending on how it's turned. Vibrato is a very small change in pitch that makes the notes sound like they're \"wobbly\". Chorus adds additional notes to the notes you're playing to make the sound more \"full\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Hammond organ was based off of an early instrument called the Telharmonium which made sounds the same way the Hammond organ did, with turning metal discs. Laurens Hammond, the inventor, had a clock making business where he created a clock motor that is useful for other things too. With his motor he made the Hammond Organ. \nTonewheel organs.\nThe most common Hammond organs are tonewheel organs, which means that they create sound based off of turning metal disks with bumps on the edges. An electric signal is sent over the bumps and the resulting signal is made louder by using an amplifier. Hammond's A, B, C, D, and RT series organs use tonewheels, and according to experts, they are preferred over any other model of Hammond. \nHammond manufactured tonewheel organs from 1935 to 1975.\nTransistor organs.\nAfter Hammond made tonewheel organs, he moved onto transistor organs, which didn't use tonewheels, but instead used computer circuitry to generate sound. Most Hammond organ players did not like the sound of the transistor organs, and they lost popularity quickly. \nHammond manufactured transistor organs from 1975 to 1985 when the Hammond Organ Company went out of business.\nSound.\nTone Generator.\nThe tone generator in a Hammond organ is made up of many tonewheels spinning at the same speed. Electric signals and amplifiers make the sounds louder.\nSpeakers.\nThe most common speaker used with the Hammond organ is called a Leslie speaker. Made by Don Leslie, it copies the sound of a pipe organ by rotating the speakers inside the speaker cabinet. Leslie speakers were not made by Hammond, but most people liked them so much that they would buy them anyway. \nAn alternative to the Leslie Speaker is the Hammond Tone Cabinet, but that wasn't as popular."}

{"id": "471921", "revid": "1130849", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471921", "title": "CamelCase", "text": "CamelCase (camel case, camel caps or medial capitals) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases so that each next word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter. CamelCase can either start with a lowercase or uppercase letter, although the lowerCase version is much more common in programming. Common examples are PowerPoint or iPhone.\nVariations.\nThere are many variations of CamelCase. A few important ones are:\nHistory.\nChemical formulae.\nThe first use of medial capitals was the notation for chemical formulae invented by the Swedish chemist Berzelius in 1813. He did this to replace the large amount of naming and symbol systems used by chemists at that time. He suggested to show each chemical element by a symbol of one or two letters, the first one being capitalized. The capitalization allowed formulae like 'NaCl' to be written without spaces and still be read without confusion. This system is still in use today.\nEarly use in trademarks.\nSince the early 20th century, medial capitals have occasionally been used for corporate names and product trademarks, such as\nSpread to mainstream usage.\nDespite its unclear origins inside the computing world, the practice spread in the 1980s and 1990s, when the personal computer became popular and exposed hacker culture to the world. CamelCase then became popular for business names. By 1990, it was very common to see CamelCase used in this way:\nDuring the late 1990s when the internet became far more popular and easily available, the lowercase prefixes \"e\" (for \"electronic\") and \"i\" (for \"Internet\", \"information\", \"interactive\", \"intelligent\", etc.) became quite common, and we began to see names like Apple's iMac and the eBox computer program.\nHistory of the name \"CamelCase\".\nThe original name of the practice, used in media studies, grammars and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", was \"medial capitals\". The fancier names such as \"InterCaps\", \"CamelCase\" and other variations are pretty recent and seem more common in computer-related communities.\nThe earliest known occurrence of the term \"InterCaps\" on Usenet is in an April 1990 post to the group alt.folklore.computers by Avi Rappoport, with \"BiCapitalization\" appearing slightly later in a 1991 post by Eric S. Raymond to the same group. The earliest use of the name \"CamelCase\" occurs in 1995, in a post by Newton Love. \"\"With the advent of programming languages having these sorts of constructs, the humpiness of the style made me call it HumpyCase at first, before I settled on CamelCase. I had been calling it CamelCase for years,\" said Love, \"The citation above was just the first time I had used the name on USENET.\"\"\nCurrent usage in computing.\nProgramming and coding.\nThe use of medial caps for identifiers is recommended by many organizations and software projects. For some languages (such as Mesa, Pascal, Modula, Java and Microsoft's .NET) CamelCase is recommended by the language developers or by important manuals and has therefore become part of the language's \"culture\".\nStyle guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower CamelCase. They usually specify which one should be used for certain kinds of things: variables, record fields, methods, procedures, types, etc. This is sometimes supported by static analysis tools that check source code to make sure it is following these guidelines.\nWiki link markup.\nCamelCase is used in some wiki markup languages for terms that should be automatically linked to other wiki pages. This convention was originally used in Ward Cunningham's original wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, and can be activated in most other wikis. Some wiki engines such as TiddlyWiki, Trac and PMWiki use it in the default settings. They also usually provide an option or plugin to disable it. Wikipedia used to use CamelCase linking. However, they have switched to explicit link markup using square brackets and many other wiki sites have done the same. Some wikis that do not use CamelCase linking may still use the CamelCase as a naming convention, such as AboutUs.\nOther uses.\nThe NIEM registry requires that XML data elements use upper CamelCase and XML attributes use lower CamelCase.\nMost popular command-line interfaces and scripting languages usually can't handle file names that contain embedded spaces. Because of this, users of those systems often use to CamelCase (or underscores, hyphens and other \"safe\" characters) for compound file names like MyJobResume.pdf.\nMicroblogging and social networking sites that limit the number of characters in a message (most famously Twitter, where the 140-character limit can be quite restrictive in languages that rely on alphabets, including English) are usually outlets for medial capitals. Using CamelCase between words reduces the number of spaces, and thus the number of characters in a given message. This allows more content to fit into the limited space.\nCurrent usage in natural languages.\nCamelCase has been used in languages other than English for several purposes. Some examples are:\nOrthographic markings.\nCamelCase is sometimes used in the writing or translation of certain scripts as a way to tell the difference between ceratin letters or markings. An example is the rendering of Tibetan proper names like \"rLobsang\": the \"r\" here stands for a prefix glyph in the original script that functions as tone marker rather than a normal letter. Another example is \"tsIurku\", a Latin transcription of the Chechen term for the capping stone of the characteristic Medieval defensive towers of Chechenia and Ingushetia; the capital letter \"I\" here showing a phoneme different from the one transcribed as \"i\".\nInflection prefixes.\nCamelCase may also be used when writing proper names in languages that add prefixes to words. In some of those languages, the custom is to leave the prefix in lower case and capitalize the root.\nThis convention is used in Irish orthography e.g., (\"in Galway\"), from (\"Galway\"); (\"to Ireland\"), from (\"Ireland).\nSimilarly, when translating the Hebrew language, \"haIvri\" means \"the Hebrew person\" and \"biYerushalayim\" means \"in Jerusalem\".\nThis convention is also used by several Bantu languages (e.g., \"kiSwahili\" = \"Swahili language\", \"isiZulu\" = \"Zulu language\") and several indigenous languages of Mexico (e.g. Nahuatl, Totonacan, Mixe\u2013Zoque and some Oto-Manguean languages).\nIn abbreviations and acronyms.\nAbbreviations of some academic qualifications are sometimes presented in CamelCase without punctuation, e.g. PhD or BSc.\nIn French, CamelCase acronyms such as OuLiPo (1960) were favored for a time as alternatives to initialisms (or representing compound words only by the first letter of each word).\nCamelCase is often used to transliterate initialisms into alphabets where two letters may be required to represent a single character of the original alphabet, e.g., DShK from Cyrillic \u0414\u0428\u041a and PPSh from Cyrillic \u041f\u041f\u0428. \nIn Chinese pinyin, CamelCase is sometimes used for place names so that it is easier for readers to pick out the different parts of the word. For example, places like Beijing (\u5317\u4eac) and Qinhuangdao (\u79e6\u7687\u5c9b) and Daxing'anling (\u5927\u5174\u5b89\u5cad) can be written as \"BeiJing,\" \"QinHuangDao,\" and \"DaXingAnLing,\" with the number of capital letters being the same as the number of Chinese characters for each word. Writing word compounds only by the initial letter of each character is also acceptable in some cases, so Beijing can be written as \"BJ,\" Qinghuangdao as \"QHD,\" and Daxing'anling as \"DXAL\". \nHonorifics within compound words.\nIn several languages, including English, pronouns and possessives may be capitalized to show respect. For example: when referring to the reader of a formal letter or to God. In some of those languages, the capitalization is retained even when those words occur within compound words or suffixed to a verb. For example, in Italian one would write (\"offering to You respectful salutations\") or (\"adore Him\").\nOther uses.\nIn German nouns carry a grammatical gender\u2014which, for roles or job titles, is felt usually as masculine. Since the feminist movement of the 1980s, some writers and publishers have been using the feminine title suffixes \"-in\" (singular) and \"-innen\" (plural) to help boost the inclusion of women; but written with a capital 'I', to indicate that males are not excluded. Example: (\"co-workers, male or female\") instead of (\"co-workers\", masculine grammatical gender) or (\"female co-workers\"). This use is analogous to the use of parentheses in English, for example in the phrase \"congress(wo)man.\"\nIn German, the names to statutes are shortened using embedded capitals. An example would be: StGB (Strafgesetzbuch) for criminal code, PatG (Patentgesetz) for Patent Act or the very common GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung) for Company with Limited Liability."}

But unlike his father he lacked tact. \nHe faced a number of rebellions. The Mewar ruler Rana Sangram Singh extended his empire right up to western Uttar Pradesh and threatened to attack Agra. There was rebellion in the East also. Ibrahim Lodi also displeased the nobility when he replaced old and senior commanders by younger ones who were loyal to him. He further alienated them by throwing some of the older noblemen in prison. His Afghan nobility eventually invited Babur to invade India. In 1526, the Mughal forces of Babur, the king of Kabulistan, defeated Ibrahim's much larger army in the 1st Battle of Panipat. Ibrahim was killed during the battle. It is estimated that Babur's forces numbered around 12,000 men. His army had between 20 to 24 pieces of field artillery. Ibrahim Lodi had around 30,000-40,000 men along with at least 100 war elephants. After Ibrahim Lodi was overthrown, the mughals invaded India."}

Regression toward the mean was first described by Francis Galton. He found that offspring of tall parents tended to be shorter. Also, offspring of shorter parents tended to be taller. Galton stated that processes that did not follow regression towards the mean would quickly go out of control.\nHistory.\nIn 1886, Galton published a paper called \"Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature\". In the paper, he observed that extreme characteristics (e.g., height) in parents are not passed on completely to their offspring. Rather, the characteristics in the offspring \"regress\" towards a \"mediocre\" point. Today, this point is called the mean. By measuring the heights of hundreds of people, he was able to quantify regression to the mean, and estimate the size of the effect. Galton wrote that, \u201cthe average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective mid-parental deviations\u201d. This means that the difference between a child and its parents for some characteristic is proportional to its parents' deviation from typical people in the population. If its parents are each two inches taller than the averages for men and women, on average, the child will be shorter than its parents by some factor times two inches. Today, this factor has been calculated to be one minus the regression coefficient. For height, Galton estimated this coefficient to be about two thirds: the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents\u2019 deviation from the population average.\nObservation.\nGalton used the term regression to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits: namely that the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution will tend to lie closer to the centre, the mean, of the distribution. He quantified this trend, and in doing so invented linear regression analysis. This is the starting point for much of modern statistical modelling. Since then, the term \"regression\" has taken on different meanings, and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena of sampling bias which have little to do with Galton's original observations in the field of genetics.\nGalton's explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed is now known to be incorrect. He stated: \u201cA child inherits partly from his parents, partly from his ancestors. Speaking generally, the further his genealogy goes back, the more numerous and varied will his ancestry become, until they cease to differ from any equally numerous sample taken at haphazard from the race at large.\u201d This is incorrect, since a child receives its genetic makeup exclusively from its parents. There is no generation-skipping in genetic material: any genetic material from earlier ancestors than the parents must have passed through the parents. The phenomenon is better understood if we assume that the inherited trait (e.g., height) is controlled by a large number of recessive genes. Exceptionally tall individuals must be homozygous for increased height mutations on a large proportion of these loci. But the loci which carry these mutations are not necessarily shared between two tall individuals, and if these individuals mate, their offspring will be on average homozygous for \"tall\" mutations on fewer loci than either of their parents. In addition, height is not entirely genetically determined, but also subject to environmental influences during development, which make offspring of exceptional parents even more likely to be closer to the average than their parents.\nIn sharp contrast to this population genetic phenomenon of regression to the mean, which is best thought of as a combination of a binomially distributed process of inheritance (plus normally distributed environmental influences), the term \"regression to the mean\" is now often used to describe completely different phenomena in which an initial sampling bias may disappear as new, repeated, or larger samples display sample means that are closer to the true underlying population mean."}

For doing this, Hypervisor needs to monitor the paging activities of guest OS and intercept it with necessarily inserting, deleting or modifying entries in this second page table. This consumes processor's time and system physical memory space. Nested Paging provides a Second Level Address Translation. With help of it, Hypervisor does not need to maintain that second page table with intercepting activities on guest paging. It simply maintains the nested page table for translating the guest physical address into the system physical address. After nested page table created, the paging hardware does the translation job automatically. Each guest physical access would incur nested paging, for a 48-bit address paging in 4KiB, a guest physical address translation would need 25 accesses of system physical memory. So larger TLB and page size would decrease the system physical memory accesses. \nProcessors.\nAMD RVI:\nAMD 10h and later\nIntel EPT: \nIntel Nehalem and later"}

Today this is usually by rail or road transport. \nRoads.\nEarly civilizations utilized human power to move goods. The ancient Greeks preferred to travel and move goods by sea. But they did have a respectable road system to move heavy loads by cart. The Romans built all-weather roads throughout the Roman Empire. They were an improvement over Etruscan roads. They were to allow the rapid movement of troops and military supplies. It was also important for trade and the transport of goods. Roman roads were well drained, relatively smooth and straight wherever possible. The Romans built bridges to cross water and causeways to cross marshes. They were well built but needed constant maintenance.\nBy the 16th century roads were used by coaches (public transport) and heavy wagons. Wagon building became an important business. Special horses were bred to pull the heavy loads. For longer distances, teams of horses were changed several times as they became tired. Inns sprang up in countries like England to take care of travelers. But the heavy traffic of large wagons and coaches were making roads difficult to maintain. \nIn the 20th century motor cars and trucks became the main traffic of roads. A new kind of Controlled-access highway was invented for them. \nRail systems.\nThe early 18th century saw the use of plateways, trams and horse drawn rail cars. In the 19th century the steam engine in locomotives moved entire trains of rail cars. Rail transport across countries and continents became relatively cheap."}

Within this physical description two different antenna designs are common: the small loop (or \"magnetic loop\") with a size much smaller than a wavelength, and the resonant loop antenna with a circumference approximately equal to the wavelength.\nSmall loops have a poor efficiency and are mainly used as receiving antennas at low frequencies. Except for car radios, almost every AM broadcast receiver sold has such an antenna built in or directly attached to it. These antennas are also used for radio direction finding. In amateur radio, loop antennas can be used where larger antennas would be inconvenient, unsightly, or banned because of size. Loop antennas are relatively easy to build.\nA small loop antenna, also known as a magnetic loop, generally has a circumference of less than one tenth of a wavelength, in which case there will be a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor. As the frequency or the size is increased, a standing wave starts to develop in the current, and the antenna starts to acquire some of the characteristics of a resonant loop (but is not resonant); for this reason, these intermediate cases cannot be analyzed using the concepts developed for the small and resonant loop antennas described below. \nResonant loop antennas are relatively large, governed by the intended wavelength of operation. Thus they are typically used at higher frequencies, especially VHF and UHF, where their size is manageable. They can be viewed as a folded dipole deformed into a different shape, and have rather similar characteristics such as a high radiation efficiency."}

Despite this, over one million people starved in Ireland, between 1846 and 1849. This famine is known as Irish Potato Famine today. \nEconomists, such as David Ricardo were against the Corn Laws. Ricardo believed that overall, protectionism made corn too expensive for the economy as a whole. He also believed that with the laws, the protection of agriculture was too big. He wrote about these ideas in his work called \"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation \"from 1817\". \"Thomas Malthus was in favor of the laws; in his opinion, they helped the agriculture of the country, and would not lead to the country depending on others.

This has been practiced as long as there have been cities. Other names include \"pea-patching\", victory gardening and foodscaping.\nCity \"farms\".\nFood is grown in a city setting for the use of an individual or family as well as for the community. This is not the same as the back-to-the-land movements of the 1970s. It is mainly about the little family farm inside the city. Land use in cities is subject to local land laws. Where permitted city farms may be anything from small window boxes to shared community gardens. Urban farmers can grow food for their own use. They can also sell excess crops directly to stores or at a farmers' market. City farms can also be nonprofit operations that grow food for poor and homeless people. \nMany city farms grow organic foods. These are from plants that do not use chemical fertilizers or pesticides. City farming also includes food growing cooperatives. They provide the opportunity to get involved in agriculture in their own city. In Brisbane, Australia a community group took a city park that flooded regularly and changed it to an organic city farm. Called Northey Street City Farm, people of all ages and backgrounds work together to grow food. Fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers are grown. Ponds were introduced to attract beneficial insects, frogs and birds which help in pest control.\nEconomics.\nCity farming allows people to save money growing and harvesting their own food. It allows many individuals and families to make an income selling the food they grow. It helps the cities by recycling organic waste into compost and soil. It takes vacant lots and turns them into green spaces.\nCommunity.\nShared garden space or community gardens provide a sense of working together. People, especially children, learn stewardship (planning and managing resources). Kids learn responsiblity and work ethics. They are also eager to try new foods when they see them grown in their own gardens. In some countries, gardens are grown on rooftops or on pavement. In some places land around public schools is made available for gardens. This benefits the school by providing food for school lunches. It also allows children to learn about growing their own food.\nVictory gardens.\nVictory gardens were city farms that sprang up during World War I and World War II. There were food shortages in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Germany. In the US alone, victory gardens provided 40% of the produce used during World War II. In addition to farms, gardens were grown in window boxes, rooftops, back yards and vacant yards. Victory gardens gave the people at home a sense of doing their part for the war effort. Women in England tended to grow ornamental gardens. This made for an easy shift towards food gardening. Women in the US had a cultural identity with the British and also grew ornamental gardens. But there were stereotypes to working in agricultural jobs in the US. But these were quickly overcome. Victory gardens were not uncommon even among upper classes in America."}

It's one of the most popular comics in Spain.\nIts first title was \"Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n: Agencia de Informaci\u00f3n\". It was just the main characters. Every comics strip had from one to four pages. Throughout the years, the characters have evolved. At first, Mortadelo used to wear a bowler hat. He used to wear some disguises. He was known for his shapeshifter abilities. However Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez went to leave the hat on therefore Mortadelo get disguise inmmediately. The other one, Filem\u00f3n, called by Mortadelo as \"Jefe\" (\"Chief\" or \"Boss\" in English) had a beaked nose and use to smoke pipe as Sherlock Holmes used to do.\nTheir names are wordplay. For example: Mortadelo comes from \"Mortadela\" (\"Mortadella di Bologna\") and Filem\u00f3n from \"Filete\" (\"Steak\").\nIn 1969, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez designed more characters. He also \"founded\" the TIA. The \"T\u00e9cnicos de Investigaci\u00f3n Aeroterr\u00e1quea\": \"Aeroterrestrial Investigation Technicians\") is an organisation that is a spoof on the CIA. With those changes, the comics books were much longer (44-48 pages by comic book).\nThese editions were more satirical in regard to Spanish and international themes such as politics and political corruption (\"El atasco de influencias\"), ETA's terrorism (\"Barcelona '92\") where the terrorist group were named as \"TETA\" (\"TITS\"), and \"PEPA\" in \"Espa\u00f1a '82\", and the islamic one (\"Terroristas\" or \"El bal\u00f3n catastr\u00f3fico\") or economics (\"\u00a1Lleg\u00f3 el Euro!\") among others.\nBackground.\nAt first the characters were portrayed as a parody version of Arthur Conan Doyle's characters: Sherlock Holmes (Filem\u00f3n) and Dr. Watson (Mortadelo).\n Later, others sources pointed to \"Nov\u00edsimas aventuras de Sherlock Holmes\" by Enrique Jardiel Poncela or Laurel and Hardy. The comics books are known for its slapstick comedy. It is not unusual to see the characters being injuried or hurt. They have caused several accidents. For example, falling from a fifth floor window and staying alive.\n35th Anniversary.\nIs often enough to see own Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez breaking the fourth wall when he's designed by himself. In 1992 was the 35th \"Mort and Phil\"'s anniversary, so he made an special edition tittled \"El 35 aniversario\". In it, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez explained how was his childhood and his career went when began to work in Ediciones Bruguera (nowadays: Ediciones B), Barcelona, Spain. He explained it with a burlesque point of view. He also told how Mortadelo and Filem\u00f3n met each other.\nThat edition had a huge success among its fans. It was not until 2001, a few days after the September 11 terrorist attacks that the last page (and vignette) called the readers attention to the tragedy. It was noted also in television media, because in the vignette's background (a common gag made by Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez in all his works) there was a plane that crashed into the World Trade Center, in New York, in the United States.\nSince its official website stated \"that scene was designed as it and it wasn't retouched\". Regarding the attacks: \"it was a tragical coincidence\"."}

Many colors are unique to certain periods of history. Small bubbles in the glass help to identify the original glass item.\nLocating.\nCollectors walk beaches to find sea glass. After plastic became popular for containers it became harder to find sea glass. Sea glass can take from 7 to 10 years to get a frosted appearance. In many places winter seems to be the best time to find sea glass. Experienced sea glass hunters look for periods of low tide to start looking. Beaches that are cleaned of debris regularly won't produce much sea glass. Hunters look for \"dirty beaches\" that are left alone and have litter."}

They are both considered bat-and-ball games and are played by both men and women. But they also have many differences. They have different rules, terms and organization. Their histories are both similar yet different.\nCommon history?\nBaseball is often thought to have descended from cricket. They both can be traced back to England. They have common terms such as innings, umpires, runs and outs. So the connection seems very logical. Even some baseball historians think cricket is the ancestor of baseball. Both games do have a link, but it is not a parent-child link. It is more on the order of cousins.\nBoth seem to have been brought to England by people from Flanders, but who settled in different parts of England. There each game developed separately. Cricket came from the southeast of England while baseball was played in western England. Baseball started as a children's game while Cricket was more often played by adults. Both games came to America with English immigrants. By the 1840s cricket had a following along the East Coast, particularly in Philadelphia and New York. About the same time Baseball began being organized into clubs. Up until the American Civil War cricket was more popular. After that war baseball became widely popular. Cricket is still played in places like Philadelphia. \nSimilarities.\nBoth are bat and ball games. Both have batsman and bowlers, called batters and pitchers in baseball. Bowlers or pitchers throw the ball to the batsman or batter who hits the ball. Players in the field try to catch the ball. Both games at times use two umpires. Both games involve batters who run between or around things (such as each batsman's ground) to score runs (points), while the fielding team tries to get the ball to those things (bases), or things within the things (wickets), or fielders near them, to stop runs from being scored. Batters can hit the ball out of the field to score runs (home run or six runs). After enough batters are out, both teams change roles, and after enough opportunities for both teams to bat, the team with more runs wins.\nDifferences.\nThe bat in cricket is flat while the bat in baseball is round. Cricket has eleven players while baseball has nine. Cricket players hold the bat down, baseball players hold the bat up. The playing fields are different sizes and shapes. The balls, while similar in construction, are slightly different in weight. The leather cover in baseball is white while cricket balls can have a red or white leather cover.\nIn cricket, when a batter is out, they can't bat again for the rest of their team's inning (turn to bat)."}

Note also, that the term is unrelated to diplomacy. \nThe discipline originally evolved as a tool for studying and determining the authenticity of the official charters and diplomas issued by royal and papal chanceries. It was later found that many of the same underlying principles could be applied to other types of official document and legal instrument, to non-official documents such as private letters, and, most recently, to the metadata of electronic records.\nDiplomatics is one of the auxiliary sciences of history. It should not be confused (as it often is) with its sister-discipline of palaeography.

There are a few theories about how much energy there is in that space. There is the theory that there is an incredibly small, very near-zero amount, the theory that there is zero energy there, the theory that the amount of energy is indeterminable, and the theory that a cubic centimetre of vacuum has a few levels of magnitude more energy than would be required to create the Big Bang.\nIf you look at the way physics is going, there are atoms, then there are subatomic particles making up atoms (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons), then further subatomic particles making up those subatomic particles (e.g. quarks, gluons), and now there is string theory. String theory says that those smallest subatomic particles are made of vibrating strings of energy, and that those strings have practically no actual width whatsoever. So all the matter of the universe could be compressed into an extremely small space, hence the Big Bang theory. If this is the case, the large energy interpretation of zero-point energy seems likely.\nThe term \"zero-point\" comes from the cooling of helium to 0 kelvin. Even at fractions below 1 Kelvin, the helium stays fluid with no signs of freezing."}

It is the second installment of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" series and was followed by \"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer\" in 2006.\nPlot.\nOne year after the events of the first movie, Julie James and George Bronson are attending summer classes in Boston, to avoid returning to their hometown of Southport, North Carolina. She suffers from memories and nightmares of the accident and brutal murders of her friends by the vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis, from the summer before.\nJulie and George's roommate Karla Wilson receives a phone call from a local radio station, and wins an all-expenses-paid vacation to the Bahamas for the Fourth of July weekend. Julie invites her boyfriend and George's brother, Ray Bronson. He declines, but later changes his mind and plans to show up as a surprise and propose.\nThat evening, Ray and his co-worker Dave drive to Boston to meet Julie and George. They stop due to a BMW and body in the middle of the road. Ray discovers that the body is a mannequin dressed in fisherman's clothing. Suddenly, Ben Willis appears and kills Dave with his hook. Ben takes Ray's truck and chases him down the road. Ray gets away, but he is injured from falling down a hill.\nThe next morning, Julie, George and Karla depart on the trip with Karla's boyfriend Tyrell and their friend, Will Benson and Marlene Kennedy. The group arrives at the hotel in Tower Bay, only to find that other guests are leaving due to the imminent hurricane season. To her surprise, Julie is sharing a hotel room with Will and George is sharing a hotel room with Marlene. That evening at the hotel's bar, Julie is talked into singing karaoke. She stops when the words \u201cI STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER\u201d roll onto the screen. Terrified, she runs back to her room and is met by Will, who laid out flowers and a love note for her. Julie sidesteps Will's affection for her, while Tyrell and Karla (and later Will) get into the hot tub.\nJulie notices that her toothbrush is missing. She, Marlene and George search the room and finds the dockhand Darik hanging dead in the closet. They find Tyrell, Karla, and Will, but when they return there is no sign of Darick's body. The hotel manager refuses to believe their story and Julie and George try to call the police, but the phone lines are dead due to the incoming hurricane. Ben arrives at the hotel and kills the employees.\nThe following day, the group finds that the hotel staff and the manager have been murdered, and the two-way radio, their only way of contact, has been destroyed. Isolated, Julie and George tell the others about the previous summer. Tyrell suspects that Estes, the boat hand porter, is the killer, since he is the only one who cannot be found. The group goes to Estes\u2019 apartment, searching for clues. They find Julie's toothbrush and Karla's hair tie, concluding Estes has been using voodoo to protect them. Estes appears and leads them to a graveyard in the forest with the graves of Ben's wife and daughter, and two empty graves and tombstones with Julie and George's names. Estes explains that Ben and his wife Sarah had two children: son Will and daughter Susie. Ben murdered Sarah in the hotel room that Julie is staying in when he found out about her affair and her plans to leave him with their children.\nEstes goes missing, and Will volunteers to find him. Julie, George, Marlene, Karla, and Tyrell return to the hotel and gather supplies to defend themselves. They head to the hotel kitchen for something to eat, and find Nancy, the bartender, hiding in the freezer. Will finds Estes, but he attacks Will while Ray takes a boat to the island. Ben appears and stabs Tyrell in the throat with his hook, killing him. The girls retreat to the attic, where Karla is attacked by Ben. They both fall through to the hotel bedroom below. Karla runs from the room and jumps onto the greenhouse. Julie, George, Marlene and Nancy rescue Karla and run to the storm cellar to take refuge. They find that the storm cellar stores Ben's victims. Will bursts in and convinces the girls to head back to the hotel, stating that he saw Ben on the beach.\nBack at the hotel, Julie and George see Will is bleeding from his stomach, so Nancy takes Karla to find a first aid kit. Nancy and Karla find Estes has been impaled with a harpoon. Ben appears and kills Nancy. Back in the lobby, Julie and George are tending to Will, unable to find a wound. Will admits this is because it is not his blood. He asks Julie what her favorite radio station is, revealing he was the radio host and killed Estes. Will drags Julie, Marlene and George to the graveyard, and tells her he is Ben's son. Ben appears and attacks Julie, Marlene and George. Ray arrives, and a fight ensues between him and Will. When Ben tries to stab Ray, he accidentally kills Will instead, after George saved Ray for getting stabbed. While Ben is distraught from killing his son, Julie and George take two guns and shoot him in the chest. Ben falls dead into the grave made for Julie, Marlene and George. Back at the hotel, Karla is found alive. The five are rescued by the coast guard.\nSometime later, Ray and Julie have married and are in their new home. Ray is brushing his teeth before bed and Julie is in their bedroom. The bathroom door is quietly shut and locked while Ray is occupied. Julie sits down on her bed, looks in the mirror, and sees Ben under the bed. She screams as Ben grabs her feet with his hook and hand and pulls her under leaving her fate unknown."}

Ireland, a former Commonwealth of Nations member, is in the Anglosphere. \nThe term was invented at the end of the 20th century.\nOther meanings.\nThe word means more than just those countries where English is a first or second language. To be considered part of the Anglosphere requires sharing basic customs and values. \"Nations comprising the Anglosphere share a common historical narrative in which the Magna Carta, the English and American Bills of Rights, and such Common law principles as trial by jury, presumption of innocence\". Since the Great Rapprochement of the early 20th century, the United States and Great Britain were far more friendly than before. Their military alliance during World War II has lasted ever since. \nBy the time of the 2003 Iraq war the political use of the word meant the cultural tendency towards military intervention, particularly by the US, the UK and Australia. Strategically, the word has come to mean that the US is usually backed by Britain and Australia, but not so much by Canada. In this sense, Canada is and sometimes is not considered a part of the Anglosphere. This has been since the Pierre Trudeau era. The United States of America is generally considered by many to be the dominant country in the Anglosphere.\nSome go so far as to call it an Anglospherist school of thought. This holds that English speaking countries are becoming a separate civilization in their own right. Anglosphere theorists point out that there is no intent to build an Anglosphere superstate like the European Union. The term was coined (used for the first time) by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson. He used it in his novel \"The Diamond Age\"."}

Often they are on a trade expedition. Caravans were used mainly in desert areas and throughout the Silk Road. Traveling in groups aided in defense against bandits, in the same way that convoys at sea helped protect against piracy. It also helped improve economies of scale in trade. In the 14th century there were reports of caravans of up to 12,000 camels.\nIn historical times, caravans traveled across East Asia and Europe. They often carried luxurious and lucrative goods, such as silks or jewelry. They would trade these for salt, gold, copper or slaves. At first donkey carts were used. They were replaced with the single hump camel. The camel could go great distances on very little water. \nCaravans could require a large investment in goods and camels. They were a rich target for bandits. The profits from a successful trade journey could be great. Many rulers along important trade routes created caravanserai (way stations). These were places where caravans could refresh their animals and supplies can be replenished. However, the volume a caravan could transport was limited. For example, a caravan of 500 camels could only transport as much as a third or half of the goods carried by a regular Byzantine merchant sailing ship.\nPresent-day caravans still transport important goods in less-developed areas of the world. Examples are the camel trains traversing the southern edges of the Sahara Desert. Also, modern caravans are often made up of cars, trucks and busses."}

Others use them as an accessory. Walking sticks come in many shapes and sizes, and can be sought by collectors. Some kinds of walking stick may be used by people with disabilities as a crutch or cane. The walking stick has also historically been known to be used as a defensive or offensive weapon, and may conceal a knife or sword as in a swordstick. The \"tippling cane\" contained a flask usually to hold a small amount of liquor. The Quarterstaff and the Shillelagh are also walking sticks.\nMedieval quarterstaff.\nA quarterstaff was a traditional European walking stick/weapon used from the middle age to the Early Modern period. It was usually a \nshaft of hardwood from long. It was used the same as a walking stick but also as a weapon. It was later called a \"short staff\" as it became shorter. The term is best known from the legends of Robin Hood. In many versions of the story, he fights variously a monk, Little John or others with a quarterstaff. In most versions Robin Hood loses and ends up in the stream.\nFashion accessory.\nFrom about 1550 until 1930, walking sticks were a fashion accessory. They were not much used for walking but were more worn. A proper lady or gentleman would never be without their walking stick or cane. Many were elegant canes with highly decorated handles. Sometime during the 17th century, the decorated walking stick replaced the sword carried by aristocrats as a status symbol. \nHiking.\nWalking sticks, sometimes called a hiking stick or trekking pole, are used by hikers. They are used for support when going uphill or downhill. A good walking stick or pole helps hikers keep their balance while crossing streams or rocks. Modern hiking poles are made of aluminum (or composite materials). They can telescope to fit tall or short hikers. Many have shock absorbers to ease back, shoulder and knee strain.\nSelf defense.\nShillelagh.\nA shillelagh is a wooden walking stick and club or cudgel, typically a thick knotty stick with a large knob at the top. Many are made from oak or willow. Some are made from the blackthorn bush. In the British Army, blackthorn sticks are carried by commissioned officers of the Royal Irish Regiment. The Shillelagh is associated with Ireland and Irish folklore.\nMartial arts.\nThe walking stick is a weapon in martial arts. Both stick training and \"shinai\" (sword) training use the walking stick. Some are light but shinai-weight and heavier are more common. It can be less lethal than a sword but is deadly against a knife or similar weapons. With practice a walking stick user can deliver a \"kote-man\" or double-strike. Once to the wrist (holding the knife) followed instantly by a second blow to the assailant's head. The walking stick has the added advantage it does not look like a weapon. It looks fairly harmless.\nSwordsticks and sword-canes.\nA sword cane was a long thin steel blade encased in a sheath. The sheath was the cane or, in the case of a swordstick, a walking stick. Andrew Jackson carried a sword-cane and was known to have used it. In many modern jurisdictions the ownership, carrying, manufacturing or trading in sword canes is restricted by law. In some places they are considered a concealed weapon.\nCollectors.\nA collector of walking sticks is termed a rabologist."}

{"id": "473700", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=473700", "title": "Fourth wall", "text": "The fourth wall is the imaginary \"wall\" at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled theatre. In a theatre, the fourth wall is the one through which the audience sees the action of the play. The idea of the fourth wall was made famous by philosopher and critic Denis Diderot. It was used more in the 19th century. The fourth wall extended the idea of an imaginary boundary between any fictional work and its audience.\nIf an actor speaks directly to the audience, does something to the audience, or even simply notices the audience, it is known as \"breaking the fourth wall\". In a movie, or on television, this can be done by the actor speaking directly to the camera. This breaks a boundary normally set up or assumed by works of fiction. It is known as a metafictional technique. In literature and video games, it happens when a character acknowledges the reader or player.\nThe fourth wall is not the same as a soliloquy. A soliloquy is a dramatic device used by playwrights where the character on stage gives a monologue which gives the audience insight into their thoughts.\nThe acceptance of the transparency of the fourth wall is part of the suspension of disbelief between a fictional work and an audience. It allows them to enjoy the fiction as if they were observing real events. Although the critic Vincent Canby described it in 1987 as \"that invisible scrim that forever separates the audience from the stage\".\nOutside theatre.\nThe metaphor of the fourth wall has been used by the actor Sir Ian McKellen to describe the work of the painter L. S. Lowry:\n\"... stood across the road from his subjects and observed. Often enough there are a number of individuals in a crowd peering back at him. They invite us momentarily into their world, like characters on a stage sometimes do, breaking the fourth-wall illusion.\"\nMcKellen said that \"Lowry\u2019s mid-air viewpoint is like a view from the dress circle\", looking down as if to a stage. And, McKellen argues, Lowry \"often marks the limits of the street scene with curbstones or a pavement that feel like the edge of the stage where the footlights illuminate the action.\"\nThe metaphor of the fourth wall has been used by literary critic David Barnett to \"The Harvard Lampoon\"'s parody of \"The Lord of the Rings\". He says a character breaks the rules of storytelling by referring to the text itself. The character Frodo observes \"it was going to be a long epic\", which in Barnett's view \"breaks the fourth wall.\nWoody Allen broke the fourth wall several times in his movie \"Annie Hall\". Allen explained, \"because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.\"\n\"Akira Kurosawa\" also broke the fourth wall at the end of his neorealistic drama \"One Wonderful Sunday\".\nFourth wall breaks are also used for comedic effect. Mel Brooks breaks the fourth wall in many of his movies, sometimes literally. In \"Blazing Saddles\", the climactic fight scene between the townspeople and the outlaws was so big that it literally breaks into other parts of the movie studio.\nOn television, breaking the fourth wall is rare. It has been done throughout the history of the medium. George Burns did it many times on the 1950s sitcom he starred in with his real-life wife Gracie Allen. \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" and \"Mrs Brown's Boys\" both have their title character walking between sets mid-scene. The latter shows characters re-doing the same scenes over when they missed a line of the dialogue. Another television character who regularly breaks the fourth wall is Francis Urquhart in the British TV drama series \"House of Cards\", \"To Play the King\" and \"The Final Cut\". Urquhart talks to the audience several times during each episode. He gives the viewer comments on his own actions on the show. The same technique is also used in the American adaptation of \"House of Cards\"."}
