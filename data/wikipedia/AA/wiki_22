He reigned from 1483 until 1485, as the last king from the House of Plantagenet.\nRichard was part of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses. He was the younger brother of King Edward IV. When Edward IV died, his 12-year-old son became King Edward V. Richard was given the role of \"Protector\", meaning he would run the country until Edward V became an adult. But Richard III took the throne for himself. Soon after, Edward V and his younger brother disappeared while living in the Tower of London.\nMany people started saying that Richard had ordered for the boys to be killed. Historians are not sure about this. Many of the House of York's supporters believed he had done it, and turned against him. He managed to put down a rebellion by his old friend the Duke of Buckingham, but faced another rebellion by Henry Tudor. This led to the Battle of Bosworth Field, in which Richard was killed and his army was lost. His body was buried quickly in a church in Leicester. In 2012, the body was rediscovered beneath a car park. It was reburied in Leicester Cathedral in 2015.\nFor many years, Richard III was seen as a villain. The Tudor kings and queens encouraged this, as did Shakespeare's famous play \"Richard III\". Almost all writers at the time saw him as either a hero or a villain. In both the past and the present, some writers say that Richard III made many good laws despite being ruthless. Others argue that his ruthless behaviour was common for the powerful people of that time.\nEarly life.\nRichard was the youngest son of Richard, Duke of York. He had three elder brothers, Edward, Edmund and George. Richard, Duke of York, and his second son, Edmund, were both killed in battle during the Wars of the Roses. The eldest son, Edward, was a very good soldier, and won the throne of England in battle against the reigning king, King Henry VI. Edward then became King Edward IV of England and his two brothers, George and Richard, became very powerful men.\nRichard married Anne Neville, whose father had once been a friend of the family. Richard and Anne had known each other since they were children, but Anne had been taken to France, where she had married the Prince of Wales, the son of Henry VI. When the Prince of Wales was killed in battle, Anne became a widow, and soon she was married to Richard, even though he had been her husband's enemy. Richard and Anne lived at Middleham Castle in North Yorkshire. They had one son, who was named Edward after Richard's brother, King Edward. Richard quarrelled frequently with his brother George, who was married to Anne's sister, Isabel. King Edward became so angry that he put George in prison, where he died.\nKing Edward married a woman called Elizabeth Woodville, who had been married before and had many relatives. Soon, her relatives became very rich and powerful, causing bad feeling among those who had been in the king's favour before the marriage. Edward and Elizabeth had several children, including two sons, who were named Edward and Richard.\nWhen Edward IV suddenly died in April 1484, his elder son became King Edward V, but he was still a boy. Richard had been asked by his brother the king to look after the two boys. He was worried that the new young king would not be able to rule the country properly. He was also worried that the Woodville family would soon be telling the king what to do and ruling the country for themselves.\nRichard the King.\nRichard took the throne from his nephew two months later. He claimed that Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was not a proper marriage, and that this meant Edward V could not be king. Parliament then passed a law that agreed with this. He was crowned as Richard III on 6 July 1483. \nRichard sent Edward and his brother to live in the Tower of London. A few months later, the princes in the tower disappeared and were never seen again. This became the mystery of the Princes in the Tower. At the time, many people believed that King Richard had ordered someone to kill them. Many historians agree, but there is no way to be certain. Richard was not in London at the time, but the boys were guarded by men who were loyal to him. As people started to believe that Richard had ordered the boys to be killed, many people turned against him. One of them was Richard's friend the Duke of Buckingham, who started a rebellion that failed. Henry Tudor, a distant relative of the House of Lancaster, then became Richard's main enemy. He returned to England and raised an army.\nRichard and Henry's armies fought each other at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Henry won the battle and became the next King of England, as Henry VII. Richard was killed in the battle, though probably not by Henry himself. He was the last English king to die in battle. He suffered two head wounds that would have killed him almost immediately. After the battle, his body was stripped of clothing and carried naked on the back of a horse to Leicester. He was buried in Greyfriars Church.\nRediscovery and reburial of the body.\nGreyfriars church was later demolished and the site became part of the garden of a large house. For about 200 years, a stone pillar marked the site of the grave. This had disappeared by 1844. Other buildings were added to the site over the years. By 1944, the area around the grave had become a car park for the nearby council offices. For a while, people thought that the body had been thrown into the river. There is a sign by the Bow Bridge in Leicester that tells this story, but it was not true.\nIn 2012, archaeologists began a project to try to find the body. On 24 August 2012, they started digging in the car park and found a skeleton on the first day. On 12 September, they suggested that the skeleton was that of Richard III. On 4 February 2013, they announced that they were sure it was him. They had used DNA testing to make sure. His skeleton shows that he had been killed by two head wounds, which similar to how 15th century writers had said he had died. It also shows that the body was further damaged after his death.\nOn 26 March 2015, Richard III's body was reburied. It now lies in a tomb in Leicester Cathedral.\nHistorian's views.\nThere has been discussion for many years about whether Richard III was a good king or a bad king. During his reign, which lasted only two years, he was very popular in parts of the country, especially the north of England. However, there were enough people who hated him to make sure that his enemies were able to raise a big army against him and defeat him in battle.\nIt is often said that \"history is written by the winners\". After Henry VII won, Richard III was often treated as a villain in writings and stories. For example, in Shakespeare's play \"Richard III\", he is shown to be totally evil. On the other hand, some writers from the time of Richard's reign make him a hero and ignore his flaws.\nIn 1605, William Camden wrote \"he lived wickedly, yet made good laws\". Modern historians also try to be careful when judging Richard III. For example, some historians have praised him for giving ordinary people more rights. However, many also think that he really did order the killing of the Princes in the Tower.\nAmong the laws Richard III made were removing limits on the printing and sale of books, more rights to people accused of a crime, laws to protect people from fraud when land was sold, bans on other types of fraud and changing the law from French into English. He created the Council of the North, which for the next 150 years would help solve problems in Northern England."}

It is base 2 because it uses two possible numbers: 0 and 1. Decimal, the system most of the world uses for daily life, is a base 10 system \u2013 it uses 10 characters (0\u20139). When binary numbers are written, a subscript \"(2)\" is added to distinguish them from the same number in base 10.\nComputers work in binary, because wires can store information in two different ways: by being powered, or not being powered. Sets of binary numbers can be used to represent any information, such as text, audio, or video. \nNumber system.\nWhen being introduced to binary numbers, it helps to go back and think about how base 10 or decimal numbers work. Consider the number 1101(10) (base 10). We identify this number as one-thousand, one-hundred, one because it has a 1 in the thousands place, a 1 in the hundreds place, and a 1 in the ones place. But since the places represent 8, 4, 2, and 1 in binary, instead of 1000, 100, 10, and 1, the value converted to decimal (base 10) would be 8 + 4 + 1 = 13(10). \nFor another example, the binary number 101(2) is 5 in decimal. The bit on the right is 1 and has a value of 1 (2^0). The middle bit has a value of 2 (2^1 or just 2), but it is a 0, so it is not added. The bit on the left is 1 and has a value of 4 (2^2 or 2 * 2). The bits that are 1s have values of 1 and 4. 1 + 4 = 5.\nComputers.\nAll computers use binary at the lowest level. Most hard memory, like compact discs and DVDs, use binary to represent large files.\nWith computers, eight binary bits together is called a \"byte\". The size of files is commonly measured in \"kilobytes\" or \"megabytes\" (sometimes in \"gigabytes\"). A kilobyte is 1000 bytes. A megabyte is 1000 kilobytes, a gigabyte is 1000 megabytes and a terabyte is 1000 gigabytes. Sometimes, it is easier to measure bytes in groups of 1024, since 1024 is a power of 2. There are 1024 bytes in a \"kibibyte\", 1024 kibibytes in a \"mebibyte\", and 1024 mebibytes in a \"gibibyte\". "}

Azuki beans have a long and varied history and there are many recipes. \nHistory and origin.\n\"Azuki\" beans are very famous red beans in Japan. Excavations suggest that people have been eating \"Azuki\" beans since the Jomon period. At that time, \"Azuki\" beans were called \"\"shozu\". \n\"Azuki\" beans have been grown since the \"Yayoi\" period. The first time the word \"Azuki\" was used was in the book \"Koziki\". Old Japanese said \"Aka\" for red. And \"Azuki\" beans were called \"zuki\" because \" Azuki\" beans get soft when they are boiled. \"Aka\" plus \"zuki\" is \"Azuki\"\" and this is the origin of \"Azuki\" bean's name. Another \"Azuki\" beans has many origins.\n\"Azuki\" beans are red, so many old people believed \"Azuki\" beans were a good luck charm. \"Azuki\" beans were used in many events and ceremonies in Japan, China and Korea. In the \"Edo\" period, people made rice mixed with \"Azuki\" \nbeans. This was called sekihan and many people gave \"sekihan\" at ceremonies. \"Azuki\" beans were used as medicine, because \"Azuki\" beans are nutritious. Now many people eat \"sekihan\" when there are ceremonies in Japan. In addition \"Azuki\" beans are used in many Japanese cakes, Many sweets use \"Azuki\" raw materials for the taste and colour. So \"Azuki\" beans are closely related to Japanese life from ancient times.\nAzuki bean jam.\nAzuki beans make bean jam. A sweet porridge of boiled and crushed azuki beans are eaten with rice-flour dumplings. Oval-shaped sweets are made from glutinous rice and covered with azuki bean. Bean-jam pancakes and bean-jam filled buns are also popular snacks. Azuki beans are also used in pillows and beanbags.\nRecipe.\nFirst, the azuki beans are boiled until the azuki skin stretches. The beans are then put into a perforated basket. Next, the azuki are boiled again for a short time to remove harshness. They are again put into perforated basket to drain. While they are draining, a big pan for steaming is prepared. The azuki are put in the pan and covered with a lid. The azuki beans are steamed and then heat is turned off. After steaming you have azuki bean mash, which is then dried on a cloth. The next step is putting them back in a pan to bring to a hot temperature. The azuki are taken out of the pan which is hot from flame. Sugar is added. The sugar and azuki are mixed and the water from the azuki is left. Finally, the azuki is cooled. When the beans are cold, it is finished.\nAzuki bean jam is used in many foods. For example, a fish-shaped waffle is filled with azuki bean jam. Azuki bean jam foods are famous in Japan, and they are eaten by many Japanese."}

The pomegranate originated in the region extending from Anatolia to northern India or South Asia.\nAlthough previously placed in its own family Punicaceae, recent phylogenetic studies have shown that \"Punica\" belongs in the family Lythraceae, and it is classified in that family by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.\nToday, it's widely cultivated throughout the Mediterranean countries. It is the most recognizable symbols of Turkey and used in drinks such as \u015ealgam.\nHistory.\nPomegranate has been used for thousands of years. Ancient people used it for high blood pressure, athletic performance, heart disease and diabetes. It's mentioned in Greek, Hebrew, Buddhist and Christian mythology and writings. It's described in records dating from around 1500 BCE as a treatment for tapeworm and other parasites. Pomegranate is one of the \"seven kinds\" of fruit mentioned in the Bible which Israel was blessed with long ago. It grew in the region for thousand of years and is very much adapted to:it sheds its leaves in the cold of our winters, while it sprouts in early spring when temperature rise. It ripens at the end of the summer, very close to the beginning of the Jewish New Year. it was and is used for decoration and blessing in ceremonies of the New Year celebration and the later holidays. It decorated temples in the past and appeared on ancient coins. Because of its decorative value in Israel, its selection was done mainly for external appearance , not so much for eating quality. Nice colour and crown are very important characteristics of the fruit. It was found in Indus Valley so early. It was cultivated in Egypt before the time of Moses. Arab caravans, many emanating from the lush oasis that was ancient Baghdad, probbably spread its use. \nDistribution.\nThe pomegranate tree is native from Iran to Himalayas in Northern India and has been cultivated since ancient times throughout the Mediterranean region of Asia, Africa and Europe. The most important growing regions are Egypt, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, India, Burma, Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia. There are some commercial orchards in Israel on the coastal pain and in Jordan Valley.\nName.\nThe name \"pomegranate\" comes from medieval Latin \"p\u014dmum\" \"apple\" and \"gr\u0101n\u0101tum\" \"seeded\".\nThe French term for pomegranate, \"grenade\", has given its name to the military grenade.\nCommon names in some other languages are:\n\"Punica granatum\", the scientific name of the pomegranate, was given by Carolus Linnaeus in 1753 in \"Species Plantarum\" (Vol. 1, page 472). \"Punica\" comes from the Latin name for the pomegranate, \"malum punicum\", meaning \"apple from Carthage\", and \"granatum\" from medieval Latin meaning \"seeded\", \"with seeds\".\nDescription.\nThe pomegranate is a shrub or small tree that could grow up to 10 meters of height with many branches with spines. Leaves are opposite long and broad. The flowers are yellow to bright red and in diameter, with three to seven petals.\nFruits are berries with a strong skin, like leather, intermediate in size between a lemon and a grapefruit, in diameter. Fruits have many seeds with and edible coats (called sacrotesta). The number of seeds in a pomegranate can vary from 200 to about 1400.\n\"P. granatum\" var. \"nana\" is a dwarf variety of \"P. granatum\" popularly planted as an ornamental plant in gardens and larger containers, and used as a bonsai specimen tree.\nWhere it grows.\nThe pomegranate originated in the region of modern-day Iran, and has been cultivated since ancient times throughout the Mediterranean region and northern India. It was brought into America in the late 16th century, including California, by Spanish settlers.\nToday, it is widely cultivated throughout the Middle East and Caucasus region, north and tropical Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, the drier parts of southeast Asia, and parts of the Mediterranean Basin. It is also cultivated in parts of Arizona and California.\nReferences.\n Annie has a big Panini"}

Later on, moats became more complicated and were used for show.\nMoats are deep, wide ditches filled with water. They were usually built near sources of water that flowed into the moats, filling them with water. The moats were filled with water for a few reasons. It made enemies swimming across the moat easy targets. It also made it impossible for enemies to dig underneath the castle walls, which was a common method of attack. It also prevented fires from destroying the castle. \nOrigin.\nThe word \"moat\" comes from the French word \"motte\", which means hill. Moats were first used in the Medieval period, from 1016 to 1164. Castles were built on the top of high hills. The area at the bottom of the hill was eventually called the moat. \nUsage.\nCastle moats were usually between 5 and 40 feet deep, and they were not always filled with water. Not all moats contained water, as a simple dry, wide ditch could prove an obstacle. These were called dry moats. \nIn many stories, moats are filled with alligators or crocodiles. This is a myth. However, moats were sometimes filled with fish or eels for food."}

Some roads also have a minimum speed limit, which is how slow a vehicle is allowed to travel.\nReasons.\nSafety.\nReducing speed reduces the number of accidents by giving more time to the driver to manage their vehicle. Reduces the consequences of an accident by reducing the energy involved in that crash.\nClimate and environment.\nBecause the emission of air pollutants increases disproportionately with increasing speed, speed limits are used to protect the climate and the environment. They are also used to reduce noise pollution.\nTraffic flow.\nMinimizing the speed differences in traffic leads to more consistent speeds, which increases road capacity and reduces the risk of congestion. This improves the flow of traffic.\nDue to the lower probability and severity of accidents, there are also fewer accident-related closures with a speed limit.\nDriving situation.\nSpeed limits are also used because they create a more relaxed atmosphere for drivers.\nSpeed limits in different countries.\nIn the UK, the speed limit in towns is usually 30 miles per hour, which is about 50 km/h, and the speed limit on dual carriageways and motorways is usually 70 miles per hour, which is about 105 km/h. In France, the speed limit on motorways is usually 130 kilometres per hour, which is about 80 miles per hour. Also, in the United States, most highways are from 65 to 70 miles per hour, and freeways are from 55 to 80 miles per hour. In Canada, the speed limit is usually about 100 km/h. In Australia the speed limit on freeways, highways and rural roads is between 100 and 130 kilometres per hour, and in towns and cities between 40 and 60 km/h but can go up to 90 km/h.\nNowadays, in the European Union, speed limits may vary from country to country or from region to region. Typical speed limits are 130 km/h or 120 km/h on rural motorways, between 80 and 100 km/h for rural roads, 70 km/h on point requiring a reduced speed, 50 km/h in main urban roads, and 30 km/h on residential urban areas.\nGermany does not have a general speed limit for its motorways, but a recommended speed (\"Richtgeschwindigkeit\") of 130 km/h.

It means displaying an image on a website by linking to the website hosting the image. The link gets the source data of the picture each time it is needed.\nThis avoids having the image on every website which uses it. So, a website owner uses a link to the picture such as \"http://example.com/picture.jpg\". When the hotlinking website is loaded, the image is loaded from the original website, which uses its bandwidth, so it costs the hotlinked website money. For this reason many website owners use .htaccess files to prevent hotlinking. In some cases website owners use the .htaccess file to replace any hotlinked images with an offensive image to deter any other website owners from hotlinking. Hotlinked images are usually hosted on sites like imgur.\nThe original image may be owned by the original website. It might be wrong to make a copy of the original image file for use on a different web page, without being careful to get proper permission.\nHotlinking can also be used for file types other than images, including documents and videos.\nExample.\nHotlinking is known as the act of stealing someone's bandwidth by linking directly to their website's assets, such as images or videos. For example, let's say the owner of website A is hosting a particular image on their server. The owner of website B sees that image and decides he wants it featured on his website as well. However, instead of downloading the image and hosting it on his own server, the owner of website B links directly to website A's domain.

Nuclear energy can be released by nuclear reactions in a machine called a nuclear reactor. This energy boils water for a steam engine to make electricity, which then can be used to power machines and homes. In 2007, 14% of the world's electricity came from nuclear power. Nuclear power plants also make radioactive waste that could be harmful if it is not stored properly.\nPeople have also been studying since the middle 20th century to use fusion power which produces much more energy and doesn't produce radioactive waste. Nuclear fusion reactors don't exist yet and are still being developed.\nHistory.\nEnrico Fermi made the first nuclear reactor in 1941. Many reactors were built in the U.S. during World War II during the Manhattan Project. In 1954 the first nuclear power plant started in Obninsk near Moscow. Most nuclear power plants in the U.S. were built during the 1960s and 1970s. Nuclear reactors also power some large military ships and submarines.\nEnergy production.\nNuclear reactors use a process called nuclear fission, which uses atoms like uranium or plutonium (In particular the isotope Uranium 235) and splits them apart with particles called neutrons. This converts some of the mass into energy, according to Einstein's equation E=mc2. The fissionable elements are placed into rods called 'fuel rods'. The fuel rods are submerged in water, and the energy released in the fission reaction heats up the water which turns into steam.\nThe steam then turns a turbine, which generates electricity. The steam is then condensed in huge cooling towers, and it turns back into water and is sent into the reactor again.\nThe reaction can be controlled by putting 'control rods' in between the fuel rods. The control rods are generally made of boron, which absorbs neutrons and stops the reaction.\nA nuclear meltdown can happen when the reaction is not controlled, and starts to generate dangerous radioactive gases (like Krypton). Contrary to popular belief, nuclear reactors can't explode like a nuclear bomb, but it is a danger when radioactive materials escape.\nAccidents.\nSome serious nuclear accidents have occurred. A scale was made to measure how dangerous accidents are. It is called the International Nuclear Event Scale. The scale has 8 levels (0-7), and 7 is the worst.\nNuclear-powered submarine mishaps include the Soviet submarine K-19 reactor accident (1961), the Soviet submarine K-27 reactor accident (1968), and the Soviet submarine K-431 reactor accident (1985).\nEconomics.\nThe economics of nuclear power is challenging, and following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.\nDebates.\nThere is a debate about the use of nuclear power. Supporters, such as the World Nuclear Association and IAEA, argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions. Additionally, it does not contribute to smog or acid rain. Anti-nuclear opponents, such as Greenpeace International and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, believe that nuclear power poses threats to people and the environment.\nRecent developments.\nIn 2007, nuclear power plants made some 2600 TWh of electricity and provided 14 percent of the electricity used in the world, which represented a fall of 2 per cent compared with 2006. As of May 9, 2010, there were 438 (372 GW) nuclear reactors operating globally. A peak was reached in 2002 when there were 444 nuclear reactors operating.\nThe nuclear emergencies at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power. Platts has said that \"the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world\". Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035."}

A computer software has different states in its life-cycle process from Development through deployment into Production and Sustainment. Each state in the process is given a unique version and version number. Versions are most often a sequence of one to four numbers (for example, 12.2.3) to represent Major.Minor.Maintenance actions, but can also use names, dates, or other sequencing mechanisms. In some practices, the numbers are used with variations like the 3rd digit being replaced by a letter (for example, 4.1a). The changes are all revisions in that something is being changed and the version number tells people how complex the change is to the software.\nMany times, after a program has been made, things called \"patches\" can be downloaded from the program's website.

Mostly sympathy means the sharing of unhappiness or suffering, but it can also mean sharing other (positive) emotions. In a broader sense, it can refer to the sharing of political or ideological sentiments, such as in the phrase \"a communist sympathiser\".\nThe psychological state of sympathy is closely linked with that of empathy, but is not identical to it. Empathy is understanding and feeling another person's emotions as they feel them, but makes no statement as to how they are viewed. \nSympathy, by contrast, implies a degree of equal feeling, that is, the sympathiser views the matter similarly to how the person themselves does. It thus implies concern, or care or a wish to reduce negative feelings others are experiencing."}

The word comes from the Greek \u1f44\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \"organon\", which means \"organ\", \"instrument\", or \"tool\".\nMost organs are played using keyboards, one or more of which may be played using the feet. They are found and used in churches, concert halls, and even in theatres, especially older movie theatres or cinemas. A person who plays the organ is called an organist.\nHere are some different types of organs:\nPipe organ.\nPipe organs are the most common kind of organ, and many people mean this kind of organ when they use the word \"organ\". They sound different notes when air flows through pipes of different lengths and types. They take up a lot of room, and the noise they make are meant to fill large spaces.\nThe earliest pipe organs were water organs, which were powered by the flow of water, sometimes from a natural resource or using a pump. Later ones used foot pedals or hand cranks to pump a bellows, which in turn produces the air that goes through the pipes. These kinds of organs are still made today, and are called harmoniums. Today's pipe organs ones use an electric motor to move air, and some, like those in theaters, play different instruments as well. The Wurlitzer company was well known for making instruments that make different sounds.\nMechanical organ.\nMechanical organs have a mechanism that controls which notes are played and when they are played. One type of mechanical organ is the barrel organ, which usually get their music printed on cardboard sheets, although some use piano rolls or a barrel similar to that of a carillon or music box.\nMechanical organs can be all shapes and sizes. The smaller barrel organs are often heard on streets in Europe and is a common way of getting money from people who pass by. These types are sometimes called hurdy gurdies, but this is not true. Larger barrel organs can be found on fairgrounds and are loud so that they can be heard above all the other noise at a fair. Meanwhile, smaller barrel organs can be found indoors, and play songs when someone puts in a coin, similar to a slot machine. Some clocks have barrel organ mechanisms that play music at certain times, such as every hour.\nElectronic organ.\nThe electronic organ is one of the newest types of organ. They use electronics to simulate the sound of a pipe organ and many other instruments. Because of this, they do not need to be very big and many are no bigger than a piano so that they can fit in homes, schools, or can be moved around as needed. They also do not go out of tune because it holds all its sounds on computerized chips. Many organists think they do not feel as good to play as a traditional, mechanical pipe-organ.\nThere are electronic organs that look and sound like those played in churches, and even many churches use electronic organs when they do not have the money or space for a full pipe organ. The best-known electronic organs include the Hammond organ heard in jazz, and other organs, like those made by the Japanese company Yamaha, are in fact synthesizers that can sound like a whole orchestra playing together. These types of organs are often used for music education, especially in Asia."}

Because of the size of the uterus,\nTypes of twins.\nThere are 2 types of twins. They are:\nFraternal twins.\nFraternal twins are also known as \"non-identical twins\" or \"dizygotic twins\". They happen when two ova are released from the ovary at the same time, and each is fertilized by a different sperm. This results in the birth of fraternal twins. They can be of different sexes. Genetically, they are no more similar than any two siblings.\nIdentical twins.\nIdentical twins or \"monozygotic twins\": A single ovum is fertilized to form one zygote. This zygote later splits, and each half of the zygote becomes a twin. The twins have the same genes.\nVariations.\nThere are five variations of twinning that occur commonly. The frequency varies in different populations. The three most common variations are all fraternal, meaning the two twins are not from the same egg: \nThe last two variations are identical twins, which means they come from one single egg that split later: \nOther animals.\nTwinning is common in many other species, such as cats, sheep, and ferrets. Twinning occurs in cattle about 1-4% of the time, and research is being done to improve the chances of twins being born. If an animal has twins it can be more profitable for the breeder, especially if there is a smaller chance of miscarriage."}

{"id": "45786", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45786", "title": "Identical twins", "text": "Identical twins start out as genetically identical: they have the same alleles. They are formed by a fertilised egg dividing into two separate individuals. They are always of the same sex, and are monozygotic or MZ twins (mono = one; zygote = fertilised egg). This contrasts with \"fraternal twins\", who are formed by two separate eggs fertilised by two separate sperms, and who are not always the same sex (DZ = dizygotic). Both types of twin are carried in the same uterus at the same time, so their birth environment is the same.\nResearch shows that the frequency of monozygotic twinning is one in 240 births. Fraternal twins are twice as common. In vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques are more likely to create dizygotic twins. For IVF deliveries, there are nearly 21 pairs of twins for every 1,000.\nTwin research.\nIdentical twins are natural clones. Because they start out with the same genes, they can be used to investigate how much heredity contributes to individual people. This is the nature vs nurture question.\nStudies with twins have been quite interesting. If we make a list of characteristic traits, we find that they vary in how much they owe to heredity. For example:\nThe way the studies are done is like this. Take a group of identical twins and a group of fraternal twins, and a group of siblings from the population. Measure them for various traits. Do a statistical analysis (such as analysis of variance). This tells you to what extent the trait is inherited. You will find that all those traits which are partly inherited will be significantly more similar in identical twins.\nStudies like this may be carried further, by comparing identical twins brought up together with identical twins brought up in different circumstances. That gives a handle on how much circumstances can alter the outcomes of genetically identical people.\nModern research has shown quite clearly that genetic inheritance does influence psychological aspects of life (how people behave), not just physical aspects.\nHistory.\nThe person who first did twin studies was Francis Galton, Darwin's half-cousin, who was a founder of statistics. His method was to trace twins through their life-history, making many kinds of measurement. Unfortunately, though he knew about mono and dizygotic twins, he did not appreciate the real genetic difference. Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s.\nWilhelm Weinberg made the first estimate of the rate of twinning. Realizing that identical twins would have to be the same sex, while non-identical twins could be either same or opposite sex, Weinberg derived a formula for estimating the frequency of MZ and DZ twins from the ratio of same and opposite sex twins to the total of maternities. Weinberg also estimated that the heritability of twinning itself was close to zero. That means the capacity to have twins is not hereditary.\nNot quite so identical.\nMonozygotic twins are genetically \"nearly identical\" and they are always the same sex unless there has been a mutation during development. Monozygotic twins always have different phenotypes. Twins may express different sexual phenotypes, normally from an XXY Klinefelter's syndrome zygote splitting unevenly.\nAlthough monozygotic twins are genetically almost identical, a 2012 study of 92 pairs of monozygotic twins found that monozygotic twins acquire hundreds of genetic differences early in fetal development. This is caused by mutations (or copy errors) taking place in the DNA of each twin after the splitting of the embryo. Another study in 2018 of 450 pairs of monozygotic twins showed that often (87%) the two twins varied in sexuality. the study also showed that if one twin married before 40, the other was also likely to marry before 40.\nIt is estimated that, on average, a set of monozygotic twins will have about 360 genetic differences that occurred early in fetal development.\nAnother cause of difference between monozygotic twins is epigenetic modification. These are caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives, which affects which genes are switched on or off. A study of 80 pairs of monozygotic twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few epigenetic differences. The number of epigenetic differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference. However, certain characteristics become more alike as twins age, such as IQ and personality. This phenomenon illustrates the influence of genetics in many aspects of human characteristics and behaviour.\nTwins in animals.\nTwinning is normal in many mammals, such as rats, cats, dogs. Identical twins are normal in a few species. The nine-banded armadillo, \"Dasypus novemcinctus\", gives birth to identical quadruplets.\nOffspring produced by non-sexual methods, such as parthenogenesis, are identical unless crossing over takes place in the production of eggs."}

It also says that the ark rested on the highest point in the area which was Mount Ararat, in what is now Turkey. \nThe size of the ship was 300 by 50 by 30 ells, according to Genesis 6:14. This makes it about half the size of the ship RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, or 155.45 by 25.91, by 15.54 metres. It would have had about the same tonnage (weight) as the RMS Titanic. \nThere have been many recorded sightings of the ark over the years, however no physical evidence has been proven to show that the ark is currently on Mount Ararat.\nDescription.\nAccording to the Bible, the ark was made of gopherwood. Gopherwood is possibly the wood of a cypress tree, which was used for making ships in the Middle East. Cypress was good for making ships because it had strong wood from a large trunk and limbs. However, no one knows for sure what kind of tree gopherwood was.\nThe ark was 300 cubits long, and 50 cubits wide; the height was 30 cubits. For a long time people did not know exactly how much a cubit was. One day in the later years of the 19th century, archaeologists found a tunnel in Jerusalem. This tunnel had been built in the days of King Hezekiah (around 700 B.C.). At the entrance was an inscription that said the tunnel was 1200 cubits long. The archaeologist measured the tunnel and saw it was 1800 feet long (54,000 centimeters). So now, people know that the Hebrew cubit, at least in the time of King Hezekiah, was 20.4\u00a0inches (51.816 centimeters).\nThe shape and size of the ark were very good for floating (the ark was made to float, not for quickly going through the water). Many cargo ships are built like Noah's ark, because this design is very steady in the water.\nAfter Noah had finished putting the ark together with the gopherwood boards, he had to make it \"watertight\" (so that water would not go inside the ark). According to the Bible, God told Noah to use pitch, a waterproof material to paint it inside and outside.\nThe building of the ark probably took Noah about 55-75 years, based on his age and the ages of his sons when the flood started.\nNaturalist approaches.\nDuring the Renaissance, a new kind of scholarship arose. These people never questioned the literal truth of the Ark story. They began to think about it from a practical point of view. In the 15th century, Alfonso Tostada wrote about the logic of the Ark, including things such as arrangements for getting rid of dung and circulating fresh air. The 16th-century geometrician Johannes Buteo worked out the ship's internal dimensions. He also allowed room for Noah's grinding mills and smokeless ovens. Later people also used his model.\nBy the 17th century, the Americas had been discovered and were being explored. This led to new problems. All the species had to be spread again from one point, after the flood. The obvious answer was that man had spread over the continents after the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The different groups took animals with them. Some of the results seemed peculiar, though: \"why had the natives of North America taken rattlesnakes, but not horses\", wondered Sir Thomas Browne in 1646? \"How America abounded with Beasts of prey and noxious Animals, yet contained not in that necessary Creature, a Horse, is very strange.\"\nBrowne was among the first people to question the notion of spontaneous generation. He was a medical doctor and amateur scientist making this observation in passing. Biblical scholars of the time such as Justus Lipsius (1547\u20131606) and Athanasius Kircher (c.1601\u201380) were also beginning to look at the Ark story more closely. They tried to fit the Biblical account with natural historical knowledge of their time. The resulting hypotheses were important. They were a driving force behind the study of the geographical distribution of plants and animals. This kind of study became biogeography in the 18th century. Natural historians began to draw connections between climates and the animals and plants adapted to them. One important theory said that the biblical Ararat was striped with different climatic zones. When climate changed, the associated animals moved as well. Eventually they spread to repopulate the globe. \nThere was also the problem of an ever-expanding number of known species: for Kircher and earlier natural historians, there was little problem finding room for all known animal species in the Ark, but by the time John Ray (1627\u20131705) was working, just several decades after Kircher, many more had been found. Incorporating the full range of animal diversity into the Ark story was becoming increasingly difficult, and by 1700 few natural historians could see any reasons to believe in a literal interpretation of the Noah's Ark narrative.\nFull-size replica.\nIn 2011, a full-size replica of Noah's ark was built in Dordrecht in the Netherlands."}

They brought different dialects of English with them. These different kinds of English began to mix and change. The newcomers soon began to speak with their own distinctive accent and vocabulary.\nMore and more people came to Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many people came looking for gold. Some came from Britain and Ireland. Others came from non-English speaking countries. Australian English continued to grow and change.\nAustralian English has also been influenced by American English. During the Second World War, there were many American soldiers staying in Australia. American television shows and music have been popular in Australia since the 1950s.\nAccent.\nThe Australian and New Zealand accents are similar. \nIn Australian English the /r/ sound can only occur before a vowel. Many words which sound different in other accents sound the same in Australian English. Some examples are:\nSome Australian English vowels sound different to vowels of other kinds of English. For example, the vowel in \"day\" starts with a very open mouth. This makes the Australian \"day\" sound close to the \"die\" of most British or American people. Days of the week, however, are often different and the \"day\" sounds like \"dee\" (usually short and sharp like the letter D).\nAustralian English has some vowels not used in some other kinds of English. For example, the words \"bad\" and \"lad\" do not rhyme because \"bad\" has a long vowel and \"lad\" has a short one. Also, \"cot\" does not sound like \"caught\" and \"bother\" does not rhyme with \"father\".\nAs with American English the /t/ sound can sometimes sound like a /d/ sound. This usually happens between vowels. So, for example, \nAlso in the Australian accent a /t/ sound plus the sound of \"you\" comes out sounding like \"chew\" and a /d/ sound plus the sound of \"you\" comes out sounding like \"Jew\". Here are some examples of things which sound the same.\nAustralians pronounce \"wh\" and \"w\" the same. Some examples are:\nWords.\nAustralians use many words that other English speakers do not use. The famous Australian greeting, for example, is \"G'day!\". A native forest is called \"the bush\" and the deserts in Australia is called the \"outback\".\nMany words were brought to Australia from Britain and Ireland. For example, \"mate\" meaning \"friend\" which is still used in Britain. Some of these words have changed in meaning. \nA few words have come from Australian Aboriginal languages. These are mainly names for animals, plants and places. Some examples are \"dingo\" and \"kangaroo\".\nSometimes we do not know where a word came from. For example, \"dinkum\" or \"fair dinkum\" means \"true\", \"is that true?\", \"this is the truth\". But nobody knows where the word is from: some say the word comes from Chinese, others say the word comes from England.\nSpelling.\nAustralian spelling mostly comes from British spelling. In words like \"organise\", \"realise\", where \"-ise\" is the expected and taught spelling method. In words like \"colour\", \"favourite\", \"-our\" is the norm, but there are exceptions such as the \"Labor\" Party (which was deliberately chosen on the formation of the Party to avoid confusion with the British Labour Party), \"Victor Harbor\" and \"Outer Harbor (geographically unique to the State of South Australia as opposed to place names in other States, e.g., \"Boat Harbour\" and \"Coffs Harbour\"). \n\"Program\" and \"jail\", on the other hand, are more common than \"programme\" and \"gaol\". Another couple of preferences of the American spelling is with \"analog\", not, \"analogue\" (in general, the -ue is dropped), \"livable\", not \"liveable\", \"guerilla\" not \"guerrilla\", \"verandah\" not \"veranda\", \"burqa\" not \"burka\", and \"pastie\", not \"pasty\". With the exception of \"spelt\", words that use -t in en-GB and end in -ed in en-US, Australia follows the US usage.\nKinds of Australian English.\nMost linguists split Australian English up into three main kinds. These are Broad, General, and Cultivated Australian English.\nBroad Australian English sounds very strongly Australian, when compared to other kinds of English. Steve Irwin spoke Broad Australian English.\nGeneral Australian English is the middle ground. It is used by most Australians, and can be heard in Australian-made films and television programs. Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman speak General Australian English. \nCultivated Australian English is similar to \"Received Pronunciation\", the type of British English spoken by people such as David Attenborough. Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush speak Cultivated Australian English.\nAustralian English demographics change from state to state but it's only slight compared to the variety of British and American English accents. A mixture of Broad and General Australian English accents can be heard across Southern and Western Australia, while Broad Accents are more common by themselves in states such as the Northern Territory and Central Australia. Large metropolitan areas such as Melbourne, Sydney and Southeast Queensland share large portions of each accent. Cultivated Australian English is rare compared to the rest but can be observed in the upper and middle classes, from migrant families with recent British ties (up to a century and a half in some cases) and in performing arts communities where pronounced English is of most benefit.\nSubtle changes on an individual level include how the letter 'a' sounds like in the words \"castle\", \"dance\", \"chance\", \"advance\", etc. Some use the vowel in \"calm\" others use the vowel in \"mat\" or \"mad\". Another regional difference is the pronunciation of 'e' sounds especially followed by 'l', such as \"Melbourne\", \"helped\", \"cellist\", with Victorians generally transposing the 'a' and 'e' vowel sounds in many words. For example, pronouncing an 'e' sound in words such as \"alchemy\" or \"chalice\", yet an 'a' vowel sound for \"Celery.\"\nThere are also geographical differences in the definition of words Australians use in different parts of the country as well. For example, \"football\" (or \"footy\" for short) means \"rugby league\" in NSW, Queensland and the ACT, but \"Australian rules football\" in everywhere else in Australia. In NSW, a swimming costume is called a \"cossie\" or \"swimmers\", in Queensland it is called \"togs\" and \"bathers\" in Victoria."}

All living conifers are woody plants, and most are trees.\nLiving conifers are all in the order Pinales. Typical examples include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauris, larches, pines, redwoods, spruces, and yews.\nSpecies of conifers can be found in almost all parts of the world, and are often the most common plants in their habitats, as in the taiga. Conifers are of great economic value, and their wood is mainly used for timber and paper making The wood of conifers is known as softwood, though yew wood is actually quite hard. The division \"Coniferae\" contains about 700 living species.\nEvolution.\nThe earliest conifers were in the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) period (about 300 million years ago), Pinophytes, Cycads, and Ginkgos all developed at this time. These plants live without being so dependent on water. Other adaptations are pollen (so fertilisation can occur without water) and the seed, which allows the embryo to be transported and developed elsewhere.\nConifers appear to be one of the taxa that benefited from the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event. They were the dominant land plants of the Mesozoic era. Conifers were eventually overtaken by the flowering plants, which first appeared in the Cretaceous. Flowering plants became dominant in the Cainozoic era.\nConifers were the main food of herbivorous dinosaurs, and their resins and poisons no doubt gave them some protection against herbivores.

The name of a species is made of two parts: one indicating the genus and one indicating the species. Binomial nomenclature means \"two-part name\" or \"system of two-part names\".\nHistory.\nThe person who popularized this system for use was Swedish botanist and physician Carolus Linnaeus (1707\u20131778). He gave a two-part name to every species he knew. This kind of naming had been used before Linnaeus by some naturalists, but after Linnaeus, it was accepted as a good method.\nValue of binomial nomenclature.\nThe value of the binomial nomenclature comes from several things. It saves words because it replaces long descriptions, it is used everywhere, and the names are unique and stable. The system ended the use of local common names, which was the source of much confusion. When science was done by just a few European countries their common names for species were well-known. But as it happened, the common names in all countries was rather different. The same name might be used for more than one species, and several species given the same name. In the Linnaeus system, everyone uses the same name for the same species. Linnaeus chose Latin names: first, because it avoided competitive nationalism; second, because most educated people in his day learned Latin.\nThe system has been a great success, but it does have some problems. It is not always clear what is a species and what is not. Although many species are quite clear, some are put into one species by some biologists, and into several species by others. Linnaeus himself noticed that species were not always distinct.Today we know something about why this is so. In practice, international committees make decisions about naming species in difficult cases.\nWhere names come from.\nThe components of a name may come from any source whatsoever. Often they are Latin words, but come originally from Greek. This is gradually changing, and names may now come from a Latinized version of a place, a person, a name from a local language, etc."}

For example, in computer networking, a disk subsystem is a part of a computer system.\nDefinition.\nOne of the founders of physiology, Claude Bernard, took a big step when he noticed that the internal systems of the body tend to keep things the same even if they are disturbed. He called the functions which keep system stable as homeostasis. This led towards the ideas of error-correction, feedback and regulation. These are all typical of systems which have some kind of goal and can adjust their behaviour so as to correct errors.\nExample.\nThe Solar System is an example of a system. The Solar System includes the Sun and the eight planets, as well as the moons of those planets. These and other members are linked by gravity and by their history as a planetary system.\nTypes of systems.\nThere are many kinds of systems. The key is that the elements of a system work together as a whole whilst still keeping their own identity. This is why planetary systems and body systems are good examples. They work together but have their own separate identity."}

It is native to the tropical region of America, mainly from southern Mexico to Central America. Now these plants are grown in all tropical regions of the world.\nPapayas are plants of tropical regions and, for growth and fruit production, they need a warm climate. They cannot live with low temperatures.\nThis is now the only species in its genus. As a result of genetic research, the other species were put in three new genera.\nNames.\nThe genus \"Carica\" was given that name by Linnaeus because the leaves of these plants are like those of the common fig (\"Ficus carica\").\nThe common name comes from the Ta\u00edno word \"pap\u00e1ia\" that was changed in Spanish to papaya, the word most used worldwide, with some changes. In Australia and some countries of the Caribbean, the fruit is called \"papaw\" or \"pawpaw\" but another North American plant, \"Asimina triloba\" of the Annonaceae family has also that name.\nThe French name for the fruit is \"papaye\" and \"papayer\" for the plant. In Portuguese, the fruit is called \"mam\u00e3o\", \"papaia\" or \"ababaia\" and the tree \"mamoeiro\" or \"papaeira\". In Kerala it commonly known as Kapanga - \u0d15\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19. In Spanish, there are other names besides papaya. In Cuba, it is called \"fruta bomba\" except in the eastern provinces where papaya is used. In the Dominican Republic, Los Llanos (Venezuela) and Eastern Central Colombia, the name is \"lechosa\". In Argentina and Paraguay, the fruit is called \"mam\u00f3n\".\nOther names and translations can be seen at Wiktionary.\nOverview.\nIt is a large plant, like a tree, usually without branches; it is a herbaceous plant because the stem does not have much wood and remains soft and green until its death. The single stem grows from 5 to 10 m tall with all the leaves on the top. The leaves are large, 50\u201370\u00a0cm wide.\nSome plants have perfect (with female and male organs) flowers but other plants have flowers with only one sex (female or male).\nGenerally, the fruit is oval to nearly round and, in some cases, like a big pear. Fruits are 15-50 cm long and 10\u201320\u00a0cm wide, and weigh up to 9 kg.\nThe skin of the fruit is thin and tough; it is not eaten because is too bitter. First, the skin is green but it changes to yellow in ripe fruits, ready to be eaten. In a ripe fruit, the pulp is yellow, orange, pink, and even light red. Inside the fruit, there are many small black seeds.\nUses.\nRipe papayas are eaten fresh, after taking out the skin and the seeds; sometimes, they are cut in small pieces and mixed with other fruits for a fruit salad. Papayas that are not completely ripe can be cut in pieces and cooked with sugar and eaten as dessert. In tropical regions, it is very popular to take papaya juice, after taking the skin and seeds out; this juice can be mixed with milk to make smoothies.\nGreen papayas, those that are not ripe, are eaten in some Asiatic countries in salads, curries and soups but they should be boiled before eating them. Young leaves and stems are also cooked as a vegetable. Green papaya is used in Thai cuisine, both raw and cooked.\nThe papaya is a source of iron and calcium; a good source of vitamins A, B and Riboflavin and an excellent source of vitamin C (ascorbic acid).\nThe latex (a sap like milk) from the green fruits, the leaves and the stem are rich in papain, an enzyme that breaks down tough meat fibers. Papain is a component in products (\"meat tenderizers\") sold in shops and that is used to make meat softer before cooking it.\nPapaya seeds have a peppery taste and are a great substitute for black peppercorns.\nReferences.\n7: https://www.achinhimanshujha-mylifeonweb.com/2021/09/papaya-leaves-health-benefits.html"}

They are different from the gymnosperms because angiosperms bear flowers, and have enclosed ovules. Gymnosperms bear naked seeds on cones or open structures.\nTypical adaptations.\nAngiosperms have a number of derived characters, which evolved as they split off from the gymnosperms.\nFlowers, the reproductive organs of flowering plants, are the most remarkable feature distinguishing them from other seed plants. Flowers, with their colour and their nectar, act to attract pollinators, which are mostly insects and birds. Whereas gymnosperms are almost entirely wind-pollinated, early flowers were probably all insect-pollinated. Some present-day flowering plants are wind-pollinated, but that is a secondary feature.p182\nThe fertilized angiosperm ovule develops into a seed, and the ovary develops into the fruit. The fruit is often a way to use animals to spread the seeds far and wide. The fruit is made out of the carpel and some tissue round it. The carpel hold inside itself the ovules.\nIn general, endosperms form after fertilization and before the first division of the zygote. Endosperm is a highly nutritive tissue that can provide food for the developing embryo, the cotyledons, and sometimes the seedling when it first appears.\nSpecialised sexual parts have led to co-evolution in fertilization and seed dispersal. The stamens, and the male and female gametophytes, have been adapted in many ways to suit particular pollinators. The smaller pollen grain shortens the time between pollination and fertilization, which can be up to a year in gymnosperms. The small female gametophyte also allows rapid seed production, which led to annual herbaceous life-cycles.\nAdaptations in these novelties allowed angiosperms to invade many habitats. They now dominate everywhere except the boreal forest or taiga, which is still composed almost entirely of gymnosperms.\nPhylogeny.\nA whole genome duplication (doubling) at 160 million years ago (mya) may have started the ancestral line that led to all modern flowering plants. That event was studied by sequencing the genome of an ancient flowering plant, \"Amborella trichopoda\". \"Amborella\", found on the Pacific island of New Caledonia, belongs to a sister group of the other flowering plants. Studies suggest that it has features that may have been characteristic of the earliest flowering plants. \nThe earliest known fossil confidently identified as an angiosperm, \"Archaefructus liaoningensis\", is dated to about 125 mya in the Lower Cretaceous. Pollen probably of angiosperm origin takes the fossil record back to about 130 mya. \nThe phylogeny of Angiosperms is as follows: \nThe territory is pretty much covered by three groups: the Magnoliids, the Monocots and the Eudicots. The Eudicots outnumber all other groups put together."}

For each star, the other is its \"companion star\". Many stars are part of a system with two or more stars. The brighter star is called the primary star, and the other is the secondary.\nBinary stars are important in astrophysics because looking at their orbits allows scientists to find out their masses. From this is got the mass\u2013luminosity relationship, and from this is got the masses of individual stars.\nBinary stars are not the same as line-of-sight \"optical double stars\", which look close together but are not connected by gravity. Optical double stars may actually be far apart in space, but binary stars are quite close together. The first person to discover and prove true binary stars was the Anglo-German astronomer William Herschel. He published the first catalogue of binary stars, and his son John Herschel found several thousand more and updated the catalogue. John Michell\u00a0first suggested that double stars might be physically attached to each other when he argued in 1767 that the probability that a double star was due to a chance alignment was small. William Herschel\u00a0began observing double stars in 1779 and soon after that he published catalogs of about 700 double stars.\nModern definitions.\nBy the modern definition, the term \"binary star\" is generally restricted to pairs of stars which revolve around a common centre of mass. Binary stars which can be resolved with a telescope or interferometric methods are known as \"visual binaries\". For most of the known visual binary stars one whole revolution (complete circle) has not been observed yet, they are seen to have travelled along a curved path or a partial arc.\nSome stars appear to be in orbit around empty space, and appear not to have a companion. In this case, the companion star is either very small and faint, or it is a neutron star or a black hole. The best-known example of a star with an invisible companion is Cygnus X-1, in which the visible star's companion appears to be a black hole.\nThe more general term double star is used for pairs of stars which are seen to be close together in the sky. This distinction is rarely made in languages other than English. Double stars may be binary systems or may be merely two stars that appear to be close together in the sky but have vastly different true distances from the Sun. The latter are termed \"optical doubles\" or \"optical pairs\".\nVisual binaries.\nA \"visual binary\" star is one for which the separation of the two stars can be seen with a telescope. The brighter star is the \"primary\" and the fainter star is the \"secondary\". Visual binaries take a long time to orbit one another, in the area of hundreds or even thousands of years.\nSpectroscopic binaries.\nA \"spectroscopic\" binary is one in which the two stars cannot be seen separately even with a telescope. They are very close together and move around each other very quickly, over a period of a few weeks or even a few days. However, they can be seen to be two separate stars by using a spectroscope, which is able to record the Doppler change in the color of the light sent out by stars moving quickly toward or away from the Earth. \nEclipsing binaries.\nSome spectroscopic binaries have an orbit that is edge-on to Earth. When this happens, the stars will take turns passing in front of and eclipsing the partner star, in what is called an \"eclipsing binary\". In this case, the amount of light we see from the double dims slightly during the time one star is in front of the other.\nAstrometric binaries.\nAn \"astrometric binary\" is one where only one companion can be seen. For astrometric binaries fairly near the Earth (up to about 10 parsecs), it may be possible to see the visible companion \"wobble\" as it moves around its invisible companion. By making measurements over a long period of time, it may be possible to calculate the mass of the visible star and how long its orbit takes. This method is also used to detect the presence of large planets orbiting a star; as of 2007, over two hundred planets have been discovered in this way.\nSystem properties.\nMost binaries are \"detached binaries\". Except for their gravitational pull on one another, they have no effect on each other.\nSome binaries are so close to one another that one or both stars is able to pull material from the other. Contact binaries share the same stellar atmosphere, and as friction slows them over a long period, they may merge into one star. This violent event temporarily makes them shine more brightly, brighter than a nova but less bright than a supernova.\nFormation.\nThough it could be possible that binary stars may form when one star passes very close to another, it is highly unlikely (since it would actually take three stars close to one another before two could join), and would occur only in places where stars are densely packed together. Our present understanding is that almost all binaries are formed together in the dense gas clouds where stars are born. \nRunaways and novae.\nIt is possible (though not likely) that a passing star will disrupt a binary system and provide enough gravitational force to split the binary. Such separated stars go on to live lives as ordinary single stars. Sometimes, though, enough gravitational force is involved that the two companions speed away from each other at great speeds, resulting in what is known as \"runaway\" stars.\nSometimes a star is in orbit around a white dwarf star. If it is large enough and close enough to the white dwarf, the dwarf may suck gasses from its companion's atmosphere. Over a period of time, a great deal of gas may collect on the white dwarf. As this gas is compacted by the white dwarf's gravity, it will eventually undergo nuclear fusion, resulting in a very bright outburst of light, known as a \"nova\". In some cases, the white dwarf may gather so much gas that the explosion completely destroys it, in what is called a \"supernova\". Such an event may also result in runaway stars, as the larger star no longer has a heavy companion which keeps it in orbit.\nX - Ray Binaries.\nX - Ray Binaries produce great amounts of X-ray radiation. They result from a massive star eating a less massive star. The lesser star becomes a donor and its matter is drained out and falls into the more massive (but more compact) star, the accretor. This releases high energy photons, for example in the X-Ray range of wavelengths. The X-Rays also come from the consumption of material on the surface of the more massive star in a process called thermonuclear burning. This can make 10 second bursts."}

Cosmic rays from the Sun also make muons:\nMuon decay.\nMuons are unstable elementary particles. They are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter than all other particles. They decay via the weak interaction. Because the total of the lepton numbers of the starting and ending particles must be the same, one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type antineutrino. Because charge must be kept the same, one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon. So, all muons decay to at least an electron, and two neutrinos. Sometimes, besides these necessary products, additional other particles that have a net charge and spin of zero (e.g., a pair of photons, or an electron-positron pair), are produced.\nThe dominant muon decay mode (sometimes called the Michel decay after Louis Michel) is the simplest possible: the muon decays to an electron, an electron-antineutrino, and a muon-neutrino. Antimuons, in mirror fashion, most often decay to the corresponding antiparticles: a positron, an electron-neutrino, and a muon-antineutrino."}

The goal of CPR is to force blood and oxygen to keep flowing through the body. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive. CPR does not start a person's heart again. However, it can keep pushing blood and oxygen around the body long enough that sometimes, it can keep the body from getting damaged by not having enough oxygen.\nThere are different types of CPR. Regular people, who are not medical professionals, can do these things:\nMany medical professionals can also do these things:\nStatistics.\nTime is very important. Each minute that passes before CPR is started lowers the chance of survival by about ten percent. If CPR starts within the first three to five minutes, and a defibrillator is available, the chance of survival can be as high as 50%, or even 75% (That is: one out of two, or three out of four survive). In European countries, emergency services take about eight minutes or more to arrive, once they have been alerted. A victim's survival therefore largely depends on other people who are there and what they do. A quick call to emergency services, and a quick start of basic CPR, especially defibrillation, can double to triple the chance of survival - with adults and children."}

He is one of the most famous people from Finland and one of the greatest composers of symphonies of all times. He was born at a time when Russia had a lot of power in Finland and the Finnish people were trying hard to keep their own culture and their independence. This nationalism can be heard in a lot of his music, especially some of the choral music. After 1928 he composed very little. He lived in retirement in his home in the Finnish countryside.\nHis life.\nEarly life.\nJean (pronounced the French way) was born 100\u00a0km north of the Finnish capital Helsinki. His grandfather had changed the family name from a Finnish name to the Latin-sounding \u201cSibelius\u201d. His father died during a cholera epidemic when Jean was very young. His family spoke Swedish at home, but when he was eleven he went to a Finnish-speaking school. He learned to play the violin and wanted to be a soloist. He loved reading the \"Kalevala\" which was a long epic poem about the old Finnish legends. He also loved the Swedish-speaking poets who wrote poems about nature.\nIn 1885 he went to Helsinki to study law but he soon gave up law and concentrated on his violin studies and composition. He went to Berlin to continue his music studies. He became good friends with the pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni and went with him to Leipzig. At this time he had mainly written chamber music. In Vienna he had lessons from Karl Goldmark and heard lots of orchestral music. He spent a lot of his money, much of it on drink which was to be a big problem for him for many years.\nEarly success.\nHe went back to Finland in 1891. He earned money by teaching. He wrote a big work for orchestra and singers called \"Kullervo \". The words were in Finnish, the story was from the poem \"Kalevala\". This work made him famous.\nIn 1892 he married Aino J\u00e4rnefelt. Her father was a general and very keen on the Finnish language. The Finnish were trying more and more at this time to be free of rule by Russia. Sibelius wrote more patriotic music during the 1890s e.g. the tone poem \"En Saga\" and the \"Lemmink\u00e4inen\" legends which include the popular \"The Swan of Tuonela\". His patriotic tone poem \"Finlandia\" is still very popular today. His music at this time was influenced by Wagner and Tchaikovsky. He also heard Finnish folk melodies and, although he does not use them directly in his music, they became part of his musical language. In 1897 he was given a state pension which helped him financially although for many years he was still very often short of money because he had expensive tastes.\nMature years.\nBetween 1899 and 1924 Sibelius composed the 7 symphonies which made him famous worldwide. His friend, the conductor Kajanus, conducted Sibelius\u2019s works when he took the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra on tour around Europe. His wife was becoming worried about how much alcohol he was drinking in Helsinki, so 1903 she persuaded him to move the family to a place called Ainola in the Finnish countryside. They had a house built in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4. Apart from a few short periods in Helsinki he spent the rest of his life there. The first works he wrote there were his \"Symphony no 2\" and the \"Violin Concerto \". He became seriously ill in 1908 and for several years he had to stop smoking cigars and drinking alcohol. He continued to travel and visited England several times and the United States in 1914 where he was very popular. After the war he continued to write more symphonies as well as some short, light pieces. The last great work that he wrote was the tone-poem \"Tapiola\" in 1926. He tried to write another symphony (no 8) but gave up and destroyed it. He never wrote any more music. He continued to live in retirement in his house in the Finnish country for another 30 years. He died of a brain hemorrhage. The house is now a Sibelius museum.\nFamily life.\nSibelius's wife Aino came from a highly respectable family. Although her father was a general in the army, there was a very great interest in culture in the J\u00e4rnefeld family which included musicians, painters and poets. Jean fell in love with Aino on his first visit to her home. Aino was to be a faithful wife to him all his life, although she suffered a lot of hardship due to his drinking problems and his debts. They had five daughters.\nHis works.\nSibelius is best known for his symphonies and tone-poems. His symphonies are very different from one another, none can be described as being \u201ctypical\u201d of his style. The early symphonies are Romantic in character, in the later symphonies he tries out lots of new ideas and sounds. His \"Violin Concerto\" is played by all the great violinists. Sibelius wrote lots of songs for voice and piano. These are mostly settings of Swedish poems. He also wrote many choral works, mostly in Finnish. These vocal works are not so well known outside Finland because the language is not familiar abroad, but there are some very good songs, especially \"Luonnotar\". Besides his important works he also wrote many short works in order to earn enough money to live. These include songs as well as many short piano pieces.\nSibelius's music today is extremely popular. His music has also been an influence on recent composers."}

For example, they ran the Nazi concentration camps and death camps, where they killed millions of people. After World War II, judges at the Nuremberg Trials ruled that the SS was an illegal criminal organization. The judges also said that the SS was the organization that had done most of the Holocaust.\nThe SS is created.\nThe SS was created in the 1925 to guard Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. (\"Schutzstaffel\" means \"Protection Squadron\" in German).pp.26-29 From 1929 to 1945, Heinrich Himmler led the SS. During that time, the SS grew from a small paramilitary unit to one of the largest and most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany.p.47\nThe Nazis saw the SS as a special unit, like the Praetorian Guard (which used to guard Roman emperors). To be chosen for the SS, a person had to be racially \"pure\". This meant they had to prove that all their ancestors were \"Aryan\". They also had to be completely loyal to the Nazi party. They could never ask questions or disagree with anything the SS did.\nParts of the SS.\nThe SS had two different parts. The \"Allgemeine-SS\" (\"General SS\") were the Nazis' police. The \"Waffen-SS\" (\"Armed SS\") were special units of soldiers in Nazi Germany's military. The Waffen-SS became known for fierce fighting and brutality against civilians and prisoners of war. Its units helped crush the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, where Polish Jews tried to fight back against the Nazis. Waffen-SS units also killed many American prisoners of war during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944.\nThe SS was militaristic but not military. It had its own rank system, insignia, and uniforms. This made the SS different from the German military, the Nazi party, and people who worked in the German government.\nThe SS gains power.\nAs the Nazi party gained more and more power in Germany, it gave control of more important jobs (like law enforcement) to the SS. Many SS organizations became as powerful as parts of the government. The Nazi party decided that to help it keep its power, it needed to give the SS two even more important jobs. One of these was to create and run the Sicherheitsdienst (\"SD\"), the Nazi security and intelligence service. The other was to control the \"Geheime Staatspolizei\" (\"Gestapo\"): the SS secret police. Because it was in charge of so many important things, the SS could do almost anything it wanted.\nRole in the Holocaust.\nAs the SS's leader, Heinrich Himmler used the SS to put the Final Solution into action. The SS Einsatzgruppen murdered many civilians, mostly Jews, in the countries controlled by Nazi Germany during World War II. The SS was in charge of creating and running concentration camps and death camps (camps where people were sent to be killed). In these camps, millions of prisoners died from many causes, including murder, starvation, disease, freezing to death, and being experimented on by Nazi doctors like Josef Mengele. \nAfter the war.\nAfter the war, the judges at the Nuremberg Trials decided the SS was a criminal organization (a group that was created only to commit crimes). They ruled that the SS had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. They also said that the SS was the organization that had carried out most of the Holocaust."}

They are related to exponential functions. A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation. Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.\nAn example of a logarithm is formula_1. In this logarithm, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3. In this case, the exponentiation function would be:\nformula_2\nThe most common types of logarithms are common logarithms, where the base is 10, binary logarithms, where the base is 2, and natural logarithms, where the base is e \u2248 2.71828.\nHistory.\nLogarithms were first used in India in the 2nd century BC. The first to use logarithms in modern times was the German mathematician Michael Stifel (around 14871567). In 1544, he wrote down the following equations: formula_3 and formula_4. This is the basis for understanding logarithms. For Stifel, formula_5 and formula_6 had to be whole numbers. John Napier (1550\u20131617) did not want this restriction, and wanted a range for the exponents.\nAccording to Napier, logarithms express ratios: formula_7 has the same ratio to formula_8, as formula_9 to formula_10 if the difference of their logarithms matches. Mathematically: formula_11. At first, base e was used (even though the number had not been named yet). Henry Briggs proposed to use 10 as a base for logarithms, such logarithms are very useful in astronomy.\nRelationship with exponential functions.\nA logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation.\nJust as an exponential function has three parts, a logarithm has three parts as well: a base, an argument and an answer (also called power).\nThe following is an example of an exponential function: \nIn this function, the base is 2, the argument is 3 and the answer is 8.\nThis exponential equation has an inverse, its logarithmic equation:\nIn this equation, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3.\nDifference to roots.\nAddition has one inverse operation: the subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: the division. However, exponentiation actually has \"two\" inverse operations: root and logarithm. The reason why this is the case has to do with the fact that the exponentiation is not commutative.\nThe following example illustrates this:\nUses.\nLogarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easier, because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying, and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing.\nBefore calculators became popular and common, people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The same information in a logarithm table was available on a slide rule, a tool with logarithms written on it.\nAside from computations, logarithm also has many other real-life applications:\nCommon logarithms.\nLogarithms to base 10 are called common logarithms. They are usually written without the base. For example:\nThis is true because:\nNatural logarithms.\nLogarithms to base \"e\" are called natural logarithms. The number e is nearly 2.71828, and is also called the Eulerian constant after the mathematician Leonhard Euler.\nThe natural logarithms can take the symbols formula_19 or formula_20. Some authors prefer the use of natural logarithms as formula_21, but usually mention this on preface pages.\nProperties of logarithms.\nLogarithms have many properties. For example:\nProperties from the definition of a logarithm.\nThis property is straight from the definition of a logarithm:\nThe logarithm to base \"b\" of a number \"a\", is the same as the logarithm of \"a\" divided by the logarithm of \"b\". That is,\nFor example, let \"a\" be 6 and \"b\" be 2. With calculators we can show that this is true (or at least very close):\nThe results above had a small error, but this was due to the rounding of numbers.\nSince it is hard to picture the natural logarithm, we find that, in terms of a base-ten logarithm:\nOperations within logarithm arguments.\nLogarithms which multiply inside their argument can be changed as follows:\nFor example,\nSimilarly, logarithm which divides inside the argument can be turned into a difference of logarithm (because it is the \"inverse operation\" of multiplication):\nLogarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications.\nBefore electronic computers, logarithms were used every day by scientists. Logarithms helped scientists and engineers in many fields such as astronomy.\nBefore computers, the \"table of logarithms\" was an important tool. In 1617, Henry Briggs printed the first logarithm table. This was soon after Napier's basic invention. Later, people made tables with better scope and precision. These tables listed the values of log\"b\"(\"x\") and \"b\"\"x\" for any number \"x\" in a certain range, at a certain precision, for a certain base \"b\" (usually \"b\" = 10). For example, Briggs' first table contained the common logarithms of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 8 digits. \nSince the function is the inverse function of log\"b\"(\"x\"), it has been called the antilogarithm. People used these tables to multiply and divide numbers. For example, a user looked up the logarithm in the table for each of two positive numbers. Adding the numbers from the table would give the logarithm of the product. The antilogarithm feature of the table would then find the product based on its logarithm.\nFor manual calculations that need precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier ways.\nMany logarithm tables give logarithms by separately providing the characteristic and mantissa of \"x\", that is to say, the integer part and the fractional part of log10(\"x\"). The characteristic of is one plus the characteristic of \"x\", and their significands are the same. This extends the scope of logarithm tables: given a table listing log10(\"x\") for all integers \"x\" ranging from 1 to 1000, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by\nAnother critical application was the slide rule, a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation, as illustrated here:\nNumbers are marked on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. Many engineers and scientists used slide rules until the 1970s. Scientists can work faster using a slide rule than using a logarithm table."}

He played with the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and the Boston Braves, and hit 714 home runs in his career. Only two players, Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds, have hit more. At the beginning of his career, he was a pitcher. He is widely considered the greatest baseball player of all time.\nNicknames.\nBabe Ruth has been called by many nicknames. Some of the most common are: \"The Great Bambino\", \"The Sultan of Swat\", \"The of Clout\", \"The Titan of Terror\", and \"The King Of Crash\" .\nEarly career.\nRuth learned to play baseball while growing up in Baltimore, Maryland.His first Major League Baseball (MLB) team was the Boston Red Sox. Ruth began playing as a pitcher. He had some of the best pitching statistics in baseball. The Red Sox won the World Series in 1915, 1916, and 1918.\nAt that time, there was no designated hitter rule in the American League, where the Red Sox played, so Ruth got chances to hit as a pitcher. The team realized that he was also good at hitting. In 1918, Ruth began hitting more and pitching less. Later in his career, he became an outfielder.\nRuth was becoming a star player. However, by 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee was having problems with money. In 1920, the Red Sox sold Ruth to the New York Yankees for cash. Even though the Red Sox had won several World Series in the years before this, they would not win another one until 2004. Many baseball fans believed that the Red Sox had become \"cursed\" by trading Ruth, and called this the \"Curse of the Bambino\".

Despite this, Korn have been quoted for disliking the term and even being called 'metal'. Jonathan Davis has said that Korn's music can not be classified and that it contains many other influences besides simply 'metal'. The official review on the iTunes Store for their first album goes as far as saying that Korn \"hate the term\".\nTheir first album was first sold in 1994 and also called KoRn. Since then, Korn has sold over 35 millions records worldwide - including 16,5 millions in the U.S., making them one of the best-selling metal acts of the last twelve years.

It is most commonly used as a pain killer, or to reduce fever or inflammation. It also has an anti-platelet effect - it reduces the number of platelets in the blood which reduces blood clotting- in that function it is used to prevent heart attacks. Aspirin is one of the most-used medical drugs in the world.\nThere are some possible side-effects to this drug. For example, large amounts can damage the kidneys. Children taking aspirin can develop Reye's syndrome which causes the liver to become fatty and not work properly and also the brain to become enlarged. Reyes syndrome can be fatal, but most children survive it with treatment.\nPeople with lung, kidney disease, gout, hyperuricemia (high amounts of uric acid in the blood), hemophilia (a blood clotting disorder), diabetes or high blood pressure should not take aspirin except on the advice of a qualified medical professional. Nor should people who are allergic to it, to ibuprofen or to naproxen. People with asthma where attacks are brought about by aspirin should avoid using any anti-inflammatory drugs based on it.\nAspirin was invented in Germany in 1897. Bayer has a trademark on the brand name \"aspirin\" in 80 countries. But in other countries, \"aspirin\" is the common name for the drug."}

{"id": "46011", "revid": "1085833", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46011", "title": "Transpiration", "text": "Transpiration is the evaporation of water from plants, especially leaves. It is a type of translocation and part of the water cycle. The amount of water lost by a plant depends on its size, the light intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil water supply. The process of Transpiration helps in regulating temperature in the plant. \nTranspiration was first worked out by Stephen Hales (17 September 1677 \u2013 4 January 1761), an English clergyman. He proved what is still believed, that the evaporation of water molecules from leaves is the main force pulling the water column up from its origin in the roots.\nHow transpiration works.\nLeaf surfaces are dotted with openings called stomata, which act rather like pores. In most plants there are more on the undersides of the leaves than on the top. The stomata are bordered by guard cells that open and close the pore. Transpiration happens when the guard cells open the stomata. This lets oxygen and water vapour flow out, and carbon dioxide flow in. The carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis, and the oxygen is produced by photosynthesis.\nTranspiration also pulls water through the plant. This brings with it the mineral nutrients from roots to shoots. Water moves out of the leaves into the atmosphere. This exerts a pull on the water column, which brings the water up against gravity. Water gets into the plant at the roots by osmosis, and it transports dissolved mineral nutrients to the upper parts of the plant through the xylem. A fully grown tree may lose hundreds of gallons (thousands of liters) of water through its leaves on a hot, dry day. About 90% of the water that enters a plant's roots is used for this process; most of the rest is used in photosynthesis.\nDesert plants and conifers have adaptations which reduce water loss. Examples are: thick cuticles, reduced leaf areas, sunken stomata and hairs. All these reduce transpiration and conserve water. Many cacti do photosynthesis in succulent stems, rather than leaves. The surface area of even a fat stem is far less that the total surface of leaves in a tree. Also, stomata of desert plants are usually closed during the day and open at night, when transpiration is lower."}

It is found on plant leaves and stems, and any other green parts of the plant. It is used for gas exchange. Stomata are mostly found on the \"under-surface\" of plant leaves. Almost all land plants have stomata.\nStomata have two main functions. First is gaseous exchange i.e. intake of carbon dioxide and release of oxygen. The second is the process of transpiration in plants.\nAir enters the plant through these openings. The carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis. Some of the oxygen produced is used in respiration. Surplus oxygen exits through these same openings. Also, water vapor goes into the atmosphere through these pores in transpiration.\nThe pore is formed by a pair of cells known as guard cells. These adjust the size of the opening by opening or closing. To open a guard cell, protons (hydrogen ions, H+) are pumped into the guard cells. Water enters into them, the cells gets filled, and they open."}

This technique is different from amplitude modulation which varies the amplitude, but keeps the frequency constant.

When transmitting analogue sound, the sound quality of FM signals is better than that of amplitude modulation (AM) signals. However, FM signals do not travel as far as AM beause they use higher frequencies that do not bounce off the Kennelly\u2013Heaviside layer.\nMany radio stations send out both kinds of signals. AM may be used for talk shows, and FM for music. FM broadcasting usually includes a difference signal, which can cause two different speakers at home to create different sounds.

The problem is based on a television game show from the United States, \"Let's Make a Deal\". It is named for this show's host, Monty Hall.\nIn the problem, there are three doors. A car (prize of high value) is behind one door and goats (booby prizes of low value) are behind the other two doors. First, the player chooses a door but does not open it. Then the host opens a different door. The host knows what is behind every door, and always chooses a door with a goat behind it. (If there are goats behind both other doors, one is chosen at random.) Last, the player choose whether to keep what is behind the first door or to change to the third door (the one the host did not open).\nThe rules of the problem are that the host has to open a door with a goat behind it and the player has the opportunity to switch. The question is whether changing choices increases the chances of getting the car.\nMost people feel that the car is equally likely to behind either of the two doors that are still closed, so that changing doors does not affect the chance of getting the car. The true answer is that changing choices increases the chances of getting the car from 1/3 (one out of three) to 2/3 (two out of three).\nThat 2/3 (two out of three) chance comes from the fact in the initial door choice, the player has a 1/3 (one out of three) chance of picking the door with the car. There is a 2/3 (two out of three) chance if the car is behind one of the other two doors. If the player could switch from their one\" door to the other two doors this would improve their chances. The fact that the host reveals that one of the other doors contains a goat does not change this probability. The player is still effectively swapping their one\" door for the other two (even though one of them has been opened).\nThese are the options:\n1. (Lose): If the player picks the car, then the host will show a goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a goat .\n2. (Win) : If the player picks a goat, then the host will show the other goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.\n3. (Win) : If the player picks the other goat, then the host will show the first goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.\nSo, it is true that if the player changes (switches) then the player will win a car two times out of three."}

Emergency services usually include police, medical, or firefighting public services. Many countries' public telephone networks have a single emergency telephone number, sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or the emergency services number. Most emergency service numbers are 3 digits long so that they can be dialed quickly and remembered easily. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services and are different only by the last digit. \nVariations.\nIn Europe, the telephone number for emergency services is 1-1-2. In North America, the number for emergency services is 9-1-1. It can be dialed from any phone connected to a network, as a cellular service plan isn't required or charged for emergency calls. Some countries, such as Israel, maintains separate but consecutive numbers for police, fire, and medical services. When the number is dialed on the phone keypad, the call is routed to the nearest emergency telephone operating center. This center is oftentimes found within the same city or town that the call is made from. This provides a strong connection and allows emergency services to get to the location better. In some areas, calls are able to be traced on a map with GPS from cell towers. This can be helpful if a person calls but is unable to speak or if the telephone connection line disconnected before the call was ended intentionally. \nTechnological Implications.\nThe ability to contact emergency services has changed in recent years as technology has advanced. Some mobile devices like the Apple iPhone and Apple Watch and mobile applications such as Noonlight offer capabilities to contact emergency services without having to call or speak to an emergency phone operator. These features are still being tested and developed by using a smart phone's ability to maintain a very accurate GPS location. "}

He was one of the most important composers of his day and he wrote lots of different kinds of music. A lot of his music is based on hymns of the Protestant church.\nWe are not quite certain about the date of his birth. He was born at a time when there was a lot of argument about religion in Germany. His father was a strict Lutheran and lost his job more than once because of his beliefs. We know very little about the life of Praetorius. He seems to have gone to the Lateinschule (\u201cLatin School\u201d) in Torgau where he had music lessons from Michael Voigt. He probably never had music lessons after he left school. Then he went to the University of Frankfurt an der Oder. There Praetorius graduated in divinity. Afterwards he found a job as organist to the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. He soon earned a good salary. He married in 1603 and had two sons.\nAlthough he had his job in Wolfenb\u00fcttel for many years he also worked a lot in Dresden where he met Heinrich Sch\u00fctz and in Magdeburg where he met Samuel Scheidt. His health was not good, possibly because he worked so hard. When he died he left a lot of money to the poor.\nHis music.\nPraetorius wrote a very large amount of music. Much of it has been lost. He wrote a collection of French dances called \"Terpsichore\" for a small group of instruments. These are very happy pieces and are very popular today. A lot of his music is based on Protestant hymns, written for the services in the Lutheran church. He liked to write music in which two groups of singers or instrumentalists alternate (take it in turns to sing/play). His music for choir, which includes many motets, shows him to be one of the best composers of his time. He liked to write music for two, three or four choirs (all singing different parts). The tune would be in the top part so that the congregation could join in.\nHis theory works.\nPraetorius wrote a book about music theory called \"Syntagma Musicum\". Part One talks about religious music. It is very interesting for us today because it tells us a lot about the way that Martin Luther wanted to change music in the church services. In Part Two he described the musical instruments of his day. Part Three talks about musical forms: this included discussions about things like music notation (the way music was written), transposition (music), solmization and how to write for large choirs. He was going to write a Part Four in which he wanted to discuss the technique of musical composition, but he died before he could write it."}

They do not play tunes because they have no definite pitch (although often a definite pitch can just be heard when listening carefully.)\nSome musicians have a sense of absolute pitch or pitch perfect. This means that they always know what note is being played, even without comparing it to another note. Having a sense of absolute pitch does not necessarily make someone a good musician, although it can be very useful.\nThere is evidence to suggest that well-known composers of classical music, such as Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach, had developed and perhaps even mastered their sense of pitch.\nPitch is often confused with frequency. Frequency is used as a scientific means for measuring and changing sound and its possible pitches, though pitch is used to describe a more psychological. "}

{"id": "46117", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46117", "title": "Sebaceous gland", "text": "The sebaceous glands are microscopic (tiny) glands in the skin which produce an oily/waxy substance, called sebum, to lubricate (oil) the skin and hair. In people, these glands are found in greatest amounts on the face and scalp, joined near the top inside hair follicles or sweat pores. However, they are in all skin areas except the palms and soles (undersides) of the feet.\nThere are different kinds of these glands and sebum. In the eyelids, meibomian sebaceous glands emit a special kind of sebum into tears. There are several related medical conditions, including: acne, sebaceous cysts, hyperplasia, sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma (see section below: \"Diseases\").\nWashing skin or hair with plain detergent can cut the amount of sebum in oily skin. Also, water temperature over can keep sebum melted during a wash.\nLocations and morphology.\nAs a branched kind of acinar gland, the sebaceous glands are found in people all over the skin except in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\nSebaceous glands are often found in hair-covered areas, where they are connected near the top of hair follicles (\"see image at top\"). The glands deposit sebum on each hair, and bring it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The structure consisting of hair, hair follicle, arrector pili muscle, and sebaceous gland is known as a pilosebaceous unit.\nSebaceous glands are also found in non-haired areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, and nipples. Here, the sebum travels along ducts which end inside \"sweat pores\" near the surface of the skin.\nAt the rim of the eyelids, meibomian glands are a specialized form of sebaceous gland. They secrete a form of sebum (known as meibum) onto the eye, which slows the drying of tears.\nSebum.\nSebaceous glands produce the oily, waxy substance called \"sebum\" (Latin, meaning \"fat\" or \"tallow\") that is made of fat (lipids), wax, and the leftover dead fat-producing cells. In the glands, sebum is produced within specialized cells and is released as these cells burst; sebaceous glands are thus classified as holocrine glands.\nSebum has no odor, but its bacterial breakdown can produce a bad odor. Sebum is the cause of some people experiencing \"oily\" hair,\nas in hot weather or if not washed for several days. Earwax is partly composed of sebum. Sebum can be washed using plain detergent, to dissolve the waxy material in the skin. Also, water for washing should be over to keep the sebum molten.\nExcess sebum has been linked to eating red meats, fried and oily foods and some other type of foods but different research shows multiple theories about it.\nFunction.\nIt is commonly believed that sebum acts to save skin from drying or to waterproof hair and skin. But some scientists have contended that \"low levels of sebaceous gland activity are not correlated with dry skin\", and it may serve little or no purpose in modern humans.\nComposition.\nThe substances in sebum vary between species. In people, the lipid content is as follows:\nAlso, sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is found only in people, not in animals.\nControl.\nThe following medicines have been shown to reduce the flow of sebum from skin:\nChanges during development.\nThe sebaceous glands of a human fetus \"in utero\" secrete a substance called Vernix caseosa, a \"waxy\" or \"cheesy\" white substance covering the skin of newborn babies.\nThe activity of the sebaceous glands increases during puberty because of heightened levels of androgens. In males, sebaceous glands begin to appear predominantly on the penis, on the shaft and around the rim of the penile head during and after puberty. This is however normal, not to be confused with an STD.\nIn females, they appear predominantly in the labia minora.\nDiseases.\nSebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as oily skin, acne, and keratosis pilaris. In the skin pores, sebum and keratin can create a hyperkeratotic plug called a \"microcomedo\" which can block a pore and cause pimples. The prescription medicine isotretinoin significantly reduces the amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands, and is used to treat acne.\nThe extreme use (up to 10 times doctor-prescribed amounts) of anabolic steroids by bodybuilders, for muscle gain can also cause acne. The sebaceous gland is stimulated due to some steroid conversion into dihydrotestosterone. This event may cause serious acne on the face, neck, chest, back and shoulders.\nA blocked sebaceous gland can result in a sebaceous cyst.\nA condition involving enlarged sebaceous glands is known as sebaceous hyperplasia.\nSebaceous gland carcinoma is a very uncommon and aggressive form of cancer involving the sebaceous glands; sebaceous adenoma is a more benign neoplasm of the sebaceous glands.\nSebum can also build up around body piercings.\nImportance to other animals.\nCertain species of Demodex mites feed on sebum and are commonly found in the sebaceous glands of mammals, including those of humans.\nThe preputial glands of mice and rats are large modified sebaceous glands that produce pheromones."}

The study of microorganisms is called microbiology. \nMicro-organisms include bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists and viruses, and are among the earliest known life forms. The first of these four types of micro-organisms may either be free-living or parasitic. Viruses can only be parasitic, since they always reproduce inside other living things. \nMost micro-organisms are unicellular organisms with only one cell, but there are unicellular protists that are visible to the human eye, and some multicellular species are microscopic.\nMicro-organisms live almost everywhere on earth where there is liquid water, including hot springs on the ocean floor and deep inside rocks within the earth's crust. Such habitats are lived in by extremophiles.\nMicro-organisms are critical to nutrient recycling in ecosystems, because they act as decomposers. Because some micro-organisms can also take nitrogen out of the air, they are an important part of the nitrogen cycle. Pathogenic, or harmful, microbes can invade other organisms and cause disease.\nFree-living micro-organisms.\nFree-living microbes get their energy in many different ways. Some use photosynthesis, like plants do. Some break down natural chemicals in their environment. Others feed on things that were once living, such as fallen leaves and dead animals, causing them to breakdown or decay. Some fungi and bacteria cause food to decay. Moldy bread or fruit, sour milk, and rotten meat are examples of decayed food. In nature, decayed materials mix with soil, providing essential nutrients for plants to use. Without this process, the nutrients in the soil would run out. These types of organisms are called decomposers. They are the natural recyclers of living things on our planet.\nMicrobes also help us make some of our foods, such as bread, cheese, yogurt, beer, and wine. They feed on the sugar in grain, fruit, or milk, giving these foods a special texture and taste. \nParasitic microbes.\nSome microbes, often called germs, cause illness or disease. They are parasites which live by invading living things. Chickenpox, mumps, and measles are all caused by viruses. Some bacteria are also germs. They cause many infectious diseases including tuberculosis and tetanus. Certain bacteria cause tooth decay. It is possible to protect humans against some harmful microbes by storing and preparing food properly, cleaning the teeth, washing hands, and by avoiding close contact with ill people. \nComensalism.\nAll animals seem to have bacteria and protozoa living in or on them without doing much harm. Sometimes, as with herbivores, the microorganisms are vital to the digestion of food. The human gut has more organisms living inside it than there are cells in the human body."}

Despite its common name, it is more closely related to the mongoose family than to cats. A group of meerkats is called a \"mob\" or \"gang\", and usually all of the meerkats are relatives. \nHow meerkats act.\nMeerkats live in burrows in the ground. They are active during the day, except when hot during the afternoon sun. They also live in large family groups. The group is led by a female and a male. The meerkats are often all family. They get rid of fleas in each other's fur to become friends, which is called \"grooming\". Sometimes if a minor member is in trouble with the leader it will groom the leader to try and calm them down.\nThe meerkats help each other. When the family is eating or playing together, one meerkat acts as a sentry, and looks out for predators. If he or she sees one, then he gives a chirp and the group runs to a burrow to be safe. Also, when pups are looking for food, adults bring them food and teach them how to eat it. \nBefore pups start looking for food with the group, they are babysat by older members at the burrow to protect them from danger. Sometimes a female who never gave birth will produce milk for the pups.\nMeerkats can share their burrows with many different animals, such as other mongooses and sometimes squirrels who live on the ground. Sometimes even a snake will share the burrow with a meerkat. \nDespite the family bond of meerkats, sometimes a female might kill another female's pups. The leader might also kick out some females from the group. Males sometimes leave the group for a short time to look for females in other groups to mate with.\nMeerkats have many different chirps that they use for different reasons. They have a different chirp for being friends, anger, and for warning of an animal that will eat them.\nEating behavior.\nMeerkats eat mostly insects, but they also eat lizards, snakes, spiders, birds, plants, eggs and other small mammals.) Like all members of the mongoose family, meerkats cannot be hurt by some venoms, and they eat scorpions (including the stinger) and some snakes, without fear of illness, poison or death. They have no extra body fat, so they must look for food every day and eat food every day.\nWhen the meerkat group is eating, a guard will stand up and look for any animals that might eat its family. If the guard sees an animal, it gives a loud chirp and the family will run to a hole to be safe. Many animals eat meerkats. Most eagles, hawks, and falcons will eat them. Baby meerkats, called \"pups\" are sometimes also eaten by snakes. Jackals and other big animals that eat meat will sometimes eat meerkats.\nWhen pups are looking for food, they will cry loudly and an adult will come and feed them. At first the adult gives the pup a dead animal, then when the pup is older, the adult will bring a live animal but will hurt it so the pup can kill it easier. Then the adults start bringing live animals that are healthy, and when the pup gets the hang of eating these, the adults stop bringing food.\nThe meerkat body.\nThe meerkat weighs about one and a half pounds and the meerkat is ten to fourteen inches long. The meerkat uses its tail to balance because it stands up on its back legs to look for predators. Round the eyes are black patches which lessen the bright light that comes into its eyes. Meerkats have long claws that help them dig and fight. The back of the meerkat is furry and it has stripes to help it not be seen by predators. The front side is black and has no fur because it needs to get warm in the morning to be ready for the day.\nMeerkats also have ears that can open and close. They close in order to keep sand out when they are burrowing.\nHaving children.\nThe meerkat is old enough to have children at one year. Meerkats can have one to seven babies at one time. Four is the most common. Meerkats can give birth at any time of the year but like to give birth in spring and summer because there is more food. Female meerkats can have up to three litters in one year. When the babies are born they are pink and have no hair. Their eyes and ears are closed. When they are three weeks old, the mother allows them to get out of the burrow. By this time their eyes and ears have opened and they have light brown fur. The babies cannot be left alone so one of the other meerkats besides the mother stays behind to watch them.\nAfter the mother mates with the father, the babies develop for eleven weeks. Then she gives birth in a burrow. She feeds the babies milk until they start looking for food with the rest of the group, which is when they turn one month old. \nThe leader of the group is a girl and her mate is the male leader. This pair do not allow other minor members of their family to have babies. If a female does, then the leader kicks her out and sometimes the leader kills her grandchildren. Most of the meerkats in a group are either the leader's brothers and sisters or children. \nNew meerkat groups form when a female is kicked out and she teams up with a male and starts a new family."}

This helped confirm they belonged to the same group of theropod dinosaurs as \"Therizinosaurus\" and that therizinosaurs were, more specifically, advanced, herbivorous maniraptoran theropods.\nTheir fossils were first found in the late 1940s in Asia. They were named in 1954 after more bones were found. It was a thought to be a carnivore and herbivore; it had very long claws - they were about 3 ft long. \nPaleobiology.\nThe feeding habits of \"Therizinosaurus\" are unknown, since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate its diet. However, like other therizinosaurs, it was probably primarily herbivorous. \nThere are multiple possible functions that could have been served by the claws of \"Therizinosaurus\", such as defense against predators (e.g. the contemporary \"Tarbosaurus\") and in intraspecific fighting, such as fighting for territory or for mating, or to pull leafy tree branches towards its mouth.

That seemed fair as Edward was thought to be a very good Christian who died for his faith and it was thought that the murderers were \"irreligious\" men.\nMotive and details of his murder.\nEdward's stepmother, Queen Elfrida was against his accession to the throne as she wished her son, Ethelred, to become king instead. However, Edward was supported by more people - including St Dunstan - and was confirmed by the Witan.\nKing Edward was said to be \"a young man of great devotion and excellent conduct. He was completely Orthodox, good and of holy life. Moreover, he loved above all things God and the Church. He was generous to the poor, a haven to the good, a champion of the Faith of Christ, a vessel full of every virtuous grace.\"\nOn King Edward's accession to the throne, there was a great famine in the land and violent attacks were stirred up against monasteries by a prominent noblemen who wanted the lands which his father King Edgar had endowed to them. Many of these monasteries were destroyed, and the monks forced to flee. However, the King stood firm together with archbishop Dunstan to defend the Church and the monasteries. For this, some of the nobles decided to remove him and replace him with his younger brother Ethelred.\nOn March 18 978, the king was hunting with dogs and horsemen near Wareham in Dorset. Then he decided to visit his young brother Ethelred who was being brought up in the house of his mother Elfrida at Corfe Castle, near Wareham. He arrived alone at the castle. When still on his horse Elfrida offered Edward a glass of mead, and when he was drinking it, he was stabbed in the back by one of the queen's party. Ethelred himself was then only ten years old, so was not responsible for the murder. An other tale comes from Henry of Huntingdon who tells that Elfrida herself committed the murder:\n\"Edward was treasonably slain by his own family... it is reported that his stepmother, that is the mother of King Ethelred, stabbed him with a dagger while she was in the act of offering him a cup to drink.\"\nHistory of his relics.\nThe story of the relics of St Edward began at the moment of his death (martyrdom). Immediately following the murder, the body of the murdered king slipped from the saddle of his horse and was dragged with one foot in the stirrup until it fell into a stream at the base of the hill upon which Corfe Castle stands (From that time people thought that the stream had healing properties - particularly for the blind). The queen then ordered that the body be quickly hidden in a hut nearby. Within the hut however, there lived a woman blind from birth whom the queen supported out of charity. During the night, a wonderful light appeared and filled the whole hut and struck with awe, the woman cried out: \"Lord, have mercy!\" and suddenly received her sight. At this she discovered the dead body of the king. The church of St. Edward at Corfe Castle now stands on the site of this miracle. At dawn the queen learned of the miracle and was troubled and again ordered the disposal of the body, this time by burying it in a marshy place near Wareham. But a year after the murder a column of fire was seen over the place where the body was hidden, lighting up the whole area. This was seen by some of the inhabitants of Wareham, who raised the body. Immediately a clear spring of healing water sprang up in that place. Accompanied by what was now a huge crowd of mourners, the body was taken to the church of the Most Holy Mother of God in Wareham and buried at the east end of the church. This took place on February 13 980.\nBecause of a series of following miracles, the relics were brought to the abbey at Shaftesbury. When the relics were taken up from the grave, they were found to be whole and not destroyed. The transport of the relics was done in a great procession on February 13 981 and arrived at Shaftesbury seven days later. There the relics were received by the nuns of Shaftesbury Abbey and were buried with full royal honours on the north side of the altar. On the way from Wareham to Shaftesbury, a further miracle had also taken place; two crippled men were brought close to the bier and those carrying it lowered the body to their level, and the cripples regained full health at once. (This procession and these events were re-enacted 1000 years later in 1981). In 1001, the tomb in which the saint lay was said regularly to rise from the ground. King Ethelred was filled with joy at this and instructed the bishops to raise his brother's tomb from the ground and place it into a more fitting place. As the tomb was opened a wonderful fragrance issued from it - such that all present \"thought that they were standing in Paradise\". The bishops then took away the sacred relics from the tomb, and placed them in a casket in the holy place of the Saints together with other holy relics. This elevation of the relics of St. Edward took place on June 20 1001.\nSt. Edward was officially glorified by the All-English Council of 1008, presided over by St. Alphege, archbishop of Canterbury (who was later also martyred by the Danes in 1012). King Ethelred ordered that the saint's three feast days (March 18, February 13, and June 20) should be celebrated throughout England. Shaftesbury Abbey was rededicated to the Mother of God and St. Edward. Shaftesbury was apparently renamed \"Edwardstowe\", only reverting to its original name after the Reformation. Many miracles were recorded at the tomb of St. Edward, including the healing of lepers and the blind.\nDuring the sixteenth century, under King Henry VIII, monasteries were dissolved and many holy places were demolished, but St. Edward's remains were hidden so as to avoid desecration. In 1931, the relics were recovered by Mr. Wilson-Claridge during an archaeological excavation; their identity was confirmed by Dr. T.E.A. Stowell, an osteologist. In 1970, tests performed on the relics suggested that the young man had been knifed in the back whilst riding his horse and had then been dragged along the ground by the terrified animal with his foot caught in a stirrup. In about 1982, Mr. Wilson-Claridge donated the relics to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, which placed them in a church in Brookwood Cemetery, in Woking, Surrey. The St. Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well. The church is now named St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church. Orthodox Christians recognize Edward and other Westerners whose sainthood was declared before the formal split between Orthodox and Catholics in the 11th century."}

The series was created by \"Buffy\"'s creator Joss Whedon along with David Greenwalt. It first aired in October of 1999. Like \"Buffy\", it was produced by Whedon's production company, Mutant Enemy.\nThe series tells the story of the vampire Angel. Angel had his soul returned to him as punishment for killing a gypsy girl. This made him tormented by all the bad things he had done. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a private detective in a fiction version of Los Angeles, California. There, he and a variety of others work to \"help the helpless\" and \"save the souls\" of those who had lost their way. This usually meant fighting evil demons or humans that worked with demons (the law firm Wolfram and Hart). He also had to fight his own violent nature. (Not all \"demons\" in the \"Angel\" universe are evil beings.) The fifth season saw Angel taking over as the person in charge of the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart. This was done to try to fight evil from the inside.\nProduction.\nOrigins.\nSeveral years before the \"Angel\" first showed on television, writer Joss Whedon created the idea behind \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" to change the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie.\" Whedon was not happy with the way that the \"Buffy\" idea was first done in the 1992 movie, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". He was given the chance to do the story better with the television series of the same name. The early years of the series were about the life of Buffy Summers, a high-school aged vampire slayer, and her group of friends in Sunnydale (a fictional small town in California). The supernatural parts in the series took the place of the real problems that are a part of adolescence and young adulthood. The character Angel was first seen in the first episode. He became a regular cast member during the second/third seasons. In the fictional universe created by \"Buffy\" (the Buffyverse), Angel was born in 18th century Ireland. After being turned into a soulless immortal vampire, he became very well known for the evil things he did. Over 100 years later, Angel killed a gypsy girl. Her family punished him by returning his soul. He felt a very large amount of guilt for what he had done over all those years. Angel eventually began on a path of redemption. He hoped that he might make up for his past by doing good deeds. In the \"Buffy\" third season final episode, Angel leaves Sunnydale for Los Angeles to continue his path of redemption without Buffy. Whedon believed that \"Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was, a kind of superhero.\"\nWhile the main idea behind \"Buffy\" was \"High school as a horror movie\" in small-town America, Greenwalt and Whedon wanted to make \"Angel\" into a different \"gritty, urban show\".\nJoss Whedon and David Greenwalt created a short video, often called the \"Unaired Angel pilot\" for the WB Network. The idea for the series was a new version of the old detective genre.\nCancellation.\nOn Valentine's Day, 2004, the WB Network said that \"Angel\" would not be brought back for a sixth season. Joss Whedon posted a message on a popular fan site, The Bronze: Beta, in which he showed his surprise. He said he was \"heartbroken\". Fans created letter-writing campaigns and online petitions. They tried to get other networks, UPN mainly (the network that picked up \"Buffy\"), to pick up the show.\n\"Angel\"'s final episode, \"Not Fade Away\", aired on the WB May 19, 2004."}

{"id": "46180", "revid": "6864308", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46180", "title": "Canon (music)", "text": "A canon is a piece of voices (or instrumental parts) that sing or play the same music starting at different times. A round is a type of canon, but in a round each voice, when it finishes, can start at the beginning again so that the piece can go \u201cround and round\u201d. Perhaps the most well-known canon is the Pachelbel Canon written by Johann Pachelbel.\nDifferent types of canon.\nThere are different kinds of canon. Canons can be described according to distances between the entries of the voices. If the second voice starts one bar (one measure) after the first voice, this is called a \u201ccanon at the bar\u201d. If it starts after only half a bar, it is called a \u201ccanon at the half-bar\u201d. It is even possible to have very close canons, e.g. \u201ccanon at the quaver (eighth note)\u201d. Olivier Messiaen wrote a 3 part canon at the quaver in his \"\"' for violin and piano. The pianist\u2019s right hand (playing chords), his left hand and the violinist are the three parts.\nCanons can also be described according to the intervals between two voices. If one voice starts on a C and the next voice starts the same tune on an F above this is a \u201ccanon at the fourth\u201d (because the interval (distance) from C to F is called a \u201cperfect fourth\u201d). If the second voice has the tune upside down (inversion) this is called \u201ccanon in inversion\u201d. If the second voice has the tune at half the speed (each note being twice as long) this is a \u201ccanon in augmentation\u201d or an \u201caugmented canon\u201d. The opposite is a \u201ccanon in diminution\u201d.\n\u201cStrict canon\u201d means a canon where each voice imitates the first voice exactly all the way through the piece. If this does not happen (i.e. if it starts off as a canon but then becomes freer) it is \u201cfree canon\u201d. A canon may start off sounding like a fugue, but fugues have their own form and rules.\nCanons in the history of music.\nCanons were already popular in the 14th century when composers enjoyed writing music for several voices in which each voice has a share of melody (this is called polyphonic music.) Composers like Guillaume de Machaut wrote canonic music. His \"Sanz cuer m\u2019en vois\" is a three-part canon in which each part has different words.\nProbably the greatest writer of canons in the eighteenth century was Johann Sebastian Bach. Many of his organ works have canons. He wrote a famous set of \"Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"\" which have several canons at different intervals and inversions. He probably wrote this to show young composers how to write good canons. Bach also wrote a work called the \"Musical Offering\" which has what he calls a \u201ccanon per augmentationem contrario motu\u201d (canon in augmentation and contrary motion i.e. backwards) as well as a \u201ccanon per tonos\u201d. This last one is a modulating canon which means that the tune changes key. This is hard to compose well so that it sounds good because when the first voice has just changed key the other one is still catching up in the other key.\nBach was a great master at writing canons and other very complicated musical forms. After 1750 composers became less interested in writing music which was all polyphonic, although many composers still showed an interest in counterpoint. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote canons and even Romantic composers like Schumann and Brahms showed an interest. C\u00e9sar Franck wrote a canon for the fourth movement of his Sonata for Violin and Piano. It is quite easy to hear this canon, because the violin plays the tune an octave higher than the piano, and the piano holds on to a long note every other bar while the violin catches up.\nIn the 20th century composers such as Schoenberg who wrote serial music were fond of canons. Modern composers like Pierre Boulez have written rhythmic canons: canons in which, for example, the rhythm of one part is the retrograde (backwards) version of another."}

In this system, every kind of animal and plant is given a name consisting of two Latin words, for its genus and species. This became used by biologists all over the world, so he is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\". He was a good linguist, and famous in his time. He was made a noble by the Swedish king.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nCarl was born in Sweden. He was going to be a priest, but did not do well enough in school for that. Instead, Carl studied at a college for botany because he liked it. He studied in Lund and tried to improve the garden there. He later went to another college..\nTravels and research.\nIn 1735, Linnaeus moved to the Netherlands for three years. There, he earned his degree in medicine. He also published his book on plant classification. His book was called Systema Natur\u00e6. His book explained how to classify living things by putting them into groups. Some of these groups are bigger than others.\nLater he moved to Stockholm and practiced as a doctor. In 1739, Linnaeus married Sara Morea in Stockholm. Throughout the 1740s he conducted many field trips to places in Sweden to name plants and animals. When not on travels, Linnaeus worked on his classification, so it would work for plants, animals, and minerals.\nThe Swedish king Adolf Fredrik made Linnaeus a noble in 1757, and Linnaeus took the last name \"von Linn\u00e9\", later often signing just \"Carl Linn\u00e9\".\nLast years.\nAfter he was made a noble, he continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he talked with many different people. Linnaeus was upset by weak health, and he had gout and tooth aches. A stroke in 1774 weakened him, and two years later he had another, losing the use of his right side. He died on January 1778 and was buried in Uppsala cathedral.\nMankind.\nLinnaeus classified man as among the primates, which was already well understood by anthropologists like Blumenbach and natural historians like Buffon. It attracted the criticism of the Swedish church. The Lutheran Archbishop of Uppsala accused him of \"impiety\".\nLinnaeus recognised four races in the human species. These were European whites, American reds (Native Americans), Asian browns, and African blacks. Blumenbach's classification was similar, with the addition of a Mongolian (= Chinese) or yellow race. Thus recognition of man's position as a primate and the existence of races was quite widespread before the theory of evolution was formulated."}

A piece of music might, for example, be \"in the key of C major\" (meaning that it uses the notes of a C major scale, and the C sounds like the \"home key\" or \"tonic\" as it is called in music theory). Then it could modulate to G major so that the G now feels like the home key and the notes of a G major scale are used (the Fs will be F sharps).\nModulations like the one above are very common, because G is closely related to C (it is the 5th note in a C major scale: the \"dominant\"). A modulation to the subdominant (4th note of the scale) is also common (e.g. from C major to Fmajor). Music often modulates to the relative minor (e.g. C major to A minor).\nA modulation that goes to a key whose tonic is not part of the original key is called a \"chromatic modulation\". Modulating from C major to A flat major would be a chromatic modulation because A flat is not a note in the C major scale.\nMost pieces of music will modulate, especially if they are long pieces. It gives the music variety and helps to give it shape: the farther away from the tonic it goes the more tension there is.

It began 201.3 million years ago, and ended 145 million years ago. The Jurassic period happened between the Triassic and Cretaceous periods.\nClimate.\nDuring the Jurassic period, the climate was hotter and wetter than it is today. Carbon dioxide levels and sea levels were also higher than today. \nThe Kimmeridge Clay of the Upper Jurassic was laid down in an environment which does not exist on the earth today. Much of Western Europe was covered by a high sea level. The supercontinent Pangaea was beginning to break up, causing a narrow Atlantic Ocean. Because of this, the United Kingdom was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea, perhaps less than 100 metres deep, with occasional landmasses. \nThis was shallower water than the Blue Lias of the Lower Jurassic. It was often low in oxygen, which caused its organic material to decompose, but only partially. The Jurassic's mudstones are organic-rich, and gave rise to most of the North Sea oil.\nThe world of the Jurassic.\nPlate tectonics.\nThe Jurassic started with all the continents together, 201.3 million years ago (mya). This was the global supercontinent Pangaea. It ended about 145 mya. The boundary with the following Cretaceous period is not marked by any clear signs.\nThis is the only boundary between geological periods which has no clear markers.\nThe Jurassic happened in two parts. The first was marked by widespread oceanic anoxia, ocean acidification, and relatively high temperatures. This was likely caused by the eruptions in what we now call South Africa. Already, Pangaea was beginning to break up. From now on it was Laurasia to the north, and Gondwana to the south. The break-up of Pangaea took a long time to complete. The process of pulling apart in geology is called rifting. Floods of lava flowed from fissures (splits) and volcanos. \nBy the end of the Jurassic, South America had begun to part from Africa. In the western part of North America, mountain ranges began to form. This continued as the American tectonic plates gradually moved west. The westward-moving North American plates gradually rode over the Pacific Ocean plates to form the Rocky Mountains.\nPaleontology.\nOn sea and land, evolutionary trends which started in the Upper Triassic continued through the Jurassic. Archosaurian reptiles dominated the land biota. Reptile groups radiated and filled many niches. Dinosaurs, pterosaurs, marine reptiles (ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, turtles) all flourished. \nAmongst invertebrates, there was much change. Modern predators like starfish, crabs, and hole-boring gastropods took over the sea floor, eating the benthic fauna in huge numbers. Brachiopods gradually lost their grip on the in-shore habitats; molluscan bivalves took their place. \nEarly mammals existed, but mostly as small nocturnal creatures on the margins of the reptilian world. The first fossils of small dinosaurs with feathers, such as \"Anchiornis,\" come from the Jurassic period. The famous fossil bird, \"Archaeopteryx\", lived in the Upper Jurassic, though we now know it was not the ancestor of modern birds.\nLand plants.\nThe dominant land plants were the gymnosperms (conifers). Ferns, large horsetails,'monkey puzzle' trees, ginkgos and cycads were common. These trees were not easy to digest, compared to modern flowering plant trees (Angiosperms). They must have spent longer in the gut than the food of modern herbivores. That would make increased size an advantage for sauropods, which did indeed become much larger in the Jurassic than any any animal land life had before."}
{"id": "46202", "revid": "7880383", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46202", "title": "Triassic", "text": "The Triassic is the first geological period in the Mesozoic era and the seventh period of the Phanerozoic eon. It lasted 50.6 million years. The period began 251.9 million years ago, and ended 201.3 million years ago.\nThe period before the Triassic was the Permian period, the last period in the Palaeozoic era. The Jurassic period came after the Triassic.\nMany new groups arose during the Triassic period, including the dinosaurs and the first mammals.\nExtinction events.\nGreat extinction events happened at both the beginning and end of the Triassic period. The Triassic began after the great extinction at the end of the Palaeozoic era, the Permian/Triassic extinction event. Nobody really knows the exact cause of the Permian/Triassic extinction, but many experts have different theories. Generally, experts agree that many things caused the extinction.\nThe Triassic had several more extinction events, whose causes are also unknown. The most significant of these took place at the end of the Triassic, which was one of the 'big five' Phanerozoic marine extinctions.\nGeology.\nName.\nThe name 'Triassic' comes from the three rock strata that formed during the Triassic period (\"tri\" means \"three\"). Three layers of rock strata formed during this period:\nOverall climate.\nOn average, the Triassic's climate was very different from today's:\nPaleogeography.\nDuring the Triassic period, there were no separate continents like there are today. Almost all the Earth's land mass was together in a single supercontinent called Pangaea (\"all the land\"). Pangaea was centered more or less on the equator. All the deep-ocean sediments (the things that settled at the bottom of the ocean) had disappeared. This happened because oceanic plates moved sideways and downward until they were finally on top of each other, or under each other.\nThe supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic \u2013 especially late in the period \u2013 but had not yet separated into different continents.\nBeing a super-continental land mass, Pangaea had limited shoreline. Because of this, Triassic marine deposits fossils from Triassic ocean life are rare in most of the world. In North America, for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. However, they are common in Western Europe, where the Triassic was first studied.\nMajor adaptive radiations.\nThe first part of the Triassic had much less variety than the Permian, and showed signs of a deteriorated environment. This situation lasted for about 5 million years, then steadily improved. Into the vacant ecological niches, new forms evolved, replacing old with new. This rapid adaptive radiation happened to the reptiles on land, the fish in the seas, and a number of other groups, like the insects. Diverse communities with complex ecology took 30 million years to re-establish.\nFish.\nThe group of bony fish known as the teleosts first appeared during the Triassic period. The group now includes over 80% of all fish and 95% of all bony fish. The only other common group of fish are the Chondrichthyes (the sharks and rays). The rays also appeared during the Triassic.\nReptiles.\nMany reptile groups first appeared during the Triassic period, possibly because so many niches were vacant at the time. Some of these new groups died out in the End\u2013Triassic extinction event, but those that survived ruled the Earth for the rest of the Mesozoic. Examples include:\nThis was a major change, because in the middle Triassic period, the Synapsids (mammals' ancestors) were still dominant.\nThe end-Triassic extinction.\nMany reptile groups became extinct during the Triassic, including:p.\u00a041\nAlso, amongst the Synapsids (which used to be called mammal-like reptiles), the Dicynodonts died out during the end-Triassic extinction.p.\u00a041\nThe Triassic was a period of great change in tetrapods: many new and important groups appeared, but many others became extinct. Of all the periods in the Mesozoic era, there are the least number of fossils from the Triassic period. This makes it difficult for scientists to explain these events."}

To play a chromatic scale on the piano every note is played: both white and black notes (e.g. C, C sharp, D, D sharp, E, F etc.). A chromatic scale can start on any note.\nMeaning of the word \u201cchromatic\u201d.\nThe word \u201cchromatic\u201d comes from the Greek word \u201cchromos\u201d meaning \u201ccolor\u201d. Organists in the 16th and 17th centuries such as Sweelinck liked to write \u201cChromatic Fantasias\u201d. These were pieces based on tunes which were chromatic. In those days, because of the tuning systems used, not all the semitones were exactly the same size. Going up a chromatic scale would have been like walking up a staircase with steps which were slightly larger or smaller in depth. This made chromatic scales very interesting and \u201ccolourful\u201d which is why they were called \u201cchromatic\u201d.\nChromatic harmony.\nChromatic harmony means harmony (chords) which use notes which do not belong to the key the music is in (they are not in the key signature). Although Bach in the 18th century used chromatic harmony it was the 19th century composers who used it more and more. Wagner wrote music which was very chromatic: there were lots of sharps and flats and it kept modulating to different key areas. The chord at the beginning of his opera \"Tristan and Isolde\" is so famous that it is known as the \"Tristan chord\". It is very chromatic. The music is full of tension because it leaves us wondering which key the music is in."}

It follows an orphaned ninja who dreams to become \"Hokage\". The Hokage is the strongest ninja and the leader for the village, called Konoha (meaning \"leaf\" in Japanese). As the series progresses, Naruto and his friends begin to solve the ancient history of the ninja world. His friends including Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Their teacher is Kakashi Hatake. The manga was first published in 1999 in a Japanese magazine called \"Shonen Jump\". It was also translated into English. The anime series premiered in Japan in October 2002. In the United States, it started in September 2005.\nPlot.\nTwelve years ago, a spiritual Nine-Tail fox attacked the Hidden Leaf Village, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki sacrificed themselves to seal the monster within a boy named Naruto. Nobody told Naruto that the fox was sealed inside him. The villagers treated him badly because of the monster. When Naruto found out the truth, it made him want to become the next Hokage and earn everyone's respect. After graduating from being a genin, Naruto joined Team 7. The members of Team 7 were Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno and their teacher Kakashi Hatake. They defeated Zabuza and Haku in the Land of Waves. Orochimaru interrupted the Chunin Exam, killing the Third Hokage and Fourth Kazekage. Orochimaru tricked the army of the Hidden Sand into opposing the Leaf. Jiraiya trained Naruto, while Tsunade became the Fifth Hokage. Sasuke left the village and looked for revenge against Itachi. Naruto defeated five enemies from the Land of Sound through the forest, but he failed to stop Sasuke from joining up with Orochimaru.\nTwo and a half years later, Naruto recruited Sai and Yamato. The Akatsuki organization started kidnapping ninja hosts. Sasuke formed a tracking party and defeated Itachi. Then he became stronger and joined Akatsuki. Naruto learned Sage Mode. He defeated Nagato for killing Jiraiya and devastating the village, even though he became good. Tobi interrupted the meeting and declared the Fourth Great Ninja War. He had a plan to reform the legendary Ten Tails from the nine tailed beasts. That would control humanity and achieve world peace. After learning Chakra Mode with the fox spirit, Naruto helped the Allied Shinobi Forces defeat the army of White Zetsu. Tobi was revealed to be Obito, who kept the power of the eyes containing the Rinnegan and Sharingan. \nWhen Madara came back to life and stole Obito's half of the power, he turned into the Sage of Six Paths. He used the power of the forbidden art to trap everyone in the Ninja World (except Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi, Obito and other dead ninjas). Black Zetsu fused with Madara to complete the reincarnation. That freed Kaguya Otsutsuki to take his place. In the past, Kaguya's son, Hagoromo, had trained Ashura and Indra. Ashura and Indra were the first incarnations who came before Naruto and Sasuke. After Kaguya killed Obito, Kakashi sacrificed his power. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to seal Kaguya and Zetsu, and Madara died again. When Sasuke used the forbidden genjutsu, Naruto defeated and spared him. The world was peaceful and all the spiritual beasts were freed from Kaguya. Kakashi became Sixth Hokage. Sasuke realized his mistake, disabled the genjutsu, and forgave everyone.\nYears later, Naruto became the Seventh Hokage. He married Hinata Huyga. They had two children. Their daughter was named Himawari, and their son was named Boruto. Boruto has a special eye and body mark. Boruto makes a new Team 7 with Konohamaru Sarutobi, Sasuke and Sakura's daughter Sarada, and Orochimaru's artificial son Mitsuki. Boruto helped Naruto and Sasuke defeat the two clansmen.

Orochimaru joined the Akatsuki and worked with Danzo. Orochimaru wanted to live forever so he could learn every jutsu. He did experiments on other ninja. Then he made his own ninja village, the Hidden Sound Village. He used the village to experiment on people and make an army. He wanted to use the army to destroy Konoha. To live forever, he changes his mind to different bodies every few years. He wanted to use Sasuke's body to live in. After the end of part II, Orochimaru stopped fighting Konoha. He made Mitsuki instead. Yamato watched him.\nKabuto Yakushi.\nOrochimaru's right hand and spy. He is good at medical ninjutsu and can manipulate cells. Kabuto was initially a Foundation spy. He had no memory of his past. Orochimaru helped Kabuto when Danzo did not trust him. Kabuto used his skills to spy on people for Orochimaru.

He was Kisame's partner..\nAkatsuki.\nThe main enemy of the second part of the series. It was founded by Jiraiya's students Yahiko, Nagato and Konan as a peacekeeping group in the Hidden Rain. Danzo and Tobi made it change to paid fighters made of rogue ninja. Nagato became a leader. The Akatsuki's new goal was to make everyone understand suffering so that there would be peace. They acted on Madara's Project Moon's Eye to feed the tailed beasts to the Gedo Statue. They used an Infinite Tsukiyomi to control all people.\nObito Uchiha.\nAlso known a Tobi. He is the Akatsuki's true leader. He is the main enemy for most of Part II. He was a child during the Third Great Ninja War. He gave his left eye to his teammate Kakashi when he looke like he was about to ddie.When he looked like he was going to diee, Obito was saved by Madara.

Madara tried to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village with the Nine Tails jutsu. Hashirama stopped him, and Madara faked his death. Madara used Hashirama's blood for his Rinnegan. He summoned the Gedo statue to keep himself alive. He finally died after getting Obito Uchiha to work for him. He gave his Rinnegan to Nagato so that he could be brought back from the dead later. After some time, Madara came back from the dead and turned himself into the Ten Tails jinchuriki. He tried to finish his plan, but Black Zetsu betrayed him. Madara became a vessel for Kaguya.

He was the King of Wessex but assumed the title King of the Anglo-Saxons. He was king from 899 until his death in 924. \nAtheling.\nEdward was the son of Alfred the Great and Ealhswith. She was a daughter of Ethelred, also called Mucill, of the Gaini. He was born about the year 870. As one of at least three , it was not absolutely certain he would be king after his father. His cousin, Aethelwold, was older and was the son of Alfred's older brother Athelred of Wessex. When he was about four years old Edward was sent to Rome. There, in a ceremony, he was given a sword, belt and given the rank of . This is one of several things Alfred did to make Edward the first choice among the Athelings who would succeed him as king. By a past agreement Alfred had control of most of the royal estates. He could leave all or some to Edward. In the 880s, Alfred made a will giving most of the royal estates to his son Edward, and left his two nephews only modest lands in the eastern part of the realm. This meant that if Ethelhelm were selected as king over Edward, he might not have enough income to support himself as king.\nKing of Wessex.\nEdward ruled from time of his father's death on 26 October, 899. But he wasn't until (8 June) of 900. His reign began with his cousin Athelwold, son of King Athelred, seizing the royal manors of Wimborne and Christchurch. When Edward confronted him Athelwold fled. He left behind a nun he had abducted. Athelwold was accepted by the Danes of Northumbria. There he was elected King of York. In 901 Athelwold was in Essex with a fleet he raised over seas. In 902 he convinced a Danish army in East Anglia to raid into Wessex and Mercia with him. In response Edward led his army into East Anglia and destroyed the countryside. Edward ordered his troops to retire back to Wessex, but the Kentish men disobeyed his orders and stayed behind. The Danish army quickly caught up with them. In the battle that followed, Ethelwald was killed. \nEdward continued his wars against the Danes. He received a great deal of aid from his sister, Ethelflaeda. She had married Ethelred of Mercia and at his death she became the leader of the Mercians. Together Edward and Ethelflaeda defeated the Danes in numerous battles. But Ethelflaeda also built a line of fortresses on the Mercian Frontier. This was what her father Alfred the Great had done on the Wessex borders with the Danish held territories. Edward began to use these fortresses differently. Not just for defense of his own lands he used them to hold captured lands. Edward and his sister were very successful against the Danes. So much so they quit raiding into Wessex and Mercia. Freed of wars with the Daneds, Edward could attend to other issues. He brought Strathclyde and parts of Northumbria under his control. He also brought Mercia under his direct rule after his sister Ethelflaeda died. The appearance of the Viking leader Ragnvald in York slowed his progress. But by the end of his reign he had control of all lands south of the River Humber. In a treaty Ragnvald, the kings of Strathclyde and the Scots recognized his rule.\nIn 924 Mercian nobles wanting to be free of Edward's rule made an alliance with the Welsh. Edward quickly put down the and placed a in the town of Chester. But this expedition proved to be his last. Edward died 17 July 924.

The beak is used for eating, fighting, grooming, and many other things. \nBeaks on different types of birds can be very different in size, shape and color. Beaks are made of an upper and lower mandible. In most species, two holes are used for breathing.\nParts.\nThe upper and lower parts of the beak are called mandibles. They are attached to the skull. The upper mandible is attached using several smaller bones, and is able to move up.\nThe mandibles are bones that are covered in a rhamphotheca - a thin layer of hard skin. This hard skin is similar to horns, nails, and claws, and grows constantly. In some birds the rhamphotheca has different colors in different times of year. Beaks can have color spots that can be seen in ultraviolet light. \nThe edges of the mandibles are used for cutting and grabbing food. Some birds have sharp points or grooves on the edge of the beak. These shapes make it easier to hold insects or break seeds. Birds that hunt fish or other animals often have more sharp points. \nThe gape is the inside of the open mouth of a bird. Baby birds of some species have bright colors in their gape, including spots that can be seen in ultraviolet light. Parent birds use these colored spots to choose which baby to feed. The color spots go away as the babies grow.\nThe nostrils are the two breathing holes on the beak. They are usually on the top mandible on the part close to the head. A few species breathe through their mouths and have no nostrils. In some birds the nostrils cannot be seen because they are under feathers or a cover called an operculum.\nSome birds like parrots, raptors, and turkeys have a cere - a waxy area covering the beak near the head. Most species that have a cere have their nostrils in it. Male and female birds in some species are told apart by the color of their cere. \nDucks, geese, and swans have a special plate at the end of the beak called a nail. The nail is hard and is used to force out food that is stuck to a surface or in the ground. \nThe egg tooth is a small, hard lump that grows on the tip of baby bird beaks. It grows before they hatch and falls off soon after. Birds use the egg tooth to break open the egg from the inside. Only a few species of birds kick the inside of the egg to hatch instead of using an egg tooth.\nUse.\nA bird is able to stab or bite with its beak. Birds also use their beaks as a threat when afraid or angry, by opening them wide. Sometimes birds hiss or clap their beaks at the same time. \nBeaks are used for preening (grooming the feathers). A bird can comb its feathers with its beak to adjust any that are badly positioned. Many birds spread a thin layer of oil onto their feathers, which helps to waterproof them. They also remove any dirt or parasites at the same time. \nMany birds use beaks during courtship. They may dance, touch each other's beaks, or tap things with their beaks. In some species, birds may preen each other as either a friendship behavior or courting behavior. \nBirds lose body heat through their beaks because beaks have blood in them and are not covered with feathers. Birds in warm places can lose heat this way without sweating and losing water. Birds in cold climates have smaller beaks to stop too much heat loss. "}

They live in colonies.\nAll the polyps in a colony are zooids: they are all clones, genetically identical. Inside the colony they breed by asexual reproduction. They also reproduce sexually. Colonies of the same species release gametes together, over one, two or three nights around a full moon.\nEach coral animal is like a small bag. The opening on top is the mouth. Tentacles (little arms) around the mouth carry stinging nematocysts, which paralyse the small animals eaten by the coral polyps.\nCoral usually grows in tropical oceans. A few corals grow in cold water, like the oceans around the British Isles and Norway.\nSymbiosis.\nMost corals get energy and nutrients from symbiosis with photosynthetic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae. Such corals need sunlight and grow in clear, shallow water, typically at depths less than 60 metres (200\u00a0ft).\nMany corals (and some other cnidaria) live with zooxanthellae of the genus \"Symbiodinium\", which are dinoflagellates. Usually, each polyp harbours one species of algae. By photosynthesis, these provide energy for the coral, and help calcification.\nThe algae benefit from a safe place to live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, the coral often ejects the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration. Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress\u2014they can regain algae, possibly of a different species, at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.\nCoral reefs.\nA coral reef is a place where many corals grow. The reef makes good places for many other animals, such as fish, crabs, clams, and sponges.\nEach coral animal secretes calcium carbonate around itself. This makes the solid structure of the colony. When the animal dies, new polyps live on top of the older structure. The rock they make is also called coral.\nThey are called \"coral skeletons\". Each different kind of coral colony builds a different kind of skeleton, so that colonies can be shaped like a brain, a mushroom, a cabbage, or many other things. With all these corals gathered together building skeletons around themselves, large coral formations are made. Together, all the coral formations in one place make up a coral reef.\nCoral can also be used as jewellery."}

Edgar was a popular choice among the English, because he was English and a grandson of Edmund Ironside. \nEdgar was born in Hungary because his father was in exile there. When Edgar was five, his father, Edward the Exile returned to England from Hungary. He had been exiled from England during the Viking reign. Soon after returning, Edgar\u2019s father died under mysterious circumstances.\nKingship of England.\nEdward the Confessor, who had no children, had promised the throne to his nephew Edward the Exile, his nearest living relative. In 1057, the king's messengers found Edward The Exile, his wife Agatha, their two daughters and son Edgar living in Hungary. Edward agreed to return to England and brought his family. But a few days after their arrival Edward was killed. At the time Edgar was only five years old. When Edward the Confessor died Edgar was still young (15 years old) and had no experience, money or soldiers. The leaders in England expected attacks from Norway and Normandy. Under these conditions, Edgar was not a good choice as king. Royal succession in Anglo-Saxon England was determined by the Witenagemot (Witan), a council of wise men.\nWhile Edgar was an Etheling (a prince of the royal family) he was not the heir apparent. That designation was unknown in Anglo-Saxon England. A king could recommend his successor but the actual choice of King was made by the Witan. The first thing the Witan did was choose Edward's brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson to be the next king. On the same day Edward, the Confessor was buried, Harold Godwinson was hurriedly crowned king at Westminster Abbey.\nNine months later, on 14 October 1066 at the battle of Hastings Harold was killed. Duke William rested his army for five days before marching to London. During this time Edgar was selected as king in London. It was thought a second army could be raised to fight the Normans if they had a king whose name could unite England. But William took control of England with his army before Edgar could be crowned. William met with the English leaders including Edgar, at Berkhamsted. There William received oaths of fealty and received hostages from Edgar.\nAfter the Norman Invasion.\nSix months after Berkhamsted, King William returned to Normandy. To make things easier for his representatives left to govern England, he took Edgar and others with him. At the end of 1067 William brought Edgar back to England when he returned. In the summer of 1068 Edgar took his mother and sisters and escaped to Scotland. His sister, Margaret, married King Malcolm III of Scotland. Along with Malcolm, Edgar took part in several military campaigns against William, now King of England. He later took part in the Crusades. Edgar remained unmarried and never produced any children. He lived until c.1126 (Aged 75). Edgar was the last living male member of the Anglo-Saxon royalty.\nAncestry.\nEdgar was a direct descendant of a line of Wessex kings that the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" traced back to the dynasty's supposed 6th century founder, Cerdic, a descent that includes Alfred the Great. His grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather were all Kings of England before Cnut the Great took the crown."}

They are one of the two groups which evolved from egg-laying amniotes in the first part of the Carboniferous period.\nThe synapsids are the other group which evolved from amniotes. They gave rise, eventually, to the mammals.\nLiving sauropsids include lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, and birds. Extinct sauropsids include non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and many others.\nOrigin of tetrapods.\nMore or less, the evolution of tetrapods has taken this course:\nThe earlies tetrapods lived in water. Clear fossil tetrapod tracks from the mid-Devonian predate previous tetrapod records by 18 million years.\nNine genera of Devonian tetrapods have been described. These earliest tetrapods were not terrestrial. They lived in swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons, brackish river deltas, and even shallow marine sediments.\nRomer's gap.\nBetween the lobe-finned fish tetrapods and the first amphibia and amniotes in the Middle Carboniferous lies a gap of 30 million years, with few satisfactory tetrapod fossils. This, noted in 1950, is Romer's gap. Some new fossils were found in the 1990s, such as \"Pederpes\", right in the middle of the Romer Gap. The gap still obscures the details of the tetrapod transition.\nSometime, in the later Devonian or earliest Carboniferous, the fishapods became mainly land-based. One group of them kept their link to the water, and always laid their eggs in water. They became the amphibians. The others evolved a way of laying eggs on land. They were the amniotes, whose key innovation was the cleidoic egg.\nSometime in the middle or lower Carboniferous, the amniotes split into two lines. One line lead to the reptiles of all kinds, and we call that the Sauropsida. The other line led eventually to the mammals, and we call that the Synapsida. It is not right to say \"mammals evolved from reptiles\" because both groups derived from early amniotes. In any event, modern reptiles are vastly different from modern mammals. Both groups have evolved for over 300 million years from the early amniotes."}

Chun was later pardoned by President Kim Young-sam on the advice of then President-elect Kim Dae-jung, who was sentenced to death by Chun some 20 years earlier.\nThe road to power.\nChun was a graduate of the Korean Military Academy in 1955. He was a member of Hanahoi, a powerful group of military officials that supported his actions. He was in charge of the investigation into the assassination of President Park Chung-hee. On 12 December 1979, in what became known as the Incident of December 12th, Chun ordered the arrest of Army Chief of Staff General Chung Sung Hwa (\uc815\uc2b9\ud654, \u912d\u6607\u548c) without authorization from then-President Choi Kyu-ha. He ordered the arrest as part of the investigation of his part in the assassination. Chung Sung Hwa resisted the arrest. This led to a bloody gun fight at the Army Headquarters and the Ministry of Defense. By the next morning, Chun and his fellow military academy graduates Roh Tae-woo and Jeong Ho-yong were in charge of the Korean military.\nOn 17 May 1980, Chun placed the entire country under martial law and disbanded the National Assembly. Many politicians were arrested, including liberal politician Kim Dae-jung. Kim was later sentenced to death in spite of protests from the United States. Later, Chun changed Kim's sentence in return for U.S. support. Protests across the nation became smaller. However, very violent prostests happened in Gwangju. Protestors Lootinglooted government building. They armed themselves with stolen guns and military jeeps. Protestors killed a couple of policemen and started of violent protest against the government. A couple of hundreds of protestors and some thirty soldiers were killed in the Gwangju. Choi resigned in August, and Chun was elected his successor by the National Conference for Unification, the South Korean electoral college, in September. In February 1981, Chun was elected president under a revised constitution as the candidate of the Democratic Justice Party (later renamed Democratic Republican Party). \nYears in office.\nChun ruled in an authoritarian manner. The 1981 constitution was less authoritarian than its 1972 predecessor, the Yushin Constitution, but still granted very broad powers to the president. However, it limited the president to one seven-year term. Chun did not try to change it so he could run for reelection in 1988. \nBy 1986, the general public was happy with the economic growth. However, there was much anger and hatred against Chun's regime by left-wing students who later became known as 386s. The left wing students led the nationwide June 1987 protests. In the same month, U.S. President Ronald Reagan sent a letter to Chun in support of the creation of \"democratic institutions.\" On June 29th, Roh Tae-woo announced a program of reform. This included direct presidential elections, restoration of banned politicians including Kim Dae-jung, and other liberalizing measures. This won Roh instant popularity, and he was elected as the next president of South Korea. It later became known that Chun was responsible for this plan.\nDuring Chun's visit to Rangoon, Burma (now Myanmar) in 1983, a bomb exploded at a mausoleum he was about to visit. The bomb killed 21 people, including South Korean Cabinet members. Chun himself did not die because he got there two minutes late.

He was named one of the top 100 Asians of the Century by Time Magazine (1999). He has been severely criticized for his government's brutality, especially after 1971. A penname was Jungsu(\uc911\uc218;\u4e2d\u6a39).\nBirth.\nPak was born in Seonsan, a small town in Gumi-si(\uad6c\ubbf8\uc2dc), Gyeongsangbuk-do(\uacbd\uc0c1\ubd81\ub3c4) near Daegu(\ub300\uad6c). He was the seventh child from a family of modest means. His father was Park Seong-bin (age 46 at the time) and his mother was Baek Nam-hui (age 45).\nPak came from an undistinguished local branch of Goryeong Bak descent group.\nPak won admission to Daegu Teacher's College through a competitive examination. He entered on April 8, 1932 and graduated on March 25, 1937, after five years of study. His formative years coincided with the Japanese invasion of China, starting with the Manchurian incident in 1931 and culminating in all-out war in 1937.\nHe went on to teach for several years in Mungyeong, where the school has been preserved as a museum.\nMilitary career.\nPak won admission to a two-year training program in Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria. Under the Japanese policy of s\u014dshi-kaimei, he adopted the Japanese-style name Takaki Masao (\u9ad8\u6728\u6b63\u96c4). He graduated from the Japanese Manchurian military academy at the top of his class in 1944. He then was selected for another two years of training at the Imperial Military Academy in Tokyo.\nPak had served as a lieutenant in the Kantogun, part of the Imperial Japanese Army, in Manchuria, fighting Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist forces. Although the Kantogun also carried out actions against Korean guerrillas, it's improbable that Pak participated in such action since there were no Korean guerrillas in the region at the time of his brief deployment.\nPost World War II.\nIn the aftermath of Japan's defeat in World War II, under his communist elder brother's influence, Pak joined a communist group, the South Korean Workers' Party, in the American occupation zone, which later became South Korea. Pak was involved in a rebellion in Yeosu and Suncheon, Jeollanam-do, led by units of the new American-supported army. Pak was arrested and sentenced to death, but released soon after revealing the names of communist participants to the South Korean authorities. He was then released and left the army in dishonor. However; the outbreak of the Korean War enabled him to be reinstated, and he served the new country fighting against the communists.\nAscension to presidency.\nSyngman Rhee, the first president of the Republic of (South) Korea, was forced out of office on April 26, 1960 as an aftermath of the April 19 Movement, a student-led uprising. A new government took office on August 13. This was a short-lived period of parliamentary rule in South Korea with a figurehead president, Yun Po-son, in response to the authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Rhee administration. Real power rested with Prime Minister Chang Myon.\nYun and Chang did not command the respect of the majority of the Democratic Party. They could not agree on the composition of the cabinet and Chang attempted to hold the tenuous coalition together by reshuffling cabinet positions three times within five months.\nPolitical background.\nMeanwhile, the new government was caught between an economy that was suffering from a decade of mismanagement and corruption by the Rhee presidency and the students who had led to Rhee's ouster. The students were regularly filling the streets, making numerous and wide-ranging demands for political and economic reforms. Law and order could not be maintained because the police, long an instrument of the Rhee government, were demoralized and had been completely discredited by the public. Continued factional wrangling caused the public to turn away from the party.\nCoup d'\u00e9tat.\nSeizing the moment, then-Major General Pak Ch\u014fng H\u016di led a bloodless military coup (called the 5.16 Revolution) on May 16, 1961, a coup largely welcomed by a general populace exhausted by political chaos. Although Chang resisted the coup efforts, President Yun sided with the junta and persuaded the United States Eighth Army and the commanders of various South Korean army units not to interfere with the new rulers.\nThe Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) was created on June 19, 1961 to prevent a countercoup and to suppress all potential enemies domestic and international. It was to have not only investigative power, but also the power to arrest and detain anyone suspected of wrongdoing or harboring anti-junta sentiments. The KCIA extended its power to economic and foreign affairs under its first director, Colonel (retired) Kim Jong-pil, a relative of Pak and one of the original planners of the coup.\nYun remained in office to provide legitimacy to the regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. Pak Ch\u014fng H\u016di was the real power as chairman of the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction. Following pressure from the Kennedy administration in the United States, a civilian government was restored, with Pak narrowly winning the 1963 election as the candidate of the newly created Democratic Republican Party over Yun, candidate of the Civil Rule Party. He was re-elected in 1967, again defeating Yun by a narrow margin.\nFirst two terms as president.\nEconomic reform.\nPak is generally credited as playing a pivotal role in the development of South Korea's economy by shifting its focus to export-oriented industrialization. When he came to power in 1961, South Korean per capita income was only USD 72, and North Korea was regarded as the greater economic and military power on the peninsula because North Korea was industrialized under the Japanese r\u00e9gime due to its geographical proximity to Manchuria and merit in terms of natural resources, and managed to rebuild after heavy bombing by the Americans during the Korean War. During Pak's tenure, per capita income increased twentyfold, and South Korea's rural, undeveloped economy was transformed into an industrial powerhouse. Even Kim Tae Jung, one of Pak's most prominent opponents during his rule, has retrospectively praised him for his role in creating the modern-day South Korea.\nThe strength of Pak's leadership was evidenced by the remarkable development of industries and rise in the standard of living of average South Korean citizens during his presidency. Many still question Pak's judgment, however, as his 1965 normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan had been extremely unpopular and resulted in widespread unrest as memories from Japan's 35-year brutal colonization of Korea proved vivid. However, by normalizing relations with Japan, Pak allowed Japanese capital to flow into the country. These aids and loans\u2014although criticized by many Koreans to be too meager for the 35 years of occupation by Imperial Japan\u2014along with American aid, helped to restore the depleted capital of South Korea. Nonetheless, it must be noted that with North Korea's economy at the time being bigger and more vibrant than that of South Korea, Pak did not have many options or much time to negotiate for more fitting reparations and apologies. This issue still plagues Japan and South Korea's relationship today.\nPak was reelected in 1967 against Yun.\nYusin Constitution.\nThe Constitution of 1963 barred a South Korean president from seeking a third consecutive term. However, with the assistance of the KCIA, Pak's allies in the legislature succeeded in amending the Constitution to allow the current president\u2014himself\u2014to run for three consecutive terms. In 1971, Pak was victorious again, this time over Kim Dae-jung in the general election.\nJust after being sworn in for his third term, Pak declared a state of emergency \"based on the dangerous realities of the international situation.\" In October 1972, he dissolved Parliament and suspended the Constitution. In December, a new constitution, the Yusin Constitution, was approved easily by the general public. The new document dramatically increased Pak's power. It transferred the election of the president to an electoral college, the National Conference for Unification. The presidential term was increased to six years, with no limits on reelection. In effect, the constitution converted Pak's presidency into a legal dictatorship. Pak was re-elected in 1972 and 1978 with no opposition.\nAssassination attempts.\nOn January 21, 1968, a team of about 10\u201415 North Korean spies was secretly sent to South Korea to kill Pak. They crossed the border mountains and hijacked a bus in Seoul. No civilians were in the bus. The spies drove it towards the Blue House (the presidential residence of South Korea), where Pak was at the time. When the Korean military was informed of the presence of the North Koreans, they hurriedly went to protect the president. Armed with machine guns and grenades, the spies drove almost to the Blue House until they met South Korean soldiers. After a short grenade and gun battle, all but one spy were killed. Thirty-seven South Koreans were also killed.\nOn August 15, 1974, a botched assassination attempt by North Korean agent Mun Se-gwang claimed his wife, Yuk Yeong-su, instead. After this attack he finished the speech he had been giving. His wife died later that day.\nAssassination.\nOn October 26, 1979, Pak was gunned down by Kim Jae-kyu, the director of the KCIA. Kim claimed that Pak was an obstacle to democracy and that his act was one of patriotism. After Kim shot the president to death and the leader of his guards, his agents quickly killed four more of the presidential bodyguards before the group was apprehended. The entire episode is usually either considered a spontaneous act of passion by an individual and that the actions of the other agents only occurred because the men felt loyalty to Kim and naturally followed his lead, or as part of a pre-arranged attempted coup by the intelligence service, , with the latter being more widely believed.\nLegacy.\nIt is alleged by supporters that despite his dictatorial rule and the high growth that occurred during his years in power, Pak did not engage in corruption and led a simple life. Detractors allege he was simply a brutal dictator and only brought about high growth through military control over labour.\nBeing a complex man as a policy maker, many Koreans continue to hold Pak in high regard in great part due to the industrial and economic growth experienced by South Korea under his presidency. But there are also many who condemn Pak for the brutality of his dictatorship and for his service to the Japanese army during World War II. Today, Pak's critics deplore the widespread human rights abuses in South Korea during his rule. However, his supporters argue that the human rights abuse accusation is mostly fabricated or exaggerated. One example of his many abuses was the kidnapping of opposition activist Kim Tae Jung. Around noon of August 8, 1973, Kim was attended a meeting with the leader of the Democratic Unification Party held in the Room 2212 of the Hotel Grand Palace in Tokyo. At around 13:19, Kim was abducted by a group of unidentified agents as he walked out of the room after the meeting. He was then taken into the empty Room 2210 where he was drugged and became unconscious. Later Kim was moved to Osaka and later to Seoul, South Korea. Kim was later quoted as saying that a weight had been attached to his feet aboard the boat heading toward Korea, indicating that the kidnappers had intended to drown Kim by throwing him into the sea. They were, however, forced to abandon this plan as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force began a pursuit of the kidnappers' boat. Subsequently Kim was released in Busan. He was found alive at his house in Seoul five days after the kidnapping. According to some reports U.S. Ambassador Philip Habib intervened with the South Korean government to save Kim's life.\nPak's daughter Park Geun-hye was elected the chairwoman of the conservative Grand National Party in 2004. She has resigned her post in order to prepare a presidential bid for the upcoming election. \nFamily.\nPark Chung-hee was married three times. first wife Kim Ho-nam (\uae40\ud638\ub0a8; 1918 - 1990, m.1936 - 1945), birth one daughter, Park Jae-ok(\ubc15\uc7ac\uc625, b.1937). second wife Lee Hyon-lan (\uc774\ud604\ub780; ? -?, m.1945 - 1947), birth one son, early death(b.1947 and d.1947). three wife Yuk Young-soo(\uc721\uc601\uc218, 1926 - 1974, m.1950 - 1974, her death), birth daughter Park Geun-hye(\ubc15\uadfc\ud61c, b.1952) and Park Geun-ryoung(\ubc15\uadfc\ub839, b.1954), son Park Chi-man(\ubc15\uc9c0\ub9cc, b.1958)."}

He entered politics after Japanese occupation ended in 1945, with Syngman Rhee being his mentor. In 1948, Yun was made mayor of Seoul by Rhee. A year later, he was made the Minister of Commerce and Industry. Soon, he started to disagree with Rhee's authoritarian policies. He then served as president of the Red Cross Society, before being elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he founded the opposition Democratic Party along with several others.\nAfter Rhee's government was ousted by a student-led pro-democracy uprising, Yun was elected president on August 13, 1960. He was merely a figurehead, as South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system in response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhee's regime. After Park Chung Hee's coup in 1961, he stayed on briefly to provide legitimacy to the regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. He opposed Park's authoritarian rule and ran for president twice in 1963 and 1967, losing each time. After receiving suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities, Yun retired from politics in 1980 and focused primarily on cultural activities until his death from diabetes and high blood pressure. He died in 1990."}

He was the first president of South Korea. His presidency, from August 1948 to April 1960, remains controversial, affected by Cold War tensions on the Korean peninsula and elsewhere. Rhee was a strong anti-Communist, and led South Korea through the Korean War. His presidency ended in resignation following popular protests against a disputed election. He died in exile in Hawaii.\nEarly life.\nRhee was born in Whanghai Province to Rhee Kyong-sun, a member of the aristocratic Yangban family. Rhee was descended from Prince Hyo-nyong, the second son of King Taejong of Joseon. He soon became active in Korea's struggle against Japanese control. He was arrested in 1897 for demonstrating against the monarchy. \nAfter he was released in 1904 he went to the United States. He obtained several degrees, including a Ph.D. from Princeton University. He began writing his name in the Western manner, with the personal name before the family name. When President Theodore Roosevelt was helping negotiations for the Treaty of Portsmouth, Rhee asked him to put freedom for Korea in the treaty. This did not happen. \nIn 1910, he went back to Korea under Japanese rule. His political actions got him into trouble with the Japanese army, so he left for China in 1912. In 1919, all of the major pro-independence groups formed the provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai. Rhee was elected the president, a post he held until 1925 when he was removed by the Provisional Assembly for the misuse of his authority.\nPresidency.\nPresidenty of South Korea.\nAt the end of World War 2, Rhee returned to Seoul. This was before the other independence leaders, since he was the only one well known to the Allies. In 1945, he was chosen as head of a provisional (short term) government. With the unspoken agreement of the occupation authorities, Rhee conducted a number of actions to \"remove Communism\". This was actually a hidden plan to remove all possible opposition to him.\nRhee was elected the first president of South Korea on 10 May, 1948 by a parliamentary vote. He defeated Kim Koo, the last president of the Provisional Government by 180 votes to 16. All the left-wing parties refused to take part in the election. On 15 August 1948, he formally took over from the US military and became the legal power over the Korean people. \nAs president, Rhee took on dictatorial powers even before the Korean War started in 1950. He allowed the internal security force (headed by his right-hand man, Kim Chang-ryong) to put people in prison and torture them if they were thought to be Communists or North Korean agents. His government also directed several massacres, the most famous being on the island of Jeju. This was after an uprising by left-wing groups. While massacres did occur under governments that came after Rhee, there were not as many and less widespread. \nKorean war.\nRhee made himself unpopular by telling the people in Seoul to stay in the city when the Korean War started. He had already left. His decision to cut the bridges on the Han River stopped thousands of people from escaping from the Communists. The UN and South Korean forces fought back and drove the North Koreans north towards the Yalu River. After a Chinese counterattack they UN and South Korean were pushed back to the current DMZ. Rhee became unpopular with the US and the UN for refusing to agree to a number of peace plans that would have left Korea divided. He wanted to become the leader of a united Korea with UN assistance. He tried to stop any peace plan that would not remove the northern government completely. He also argued for stronger military action to be used against China. He was annoyed because the US would not bomb China.\nOn January 18, 1952, Rhee declared South Korean rule over the waters around the Korean peninsula. This was an idea the same as today's exclusive economic zones. The new border, which Rhee called the \"Peace Line\", included Tsushima Island and the uninhabited islands named Dokdo. This led to protests from the Japanese government. They claimed that the islands were Japanese territory. Minor clashes followed, but the islands have been under South Korean administration since then.\nThroughout his rule, Rhee took extra steps to keep his control over the government. In May 1952 Rhee pushed through constitutional changes which made the presidency a directly-elected position. To get this passed by parliament he declared martial law. He jailed the members of parliament he thought would vote against it. Rhee was soon elected by a big majority. He regained control of parliament in the 1954 elections. He pushed through an amendment to exempt himself from the eight-year limit on presidents.\nRhee's chances for reelection during the presidential campaign of 1956 seemed small. People did not think he should be allowed to be President three times. The main opposition candidate Shin Ik-hee drew large crowds during his campaign. Shin's sudden death during the campaign, however, allowed Rhee to win the presidency with ease. The runner-up of that election, Cho Bong-am of the Progressive Party, was later charged with spying and executed in 1959.\nResignation.\nBy 1960, Rhee had already served three terms in office. His next victory was certain after the main opposition candidate, Cho Byeong-ok, died shortly before the March 15 elections. Rhee won with 90% of the vote. The real contest was in the race for vice president. This was held separately under the law of the time. Yi Gi-bung, who Rhee thought should take over after him, was declared the winner of an election that the opposition claimed was rigged. This created anger among groups of the Korean people. A student-led April 19 Movement forced Rhee to resign on April 26. \nOn April 28, a DC-4 belonging to the CIA operated Civil Air Transport took Rhee out of South Korea. This was to rescue him from the angry crowds. Kim Yong Kap, Rhee's Deputy Minister of Finance, revealed that President Rhee had taken $20 million in government money for himself. Rhee, his Austrian-born wife, Francisca Donner, and adopted son lived in exile in Honolulu, Hawaii. On July 19, 1965, Rhee died of a stroke. His body was returned to Seoul and buried in the National Cemetery on July 27, 1965.\nLegacy.\nRhee's legacy has been in considerable dispute. In general, conservative circles regard Rhee as the patriarch of the nation, while liberals tend to be critical of him.\nRhee's former residence in Seoul, Ihwajang, is currently used for the presidential memorial museum, and Woo-Nam Presidential Preservation Foundation has been set up to honour his legacy."}

They must have loved others and loved God. In the Catholic Church, at least two miracles by the saint's intercession must be proven. This means that, because the person is believed to be in heaven, someone must pray, or ask, for the saint to pray for them in heaven. If the prayer is answered and a miracle happens, then they know that the person is a saint. The miracles prove that the saint must be in heaven with God, and able to ask God for prayers to be answered. \nThese people then enter into the canon, or list, of saints.\nIt is not correct to say that the Church \"makes\" someone a saint. The Catholic Church believes that anyone who is in heaven is already a saint. The canonisation process just finds out for sure, or without a doubt, that someone is a saint."}

It was published in 1847 in England. It is Charlotte Bront\u00eb's most famous book.\nBackground.\nAround this time, Charlotte was beginning to suffer a painful toothache, which made many of her teeth fall out. She was even more worried about her father's blindness. On 19 August 1846, Charlotte went to Manchester with her father to see an eye surgeon, William James Wilson. Wilson performed the operation on 25 August. The next day, Charlotte described it to her friend Ellen in a letter. Wilson had been helped by two other surgeons. The operation had taken about 15 minutes. Charlotte wrote, \"Papa is now confined to his bed in a dark room and is not to be stirred for four days - He is to speak and to be spoken to as little as possible\". \"Depressed and weary (tired)\", Charlotte began writing \"Jane Eyre\".\nCharlotte did not have good eyes, so she wrote in little square books that she held close to her eyes. She wrote the first copy in pencil. When she left Manchester to go back home, she took the book with her and continued writing.\nPlot.\n\"Jane Eyre\" is a love story. It tells about a young woman called Jane Eyre who was an orphan and goes to teach a girl named Adele Varens in a far-away house. The master of the house is Mr. Rochester. Jane and Mr. Rochester fall in love, but Jane is horrified when she finds out Mr. Rochester is already married to a crazy woman. She leaves the house, believing that marrying him would now be the same as adultery and that she would be his mistress, not his wife. When she goes away, she becomes sick and almost dies. Three people, Diana, Mary, and St. John Rivers, find her and let her live with them. There, she becomes a teacher and finds out that they are her cousins. She is very happy until St. John wants her to marry him and be a missionary with him. She knows that he does not really love her and thinks she is simply useful, so she says no. However, he continues to ask her, and she is finally almost persuaded that it is her duty to marry him when she hears Mr. Rochester crying, \"Jane! Jane!\" She feels that something has happened to him, and quickly goes back to see him. His crazy wife had set his house on fire and died in it. Mr. Rochester, because of the fire, had become blind and wounded. Jane, now that his wife is dead, is happy to marry him, and they get married and have a son.\nFamous sentence.\nThe novel begins the last chapter with one of the most famous lines in English literature:\n\"Reader, I married him\".\nThe active voice was revolutionary for its time."}

The Roman emperor Hadrian built the wall to control barbarians: the ancient Britons to the north of the wall. The wall is now in England, and runs between the Solway Firth and the River Tyne in northern England. When the Romans built the wall, it was the northern border of the Roman Empire. \nThe Roman legions (armies) of the governor of Roman Britain, Platorius Nepos, built the wall for the emperor between 122 and 126. The wall was about long. Most of the wall \u2013 \u2013 was made of stone. To the west of this section \u2013 for \u2013 the wall was made of turf. The stone part of the wall was thick and about tall. The wall's turf part was thick and about tall. To start with, the wall's east end was at Newcastle upon Tyne (), but later the Romans built more stone wall for to the east, to Wallsend on Tyne. In front of the wall (on the northern side) was a ditch. The ditch was away from the wall. The ditch was at about deep and was normally about wide. The Romans used the wall for at least two hundred years.\nHadrian's Wall is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Frontiers of the Roman Empire. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It shares this listing with the Antonine Wall in Scotland and the German fortifications known as the \"Limes Germanicus\". Hadrian's Wall was the first of two \"great walls\" created by the Romans in Great Britain. Its ruins are more visible than the lesser known Antonine Wall to the north.\nThe Vallum is a huge earthwork associated with Hadrian's Wall. It runs from coast to coast to the south of the wall.\nConstruction.\nBegun in AD 122, during the rule of the emperor Hadrian, it was the first of two fortifications built across Great Britain. The second was the Antonine Wall (now in Scotland), the lesser known of the two.\nThe original wall was 20 feet tall and 8 feet wide. It had a fort every 7 miles that housed a force of over 500 soldiers and for each mile there were smaller forts and watchtowers. There were three legions working on it and in 10 years it was nearly finished. \nThe wall was the most heavily fortified border in the Empire. In addition to its role as a military fortification, it is thought that many of the gates through the wall would have served as customs posts to allow trade and levy taxation.\nTourism.\nA significant portion of the wall still exists, particularly the midsection, and for much of its length the wall can be followed on foot by Hadrian's Wall Path or by cycle on National Cycle Route 72.\n\"Stretching for 73 miles across northern England, Hadrian's Wall is the most important monument of Roman Britain, and the best-known frontier of the entire Roman empire\".English Heritage describes it as \"one of the towering achievements of military engineering, and a monument to the power of one of the greatest empires in world history\"."}

It has about 69 100 inhabitants and is 65,24\u00a0km\u00b2. \nHistory.\nThe area of Suwa\u0142ki has had people living on it since the early Middle Ages. However, with the coming of the Teutonic Order to Sudovia, their lands were captured and did not have many people living on it. The village was founded by monks, who were given the area around the future city in 1667 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania John II Casimir. Soon after the group of monks built its headquarters in Wigry, where a monastery and a church were built. The new owners of the area started fast use and building of the forests and brought enough settlers to build new villages in the area. Also, production of wood, lumber, tar and iron ore was started.\nThe town was cut into into 300 lots for future houses and its people were all given civil rights and did not have taxes for seven years. The town was also given 18.03 square kilometres of forest that was to be made into land to grow crops on. On May 2, 1720, by King August II let the city keep its rights, and the town was allowed to have one fair a week and four markets a year. A coat of arms was given also, with Saint Roch and Saint Romuald on it.\nIn 1794 the area was taken by Prussia. In 1796 the monastery in Wigry was closed and the ground that it was on was taken by the Prussian government. The next year local authorities were moved to the town, as well as a group of soldiers. By the end of 18th century, Suwa\u0142ki had 1,184 people and 216 houses. Many of them were Jewish.\nIn 1807 Suwa\u0142ki was taken by the Duchy of Warsaw. After losing Napoleon Bonaparte and the Congress of Vienna, the area was taken by Poland. The title of a powiat capital was gone for a short time, but it got the title back on January 16, 1816, when August\u00f3w Voivodeship was made and its police were slowly moved to Suwa\u0142ki. Soon after the old city hall was destroyed and replaced with a new one, and General J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105czek paid for paving all the city's streets. Also, the graveyard was moved from the town centre to the edge of the town, and the area was made into a romantic city park. Also, a new road connecting Warsaw with St. Petersburg was built.\nNew streets were paved and new buildings were opened. In 1820 a new church was built and the following year the first synagogue opened. In 1829 a permanent post office was opened in Suwa\u0142ki. Between 1806 and 1827 the number of people living in the town grew and reached 3,753 people living in 357 houses. In the November Uprising of 1831 the people living in the town took part in the fights against Russia, but the city was taken by the Russian army on February 11. In 1835 Tsar Nicholas I decided not to move the capital to August\u00f3w and the fate of Suwa\u0142ki was sealed. Two years later the town became the capital of August\u00f3w Gubernia.\nIn 1826 new buildings were started by the state police. In 1835 a police station was finished, in 1844 a new town hall was finished, and Orthodox and Protestant churches. Soon after a new marketplace was opened, and St. Peter's and Paul's hospital and a gymnasium. Between 1840 and 1849 the main Catholic church was re-done Polish architects of the era, including Piotr Aigner, Antoni Corazzi and Henryk Marconi. In 1847 the city council passed a law banning building of new wooden houses.\nThe number of people living in the city kept growing quickly. In 1857 it had 11,273 people and in 1872 it had almost 20,000 people. New factories needed workers they came from all over the world. Because of that, the Polish-Jewish people was joined by people of many types of people that worshipped in the Russian Empire. Soon the city became the fourth biggest town in the Kingdom of Poland. After the January Uprising of 1863, a new a kind of government was made to join all of the Polish lands with Russia. In 1866 the gubernia of August\u00f3w was named Suwa\u0142ki Gubernia. However, the new Warsaw-Petersburg railroad passed by Suwa\u0142ki and the town's growth ended.\nAfter the spring of 1905, the time of Polish cultural re-building started. Although the Polish language was still kept from use, Polish schools and a library were opened. After the Great War broke out, there were fights for the area. In 1915, Suwa\u0142ki was in German control. The town and nearby areas were broken from the rest of the Poland and were ruled by a German commander. Laws made by the German command led to the making of many secret social groups. In 1917, local branches of the Polska Organizacja Wojskowa were made.\nAfter the end of the Central Powers in November 1918, the commander signed an agreement with the Temporary Council of the Suwa\u0142ki Region and let the city back into Poland. However, the German army stayed in the city. In February 1919 the local people voted in the first elections to the Polish Sejm, but soon after the German commanders changed their minds and kept the Polish soldiers from the area and in May passed it to Lithuania to control. By the end of July the Paris Peace Conference gave the city to Poland and the Lithuanians left the city, but some of the Polish lands were left on the Lithuanian side of the border while several Lithuanian villages were left on the Polish side of the border. This led to the Sejny Uprising on August 23, 1919. To make the city safe, the next day Polish soldiers entered Suwa\u0142ki. There was a Polish-Lithuanian War and for several days limited fights were fought for the control over Suwa\u0142ki, Sejny and other towns in that area. The war ended because of the Entente in mid-September. During the Polish-Bolshevik War the city was captured by the Reds and after the Battle of Warsaw it was again given to the Lithuanians, but it was taken by the Polish Army with few losses soon after.\nDuring the time between the wars, Suwa\u0142ki ruled itself. This led to another time of growth, with the number of people in the city rising from 16,780 in 1921 to almost 25,000 in 1935. Most of the money in the city was made from trade during this time. Also, in 1931 the new water works and a power plant were built.\nIn the later times of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 the town was shortly captured by the Red Army. However, on October 12 of the same year the Soviets quit and gave the area to the Germans, because of the Nazi-Soviet Alliance. The town was named Sudauen and was made a part of the German Reich's East Prussia. Laws and terror led to the making of some rebellion groups. Although most of them were destroyed by the Gestapo, by 1942 the area had one of the strongest ZWZ and AK networks. Almost all of the city's once 7,000-strong Jewish people were murdered in German concentration camps. On October 23, 1944, the city was captured by the Soviet 3rd Belarusian Front. The fights for the city lasted for a few days and killed almost 5,000 Soviet soldiers. \nAfter the war, Suwa\u0142ki was still a capital of the powiat. The heavily-damaged town recovered very slowly and Communism did not help the city's problems. This time came to an end in 1975, when Suwa\u0142ki became the capital of a separate Suwa\u0142ki Voivodeship. The number of people rose quickly and by the end of the 1970s there were over 36,000 people in the city.\nIn 1989 the city had a time of trouble. Most of the city's factories did not work good enough and ran out of money. However, the making of the Suwa\u0142ki Special Economic Zone and the place of the Russian and Lithuanian borders opened new chances for local trade. Also, the clean city started to bring many tourists from all around the world to the city."}

They may be designed to burn with colored flames and sparks. Displays are common throughout the world and are a main point of many different cultural and religious festivals. Independence Day, New Year's Eve and Guy Fawkes Night are examples.\nSome fireworks are ground-based, and others are shot into the air. Because they explode and can cause fires or burns, most countries have laws that only allow trained professionals to use display fireworks. Smaller, less explosive fireworks are available to regular, everyday people, but they are still dangerous and cause injuries each year.\nHistory.\nFireworks dates back to the 7th century and originated in China. The Chinese developed many different kinds of fireworks with a variety of effects and color. The art and science of firework making developed into an independent profession.

In 1110, a large fireworks display in a martial demonstration was held to entertain Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100-1125) and his court.

It was created on 23 May 1863. Many people think that the SPD is one of the two most important political parties in modern-day Germany, with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\nHistory.\nIt was founded as the General German Workers Association (\"Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein\") (ADAV) on May 23rd in 1863 in Leipzig. Founder was Ferdinand Lassalle.\nIn 1875 the ADAV joined with the Social Democratic Workers' Party (\"Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei\") (SDAP), which was founded in 1869 in Eisenach by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht.\nThe new name was the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\") (SAP).\nIn the autumn of 1890 it took its present name.\nIn the years between 1875 and 1890 it was made illegal by Otto von Bismarck.\nThe Social democrats wanted to support the rights of workers.\nIn 1914 the SPD was split into two. Most members of the party supported the Kaiser and his plans for war. The other members formed the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (\"Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschland\") (USPD). They were against the war.\nAfter the monarchy fell, the SPD led some governments of the Weimar Republic.\nLater the SPD was the only party in the Reichstag who voted against the Enabling Act,(\"Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz\") which allowed Hitler to become dictator.\nAfterwards, the Nazis banned the SPD and arrested the leading Social Democrats. Many were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Others moved away to towns where they were not known. Friedrich Kellner, an organizer for the SPD in Mainz from 1920 to 1932, moved to Laubach. He wrote entries in a secret diary about the crimes of the Nazis.\nAfter World War II, the SPD was reformed.\nIn the GDR (East Germany) the Soviet Union forced the SPD to join with the communist party to make the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei\"). In Western Germany the SPD continued as the largest center-left party.\nFirst chief of the SPD after WWII was Kurt Schumacher.\nThe SPD led some state governments in West Germany, but was always the leading opposition party in the Bundestag (federal parliament).\nUnder its parliamentary party leader Herbert Wehner the SPD joined the federal government led by chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU) with the CDU and the CSU in 1966. Party chief Willy Brandt became foreign secretary and vice chancellor.\nIn 1969 Willy Brandt became federal chancellor. The SPD lead a coalition government with the FDP as its partner. In 1974 Helmut Schmidt became chancellor.\nIn 1982 the SPD lost the power of government.\nBetween 1998 and 2005 the SPD led the government under chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Its partner this time was The Greens.\nIn November 2005 the SPD became the junior partner in a coalition with the CDU and CSU under Angela Merkel.\nPrograms.\nThe SPD is traditionally the party of the workers in Germany.\nIn 1959 the SPD adopted the \"Godesberger Programm\", named after the town of Bad Godesburg in North Rhine-Westphalia. The SPD formally abandoned Marxism, and accepted the market economy (which means people and companies can make money and keep it themselves), but wanted to have a social balance (which means people would get help from the government if they had no job, were sick or too old to work, instead of relying on savings or charity). Companies might get subsidies to help keep people in work.\nMany people thought that the government of Chancellor Schr\u00f6der (1998 - 2005) changed the idea of social balance, making people rely more on savings or charity. The SPD lost a lot of members. Now there is a discussion in the SPD about new social balance policies."}

If pensions are part of a system of social security, the recipient of the pension is usually retired or disabled. They either have worked a long time during their life, or they are physically unable to do so. A pension is usually paid until a certain date (or event) occurs. In the case of social security plans, pensions are usually linked to the life of the person who receives the pension. \nA defined Benefit pension defines the benefit to the worker based on salary basis, years worked, and a multiplier. An example might be 2@55 final 3, meaning that the annuity is the highest 3-year average salary times years worked times 2% (if age 55). A worker with 30 years service would receive 2*30 or 60% of their salary. Some systems allow a worker to receive more than 100% salary by various maneuvers to alter the final salary basis.\nA defined Contribution pension defines the contribution, without constraining or promising a certain benefit.

While Hasidim study the same books of Torah as the rest of Judaism, they focus on learning the hidden aspects of the text as well. Hasidic study also includes many of the teachings of Kabbalah.\nHasidism has strict laws about physical contact between the genders, Hasidic men will not even shake hands or make any physical contact with unrelated members of the opposite gender and Hasidic women will not make any physical contact with unrelated members of the opposite gender and also limit conversation. \nLeadership.\nEach Hasidic group has a leader who is called the Rebbe (Rabbi). The Rebbe is a man who is a Rabbi and is chosen by the Hasidim to be their leader. Some of the jobs that he does are giving lectures on Torah and Hassidic-matters and taking part in the different events of his Hasidim, like weddings and Brit milahs.\nHasidic Groups.\nThere are hundreds of different Hasidic groups.

It was made by Alyssa \"Lissa\" Daniels (born 1986) in 1998.\nHistory.\nHow \"Lissa Explains\" Began.\nLissa did not plan on teaching HTML at first. She was an 11 year old girl who wanted to make a website but had problems remembering the HTML codes. She saved the codes on a webpage. Many people who saw her website asked her how she made it. Lissa gave them the address (URL) to the webpage she put the codes on. As more and more people went on the page, Lissa added more codes and information, and made the URL it became public.\nChanges.\nA year later, so many people went on \"Lissa Explains\" that Lissa decided she needed a domain name for her website. She bought the domain name, lissaexplains.com. The website name was changed to \"Lissa Explains it All\". Soon, even more people went on \"Lissa Explains\", and her web hosters told Lissa that she would have to buy a plan that costed $100 a month. Lissa was upset because her parents would not pay so much money for her website.\n\"Lissa Explains\" was a popular website that had a lot of visitors, so Lissa filled out many forms at agencies. The agency would pay her money to put their advertisements on her website, \"Lissa Explains\". The money she made paid for her web hosting and other services on her website. The company that hosts \"Lissa Explains\" now is Dreamhost.\nNow, with even more visitors, Lissa had to change the layout and design of her website again. She got rid of a lot of the pictures on her website to save money and bandwidth space. It changed from this to this, the way it looks right now.\nProblems.\nLissa's website was the first website that taught children HTML. Many people know about it, and it is being copied. For example, Lissaexplainsitall.com has a URL that is almost the same as \"Lissa Explains\", and it also has something to do with web design and HTML.\nServices.\nOther than teaching HTML, Lissa Explains also has other services. Lissa teaches HTML, JavaScript, CSS, how to use frames and tables, and how to make a trailing cursor.\nLissaMail.\nIn April 2008 the website for LissaMail expired, leading to the conclusion that this service is no longer being provided.\nPostcards.\nLissa has postcards that users can send to their friends. \nColor Tools.\nLissa's Color Slider lets users choose a color in the shade they want and get the hexadecimal color code for it. She also has a color wheel for people who have Internet Explorer. \nHTML Editor.\nLissa's HTML Editor converts and changes formatted text into HTML codes.\nMeta Tag Generator.\nAt Lissa's Meta Tag generator, users can get the HTML code to make META tags."}

He served under President Richard Nixon. He was also the 55th governor of the state of Maryland and the first Greek American governor and vice president in United States history.\nHe is most famous for his resignation in the fall of 1973 after he was under investigation for the crimes of extortion, tax fraud, bribery, and conspiracy. In October he was charged for taking taken bribes of more than $100,000 during his vice presidential term.\nAgnew is the only U.S. vice president in history to leave office because of criminal charges. Ten years later, in January 1983, he paid the state of Maryland almost $270,000 as a result of a civil suit that came from the bribery allegations. He was only the second vice president to resign the office (John C. Calhoun had been the first).\nHe wrote two memoirs later in his life. He defended his corrupt actions in both memoirs.\nEarly life.\nSpiro Agnew was born in Baltimore, in the state of Maryland. His father was Theodore Spiros Agnew, a Greek immigrant who shortened his name from Anagnostopoulos when he moved to the USA (which was between 1897 and 1902), who married Margaret Akers, a native of Virginia. He joined the US Army and served in both World War II and the Korean War.\nCareer.\nAfter holding a number of political offices in Baltimore, he ran for Baltimore County Executive in 1962. In a race that was thought to go to the Democratic Party Agnew surprisingly won. While executive he was known for outlawing racial segregation. He ran for Governor in 1966. His opponent was George Mahoney, who ran on a racist and pro segregationist platform. Agnew won after many Democrats voted for him. While governor he passed tax reform, justice reform, anti pollution laws, and civil rights laws. He also took a tough stand against the black power movement, and this angered many civil rights leaders who had supported him.\nAgnew was chosen as Richard Nixon's running mate in 1968. Nixon wanted to do better in the Southern States. Agnew, a moderate, also could get Democrats to vote for him. He was chosen as vice presidential candidate at the convention over George Romney. Agnew supported \"law and order\" a policy of enforcing the law strictly. Agnew took a hard stand against the anti-war movement. His sometimes dirty attacks led him to be called Nixon's \"hatchet man\". However he did speak out against the Kent State Shooting, where national guard troops shot protestors to death in Ohio.\nAgnew enjoyed the privileges of being vice president. He was well liked by Nixon supporters, and made it onto the Republican national ticket again in 1972. But in 1973, it became clear that Agnew had been very corrupt in his career as governor and was facing several felony charges. He cut a plea deal and narrowly got out of having to serve a long time in prison. \nResignation, disgrace, and death.\nHe resigned in disgrace in October 1973, and never spoke to Richard Nixon again (Nixon would himself resign in 1974 over a similar scandal). Agnew became a disgraced figure and never was very much involved in politics after that. His portrait was taken down in the Maryland Governor's Mansion and his bust was not put up as a former vice president. When both were put on display, many criticized the decision to display them. He died in 1996 of leukemia. He was not given a state funeral of any kind and had a small funeral service. He was buried at a cemetery in Maryland.\nElectoral history.\nBaltimore County Executive, 1962\nGovernor of Maryland, 1966\n1968 Republican National Convention (Vice Presidential tally)\nUnited States presidential election, 1968\n1972 Republican National Convention (Vice Presidential tally)\nUnited States presidential election, 1972\nDeath.\nAgnew died of leukemia in Berlin, Maryland."}

This is the usual meaning of the word \u201cpart\u201d when talking about musical compositions. \nWhen a group of instruments are all playing the same notes together - like the first violins in an orchestra, they are all playing the same part. The second violins are playing another part, the violas are playing yet another part, etc.\nIn a string quartet each of the four instruments plays a different part.\nA group of singers who are all singing the tune together are singing in \"unison\". If they divide into soprano, alto, tenor and bass, they are singing in four parts. The sopranos may be singing the tune and the altos, tenors and basses are providing the harmony underneath. This is called \u201c4 part harmony\u201d. If each of the four parts has its own share of the melody (or its own melody) it is polyphonic music. Polyphonic music is always in several parts.\nSometimes music for the piano or organ may be written in a strict number of parts, e.g. a 5 part fugue for the piano could also be performed on five different instruments because there are always exactly five different lines of music (although sometimes a part will have a rest, but this is always shown by rests in the music). Although written on two staves for the pianist (or three staves for an organist) it could be written on five staves: one stave for each part.\nAnother word for a musical \"part\" is \"voice\". In most other European languages the word for \"part\" in this musical sense is the same as the normal word for \"voice\" e.g. in German: \"Stimme\" or French \"voix\".\nIn general, the more parts there are in a musical composition the harder it is to compose because they all have to fit together to sound nice. The 16th century composer Thomas Tallis wrote a motet called \"Spem in alium\" which is in 40 parts. A choir of at least 40 people is needed to sing it, and even then each person will be singing something different to all the others.\nOrchestral parts.\nA slightly different (but related) meaning of \u201cpart\u201d can be the actual printed music that a player in an orchestra or band puts on the music stand to play from. The oboe part, for example, will just have the notes that the oboe plays. In contrast, the conductor has a musical score in which all the instrumental parts are written underneath one another.\n\u201dPart\u201d meaning \u201csection\u201d.\nThe word \"part\" can also be used in its normal meaning of \"section\" (i.e. a bit of something). We can say: \u201cthe first part of the movement is played just by the woodwind instruments\u201d. \nSometimes a large work like an oratorio will be split into two or three \u201cParts\u201d (in opera these would be called \u201cActs\u201d)."}
{"id": "46732", "revid": "1136992", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46732", "title": "Videocassette recorder", "text": "Videocassette recorder (VCR) is an electronic device that records and plays videotapes. Most use VHS or Beta cassettes that contain recordings of movies and other programs (such as music videos, exercise videos, and so on). To watch a recording using a VCR, the VCR has to be connected to a television set.\nVCRs at first were mainly used to record programs from television broadcasts. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many people used VCRs to record their favorite television shows to watch them later. This was called time-shifting.\nWatching movies.\nIn the mid-1980s, VCRs became a very popular way for people to watch movies and other recorded programs on their home television. Until the 21st century, video rental stores offered a large selection of movies recorded on VHS tapes that customers could rent. In the 1980s, some video rental stores also offered a smaller number of movies recorded on Beta tapes.\nVHS vs Betamax.\nIn the 1980s, VHS was involved in a format war with Sony's Betamax. VHS won the format war. Betacam, a variant of Betamax designed specifically for professional camcorders, did become popular in television studios, but consumers used VHS at home.\nIn 1974, the Japanese government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) tried to force the Japanese video industry to agree on just one home video recording format, in order to avoid consumer confusion. Later, Sony built a prototype of a Betamax VTR. Sony presented the prototype to MITI, and convinced them to use Betamax as the technical standard. Sony was then allowed to charge other companies licensing fees to use the Betamax technical standard, so that they could also build and sell Betamax machines.\nJVC believed that an open standard (a technical standard that is open and free for anyone to use) like VHS was better for the consumer, so they fought against the MITI and Sony. JVC attempted to convince other companies, including Matsushita, to use VHS instead of Betamax. Matsushita agreed with JVC because Matsushita worried that Sony might become the most powerful company in the video recording industry if the Betamax format was the only one that the MITI allowed them to sell. Matsushita also disliked the fact that Betamax systems could only record one hour of video.\nBecause Matsushita agreed with JVC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, and Sharp began to support the VHS technical standard. When Sony released its Betamax machines in Japan in 1975, it pressured the MITI to support Sony even more. However, the combination of JVC and the other companies was much stronger, and eventually the MITI stopped trying to create a single technical standard for the whole industry. JVC released the first VHS machines in Japan in late 1976, and then in the United States in early 1977. Sony continued to sell Betamax machines, and they competed with VHS throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s.\nIn countries that use the NTSC technical standard for television broadcasting, the Beta I version of Betamax was able to record one hour of video at a tape speed of 1.5\u00a0inches per second\u00a0(ips), which was similar to a VHS standard-play mode (SP). Originally, VHS recorded two hours of video at 1.31\u00a0ips. Betamax's smaller-sized cassettes were not able to contain as much magnetic tape as VHS cassettes. They could not compete fit longer lengths of tape into the cassettes to match VHS's two-hour recording time. Instead, Sony had to slow the tape speed down to 0.787\u00a0ips (Beta II) in order to reach two hours of video recording in the same cassette size. This meant that the television picture produced by a Betamax tape was worse than VHS when comparing two-hour recordings. Sony eventually released a longer Betamax cassette called Beta III which allowed NTSC Betamax to record more than two hours, but by then VHS had already won the format war.\nVHS also used a less complicated set of mechanisms to read the magnetic tape than Betamax, and VHS machines were faster at rewinding (winding the magnetic tape back to its starting place so that the video starts from the beginning the next time) and fast-forwarding than Betamax machines.\nIn countries that use the PAL and SECAM technical standards for their television broadcasting, Betamax's recording time was similar to VHS and the picture on the television was at least as good as VHS.\nDVDs replaced VCRs.\nIn the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s, the DVD player replaced the VCR as the most common way to watch movies on a home television. The VCR sales dropped later, causing the VCR to be used less by people. VCRs are still available, but fewer stores offer them, because fewer people want them."}

It may occur with or without cycles of normal mood, called euthymia. A mixed episode occurs when both mania and depression are present at the same time.\nSymptoms.\n\"Bipolar\" literally means \"two poles\" or two extremes in how much energy the brain has. Sometimes, a person can experience something called mania. Mania is when a person's brain goes into a high-energy state. When in a high-energy state, mania can cause extreme emotions such as panic attacks or extreme happiness such as euphoria. This feeling is often followed by a period of depression, which is a low-energy state. A person who is depressed may act sad or hopeless. People with bipolar disorder switch between these two states.\nMania.\nPeople who are in a manic state are often over-confident and very optimistic. This can cause them to take large risks and do things that are not normal for them to do. Manic episodes last for at least a week, but can last as long as three to six months. They are usually followed by a depressive episode. A person who is manic may talk very quickly with no pauses, have thoughts that change very quickly, or act without thinking. They may also experience psychosis, where they cannot tell what is real and what is not. They may think that they are unstoppable or that they are on a mission for God. Mania may become so severe that it can affect the person\u2019s ability to work or interact with others. Every person is different, so it is important to remember that these things do not happen to all people with bipolar disorder.\nHypomania.\nHypomania is a less extreme version of mania. Someone who is hypomanic will have symptoms similar to mania. They may have increased energy and may deny that anything is wrong. A hypomanic episode may last from a few days to a few months.\nDepression.\nPeople who are in a depressive state are often sad and pessimistic. They may lose interest in activities they usually like, or become isolated and lonely. Other symptoms include anxiety, hopelessness, changes in sleep, and suicidal thoughts. A depressive episode can last from a few weeks to several months. When bipolar disorder develops at a young age, the first few episodes are usually depressive. Because a manic or hypomanic episode is needed to diagnose bipolar disorder, some people are diagnosed with major depression at first.\nDiagnosis.\nBipolar disorder is an illness that can show in different ways. It is often diagnosed in adolescents or young adults. A few subtypes have been identified; these subtypes mostly describe the nature of the \"episodes\" of the disease:\nCauses.\nThe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. It is estimated that there is a 71 percent chance of bipolar disorder passing from parent to child. If one identical twin has bipolar disorder, there is a 40 to 70 percent chance that the other will develop bipolar disorder in their lifetime. MRI studies have shown that certain parts of the brain responsible for mood regulation are larger in bipolar patients. It is also possible for bipolar disorder to develop after a stroke, brain injury, or certain infections.\nTreatment.\nLike most mental illnesses, there are ways to treat bipolar disorder. The most common way to treat bipolar disorder is by using medications called mood stabilizers. These medicines prevent and control the manic and depressive episodes. One of the most common mood stabilizers is lithium. Therapy can also be used to control the symptoms. The same treatments and medicines do not work for everyone, and it is not uncommon for people to have symptoms return if they stop taking medication. Things like this can make bipolar disorder a difficult illness to live with, but educating patients about it makes it easier. Sometimes, people need to be treated against their will. Patients may be thinking about or have tried to commit suicide, or they may be unable to see their situation properly. In many cases, teaching people about their disease helps. When they have gone through the phases of the illness a few times, they often see that treatment can make their life easier."}

They are still talking about allowing German soldiers to be in the peace keeping missions of the United Nations.\nIn the field of civil rights they copied the position of the Greens, as well."}

A modern laptop is self-contained, with a screen, keyboard and pointing device (like a touchpad), plus usually, speakers, a microphone and a camera. This is all powered by a built-in rechargeable battery, however, the user can also plug the laptop in, to use it and recharge the battery at the same time. Also, most other external devices can be attached if required. The laptop screen folds down over the keyboard, along a hinge, for carrying.\nLaptops have advantages over desktop computers, such as:\nDisadvantages of portable computers include:\nHistory.\nThe portable microcomputer, called the \"Portal,\" from the French company R2E Micral CCMC, officially appeared in September 1980 at the SICOB show in Paris. The Portal had a keyboard with 58 alphanumeric keys and 11 numeric keys (separate blocks), a 32-character LED screen, a floppy disk drive, a printer and a 220V power supply. It weighed 12\u00a0kg (26 pounds) and its dimensions were 45\u00a0cm \u00d7 45\u00a0cm \u00d7 15\u00a0cm (18 in x 18 in x 6 in). It had no hinge and its operating system was Prolog.\nSome historians, however, count as the first \"true\" portable the \"Osborne 1\". It was created in 1981 by Adam Osborne who was also a former book publisher. He was the founder of Osborne Computer. His portable computer weighed 11\u00a0kg (24 pounds) and had a five-inch (13 cm) screen, a serial port and two floppy disk drives. Several programs were included with the Osborne 1. Customers could also buy a 1-hour battery pack.\nThe first \"laptop-sized notebook computer\" was the Epson HX-20, released in July 1982. It had a four-line, liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, a rechargeable battery, and a receipt-size printer, in a 1.6 kg (3.5 lb) body, the size of an A4 notebook. It was described as a \"laptop\" and \"notebook\" computer in its patent. \nThe first computer to use the \"clamshell\" design which is used in almost all modern laptop designs, was the GRiD Systems Corporation's \"GriD Compass, released in April 1982\". This computer was one fifth the weight of any other computer used at that time, however, it required mains power, because it had no battery. Despite this, they were very popular with the Military of the United States amd NASA, who used the laptop in its Space Shuttle program, in the 1980s.\nAlso in 1982, two computer designers from Microsoft, Kazuhiko Nishi and Bill Gates, worked on a new portable computer. The prototype was presented to Radio Shack, who agreed to start making it. It was launched in 1983, as the TRS-80 Model 100, which had an eight-line LCD screen. In 1986, the improved version, called TRS Model 200, was released, which had a much larger, fold-down LCD screen, and looked pretty much like the laptops that we know today. \nThe next few years saw the appearance of a laptop PC from Compaq Computers and the first notebook-style laptop from NEC called NEC UltraLite. The year 1989 was quite successful for laptop producers. First, there was Apple Computer that developed the Macintosh Portable, the evolution of which turned it into the PowerBook. Then a company named Zenith Data Systems introduced its Zenith MinisPort \u2013 a portable computer weighing 6 pounds (2.5\u00a0kg). Finally, there was Compaq Computers, who released the Compaq LTE.\nThe development of laptops is continuing, with various upgrades and additional functions added, including variouspointing devices and disk drives, colour screens and touch screens;all while the devices tended to get smaller and lighter. Notebook or netbook computers are small laptops with screens of about 10\u00a0inches (25cm) or less, but no disk drives. Despite these advances, after 2010, people bought fewer laptops because of the popularity of tablet computers, which are even more portable.\nIn 2005, an organisation called One Laptop Per Child started trying to improve education using cheap laptops.

The party advocates for a more free market economy. Although they agree to some aspects of the German welfare state, they want to see a reduction in government spending and a movement to privatization.\nHistory.\nSeveral liberal parties have existed in Germany since the 19th century.\nThe FDP was founded in West Germany in September of 1945 in the state of Hamburg. It became member of the state parliament of Hamburg in its first election.\nSimilar liberal parties were founded in other German states, most of them successful in getting mandates.\nIn 1947, on March 17th, the \"Demokratische Partei Deutschlands\" (DPD) was founded as a whole-Germany liberal party by Theodor Heuss and Wilhelm K\u00fclz, but it broke down after a short while.\nOn 11 December 1948 the FDP was founded as a liberal party for West Germany.\nChief of the party was Theodor Heuss. The next important man was Thomas Dehler.\nIn its first years the main part of the party followed a national-liberal way. Liberal in the economical field, but very conserative in most other fields.\nBut in every state it had its own way.\nThe FDP was the smaller partner of the CDU under Konrad Adenauer. It was member of the West German government from 1949 to 1966.\nIn 1969 the FDP returned to government. But now the FDP was partner of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands under Willy Brandt, later Helmut Schmidt.\nThe party changed its values. Left-liberal positions were the leading ideas of the FDP at that time and included ideas like\ncivil rights and giving everyone the chance for a good education (guaranteed state stipendia, no more study fees, more higher education schools).\nIt changed again in 1982, when the government crashed on Schmidt and elected Helmut Kohl of the CDU as the new chancellor.\nIt became more and more a single issue party with its only interest in a low tax tarif - especially for high incomes.\nIt fought for study fees now and against social security. It secretary general said one day \"We are the party of the best-incomes\".\nIn 1998 it lost its power and became part of the opposition.\nIn some state parliaments the FDP is still in power as junior partner of the CDU.\nThe party's unofficial motto is \"So viel Staat wie n\u00f6tig, so wenig Staat wie m\u00f6glich!\", meaning \"as much state as necessary, as little state as possible!\""}

It was formed in 1992 by the Western German party \"Die Gr\u00fcnen\" and the Eastern German \"B\u00fcndnis '90\". Its main interests are ecology, civil rights, equality between men and women and the chances of immigrants in the German society.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nIn the 1970s, there were a lot of protests against nuclear power in Germany. The protesters had no support in the political parties in Germany so they got the idea to create their own party.\nThis Party was founded under the Name \"Die Gr\u00fcnen\" in Karlsruhe on 13 January 1980.\nSince their aims were for civil rights and ecology, a lot of former Anti Vietnam War protesters joined the party. The Greens were pacifists and strictly against nuclear weapons. They wanted to reach a de-militarized Europe. After a short while some right-winged people left the party, so they became a centre-left party. The party has centrist and left-wing factions.\nLeaders.\nFirst chiefs of the party were Herbert Gruhl and Petra Kelly. Its current co-leaders are Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, who were elected as the party's co-leaders in January 2018.\nInfluence.\nIn the old GDR, a Green party was founded in 1989 and joined to the Western Greens in 1990. In 1993 the B\u00fcndnis 90 - a civil rights movement from the former GDR - and Die Gr\u00fcnen joined them.\nIn 1998 they joined the federal government under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der together with the Social Democrats.\nProgramme.\nAlliance '90/The Greens support green politics. One of their main issues is saving the earth - especially the climate - without using nuclear power.\nAnother issue raised by the party is the integration and the chances of immigrants in Germany.\nIn the foreign policy the Green changed their position in their first period in federal government. Before that time they wanted German soldiers only to allow peace keeping missions of the United Nations, many Greens wanted a de-militarized Germany. After their legislative period - with main influence of foreign secretary Fischer - they accepted to join international military missions e.g. in Afganisthan. But their main issue is to avoid conflicts by development policy and international cooperation. Main issues of foreign policy are international envoirementional and climate saving projects like the Kyoto protocoll, the development of the European Union and a reform of the international law like the installing of the International Crime Court in The Hague."}

This is also called a \"Gunter's chain\", \"surveyor's chain\" or \"land chain\".\nHistory and usage.\nThe chain was originally called an \"acre's breadth\", because it was the width of a acre, while a furlong was the length.\nEdmund Gunter, a clergyman and mathematician, invented a measuring device called a chain. The chain was long. It was divided by 100 in small metal links. The links were made of thick wire with a loop at each end. The links were connected to each other by three rings. There were brass handles at each end. People folded the chain up, link by link, and carried it in their hand. The name \"chain\" comes from these devices.\nThe unit was once important in everyday life in the United Kingdom and its colonies and in the United States. People used it when they made maps and planned out cities and towns. Land was surveyed and measured using these chains. Even after more accurate ways of measuring land were invented, many people continued to use the chain as a unit because land had already been surveyed in this method for so long.\nIn England, it is still used in old railways, along with miles.

The word \"furlong\" comes from Old English words \"furh\" (\"furrow\") and \"lang\" (\"long\"). Originally it was the length of the furrow in one acre of a ploughed field. An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one chain wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an \"acre's length\". Around the year 1300, England standardized the furlong as 40 rods or 660 feet.\nThe length of the furlong was standardized between South Africa, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada , New Zealand and the United States in the International Pound and Yard Agreement.\nThe furlong was abolished for official use in the UK in 1985. It is still occasionally seen on road signs in Myanmar.\nDistances for horse racing in the UK, Ireland, and Canada are still given in miles and furlongs. The unit is not used otherwise. It is considered to be an \"archaic\" unit.\nThe proverb \"one furlong per fortnight\" means to express something in as obscure and little-used units as possible. (A fortnight is two weeks, or fourteen days). The proverb itself means speed, and is the same as 0.000166309524 m/s or 0.17 mm/s."}

If people know how good an algorithm is in its worst case, they can guarantee that the algorithm will be at least that good in \"every\" case.

It is listed in the mental health diagnosis manual DSM IV. \nThis is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it. The main symptoms of DID are a person showing two or more \"identities\" or \"personality states\". The person behaves differently depending which identity is in control. The second important symptom is when a person forgets important, personal things which people normally do not forget. \nA person is not diagnosed with DID if the symptoms are caused by drugs, illness or (with children) pretending to play with imaginary friends. Doctors must also rule out pretending to have DID for attention or sympathy, and malingering (pretending to have DID for some personal gain). Most patients with DID are also diagnosed with other mental disorders.\nDefinitions.\nThe DSM IV uses the terms \"identity\", \"personality states\" and \"alternate identities\" when talking about DID and other people use the term \"alters\" to mean the same thing. These words can be confusing since not everyone uses the same definition. Professionals have not agreed on a specific definition for a personality; other terms, including dissociation and amnesia, may also be defined differently by different professionals. When talking about DID, saying someone changes personalities or alters means the person speaks and acts differently, and usually responds to a different name.\nDissociation is a symptom. Most people experience normal dissociation, where they stop paying attention to what is happening around them. People with DID have pathological dissociation, which is much more serious. It involves problems with memory and attention that make it hard for people to work, shop and have relationships with other people. Everyone can dissociate but some people can do it much more easily and to an extreme that can be unhealthy. Some doctors think trauma causes the dissociation that is seen in disorders like DID.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAccording to the DSM-IV, the symptoms of DID are \"the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states\" (which are often called \"alters\"), as well as forgetting things that people normally don't forget. Also, the symptoms cannot be caused by drugs or normal childhood play. People can report having a lot of alters, or just a couple. Most people diagnosed with DID have less than ten, though some have said they have several thousand. A person diagnosed with DID cannot be diagnosed with another dissociative disorder. Because people with DID hear voices of different alters, it may be confused with schizophrenia. However, the two problems are very different and doctors can usually tell if a patient has DID or schizophrenia by asking the right questions. DID is always diagnosed by what patients tell their doctors and what the doctor thinks this means. There are no objective tests using blood or machines that can tell if someone has DID. Though people have tried diagnosing and studying DID using medical imaging or brain scanning.\nDiagnosis.\nThe DSM uses the following criteria to diagnose DID:\nThe International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) uses the term multiple personality disorder instead of dissociative identity disorder. It classifies DID in section F44.8, \"Other dissociative [conversion] disorders\".\nCauses.\nThere are two main ideas about what causes DID, but there is still disagreement about which is correct. The trauma model says that DID is caused by parents or family that abuse or neglect their children. Some of these children deny the abuse is happening or pretend it is happening to someone else, and this eventually becomes a different identity or alter. Most people diagnosed with DID say they remember being abused by their parents or other caregivers when they were children. When asked about their childhood, patients with DID are more likely to say they were abused or neglected than people with any other diagnosis. However, the idea that DID develops in childhood is disputed because childhood memories are not very reliable and it is not clear if the abuse actually happened. Though DID has been diagnosed in children, there are reasons to believe the diagnosis is because of the influence of parents and doctors rather than abuse. There is not enough good scientific evidence about DID in childhood to be sure DID is actually caused by abuse or something else. \nThe iatrogenic or sociocognitive model (SCM) of DID says it is created during psychotherapy when the therapist creates false memories and patients become convinced they have multiple personalities. Some patients may be more likely to develop DID in these circumstances because they are naturally more likely to accept their therapists are right about DID. SCM supporters also think that patients have seen DID in movies and books, and this shows them how people with DID are supposed to behave, which makes it easier for them to change their behavior when they are supposed to be a new alter. They also say the criteria used by the DSM are unclear which makes it hard to agree whether a patient has DID or another diagnosis.\nA middle position says that trauma may change how the brain remembers things which makes it easier to remember things that did not actually happen. It has also been suggested that early trauma may make children more likely to use their imaginations to pretend abuse or other painful situations are not happening, and if they enter therapy when they are older, it is easier for therapists to convince them they have DID.\nTreatment.\nThere is no treatment approach that has been scientifically proven to work. Most therapists who treat patients with DID use several different approaches. Therapy usually lasts for several years, and does not always work. Some therapists try to reduce or eliminate the alters so the patient only has one personality, while others do not. The ISSTD recommends first improving a patient's ability to deal with symptoms and live more normal lives, then trying to deal with traumatic memories. The final step is bringing all the identities together so the patient can access all of their memories.\nPrognosis.\nSometimes patients with DID will get better without any help, but this is not common. Patients with more diagnoses than just DID often take longer to improve.\nEpidemiology.\nThere have been no large-scale studies to learn how common DID is. The ISSTD says DID occurs in between 1 and 3% in the general population, and between 1 and 5% in groups of patients in hospitals. DID is more common in women than in men but this may be caused by men with DID being sent to prison instead of hospitals. The number of people diagnosed with DID increased from about 200 in 1970 to about 20,000 in the 1990s. According to the ISSTD this is because doctors did not have the training or experience to recognize DID. Instead they diagnosed people with depression, PTSD or borderline personality disorder. People who support the SCM say the increase in diagnoses was because a small number of doctors diagnosed a large number of people and because a large number of therapists began using types of psychotherapy that made people think they had DID.\nHistory and culture.\nBefore 1900 it was thought DID was caused by spirits or ghosts who controlled people's behavior. The first case of DID described in medicine was in 1646 by the Swiss doctor Paracelsus. DID was very uncommon until the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1990 the number of cases reported in medicine went from about 200 to more than 20,000. In 1994, the 4th edition of the DSM was published, which changed the name from \"multiple personality disorder\" to \"dissociative identity disorder\". The DSM also changed how DID was diagnosed. Many scientific articles were written about DID during the same period, though after 1995 the number of articles published every year decreased. Today there is little research on DID.\nEven though DID is a very rare, there are a lot of books, plays and movies about people with DID. In 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson published the short book \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" which was very popular. People later thought that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were examples of someone with DID. \"The Three Faces Of Eve\" was a movie made in 1957 about a woman with DID. \"Sybil\", a popular book about a woman with DID, was published in 1973. It was made into a movie in 1976, and a second time in 2007. A survey done in 2001 of American and Canadian psychiatrists found that there was a lot of disagreement and skepticism about diagnosing DID and if the diagnosis was based on enough good quality science.\nDID in the legal system.\nLawyers and doctors who work with the law also consider DID to be very controversial. Since the 1990s, DID has become more common in courts. People have tried to avoid going to prison for such crimes as murder and serial rape by claiming to have DID, and lawyers and judges are concerned about people pretending to have DID to avoid going to prison. The first time this happened was in 1976, and since that time most people who commit crimes and claim it was because of DID have gone to prison."}

These people are the staff of the organization. In general, any person hired by an employer to do a particular job in exchange for payment is an employee, but there are different kinds of employees. In some countries, employers are required by law to do certain things, like obey minimum wage laws, provide a safe workplace, and sometimes pay a tax. Employers also have to give their official employees benefits, like paying for health insurance. Because of this, some employers like to hire independent contractors to do work instead of regular employees. In the United States, a worker is an employee if their employer gets to tell them what do do, how to do it, and when to do it in a material way and an independent contractor if they get to make their own decisions about how to do what the employer wants.\nThe relationship between employer and employee is different from that between the firm and a customer or client.\nAn employee usually has to provide a resume and have an interview before being offered a job. \nIndependent contractors.\nSome employers like to hire independent contractors, or workers who are technically running their own businesses, because they do not have to follow all of the same laws. For example, in the United States, an employer has to some of the employee's social security taxes and the employee pays the rest. A self-employed person pays for all of his or her own social security taxes.\nFor example, if a company hires a plumber every time they need a leak or pipe fixed in their building, that plumber is an independent contractor. If a company hires a plumber to be part of their company, then that plumber is an employee. They must pay the employee plumber whether there are leaks to fix or not. They must obey any minimum wage laws that the country has. They must provide other things. But the employer gets to tell the employee plumber what to do and how to do it much more than an independent contractor plumber. They can make the employee plumber follow a dress code, while the independent plumber gets to wear what he or she wants. They can make the employee plumber come in or leave on a set schedule like other employees. The independent contractor plumber gets to decide when to come to work, usually by making an appointment with the employer.\nSome companies like to hire independent contractors and then tell them exactly what to do and when to do it, like regular employees. They can get in trouble for this. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service can sue companies that lie about whether their employees really are independent contractors."}

It was released in Japan on December 22, 2005, in North America on March 28, 2006, and in Europe on September 29, 2006.\nIn \"Kingdom Hearts II\", the player controls a 15-year-old boy named Sora. Sora goes through different worlds (based around many different Disney movies) fighting different enemies like Heartless and Nobodies. Occasionally, there will be enemies you have to defeat that are based on the world you are in, such as the cursed pirates in Pirates of the Caribbean.\nStory.\nThe player starts the game controlling Roxas, a 15-year-old boy living in Twilight Town. He is on summer vacation with his three best friends, Hayner, Pence, and Olette. As a week goes by, strange things begin to happen. A man named Axel, a member of Organization XIII, becomes upset at Roxas for not remembering him. They fight, and Roxas discovers that he can use a Keyblade. Roxas also meets Namin\u00e9 and a man named DiZ who was in Riku's side of \"Chain of Memories\". Namin\u00e9 tells Roxas she has been changing his memories so he can become \"whole\" again. Axel tells Roxas they used to be friends and that he must either take Roxas back to the Organization or destroy him. They battle, and Axel disappears. Roxas then finds Sora, and disappears himself. After Roxas disappears, Sora wakes up and becomes a playable character. Donald and Goofy also wake up, and the three of them continue their mission to find Riku. As they search for him, they meet the rest of the members of Organization XIII and learn that they are beings called Nobodies. When a Heartless steals someone's heart, that person also becomes a Heartless, but if their heart is strong, their body becomes a Nobody. Nobodies have no emotions, but want to have hearts again. Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII, is trying to summon Kingdom Hearts, which he claims will enable the Nobodies to get their hearts back. To summon Kingdom Hearts, Heartless must be killed with a Keyblade, which will release the hearts they hold and let them return to Kingdom Hearts. This is the reason the Organization wanted Sora to join them. It is later revealed that Roxas is Sora's Nobody and was a member of Organization XIII. Roxas was created when Sora briefly lost his heart. Namin\u00e9 reveals herself to be Kairi's Nobody, who was created when Kairi lost her heart at the beginning of \"Kingdom Hearts\". Xemnas is the Nobody of a man called Xehanort, who no longer exists. Ansem, the main enemy from the first game, was Xehanort's Heartless. After defeating Xemnas, Sora and his friends return home.\nFinal Mix +.\n\"Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix +\" is a reissue of the game that was released only in Japan on March 29, 2007. It has more content than \"Kingdom Hearts II\", including new areas, new battles, and a new secret ending. It is also for the PlayStation 2."}

It was the distance a person could walk in about one hour. The Romans adopted the league and it became a common unit of measurement throughout western Europe and Latin America.\nIn English-speaking countries the league was usually three statute miles (4.828032 kilometres) on land or three nautical miles (5.556\u00a0km) at sea. However, in writing the word \"league\" often means the Spanish, Portuguese or French league.\nAncient Rome.\nThe league was used by Ancient Rome, which defined it as being Roman miles (7500 Roman feet or 2.22\u00a0km). The origin is the \"leuga gallica\" \" (also: leuca Gallica)\", the league of Gaul. The ancient league was short but the unit grew longer over time.\nArgentina.\nIn Argentina a league is a distance of 5\u00a0km.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil the league was 6\u00a0km but it is not used anymore.\nFrance.\nThe French league had different values at different times: 10 000, 12 000, 13 200 and 14 400 French feet, about 3.25\u00a0km to about 4.68\u00a0km. It was used for a while together with the metric system but it is not used now. The French league was three nautical miles.\nMexico.\nIn the Mexican countryside the league is still commonly used in the original sense of the distance a person can walk in an hour. So a league along a good road on level ground is longer than a league on a difficult path over rough ground.\nSpain.\nThe Spanish league was originally set as a fixed unit of distance of 5,000 varas (a Spanish yard), about 2.6 miles or 4.2\u00a0km. In 1568 Philip II of Spain officially abolished the league. However, in parts of Latin America, people still use it (with different meanings in different countries)."}

In 1948, the CGPM adopted the name \"newton\" for this force. The MKS system then became the blueprint for today's SI International System of Units. That made the newton the standard unit of force.\nThis SI unit is named after Isaac Newton. As with every International System of Units (SI) unit named for a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (N). However, when an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower case letter (newton)\u2014except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case.

A corporation's status and capacity is determined by the law of the place of incorporation.\nInvestors and entrepreneurs often form joint stock companies. Therefore, the term \"corporation\" often means such \"business corporations\". Corporations may also be formed for local government (municipal corporation), political, religious, and charitable purposes (not-for-profit corporation), or government programs (government-owned corporation). Condominiums are a common kind of non-profit corporation.\nIn common speech, the word \"corporation\" refers usually to limited responsibility corporation.

The tower has 108 stories, though the building's owners count the main roof as 109 and the mechanical penthouse roof as 110. When it finished costruction in 1973, it beat the World Trade Center in New York City to become the tallest building in the world. It was the tallest building in the world for twenty-five years until the Petronas Towers were built in Malaysia. It was also the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere for 41 years, until the new One World Trade Center beat it in 2013.\nWillis Tower is seen as the best work of architect Fazlur Khan. As of 2021, it is the third-tallest building in the United States and the Western hemisphere. It is also the 23rd-tallest in the world. Each year, more than one million people visit its observation deck, the highest in the United States. It is one of Chicago's most popular tourist places. The tower was renamed in 2009 after the Willis Group bought the tower.\nThe building's largest office partner is United Airlines, which moved its corporate headquarters from 77 West Wacker Drive in 2012. Other major company offices in the tower include Schiff Hardin and Seyfarth Shaw. Morgan Stanley moved into the tower in 2019.\nIt was known as the Sears Tower until 2009, as it was the headquarters of retail company Sears from its opening in 1974. Many people from Chicago still call the tower by its original name.\nHistory.\nPlanning and construction.\nIn 1969, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. was the largest retailer in the world, with about 350,000 employees. Sears wanted to put many of its employees into one building on the western part of Chicago's Loop. The company was given a location by West Chicago Loop not far from Grant Park. Sears eventually bought the West Chicago loop location and bought 15 old buildings from 100 owners and paid $2.7 million to the city. Sears and the city of Chicago approved the design and construction began in April 1971. \nSears needed of office space for its planned tower\u3002They hired architects Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM). Sears paid for construction of the building. Architects Bruce Graham and Fazlur Khan designed the building. They designed it as a nine square \"tubes\". It was connected in a 3\u00d73 metal wrap forming a square base with sides. All nine tubes would rise up to the 50th floor of the building, where the northwest and southeast tubes end. The northeast and southwest tubes reach the 66th floor with the north, east, and south tubes end at the 90th. The last west and center tubes reach 108 floors. The Sears Tower was the first building to use this design. It was both cheaper and stronger. At 1,450 feet, it had more space and was higher than the Empire State Building. It cost much less per unit area. The system became successful in skyscraper construction and has been used in most supertall buildings.\nWith the floors left over Sears decided to rent them to other companies for offices. Small metal floors were added to give enough space to people working in the tower. Skidmore architects proposed a tower with large, floors in the lower part of the building. They also added metal floors with many setbacks, which would give the tower its well known look.\nThe tower passed the height of New York's unfinished World Trade Center to become the world's tallest building. The height was limited by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to protect air traffic. Two antennas were added at the top of the building for television and radio broadcasting. The building was completed in May 1973 and opened the next year. Construction cost about US$150\u00a0million.\nBlack bands appear on the tower around the 29th\u201332nd, 64th\u201365th, 88th\u201389th, and 104th\u2013108th floors. These give the building's environmental support systems and hide its belted trusses. Even though adding a fire sprinkler system was not forced, the building was built with one from the beginning. There are around 40,000 sprinkler heads in the building. They cost $4 million.\nIn February 1982, two television antennas were added to the building, increasing its total height to . The western antenna was made bigger, bringing the overall height to on June 5, 2000. It was done to improve reception of local NBC station WMAQ-TV.\nLegal action.\nAs the construction of the building reached as the 50th floor in 1972, people sued Sears and wanted to stop the building from passing 67 floors. The lawsuits said that above the 67th floor would make television signals bad.\nThe Illinois Citizens' Committee for Broadcasting wanted the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to stop the building from getting taller. On May 26, 1972, the Commission did not take action as they did not have the power to do anything. On June 30, 1972, the Illinois Supreme Court supported their decision. On September 8, 1972, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit supported the FCC decision, ending the lawsuit.\nAfter opening.\nThe tower did not have as many companies buying office spaces and it was half-empty for many years. In the 2000s, many companies in the tower began to leave because of terrorist threats or because they found better office spaces.\nIn 1984, Sears decided to improve the appearance of the lower floors for civilians and tourists. Their solution was to create a new entrance, which became known as \"Lunchbox Entrance\". Sears wanted to sell the building in the late 1980s. In July 1990, with no possible buyers, Sears took out a mortgage loan on the tower for $850\u00a0million from MetLife and AEW Capital Management. Sears talked about the loan again in 1994. This led to an agreement where Sears would no longer be responsible for the $850\u00a0million loan, although it would only own the name of the building. As part of the 1994 agreement, AEW and Metlife would own the building in 2003.\nIn 1990, the law firm of Keck, Mahin &amp; Cate wanted to move away from the tower and into 77 West Wacker Drive. Just two years later, Sears began to move out of the tower to Hoffman Estates, Illinois.\nHowever, in 1997, the Canadian company TrizecHahn bought AEW's holdings of the building for $110\u00a0million. After the September 11 attacks, two of the largest office partners, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, quickly announced plans leave the building's 300,000\u00a0ft2 space. In 2003, Trizec sold its holdings of the tower to MetLife for $9\u00a0million.\nIn 2004, MetLife sold the building to a group of investors from New York City and Skokie, Illinois. The price was $840\u00a0million, with $825\u00a0million held in a mortgage.\nIn June 2006, seven men were arrested by the FBI and charged with plans to destroy the tower. The case went to court in October 2007. After three trials, five of the suspects were convicted and two acquitted. The leader of the group, Narseal Batiste, was sentenced to 13.5 years in prison. In response to the possible threat of an attack, the building's largest company space at this time, Ernst &amp; Young, moved to North Wacker Drive in early 2009.\nSince 2007, the owners had thought about building a hotel on the north side of the building. The second building was thought about in the original design. The plan was eventually cancelled as the city did not allow the construction of a tall building in that location.\nIn February 2009, the owners announced they were thinking about painting the building silver, an idea that was later stopped. It was hoped that a new paint-job would \"rebrand\" the building and show its energy efficiency for a cost of $50\u00a0million.\nIn 2015, the Blackstone Group bought the tower for a reported $1.3\u00a0billion, the highest price ever paid for a U.S. property outside of New York City. In 2017, Blackstone announced a $500 million renovation for the building, such as building a six-story commercial area in the tower's plaza area.\nIn May 2020, after many days of raining, the building's three basement levels were flooded. This caused the power to go out and many television and radio stations going off the air.\nNaming rights.\nSears' naming rights ended in 2003, but the building was still called the Sears Tower for many years. In March 2009, the British insurance company Willis Group Holdings agreed to rent a part of the building and got the naming rights. On July 16, 2009, the building was officially renamed the Willis Tower. On August 13, 2012, United Airlines said they were moving its corporate headquarters from 77 West Wacker Drive to Willis Tower.\nThe naming rights are legally kept for 15 years, making it is possible that the building's name change again as soon as 2024. Many Chicagoans still call the tower by its old name. A July 2009 CNN article showed some Chicagoans did not want to call the tower by its new name. An October 2010 article from \"Chicago\" magazine called the building one of Chicago's 40 most important things. The author of the article did not want call it the \"Willis Tower\". \"Time\" magazine called the name change one of the top 10 worst corporate name changes.\nClimbing.\nOn May 25, 1981, Dan Goodwin climbed the tower while using suction cups and wearing a Spider-Man costume. The Chicago Fire Department tried to stop him, but he made the first successful outside climb of the tower. Goodwin was arrested at the top after the seven-hour climb and was later charged with trespassing.\nIn August 1999, Alain \"Spiderman\" Robert climbed the building all the way to the top using only his hands and feet. He climbed at the last 20 stories of the building.\nSince 2009, the Willis Tower has hosted SkyRise Chicago, the world's tallest indoor stair climb as a charity event. At the event, people can legally walk up the building's 103-story staircase.\nDetails and height.\nSkidmore architects designed the Willis Tower to have large floors of in the lower part of the building. They got the design idea from an advertisement for a package of cigarettes.\nFrom the ground to the top of the taller antenna, Willis Tower is tall. It leans about towards the west because of unequal weight on its foundation. The observation deck elevators are the fastest in the world at per minute. With clear weather, four states can be seen from the observation deck: Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. \nThe Willis Tower is the third tallest building in the Americas (after One World Trade Center and Central Park Tower) and the Western Hemisphere. With a height of with its antenna, it is the third-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas and eighth-tallest freestanding structure in the world.\nOn November 8, 2013, architects in Chicago and New York City started talking about the height of the One World Trade Center. They were saying that Willis Tower might be taller. Four days later, it was made official that One World Trade Center is taller than the Willis Tower.\nAt the bottom, the lowest level of Willis Tower is 43 feet below elevation. Many broadcast station transmitters are built at the top of Willis Tower.\nThe Skydeck.\nThe Willis Tower observation deck is called the Skydeck. It opened on June 22, 1974. It is on the 103rd floor. It is the highest observation deck in the United States and one of Chicago's most famous tourist attractions. About 1.7\u00a0million tourists visit the tower every year. Elevators reach the top of the building in about 60 seconds. This can make people to feel the change in pressure as they go up. The tourist entrance can be found on the south side of the building along Jackson Boulevard. A second observation deck on the 99th floor was created as a backup and for private events. \nIn January 2009, work to improve the Skydeck began, such as adding glass balconies that go outside of the building. The all-glass boxes, known as \"The Ledge\", allow visitors to see the street below. The boxes can hold . It opened to the public on July 2, 2009. On May 29, 2014, the laminated glass flooring of one of the boxes broke while visitors were inside but there were no injuries. The flooring on that same box cracked on June 12, 2019.\nAwards.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave the tower ENERGY STAR certification in 2018. This is for being one of the best buildings of its type in the United States for energy efficiency."}

There are 350,000 different species of beetles which have been named: about 40% of all known insects. There are an estimated 800,000 to a million living species. Beetles live almost everywhere, though not in the ocean or in places that are very cold, such as Antarctica.\nBeetles went through a massive adaptive radiation early in their evolutionary history. The evolution of flowering plants helped drive the diversification of beetles. Four of the six biggest families of beetles mainly eat flowering plants.\nBeetle bodies.\nIn common with other insects, there are three main parts to a beetle's body: the head, the thorax (the middle part), and the abdomen (the back part). On the head, beetles have antennae (feelers), eyes, and a mouth. The legs and wings of the beetle are attached to the thorax. The abdomen of a beetle does not usually have special parts on the outside, but it has the beetle\u2019s gut inside. Like other insects, beetles have no internal bones, but instead have a hard exoskeleton on the outside of the body. The exoskeleton is made of hard plates of chitin.\nWings.\nBeetles differ from other flying insects because their front wings have evolved into hard covers, or elytra. The back wings are used for flying. They are thin and are kept under the elytra when at rest. Beetles lift their elytra out of the way in order to fly. A few species of true bugs have a similar arrangement.\nNot all beetles can fly. Some beetles do not have back wings, and some cannot lift their front wings out of the way. A few beetles have no wings at all. Some beetles with no wings look like larvae, and are called \"larviform\". An example is the family Phengodidae, glow-worms where the females are larviform throughout their lives.\nLegs.\nThe legs of beetles help them to walk, run, swim, and dig. All beetles have six legs that is made out of several parts. Each leg ends in two to five small segments called \"tarsi\". The last tarsus (the singular of tarsi) of each beetle \u201cfoot\u201d has one or two claws on the end of it. Most beetles use their legs to walk or run. Some beetle legs are flat and have long hairs on them. These kinds of legs are found on water beetles. Beetles that often dig in soil have flat legs with spines or horns at the edges. Flat legs with horns are called fossorial legs. A few beetles have large hind legs, similar to those of grasshoppers, which help the beetle to jump. Flea beetles are an example of jumping beetle.\nSight and smell.\nBeetles have compound eyes, which means the two big shiny eyes on the head are actually made out of many smaller parts. Sometimes the two eyes are each divided in half so that it looks like there are four eyes. One beetle family, the whirligig beetles, has divided eyes so that when they are swimming they can see on top of the water and under the water at the same time. A few beetles have extra simple eyes (usually two) called ocelli. The ocelli are on the top of the beetle\u2019s head.\nBeetles use their antennae to smell things. Beetles also use their antennae to feel things around them. Beetle antennae do not all look the same. Some antennae are long and thin, while others are short and wide. Thin antennae are called filiform antennae, and antennae that are wide on the end are called clavate antennae.\nThe mouth.\nThe mouth of a beetle is very different from the mouth of a person. Most beetles have two hard mandibles at the front of their mouth which are a bit like teeth. Mandibles help the beetle eat by crushing and cutting food. In some beetles, the mandibles look like big pincers. Beetles also have four \u201cfingers\u201d around their mouth that push food into the mouth of the beetle. These fingers are called palpi.\nOther.\nBeetles do not breathe; instead they have holes called spiracles in the sides of their bodies which lead to trachea, which act like lungs. Beetles do not have blood, but they have something like blood, called haemolymph. It is a green colour. That's because their haemoglobin molecule has a copper atom at its centre, whereas ours has an iron atom there.\nHow beetles grow.\nBeetles start out as eggs that a female beetle lays. Some beetles can lay thousands of eggs during their lives. A larva comes out when an egg hatches. Most beetle larvae do not look like adult beetles. A beetle larva eats and grows larger until it changes and becomes a pupa. When the pupa opens, an adult beetle, sometimes called an imago, comes out. This way of growing up is called complete metamorphosis.\nBeetles eat the most when they are larvae. Some beetle larvae eat the outside of plants; some eat inside plants. Some beetle larvae are predators, which means they hunt for other insects to eat. Other beetle larvae eat dead things, such as dead plants and dead animals.\nNot all beetle larvae look the same. Some beetle larvae are flat and move very fast. To describe these larvae, scientists use the descriptive word campodeiform. Some beetle larvae look similar to hard worms with tiny legs. These have an elateriform shape. Click beetle larvae have a special name: wireworms. Other beetle larvae are short and very thick and are called grubs. In a few beetles, the larvae change their shape after some time. Blister beetle larvae start out moving fast, such as campodeiform larvae, but end up slow and thick.\nWhat beetles do.\nFood.\nBeetles eat many different things including living plants, rotting plants, animals that may be dead or alive, and animal faeces. Some beetles can eat both plants and animals, while others eat just one type of food. Beetles that can only eat one kind of thing are said to be host specific. Many leaf beetles and longhorn beetles are host specific.\nProtection.\nBeetles are tough animals for their size. They are mechanically tough (the elytra), and have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity, and active defence.\nSome beetles live in places that are hard for predators to find. Some beetles, such as longhorn beetles, live in tunnels inside tree branches. Only special predators that are small enough to use the long-horned beetle tunnels can eat the longhorn beetles.\nOther beetles do not live in special places but they have colours or shapes that make them hard to find. When beetles have colours so that predators cannot see them, this is called camouflage. Some leaf beetles are green so that they can not be seen when they are on green leaves. Some beetles have very complex colours so that they look like bird droppings.\nSometimes beetles use colour to warn predators (warning colouration). Some beetles have black and yellow stripes so that they look similar to bees and wasps. Some beetles even behave similar to bees to confuse predators.\nBeetles have a wide range of chemical defences, mostly got from plants their larvae eat. These chemicals make them taste bad when predators eat them. Blister beetles are so poisonous that if a horse eats only a few of them, the horse may die. Bombardier beetles squirt hot poisonous liquid at attackers. Lady beetles put out a cyanide compound when molested. Lady beetles also have colours that warn predators that they taste bad. Insects which taste foul use warning colours which birds learn to avoid. Also, other species which are tasty copy those warning colours. This is a type of mimicry, and is quite common in insects.\nVery large beetles sometimes fight predators. Beetles that fight will often use their mandibles to injure their predators.\nReproduction.\nBeetles have sexual reproduction, and almost all go through complete metamorphosis. Some beetles have complex behavior to get a mate. Pheromones are used, and different species use different pheromones. Before reproduction, some male beetles sometimes fight to claim a female. This especially happens with stag beetles: males will fight using their long mandibles. More often, male and female beetle go through a long routine before mating. The details differ in each species and that is the point. It is essential that mating takes place between beetles of the same species.\nSome beetles give special care to their eggs or larvae. Some scarab beetles, called dung beetles, roll balls of dung (faeces) and put them in a hole in the ground. The female lays her eggs in the dung. When the eggs hatch, the larvae will eat the dung that their mother supplied for them.\nBeetle evolution.\nIn 2009, a fossil beetle was found in the Pennsylvanian of Mazon Creek, Illinois. This put the origin of the beetles back to . Fossils from this time have been found in Asia and Europe, for instance in the red slate fossil beds of Niedermoschel near Mainz, Germany. Other fossils have been found in Obora, Czech Republic and Tshekarda in the Ural Mountains, Russia. The first discoveries from North America in Oklahoma were published in 2005 and 2008.\nAfter the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, the fossil record of insects is poor, but there are some beetles from the Lower Triassic. At the Babiy Kamen site in the Kuznetsk Basin, there are many beetle fossils, including entire specimens of the infraorders Archostemata (e.g. Ademosynidae, Schizocoleidae), Adephaga (e.g., Triaplidae, Trachypachidae) and Polyphaga (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Byrrhidae, Elateroidea).\nDuring the Jurassic (), there was a dramatic increase in the number of beetle families, including the development and growth of carnivorous and herbivorous species. Dung beetles, and herbivorous beetles living on conifers, were common in the Jurassic period. The evolution of flowering plants in the Cretaceous led to the vast numbers of beetle species there are today.\nKinds of beetles.\nSuborders.\nThere are four living suborders of beetles:\nCommon families.\nDifferent kinds of beetles can be divided into groups called families. There are many beetle families. The biggest families are listed here.\nPopular names.\nPopular names are often misleading; that is why biologists use scientific names in Latin. People call some beetles by other names. Fireflies (also called lightning bugs) are actually beetles; so are ladybirds or ladybugs, which biologists call lady beetles.\nBeetles and people.\nSome beetles cause trouble for farmers and people in forests because they eat crops or trees. These beetles are called pests. One beetle that hurts crops is the Colorado beetle; another is the Maize weevil. One that destroys trees is the Emerald ash borer.\nOther beetles help people; lady beetles (also called ladybirds and ladybugs) eat insects that hurt crops and trees.\nPeople who study beetles are called coleopterists."}

Musical notes can be placed either on a line (i.e. with a line going through the middle of the note head) or in a space. There are four inside spaces as well as the two outer spaces at the top or bottom.\nThe higher the pitch of the note the higher it will be on the staff. Taking the white notes of a keyboard: each note (A, B, C, D etc.) is placed higher on the stave (line, space, line, space etc.). A clef is needed to show which notes they are. There are different clefs to suit high, medium or low instruments.\nThis musical example shows the opening of \"Symphony no 5\" by Beethoven. The first three notes are on the second line (counting from the bottom). They are Gs, because there is a treble clef at the beginning of the staff. The fourth note is a little lower: on the bottom line, the E line (because of the flats in the key signature it is an E flat). The next note is between the other two in pitch (an F). After the three Fs comes a D in the outside bottom space.\nSometimes composers have used staves with fewer or more than 5 lines, but the five-line staff started to become the usual one in Western music in the 13th century.\nWhen notes are a little too high or low to put on the stave, extension lines are used. These are called ledger lines. \nIf two or more staves are being played at the same time the staves are joined on the left by a bracket which is called a brace. Piano music, for example, is written on two staves: one for the right hand and one for the left.\nInstruments that only play a rhythm (such as the cymbals), do not need a stave. The notes can be written just on one line. The beats are crosses. It's modern notation started from the Catholic Church."}

However, not every population is resistant to every chemical.\nThe Colorado beetle first lived in the southwest United States and northern Mexico. Now it lives in most of North America and also in Europe and Asia.\nWhat it eats.\nThe Colorado potato beetle now eats cultivated potato plants. Both larvae and adults eat the leaves and strip the plant down to a skeleton. They may also attack tomato and eggplants. There can be so many Colorado potato beetles in potato farms that they destroy the potatoes.\nDefence.\nBecause the beetle rapidly evolves resistance to chemicals, the best defence may be biological control. A ground beetle, \"Lebia grandis\" is a predator of the eggs and larvae, and its larvae are parasitoids of the Colorado beetle's pupae. \n\"Beauveria bassiana\" (Hyphomycetes) is a pathogenic fungus that infects many insects, including the Colorado beetle. It is probably the most widely used natural enemy of the Colorado beetle. There are commercial formulations that can be applied using a pesticide sprayer. \nOrigins.\nThe Colorado potato beetle did not always eat potato plants. This is because potatoes came from South America, not near the beetle's original range. Before people brought potatoes to North America, the Colorado beetle ate a plant called buffalo-bur."}

Even though they belong to the arachnid family, harvestmen are not spiders. They are in the order Opiliones or Phalangids.\nMore than 6,400 species of harvestmen have been discovered, although the real number of extant species may be more than 10,000. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million year old Rhynie cherts of Scotland. The samples found look surprisingly modern. Apparently, the basic structure of the harvestmen has not changed much since then.\nIn some places, harvestmen are known by the name \"daddy longlegs\", but this name is also used for two other unrelated arthropods: the crane fly (\"Tipulidae\") and the cellar spider (\"Pholcidae\").\nMany species are omnivores, they eat anything they can find. Most of the time this is small insects, and some plants and fungi. Some are scavengers.\nHarvestmen are not dangerous to humans. None of the described species have poison glands. They are not \"true\" spiders even though they look like spiders in many ways. For example, harvestmen have no venom or silk glands; spiders have these.\nAnatomy.\nThese arachnids have exceptionally long walking legs, compared to body size, although there are also short-legged species. In harvestmen the two main body sections (the abdomen and cephalothorax) are broadly joined, so that they appear to be one oval structure; they also have no venom or silk glands, unlike true spiders. In more advanced species, the first five abdominal segments are often fused into a dorsal shield called the scutum, which is normally fused with the carapace. In some species, this shield is only present in males. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and works as antennae. This can be hard to see in short-legged species.\nThe feeding apparatus (Stomotheca) differs from other arachnids as they are able to eat their food in chunks, without needing to liquify it. Most species have a single pair of eyes in the middle of their heads, oriented horizontally. However, there are some eyeless species."}

Crane flies look similar to large mosquitoes but, unlike mosquitoes, crane flies do not bite people or animals. Crane flies occasionally eat nectar.\nThey are also known as daddy longlegs around the world. The term 'daddy-long-legs' is also given to arachnids of the order Opiliones or the family Pholcidae. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets.\nThere are about 15,000 different species and 525 genera of crane flies. This means that the Tipulidae (crane flies) are the largest group of flies. Most crane fly species (75%) were found by Charles P. Alexander.\nThe adult only lives to mate and lay eggs: 10 to 15 days is all. In some species the adult does not eat at all.\nLarvae.\nMost of the crane fly's life is spent as a larva. Crane fly larvae are called leatherjackets or 'leatherjacket slugs' because of the way they move and eat roots (such as those of grass in lawns) and other vegetation. Some leatherjackets are aquatic. \nLeatherjackets can cause damage to plants. Because of this, crane flies are a pest of lawn grass in some areas. Invasive (European) crane flies (\"Tipula paludosa\") cause extensive damage to turfgrass. \nLarvae of crane flies are divided into segments. They have a distinct head capsule on the front. The segments on the rear portion of the larva (the abdominal segments) often have long fleshy projections (like tentacles). Scientists have never seen the larvae from most crane fly species: less than 2% of the larvae are known.\nAppearance.\nAdult crane flies have very long legs and a long, thin abdomen. It is very easy to accidentally break off their delicate legs when catching crane flies. Their thin legs and abdomen may help them to escape from birds who try to eat them. Females have larger abdomens in comparison to the males. The female abdomen also ends in a pointed ovipositor that looks a bit like a stinger. Crane flies cannot sting.\nThe wings are often held out from the body when the crane fly is not moving. When the wings are held out, the large halteres (balancers) can be seen behind the wings. Unlike mosquitoes, crane flies can not fly well. They will sometimes \"wobble\" when flying.\nCrane flies that live in temperate places, such as \"Tipula\" species, may grow as big as 60\u00a0mm in size. Tropical crane flies may grow to more than 100\u00a0mm. The giant crane fly (\"Holorusia rubiginosa\") that lives in the western United States can reach 38\u00a0mm (1-3/8\u00a0inches). There are also small crane flies, the size of mosquitoes. "}

His father was Joseph Chamberlain, an important politician. His half-brother (they had different mothers), Austen Chamberlain, also became a politician. Neville went to Rugby School. He became interested in botany (plants), birds and fishing. Neville also loved music and literature (reading). He studied metallurgy at Mason college, which Joseph Chamberlain later made part of the University of Birmingham. Later, he became an apprentice in an accounting company.\nNeville became a successful manager in a manufacturing company. He fell in love with Anne Cole, and married her in 1910. He was 40. In 1911, when he was 42, the people of Birmingham elected (chose) him to be part of the city council. On the council, he had the job of planning improving the city, the same kind of work his father had done. He planned new houses for poor people. In 1915 he became Lord Mayor of Birmingham, also as his father had done. In this job he did work to improve the city, including starting the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.\nMember of Parliament and Government.\nIn 1916, the prime minister, Lloyd George asked Chamberlain to become the director of conscription, forcing civilians to join the British Armys in World War I. Chamberlain and Lloyd-George often argued, and soon they did not like each other. Chamberlain left the job the next year. Instead, he entered the 1918 general election and became the Conservative Member of Parliament for Ladywood in Birmingham.\nIn 1923, the prime minister Andrew Bonar Law made Chamberlain the health minister. In this job, Chamberlain did more work to help poor people. For example, he made a law that connected rent prices to how good the building was. Chamberlain was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in charge of the economy, for a short time. After the 1924 general election, he became health minister again, where he stayed until the Conservatives lost the 1929 general election. Between 1924 and 1929, Chamberlain helped to make many new laws to help poor people, including a pensions system that helped to make Britain's welfare state after the Second World War.\nIn 1929, the Conservatives lost the general election, and Ramsay MacDonald became the new Labour prime minister. At this time, the Conservative party was trying to put tariffs (taxes) on imports to make trade in the British Empire stronger. Other people, including Lord Beaverbrook, a businessman who owned a lot of newspapers, disagreed, saying that trade should be free. Lord Beaverbrook started a new party to fight the Conservatives. Chamberlain fought Beaverbrook's part in an election, and won. This made him very popular in the Conservative party.\nAn economic crisis in 1931 led to another general election. After the election, Chamberlain became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this position he worked to cancel debts from the war. In 1932 he was able to start a tariff system. His father, Joseph Chamberlain had spent a long time working for a stronger British Empire when he was foreign secretary. He also worked hard for a tariff system, because he believed it would make the Empire economically independent. Neville was pleased to make his father's wishes come true.\nBy 1934, Chamberlain felt that the economy had recovered. However, at this time many important people, including Chamberlain's half-brother Austen and Winston Churchill were warning that Nazi Germany was rearming (building its military). These men said that Britain must rearm, too. In July 1934 the government told parliament that it had a plan to make the Royal Air Force much stronger.\nHowever, not everybody was happy to see an arms race (a competition with Germany to build a bigger military). The First World War was still in people's memories, and there was a pacifist feeling in the country. Chamberlain advised the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, to talk about rearmament in the 1935 general election. Baldwin was worried people would not vote for them if they talked about making the military stronger, so he talked about housing and unemployment instead.\nChamberlain worked hard with a slow economy. The government bought factories that were not being used, and spent money making them new again. This idea helped when the war began because Britain had the most modern equipment. When he announced (told the public about) his budget (plan for the economy) in 1935, the Labour party said he wanted war. Other people still said he was not doing enough to build the military. In 1936 the government announced plans to build the Royal Navy.\nPrime Minister.\nStanley Baldwin retired in 1937, and Chamberlain became the new prime minister on the 28th May. Chamberlain is mostly remembered for being the prime minister as Europe moved into the Second World War, but as prime minister he also made some important changes in Britain. He made laws that made working conditions better. He limited working hours for women and children. He introduced paid holiday for a large part of the population. He introduced laws to try to make the population healthier by exercising and medical inspection. Many other changes were planned, but the start of the war stopped these changes from happening.\nIn the 1930s, the Irish Taoiseach (similar to a prime minister) was \u00c9amon de Valera. de Valera worked to make a new constitution (set of laws) for Ireland. He wanted to make Ireland independent from Britain. Ireland had its own government, but Britain still controlled Northern Ireland, and had naval ports (called treaty ports) in Ireland. de Valera wanted this control to stop. Chamberlain wanted Ireland to support Britain if there was a war because he knew that without Irish help, defending the Atlantic Ocean would be difficult. Chamberlain and his Secretary of State, Malcolm MacDonald made an agreement to give the treaty ports back to Ireland, but hoped that British warships might use them in the war.\nMany Conservatives, including Winston Churchill, (who had made an agreement to have the treaty ports in 1921) disagreed strongly with this plan. This agreement, together with a plan to limit the number of Jewish people moving into Palestine (which was controlled by Britain at this time) made Chamberlain unpopular with many people.\nThe Munich Agreement.\nAlthough many people warned about the threat of Nazi Germany, Chamberlain chose ministers who agreed with him, and he wanted to avoid another war. Chamberlain, like many other people of the same age, were very worried about war. They believed that people like Adolf Hitler were in power because their people felt that their situation was unfair. German people felt that the Treaty of Versailles, an agreement made to end the First World War, was unfair. When Nazi Germany invaded (took control of) Austria and the Sudetenland (part of Czechoslovakia), Chamberlain tried to keep peace.\nIn September 1938, he flew to Munich to speak with Hitler. Together with the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Daladier, and the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, he made an agreement with Hitler. He was allowed to control the Sudetenland but had to agree not to use his military to solve future disputes (disagreements). When Chamberlain returned home, many people said he had done a wonderful job. Chamberlain was very pleased and said that the agreement meant \"peace for our time\".\nWar.\nIn March 1939, the German military moved in to control the rest of Czechoslovakia. This was against the Munich agreement. Chamberlain realised that his attempts to control Hitler had failed. He started to get Britain ready for war, using the new factories that had been built. Many new weapons were built, including the Supermarine Spitfire (a fighter aircraft), and radar. When the Germans invaded Poland on 1st September 1939, the British and the French talked together and decided to declare war on Germany (tell Germany war had started). Chamberlain spoke on the radio, and told the British people that war had begun.\nChamberlain made a new government, and included Winston Churchill. After the Germans invaded Norway in April 1940, the British sent a naval force to fight them. The plan was not a success, however, and parliament no longer supported Chamberlain. on 10 May 1940, Chamberlain resigned. Churchill became the prime minister, but Chamberlain stayed in the government. Later in May, Germany offered conditions for peace (things they wanted to stop fighting). Most of the government, including Chamberlain, wanted to agree with Germany and stop fighting. Churchill did not want to agree with Germany. He spoke with Chamberlain, and soon Chamberlain began to agree with Churchill. The result was that Britain stayed in the war.\nDeath.\nIn the summer of 1940, Chamberlain became sick. In July he had an operation on his stomach to treat cancer. He tried to return to work, but became too weak, and had to retire. He died on 9 November 1940 of bowel cancer. He was 71 years old. Winston Churchill spoke to parliament to tell them about Chamberlain's death. He praised Chamberlain as a good, honest man.\nLegacy.\nPeople disagree about Chamberlain. Some people think that his actions were wrong because he did not stop Hitler and the Nazis. Other people say that he gave Britain and France more time to get ready for war."}

It makes a parabola (a \"U\" shape) when graphed on a coordinate plane.\nWhen people work with quadratic equations, one of the most common things they do is to \"solve\" it. This means to find the points on a coordinate grid where the graphed equation crosses the x-axis, or the horizontal axis. These points are called the \"zeroes\", or \"roots\", of a function. In other words, to solve the equation means to find the value of \"x\" so that formula_1, where the coefficients, \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\", are all real numbers. There are different ways to find out the value of x. Plotting the function on a graph is one way. In the picture on the right, the function crosses the x-axis at the points formula_3 and formula_4.\nGraphing a quadratic equation makes it is very easy to find the roots, but it is not always convenient. So there are different ways to do this using maths.\nFactoring.\nSome quadratic equations, like formula_5, can be factorized. This equation can be written as formula_6, which produces two separate equations, formula_7 and formula_8. This is because when any of the two equations is equal to zero, the original equation is equal to zero because the two equations are multiplied together to form the quadratic equation. From this equation, it is easy to use algebra to find out what the value of \"x\" is. In the first of the two equations, formula_9 and in the second, formula_10. This means that these two values of \"x\" will make the whole quadratic equation equal to zero. The y-coordinate is equal to zero at these values of x, and so the coordinates formula_11 and formula_12 are the places where the graph of the function crosses the x-axis.\nCompleting the square.\nNot all quadratic equations can be factorized, such as formula_13. One of the ways to solve these kinds of equations is called \"completing the square\". This means to find some value for \"k\" below so that:formula_14 for some \"y\". Since formula_15 and formula_16 this means formula_17\nThere are five steps to solve a quadratic equation by completing the square:\nThis last value for \"x\" has two values: formula_28 and formula_29. These are the x-coordinates at the points where the y-coordinates are equal to zero and so the function crosses the x-axis.\nIt is also interesting to note that the vertex of the function, formula_30, can be found from the equation in step 3 above.\nThe quadratic formula.\nAlthough completing the square can be used to solve many quadratic equations, it does not work with every equation. There is a way to find the value of \"x\" that makes the equation true by replacing the values in a formula with the coefficients from the quadratic equation. This is called the \"quadratic formula\", which is:\nThe numbers represented by \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are the same as those in the original equation, . For this formula to work properly, \"a\" cannot be equal to 0 for the formula (but really, when \"a\" = 0 in the original equation, it is not quadratic since there is no x-squared term).\nThe factored form of this equation is , where \"s\" and \"t\" are the zeros, \"a\" is a constant, and \"y\" and the two values of \"x\" are ordered pairs which satisfy the equation.\nProof of the formula.\nThe quadratic formula can be found out, or proved, using the same \"completing the square\" method from above, only by using \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" instead of actual values and using algebra to find the value of \"x\". Here is how: \nUsing the quadratic formula.\nNow that the value of \"x\" has been found out, the values of \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are replaced with the corresponding coefficients from the original equation. For example, going back to the second example, formula_13 , it can be seen that the values are formula_41, formula_42, and formula_43. By putting these values into the quadratic formula and solving, the result is:\nformula_44. Solving the two square roots, the value of \"x\" can be either 1.148 or -0.348, which is the same as above.\nUnlike the other methods described above, the quadratic equation will work with every possible value for \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\", even if there are no \"real roots\", that is, places where the graph of the function touches the x-axis.\nThe value inside the square root, that is, formula_45, is known as the \"discriminant\". It can tell whether the roots are real or Imaginary. There are three cases:"}

These beetles are special in that most of them have bioluminescence, the ability to produce light. They are sometimes called 'lightning bugs' or 'forest stars'. There are about 2000 different species, most of which are nocturnal.\nAdults use flashes of light to attract mates. Also, firefly larvae flash their lights to warn predators that they are not a tasty meal. Many predators do not like the taste of firefly larvae.\nBody.\nA firefly is an insect, so it has an exoskeleton and three body parts. Much like an annual cicada, they are usually soft-bodied, often with the elytra (front wings) more leathery than in other beetles.\nA firefly may be brown or black with yellow and red marks.\nFunction.\nAll fireflies glow as larvae. Bioluminescence serves a different function in lampyrid larvae than it does in adults. It appears to be a warning signal to predators, since many firefly larvae contain chemicals that are distasteful or toxic.\nLight in adult beetles was originally thought to be used for similar warning purposes, but its main purpose is now thought to be mate selection. Fireflies are a classic example of an organism that uses bioluminescence for sexual selection. They have evolved a variety of ways to communicate with mates in courtships: steady glows, flashing, and the use of chemical signals unrelated to photic systems.\nHabitat.\nFireflies live in tropical climates in the United States, Latin America, Caribbean Island, and South East Asia. They also live east of Rocky Mountains. Fireflies like to live in damp areas and dry areas. Examples of damp areas are rain forests, streams, marshes, ponds and leaf piles. Examples of dry areas are backyards and meadows.\nMost species live in marshes or near water, because there their larvae have more than enough food."}

She is the richest woman in Japan and her manga is loved all over the world. She joined Gekiga Sonjuku college: a manga school run by Kazuo Koike, also a manga artist. With the school's help, she managed to make a \"doujinshi\" (self-published work mostly for beginners) manga artwork, for example, \"Bye-Bye Road\" and \"Star of Futile Dust\".\nBeginning of professional work (as a real job).\nShe first started with \"Those Selfish Aliens\" in 1978, followed by \"Time Warp Trouble\", \"Shake Your Buddha\", and \"The Golden Gods of Poverty\", published in Shonen Sunday - this place was to become the publisher of her most important works. Later in this year, she tried to work on \"Urusei Yatsura\" (Lamu, the invader girl), her first full series of books. This had some publishing problems, but even so, it became the most loved manga comedy in Japan.\nMajor and important works.\nIn 1980, she wrote a lot of books. The most important was \"Maison Ikkoku\" from 1980 to 1987. She finished both \"Urusei Yatsura\" (34 books) with \"Maison Ikkoku\" (15 books). After that she began a dark, story telling type of manga - the \"Mermaid Saga\", finished at 1994, with the story \"Mermaid's mask\". It is thought to be unfinished because it did not have a note to tell the reader it was ended. \"One-pound Gospel\" was her next book. It was nearly not finished because of the ending similar to \"Mermaid Saga\", with the last story done in 2001.\nAt late 1987, she began another major manga called \"Ranma \u00bd\". It ended in 1996 with 38 books altogether. During 1990s, she began \"InuYasha\". It was a magical story very similar to \"Mermaid Saga\". Rumiko Takahashi had said that she would make it up to 500 chapters and 50 books. That would make it the longest she has ever made for now.\nAnime based on her manga.\nIn 1981, Urusei Yatsura was the first work to become an anime. This series began showing on October 14 at the Japanese television by a studio called Kitty Animation. This had many different directors during the making of this anime. The most well known director was Mamoru Oshii. He also directed the second \"Urusei Yatsura\" movie, \"Beautiful Dreamer\". This is thought to be his best work for the anime. Kitty Animation also made the anime of \"Maison Ikkoku\" in 1986 (with 96 episodes and 4 Original Video Animation (OVA)s, which are animes made only on video but not on TV). It also made Ranma \u00bd in anime. Kitty Animation stopped because of problems, and Ranma \u00bd anime also stopped during episode 161.\nSunrise was the next studio to make animes out of Rumiko Takahashi's mangas. They made 167 episodes of \"InuYasha\" animes, started on 2000 and ending in 2004. As with \"Ranma \u00bd\", \"InuYasha\" did not finish. This was because the manga \"InuYasha\" was too long to continue in anime. The \"Mermaid Saga\" anime was made in 2003 for 13 series of the manga.\nThe later animes are from her short mangas: \"The Tragedy of P\", \"The Merchant of Romance\", \"Middle-Aged Teen\", \"Hidden In The Pottery\", \"Aberrant Family F\", \"As Long As You Are Here\", \"One Hundred Years of Love\", \"In Lieu of Thanks\", \"Living Room Lovesong\", \"House of Garbage\", \"One Day Dream\", \"Extra-Large Size Happiness\" and \"The Executive's Dog\".\nEffect of her works in Western world (outside Japan).\nTakahashi is still popular in Europe, mostly in France. Viz Media is the studio that translated most of the animes in English. At early 1990s, they began to translate \"Urusei Yatsura\" the anime. Because it was difficult to translate the Japanese way of life/culture and the confusing puns and wordplay, they stopped the series. \"Mermaid Saga\", \"Maison Ikkoku\" and \"Inuyasha\" could go on even so. \"Ranma \u00bd\" was popular for English-speakers. It was shown all over the world. Viz also showed \"InuYasha\" anime on Adult Swim, where it was very popular. \"InuYasha\" is the very popular even now. Even with many of her works having Japanese cultures that is difficult to understand in them, the believable characters in them and their feelings are easy to understand all over the world."}

In 1948, Momofuku Ando founded what was to become Nissin in Ikeda, Osaka, Japan. It was a small family-run company at first.\nOn August 25, 1958, at the age of 48, and after months of trial and error experimentation, Ando announced that he had finally perfected his flash-frying method and therefore invented the instant noodle. Called Chikin Ramen, after the original flavour, it was originally considered a luxury food item as it cost around six times that of traditional non-instant udon and soba noodles. Ando began sales of the Cup noodles on September 18, 1971. As prices dropped, ramen soon became a booming business. An estimated 70 billion servings were sold in 2004.\nIn 1964, looking for a way to promote the instant noodle industry, Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality, introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging and the \"fill to\" line. The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum is named after Ando.\nAndo was also the chairman of the International Ramen Manufacturers\u2019 Association.

The word 'demon' has different meanings all over the world, but often there is the idea that they are spirits that lived in a place, or went with a person. The word is also used for a type of computer program that does useful things in the background of a computer, but this use is not related to the religious meaning.\nIn religion, folklore, and mythology.\nA demon is usually thought to be a supernatural creature that is an evil spirit. Demons are often described as being summoned by someone, and then either being sent to do works of evil, or to create chaos. \"To demonize\" means to make someone appear evil. \nIn a few writings, there are also good demons, for example in stories by James Clerk Maxwell, Hesiod and Shakespeare. In Indo-European mythology and traditions of Iranian Avestan and Vedic, the idea of \"demons\" was there for many years. Ancient Egyptians thought of demons as \"monsters\" that ate souls of people when they went to the afterlife. In ancient Greek mythology, there are also \"daemons\" but they were thought to be invisible protectors that they believed protected them. In the book \"Northern Lights\" by Philip Pullman, a daemon is said to be a creature that everyone has as part of the body. So if it is far away from someone, that person would feel hurt.\n\"Monotheistic\" religions (that say there is one God) usually teach that demons are rebels and under God at all times. The English poet John Milton describes Satan as rebelling against God but losing, and being allowed to survive only by God's grace. In some \"polytheistic\" religions, demons are equal to gods. In Hinduism, the demon-goddess Kali represents destruction and thus from a human standpoint is \"bad\".\nWestern belief.\nThe \"grimoire\" (medieval book about magical beliefs) called \"Ars Goetia\", writes about 72 demons that a king has called and put in a bronze container sealed by magical symbols. The demons had to do whatever the king said. This book is all about spirits and demons, good and evil, that were called by magic. \nChristians believe that demons were angels that went bad. They fought against God, who won the battle with Michael (see Book of Revelation chapter 12) God sent the bad demons into a prison called Hell and they could not see God now for the punishment. Those demons are called the fallen angels. \nWestern beliefs about demons come from the Bible. The Bible does not mention the origin of demons. The idea that demons are fallen angels comes mostly from Augustine of Hippo.\nMiddle Eastern belief.\nIn the Greek New Testament and Hebrew Old Testament, demons are said to be bad. In Hebrew, demons are called \"\". In other Hebrew writings, they do not come from heaven, but came from another world and made much troubles. They gave diseases too. And they have a prince who is not God, but a demon. \nThe notion of demons derive from Zoroastrianism, an ancient Iranian religion. They called the demons \"deva\". Zorastrians believed that the Hindu deities (deva) were evil and caused injustice among humans. Therefore, they believed the deva are evil. Jews back when believed these deva were real, but the demons of their own religion.\nIn Islam, \"djinns\" are creatures that cannot be seen by people most of the time, made of fire by God (Allah), with special powers to help and harm people. \"Djinns\", like humans, have free will and must choose to serve and obey God (Allah). Like demons, djinns can possess people, but they are not only evil. \nThe \"deva\" were called \"div\" by Muslims. Unlike the djinns, div were not created to choose and have no free-will. Muslim scholars could only speculate about their origin. Some think they have been created by God, even before the djinns, others thought they are created a company for Satan.\nEastern Belief.\nIn Hinduism, demons are called \"asuras\". \"Patala\" is thought to be an underground place below the Earth, where humans live. \"Asura\" means supernatural beings that were good or bad. People who do evil and horrible things in their lives, by reincarnation, will turn into evil, ghost spirits called \"Vetalas, Pishachas, Bh\u016btas\". The most evil people reincarnate in hell as demons. In Japanese folklore, there are malevolent spirits called \"oni\" (\u9b3c), a Japanese word translatable as \"demon\" in English. \nNative American Belief.\nIn the traditional religion and folklore from the Native Americans in the United States and the Canada's First Nations, the Wendigo, a mythological monster believed to have a grotesque appearance and only eat human flesh, is widely considered to be a demon.\nAge and \"InuYasha\".\nIn \"InuYasha\", a fictional manga, yokai (Japanese for supernatural creatures and translated demon in English) cannot die easily and they age more slowly than humans.\nComputers.\nA daemon is a type of program found in computers running operating systems based on Unix like Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X. (In Windows these programs are usually called \"services\" instead.) It usually starts when the computer starts, and does useful things. Some daemons start other programs after waiting until a certain time of day, or wait for you to ask for a file from another computer. The term is a reference to Maxwell's Demon, not religion."}

A truck with about 440 pounds (200\u00a0kg) of high explosives crashed through the main gate of the Central Bank, a seaside building which managed most of the financial business of the country. As gunmen and security guards were shooting, the suicide bomber in the truck detonated the massive bomb, which badly damaged the bank and damaged eight other buildings nearby.\nThe explosion killed 90 people and injured 1,400 others. Most of these were ordinary citizens or civilians working in the small shops set up near the bank. This bombing was followed by the 1996 Dehiwala train bombing in July that killed 64 people.\nUntil 2006, the Central Bank bombing was the deadliest LTTE terrorist bombing."}

A short line (slightly longer than the note) is drawn parallel to the lines on the staff, and the note head is placed on that line or in the space below or above it.\nNotes with at least three or four ledger lines are rarely used for composing and arranging. It is easier to change the clef or use the \u201c8va\u201d sign (called \"ottava\" sign), which means the notes should be played an octave higher or lower than it is written, depending on whether the sign is above or below the staff."}
{"id": "47036", "revid": "1055293", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47036", "title": "Clef", "text": "A clef is a sign at the beginning of a staff of music which makes it possible for the player to work out what the notes are. The word \u201cclef\u201d is a French word meaning \u201ckey\u201d. The original Latin word is \u201cclavis\u201d. It is the \u201ckey\u201d to understanding which notes should be played.\nThe staff (or \u201cstave\u201d) consists of five lines across the page. The notes are placed on these lines and in these spaces. The staff is only large enough to cover one and a half octaves of music (a bit more with ledger lines). Therefore, different clefs are used for high music and for low music.\nTreble clef.\nThe treble clef is drawn by starting with a circle in the middle, then going up, round and straight down with a hook at the end. The second line of the staff (counting from the bottom) goes through the middle of the treble clef\u2019s circle. A note on this line is a G. This is why the treble clef is called a \u201cG clef\u201d.\nThe treble clef is used for high notes. The notes higher than Middle C can be written in the treble clef. In piano music the right hand is usually written in the treble clef. Music for instruments such as the violin, flute, oboe, recorder, trumpet and high singing voice are always written in the treble clef.\nAlto clef (Viola clef).\nThe alto clef is an example of a \u201cC clef\u201d. The middle of a C clef points to Middle C. In the alto clef Middle C is on the third line of the staff. Viola music is written in this clef, which is why it is also called the \u201cviola clef\u201d. Alto trombone players also need to be able to read the alto clef.\nTenor clef.\nThe tenor clef is another C clef. Middle C is on the fourth line up. Tenor trombone players need to be able to read the tenor clef. Cellists, Double bass players and bassoonists also need to read tenor clef when their music goes high.\nBass clef.\nThe bass clef is normally used for the left hand in piano music. Low instruments like the cello, double bass, and bassoon mostly read from the bass clef. It is an F clef because the two dots are on either side of the fourth line up which is an F below Middle C.\nChoice of clef.\nThe choice of clef used depends on the music. The music for a pianist\u2019s left hand may be written in the bass clef, and the right hand notes may be in the treble clef.\nIn choral music the sopranos and altos sing from the treble clef, the tenors usually sing from the treble clef but sounding an octave lower than written (shown by a small 8 below the clef), and the basses sing from the bass clef.\nfor low bass intoments"}

The tax is meant to put a penalty on short-term speculation in currencies. The proposed tax rate would be low, between 0.1% to 0.25%. \nOn August 15, 1971, Richard Nixon told that it would no longer be possible to change the US dollar to gold, so ended the Bretton Woods system. Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability, and proposed that such a system include a charge on foreign-exchange transactions. Professor Tobin later received a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1981.\nThe idea was nearly forgotten for more than 20 years. In 1997 Ignacio Ramonet, editor of \"Le Monde Diplomatique\", started the debate around the Tobin tax again with an editorial titled \"Disarming the markets\". Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax, which was named ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens). The tax has then become an issue of the antiglobalization movement and a matter of discussion not only behind academic institutions but even in the streets and in parliaments around the world, such as the UK and France. \nTobin tax projects in the world.\nSince one country acting alone would find it very difficult to introduce this tax, many argue it would be best done by an international institution. It has been proposed that having the United Nations manage a Tobin tax would solve this problem and would give the U.N. a large source of funding independent from donations by participating states. However, there have been initiatives of national dimension about the tax.\nThe Tobin tax idea was the subject of much discussion in Europe in the summer of 2001. On June 15, 2004, the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing the \"Spahn tax\" (a version of the Tobin tax proposed by Paul-Bernd Spahn). According to the legislation, Belgium will introduce the Tobin tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law."}

Quarterbacks are members of the offense, or attacking team. They line up directly behind the center, in the middle of the offensive team's line. A quarterback is usually the leader, and starts most plays. In addition, the quarterback gives commands to the other players before the start of a play. A quarterback will in most attacking plays throw the ball to a member of their team, ready to run to the end of the pitch. Quarterbacks may also run the ball themselves, as well as hand the ball to a runningback. These players are usually the faces of their respective teams. Some very notable players at this position in history are Tom Brady, Jim Kelly, and Peyton Manning.\nSpecial tactics.\nIf quarterbacks don't like the formation the defense is using, they may use an audible. An audible is a way for the quarterback to change the play at the line of scrimmage (where players line up to start a play). He changes what the play will be by shouting out things that his teammates will understand. An audible may be called if the quarterback sees how the defensive players are lined up and does not think that the play that has been called would be good against how the defense is lined up."}

This is usually done after an investigation of a crime or in stopping a crime from taking place. The term comes from Anglo-Norman. It is related to the French word \"arr\u00eat\", which means \"stop\".\nPolice and some other organisations are allowed to arrest people. In some places, normal people can arrest others (a \"citizen's arrest\"). For example, in England and Wales, a citizen's arrest can be made on someone who has committed a serious crime, though there are rules as to when and how this can be done.\nWhere the word comes from.\nThe word \"arrest\" comes from Anglo-Norman. It is taken from the French word \"arr\u00eat\". Arr\u00eat means 'to stop or stay'. There are many slang terms for being arrested in different countries. In British slang, the term \"nicked\" is often used to mean \"arrested\", and \"nick\" can also mean a police station. In the United States and France, \"collared\" is sometimes used. The term \"lifted\" is also used.\nThe way arrest is done.\nUnited States.\nWhen there is a good reason to think someone has committed a serious crime, the police usually handcuff an arrested person. The person will be taken to a police station or jail. There, they can be bailed or have their charge read out to them and asked how they plead. This is called an arraignment.\nIndia.\nIndian law says that arrests do not need to be formal. The arrest can be made by a normal citizen, a police officer or a Magistrate. The police officer needs to tell the person who is being arrested what they did wrong and that they can be let go on bail if the crime allows people to be bailed.\nWarnings.\nUnited States.\nA Miranda warning is only needed when a person has already been arrested is being questioned. This warning tells the person who has been arrested that they can be silent, can have a counsel with them, and warns them that whatever they say can be used against them. Police also must tell the person who has been arrested about their Miranda Rights.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom a person must be told that they are under arrest. They must also be told, in simple language that they can understand, the reasons for their arrest. A person must be 'cautioned' when they are arrested unless this can not be done, for example if the person being arrested is being violent or is drunk. The caution given in England and Wales is: You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.\nThis exact wording is not needed as long as the same information is given."}

Two months later, Yeltsin became a hero across Russia when he helped stop an attack on the government in Moscow. Later that year, the Soviet Union collapsed as Russia and all 14 other divisions made themselves independent. Yeltsin won support from the United States and Europe when he promised to bring capitalism and democracy to Russia, but the 1990s were difficult times for Russia and Yeltsin was an unpopular leader while President.\nIn 1993, the Russian Parliament tried to remove Yeltsin from power after he tried to hold early elections. The problem got so bad that Yeltsin ended up using tanks to attack the Russian Parliament building. After he stopped Parliament, Yeltsin ruled as a dictator for a few months until a new constitution was approved by voters.\nThroughout the rest of his time as President, Russia would be affected by many money problems, including inflation and corruption. Yeltsin decided to sell off many things the government had owned, such as oil and natural gas, and many government businesses, but these ended up falling into the hands of a small powerful group of billionaires, who became known as the oligarchs. In 1998, Russia suffered a large financial crisis. Yeltsin also started a war to stop the Chechnya part of Russia from breaking away.\nDespite these problems, Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996. His biggest opponent was a Communist, Gennady Zyuganov. Many Russians felt that if Zyuganov was elected, it would cause a civil war. But by the time he resigned on New Year's Eve in 1999, Yeltsin was so unpopular, that his approval rating was believed to be just 2%.\nLater career.\nYeltsin's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took over as President. This was only temporary, but Putin was then properly elected a few months later when an election was held to decide who should replace Yeltsin.\nPersonal life.\nYeltsin struggled with alcoholism while President. This often resulted in some strange behaviour when he visited other countries. During a visit to Berlin, he grabbed a stick and tried to conduct a military band. During a visit to Washington, he was found drunk outside the White House by members of the Secret Service. He also suffered from heart attacks.\nDeath.\nYeltsin died of congestive heart failure on April 23, 2007 in Moscow, Russia, aged 76. His funeral was held on April 25, 2007."}

Although not a clock in the traditional sense, the 2nd century BC Antikythera mechanism of ancient Greece was used to calculate the positions of the sun, moon, and stars at any given point by use of complex mechanical gears.

This is because music in the minor sounds melancholy or disturbed in comparison to the major because the third note of the scale is flattened (lowered by a semitone). In the harmonic series this minor third is the 7th harmonic which sounds dissonant against the fundamental (first note of the scale). This means that ending in the major gives a sense of relief after the tension of the minor. In a piece in A minor, for example, where the third note of the scale is C natural, in a Tierce de Picardie the final chord will include a C sharp, changing the chord from A minor to A major.\nBeethoven\u2019s \"Fifth Symphony\" is in C minor but the last movement is in the major. This is not a Tierce de Picardie in this case, as the term applies only when just the last chord alters. The term was introduced in 1767 by Rousseau in his \"Dictionnaire de musique\" (Dictionary of Music). \u201cTierce\u201d means \u201cthird\u201d, but no one knows why he called it \u201cPicardie\u201d (Picardy is an area in the north of France).\nBach used it fairly often in his music. The first movement of the \"Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra\" is a good example. In his \"Fantasia and Fugue in G minor BWV542\" the fugue ends with a Tierce de Picardie and, in some editions, the Fantasie as well. It is possible that Bach would have finished the Fantasie with a major chord only if he was playing it on its own (without the fugue), but we cannot be sure of this. Another good example of the Tierce de Picardie is the end of Cantata No. 82 \"Ich Habe Genug\", which is extremely effective. Another famous piece that ends in a Tierce de Picardie is Greensleeves."}

Flour that does not have a leavening agent is called all-purpose flour, or plain flour.\nFlour can also be made at home. Some people like to make flour at home because when flour comes from the factory, the outer shells of the grains have usually been removed. The outer shells have fiber which is needed for metabolism. Flour has many nutrients. You can even make flour out of things such as pumpkins, pumpkin seeds, brown and white rice, wheat, etc.\nHistory.\nIt was discovered around 6000 BC that wheat seeds could be crushed between simple millstones to make flour.

So a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is more dense when cooked.\nHistory.\nCookies where made in Ancient Greece around 1200 BC. Hard wafers have been made for as long as baking existed. They were very popular because they last a long time and are not fragile, but they were normally not sweet enough to be called cookies today.\nCookies were made at first in 7th century AD Persia, just after the use of sugar became common there.

Lots of people liked the new cookies, and Wakefield made an agreement in 1939 with Nestl\u00e9 to put her recipe on the chocolate bar's packaging. In return, Nestl\u00e9 gave Wakefield a lifetime supply of chocolate. \nAt first, Nestl\u00e9 put a small chopping tool in the chocolate bar package. In 1941 Nestl\u00e9 and one or more other chocolate bar companies started selling the chocolate in chip (or \"morsel\") form. The Nestl\u00e9 brand Toll House cookies is named after Toll House Inn."}

His father's name is \"Mehta kalu\" and mother's name is \"Mata tripta\" .The last Guru said that there would be no more Gurus after him and Sikhs would be taught by the Sikh holy book, which is called Guru Granth Sahib Ji. The word \"Guru\" means \"teacher\" in many Indian languages. His two son's are \"Sri Chand\" and \"Lakshmi Das\". \nBeside followers of Sikhism, Guru Nanak is considered holy by Punjabi Hindus and Sahajdhari Sindhis across the Indian subcontinent. Because of his close connection with Hazrat Sheikh Farid-ud-din Ganj Shakar, the Punjabi Sufi saint, Nanak Dev is also considered by many Muslims to be a Sufi, or adherent of Sufic tenets.\nHis main teaching to the world was written down to be \"devotion of thought and having good actions as the first of our jobs\".\nLife.\nGuru Nanak was born in Nankana Sahib, in Punjab. This is now part of Pakistan.\nWhen Guru Nanak was a child he refused the \"upanayana\" (holy thread) to initiate him into the Hindu religion. Later in his life he married Mata Sulakhani with whom he had two sons. They were called Sri Chand and Lakshmi Das. According to the Sikh religion, one day he was bathing in the river and god took him up to heaven. His family members were very worried as they had thought he died. After three days he returned with the message of god. He gave up his job to spread the message on how to be a good person.\nHe died in Kartarpur."}

The Romans called the people \"Etrusci\" or \"Tusci\". The Ancient Greeks called them \"Tyrrhenoi\" or \"Tyrrsenoi\". The Etruscans called themselves \"Rasenna\".\nThe Etruscan civilization began in pre-history. They lived in an area which included modern Tuscany, but was larger. At their height, they had three confederacies (like modern states): Etruria, Latinum and the Po Valley, and Campania. The Etruscans ruled Rome until 396 BC.\nLanguage.\nNot much is known about the Etruscan language. Not much of its writing survives. Most what survives is from engravings on tombstones. The Etruscans used an alphabet similar to those in Phoenicia and Greece.\nThe language is related to the Tyrrhenian language family and is not clearly related to other languages. Some Etruscan letters were used by the Romans in the Latin alphabet, which many languages use. Some Romans, such as Cicero, were fluent readers of Etruscan, but few of their writings survive. \nThe lack of texts makes knowledge of their society and culture depend on much later Roman sources. Politics was based on the small city and probably the family unit. In their heyday, the Etruscan elite became rich by trade with the Celtic world to the north and the Greeks to the south, and filled their large family tombs with imported luxuries. Ancient Greece had a huge influence on their art and architecture, and Greek mythology was evidently very familiar to them.\nEtruscan does not survive in any great literary works, unlike Greek and Latin. An Etruscan religious literature existed, and evidence suggests that there was a body of historical literature and drama as well. For example, the name of a playwright, Volnius, is known. He wrote the \"Tuscan tragedies\".\u00a0Although there is no evidence of notation, it is possible that Etruscan music had a written form.\nHistory.\nThe Etruscans mined metals like copper and iron. They became rich and powerful and travelled around the Mediterranean Sea. The Etruscans began to lose power in the 5th century BC. The Romans began conquering parts of Etruscan land. By the beginning of the 1st century BC, the Etruscans had been entirely defeated.\nArt.\nEtruscan art included wall paintings, metalwork and sculpture in terracotta. Sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but few large examples have survived because bronze was valuable and so was often recycled.\nEtruscan religion.\nEtruscan religion was a set of stories, beliefs, and religious practices. These came from the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture. They were heavily influenced by the mythology of ancient Greece and Phoenicia. They had similarities to Roman mythology and religion. As the Etruscan civilization was assimilated into the Roman Republic in the 4th century BC, the Etruscan religion and mythology were partially absorbed. There was a Roman tendency to absorb local gods and customs of conquered lands."}

It is bordered by Korea to the west, Russia to the north and Japan to the east and south.\nSouth Korea calls it the East Sea, while North Korea calls it the East Sea of Korea.\nGeography.\nThe Sea of Japan is a sea in the north-western edge of the Pacific Ocean. It is separated from the ocean by the Japanese Archipelago, including Sakhalin, Hokkaid\u014d and Honsh\u016b. It is surrounded by these islands and the Eurasian Continent. It covers 978,000 square km. The average depth is 1,667 meters. The depth of the deepest point is 3,742 meters. Five (or Six) narrow channels of water link the Sea of Japan and other seas: the Strait of Tartary and La P\u00e9rouse Strait with the Sea of Okhotsk; the Tsugaru Strait with the Pacific Ocean; the Kanmon Straits with the Seto Inland Sea; the Busan and Tsushima Strait with the East China Sea. \nThe Sea of Japan has a shallow area in its center, called the Yamato Bank. Water here is less than 1,000 meters deep. It has three major sea basins: the Yamato Basin in the southeast, the Japan Basin in the north, and the Tsushima Basin in the southwest. These three surround the Yamato Bank counterclockwise.\nThe structure of the Sea of Japan can be divided into two layers: the surface water layer is about 300 meters deep, and the deep sea layer is below this. Currents in the surface layer move in the counterclockwise direction. One of them is the Tsushima Current, which is a warm current from the Korean Straits to the north-east direction along the shore of the Japanese Archipelago and mainly considered to be the branch of the Kuroshio Current. The other is the Liman Current, which is a cold current from the Strait of Tartary to the south-west direction along the shore of the Eurasian continent.\nIn contrast to the surface water, the deep sea water does not move as much because the five straits in and out are narrow and shallow. The deep sea water of the Sea of Japan tends to stay longer in the bottom of the sea than other deep sea water. The deep sea water is about eighty percent of the water in this sea.\nName.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) decided to call this area the \"Sea of Japan\" in 1929.\nSince 1992, South Korea has asked the world to use the names \"East Sea\" or \"Sea of Korea\" instead of \"Sea of Japan\".\nSouth Korea argues that this sea has been called \"East Sea\" since early times. It is also a Korean belief that the name \"East Sea\" was eliminated from maps of the world in the early 20th century while South Korea was under the rule of Japan.\nHowever, Japan says that the name \"Sea of Japan\" has been used more widely than \"East Sea\" in Europe and America since before the 18th century. Japan also argues that if there were no Japan, there would be no sea.\nNow, most international maps and documents use the name Sea of Japan only. However, in some cases, the name East Sea is included along with the name Sea of Japan."}

Lawns are cut to a low, even height using a lawnmower. Lawns are used for aesthetic (for their beauty) and recreational purposes. Other words used to describe them are turf, pitch, field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent. They are often found around buildings, making them a type of yard.\nLawns are generally composed only of grass species, subject to weed and pest control, maintained in green colour, and are regularly maintained to ensure an acceptable length. Lawns are used around, apartments, houses, commercial buildings and offices. Approximately 80% of all homes in the United States have grass lawns. This has resulted in a $40 billion per year industry, with American grass lawns using more water than is used to grow all the wheat and corn in the United States.\u00a0 In that sense, by water consumption, grass is the United States\u2019 leading \u201ccrop\u201d by far, with the Environmental Protection Agency estimating that about 1/3 of all public water is used to water grass, with that number rising as high as 70% in some of the more dry regions of the United States.\nThe earliest mention of lawns comes from France during the 1500s. Lawns (as opposed to fields) found their way to England in the 1700s. One acre (0.4 hectare) of lawn would take three gardeners all day to mow using a tool called a scythe. Two centuries later, one person with a lawnmower could do it in an afternoon.\nHistory.\nIn the 16th Century Renaissance, lawns were deliberately cultivated by the wealthy in both France and England, though they were more likely planted with chamomile or thyme than with grass. Both of these ground covers make excellent alternatives to grass in modern lawns.\nClosely shorn grass lawns first emerged in 17th century England at the homes of large, wealthy landowners. While sheep were still grazed on many such park-lands, landowners increasingly depended on human labor to tend the grass closest to their homes. Only the rich could afford to hire the many hands needed to scythe and weed the grass, so a lawn was a mark of wealth and status.\nLawns around the world.\nIn many parts of the United States lawn care is an important part of home maintenance. a poorly kept up lawn can hurt the value of a home. Families do many things on their lawn. Neighborhood cookouts, birthday parties and outdoor games are just some of the uses.\nWorld Famous Lawns include:"}

She did research on radioactivity. She was also the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She was the first woman professor at the University of Paris. She was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. She received a Nobel Prize in physics for her research on uncontrolled radiation, which was discovered by Henri Becquerel.\nShe died because of too much exposure to radiation in her laboratory because she had no protection against the effects of radiation.\nEarly life.\nCurie was born on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw, Poland. She lived there until she was 22. Her original name was Maria. Marie Curie was the fifth child in her family. At the age of ten, her sister Zofia died. Her mother died two years later. Her father was a math teacher. He died when she was 11. As a young girl, she was interested in physics. She was top of her high school class. She graduated at 15. Marie became a teacher so she could earn money to go to school in Paris, France. She also went to an unaccredited college in Poland. Eventually, she left Poland and went to France under the name \u201cMarie\" after one of her big sisters gave her the chance. In Paris, she earned higher degrees and did her important scientific work. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw.\nScientific career.\nCurie did many things. She and her husband created a theory of \"radioactivity\" (a term made by her and her husband Pierre Curie). They found different ways to separate radioactive isotopes and discovered two new elements: radium and polonium. The term polonium was named after Poland, her home country. She used her own studies in radioactivity to develop a new treatment for cancer. These treatments used the radioactive isotopes. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize. She was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes.\nDiscovery of radium.\nCurie discovered radium. It is one of the most radioactive and dangerous metals. She shared this discovery with Pierre Curie and Gustave Bemont. The three found radium in 1898. They discovered it when using a uranium ore. It gave off a lot of radiation. They decided that it was coming from more than uranium. The group found radium in the uranium. Radium is now used for many different things. For example, doctors used to use it to kill cancer cells. Radium was found in paint and watches. Many workers who made radium-containing products developed bone cancer. \nPersonal life.\nEven though Curie became a French\u00a0citizen, Curie never lost her Polish\u00a0identity. She graduated first in her class in 1893. One year later she earned a master's degree in mathematics. Later, she met her husband, Pierre, at the Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry. They were married in July 1895 after only one year. They also started to work together on scientific discoveries. Marie and Pierre had their first daughter, Irene, in 1897. Their second daughter, Eve, was born in 1904. Pierre died on April 19, 1906, after he was hit by a horse-drawn wagon.\nFund raising.\nAfter the war, Marie started to raise money for a hospital. The hospital raised money for radiation research. She was invited to tour the United States to recommend and speed up her project. She sailed for the United States in 1921. She collected enough money and equipment for a new laboratory. She then started speaking at meetings to raise more money and became a celebrity. She also supported world peace by serving on the council of the League of Nations.\nDeath.\nNear the 1920s, Curie and many of her colleagues began to suffer from symptoms of cancer. Curie began to lose her sight. Cataract surgeries to try to bring back her sight did not help. Curie knew that the element (radium) she discovered might have been causing the symptoms, but she did not want to admit it to herself or others. In the early 1930s, Curie\u2019s health started to quickly get worse. Doctors diagnosed her with pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is a blood anemia that happens when someone is overly exposed to radiation. The doctors didn\u2019t tell the public or Curie herself what was going on. On July 4, 1934, at 66 years old, she died in a Sanitorium at the French Alps. She was then buried next to her husband in Sceaux, France. Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist best known for her work on radioactivity; however, she also discovered the elements polonium and radium. She was awarded two Nobel Prizes \u2014 one in physics which she won jointly with her husband and Henri Becquerel, and another in chemistry \u2014 and was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. She is still one of only four people (along with Linus Pauling, John Bardeen and Frederick Sanger) to accomplish that feat. Curie is responsible for establishing the theory of radioactivity, but unfortunately she unwittingly also discovered the fatal effect radioactivity can have on your health; she died on July 4, 1934, of aplastic anemia caused by radiation exposure."}

In this line of work the stuntman (or woman) is paid to do those actions that are deemed too dangerous for the regular actor to perform, these include jumping from a height, falling down, being in a car crash, or pretending to fight with weapons such as swords or knives. These stunts are usually presented as a small feature within a larger production.\nAction movies, war movies, martial arts movies, and crime television shows use many stunt performers to do the dangerous actions depicted in the movies or shows. Jackie Chan and the Blue Angels are examples of stunt performers who perform this kind of work.\nThere are, however, other stunt performers that present dangerous stunts to a live audience rather than as part of a larger story. Sometimes these are as standalone effects and sometimes as a feature within a larger stunt show. Escape artists, sword swallowers and other circus and sideshow acts are an example of this. These types of stunt performers can be found scattered throughout history with one of the most famous from the last Century being escape artist Harry Houdini.\nWorking as a stuntman.\nStunt work is dangerous regardless of whether you work in movie, television or within a live stunt show. Stuntmen are often hurt during the stunts they perform and in some cases stuntmen have even been killed.\nStunt work is not steady work. Stuntmen who work in movie are only employed on a movie-by-movie basis, sometimes they are needed for a number of months if they are lucky to double for the lead actor but could quite easily only be needed for a single stunt that is filmed over the space of a day or two.\nWithin the live stunt industry work is very seasonal. A stuntman can be working long hours during the summer months, often seven days a week, but not at all during the winter period.\nStuntmen who perform for movie and television often benefit from having a large safety crew present, which is in stark contrast to those who perform within live shows who often work alone and are responsible for all aspects of the stunt they perform. \nStuntmen also have to travel to many different regions or countries to get work. For people who like to travel, this may be an advantage. However, it can also make it hard to see friends and relatives, if you are away from home.\nBecoming a stuntman.\nTo become a stuntman, some people go to a stuntman school. There are stuntman schools in California and Florida, where professional stuntmen teach people how to do stunts. Most people do not go to school to become stuntmen, though. People learn the skills from other more experienced stuntmen. \nWhen a stuntman first begins working as a stuntman, they do not make much money. Once a stuntman has experience, they can ask for more money. In many countries, stuntmen have to join a union to work on movie or television show productions, and pay dues (payments) to the union. There are more men working as stuntmen than women. \nUsually, a stuntman within movie and television does not work as a stuntman after they become 40 years old. However those who work live stunt shows continue to do so until very late in life. Kondini continues to work as a sword swallower and escape artist despite being in his 70s. Some experienced stuntmen become stunt coordinators or consultants, who plan and devise the stunts performed in TV shows and movies.\nRelated concepts.\nAnother job for men or women in the television or movie production industry where people replace the actors is the job of body double. When a movie has a scene with a love scene or a nudity scene that the actor does not want to do, the movie or television director may hire a man or a woman to be a body double. The man or woman pretends to be the actor for a short period, so that the love scene or nudity scene can be filmed."}

This meant that the computer could confuse the year 2000 with the year 1900, because both would be written as 00. People started fearing that date-related processing would happen incorrectly for dates and times after December 31 1999. It caused concerns that many industries (such as electricity or financial) and government functions would stop working at exactly midnight, January 1 2000. People were panicked by press coverage and media speculation, as well as corporate and government reports. Companies and organisations around the world had to check and upgrade their computer systems to avoid the bug. The preparation for Y2K had a significant effect on the computer industry.

An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances. There are three levels at which biological variety can been identified:\nThreats.\nThe idea can be used for tackling practical problems in conservation, for example:"}

He formed a local rock group called The Panthers in 1961. This group became The Iveys in 1965. The band was relocated to London by The Mojos manager, Bill Collins, in 1966, and they continued to perform for three years throughout the United Kingdom. Ham especially took to songwriting and Ray Davies of The Kinks took initial interest in producing his group. In 1968, The Iveys came to the attention of Mal Evans (The Beatles personal assistant) and were eventually signed to the Beatles' Apple label after approval from all four Beatles, who were most impressed by dozens of demos recorded at home, mostly by Pete.\nThe Iveys changed their name to Badfinger with the single release of \"Come And Get It,\" a song written by Paul McCartney, which became a worldwide Top Ten hit. Ham's hard work paid off eventually as his song \"No Matter What\" became another worldwide Top Ten hit record in late 1970 . He followed up writing two more huge hits released in 1972, \"Day After Day\" and \"Baby Blue\" But the peak came with his co-written song \"Without You\" - a worldwide No. 1 hit as covered by Harry Nilsson in 1972. The song has since become one of the all-time ballad standards as covered by hundreds of singers including Mariah Carey and Clay Aiken. Ham was also used as a musician on Beatles solo records such as the \"All Things Must Pass\" LP by George Harrison and the single \"It Don't Come Easy\" by Ringo Starr."}

It is a part of the Richemont group since 1996. The brand's watch factory is based in Geneva. Vacheron Constantin opened 15 boutiques and 500 shops in 80 countries of the world. Vacheron Constantin is one of the oldest watchmakers. \nHistory.\n18th century.\nJean-Marc Vacheron opened the first workshop in Geneva, Switzerland in 1755. In 1770 the company introduced the first complication (an additional function of a watch besides showing hours and minutes). \nThe son of Jean-Marc Vacheron, Abraham, became the head of the family business in 1785.\n19th century.\nIn 1810, Jacques-Barth\u00e9lemy, the grandson of the founder continued the business. He controlled the company's exports of watches to France and Italy. \nIn 1819 Francois Constantinin became the partner of Vacheron. The name of the company became \u2013 \"Vacheron &amp; Constantin\". Francois Constantin traveled a lot and opened new markets for the company. The main market was North America. Francois wrote the company's motto - Do better if possible and that is always possible. It is kept till the present day.\nIn 1839 Georges-Auguste Leschot joined \"Vacheron &amp; Constantin\". He headed the manufacturing process. Leschot's inventions brought great success to the company and watchmaking in general. Leschot invented a device that made possible mechanical production of some watch parts. It helped the company leave behind other watchmakers.\nAfter Francois Constantin and Jacques-Barth\u00e9lemy Vacheron died, the company was headed by their heirs. Since 1862 Vacheron Constantin explores the field of non-magnetic materials. In 1885, it produced the first anti-magnetic watch. The watch could resist magnetic fields. \nIn 1877 the company officially changed the name for \"Vacheron &amp; Constantin, Fabricants, Geneve\". The same year the company chose its symbol - the Maltese cross.In 1887, Vacheron Constantin became a stock company. \n20th century.\nThe first Vacheron Constantin boutique was opened in Geneva in 1906. Today the store is situated on Quai de l\u2019Ile. Charles Constantin headed the company in 1936. He led it through the Great Depression period. For the first time since 1850s a Constantin family member became the president of the company. When the World War II was over, the company got back its firm position on the watch market.\nThe history of Vacheron Constantin saw a lot of innovations. The brand's classic Patrimony line was started with the thinnest watch. Its case was only 5.25mm thick. In 1979 Vacheron Constantin created the most expensive wristwatch with initial price of $5 million. The watch named Kallista had 118 diamonds. Today its price is $11 million. \nRecent years.\nAt present day Vacheron Constantin produces about 20,000 watches every year. In 2003 Vacheron Constantin presented a new sports watch line - Overseas. In 2005 the company introduced a new Eg\u00e9rie collection. The collection included women's watches for the first time.\nIn 2005, Juan Carlos Torres became the Chief of the Vacheron Constantin Company. The same year Vacheron Constantin produced the most complicated wristwatch - Tour de I'lle. The watch consisted of 834 parts and had 16 complications (additional functions). Its price reached over $1 million. In 2006 the company opened a new main office in Genevan Plan-les-Ouates."}

Thermoplastic materials can be cooled and heated several times without any change in their chemical or mechanical properties. When thermoplastics are heated to their melting point, they melt to a liquid. They freeze to a glassy state when cooled below their glass transition temperature. \nThermoplastic materials have many features. Some products made from thermoplastic materials are used for electronic applications. They protect against electrostatic discharge and radio frequency interference. Thermoplastics are one of the main two types of plastics.\nThermoplastic can be moulded into any shape. Thermoplastics differ from thermosetting polymers. Thermosets form irreversible chemical bonds during the curing process. \nMain types of thermoplastics.\nPET (polyethylene terephthalate) :- Light, rigid or semi-rigid, naturally transparent or colorless, PET is an excellent moisture and gas barrier and is resistant to impacts. It is one of the most easily recyclable plastics and is used to produce bottles, bags and synthetic fibers for clothing.\nHDPE (high-density polyethylene) :- HDPE is translucent, strong and easy to process, resistant to impacts and non-toxic. It is used to make bottles, tanks, bins and containers for transport.\nLDPE (low-density polyethylene) :- LDPE can be translucent or transparent. Suitable for contact with food, it is the lightest and most heat-sensitive plastic. It is used for packaging, bags, sacks, cable coatings, containers, pipes and toys. \nPVC (polyvinyl chloride) :- PVC is a very versatile plastic, resistant to wear and tear, chemical and atmospheric agents and fire. It is used in the paper industry and for packaging, food containers, credit cards, furnishings, clothing and toys.\nPP (polypropylene) :- Transparent, light and strong, this material can be used as both a plastic and a fiber. Easily colored, it does not absorb water. It is used to make textile fibers, couplings, containers for transport, furniture, carpets, ropes and food containers.\nPS (polystyrene or styrofoam) :- One of the most important thermoplastic materials, it is transparent, hard and inflammable, very bright and inert against many corrosive agents. It can be given shiny or opaque colors. Polystyrene is commonly used to replace glass, aluminum and wood because it is cheaper. It can also be used in packaging materials (including for foods), containers, boxes, lamps, disposable objects, cups and toys."}

Ayala is famous for making songs in both English and Spanish, but Spanish is used more than English.\nBiography.\nDuring his childhood, Ram\u00f3n grew up with the influence of his family musician, including those of his father and some members of his mother's family. At twelve, he began singing songs inspired by reggae and hip-hop.\nRam\u00f3n wanted to become a professional baseball player, he will have to give up this goal after being shot in a neighborhood brawl when he was seventeen. He received two balls of AK-47, one touched his arm and the other touched him on the level of the right thigh, where he was wounded for life. After this incident, he will take a closer look at the underground rap movement, which was nascent at the time.\nCareer.\nHe began his career flirting with hip-hop and with Latin rhythms like dancehall, but we can say that his greatest hits will come when he begins to perform and produce his Latin hip-hop songs. He will be one of the first artists to perform internationally in reggaeton music.\nRam\u00f3n invested in the world of reggaeton for thirteen years before experiencing success. He first recorded with DJ Playero, of which he is the featured artist in a production called Playero 37, which will be released in 1992. He has also partnered with artists such as Laurena Snoop Dogg, Nicky Jam, Pitbull, Mey Vidal , DJ Blass, Eric DJ, Eliel, Nas, Tony Touch or members of the G-Unit, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck.\nHis album Barrio Fino is an essential music to the style: it comes from the deepest of his roots of his life but also his personal experience, in the neighborhoods or residential areas of Puerto Rico. The first excerpts from this album are titled Gasolina, King Daddy and No me dejes solo featuring Wisin y Yandel.\nSongs.\nHis song, Impacto, released on of 2007, appears in the San Juan Sounds radio station's playlist of Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto IV and games.\nIn the Grand Theft Auto IV video game, Daddy Yankee lends his voice to the San Juan Sounds station where he acts as a DJ of the reggaeton radio station; the song \"Impacto\" also appears. This is an open-world action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North.\nDaddy Yankee's latest off-music project was the release of his Trilogy game, a 3D video game based on Tower Defense games. The game was successfully presented at the New York Comic Con and the 3D action video game impressed young and old alike. It was released on November 29, 2013 and also includes Ayala songs such as \"Gasolina\" and \"Limbo\".\nIn 2017, Daddy Yankee forms an amazing duet with Despacito in collaboration with Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi, who is a hit in the world.\nAs an actor he also plays in American movies and series of commemoration Love, Glory and Beauty.\nOn April 28, 2016, Daddy Yankee received the Industry Leader Award at the 2016 Latin Billboard Awards.\nAfter a long feud with Don Omar for ten years for the title \"King of Reggaeton\", Daddy Yankee and Don Omar announced in early 2016 at a press conference that they would perform together on stage in a series of concerts entitled The Kingdom World Tour. The announcement of the tour left many fans in disbelief because it sold in minutes in major cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles, New York. The concerts were structured like a boxing match, where the two artists were able to exchange musical tours, and fans voted for their winner in each city via an application designed for the event. \"Two kings, one throne,\" said Pina Records founder Rafael Pina, who had a well-established relationship with both artists and who also came up with the concept of the tour. Speaking of the tour and his rivalry with Daddy Yankee, Don Omar said, \"Let me clarify: I'm not his best friend, and he's not my best friend, but we respect each other. 'to be the best is what drove us to be better'.\nDespacito.\nIn 2017, Daddy Yankee, in collaboration with Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi, released the single \"Despacito\". It became the first Spanish-language song to reach number 1 of the Billboard Hot 100 since the song \"Macarena\" in 1996. The single has been a worldwide success. The official video of \"Despacito\" on YouTube was seen the billion times on April 20, 2017 after 97 days, becoming the second fastest video of the site to reach the milestone behind \"Hello\" Adele.

It was built by Stakotra, a subcontractor to Intamin. Built in 2005 to be the worlds tallest and fastest roller coaster Kingda Ka is one of only two strata coasters in the world. Kingda Ka held the record for the worlds fastest roller coaster until the completion of Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Kingda Ka goes up and can go . It first opened on May 21, 2005. To get up 456 feet, the train is launched by a machine to 128 miles per hour in 3 seconds. The train goes up the tower, and back down. At the bottom the train goes over a hill while it is slowing down. Soon it is going slow enough to be able to arrive safely back where it started. The ride lasts 28 seconds from the time it is launched.\nHistory.\nIn the past, Kingda Ka has been struck by lightning and shut down for almost a whole year. The launch cable snapped once and the ride was shut down for a while. Something happened to the braking fins so they shut down the ride. It also can get shut down by weather. The train is made so that if it rolls back it gets placed back to be launched. This happens when the hydraulic launch system does not get enough power to get over the hill or the brakes on the top off the hill stop you too much.\nStory.\nKingda Ka is named for a 500-pound mythical tiger. A tiger in the safari was named after the roller coaster. It is surrounded by bamboo to make it look more real. It also plays music.\nFeatures.\nThe ride has 4 trains with 5 cars. They are 9 rows in each car that can hold 18 people and there are 2 people in each row. Each seat has shoulder harnesses and buckles that keep the shoulder harness down to make sure passengers are safe. At the top, passengers are weightless for a second, and after riders enjoy a beautiful view, it is followed by a drop.\nRestrictions.\nPassengers must be 4\u00b47 to ride Kingda Ka.\nProblems.\nThe train may sometimes experience a rollback after it is launched. A rollback happens when the train doesn't make it to the top of the hill and rolls back down the track. The launch track has magnetic brakes so that the train doesn't go back to the station."}

(Unlike an LED it does not produce its own light). The panel is made up of several blocks, and each block can be in any shape. Each block is filled with liquid crystals that can be made clear or solid, by changing the electric current to that block. Liquid crystal displays are often abbreviated LCDs. \nLiquid crystal displays are often used in battery-powered devices, such as digital watches, because they use very little electricity. They are also used for flat screen TV's. Many LCDs work well by themselves when there is other light around (like in a lit room, or outside in daylight). For smartphones, computer monitor, TV's and some other purposes, a back-light is built into the product. This is an LED or Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light (CCFL).\nConstruction.\nThe LCD uses technology called electro-optical modulation. This means it uses electricity to change how much light passes through it.\nEach pixel (block) of an LCD is made of a thin layer of molecules between two electrodes and two polarizing filters. The electrodes provide electric power to the liquid crystal layer, and don't block the light. Light travels with 'polarity' or direction, and a polarizing filter only lets light with one kind of polarity to go through it, like trying to slide a ruler through a narrow opening. Only when the ruler is lined up right, will it fit. These two filters are perpendicular to one another, so the narrow openings are in different directions. This means that without the liquid crystals between them, they would block all light from passing through \u2013 whatever light gets through the first filter will not fit through the second filter.\nThe layer of liquid crystals between the two filters can 'twist' the light so that the polarity changes. This means the light can then pass through both filters, and the pixel appears clear. When giving an electric current to the liquid crystals, the molecules will untwist and will not change the light. The filters then block the light and the pixel appears dark. \nWhen a large number of pixels are needed in a display, it becomes difficult to have enough wires and electrodes to control each pixel and still have a clean display. Instead, the display is \"multiplexed\". In a multiplexed display, electrodes on one side of the display are grouped and wired together (usually in columns). On the other side, the electrodes are also grouped (typically in rows), with each group getting a voltage sink. By turning on one row and one column, each pixel can be controlled one at a time."}

Body language is about using behaviour to communicate. Both people and animals use this form of communication. Part of this behaviour is done subconsciously. It is therefore different from communicating using sign language, for example. Communication using sign language is intentional, body language is not.\nThe forms of behaviour used in body language include body posture, gestures, facial expressions, and eye movements.\nBody language may provide clues as to the attitude or state of mind of a person. For example, it may indicate aggression, attentiveness, boredom, a relaxed state, pleasure, amusement, and intoxication.\nBody language is significant to communication and relationships. It is relevant to management and leadership in business and also in places where it can be observed by many people. It can also be relevant to some outside of the workplace. It is commonly helpful in dating, mating, in family settings, and parenting. Although body language is non-verbal or non-spoken, it can reveal much about your feelings and meaning to others and how others reveal their feelings toward you. Body language signals happen on both a conscious and unconscious level.\nThe Vocabulary Of Body Language.\nBody language is less exact than spoken language, so you have to be careful about how you interpret it. A certain movement or facial expression may be quite meaningful, or it may mean nothing at all. As a starting point, the following sections provide you with some common body language terms and their generally-accepted meanings.\nPositive Body Language.\nPositive body language is generally quite reliable as an indicator of a person's feelings. It signals interest in the other person and in the conversation.\nRelaxed posture - Comfortably seated, relaxed breathing, no visible stiffness or abrupt movements. These indicate no major barriers to communication.\nArms relaxed - Uncrossed arms and hands open (palms up or otherwise visible to the other person) are signs of openness.\nGood eye contact - Looking in the other person's eyes, particularly when they are speaking, indicates interest in that person. Proper eye contact involves looking away occasionally to avoid staring.\nNodding agreement - When nods are used to punctuate key things the other person has said, they signal agreement, interest and understanding. However, continual unconscious bobbing of the head usually indicates that the listener is tuning out.\nTaking notes - Shows interest and involvement, particularly if notes are on what the other person is saying. \nSmiling/adding humour - This is a very positive sign. It signals a warm personal relationship. \nLeaning closer - Reducing the distance between two people, particularly when the other person is speaking. Indicates interest is up and barriers are down. \nGesturing warmly - Talking with hands, particularly with palms open, indicates involvement in the conversation and openness to the other person.\nFor all of these positive gestures, moderation is the rule. When they are exaggerated, they can become more negative than positive.\nNegative Body Language.\nNegative body language is somewhat less reliable as an indicator of the person's comfort with the current conversation than positive body language. Actions that are generally considered negative may just be a matter of comfort for this person, may indicate that the person is tired, or may result from other matters that are weighing on this person's mind. \nBody tense - Stiffness, wrinkled brow, jerky body motion, hands clasped in front or palms down on the table. These can indicate concern with the topic or dealing with the other person\nArms folded in front - Creates a barrier; can express resistance to what is being said. \nHand on face - A hand over one's mouth is a closed gesture. Leaning on one's elbow with the chin in the hand can communicate boredom. \nFidgeting - Moving around a lot, playing with things and drumming fingers are usually a sign of boredom, nervousness or impatience.\nArms behind head, leaning back - In a well-established relationship this can be a relaxed gesture. In a new relationship, it is often used to express a desire for control or power.\nYawning - Boredom, confusion. The other person is talking too much or in too much technical detail.\nImpatience - Trying to interrupt what the other person is saying, opening one's mouth frequently as if to speak.\nDistraction - Eyes flicking about, blank stares, flipping through literature without really reading it, looking at others in the office, looking at the person's body or clothing.\nLeaning away - Avoiding moving closer, even when something is handed to the person, is strongly negative. \nNegative facial expressions - These include shaking head, eyes narrowed, scowling, frowning"}

It can involve violating copyright laws. College students who are caught plagiarizing can be expelled from school. It can permanently damage a student's reputation. Writers who plagiarize commit serious legal and ethical violations. \nLegal issues.\nMany cases of plagiarism, especially in schools, can lead to internal punishment. Certain people have been punished in a legal court for plagiarism, mostly due to copyright claims. Court cases include:\nAny work created in the USA after 1st. Mar 1989 is automatically protected by copyright, even if there is no copyright notice attached to the work. The defendant could sue for any copying of this kind of intellectual property.\nAvoiding plagiarism.\nIt is usually not enough to know what plagiarism is, students must also know how to avoid plagiarism. Writers are as responsible for intentional plagiarism as they are for accidental plagiarism. It is important to cite sources while doing research. Putting this off until later can cause some sources to be forgotten or incorrectly cited. \nWhen using a source, make sure the content is in the same context as the paper. Try to avoid using biased sources. Always take the time to find the correct information about a source. For example, some web pages may be part of a larger website. While a web page article may seem fair and balanced, it can be affected by the overall bias or reputation of the publisher. Using something out of context can also lead to charges of plagiarism. Taking the time to properly cite all sources in a paper or work is paying respect to the original ideas of others. This is all part of doing good work."}

He was the only son of Canute the Great and Emma of Normandy.\nHe followed his father as King of Denmark in 1035, becoming Canute III. Fighting with Magnus I of Norway stopped him from sailing to England to take up his throne. His older, illegitimate half-brother, Harold Harefoot, became regent of England.\nHarold took the English crown for himself in 1037. After Harthacanute had settled the situation in Scandinavia he prepared an invasion of England to take over his kingdom. Harold died, and Harthacanute was able to take back his throne peacefully.\nHarthacanute was a harsh and unpopular ruler. To pay for his ships, he greatly increased the rate of taxation. In 1041, the people of Worcester killed two of Harthacanute's men who had been collecting the tax. Harthacanute burned the city. The story of Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets of Coventry to persuade the local earl to lower taxes, may come from the reign of Harthacanute. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" says of him: \"He never accomplished anything kingly for as long as he ruled\".\nIn 1041, Harthacanute asked his half-brother Edward the Confessor (his mother Emma's son by Ethelred the Unready) back from exile in Normandy to become a member of his household, and probably made Edward his heir.

Although a main cause of the English Civil War was oppression under Charles I, England during the Interregnum became oppressive in its own fashion. Cromwell granted religious freedom otherwise previously unknown in England, but other forms of expression were suddenly limited (for instance, theatre, which had thrived under the Stuart kings and Elizabeth I, was banned).

This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event. \nPope's \"interregnum\" (or \"sede vacante\").\nAn \"interregnum\" occurs also upon the death of the Roman Catholic Pope, though this is generally known as a \"sede vacante\" (vacant seat). The interregnum ends immediately upon election of the new Pope by the College of Cardinals. "}

He supported Parliament against the King, yet he ordered his soldiers to break up parliament. Under his rule, the Protectorate said that people's religious beliefs should be respected, but people who went against what most people believed were sometimes tortured and imprisoned.\nCromwell was the first ruler of England to be a Puritan. He created a new model army. Many English people today think he was one of their greatest leaders.\nEarly life.\nCromwell started off as a gentleman from Huntingdon. He first studied at Huntingdon Grammar School. He had a bad relationship with his father. He went on to Sidney Sussex College at the University of Cambridge. This was a new, small college where he had the chance to talk about his new Puritan ideas. However, he never took a degree because his father died in 1617 while he was studying.\nThe English Civil War.\nIn 1628, Cromwell became an MP and a Puritan and supported Parliament in its quarrel with the King. When war broke out, the King's army was stronger and better-prepared than the army of Parliament. Cromwell saw this, and he decided to train men to fight better. Soon the \"New Model Army\" he had trained began to win battles. As a result, Parliament won the war. By the end of the war, Cromwell was very powerful.\nThe Commonwealth: 16491653.\nDuring the following years, Oliver Cromwell conducted two campaigns to subdue the Irish Catholics (1649-1650), and in the battles of Dunbar and Worcester (1650-1651) crushed the Scottish royalists, who had proclaimed King Charles II. , first-born of the executed sovereign.\nThe Rump Parliament.\nAfter the execution of the King, a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England. A Council of State was appointed to manage affairs, which included Cromwell among its members. His real power base was in the army.\nTakeover of Ireland.\nIn 1652, Cromwell took over Ireland. Many historians believe that Cromwell committed an ethnic cleansing against the Irish Catholic people. Cromwell wanted the Irish Catholics to move out of eastern Ireland into the northwest. According to these historians, Cromwell and his army used massacres, starvation, and threats of execution to force the Irish to leave. Historian Frances Stewart says that 600,000 Irish people 43% of the Irish population died from these policies.\nThe Protectorate: 16531658.\nThe House of Commons tried hard to control the army, but could not: in 1653, Cromwell dissolved the House of Commons, yielded legislative power to 139 people of his confidence and took the title of Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland, with powers wider than those enjoyed by the monarch. During his tenure he reorganized public finances, promoted the liberalization of commerce in order to ensure the prosperity of the mercantile bourgeoisie, promulgated the Navigation Act (1651), through which he imposed on the Netherlands the English maritime supremacy, defeated the United Provinces (1654), snatched Jamaica from Spain (1655), persecuted the Catholics and placed England at the head of the European Protestant countries.\nA new constitution known as the Instrument of Government made Cromwell Lord Protector for life. He had the power to call and dissolve parliaments.\nIn 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament. Cromwell thought about the offer for six weeks. Then he rejected it and was ceremonially re-installed as \"Lord Protector\" (with greater powers than had previously been granted him under this title) at Westminster Hall.\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria (probably first contracted while on campaign in Ireland). He died at Whitehall on 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester.\nAfter Cromwell's death.\nAt his death (3 September 1658), however, the Republic was immersed in a period of chaos, which ended with the restoration of the monarchy in the person of Charles II of England by the Parliament (1660). Despite his prudence, the new monarch did not hesitate to order the exhumation of the corpse of the man who had signed the death sentence of his father, to cut off his head and expose it in the Tower of London.\nHe was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard. Although Richard was not entirely without ability, he had no power base in either Parliament or the Army, and was forced to resign in the spring of 1659, bringing the Protectorate to an end. A year later Parliament restored Charles II as king.\nWhen the Royalists returned to power, Cromwell's corpse was dug up, hung in chains, and beheaded. It is said that his head was lost for months until a soldier found it. His skull was passed around as a token until it was buried at Tyburn."}

It was written and developed by Brad Bird, who once directed \"The Simpsons\" and was best known for directing the animated movie \"The Iron Giant\". The movie was produced by Pixar Animation Studios, and has won an Academy Award. \"The Incredibles\" was originally developed as a traditionally-animated movie, but after Warner Bros. shut down its animation division, Brad Bird moved to Pixar and took the story with him.\nThe movie depicts a world where there are superheroes, but after an intense court hearing, the government decides that all 'supers' must now go undercover and live normal lives. The main character is Robert Parr (Mr Incredible). The sequel \"Incredibles 2\" was released to the public on June 15, 2018.\nPlot.\nIn the 1950s, superheroes are now scorned by the public because of the collateral damage caused by their crime-fighting. After several lawsuits, the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, in which superheroes must give up crime-fighting and live under secret identities. Many years later, in the mid-1960s, Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter)-formerly Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl-live in the suburbs of Metroville with their children Dash (Spencer Fox), Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile). Although Bob loves his family, he secretly resents his white-collar job and his mundane suburban life. Along with his friend Lucius Best (Samuel L. Jackson)-formerly known as Frozen-Bob occasionally moonlights as a vigilante to relive his \"glory days\".\nOne day, Bob and Lucius are nearly caught during one of their vigilante activities when he discovers one of his friends, Gazerbeam, is missing. The next day, after his boss, Gilbert Huph (Wallace Shawn), prevents him from stopping a mugging, Bob loses his temper, and injures Huph with his super strength, leading to him being fired. When he returns home, he receives a video call from a mysterious woman called Mirage (Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a), who assigns him a paid mission to defeat the Omnidroid, a savage robot on a remote island called Nomanisan. Bob travels to the island, where he battles the robot and destroys it by ripping out its power source. Bob finds the action and higher pay rejuvenating; over the next two months, while waiting for another assignment by Mirage, he improves his relationship with his family. When he finds a rip in his super suit, he visits the eccentric costume designer Edna Mode (Brad Bird) to mend it. Assuming Helen knows what Bob is doing, she designs suits for the rest of the family.\nTravelling to Nomanisan again, Bob discovers Mirage is working for the wicked Syndrome (Jason Lee), a jilted fan formerly known as Buddy Pine, who now makes money as an inventor and arms dealer. After escaping from Syndrome, Bob discovers Gazerbeam's skeleton in a cave, with the reflection pointing towards writing on a wall; KRONOS. Bob uses the word to hack into Syndrome's computer, and discovers to his horror, that Syndrome has been perfecting the Omnidroid to kill superheroes after he hires them to fight it. Syndrome's plans to send the Omnidroid to Metroville, where he will manipulate its controls and defeat it, becoming a hero in the eyes of the public; his endgame is to sell his inventions around the world, so everyone can become super, rendering actual superheroes obsolete. \nHelen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon built into the suits to find Bob, accidentally causing him to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome's base. Elastigirl borrows a private plane to travel to the island, and discovers that Dash and Violet have stowed away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Syndrome picks up on Helen's radio transmissions, and he sends anti-aircraft missiles to shoot her down, destroying the plane. Helen and the kids survive and use their powers to reach the island. Helen infiltrates the base and discovers Syndrome's plan. Discontented with Syndrome's indifference when her life was threatened, Mirage frees Bob and tells him his family are alive. Helen arrives and she and Bob race to find their children; Dash and Violet defeat Syndrome's henchmen and reunite with their parents; Syndrome captures them all, and travels to Metroville with the Omnidroid.\nWith the help of Mirage, the family escape. Due to the Omnidroid's advanced intelligence, it recognizes Syndrome as a threat to itself, shooting off the controller from his wrist, rendering him unable to control it, and knocking him out. The Incredibles team up with Frozone, and defeat the Omnidroid. Helen acquires the controls, and Bob destroys the robot's power source. Upon arriving home, the Incredibles discover Syndrome, who plans to capture Jack-Jack and raise him as his apprentice out of revenge. As he travels to his jet, Jack Jack's power manifest and he escapes him in mid-air, being caught by Helen. Bob throws his car at Syndrome's plane, and the villain is incinerated when his cape is caught in the plane's turbines.\nThree months later, the Incredibles are confronted by the supervillain Underminer; they wear their masks, ready to confront the new threat together."}

It was started in Scotland by John Knox during the 16th century. It became powerful in England during the Civil War. Today there are Presbyterian churches across the world.\nPresbyterians (followers of Presbyterianism) believe that the Bible is the most important thing in their church because it was given to humans by God and has no errors in it. They believe that God has control over everything and has chosen to make some people follow Jesus Christ but not others, and that only followers of Jesus may get into heaven. (See Calvinism)\nPresbyterian churches may be led by men called Ministers, Rectors or Elders. Some Presbyterian churches have women as elders. \"Presbyter\" means \"elder\" and they rule in committees. \nThere is no overall leader and there are no bishops in the Presbyterian tradition. On Sunday, the Bible, which they consider the 'Word of God', is read and a sermon preached by the minister is at the heart of a morning worship service, which also includes group singings of some worship songs.\nAround the world.\nThere are Presbyterian churches on every continent except Antarctica, but they do not always agree with each other. There have been many splits (\"schisms\") caused by various disagreements: some about what they believe, some about how they should be organised. In some cases these splits have been healed but many have not.\nIn Scotland, where Presbyterianism started, there are at least seven different groups (\"denominations\"); there are three main groups in England, one in Wales and five in Northern Ireland.\nThere are dozens of different groups in North America, almost all in the USA. They arrived during the 17th century, mostly from Scotland and already disagreeing with each other. Most countries in South America have had Presbyterian churches since the 19th century.\nAt least 23 countries in Africa have Presbyterian churches, also since the 19th century.\nIn Asia, the Korea Presbyterian Church was started through the mission of the Presbyterian Church (USA). After Korean independence, the division was formed afresh as 'Presbyterian Church in Korea (KoRyuPa)' advocating the views of Dutch Reformed churches. In 2012 a new General Assembly of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church of Korea declared authentic historical succession of John Knox."}

At the time, however, not only did doctors regard the \"vulvular stimulation\" required as having nothing to do with sex, they reportedly found that it took a lot of time to do and it was hard work. The vibrator did it more quickly and easily, and because of this it was very popular with doctors. Home versions soon started being made and they were also popular, with adverts in places like \"Needlecraft\", \"Woman's Home Companion\", \"Modern Priscilla\" and the Sears catalog. These disappeared in the 1920s, apparently because their appearance in pornography made it no longer tenable for polite society to avoid the sexual connotations of the devices.\nAs \"body massagers\", millions of vibrators have been sold to both men and women. Some people that buy vibrators only use them for pains. However, many people who purchase vibrators marketed as \"body massagers\" \u2014 and, presumably, most people who purchase vibrators marketed as adult toys \u2014 use them to get sexual pleasure, most often in masturbation. Vibrators often allow people to achieve orgasm faster and easier and are often said to provide stronger orgasms. They are often recommended by sex therapists for women who have difficulty reaching orgasm by other means. Couples also use them sometimes.\nHarper's magazine notes a Durex survey that says 46% of women have vibrators near 2006. This may have been market research relating to their vibrating condom base product.\nThe sale of vibrators and similar items was forbidden up until recently in several states in the southern United States. In Texas, the sale of vibrators and dildos is technically illegal, but many stores will sell such items provided that the customer sign a statement that the device will be used only for educational purposes. The law\u2019s current status in real life is not certain. The states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Indiana, Virginia, Louisiana and Massachusetts have all had laws that prohibit vibrators, but most of them have been struck down by courts or aren\u2019t actually enforced. Only the law in Alabama is generally enforced.\nTypes of erotic vibrators.\nAn enormous range of vibrators exist, falling into several broad categories:\nMost vibrators use internal batteries, but some of them have a power cord and must be plugged into a power socket to work."}

He wrote in \"De Bello Gallico\" that there were many tribes there, very similar to other Celtic tribes in Europe. Coins, and later Roman historians, have given us the names of some of the rulers of the tribes, and what they did.\nIn 43 AD, Claudius successfully invaded England with 40,000 soldiers landing at Gaul at Richborough, Kent.\nFor hundreds of years, what is now England was a Roman province, Britannia. The Romans later gave up on the province and left the Celtic people on their own as the Roman Empire began to fall apart. The influence of the Romans meant that the territory of England had already experienced unity before the Anglo-Saxons arrived.\nAnglo-Saxon England.\nAnalysis of human bodies found at an ancient cemetery near Abingdon, England, shows that Saxon immigrants and native Britons lived side-by-side.\nThe Romano-British population (the Britons) was assimilated. The settlement (or invasion) of England is called the Saxon Conquest, or the Anglo-Saxon or English Conquest.\nFrom the 4th century AD, many Britons left to cross the English Channel from Wales, Cornwall and southern Britain, and started to settle the western part of Gaul (Armorica), where they started a new nation: Brittany. The Britons gave their new country its name and the Breton language, Brezhoneg, a sister language to Welsh and Cornish. The name \"Brittany\" (from \"Little Britain\") arose at this time to tell the new Britain apart from \"Great Britain\". Brezhoneg is still spoken in Brittany today.\nThe Vikings.\nAfter a time of raids, the Vikings also began to settle in England and to trade, eventually controlling an area called the Danelaw from the late 9th century. One Viking settlement was at York, called Jorvik by the Vikings. Viking rule left traces in the English language \u2014 because Old English was already related to Old Norse, many Norse words began to be used in English at this time.\nEngland during the Middle Ages.\nThe defeat of King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 against Duke William II of Normandy, later called William I of England, and the following Norman conquest of England caused important changes in the history of Britain. William ordered the Domesday Book to be written. This was a survey of the entire population, and their lands and property, to help in collecting taxes.\nWilliam also ruled Normandy, then a powerful duchy in France. William and his nobles spoke, and held court, in Anglo-Norman, in Normandy as well as in England. The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy was kept up for centuries, and had a great influence on the development of Old English into Middle English.\nIn England, the Middle Ages was a time of war, civil war, rebellions from time to time, and many plots among the nobles and royalty. England had more than enough cereals, dairy products, beef and mutton. The nation's international economy was based on the wool trade, where wool from northern England was sold to the textile merchants of Flanders to make into cloth. Medieval foreign policy was also shaped by relations with the Flemish cloth business. An English cloth business was developed in the fifteenth century, allowing the English also to become wealthier.\nIn the reign of Henry II, the king got some power back from the barony and the Church. Henry's successor, Richard I \"the Lion Heart\", took part in the Third Crusade, and defended his French territories against Philip II of France. His younger brother John, who followed him as king, was not so lucky; he lost Normandy and many other French territories. In 1215, the barons led an armed rebellion and forced him to sign the Magna Carta, which put legal limits on the King's personal powers.\nThe reign of Edward I (1272\u20131307) was rather successful. Edward strengthened the powers of his Government, and called the first English Parliament. He conquered Wales. His son, Edward II, lost the Battle of Bannockburn against Scotland.\nThe Black Death, an epidemic that spread over all of Europe and parts of Asia, arrived in England in 1349 and killed perhaps up to a third of the population.\nEdward III gave land to powerful noble families, including many people with royal blood. Because land was like power in these days, some powerful men could now try to claim the Crown.\nTudor England.\nThe Wars of the Roses ended with the victory of Henry Tudor, who became king Henry VII of England, at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, where the Yorkist king, Richard III was killed.\nHis son, Henry VIII split with the Roman Catholic Church over a question of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Though his religious position was not entirely Protestant, this led to the Church of England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church. There followed a time of great religious and political troubles, and the English Reformation.\nHenry VIII had three children, all of whom would wear the Crown. The first to reign was Edward VI of England. Although he was intelligent, he was only a boy of ten when he took the throne in 1547.\nWhen Edward VI died of tuberculosis in 1553 Mary I took the throne when crowds cheered for her in London, which people at the time said was the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary, a loyal Catholic who had been influenced greatly by the Catholic King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, tried to get the country back to Catholicism. This led to 274 burnings of Protestants, and much hatred from her people. Mary lost Calais, the last English possession on the Continent, and became even more unpopular (except among Catholics) at the end of her reign.\nThe reign of Elizabeth returned a sort of order to England in 1558. The religious question that had divided the country since Henry VIII was put to rest by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, which set up the Church of England in much the same form it has today.\nThe slave trade that made Britain a major economic power began with Elizabeth, who gave John Hawkins permission to start trading in 1562.\nThe government of Elizabeth was more peaceful, apart from the revolt of the northern earls in 1569, and she was able to lessen the power of the old nobility and expand the power of her government. One of the most famous events in English military history was in 1588 when the Spanish Armada lost against the English navy, commanded by Sir Francis Drake. Elizabeth's government did much to make her government stronger, and to make common law and administration more effective throughout England.\nIn all, the Tudor period is seen as an important one, leading to many questions that would have to be answered in the next century during the English Civil War. These were questions of how much power the monarch and Parliament should have, and how much one should control the other.\nThe Stuarts and the Civil War.\nElizabeth died without children who could take the throne after her. Her closest male Protestant relative was the king of Scotland, James VI, of the house of Stuart, so he became James I of England, the first king of the entire island of Great Britain, although he ruled England and Scotland as separate countries.\nThe English Civil War began in 1642, mainly because of conflicts between James' son, Charles I, and Parliament. The defeat of the Royalist army by the New Model Army of Parliament at the Battle of Naseby in June 1645 destroyed most of the King's forces. The capture and trial of Charles led to his beheading in January 1649 at Whitehall Gate in London. A republic was declared, and Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector in 1653. After he died, his son Richard Cromwell followed him in the office, but soon quit. The monarchy was returned in 1660, after England had a time of anarchy, with King Charles II again in London.\nIn 1665, London was hit with the plague, and then, in 1666, the capital was burned for 5 days by the Great Fire, destroying around 15,000 buildings.\nIn 1689, the Dutch Protestant William of Orange, replaced the Catholic King James II in what is called the Glorious Revolution. However, in Scotland and Ireland, Catholics loyal to James II were not so happy, and a series of bloody revolts followed. These rebellions continued until the mid-18th century, when Charles Edward Stuart was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.\nThe First Act of Union made Scotland, England and Wales into one country. The history of England after this 1707 Act is a part of Great Britain's history."}

{"id": "47511", "revid": "7798816", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47511", "title": "Anglo-Saxons", "text": "The Anglo-Saxons were the dominant people living in England from the mid-5th century AD until the Norman conquest in 1066. They spoke Germanic languages and are identified by Bede as the descendants of three powerful tribes. These were the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Their language, \"Anglo-Saxon\" or Old English, came from West Germanic dialects. It changed into Middle English from about the 11th century. Old English was divided into four main dialects: West Saxon, Mercian, Northumbrian and Kentish. \nThe Anglo-Saxon culture replaced the Celtic culture in the area that is now England. Modern historians do not think that the Anglo-Saxons drove the Celts away, but instead that they became an upper class to the Celts in England, and the Celts then became part of the Anglo-Saxon culture. They never conquered Wales but Anglo-Saxon kings did claim overlordship from time to time. Some Anglo-Saxons came to Britain as warriors, but others came peacefully to become farmers or to raise families.\nAnglo-Saxon migration.\nIt is not known how many Anglo-Saxons actually came to Britain between the 4th and 6th century AD. Many sources say large numbers of Anglo-Saxon settlers arrived. Because of this, some of the native Britons moved west, towards Wales and Cornwall. Others went to Armorica and became the Bretons. The language of the Anglo-Saxons, Old English, became the main language in southern Britain. A few Celtic and Latin words were borrowed into Old English.\nIn the areas such as Kent, Sussex, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, many of the native Britons may have been driven out. In other areas, some Britons likely remained and were absorbed into Anglo-Saxon society. In 2011, a historian suggested that about 1 or 2 Anglo-Saxons came to England for every 10 Celts that were already there.\nAngles, Saxons and Jutes.\nIt was Bede who identified the invaders as Angles, Saxons and Jutes. But he sometimes used the names \"Angli\" and \"Saxones\" for the same people in different parts of his writings. In Book I, Chapter 15 he said that by invitation of King Vortigern \"Angles \"or\" Saxons\" came to Britain in three longships. Modern authorities confirm that Angles, Saxons, Frisians and some Jutes did come to England during this migration time period. The differences between the tribes that moved to England were not significant. Kent was different in culture from other parts of England, mostly because it had close contact with parts of Europe such as Gaul. \nCertain styles of jewellery are recognized by archaeologists as being typical of Anglian, Saxon and Jutish areas in Northern Europe. But why the name England came to be used for the country and English for the language is not clear. In Old English the people called themselves \"Engle,\" and in Latin they were called \"Angli,\" but nothing suggests the Angles made up the largest percentage of the Germanic peoples in Britain. The name \"Englaland\", which became 'England' was regularly used by the 11th century.\nCeltic words for the Anglo-Saxons.\nThe native British people, who wrote in both Latin and Welsh (a Celtic language), referred to these invaders as \"Saxones\" or \"Saeson\". The latter name is still used today in the Welsh word for English people, \"Saeson\", the English language, \"Saesneg\", and things related to England, \"Seisnig\". In the Scottish Gaelic language the word for an English person is \"sasannach\" and in Irish the word is s\"asanach\".\nArt.\nAnglo-Saxon art before the time of Alfred (who ruled from 871\u2013899) is a mixture of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and styles. The Sutton Hoo treasure is an excellent example of very early Anglo-Saxon metalwork and jewellery. It came from a royal grave of the early 7th century. The period between Alfred and the Norman Conquest saw a distinct Anglo-Saxon style in art. This was due in part to the revival of the English economy and culture after the end of the Viking raids. This later style appears to have been in touch with trends in western Europe.\nAnglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through illuminated manuscripts. Manuscripts were not the only Anglo-Saxon art form, but they have survived in much greater numbers than other types of objects. People in Europe at the time regarded Anglo-Saxon goldsmithing and embroidery as especially fine. The most common examples of Anglo-Saxon art are coins. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in fresco, ivory, stone carving, metalwork and enamel, but few of these pieces have survived.\nLiterature.\nOld English literary works include epic poetry, biography, sermons, Bible translations, legal works, chronicles, riddles and others. In all there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period.\nA very famous work from this period is the poem \"Beowulf\". It has achieved national epic status in Britain. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" is a collection of important early English history. \"C\u00e6dmon's Hymn\" from the 7th century is the earliest attested literary text in (Old) English. One of the most valuable and important sources on Anglo-Saxon history is Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation\"."}

He invaded England after the death of King Edward the Confessor because he believed he had the most right to be King of England, but King Harold II had himself crowned king instead. King Harold, with his Saxon army, and Duke William fought at the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066. King Harold was killed in the battle and his army left. On December 25, 1066 William was crowned the new King of England.\nThe Norman conquest was an important change in English history. The conquest linked England more closely with Continental Europe, and made Scandinavian influence less important. It created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe. The conquest changed the English language and culture, and set the stage for rivalry with France, which would continue (with a few breaks) until the 19th century. \nEngland has never been successfully invaded since the Norman invasion nearly 1000 years ago."}

Many Christian churches in Europe broke away from Rome. Each of the countries that went through this process did so in a different way. Earlier the Roman Catholic Church had supreme powers. \nHenry VIII broke ties with the church and became head of the English church. This was done in 1534 in the Acts of Supremacy. It was the beginning of the Church of England. His friend Thomas Cranmer became Henry's Archbishop of Canterbury. For years, the Church of England was almost exactly the same as the Catholic Church, except that it was ruled by the King instead of the Pope. This is different from the Reformation on the European continent, where the reformers wanted big changes right away. \nThere were several causes for the English Reformation. One of these was that Henry VIII, who was King of England, wanted to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Another reason was because Henry wanted the Church's wealth and power, and got them with the dissolution of the monasteries. \nThe Protestant Reformation in Scotland, however, was based more on the teachings of Martin Luther and John Calvin, so it was more like the Reformation in continental Europe.

There are different ways to calculate it. It serves as a check, that no errors have been made when writing down the number. In its simplest form, the digits are simply added up. This can however not detect errors of swapping digits around. Better ways (algorithms) of calculating a checksum are to use a Hamming code, a cyclic redundancy check or modular arithmetic. One of the uses of checksums is to check that account numbers have been entered correctly. \nPortuguese bank account identifiers are a good example of how checksums work. They have 21 digits. The first 19 digits identify the bank, branch and account number. The last two digits are \"mod 97\" checksum digits based on modular arithmetic. A typical Portuguese bank account number is 0002.0123.12345678901.54. The digits have the following meanings:\nIf 000201231234567890154 (the bank account number without the dots) is divided by 97, the answer is 207458809978249 remainder 1. Since the remainder is \"1\", the bank account identifier is probably correct. If the person writing down the number missed a digit, swapped two digits around or wrote a digit down incorrectly the remainder would not have been \"1\". If this is the case then the computer should detect an error and give an error message. \nAnother place where checksums are used are serial numbers for computer software. "}

There he must save Princess Toadstool (later Princess Peach) from Bowser. Players also can use Luigi during two-player mode. The game was made by Shigeru Miyamoto. The music was made by K\u014dji Kond\u014d.\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" was a very important game because it changed how games were made later. It was the best-selling video game ever before being beat by \"Wii Sports\" in 2009. It turned Mario into a famous symbol. It also made the NES successful. This game greatly helped the video game industry.\nIt is a graphics style in Super Mario Maker, Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS, and Super Mario Maker 2.\nPlot.\nBowser has kidnapped Princess Toadstool, who is the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario must chase Bowser through eight worlds in the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue her, with the help of his brother, Luigi.\nGameplay.\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" is a platform game. In the game, Mario must race through the Mushroom Kingdom and save Princess Toadstool (later Princess Peach) from Bowser. Mario jumps, runs, and walks across each level. The worlds are full of enemies and platforms, and open holes. If Mario touches an enemy, he dies. If he falls down a hole or misses a jump, he will also lose a life.\nMario has several \"power ups\". A red and white Mushroom will make him big. If Mario is big and if he touches an enemy he gets smaller; he will not die. If Mario is big and he hits a question block that has a power-up, a fire flower will come out. The fire flower will give him the power to throw fire balls, which can defeat enemies. If he gets hit as Fire Mario, he will go back to being small Mario.\nEach world is divided into four levels. Some levels are underground and others are underwater. When Mario is underwater, he cannot jump on any enemy and he will shrink or die if he touches one.\nThe fourth level is a castle. Mario faces lava, fire bars, and other enemies in this level. At the end of the level is Bowser, who stands over a lava pit. Mario can throw fireballs to defeat Bowser. He can also jump over or run under Bowser to an axe. Touching the axe will destroy the bridge and cause Bowser to fall into the lava, defeating him. Toadstool's servant, Toad, will then tell Mario that the princess is in another castle. The eighth boss is the real Bowser and instead of Toad, the princess is there.\nImpact.\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" was both the launch game and a good game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This game and \"Duck Hunt\" was bundled with every NES sold and the game sold 40 million units as a result. There is also a version of the game with Duck Hunt and World Class Track Meet, which is for the NES Power Glove.\nThe game's main theme, which plays in the first level of the game, is very well known. It was composed by Koji Kondo. After it was in \"Super Mario Bros.\", it has been in many other Nintendo games."}

It was founded in 1995 in Little Rock, Arkansas by singer Amy Lee and former-guitarist Ben Moody. The band gained local popularity and released a number of EPs before signing a record deal with Wind-Up.\nThe band released \"Fallen\", their first full-length album, in 2003. \"Fallen\" gained popularity after two of its songs were featured in the film \"Daredevil\". The album was a critical and commercial success and sold more than 17 million copies worldwide; spawning the hit singles \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d and \u201cMy Immortal\u201d. It also helped the band win two Grammy awards.\nIn 2006, the band released their second studio album, \"The Open Door\", which was positively received. It debuted at #1 in the Billboard Hot 200 chart, and sold more than 447.000 copies in its first week. The album sold more than 6 million copies and its third single, \u201cSweet Sacrifice\u201d, was honored with a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Song.\nAfter concluding \u201cThe Open Door Tour\", the band went on a lengthy hiatus. The band announced that they would be working on a new album in June 2009, but the production was delayed several times. \"Evanescence\", the bands\u2019 self-titled third studio album, was eventually released on October 11, 2011.

David Hodges was the first member to exit the band in 2002. Co-founder Moody left the band mid-tour in 2004 due to creative differences with frontwoman Lee, followed by Will Boyd in 2006. In 2007, Lee fired guitarist John LeCompt and drummer Rocky Gray announced he was quitting the band shortly after. As of mid-2007, Lee is the only original member left in the band.\nEvanescence was ranked at #71 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. As a female-fronted band that utilizes dramatic vocals and orchestral elements in their music, critics and fans have drawn parallels between Evanescence and other female-fronted symphonic and gothic metal bands such as Lacuna Coil. The band is recognized for their dark music and lyrics, Lee\u2019s vocals and piano instrumentations against the background of \u201cchugging\u201d guitar riffs and their use of electronic elements.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1994 \u2013 2002).\nThe people who founded Evanescence are singer, songwriter and pianist Amy Lee and guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody who is no longer a member in the band. They met in a youth camp in 1994, when Moody heard Lee playing a song on the piano.\nAfter that, they started writing music together. Two of their songs were played on the local radio station and the listeners wanted them to do a concert. They later appeared live and became a popular act in their area.\nThey chose \"Evanescence\" as a name for their band because Lee thought \"it is mysterious and dark, and places a picture in the listener' mind.\" Evanescence means \"to disappear\" or \"to fade away\".\nBefore \"Fallen\" was released, Evanescence made two EPs (\"Evanescence EP\" and \"Sound Asleep EP\") and one Demo CD called \"Origin\". Some of the songs on \"Fallen\" can be found on their previous records, like My Immortal.\nFallen and Anywhere but Home (2003 \u2013 2005).\nThree of Lee and Moody's friends joined the band. They were John LeCompt, Rocky Gray and Will Boyd. The three also worked on previous Evanescence songs. The band also signed their first major label in early 2003 and started working on \"Fallen\".\n\"Fallen\" became a worldwide success, and spent 43 weeks on the Billboard top 10 charts. It sold over 15 million copies and was certified 7x platinum in the United States. It is also one of the eight albums to stay for at least a year within the Billboard Top 50 charts.\nTheir most successful single from \"Fallen\" is Bring Me to Life, which won a Grammy award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2004. Another popular single is \"My Immortal\", which was nominated for a Grammy in 2005. The other two singles are Going Under and Everybody\u2019s Fool. All four songs had videos to promote them.\nBen Moody left the band while they were touring in Europe. The reason given for this is because of creative differences with the band\u2019s singer Amy Lee. Moody was replaced by another guitarist, Terry Balsamo.\nIn 2004, Evanescence released Anywhere but Home, their first live album. It includes a concert in Paris, some behind-the-scenes features, and the single \"Missing\", which reached #1 in Spain. The CD also had three live songs, \"Breathe No More\", \"Farther Away\", and the band's cover of Korn's Thoughtless.\nThe Open Door and Hiatus (2006 \u2013 2010).\nWill Boyd left the band in 2006 for \"not wanting to do another big tour\" and for wanting \"to be close to his family\". He was replaced by Tim McCord.\n\"The Open Door\" is the band's first album to reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The album had four singles with videos, which are Call Me When You're Sober, Lithium, \"Sweet Sacrifice\" and Good Enough. In 2007, Evanescence was nominated for a Grammy award for \"Sweet Sacrifice\".\nThe band toured two times to promote \"The Open Door\". The first tour was held in countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia. In the second tour, they returned to the US and had more concerts there. They also joined the Family Values Tour 2007 with the band Korn and the Argentinean festival Quilems Rock 07 with the bands Aerosmith and Velvet Revolver.\nOn May 4, 2007, John LeCompt said that he was fired from Evanescence, and that Rocky Gray left the band. They were replaced for some time by Will Hunt and Troy McLawhorn, who are from the band Dark New Day.\nEvanescence (2011 \u2013 present).\nLee announced in June 2009 that Evanescence were working on a new album and explained the reason behind the lengthy absence:\n\"I believe that to make great music you have to give yourself the freedom to evolve. I don\u2019t see the point in making the same record twice, so I always want to challenge myself to make something better, stronger, and more interesting than before. That takes time, but it\u2019s worth the wait for me. Hopefully, it will be for the fans too. Look out for new music next year\u2026\"\nLee later posted more information about the album through Evanescence's fan forum, EvThreads. She described the music as \"dark, sarcastic, fun, strange, familiar and very different at the same time\", stating that it's not music people would expect from the band. In another post, she mentioned that she was collaborating with Will \"Science\" Hunt and Balsamo in writing for the album.\nThe band played a sold-out \"secret show\" at the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom in New York City on November 4, 2009, along with label-mates Civil Twilight. The tickets sold out in five minutes. Lee told the audience that the bands' appearance was a warm-up for their headlining appearance at the Maquin\u00e1ria festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, which took place on November 8. The Maquin\u00e1ria show featured an intro containing a brief sample of the bands' new music. Lee later posted the lyrics to the intro on EvThreads and stated that she was \"glad\" to share \"at least just a minute of new music\". Both these appearances featured James Black of Finger Eleven as a fill-in guitarist.\nEvanescence entered the studio on February 22, 2010 to begin recording and chose Steve Lillywhite to produce the album. Will Hunt joined Evanescence as a drummer while Will \"Science\" Hunt participated as a programmer and secondary drummer. Despite his collaboration with Lee on most songs of the album, he eventually didn't join the band. The album was initially more electronic music-oriented and slated for a late 2010 release. However, according to Lee, Lillywhite \"wasn't the right fit\" and the music \"wasn't coming together right\". He was eventually replaced by producer Nick Rasculinecz and the band started over with writing new material and developing songs from the previous session.\nIn June 21, Lee announced in Evthreads.com that the band have temporarily left the studio to work further on the songs and that their label company was going through \"uncertain times\", which could delay the release of the album. However, she stated in her post that the band would return to the studio \"soon enough\". Evanescence reentered the studio in early April, 2011 with producer Nick Rasculinecz, and the album was speculated to be released in fall 2011. Because of the change og producers, Lee indicated that the album would be heavier in its sound. She also noted the band's growing participation in the songwriting process, saying that she felt like she was \"finally in a real band\". Additionally, Troy McLawhorn rejoined Evanescence as a primary guitarist for the album, though not as a permanent band member. On June 12, Lee announced through her Twitter account that McLawhorn was officially back with Evanescence and that the new release date for the album was October 4, 2011."}

Its roots go back to the early medieval period. It took over more and more from the power of the monarch. Its existence ended in 1707. \nAfter the Act of Union 1707 became the main part of the Parliament of Great Britain, and later the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The other nations of the United Kingdom (Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) each has a legislature of its own. This is called devolution. England does not have such a legislature today.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origin of Parliament can be found in the times of the Anglo-Saxons. Anglo-Saxon kings were advised by a council known as the \"Witenagemot\", to which belonged the King's sons and brothers. \nThe Ealdormen, or executive heads of the shire and the senior clergymen of the state, had seats as well. The King still had the highest authority, but laws were made only after seeking the advice (and, in later times, the consent) of the \"Witenagemot\".\nDevelopment.\nThe royal council slowly grew into a Parliament. The first time the word \"Parliament\" can be found in official documents was during Henry III's reign. It was still mostly informal, and not an official body. The right to vote in Parliamentary elections for county constituencies was the same everywhere in the country, giving a vote to everyone who owned the freehold of land to a rent of 40 shillings a year (Forty-shilling Freeholders). \nThe rise of Parliament's power was slowed down by civil war between Stephen and Empress Matilda. By the end of the Wars of the Roses, the king had the strongest authority again. The Crown was at the height of its power during the reign of Henry VIII. \nThe great struggle between the Crown and Parliament happened under James I's successor, Charles I. The House of Commons sent Charles the Petition of Right, demanding to have their rights again, in 1628. Though he accepted the petition, he later closed Parliament and ruled without them for eleven years. It was only after he had money problems as a result of war, that he was forced to call Parliament so they could authorise new taxes. The new Parliament was quite rebellious, so the king shut them down after only three weeks; this was called the Short Parliament. But this did not help the king with his money problem, so he realized that he would need to call another Parliament. Their struggle for power with the king led to the English Civil War. Those supporting the Parliament were called Parliamentarians or 'Roundheads'. In 1649, Charles was put to death by the Rump Parliament and replaced by the military dictator Oliver Cromwell. After Cromwell's death, however, the monarchy was restored in 1660. \nFollowing the Restoration, monarchs agreed to regularly call Parliament. But there was no clear guarantee of Parliamentary liberties until James II, an unpopular Catholic ruler, was forced to flee the country in 1688. Parliament decided that he had given up his crown, and offered it to his Protestant daughter Mary, instead of his Catholic son. Mary II ruled together with her husband, William III.\nUnion: the Parliament of Great Britain.\nFollowing the Treaty of Union in 1707, the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland made acts of parliament which made a new United Kingdom of Great Britain. The existence of both parliaments came to an end. The new legislature was the new Parliament of Great Britain. Its home was the Palace of Westminster, the old home of the old Parliament of England."}

She is the current women's IAAF world record holder for the marathon with a time of 2:17:42 hours. She also ran the IAAF women's world best time of 2:15:25 hours. She is a three-time winner of the London Marathon, two-time New York Marathon champion, and won the 2002 Chicago Marathon.\nRadcliffe is a former world champion for the marathon, half marathon and cross country races. She has also been European champion over 10,000\u00a0metres on the track and over the cross country races. On the track, Radcliffe has also won the 10,000\u00a0metres silver medal at the 1999 World Athletics Championships and was the 2002 Commonwealth Games gold medalist over 5,000\u00a0metres. Radcliffe has won many awards including the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, Laureus World Comeback of the Year, IAAF World Athlete of the Year, AIMS World Athlete of the Year (three times) and a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).\nRadcliffe is an asthmatic sufferer who has voiced her opposition to the use of drugs in sport. She is married to her coach, Gary Lough, and has two children. Radcliffe is the great niece of Charlotte Radcliffe, who won an Olympic silver medal in the 1920 Games.\nAnti doping.\nRadcliffe has often made comments about drugs in sport. Radcliffe backed the IAAF after Olga Yegorova was caught using drugs. Radcliffe and team-mate Hayley Tullett caused trouble in the heats of the 5,000\u00a0metres at the 2001 World Athletics Championships. They held up a sign protesting against Yegorova. Yegorova had been caught using, EPO, but was allowed to race. The sign was made by Radcliffe's husband and said 'EPO Cheats Out'. It was taken off them by the stadium officials. But not before it was seen on television. Team mates Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling also demonstrated in the final. They were seen wearing Radcliffe masks and held up signs, one of which said 'Free Paula'. Radcliffe said after the Championships that she would continue her fight against drugs in sport. Radcliffe wears a red ribbon when racing to show her support for blood testing as a method of catching drugs cheats. Radcliffe first wore the ribbon at the 1999 European Cup. This was encouraged by Blandine Bitzner-Ducret. At the end of 2001 Radcliffe was given the choice not to race against Yegorova in televised meetings in the United Kingdom.\nSuspicious blood levels.\nDuring Radcliffe's highly successful 2002 season, foreign media, were convinced that she was taking drugs. But Radcliffe asked UK Sport to reveal her drugs tests. They showed that she had been tested five times and on each occasion was clean. Radcliffe said she was unhappy with the whispers coming from French newspaper L'Equipe. She asked for the IAAF to conduct random blood and urine samples before the Chicago marathon. She also asked them to freeze the samples so when tougher testers are developed they can prove that she ran clean. One of her blood samples were deemed suspicious by a doping agency. Paula however said she was innocent and not a cheater.\nPersonal life.\nPaula Radcliffe was born to Peter and Pat Radcliffe. She was born on the 17 December 1973 in Cheshire. Radcliffe is the great-niece of 1920 Olympic Silver medalist Charlotte Radcliffe. Radcliffe has a brother. Martin. He is two years younger than her. Radcliffe's family moved to Oakley, Bedfordshire when she was 11. Radcliffe achieved four A levels at grade A in French, German, Maths and General Studies, while at Sharnbrook Upper School in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire. Radcliffe had a choice between Loughborough and Cambridge for University. She chose Loughborough. In 1996 she finished her degree a few months early so she could prepare for the Olympic Games.\nRadcliffe met her husband Gary Lough at Loughborough University. At University Radcliffe studied French, German and economics. She left university with a first-class honours degree in modern European studies. Lough and Radcliffe married in 2000. They have two children. In 2007 they had their first child, Isla. Their second child, Raphael, was born on 29 September 2010. But had to be resuscitated as he had his Umbilical cord wound round his neck. Radcliffe first said of wanting to start a family in.\nIn the 2002 Queen's Birthday Honours, Radcliffe was awarded an MBE. In October she was given her MBE saying; \"It means a great deal to me, it's a great honour and it really tops off an amazing year. To come here and receive this and to meet the Queen at the end of it just finishes it off perfectly.\" Radcliffe became the first Britain in 2006 to win the Abebe Bikila Award. At the end of 2010 Radcliffe was voted England Athletics athlete of the decade."}

It often happens in large numbers. Migration can be within countries or between countries. Humans are known to have migrated extensively throughout history and prehistory.\nSometimes, the movement is voluntary, but sometimes, people are forced to move. They may suffer warfare, religious and political persecution, famine, and other natural disasters.\nWhen people are forced to move, they are refugees. Many refugees are illegal immigrants and more than half are children and women. They may live in extreme poverty, lacking food, shelter, clothing, education and medical care.\nRural-urban migration.\nRural-urban migration, or urbanization, is the movement from country areas to towns and cities. There are many reasons for people leaving the countryside. Often, they are overpopulation, high birth rates, and starvation. Mechanization has caused a reduction in jobs available in the countryside.\nFarming is hard work, with long hours and little pay. Many are subsistence farmers. In developing countries, a lack of money means a lack of machinery. Natural disasters, such as droughts, hurricanes, floods and volcanic eruptions, destroy villages and crops. There is a lack of services like schools and hospitals in the countryside.\nPeople move because they are looking for better-paid jobs and a higher quality of life. They have a better chance of services such as schools, medical treatment and entertainment. People are also attracted often by the advantages of a cosmopolitan lifestyle such as shops, restaurants, theaters, and nightlife.\nMany arrive with little money and so canmot buy or rent a house, even if one is available. They must usually make a temporary shelter with cheap or usef materials. Some give up and go home.\nMany children of migrant worker struggle for education. \nIn the new country, they often are not integrated and are treated like an underclass. However, they are needed even if the local population doe not like immigrants because they compete for the same jobs.\nMore people means more traffic and more crime. Immigrants help to build up cities, provide cheap labour, invest money, buy products and services, pay tax, and help companies compete.\nAncient times.\nThe Proto-Indo-Europeans migrated many times between 4000 and 1000 BC, according to the Kurgan hypothesis.\nModern times.\nThe movement of populations in modern times has continued under the form of both voluntary migration within one's region, country, or beyond, and involuntary migration, which includes slave trade, human trafficking, and ethnic cleansing. The people who migrate are called migrants or, more specifically, emigrants, immigrants or settlers, depending on the historical setting, circumstance, and perspective.\nMany people have died while migrating."}

EU citizens elect its members once every five years. Together with the Council of Ministers, it is the law-making branch of the institutions of the Union. It meets in two locations: Strasbourg and Brussels .\nMembers.\nThe Parliament is made up of its 751 members, called \"MEPs\". Each member speaks for an area of Europe, for example Paris, Denmark or Sicily. Anyone can be elected, they are elected by all the EU citizens, the people who are citizens of a country in the EU. People have been elected to Parliament since 1979, before that they came from the Parliaments of each country. Because MEPs come from lots of countries, they all speak different languages (24 in 2013) at Parliament. This means that the Parliament has to have lots of interpreters because thay are protected right to first language (multilingualism).\nUnlike other international groups of politicians, MEPs do not sit in groups of countries, but they sit next to people who they share ideas with. The two largest groups are the \"European People's Party-European Democrats\" and the \"Party of European Socialists\". But these groups work together to agree, so they do not fight and try to make a law if the other does not like it.\nPower.\nThe European Parliament's power depends on which area of the EU it is working in. The EU has three areas, the \"Community\", its representation to other countries, and things to do with police and courts. In the last two areas, it can not do much as the Council takes care of those issues, but in the Community (which is the largest area) it can change or stop any law. But the Council also has to agree, and sometimes they disagree and cannot make a law.\nWhile Parliament can change a law, it cannot start a new one, it has to ask the European Commission to do that. The European Commission works on everyday work and the Parliament has to make sure it does its job properly, if it does not Parliament can make them all leave their jobs or not allow them to spend the EU budget.\nWork.\nWhen the Parliament wants to make a new law, they all vote at the same time. But before then, they make many small changes while talking with experts who know about the things that the new law will change. As in other parliaments, they do this in small meetings known as \"Committees\" of between 28 and 86 MEPs.\nThe Parliament has a President. The President is elected by the MEPs, two times every two and a half years, to organise the meetings and speak for the Parliament when meeting other leaders. Since 2019, the president has been Italian politician David Sassoli.\nHistory.\nThe Parliament was made in 1952 and was then called the \"Common Assembly\". At this time, it did not have any power, it was only asked to comment on laws made by the \"European Coal and Steel Community\". In 1957, it was renamed the \"European Parliamentary Assembly\" and got to comment on the laws of the \"European Economic Community\" and the \"European Atomic Energy Community\". Over the following years, it was given a few powers over laws and money and it called itself the \"European Parliament\" in the 1960s. It wanted to be elected so it could do more, as if people voted for the people in Parliament, the Council and Commission would have to pay more attention to it (this is known as \"Democratic Legitimacy\", the idea that your voice is worth more if you have lots of people supporting from an election).\nIn 1979 it held its first election, and it gained more powers and also members because more countries joined the Communities and they elected people as well. In 1993 it was given even more, and power over the Commission, when the European Union took the place of the Communities. It is now known as one of the most powerful Parliaments in the world."}

As an example, suppose the law is going to be about farming, then the Agriculture Ministers are the Council for that day.\nAs well as making laws, they can meet to discuss their problems. For example, the European Union does not decide on tax - each country decides on its own tax. But the Finance Ministers meet anyway because sometimes they can help each other catch people who do not want to pay tax at all.\nThe Council is called different things in different countries, according to the language they speak (for example in French it is \"Conseil de l'Union Europ\u00e9enne\" and in German it is \"Rat der Europ\u00e4ischen Union\"). It is also known internationally, and so it appears on its logo, with the Latin word Consilium.\nA simple way of putting it, is that The 'Council of the European Union' is helped by most countries in the world and it is very important."}

A thin needle is inserted into a mass or lump to extract cells that will be examined under a microscope. Fine needle aspiration biopsies are very safe, minor surgical procedures. Often, a major surgical (excisional or open) biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration biopsy instead."}

This frequency, the upper limit of human hearing, is approximately 20,000 hertz (20 kilohertz).\nHearing ultrasound.\nSome animals, such as dogs, dolphins, bats, and mice, are able to hear sounds which have a frequency higher than upper-limit of the human ear. This makes them able to hear ultrasounds. Children can hear some high-pitched sounds that older adults cannot hear, as in humans the upper limit pitch of hearing gets lower as a person gets older. This frequency limit is caused by the middle ear that acts as a low-pass filter. If ultrasound is fed directly into the skull bone and reaches the cochlea without passing through the middle ear, much higher frequencies (up to about 200 kHz) can be heard. This effect (sometimes called ultrasonic hearing) was first discovered by divers exposed to a high-frequency (ca. 50 kHz) sonar signal.\nMedical ultrasonography is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is generally thought of as a \"safe test\" because it does not use destructive ionizing radiation like x-rays.\nUltrasonic cleaning.\nUltrasonic cleaners are sometimes mistakenly called supersonic cleaners. They are used at frequencies from 20-40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments and industrial parts. An ultrasonic cleaner works by the energy released from the collapse of millions of tiny (microscopic) bubbles near the dirty surface. The bubbles are formed by cavitation and collapse, forming small jets directed at the surface."}

We now know that ice ages have happened a number of times in the past, the greatest and longest of which took place in the Proterozoic era, before multi-cellular eukaryotes evolved.\nDuring ice ages the sea level drops as water is held in the great ice sheets at the poles. How much it drops depends on several factors, such as the length of time that a cold period lasts.\nStages.\nWithin an ice age, there are stages. The longer cold stages are called glacials or glacial periods. The shorter warm periods are called interglacials. The last glacial ended about 11,000 years ago when the present interglacial started. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets still exist. The last two million years have been the Pleistocene ice age. During glacials, large and thick ice sheets cover much of the North American and Eurasian continents.\nMany glacial periods that have occurred during the last few million years are initially at 40,000-year frequency, but more recently ice ages have occurred at 100,000-year frequency."}

It is in the Podlaskie Plain on the banks of the Bia\u0142a River in the Podlaskie region, known collectively as the \"Green Lungs of Poland\".\nThe city charter dates back to 1692, but settlement activity in the area dates back to the 14th century. Bia\u0142ystok has traditionally been one of the leading center of academic, cultural and artistic life in Podlaskie and is the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. The location of the city in the neighborhood of Belarus, Lithuania and Russia, with convenient transportation connections, creates excellent conditions for economic and cultural development of the city. The geographical and historical conditions helped to foster Bia\u0142ystok as a place where people of different cultures, religions and nationalities lived together for centuries. It has shaped the specific character of the city \u2013 openness, friendliness and hospitality.\nAmong cities of Poland, Bia\u0142ystok is second in terms of population density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Bia\u0142ystok.\nHistory.\nThe city of Bia\u0142ystok has existed for five centuries. During all this time the fate of the city has passed between various political and economic forces. The various historically driven changes have had a very significant influence on the architectural space of the city. This activity relates to the fate of most other Polish cities, but the processes in Bia\u0142ystok had a particularly intense course. Numerous historic works of architecture no longer exist while many others have been rebuilt to their original configuration. The historic buildings of the city have not been preserved very well \u2013 the sights are merely an echo of the old historical shape of Bia\u0142ystok.\nOver the course of the last 200 years, the city has been the capital of numerous administrative divisions of a number of countries or occupying powers;\nSince 1999 it has been the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, Republic of Poland.\nGeography.\nBia\u0142ystok is in the Bia\u0142ystok Uplands () of the Podlaskie Plain (), part of what is known collectively as the \"Green Lungs of Poland\". The Bia\u0142a River, a left tributary of the Supra\u015bl River, passes through the city.\nThe landscape of the Bia\u0142ystok Upland is diverse, with high moraine hills in excess of above sea level. Vast areas of outwash are occupied by forests, which created a number of nature reserves including Knyszyn Forest, of which a portion exists within the city limits.\nThe city has a Warm Summer Continental climate (Dfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, which is characterized by warm temperatures during summer and long and frosty winters. It is substantially different from most of the other Polish lowlands. The region is one of the coldest in Poland, with the average temperature in January being . The average temperature in a year is . The number of frost days ranges from 50 to 60, with frost from 110 to 138 days and the duration of snow cover from 90 to 110 days. Mean annual rainfall values oscillate around , and the vegetation period lasts 200 to 210 days.\nDistricts and Metropolitan Region.\nThe city of Bia\u0142ystok is divided into 28 administrative units (Osiedla). The first 27 of these were created on October 25, 2004. The 28th, Dojlidy G\u00f3rne, was created on October 23, 2006, out of three settlements which had been incorporated into the city: Dojlidy G\u00f3rne, Kolonia Halickie, and Zag\u00f3rki.\nMetropolitan Bia\u0142ystok was designated by the Voivodeship of the Regulation No. 52/05 of 16 May 2005 in order to help economically develop the region. In 2006, the metropolitan area population was 450,254 inhabitants. It covers an area of . For one km2, there are about 265 people. Among urban residents are more women \u2013 100 men for every 108 women on average. The municipalities adjacent to Bia\u0142ystok are slowly losing their agricultural character, becoming residential suburban neighborhoods.\nDemographics.\nIn June 2009, the population of the city was 294,399. Among cities of Poland, Bia\u0142ystok is second in terms of population density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area.\nHistorically, Bia\u0142ystok has been a destination for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the Polish minority, there was a significant Jewish majority in Bia\u0142ystok. According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent). Bia\u0142ystok's pre-World War II Jewish population constituted about 63 percent of the city's total population of 107,000. World War II changed all of this. In 1939 ca. 107,000 persons lived in Bia\u0142ystok, but in 1946 \u2013 only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history. Currently the city's population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lipka Tartars, Ukrainians and Romani. Most of the modern-day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanization.\nGovernance.\nBia\u0142ystok, like other major cities in Poland, is a city county (\"powiat\"). The Bia\u0142ystok City Council has 28 elected members, one of whom is the mayor, or President of Bia\u0142ystok, elected every four years. The election of the City Council and of the local head of government, which takes place at the same time, is based on legislation introduced on 20 June 2002. The current President of Bia\u0142ystok, elected for his first term in 2006, is Tadeusz Truskolaski.\nIt is also the seat of government for the Podlaskie Voivodeship. The city is represented by several members of both houses of the Polish Parliament (Sejm and Senat). Bia\u0142ystok is represented by the Podlaskie and Warmian-Masurian constituency of the European Parliament.\nMilitary units.\nThe 18th Reconnaissance Regiment of the Polish Land Forces is based in Bia\u0142ystok. The heritage of the unit was the former 18th Territorial Defense Battalion and prior to that the former 18th Mechanized Brigade.\nThe Podlaska Cavalry Brigade was a military unit of the Polish Army, created on April 1, 1937. Its headquarters was in Bia\u0142ystok. It was formed from the Cavalry Brigade \"Bia\u0142ystok\", which existed between February 1929, and March 30, 1937. After the Soviet invasion of Poland, remnants of the Brigade fought both Wehrmacht and Red Army troops, surrendering on October 6, 1939.\nEconomy.\nIn the 19th century Bia\u0142ystok was an important center for light industry. This was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the 20th century, such as \"Fasty\" in the district of Bacieczki. However, after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down. Currently Bia\u0142ystok is a major center for the developed machine industry (electronics, machinery and metal), wood, alcoholic beverages, building materials, glass factory and power generation.\nThe city lies close to the Polish border with Lithuania and Belarus, with the nearest border checkpoint with Belarus in Bobrowniki only away. Since the border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area, the city is a center for trade from countries to the east.\nCulture.\nIn 2010, Bia\u0142ystok was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition to become a finalist for European Capital of Culture in 2016.\nBia\u0142ystok is the largest cultural center in north-eastern Poland. Museums include the Historical Museum, the Museum of Sculpture Alfons Karny, and the Bia\u0142ystok Village Museum.\nApproximately 32% of the city is occupied by green areas. Parks and squares and 1,779 ha of forest are located within the city which creates a unique and healthy climate. Within Bia\u0142ystok, there are two nature reserves with a total area of 105 ha, that are part of the Knyszyn Forest. Such a location of nature reserves in the immediate vicinity of the city is unique.\nSports.\nThe city has a number of sports teams, both professional and amateur, and a number of venues across the city. Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok is a Polish football club, based in Bia\u0142ystok, that plays in Ekstraklasa league at the Bia\u0142ystok City Stadium. In 2010, Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok won the Polish Cup and the Super Cup, and qualified to play in the third round qualification of the UEFA Europa League. A new 22,500 seat stadium is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.\nMedia.\nBia\u0142ystok has a wide variety of media outlets serving the city and surrounding region. There are two locally published newspapers in addition to two national papers with local bureaus. There are a number of national and locally produced television and radio channels available both over-the-air from the nearby RTCN Bia\u0142ystok (Krynice) Mast, the seventh highest structure in Poland, in addition to transmitter sites within the city and on the cable television network within the city.\nReligion.\nIn the early 1900s, Bia\u0142ystok was reputed to have the largest concentration of Jews of all the cities in the world. In 1931, 40,000 Jews lived in the city, nearly half the city's inhabitants.\nThe city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bia\u0142ystok. Establishment of the Diocese and the Archdiocese and the cities of Bia\u0142ystok ended the period of the temporary church administration in the Bia\u0142ystok region owned lands over the centuries to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vilnius, which after World War II remained in the Polish borders. The city is also the seat of the Bia\u0142ystok-Gda\u0144sk Diocese of the Polish Orthodox Church. Bia\u0142ystok is the largest concentration of Orthodox believers in Poland.\nTransport.\nThe city is, and has been for centuries, the main hub of transportation for the Podlaskie Voivodeship and the entire northeastern section of Poland. It is a major city on the European Union roadways and railways to the Baltic Republics and Finland. It is also a main gateway of trade with Belarus due to its proximity to the border and its current and longstanding relationship with Hrodno, Belarus. Passenger trains connect from Suvalki (Poland), Hrodno and Lithuania to Warsaw and the rest of the European passenger network. An extensive public transportation system is provided within the city by three bus services, but no tram or subway exists.\nA civil airport, Bia\u0142ystok-Krywlany Airport, lies within the city limits, but does not provide regularly scheduled service. There are plans to build a new regional airport, \"Bia\u0142ystok-Saniki Airport\", in the next few years that will provide flights within Europe.\nEducation.\nHigher education in the city can be traced back to the second half of the 18th century when the ownership of the city was inherited by Jan Klemens Branicki. As a patron of the arts and sciences, Branicki encouraged numerous artists and scientists to settle in Bia\u0142ystok to take advantage of Branicki's patronage. In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and Military Engineering, in the city.\nSince the fall of communism many private-funded institutions of higher educations were founded and their number is still increasing. Currently Bia\u0142ystok is home to one principal public university (University of Bia\u0142ystok) and two other public specialist universities (Bia\u0142ystok Technical University and Medical University of Bia\u0142ystok). Some institutions, such as Musical Academy in Bia\u0142ystok, are branches of their parent institutions in other cities, usually in Warsaw.\nNotable residents.\nOver the centuries Bia\u0142ystok has produced a number of persons who have provided unique contributions to the fields of science, language, politics, religion, sports, visual arts and performing arts. This environment was created in the mid-18th century by the patronage of Jan Klemens Branicki for the arts and sciences. A list of recent notable persons includes, but is not limited to:"}

Visual thinking or problem-solving is very ancient, and largely automatic. One only has to remember that the brain puts together an image of the world around us based on sensory input, mostly sight. We do not make any conscious decisions: it is done without conscious thought. Diagrams most likely \"tap in\" to some of these ancient \u2013 but largely unknown \u2013 routines.\nIn fact these normally hidden brain processes do sometimes become apparent. When brain damage affects the visual cortex, or when visual illusions are created, are two classic examples.\nThe way some diagrams affect thinking is quite important. Mendeleev's periodic table summarised previous research on the elements. Far more important, though, was the way it suggested the properties of elements which were \"not yet discovered\". This diagram stimulated creative thought, and other examples from the history of science could be given: see Feynman diagram.\nSome main diagram types.\nThere are at least the following types of diagrams:\nSchematics and other types of diagrams, e.g.,"}

In most cases, grindcore songs will be very short in length - Napalm Death's song 'You Suffer' is the shortest in the world at 1.316 seconds long. Their lyrics are similar to death metal and hardcore punk, which usually sing about pain, suffering, blood, gore or politics, injustice and revolution.\nOne popular grindcore band is Anal Cunt, who go by \"A.C.\" because their name has a sexual meaning. A.C. sings about racism, violence, and sexism. They produce very controversial songs such as 'You Were Pregnant So I Kicked You in the Stomach' and lyrics which make jokes of the Third Reich.\nThere are several offshoots of grindcore, including pornogrind, goregrind and deathgrind."}

Its area is 159,500 square kilometers. For Guyana, this area is divided into the six administrative regions of Barima-Waini, Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Pomeroon-Supenaam, Potaro-Siparuni, Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo and Essequibo Islands-West Demerara. \nSpain made its first claim on this area in a report dated 10 July 1788:\n\"It has been stated that the south coast of the Orinoco from the point of Barima, 20 leagues more or less inland, up to the creek of Curucima, is low lying and swampy land and, so, reckoning all this tract as useless, very few patches of fertile land being found therein, and hardly any savannahs and pastures, it is disregarded; so taking as chief base the said creek of Curucima, or the point of the chain and ridge in the great arm of the Imataka, an imaginary line will be drawn running to the south-south-east following the slopes of the ridge of the same name which is crossed by the Rivers Aguire, Arature and Amacuro, and others, in the distance of 20 leagues, direct to the Cuyuni; from there it will run on to the Masaruni and Essequibo, parallel to the sources of the Berbis and Surinama; this is the directing line of the course which the new Settlements and foundations proposed must follow.\"\nIn 1840, Venezuela claimed all of Guyana west of the Essequibo River \u2013 62% of what was then British Guiana. Britain and Venezuela argued over the boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela for much of the 19th century. On 21 February 1881, in a note to Lord Grenville, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Great Britain at that time, Venezuela suggested a border line starting from a point one mile to the north of the Moruka River, drawn from there westward to the 60th meridian, and running south along that meridian. This would have given the Barima District to Venezuela. The Government of Venezuela, in the case it made to the Arbitration Tribunal, changed its claim on the district just west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near where it meets the Mazaruni River, and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. Britain and Venezuela accepted the decision of the Tribunal in 1899.\nVenezuela raised the issue again in 1962, four years before Guyana won independence from Britain. At a meeting in Geneva in 1966, the two countries agreed to hear ideas from a representative of the UN Secretary General on ways to settle the dispute peacefully. There are still diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative.\nOn recognizing the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela said:\n\"Venezuela recognizes as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.\"\nVenezuelan maps drawn since 1970 show all the area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the \"Zone of Reclamation\"."}

Edward gave Sudeley Castle to his brother, who later became Richard III of England, who then gave it to his uncle Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford.\nBy the time Henry VIII of England succeeded, the castle was the property of the Crown again. It had been visited by Henry in 1535, with his second wife Anne Boleyn, but had been empty and unattended for some time. When Henry died the castle became the property of his son, Edward VI of England, who gave it to his uncle, Thomas Seymour. Thomas was made Lord of Sudeley and married the King's stepmother, Catherine Parr. During this time Thomas began to regenerate the castle for Catherine's use, but only one room that he had built remains today.\nSeymour and Catherine moved into the castle and brought with them ladies to attend on the Queen Dowager, as well as gentlemen of the household and Yeomen of the guard. The castle was then home to over 100 people. Another famous figure who came to live in the castle of Lady Jane Grey, who was a ward of Seymour's, as well as the young Elizabeth I of England.\nCatherine died after she had given birth to a daughter, Mary, at Sudeley Castle and was buried in its St. Mary's Chapel. Her grave was discovered in 1728 after the castle and the chapel had been left in ruins by the English Civil War. She was later reinterred by the Rector of Sudeley in 1817. \nSeymour's ambitions led to him being arrested and beheaded, after which Sudeley Castle became the property of Catherine's brother William Parr, who was the Marquess of Nothampton. Parr was stripped of his property and title after being involved in the failed attempt to make Lady Jane Grey Queen of England.\nIn 1554 Mary I of England gave Sudeley Castle John Brydges, Lord Chandos and it remained as his property throughout the reign of Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth was entertained three times at Sudeley Castle, which including a spectacular feast in 1592 to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada."}

In the United States \"omelets\" are usually eaten at breakfast. However omelettes can be eaten as a light lunch or late evening meal.\nMaking an Omelette.\nAn omelette is prepared from beaten eggs cooked with butter or oil in a frying pan. A thin, flat 'heavy' omelette is usually folded around a filling such as cheese, vegetables, meat, or some combination of these ingredients. In some traditions, omelettes are fried to cook the bottom and then flipped over or in half for final stage of cooking. However, in other traditions, omelettes is baked to cook it evenly or the top is cooked under a broiler. When making an omelette, it is best to use several eggs. Put a little water in with the eggs when you mix them up because the water helps the eggs to produce steam as they cook. The steam makes them lighter and fluffier. Using oil in the bottom of a nonstick omelette pan helps prevent the omelette from sticking. Follow these tips, add your favourite filling, and you will make a tasty omelette quickly and easily.\nFor a full light and fluffy omolette separate the egg whites and whisk to stiff peaks then fold in the yolks. Cook by frying in a knob of butter on a medium heat until centre starts to dry then fold in half and cook until its hot in the middle.\n\"Famous\" Omelettes.\nThere are many different types of omelette, often with different names, depending on what is used as a filling.\nArnold Bennett.\nArnold Bennett (27 May 1867 - 27 March 1931) was a British writer. Often after having been to the theatre in London he visited the Savoy Hotel's Grillroom. The chef added haddock, cream and Parmesan cheese to the basic omelette and called the new dish \"Omelette Arnold Bennett\" in his customer's honour.\nNapoleon.\nWhen Napoleon Bonaparte and his army were marching through southern France, they stopped for the night near the town of Bessieres. A local innkeeper made Napoleon an omelette. Napoleon was so impressed by the cooking he ordered the townspeople to collect all the eggs in the village and to prepare a huge omelette for his army the next day."}
{"id": "47751", "revid": "7841362", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47751", "title": "Visa", "text": "A visa (short for the Latin \"carta visa\", lit. \"the document having been seen\") is a permit given by a country that allows someone to go to that country. A visa is a document that is stamped on a person's passport by an embassy. It names the kind of visit and says how long the person can stay. Sometimes, people need to go through an interview held at the embassy before they get a visa.\nMany countries require foreign visitors to have a valid passport and a visa before they can enter the country, but there are exceptions (see below for examples of such these).\nVisas are associated with the request for permission to enter (or exit) a country, and are thus, for some countries, not the same as actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country.\nSome countries, such as some states of the former Soviet Union, require that their citizens, and sometimes foreign travelers, obtain an exit visa in order to be allowed to leave the country. Until 2004, foreign students in Russia were issued only an entry visa on being accepted to University there, and had to obtain an exit visa to return home. This policy has since been changed, and foreign students are now issued multiple entry (and exit) visa.\nConditions of issue.\nSome visas can be granted on arrival or by prior application at the country's embassy or consulate, or sometimes through a specialized travel agency with permission from the issuing country in the country of departure. If there is no embassy or consulate in one's home country, then one would have to travel to a third country (or apply by post) and try to get a visa issued there. The need for a visa generally depends on the citizenship of the applicant, how long the applicant plans to stay, and the activities that the applicant may wish to do in the country he visits. These may result different formal categories of visas, with different issue conditions.\nSome, but not all, countries have reciprocal visa regimes: if Country A requires citizens of Country B to have a visa to travel there, then Country B may apply reciprocity and require a visa from citizens of Country A. Likewise, if A allows B's citizens to enter without a visa, B may allow A's citizens to enter without a visa.\nExamples of such reciprocal visa regimes are between:\nA fee may be charged for issuing a visa; these are typically also reciprocal, so if country A charges country B's citizens 50 USD for a visa, country B will often also charge the same amount for country A's visitors. The fee charged may also be at the discretion of each embassy. A similar reciprocity often applies to the duration of the visa (the period in which one is permitted to request entry of the country) and the number of entries one can attempt with the visa. Expedited processing of the visa application for some countries will generally incur additional charges.\nThis reciprocal fee has become more common in recent years with the decision of the United States to charge nationals of various countries a $100 visa processing fee (non-refundable, even if a visa is not issued). A number of countries, including Brazil, Chile, and Turkey have reciprocated. Brazil requires an advance visa before entry into the country, and that a US citizen be fingerprinted and photographed on arrival\u2014matching U.S. requirements for Brazilians and other foreigners.\nThe issuing authority, usually a branch of the country's foreign ministry or department (e.g. U.S. State Department), and typically consular affairs officers, may request appropriate documentation from the applicant. This may include proof that the applicant is able to support himself in the host country (lodging, food), proof that the person hosting the applicant in his or her home really exists and has sufficient room for hosting the applicant, proof that the applicant has obtained health and evacuation insurance, etc. Some countries ask for proof of health status, especially for long-term visas; some countries deny such visas to persons with certain illnesses, such as AIDS. The exact conditions depend on the country and category of visa. Notable examples of countries requiring HIV tests of long-term residents are Russia and Uzbekistan. However, in Uzbekistan, the HIV test requirement is sometimes not strictly enforced. \nDeveloped countries frequently demand strong evidence of intent to return to the home country, if the visa is for a temporary stay, and especially if the applicant is from a developing country, due to immigration concerns.\nThe issuing authority may also require applicants to attest that they have had no criminal convictions, or that they do not partake in certain activities (like prostitution or drug trafficking). Some countries will deny visas if the travellers' passports show evidence of citizenship or travel to a country which is not recognized by that country. For example, Saudi Arabia will not issue visas to nationals of Israel or those with evidence of visiting Israel.\nTypes of visa.\nCommon types of visas are:\nLess common visas include:\nEntry and duration period.\nVisas can also be \"single-entry\", which means the visa is cancelled as soon as the holder leaves the country, \"double-entry\", or \"multiple-entry\", permitting multiple entries into the country with the same visa. Countries may also issue re-entry permits that allow temporarily leaving the country without invalidating the visa. Even a business visa will normally not allow the holder to work in the host country without an additional work permit.\nOnce issued, a visa will usually have to be used within a certain period of time.\nThe validity of a visa is not the same as the authorized period of stay in the issuing country. The visa validity usually indicates when the alien can apply for entry to the country. For example, if a visa has been issued January 1st and expires March 30th, and the typical authorized period of stay in a country is 90 days, then the 90-day authorized stay starts on the day the passenger reaches the country, which has to be between January 1st and March 30th. The traveller could therefore stay in the issuing country until June 1st. \nOnce in the country, the validity period of a visa or authorized stay can often be extended for a fee if the immigration authorities choose to do so. Staying longer than the period of authorized stay given by the immigration officers is considered illegal immigration even if the visa validity period is not over (i.e. for multiple entry visas) and a form of being \"out of status\" and the offender may be fined, prosecuted, deported, or even blacklisted (banned) from entering the country again. \nEntering a country without a valid visa or visa exemption may result in being arrested and removed (deportation or exclusion) from the country. Doing things that are not authorized by the status of entry (for example, working while having a non-worker tourist status) can result in the individual being deemed removable, in common speech an illegal alien. Such violation is not a violation of a visa, despite the common misuse of the phrase, but a violation of status, hence the term \"out of status.\"\nEven having a visa does not guarantee that somebody can enter ah ost country. The border crossing authorities make the final determination to allow entry, and may even cancel a visa at the border if the alien cannot demonstrate to their satisfaction that they will abide by the status their visa grants them.\nVisa and immigration laws may be very different among countries. As such, aliens are advised to check with immigration lawyers for visa and immigration laws governing the countries they wish to enter and eligibility to receive visas or other immigration benefits.\nVisa extensions.\nMany countries have a mechanism to allow the holder of a visa to apply to stay longer in that country. For example, in Denmark a visa holder can apply to the Danish Immigration Service for a Residence Permit after they have arrived in the Country. In the United Kingdom applications can be made to the Border and Immigration Agency. In certain circumstances, it is not possible for the holder of the visa to do this, either because the country does not have a mechanism to prolong visas or, most likely, because the holder of the visa is using a short stay visa to live in a country. In such cases, the holder often engages in what is known as a visa run; leaving the country for a short period in order to apply for a new visa prior to their return or so that they can be given a fresh permission to stay when they re-enter.\nVisa refusal.\nA visa may be denied for a number of reasons, including (but not limited to) if the applicant:\nVisa exemption schemes.\nPossession of a valid visa is a condition for entry into many countries, however various exemption schemes do exist. In some cases visa-free entry may be granted to holders of diplomatic passports even as visas are required by normal passport holders (\"see: Passport\").\nSome countries have reciprocal agreements such that a visa is not needed under certain conditions, e.g. when the visit is for tourism and for a relatively short period. One example of this is the Visa Waiver Program of the United States. Such reciprocal agreements may stem from common membership in international organizations or a shared heritage:\nOther countries may also unilaterally grant visa-free entry to nationals of certain countries in order to facilitate tourism.\nVisa-free travel between countries also occurs in all cases where passports are not needed for such travel. \nCommon visas.\nNormally, visas are valid for entry only into the country which issued the visa. Countries that are members of regional organizations or party to regional agreements may however issue visas valid for entry into some or all of the member states of the organization or agreement:"}

After losing his wife and son at an early age, he joined the Armenian freedom movement in the Ottoman Empire, and participated in various political parties.\nAndranik participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, within the Bulgarian army, alongside general Garegin Njdeh as a commander of Armenian auxiliary troops of 1912-1913. After his arrest and jailed; he spent some time in Istanbul. During World War I, he participated in the Caucasus Campaign and was appointed as general of the Armenian volunteer units of the Russian army. He participated in 20 different offensives where he gained fame due to his courage and the tactics he came up with to defeat the opposing forces.\nHe was the commanding officer of the Armenian volunteer units, which helped the Van Resistance take control of the Van on May 6, 1915. He helped re-capture the city from Ottoman forces during the Battle of Van. He was also the commander of the battalion that took the city of Bitlis (see: Battle of Bitlis) from the Ottoman forces that was under control of Mustafa Kemal. \nAfter declaration of Democratic Republic of Armenia (DRA), he organized volunteer units against the Ottoman army, and fought alongside those units. Declaration of Treaty of Batum was in diffuse as Andranik, was fighting against the Ottoman Empire with his army. He refused to accept the borders stated by the treaty. His activities were concentrated at the link between Ottoman Empire to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic at Karabakh, Zanghezur and Nakhichevan. Ozanian struck back at the Ottoman Fronts, Army of Islam.\nAndranik, tried several times to seize Shusha. Just before the Armistice of Mudros was signed, Andranik was on the way from Zangezur to Shusha, to control the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh. In January 1919 Armenian troops advancing, the British forces (Lionel Dunsterville) ordered Andranik back to Zangezur, and gave him the assurances that this conflict can be solved with the Paris Peace Conference, of 1919.\nIn 1919 he left Armenia in order not to take part in the political struggles for power in the recent Republic of still those its opinions contradicting policy to carry Armenia for the last time and went oneself into exile to Fresno, California, United States.\nHe immigrated to Fresno, California.

None of the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain had any written language, so their history, culture and way of life are known only through archaeological finds.\nThe first written record of Britain and its inhabitants was by the Greek navigator Pytheas, who explored the coastal region of Britain around 325 BC. Ancient Britons were however involved in extensive trade and cultural links with the rest of Europe from the Neolithic onward, especially in exporting tin.\nThe Paleolithic.\nPalaeolithic Britain is the period from almost 750,000 years ago until around 10,000 years ago. This huge length of time saw many changes in the environment, several glacial and interglacial periods which greatly affected human settlement in the region.\nLower Paleolithic.\nThere is evidence from bones and flint tools found in coastal deposits near Happisburgh in Norfolk and Bakersfield in Suffolk that \"Homo erectus\" was present in what is now Britain around 700,000 years ago. At this time, southern and eastern Britain was linked to continental Europe by a wide land bridge allowing humans to move freely. The current position of the English Channel was a large river flowing westwards and fed by tributaries that would later become the Thames and Seine.\nThe extreme cold of the following Anglian glaciation is likely to have driven humans out of Britain altogether. A warmer time period lasted from around 300,000 until 200,000 years ago. The more advanced flint technology permitted more efficient hunting.\nThere is little evidence of human occupation during the subsequent Ipswichian interglacial between around 130,000 and 110,000 years ago.\nUpper Paleolithic.\nNeanderthal occupation of Britain was limited and by 30,000 BC the first signs of modern human (Homo sapiens) activity. The most famous example from this period is the burial of the Red Lady of Paviland in modern-day Wales. A final ice age covered Britain between around 70,000 and 10,000 years ago with an extreme cold snap between 22,000 and 13,000 years ago which may have driven humans south out of Britain altogether. The environment during this ice age period would have been a largely treeless tundra, eventually replaced by a warmer climate, perhaps reaching 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 Fahrenheit) in summer which encouraged the expansion of birch trees as well as shrub and grasses.\nThe dominant food species were the Wild Horse (\"Equuleus fetus\") and Red Deer (\"Corvus elapses\") although other mammals ranging from hares to mammoth were also hunted.\nBy 10,500 years ago the climate was becoming cooler and dryer. Food animal populations seem to have declined although woodland coverage expanded. Tool manufacture in the Final Upper Paleolithic revolved around smaller flints and bone and antler work became less common. However, the number of known sites is much larger and more widely spread. Many more open air sites are known such as that at Hengistbury Head.\nMesolithic.\nAround 10,000 years ago the ice age finally ended. Temperatures rose, probably to levels similar to those today, and forests expanded farther. By 8,500 years ago, the rising sea levels caused by the melting glaciers cut Britain off from continental Europe for the last time. The warmer climate changed the Arctic environment to one of pine, birch, and alder forest.\nThe Mesolithic-Neolithic transition.\nFarming of both crops and domestic animals was adopted in Britain around 4,500 BC at least partly because of the need for reliable food sources.\nThe Neolithic.\nTraditionally the arrival of the Neolithic in Britain has been seen as a wave of immigration from the continent. Modern archaeology now considers that farming along with pottery and settled living was in fact adopted by the native population who were related to the similarly newly-farming Neolithic people across the water. Links with continental Europe are demonstrated by finds of axes made from exotic stone such as jadeite.\nAnalysis of the mitochondrial DNA of modern European populations shows that over 80% are descended in the female line from European hunter-gatherers. Less than 20% are descended in the female line from Neolithic farmers from the Middle East. In 1997 DNA analysis was undertaken on a tooth from a Mesolithic man whose remains were found in Sough's Cave at Cheddar Gorge. His mitochondrial DNA was of a type found in 11% of modern European populations.\nSuch findings have cast doubt on the traditional view of successive waves of mass immigration annihilating earlier peoples.\nIn any case, the Neolithic Revolution, as it is called, introduced a more settled way of life and ultimately led to societies becoming divided into differing groups of farmers, artisans and leaders.\nThe construction of the earliest earthwork sites in Britain began during the early Neolithic (c. 4400 BC- 3300 BC) in the form of long barrows used for communal burial.\nThe Middle Neolithic (c. 3300 BC-c. 2900 BC) saw the development of cursus monuments close to earlier barrows. The earliest stone circles and individual burials also appear.\nNew enclosures, called henges were built, along with stone rows and the famous sites of Stonehenge and Silbury Hill reached their peak. Industrial flint mining such as that at Cissbury and Grimes Graves began.\nThe Bronze Age.\nIn around 2,700 BC a new culture arrived in Britain, often referred to as the Beaker culture. Beaker pottery appears in the Mount Pleasant Phase (2,700 BC - 2,000 BC) along with flat axes and burial practices of inhumation. The megalithic phases of Stonehenge date to this period.\nBritain had large reserves of tin in the areas of Cornwall and Devon in what is now southwest England, and thus tin mining began. By around 1,600 BC the southwest of Britain had a trade boom as British tin was exported across Europe.\nThe Beaker people were also skilled at making ornaments from gold, and examples of these have been found in graves of the wealthy Wessex culture of southern Britain.\nThe Iron Age.\nIn around 750 BC iron working techniques reached Britain from southern Europe. Iron was stronger and more plentiful than bronze, and its introduction marks the beginning of the Iron Age. Iron working revolutionised many aspects of life, most importantly agriculture. Iron tipped ploughs could churn up land far more quickly and deeply than older wooden or bronze ones, and iron axes could clear forest land far more efficiently for agriculture.\nAbout 900 BC, British society changed again. The Celtic culture had by 500 BC covered most of the British Isles. The Celts were highly skilled craftsmen and produced nicely patterned gold jewellery and weapons in bronze and iron.\nIron Age Britons lived in organised tribal groups, ruled by a chieftain.\nAs people became more numerous, fights broke out between opposing tribes. This led to the building of hill forts. The first had been built about 1,500 BC. Britain exported hunting dogs, animal skins and slaves.\nLate pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA).\nThe last centuries before the Roman invasion saw refugees from Gaul (modern day France and Belgium) known as the Belgae, who were displaced as the Roman Empire expanded.\nFrom around 175 BC they settled in the areas of Kent, Hertfordshire and Essex and brought with them pottery making skills far more advanced than anything produced previously. The Belgae were partially Romanised and were responsible for creating the first settlements large enough to be called towns.\nAbout 100 BC, iron bars began to be used as currency, coinage was developed, based on continental types.\nAs the Roman Empire expanded northwards, Rome began to take interest in Britain. See Roman Britain for the history of this period."}

Only some small villages in the countryside are not in the book. Major cities like London and Winchester are also not in the Domesday Book, perhaps because of their size, or because (not owning land), the people could not be taxed. \nThe Domesday book gave the names of King William's friends and even listed the number of pigs on a piece of land. But it was not like a modern census. It did not give the names of all the people. It listed the heads of each household, but left out Londoners, monks, nuns, and anyone living in castles. In effect, it listed only people he could get rent from, and who might supply men to fight in his army.\nVolumes.\nThe Domesday Book is two volumes. One of the books was called \"Great Domesday\", and the other was called \"Little Domesday\". The draft of the second volume, Little Domesday, was never worked up, but no doubt was used for tax collection just the same.\nName.\nThe Domesday book got its name because its lists were so complete that it reminded people of the Last Judgment (which people also call Doomsday, or Domesday) in Christianity, when lists of what people have done go before God for people to be judged."}

It happened in Dahlerau, Radevormwald, North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany.\nEvents.\nA passenger train carrying pupils was travelling on the railway track from Wuppertal to Radevormwald in North Rhine-Westphalia in West Germany on the evening of 27 May 1971. The pupils belonged to the final year of a school in Radevormwald and were returning from a trip to Bremen. Around 21:00, the train had just left the railway station in \"Wuppertal-Beyenburg\" and was a few minutes away from the railway station in \"Dahlerau\". Farther south, a freight train was traveling from Radevormwald to Wuppertal, and had just arrived outside the Dahlerau station. The freight train would have to wait in the station to allow the passenger train to pass. This was necessary because the passenger train was 30 minutes late and there was only one track on the railway line outside the station.\nThe dispatcher in the station would have to go outside and show a red lantern to the freight train, because there were no signals in the station. Nobody knows for sure what happened, but the freight train went right through the station and onto the track where the passenger train was running. The driver of the freight train later told that the dispatcher in the station had shown him a green light. This was the signal not to stop.\nThe dispatcher had seen what happened and tried to hold the train back with emergency signals, but he failed and the train disappeared behind a curve. He went into his office to call the station in Wuppertal-Beyenburg, but the passenger train had already left Beyenburg. The dispatcher knew what would happen, and called the police. Meanwhile, about 800 metres north of the station, the two trains crashed. The passenger train was crushed to 1/3 of its length, because it consisted of light railbuses and the freight train locomotive was five times as heavy.\nPolice, firefighters and ambulances arrived quickly, but had problems rescuing people. This was because the crash happened on a hillside. The parents of the pupils had also heard of the accident and had come to search for their children. In all, 25 people were injured, many of them badly. 46 people died in the accident. Of these 46, 41 were pupils, two teachers, one was a mother who travelled with the children, and two were working for the railway. Only one person walked away from the accident without injuries. So many people had died that the bodies had to be put in a gymnasium.\nAfter the accident.\nThe dispatcher was killed in a car accident a few weeks after the crash. Police said it was not suicide. Because the dispatcher could not be asked, investigating the crash was difficult and took about a year. In the end, it was decided that human error was the cause for the accident. Nobody could find out the exact happenings on that evening, and so the case never went before a court. The passenger train was badly damaged and had to be destroyed. The locomotive of the freight train was repaired and stayed in service until 2001.\nThe victims were buried on 2 June 1971. More than 10,000 people attended the funeral, and all shops in Radevormwald were closed on that day. Many important people went to the funeral, including Chancellor Willy Brandt, and the Minister of Transport. The victims were buried together in a large grave on the Radevormwald cemetery. Later, a memorial was built near the graves as well.\nThe Deutsche Bundesbahn, the company who was responsible for the railway, changed the lanterns used by the dispatchers. They would not show a red light any more, so that red and green could not be confused any more. They also built the successors of the type of railbus that crashed sturdier, because some people said they had been built too light.\nThe line from Wuppertal to Radevormwald was closed in 1976."}

Its first people were Austronesians with small numbers of Chinese. After the arrival of the Dutch in the 1600s, many Chinese moved to Taiwan to work. Few European people moved to Taiwan, and the native people married with Chinese or moved away from the west side of the island. When the Qing dynasty began in China, a supporter of the old Ming dynasty hid in Taiwan. Eventually the Qing came to Taiwan, defeated him, and added Taiwan to China. \nTaiwan remained Chinese territory through most of the Qing dynasty until it was taken by Japan in 1895. Taiwan became a colony of Japan for fifty years until the end of World War Two. For a brief time it was under the control of China through the Guomindang government, but that government lost a civil war and moved to Taiwan. The rule of the Guomindang is considered controversial today. Some criticize its treatment of the people of Taiwan, but others focus on positive political and economic change that it made. \nIn the 1980s, the government became more democratic. This has also been controversial because it allows different political parties to compete. The Democratic Progressive Party gained influence. During this time, Taiwan has officially been called the Republic of China but has acted independently of China. The People's Republic of China demands that Taiwan must become a part of China, while most Taiwanese debate the appropriate political status for today. These perspectives make complications in the politics of Taiwan.\nPrehistoric Taiwan.\nThe original people to move to Taiwan can be called the Aboriginal people. They have many similarities with others societies called Austronesian. Chinese historians have mentioned Taiwan several times since its Three Kingdoms period, although it was considered a land of barbarians.\nAbout 50000 years ago was called the \"Old Stone Age\" in Taiwan. At that time, people hit rocks against each other to make tools. The most famous culture of Taiwanese old stone age is Changping Culture. The Changping culture's monument is the Eight Gods' Hole Monument in Taitung Conty.\nAbout 5000 years ago was the \"New Stone Age\". People in New Stone Age sharpened stones to make tools. We can take New Stone Age into three parts. The most famous cultures are the Tapenken culture, the Beinan culture, and the Yuanshan culture. The Tapenken culture monument is the Tapenken Monument (also known as T.P.K.) in Taipei, the Beinan culture's monument is the Puyuma Relics in Taitung Conty, and the Yuanshan culture's monument is the Yuanshan Monument in Taipei City.\nAbout 2000 years ago was the \"Metal Age\". In the Metal Age, people used metal to make tools, and started trading. The most famous culture in Metal Age is the Thirteen Hangs Cultures. Its monument is the Thirteen Hangs Monument in Taipei County.\nDutch Taiwan.\nIn the 17th century, the Dutch took control of Taiwan. During this time, it was a Dutch colony and it encouraged Chinese people to move there. Few Chinese had lived on Taiwan until this time. As more Chinese moved to Taiwan there was conflict with the Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal people either married with Chinese or moved away from the west of Taiwan. During the time of Dutch control, Spain also briefly held northern Taiwan but the Dutch removed them in 1642. \nQing Dynasty.\nIn 1644, the Qing Dynasty began ruling China, and Ming Dynasty's courtier, Koxinga landed Taiwan, removed the Dutch, and ruled Taiwan. He turned it into a place to resist the Qing Dynasty. This period is called \"the period of Ming Zheng\", or the Kingdom of Tungning, the Kingdom of Yanping. One year later, the Qing Dynasty ended the Kindom of Tungning. The Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan for 212 years until 1895. \nJapanese Rule.\nJapan first showed interest in Taiwan in the 1870s. It tested the strength of the Qing Dynasty's control in 1871. Some ship-wrecked Okinawan fishermen were killed by Aboriginal people in southern Taiwan and Japan demanded compensation. Okinawa had secretly paid tribute to both China and Japan. In this situation Japan claimed Okinawa was part of Japan and it must protect its own people. There was no war but China stated it could not control barbarian people. Japan used this excuse to demand Taiwan after it defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War. Taiwanese people rebelled without the support of China and created the Republic of Formosa that lasted for about one year. Japan crushed Taiwanese resistance, but it was the beginning of Taiwanese nationalism.\nGuomindang Rule.\nIn 1945, the Republic of China won the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Allied Powers agreed to divide the territory of the Japanese Empire, and Taiwan would be returned to Chinese control. The Chinese civil war occurred at this time, and in 1949 the Guomindang lost and escaped to Taiwan. Taiwan was ruled by this one party until democratic reforms began in the 1980s."}

{"id": "47828", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47828", "title": "Katana", "text": "A katana is a Japanese long sword used by samurai warriors. It is the most important sword of the three swords worn by samurai: katana, wakizashi, and tanto. The katana was popular from 1400 A.D. until 1876, when the samurai were abolished as a social class. \nIn Japanese, \"katana\" means a \"long sword\" and it represents a blade, which is a little curved, with a single edge and a very sharp point. \nTypes.\nThere are several types of katanas:\nForging and polishing.\nA traditional katana is made of a type of high carbon steel called tamahagane, which is made by smelting a type of Japanese iron ore, called iron sand, in a large furnace called a tatara.\nThis steel is sent to a smith who breaks it down to small pieces and layers the steel according to carbon content, they smelt this in their forge and repeatedly fold the steel in order to homogenise it. The most important part of the forging is the tempering, when the sword is quench-hardened. In ancient times it was said that the soul of the sword was put into the katana at this point. The sword is sometimes given a rough polish by the smith and then sent to a professional polisher for polishing (usually to a mirror finish). After polishing, the sword to be fitted.\nToday katanas are mainly made of carbon steel of different quality. But there are some swords made of zinc and aluminum alloys, which are able to resist some external forces and are only used for decoration or non-tameshigiri practice. To determine the quality of a katana it is enough to check its \"resistance\" (how much it bends when it is hit), \"elasticity\" (the ability of katana to return to its original shape), and the \"endurance\" of the blade after striking (how long it lasts).\nWearing and use.\nGenerally, katana is designed for cutting, but it was widely used for stabbing too. This depended mainly on the length of the tang (the handle). The katana could be easily used for cutting if it was made for using with both hands. It was used for stabbing when the katana was made for using with one hand. \nAs a rule, katana was worn under the belt on the left side of a right-handed man. The sword was in its sheath or scabbard (the cover), with its blade facing up. That way the sword could be drawn and cut the opponent in one movement. Alternatively, the scabbard might be held freely in the left hand: in action the sword would be drawn and the scabbard thrown down. This allows for free movement in battle.\nTo pull the katana a few inches out of its scabbard was an aggressive move signalling willingness to fight.\nKatana and Japanese tradition.\nThe Katana was very important in Japanese society. This sword was thought to be the \"soul\" of its master. Only a samurai was allowed to have a katana. A simple man with a katana sword could be killed at once. \nThere was a tradition of wearing, taking care and taking the katana out of its scabbard. Samurai kept their katana on a special stand for swords, called katana-kake. This stand was used for both katana and wakizashi. The blade had to have its point up, just as when wearing the sword; the handle (called the tang) had to be turned to the let. This made katana available for handling any time it was needed. \nThe art of handling a katana was developed in martial arts like \"kenjutsu\" and \"iaijutsu\". Today, this art is practiced in \"iaido\" and \"kendo\" martial arts. The last one is the art of dueling with bamboo or wooden sword. Old schools of handling katana swords still exist. The most famous are: \"Kashima Shin-ryu, Kashima Shinto-ryu, Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu\". \nThe most appreciated technique of handling a katana is a school called \"Nitto Ryu\". This school taught how to use both a katana and a wakizashi during a fight. The most famous samurai who improved this art was \"Miyamoto Musashi\"."}

He was brought from Iona off the west coast of Scotland to Northumbria around AD 635 by King Oswald of Northumbria. It became the base for Christian evangelising in the North of England and also sent a successful mission to Mercia. Monks from the community of Iona settled on the island.\nNorthumberland's patron saint, Saint Cuthbert, was a monk and later Abbot of the monastery, and his miracles and life are recorded by the Venerable Bede. Cuthbert later became Bishop of Lindisfarne.\nIn the early 700s the famous illuminated manuscript known as the Lindisfarne Gospels (an illustrated Latin copy of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) was made, probably at Lindisfarne.\nLater, a monk named Aldred added an Anglo-Saxon translation to the Latin text. This made (late 10th century) the earliest surviving Old English copies of the Gospels.\nHistory.\nIn 793 a Viking raid on Lindisfarne scared many people throughout the Christian West. The year 793 is often called the beginning of the age of Viking raids. A very famous passage in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reads:\n\"In this year fierce, foreboding omens came over the land of Northumbria. There were excessive whirlwinds, lightning storms, and fiery dragons were seen flying in the sky. These signs were followed by great famine, and on January 8th of the same year, the ravaging of heathen men destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne.\"\nEventually the monks fled the island. They took with them the body of St Cuthbert, which is now buried at Durham Cathedral. The priory was re-established in Norman times as a Benedictine house and continued until its dissolution in 1536 under Henry VIII. It is now a ruin in the care of English Heritage, who also run a museum/visitor centre nearby. The neighbouring parish church (see below) is still in use.\nLindisfarne also has the small castle, based on a Tudor fort and open to visitors.\nJ.M.W.

The region of Tamil Nadu (now one of the states in the south of the Republic of India) has been under continuous human habitation since prehistoric times.\nOverview.\nThe civilisation of the Tamil people is among the oldest in the world and has been influenced by, influenced, and coexisted with many external cultures.\nThe three Tamil dynasties of Chera, Chola and Pandya were all of ancient origins. Together they ruled over Tamil Nadu with a unique culture and language, contributing to the growth of \"Sangam Literature\", some of the oldest literature in the world.\nThey had extensive oversee trade contacts with the Roman and Greek empires later on. These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other as they wanted hegemony over the land.\nInvasion by the Kalabhras during the third century disturbed the tradition, and order of the land by displacing the three traditional ruling dynasties. These occupiers were overthrown by the Pandyas and the Pallavas, who restored the kingdoms. The Cholas, who came back from obscurity in the ninth century by defeating the Pallavas and the Pandyas, rose to become a great power and extended their empire over the entire southern peninsula. At its height the Chola empire had spread from Bengal in the northeast to Sri Lanka in the south. The Chola navy held sway over the Sri Vijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia.\nRapid changes in the political situation of the rest of India occurred due to the incursions of Muslim armies from the northwest marked a turning point in the history of Tamil Nadu. With the decline of the three ancient dynasties during the fourteenth century, the Tamil country became part of the Vijayanagara Empire. Under this empire the Telugu speaking Nayak governors ruled the Tamil land. The brief appearance of the Marathas gave way to the European trading companies, who began to appear during the seventeenth century and eventually assumed greater sway over the indigenous rulers of the land. The Madras Presidency comprising of most of southern India including what is now Tamil Nadu, was created in the eighteenth century and was ruled directly by the British East India Company. After the independence of India by Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi, the Tamil Nadu state was created based on linguistic boundaries, due to a Telugu man who wished the Telugu speaking land bordering Tamil Nadu to become its own state, which it did, Andra Pradesh was born. This caused a chain reaction because the other languages also wanted their own states. This led to state boundaries because of linguistic reasons, and gave birth to many other linguisticly devised states, including Tamil Nadu.\nPre-historic period.\nAlthough there is very little concrete historical evidence that has been found so far for the period prior to 600 BCE, the history of the Tamil people probably predates this period. Various legends became prevalent after the 5th century BCE regarding the antiquity of the Tamil people. According to \"Iraiyanar Agapporul\", a 3rd/5th century CE annotation on the Sangam literature, the Tamil country extended southwards beyond the natural boundaries of the Indian peninsula comprising of 49 ancient \"nadus\" (divisions). The land was supposed to have been destroyed by a deluge. The Sangam legends also added to the antiquity of the Tamil people by claiming tens of thousands of years of continuous literary activity during three \"Sangams\". However, there have been no direct archaeological finds supporting these legends.\nThe prehistoric period during which the Palaeolithic civilisations existed in the Tamil Nadu region has been estimated to span the period from about 50,000 BCE until around 3000 BCE. For most part of the lower Palaeolithic stage, humans lived close to river valleys with sparse forest cover or in grassland environments. The population density was very low and so far only two localities of this lower Palaeolithic culture have been found in south India. One of these is in Attirampakkam valley in the northwest of Chennai in Tamil Nadu. Archaeological research has uncovered evidence of fossil remains of animals and primitive stone implements around the northern Tamil Nadu that could be dated to belong to around 300,000 BCE. Humans in South India, belonging to the species of \"Homo erectus\", lived in this primitive 'old stone age' (Palaeolithic) for quite a long time, using only crude implements such as hand axes and choppers and subsisting on food he hunted and gathered instead of actively growing it according to his needs.\nThe ancestor of modern humans (\"Homo sapiens sapiens\") who appeared around 50,000 years ago was more developed and could fabricate thinner flake tools and blade-like tools using a variety of stones. From about 10,000 years ago, humans made still smaller tools called Microlithic tools. The material used by the early humans to make these tools were jasper, agate, flint, quartz, etc. In 1949, researchers found such microliths in Tirunelveli district.\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Neolithic period had its advent around 2500 BCE. Humans of the Neolithic period made their stone tools in finer shapes by grinding and polishing. The Neolithic humans lived mostly on small flat hills or on the foothills in small, more or less permanent settlements but for periodical migration for grazing purposes. They gave the dead proper burials within urns or pits. They were also starting to use copper for making certain tools or weapons.\nHumans started using iron for making tools and weapons. The Iron Age culture in peninsular India is marked by Megalithic burial sites, which are found in several hundreds of places.\nEarly history (500 BCE \u2013 300 CE).\nAncient Tamil Nadu contained three monarchical states, headed by kings called \"Ventar\" and several tribal chieftaincies, headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination \"Vel\" or \"Velir\". During the third century BCE, the Deccan was part of the Mauryan kingdom, and from the middle of the first century BCE to second century CE the same area was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty. The Tamil area had an independent existence outside the control of these northern empires.\nThe names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Keralaputras or Cheras are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273\u2013232 BCE) inscriptions, where they are mentioned among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.\nKarikala Chola was the most famous early Chola. He is mentioned in a number of poems in the Sangam poetry.\nPandyas ruled initially from Korkai, a sea port on the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. Pandyas are also mentioned in Sangam Literature, as well as by Greek and Roman sources during this period. The early Pandyas went into obscurity at the end of the third century CE during the incursion of the Kalabhras.\nThe kingdom of the Cheras comprised of the modern state of Kerala, along the western or Malabar Coast of southern India. Their proximity to the sea favoured trade with Africa.\nInternal and external trade was well organised and active.\nInterregnum (300 \u2013 600).\nAfter the close of the Sangam era, from about 300 to about 600 CE, there is an almost total lack of information regarding occurrences in the Tamil land. Some time about 300 CE, the whole region was upset by the appearance of the Kalabhras. These people are described in later literature as 'evil rulers' who overthrew the established Tamil kings and got a strangle hold of the country. They did not leave many artefacts or monuments. The only source of information on them is the scattered mentions in Buddhist and Jain literature.\nJainism and Buddhism, took deep roots in the society, giving birth to a large body of ethical poetry.\nWriting became very widespread and \"vatteluttu\" evolved from the Tamil-Brahmi became a mature script for writing Tamil.\nAge of empires (600 - 1300).\nThe medieval period of the history of the Tamil country saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, some of whom went on to the extent of empires, exerting influences both in India and overseas. \nThe Hindu sects Saivism and Vaishnavism became more dominant, with temples being built and Dravidian architecture being supported by empires replacing the significance of Nastik Jainism and Buddhism of the previous era. Some of the output of villages throughout the kingdom was given to temples that reinvested some of the wealth accumulated as loans to the settlements.\nTamil script replaced the \"vatteluttu\" script throughout Tamil Nadu for writing Tamil. Both secular and religious literature flourished during the period.\nPallavas.\nThe seventh century Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I and his son \"Mamalla\" Narasimhavarman I. The Pallavas were not a recognised political power before the second century. After the fall of the Satavahanas, they began to get control over parts of Andhra and the Tamil country. The Pallavas were at their finest during the reigns of Narasimhavarman I and \"Pallavamalla\" Nandivarman II.\nDuring the sixth and the seventh centuries, the western Deccan saw the rise of the Chalukyas based in Vatapi. The Pallavas had the more difficult existence of the two as they had to fight on two fronts - against the Pandyas as wells as the Chalukyas.\nPandyas.\nPandya Kadungon (560 - 590) is credited with the overthrow of the Kalabhras in the south. Pandya Cendan extended their rule to the Chera country. His son Arikesari Parantaka Maravarman (c. 650 - 700) had a long and prosperous rule. He fought many battles and extended the Pandya power.\nAfter some decades of expansion, the Pandya kingdom was large enough to pose a serious threat to the Pallava power.\nThe Pandya power continued to grow under Srimara and encroached further into the Pallava territories. \nCholas.\nAround 850 rose Vijayalaya, made use of an opportunity arising out of a conflict between Pandyas and Pallavas, captured Thanjavur and eventually established the imperial line of the medieval Cholas. Vijayalaya revived the Chola dynasty and his son Aditya I helped establish their independence. He invaded Pallava kingdom in 903 and killed the Pallava king Aparajita in battle, ending the Pallava reign. The Chola kingdom under Parantaka I expanded to cover the entire Pandya country. However towards the end of his reign he suffered several reverses by the Rashtrakutas who had extended their territories well into the Chola kingdom.\nThe Cholas went into a temporary decline during the next few years due to weak kings, palace intrigues and succession disputes.\nEuropean colonisation (1650 - 1850).\nEuropean settlements began to appear in the Tamil country during the Vijayanagara Empire. In 1605, the Dutch established trading posts in the Coromandel Coast near Gingee and in Pulicat. The British East India Company built a 'factory' (warehouse) at Armagaon (Durgarazpatnam), a village around 35 miles North of Pulicat, as the site in 1626. \nAnglo French Conflicts.\nThe conflict between the British and the French had as result in 1765 the Emperor of Delhi issued a \"firman\" (decree) recognizing the British possessions in southern India.\nBritish Government Control.\nAlthough the Company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was getting clearer day by day that the Company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. In 1784 Pitt's India Act made the Company subordinate to the British Government.\nThe next few decades were of rapid growth and expansion in the territories controlled by the English. The Anglo-Mysore Wars of 1766 to 1799, the Anglo-Maratha Wars of 1772 andPolygar Wars of 1800-1805 Dheeran chinnamalai,the Tamil king won three polygar wars against Britishers and at last he was hanged along with his two brothers.Then Britishers took entire control of Tamil Nadu by settling east India company after the death of chinnamalai the brave Tamil king.\nEnd of Company rule.\nThe discontent in the various districts of the company territories exploded in 1857 into the Sepoy war. Although the rebellion had a huge impact on the state of the colonial power in India, Tamil Nadu was mostly unaffected by it. \nBritish rule (1850 \u2013 1947).\nIn 1858 the British Crown assumed direct rule in India.\nFailure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in a severe famine in the Madras Presidency during 1876 - 1877.The government instituted a famine insurance grant, setting aside 1.5 million Rupees. Other civic works such as canal building and improvements in roads and railway were also undertaken to minimise effects of any future famines.\nIndependence struggle.\nThe growing desire for independence began to gradually gather pace in the country and its influence in Tamil Nadu generated a number of volunteers to the fight against the British colonial power in the struggle for Independence. Notable amongst these are Tiruppur Kumaran, who was born in 1904 in a small village near Erode. Kumaran lost his life during a protest march against the British.\nIn 1916 Dr. T.M. Nair and Rao Bahadur Thygaraya Chetty released the \"Non-Brahmin Manifesto\" sowing the seeds for the Dravidian movements.\nPost Independence period.\nThe trauma of the partition did not impact Tamil Nadu when India was granted Independence in 1947. There was no sectarian violence against various religions. There had always been an atmosphere of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between all religions in Tamil Nadu. Congress formed the first ministry in the Madras Presidency. Rajaji was the first Chief Minister. Madras Presidency was eventually reconstituted as Madras State.\nThe Madras state was named Tamil Nadu (the land of the Tamils) in 1968.\nEthnic conflict in Sri Lanka during the 1970s and the 80s saw large numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils fleeing to Tamil Nadu. \nEvolution of regional politics.\nThe politics of Tamil Nadu have gone through three distinct phases since independence. The domination of the Congress Party after 1947 gave way to the Dravidian populist mobilisation in the 1960s. This phase lasted until towards the end of the 1990s. The most recent phase saw the fragmentation of the Dravidian political parties and led to the advent of political alliances and coalition governments."}

Electronic amplifiers make a signal from a radio or electric musical instrument (such as an electric guitar or an electric bass guitar) louder and stronger. Amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers. This includes televisions, radios, computers, and mp3 players, to name a few.\nAmplifiers ability to use low impedance speakers may vary. Typical impedance is 8 ohms.\nClassification can be done by current loss when amplifier is on but does not get signal. Example: A-class amplifier takes more current without signal than B-class amplifier but A-class amplifier have smaller distortion.\nThere is also several distortion types. \nHow it works.\nElectronic amplifiers make a signal from the radio or electric instrument louder and stronger by using transistors or vacuum tubes. Electronic amplifiers have to be connected to electrical current or a battery to work. Once the signal from the radio or electric instrument has been made louder and stronger, the signal needs to be connected to a loudspeaker so that people can hear it.\nWhen an amplifier tries to make the sound louder than it can, it adds distortion to the sound. Some amplifiers are made to add controlled distortion. Distortion from transistors sounds different than distortion from tubes. Distortion from tubes is often said to be more musical. Because of all this, more expensive amplifiers often add controlled distortion with tubes. Many of these amplifiers use transistors for a \"clean\" sound (without distortion).\nHistory.\nFrom the 1920s until the 1950s, electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes. However, electronic amplifiers with vacuum tubes were heavy, and they produced a lot of heat. They also broke down a lot. \nSince the 1960s, most electronic amplifiers have been built with transistors. Transistors are lighter, cheaper, and more reliable."}

For a loudspeaker to produce sound, the signal from the radio, television set, or electric musical instrument needs to be connected to an electronic amplifier. \nLoudspeakers are usually built by using a stiff paper cone, a coil of thin copper wire, and a circular magnet. The cone, copper wire, and magnet are usually mounted in a rectangle-shaped wood cabinet. The coil of copper wire moves back and forth when an electrical signal is passed through it. The coil of copper wire and the magnet cause the rigid paper cone to vibrate and reproduce sounds.\nInside the loudspeaker can be a audio crossover.\nTypes of loudspeakers.\nSome loudspeakers are designed for lower-pitched sounds, such as \"woofer\" loudspeakers or \"subwoofer\" loudspeakers. Other loudspeakers, which are called \"tweeters\", are designed to reproduce high-pitched sounds (such as the sound of a whistle or a bird singing).\nLoudspeakers for electric musical instruments are usually much stronger and heavier than loudspeakers for radios or television sets. Their main function is to convert electrical signals given to it into sound signals.\nHistory.\nAlexander Graham Bell invented the first audible loudspeaker in 1876. Bell invented the loudspeaker because he needed a device that would amplify sound for the telephone. In 1878, the inventor Werner von Siemens from Germany patented an improved type of electrodynamic loudspeaker which did not yet include an amplifier."}

Hegemony is mostly used to refer to relationships between different nations (or countries). This might be direct dominance, such as through military might, but may be indirect dominance, such as when a nation can dictate the terms of trade to its advantage.\nHegemony often describes the relationship of a great power to nearby less powerful countries. The term is Greek, and was first used about the influence of a great city over the cities which were allied to it. Examples are the Peloponnesian League of Sparta (6th to 4th centuries BC); the short-lived Delian League of Classical Athens. The later League of Corinth was headed not by a state, but by Philip II of Macedon. Such a hegemon is a king or ruler with personal power.\nA hegemonic relationship is usually described as less than an empire, but more than a regional power. This means a hegemon may not actually take control of other nations, but has the power to greatly influence what they do. On the other hand, a global hegemon is more powerful than, say, Iran is in the Middle East."}
