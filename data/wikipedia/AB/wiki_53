Following the war, Hoyt served as the sixth Attorney General of Kansas.\nEarly life and John Brown's Trial.\nGeorge Henry Hoyt was born in Athol, Massachusetts, on November 25, 1837. He was the only surviving son of Athol physician and abolitionist George Hoyt and his wife Avelina Witt Hoyt. In 1851, the Hoyts moved to Boston, where George studied law. Lysander Spooner, abolitionist anarchist and good friend of Dr. Hoyt, strongly influenced young George's views of abolition, as did radical orator Wendell Phillips.\nLater life.\nHoyt died in Athol on February 2, 1877, aged 39."}

Anderson (1840\u00a0\u2013 October 26, 1864), also known as \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson, was one of the deadliest and most famous pro-Confederate guerrilla leaders in the American Civil War. Anderson led a group of volunteer rangers who attacked Union loyalists and federal soldiers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.\nEarly life.\nWilliam T. Anderson was born in 1840 in Hopkins County, Kentucky, to William C. and Martha Anderson. His siblings were Jim, Ellis, Mary Ellen, Josephine and Janie. His schoolmates remembered him as a well-behaved, quiet child. During his childhood, Anderson's family moved to Huntsville, Missouri, where his father got a job on a farm, and the family became well-respected. In 1857, they moved to the Kansas Territory, going southwest on the Santa Fe Trail and settling east of Council Grove.\nThe Anderson family supported slavery, though they did not own slaves. They moved to Kansas most likely for economic rather than political reasons."}

{"id": "759553", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=759553", "title": "Androphilia and gynephilia", "text": "Androphilia and gynephilia are terms in behavioral science (the study of human and animal behavior) that describe sexual orientation. It is an alternative to the gender binary in homosexual and heterosexual. Androphilia is attraction to a man or masculinity (any quality or behavior linked to a man). Gynephilia is attraction to a woman or femininity. Ambiphilia (bisexuality) is the combination of androphilia and gynephilia.\nThe terms describe the focus of attraction with no need to credit a sex assignment or gender identity to the person. It will skirt any difficulty to understand people between the West and the East. The terms will also describe intersex and transgender people.\nHistory.\nAndrophilia.\nMagnus Hirschfeld was an early 1900s German sexologist (expert in sex and sexuality). Hirschfeld put a homosexual man in one of four groups. A man with attraction to a boy (pedophile). A man with attraction to an adolescent boy (ephebophile). A man with attraction to another young man (androphile). A man with attraction to an old man (gerontophile).\n\"Androphilia, A Manifesto: Rejecting the Gay Identity, Reclaiming Masculinity\" is a book by Jack Donovan. Donovan uses \"androphilia\" to focus on masculinity in male homosexual desire. He also uses the term to reject the femininity and androgyny (combination of masculinity and femininity) in some parts of homosexual life.\n\"Androsexuality\" is the same as \"androphilia\".\nAlternative use in biology and medicine\n\"Androphilic\" the same as \"anthropophilic\" in biology\". Anthropophilic\" is a parasite who will desire a human more than an animal. \"Androphilic\" will also describe certain proteins and androgen receptors.\nGynephilia.\nIn Ancient Greek, there is a different form of the term. In \"Idyll\" 8, line 60, Theocritus uses \"gynaikophilias\" to describe the very strong desire Zeus has for any woman.\nSigmund Freud says \"gynecophilic\" to describe his case study (detailed study of one person) Dora. Freud also uses the term in writing.\n\"Gynesexuality\" is the same as \"gynephilia\". Psychoanalyst Nancy Chodorow says the short preoedipal (attraction to the mother and jealousy of the father) time of focus on the mother should be named \"gynesexuality\" or \"matrisexuality.\"\nAttraction.\n\"Androphilia\" and \"gynephilia\" separate group attraction based on how old a person is. John Money names this chronophilia. Attraction to an adult is teleiophilia or adultophilia. Here, \"androphilia\" and \"gynephilia\" mean \"attraction to an adult male\" and \"attraction to an adult female.\"\nAndrophilia and gynephilia scales.\nKurt Freund and Betty Steiner create the 9-item Gynephilia Scale and the 13-item Androphilia Scale in 1982. This measures attraction in a mature female or a mature male. In 1985, Ray Blanchard names a new one the Modified Androphilia-Gynephilia Index (MAGI).\nGender identity and behavior.\nMagnus Hirschfeld sorts between gynephilic, bisexual, androphilic, asexual, and automonosexual (sexual attraction to themselves only) transgender woman.\nSince the middle of the 1900s, some psychologists like to use \"homosexual transsexual\" (to mean the same as straight transgender woman) and \"heterosexual transsexual\" (to mean the same as transgender lesbian). Biologist Bruce Bagemihl is against this. It is because Bageminl thought it makes it simple to say a transsexual is a homosexual male looking to run from stigma. The term \"homosexual transsexual\" is \"heterosexist\" because it describes people by sex assignment and not gender identity. Sexologist John Bancroft says he regrets using this language. It was normal at the time Bancroft used it to talk about transgender women. Since 2008, he attempts to use terms that do not hurt the feelings of anyone. Sexologist Charles Allen Moser is also against any terms like that.\nSexologist Militon Diamond supports the terms androphilic, gynecophilic, and ambiphilic to describe any partner a person desires (andro = male, gyneco = female, ambi = both, philic = to love).\nGender in the East.\nSome scientists support use of the terms to skirt bias in concepts of human sexuality in the West. Johanna Schmidt says that in a society where a third gender is supported, a term like \"homosexual transsexual\" does not line up."}

We can also use other measures to make the effective reproduction rate (Re, usually written Rt with \"t\" for time) lower than the basic reproduction rate (R0).\nAn example of a vaccine that works really well is the smallpox vaccine, which stopped smallpox virus from spreading so well that it no longer exists except in laboratories.

It is also used as a metaphor for other extreme devotion to a person of thing.\nLiteral Meaning of Idolatry.\nIdolatry is the worship of an idol or image, being a picture, a statue, or a person in place of God. In Judaism, Christianity and Islam, idolatry means worshiping something that is not God. These religions teach that there is only one God. Idolatry is said to be the \"worship of false gods\". It is forbidden by religious rules such as the Ten Commandments. There it says, \"You shall not make a carved image (as a God)\" and \"You shall not have any other god ahead of Me (the only God). The monotheistic religions all have such rules.\nThe strict understanding of these rules would not allow religious statues of any kind. People who hold these views think that such statues should be destroyed. Others would say that worshipers must understand that the statue is only a symbol for God. They say that the image or statue is not the god. This has long been accompanied with violence between religious groups that forbid idol worship and those who have accepted icons, images and idols for worship. In many Indian religions, such as theistic and non-theistic forms of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, idols (\"murti\") are to be considered as symbolism for the absolute but not The Absolute. In the traditional religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, Africa, Asia, the Americas and elsewhere, the reverence of an image or statue has been a common practice. These statues or images have carried different meanings and significance.\nThe definition of idolatry has been a contested topic within Abrahamic religions, with many Muslims and Protestant Christians condemning the Catholic veneration of the Virgin Mary as a form of idolatry. This veneration of Mary and other Saints often involves statues. In the Orthodox churches, flat painted images are common, instead of carved statues. These are called Icons.\nIn history, many religions have accused others of idolatry. These accusations are that statues and images are devoid of symbolism. They say that many people believe the idol, statue or image is a god. Different groups often think that icons or statues in their religion have meaningful symbolism, but another person's religious images do not.\nIdolatry as a Metaphor.\nReligious leaders have used the idea of Idolatry (literal worship of statues or images) as a metaphor. They call anything that comes ahead of God an Idol. Saint Paul writes that \"covetousness\" (wanting material things) is idolatry. Jesus preached that \"you cannot serve God and Mammon\". Mammon was the Syrian God of riches. Muslim writers warn of making idols of material things or even political ideologies. Eastern religions have also warned about making material things one's god.\n\"Idolizing\" persons, such as rock stars can also be seen as a form of idolatry. The popular TV show \"American Idol\" seems to use the term in a positive way. But this has been questioned even by non religious persons. Billy Graham has warned against various things that become idols in a person's life."}

Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, Hal Lando and George Carlin return to their roles from the first movie. It also stars William Sadler as Death. It received mixed reviews. \nA sequel, \"Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music\" is scheduled to be released in August 2020.\nCast.\nProgressive rock/metal band Primus appear as themselves during Battle of the Bands, performing \"Tommy the Cat\". Musician Jim Martin, at the time the lead guitarist of Faith No More, also appears as himself, introduced by Rufus as \"Sir James Martin, head of the Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center.\" Candace and Lauren Mead portray \"Little Bill\" Logan and \"Little Ted\" Preston; with the characters revealed in \"Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music\" to be girls, whose full names are shown to be Billie Logan and Thea Preston.\nSadler had been drawn to the role of Death as at the time, he had been cast as a serious villain in numerous films, but had wanted to return to doing comedy as he had done earlier in the Broadway production of \"Biloxi Blues\". Having enjoyed \"Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure\", he thought the idea of Death as a villain in a comedic film would be a good role for him, auditioning via tape using an accent from Czechoslovakian actor Jan T\u0159\u00edska with whom he had co-performed in an earlier stage production. When he was called in to audition in person, they had asked him to come in aged makeup; Sadler contacted Scott Eddo, the makeup supervisor for \"Die Hard 2\" to make him look authentically old, which Sadler believed helped get him the role, along with the humor he injected into the audition. Sadler said that in the film, nearly everything Death does was written into the script, outside of the same accent that he used from his audition forward.\nThe name \"Station\" was the result of a leftover editing typo, according to the movie's writers Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon. They had cut a scene from the script, labeled \"INT. POLICE STATION\" but had left the \"STATION\" part dangling, and as they were drunk at the time, found that saying \"Station\" in a \"[tiny] Martian voice\" was hilarious, and the name stuck."}

Some mammals in the Bangweulu Wetlands are buffalo, zebra, elephants, hippopotamus, hyenas, jackals, lechwe, sable antelope, and sitatunga. Millions of straw-coloured fruit bats go to Bangweulu's Mushitu swamp forest, in Kasanka National Park. In 2016, African Parks partnered with Fondation Segr\u00e9 to help 600 animals, including hartebeest, impala, and puku, into the wetlands.\nBangweulu has been called a \"Important Bird Area\" by BirdLife International. The wetlands are home to more than 400 bird species, including cormorants, ducks, egrets, Geese, herons, ibises, pygmy goose, and waders. Other animals found in Bangweulu include the great white pelican, saddle-billed stork, spoonbill, and wattled crane.\nHuman\u2013wildlife conflict.\nBangweulu holds several villages, and around 50,000\u201390,000 people depend on the wetlands, resulting in human\u2013wildlife conflict. The ecosystem could be damaged by habitat burning for farming, overfishing, and poaching. 75 poachers were arrested in 2010, and 115 were arrested in 2011.

There's a function to calculate the error. This function should be given the unknown value, but instead can only be given the interval. The result is a function which will map intervals.\nInterval arithmetic can be used to treat rounding errors, or to treat insecurities with measurements: Each measurement has a certain error, which cannot be determined exactly.\nDefinition.\nFor real intervals (interval of real numbers), interval arithmetic is defined as follows:\nApplications.\nInterval arithmetic is mainly used in the field of validated numerics. It is also used in other technical areas.\nImplementations.\nSince the birth of interval arithmetic, many experts have made interval arithmetic programs. The most famous works are INTLAB (made with MATLAB), arb, JuliaIntervals, and kv.\nCommunity.\nThere are several international conferences about interval arithmetic.

Phil Barber, (Johnny Whitaker), a wealthy man, recently sold his computer company to spend more time with his son Chris (Justin Cone), a model, who does not care about this decision. At the same time, Susan (Kristine DeBell) is finding it hard to make enough money as a caterer with her two children Tina (Janis Peebles) and Trent (Daniel Dannas). Duffy then enters the families' lives, talking to them to give them advice, but can only talk to each person once.\nProduction.\nThe film is one of several direct-to-video family films directed by David DeCoteau using the false name Mary Crawford.

Club\" gave a mostly negative review for the film, but said \"for lovers of utter, unredeemable trash, it is highly recommended.\" CraveOnline also gave a negative review, but said the film should be for \"Bad Movie Night\".\nIn an interview, DeCoteau, talking about the film, said \"people have called me who I haven't seen since high school who said, 'David, after 100 movies you've finally made a movie we like.'\" He added, \"I watched it again, because I hadn't seen it since we made it, and it is so ridiculous and hilarious and over-the-top.\""}

They are also many libraries based on the finite element method such as:\nScientific Background.\nMotivation of this area.\nMany PDEs appeared for the study of physics and other areas in science. Therefore, many mathematicians have challenged to make methods to solve them, but there is no method to mathematically solve PDEs except the Hirota direct method and the inverse scattering method. This is why numerical methods for PDEs are needed.\nThe Finite Difference Method (FDM) and its problems.\nOne of the most basic PDE solver is the finite difference method (FDM). This method approximates derivatives as differences:\nThis method works for easy problems. But it is powerless to some equations (such as the Navier\u2013Stokes equations) because they are non-linear. Since this difficulty appeared, numerical analysts started to study other methods (just like the finite element method, FEM). On the other hand, some experts started to consider improvements for FDM.\nEvolution of the FDM.\nExperts have discovered difference methods which preserves the property of the given PDE.\nIntegrable Difference Schemes.\nRyogo Hirota, Mark Ablowitz and others have made methods that preserves the integrability (important mathematical property in the theory of dynamical systems) of PDEs. These methods are known to have better accuaracy than the original FDM.\nStructure Preserving Numerical Methods.\nMany PDEs have appeared from physics. So we can think about difference methods preserving physical properties. These difference methods are known as structure preserving numerical methods. The following list is the examples of them:\nSome experts are studying their relation between numerical linear algebra.\nOthers.\nThe difference mthods in above have high accuracy, but their usage is limited because they depend on the behaviour of the given PDEs. This is why new types of FDM are still studied. For example, the following methods are studied:\nValidated Numerics for PDEs.\nNot only approximate solvers, but the study to \"verify the existence of solution by computers\" is also active. This study is needed because numerically obtained solutions could be phantom solutions (fake solutions). This kind of incident is already reported.\nFurther Reading.\nLiteratures for specific solvers are described as follows."}

His music is a creative synthesis of contemporary jazz and Armenian folk music. His arrangements are a jazzy exploration of the world of oriental melodies and western harmonies. The recent album \u201cNoor\u201d with Karen Asatrian &amp; Armenian Spirit band is an expression of Armenian traditional songs rearranged with a contemporary jazz style.\nEarly life.\nKaren Asatrian received his first education in classical Violin and Piano at the Tchaikovsky Music School in Yerevan. He then continued his studies of both instruments as well as in composition at the Komitas State Conservatory of Yerevan. In 1999, he moved to Carinthia, Austria, where he finalized his Jazz-Piano studies under the direction of Dr. Prof. Harry Neuwirth, with distinction. In 2001, Karen successfully graduated earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Instrumental (Vocal) Pedagogy Studies receiving the state teaching certification for jazzpiano.\nCareer.\nSignificant highlights throughout the musical career of Karen Asatrian have been the initiation of the \"Brahms Project\" (Jazz-Trio with Chamber Orchestra) and the presentation of his original compositions with the Norbert Artner Chamber Choir. His success was marked through collaborations with The Bruckner Symphony Orchestra, Samul-Nori (Korean percussion Ensembles), Dee Dee Bridgewater, George Garzone, Jamaaladeen Tacuma, a.m.m.. Performances within the \u201cThree Nights of Jazz\u201d- Festivals in Saalfelden (Austria), Jazz Festivals Wiesn in Vienna, Sziget Festivals in Budapest. Rearrangement and performance of J.

In 2007, Asatrian received the Armenian Music Award in the category of Best Jazz Album for his CD \"Pathway\". Asatrian demonstrates his attachment to his roots and his passion for the Armenian musical tradition through his AvantgardeFolk-Jazz Group \"Karen Asatrian &amp; Armenian Spirit\" that he founded in 2013.\nIn the spirit of western musical tradition, built on early Christian liturgy, Karen Asatrian composed the \"Prayer Wheel\" - a mass for Choir, Vocalist and Jazz-Ensemble. The brilliant and much-noticed premiere of the 80-minute-composition at the Concert Hall of Carinthia in January 2015 was followed by further performances throughout Austria. This success was marked by the performance of Prayer Wheel within the Salzburg Festival 2016 in cooperation with the Philharmonia Choir Vienna. The latter has been recorded and released in 2017 as a CD by Skylark Production and is being distributed by Universal Music Austria. In addition to his artistic activities and performances, Karen Asatrian is a respected Jazz Piano-Professor at the Carinthian State Conservatory as well as at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna."}

The film was produced by Twentieth Century Fox, and filmed entirely in North Wales and England. Many things in the film were not true to the life of Gladys. However, it brought her some fame. This allowed her to speak to groups in many countries about her true work and love for Jesus.\nMissionary service.\nGladys was not accepted by missionary societies due to her lack of education. She saved money for the train fare. She went to China on her own to work with an older woman. After that woman, Jeannie Lawson, died, Gladys took over her work. Much of her life was spent caring for orphans. During the Second World War, she rescued many orphans who had been abandoned or whose parents had been killed. This involved dangerous journeys with the children to get away from places where the war was raging. She finally settled in Taiwan in 1958. There, she founded the Gladys Aylward Orphanage, where she worked until her death in 1970."}

The event is historically significant as one of the events that led to the French populace's disillusionment with the monarchy and led to the French Revolution.\nThe necklace.\nIn 1772, Louis XV of France decided to make Madame du Barry, with whom he was in love with, a special gift at the cost of 2,000,000 livres (about $15.1 million in 2020 USD). He wanted Parisian jewelers Charles Auguste Boehmer and Paul Bassange to create a diamond necklace that would be the greatest necklace ever made.\nEvent.\nA trickster who called herself Jeanne de Valois-Saint-R\u00e9my, also known as Jeanne de la Motte, created a plan to use the necklace to get rich and possibly power and royal honors. In March 1785, Jeanne became the mistress of the Cardinal de Rohan, a former French ambassador to the court of Vienna. \nThe Cardinal was hated by Queen Marie Antoinette for having spread rumors about the Queen's behavior to her mother, the Holy Roman empress Maria Theresa. The Queen had also learned of a letter in which the Cardinal spoke of Maria Theresa in a manner that the Queen found offensive.\nAt this time, the Cardinal was trying to get the Queen's to like him again so that he could become Prime Minister of France. Jeanne de la Motte persuaded Rohan that she had been friends with the Queen. After hearing this, Rohan used Jeanne to get the Queen to like him again (though he did not know that Jeanne was lying to him). Jeanne promised the Cardinal that she will get the Queen to like him.\nThe affair began after Jeanned continued to send fake letters to the Cardinal pretending to be Marie Antoinette. After Rohan fell in love with Antoinette as he believed she was falling in love with him, he wanted to meet her. In the gardens of the Palace of Versailles, the Cardinal met with a woman he believed to be Marie Antoinette. In fact, the woman was a prostitute, Nicole Le Guay d'Oliva, whom Jeanne had hired because of her resemblance to the Queen. \nJeanne took advantage of lying to Rohan by asking a lot of money. \nOn 21 January 1785, Jeanne told the Cardinal that Marie Antoinette wanted to buy the necklace; but, not wishing to purchase such an expensive item publicly during a time of need, the Queen wanted the Cardinal to act as a secret buyer. A little while later, Rohan negotiated the purchase of the necklace for 2,000,000 livres. Rohan took the necklace to Jeanne's house, where a man, whom Rohan believed to be a valet of the Queen, came to fetch it. The diamond necklace \u201cwas picked apart, and the gems sold on the black markets of Paris and London\u201d by Madame de la Motte.\nAftermath.\nWhen Marie Antoinette found out about this, she had Rohan arrested publicly. When this happened, Jeanne had left the town but was arrested afterwards. \nCardinal Rohan and Jeanne de la Motte were found guilty. Rohan was sentenced to strip his honors and ambassador jobs and in exile. Jeanne was sentenced to be whipped, branded and in jail. However, she escaped jail and took refuge in London.\nIn popular culture.\nMany books and other works have shown the Affair of the Diamond Necklace:"}

It is about the events aboard United Airlines Flight 93, which was hijacked during the September 11 attacks. \nThe movie was made with the help of many of the passengers' families, though not all agreed to participate. \nPlot.\nIn a hotel room in Newark, New Jersey at dawn where Ziad Jarrah is seen reading and praying with a Quran. His roommate, Ahmed al-Haznawi tells him the time has come to begin their attack. The latter is then seen shaving. In another hotel in Newark Saeed al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Nami are seen praying. The four men then leave their respective hotels and meet each other at Newark Liberty International Airport. They all successfully get past security and wait at a gate with other passengers to board Flight 93, bound for San Francisco. Nami and Ghamdi enter the plane first, followed by al-Haznawi and finally Jarrah, who makes a final phone call to his girlfriend. The plane is delayed due to heavy traffic but eventually takes off. At this time Flight 11 has been hijacked by Mohamed Atta and his fellow hijackers. Atta accidentally informs the air traffic controllers about this.\nAir traffic controllers monitoring all current flights determine that American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 from Boston's Logan International Airport has taken a turn toward New York City. Shortly after, Flight 11 crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, although the air traffic controllers do not immediately realize what has happened. About 20 minutes earlier, a tape recording was made of Mohamed Atta's line \"We have some planes, just stay quiet and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.\"\nMeanwhile, United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, also from Boston, is also hijacked and begins to descend and turn toward New York City as well. Air traffic controllers then realize they are dealing with multiple hijackings. American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 is also hijacked. The air traffic controllers and Air Force watch as Flight 175 crashes into the South Tower of the World Trade Center on live television, as reported by CNN.\nMeanwhile, on Flight 93, the passengers are served their breakfast an impatient Ahmed al-Nami demands to know from Jarrah why they are not yet hijacking. Jarrah insists the time is not right and orders him to go back to his seat. Soon after, al-Haznawi enters a toilet, where he prepares an artificial bomb. After he returns to his seat, al-Ghamdi makes the first move by grabbing head flight attendant Debbie Welsh, and al-Haznawi shows the \"bomb\", causing mass panic among the passengers. Both al-Ghamdi and al-Nami attack some of the passengers, forcing the others to retreat to the back of the plane. Jarrah then orders Debbie to let them into the cockpit. At this point co-pilot, Lee Homer is attacked and Jarrah takes over the controls while captain Jason Dahl is attacked.\nFlight 93 turns towards D.C. while FAA National Operations Manager Ben Sliney decides to shut down all airspace in the United States and ground every flight. By this time, Flight 77 has crashed into the Pentagon.\nThe passengers and crew make calls to their families and tell them their plane is hijacked. After learning both the World Trade Center and Pentagon were destroyed by three other planes, as well as seeing the bodies of Debbie Welsh and the pilots, the passengers believe that their plane will also crash, and decide to retake the plane, with a passenger claiming he has had experience flying planes. The passengers and crew make weapons of anything they come across and wait for the perfect moment to save the plane. They soon overpower al-Haznawi and despite his efforts to keep them at bay al-Nami is soon also killed by strangulation. Using a food cart, the male passengers break down the cockpit door, but knowing their intentions, Jarrah puts the plane into a nosedive, accepting that his bid to destroy the Capitol has failed. The passengers frantically try to gain control of the aircraft but the plane is turned upside down, creating strong G-forces, and as the passengers try to reach the yoke, the aircraft crashes, killing all those on board.\nThe roles of one of the flight attendants, the two pilots, and many other airline personnel were filled by actual airline employees. \nProduction.\nDuring production, the actors playing the crew and the passengers of the flight were put in separate hotels from the actors portraying the hijackers, even eating their meals separately, ostensibly to create an air of antagonism in the film between the two groups. The set itself was built so that it moved the way the actual flight did. During the filming, many of the actors actually got hurt, and the blood visible on their faces during the revolting scene is authentic and not fake.\nAdams saying that the memory of her husband's death was still too raw. \"Sunday Times\" critic Cosmo Landesman mused, \"Surely one of the passengers didn't phone home to point out that there was a cowardly German on board who wanted to give in?\" Critic John Harris suggested in a \"Guardian\" blog, \"there will surely be all kinds of cries about old European surrender monkeys, the United States' contrasting backbone etc.\"\nRelease.\n\"United 93\" premiered on April 26, 2006, at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. Several family members of the passengers aboard the flight attended the premiere to show their support.\nThe movie opened in North America on April 28, 2006, to strong positive reviews. The total money made from \"United 93\" was $31.4 million in the United States, and $76.3 million worldwide. \nThe movie also received two Academy Award nominations, including Best Director for Greengrass."}

He was also influenced by Hindu and Sikh holy men. At age 14 his mother died and he rebelled against religion. He wanted to kill himself, but prayed that God would come and stop him. That night, he believed that Jesus appeared to him. He decided to become a Christian missionary. His family opposed this, but at age 16 he was baptized. \nMissionary travels.\nTaking the title Sadhu, Sundar began to travel within India and Kashmir. He also went to Afganistan and Tibet. He believed that western influences had corrupted Christian belief and practice. He studied at an Anglican college for a short time. Then he left because the priest tried to get him to dress like a European and adopt other British customs. His travels are believed to have resulted in many conversions. He kept no records so exact information is not available. It is also told that he did miracles through the power of Jesus. \nLater Sundar Singh traveled in many countries including Europe and North America. He was made sad by the materialism of those countries, and returned to India to continue his work. While on a final trip to Tibet, he is assumed to have died, but no details are known."}

He obtained his Ph.D. in history at the University of Sorbonne in Paris, France, in 1989. He has held appointments at Columbia University in New York, Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., University of Pennsylvania, University of California, Berkeley, Yale University, Duke University and Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) in Dakar, Senegal. He was assistant professor of history at Columbia University, New York, from 1988\u20131991, a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1991 to 1992, associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania from 1992 to 1996, executive director of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (Codesria) in Dakar, Senegal, from 1996 to 2000. Achille was also a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2001, and a visiting professor at Yale University in 2003. He was a research professor in history and politics at Harvard University's W. E. B. Du Bois Research Institute.\nHe has written extensively in African history and politics, including \"La naissance du maquis dans le Sud-Cameroun\" (Paris: Karthala, 1996). \"On the Postcolony\" was published in Paris in 2000 in French and the English translation was published by the University of California Press, Berkeley, in 2001. In 2015, Wits University Press published a new, African edition. He has an A1 rating from the National Research Foundation.\nCurrent appointments.\nMbembe is currently a member of the staff at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research (WISER) at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and also has an annual visiting appointment at the Franklin Humanities Institute at Duke University.\nHe is a contributing editor to the scholarly journal \"Public Culture\".\nWork.\nHis main research topics are African history, Postcolonial Studies and politics and social science.\nMbembe\u2019s most important works are: \"Les jeunes et l\u2019ordre politique en Afrique noire\" (1985); \"La naissance du maquis dans le Sud-Cameroun (1920\u20131960)\"; \"Histoire des usages de la raison en colonie\" (1996); \"De la postcolonie.

He argues that the colonial powers dictated how some people may live and how some must die. He uses the examples of Palestine and South Africa to show how the power of sovereignty now serves the creation of zones of death where death becomes the ultimate exercise of domination and the primary form of resistance.\nPrivate life.\nAchille Mbembe is married to Sarah Nuttall, who is Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies and Director of the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. They have written several texts together and have two children."}

But difficulty remains even discussion is limited to matrices (which is a finite dimension mathematical operator). This is because difficulty comes not only from infinite dimension but also non-commutativity.

The back of the work contains some accidental scribbles in black and red chalk (an upward motif seems to represent architectural forms), which do not seem to be the artist's.

This happens when there are too many sea urchins. The fish, krill and other animals that live in the kelp either die or leave. Urchin barrens occur in coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean.\nUrchin barrens had been forming for a long time, but in the second half of the 2010s, there were suddenly many more.\nCauses.\nPeople first noticed urchin barrens in the 1800s when the sea otters were hunted for their fur. People killed so many sea otters that they almost went extinct. Sea otters like to eat sea urchins, so without sea otters to eat them, there were many, many sea urchins.\nWarm ocean currents also affect sea urchin populations. In some places, kelp forests turn into urchin barrens and then grow back depending on the currents that year.\nStarfish also eat sea urchins. The sunflower starfish is the only animal that regularly eats the purple sea urchin. Even sea otters like red sea urchins more than they like purple sea urchins. When a disease in 2013 killed most of the starfish on the Pacific coast, there were many more purple sea urchins left. One study showed that the number of purple sea urchins in one reef off the coast of Oregon increased 10,000% in the five years between 2014 and 2019. They either ate or crowded out the red abalone and red sea urchins that humans like to eat. The abalone fishery in California closed in 2018, a loss of US$44 million per year.\nWhen purple sea urchins run out of food, they try to eat each other, and then they become dormant, as if sleeping. They do not try to reproduce, so their gonads shrink. Because the gonads are the part of the urchin that humans like to eat, dormant purple sea urchins cannot be caught and sold for food.\nClimate change.\nScientists said the warmer water in the early 2010s weakened the bull kelp. In 2016, a mass of warm water nicknamed the \"Blob\" kept the coast of California very warm. The warm water also made it easier for the sea urchins to reproduce, so they had many more young than usual.\nA study showed that 90% of the bull kelp off the coast of California had been killed in the late 2010s.\nRestoration.\nScientists performed tank and ocean experiments on other animals, such as lobsters, to see if they would eat enough purple sea urchins to help the kelp forests grow back, but they only helped a little.\nIn places where sea otters have returned, like Juan de Fuca Strait, they ate enough sea urchins that the kelp forests grew back.\nSome companies hired red abalone divers to collect purple sea urchins and bring them to controlled sea ranches where they could be fed until they were healthy enough to sell for human use."}

She had just finished practising on an ice rink in the arena. Shane Stant did the attack with his uncle Derrick Smith. Smith was the getaway driver. They were both paid by Jeff Gillooly and Shawn Eckardt to injure Kerrigan so that she could not take part in the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating championships and 1994 Winter Olympics. Jeff Gillooly was the ex-husband of Nancy Kerrigan's rival in figure skating at the time, Tonya Harding. Some people think Harding was also involved in the attack. Gillooly and Eckdardt both said that Tonya Harding knew about the attack, but Harding said that she didn't know about it.\nKerrigan could not take part in the rest of the U.S. Championships because of the attack. She healed in time to take part in the Winter Olympics and got a silver medal. Harding took part in both the U.S. Championships and the Winter Olympics. Tonya Harding was banned for life from USFSA figure skating events. Harding had won the U.S. Championships, but had this taken away from her afterwards.\nBackground.\nNancy Kerrigan is an American former figure skater. In January 1994, she was about to take part in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit. Her main rival in that tournament was Tonya Harding. The attack happened a few days before the tournament. It caused to Kerrigan to not be able to take part. The Winter Olympics were also going to take place in February. Kerrigan and Harding were the two female figure skaters from the United States in the Olympics. The attack helped Harding as it made it easier for her to win the U.S. Championships.

They became known as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, but some researchers say that their ethnic roots can be traced to Central Asia. During their westward migration across the Eurasian steppe, the Bulgar tribes absorbed other ethnic groups and cultural influences in a process of ethnogenesis, including Indo-European, Finno-Ugric and Hunnic tribes. Modern genetic research on Central Asian Turkic people and ethnic groups related to the Bulgars points to an affiliation with Western Eurasian populations. The Bulgars spoke a Turkic language, i.e. Bulgar language of Oghuric branch. They preserved the military titles, organization and customs of Eurasian steppes, as well as pagan shamanism and belief in the sky deity Tangra."}

The murder started the George Floyd protests against racism in the United States and in other countries.\nGeorge Floyd was a 46 year old African-American man from Houston, Texas. Chauvin, a police officer of the Minneapolis Police Department, killed Floyd while he was under arrest for using counterfeit cash. Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd was gasping for breath. Witnesses said Floyd told the officers, \"I can't breathe\" many times before he lost consciousness. This happened in the Powderhorn area of Minneapolis. \nThe event was recorded on many mobile phones. Four officers involved were fired the next day. The Federal Bureau of Investigation announced a federal civil rights investigation into the incident.\nIn late May, after days of protests, the officer who killed Floyd, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charge was later changed to second-degree murder. The three other officers were charged on June 3 with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, meaning they are charged with helping Chauvin kill Floyd.\nChauvin's trial began on March 9, 2021. On April 20, 2021, a jury found Chauvin guilty. On June 25, Chauvin was given a sentence of 22 years and six months in prison.\nPeople involved.\nGeorge Floyd.\nGeorge Floyd was a 46-year-old African-American man from Houston, Texas. He was a rapper who worked with the Houston-based hip hop group Screwed Up Click and freestyled under the alias \"Big Floyd\" on mixtapes released by DJ Screw. In 2009, Floyd was sentenced to five years in prison for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Floyd moved to Minnesota around 2014. At the time of his death, Floyd had recently lost his job due to Minnesota's stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic. Floyd was the father of two daughters, aged 6 and 22.\nEvent.\nShortly after 8:00 p.m. on May 25, Memorial Day, Minneapolis Police Department officers responded to a \"forgery in progress\" on Chicago Avenue South in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis. Floyd \"tried to use forged documents at a nearby deli.\" According to a co-owner of Cup Foods, Floyd attempted to use a $20 bill that a staff member identified as counterfeit. According to police, Floyd was in a nearby car and \"appeared to be drunk.\"\nAccording to the Minneapolis police, officers \"were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress,\" and called for an ambulance. No weapons were used in the arrest, according to a statement from the Minneapolis police.\nAccording to the Minneapolis Fire Department, paramedics moved Floyd from the location and were doing CPR and other lifesaving measures on an \"unresponsive, pulseless male.\" Floyd was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.\nFloyd was buried in Houston, Texas on June 9.\nAutopsies.\nGeorge Floyd's body was examined more than once, and the experts said different things about how he died.\nOn June 1, the Hennepin County medical examiner released a report. This report said that Floyd died because of homicide, which means killing, but does not mean that anybody is guilty of murder. The report also said that Floyd had recently used methamphetamine and had fentanyl intoxication. Prosecutors said that the Hennepin County medical examiner did not think Floyd died from lack of air. Prosecutors said they thought Floyd must have had heart disease or taken alcohol or drugs and that the police officers' actions would not have been enough to kill him by themselves. On June 3, they said Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19 in April, but they did not say this helped cause his death.\nGeorge Floyd's family hired Dr. Allecia M. Wilson of the University of Michigan and Dr. Michael Baden, who used to be a medical examiner for New York City, to examine Floyd's body and figure out how he died. They said that Floyd died from lack of air because the heavy weight of the officers on his back kept him from breathing, in addition to the knee on his neck. Dr. Baden said, \"The autopsy shows that Mr. Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. This is confirmed by information provided to Dr. Wilson and myself by the family.\" They also called his death a homicide.\nTrials.\nOn May 29, 2020, Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. On June 3, Chauvin was also charged with second-degree murder, a more serious crime. Chauvin was scheduled for arraignment, to appear in court, on June 8. In October, a judge took away the third-degree murder charge. In March 2021, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder again. \nJ. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting (helping) second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Kueng, Lane, and Thao each paid bail money and were released from jail by July. To be released on bail means that the suspect gives some money or a deed to property to the court and promises not to run away. If the suspect appears at the trial, the money or deed is returned. If the suspect runs away, the court keeps it. Lane was released on June 10, Kueng on June 19, and Thao on July 4. \nAt a pre-trial hearing during the last week in June, Minneapolis Judge Peter Cahill told lawyers and other officials to stop making public statements about the trial. He said if they did not stop, he would order the trial to take place somewhere other than Minneapolis. He also said, if they continued talking, he would issue a gag order, meaning they could be punished if they continued talking.\nIn January 2021, Judge Cahill decided that there would be two trials. The trial for Derek Chauvin would begin on March 8, 2021. The trial for Kueng, Lane, and Thao would begin on August 23, 2021.\nChauvin's trial began on March 8, 2021. On March 9, the judge and attorneys began to select the jury. Six of the jurors were white, four were black, and two were multiracial. The oldest juror was in her sixties. The trial was broadcasted on video. The court did not show pictures of the jury, but did broadcast their voices when talking.\nOn April 20, 2021, a jury found Chauvin guilty of three crimes: second-degree unintentional murder of someone while committing a big crime, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. The jurors had talked to each other for ten hours in two pieces, on Monday and Tuesday. The judge is scheduled to give him his sentence eight weeks later. The largest penalty the judge could give Chauvin is 40 years in prison but most people who commit these crimes spend 10-15 years in prison. That means the jury decided that Chauvin might not have meant to kill Floyd but did mean to assault him and that Chauvin knew that he was doing something dangerous that could kill Floyd.\nOn Friday, June 25, Judge Petera A. Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22.5 years in prison.\nChauvin tax trial.\nOn July 22, 2020, Derek Chauvin and his wife, Kellie Chauvin, were charged with several different kinds of tax evasion. They had not paid the correct sales tax or income tax for six years. Kellie Chauvin began the divorce process in May 2020, but legally she is still responsible for tax evasion during her marriage.\nAftermath.\nBeginning on May 26 and 27, there were protests near the place where Floyd died. The protests started out peacefully, but some parts became violent later, with people attacking a police precinct and local businesses. The protests on May 28 included looting and property set on fire. On May 28, hundreds of people marched to the center of Minneapolis holding signs saying \"I can't breathe\" and \"Fuck Donald Trump.\" The city of Minneapolis instituted an 8:00 p.m. curfew, meaning no one was meant to be on the street after that time.\nThere were sister protests in Oakland, New York, Chicago, Denver, and other parts of the United States. Over 500 people were arrested at one sister protest in Los Angeles. Parts of the Los Angeles protest were peaceful and parts were violent.\nThere were also protests outside the United States, in London, Toronto, Berlin and other places. Some of these international protesters said they wanted to support George Floyd but also notice the racist actions by police in their own countries.\nOn the morning of May 28, white Minneapolis police officers arrested Omar Jimenez, a reporter for CNN, and his crew while they were filming the protests. Jiminez is black. Jiminez told the officers that he and his crew were journalists and offered to move further away, but the officers arrested them anyway. They were released later that day. The governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, apologized to CNN, and said publicly that Jiminez and his crew had only been doing their jobs and acting within their rights. A white CNN reporter who had been working a block away from Jiminez noted that he had not been bothered by the police, only asked who he was.\nProtests continued into Friday, May 29, with protesters approaching the White House in Washington, D.C. and pulling away temporary fences. Some of the protesters threw bricks at the officers, which included United States Secret Service and United States Park Police.\nDuring the protests, people donated large amounts of money to black-led political groups, especially bail funds.\nIn June, George Floyd's brother, Philonese Floyd, asked the United Nations Human Rights Commission to make a team to study the killing of black people by the American police.\nReaction from Governor Tim Walz.\nOn Thursday May 28, Governor Tim Walz called for change: \"It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect. George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction.\"\nAfter the arrest of CNN reporter Omar Jiminez, Walz apologized to CNN, saying \"I take full responsibility.\"\nWalz also told the National Guard to be ready to come to the twin cities if they were needed and put the city under an 8:00 p.m. curfew. He said he thought the worst looters were probably outsiders who came from the city to hide in the crowds and cause problems.\nReaction from President Donald Trump.\nPresident Donald Trump said on Twitter that he had asked the FBI do an investigation, adding, \"My heart goes out to George's family and friends. Justice will be served!\" Trump also called Floyd's death as \"Sad and Tragic.\"\nLater, President Donald Trump called the protesters of the killing \"thugs\" and said \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter hid the post because it broke their rules about presenting violence as good. On May 30, Trump complimented the Secret Service agents who had kept the protesters away from the White House, saying the Service had \"vicious dogs and the most ominous weapons.\" He also posted on Twitter suggesting that his supporters stage a counter-protest: \"Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???\" \"MAGA\" is an acronym for the Trump slogan \"Make America Great Again.\"\nReaction from President Joe Biden.\nJoe Biden was not president in 2020 when Floyd was killed but he was president in 2021 during the trial of Derek Chauvin. In April 2021, he said the guilty verdict was a \"giant step forward in the march toward justice in America,\" but \"much too rare.\" Before he became President, Biden had promised to make a police commission for the whole country during his first 100 days as president, but he had not done so as of April 2021.\nOther politicians' reactions.\nWashington D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowswer would write, also on Twitter: \"While [Trump] hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd &amp; hundreds of years of institutional racism,\" she wrote. \"There are no vicious dogs &amp; ominous weapons. There is just a scared man.\"\nFormer Florida congressman Carlos Cubelo, a Republican, said, \"The president seems more out-of-touch and detached from the difficult reality the country is living than ever before.\"\nMinneapolis police department civil rights investigation.\nOn June 2, after days of protests, Governor Walz announced the Minnesota Department of Human Rights would investigate the Minneapolis police department to see if the police in general were mistreating people of color. The Minneapolis City Council agreed, saying, \"We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners.\"\nCity of Minneapolis.\nOn June 5, Minneapolis announced a new rule saying the police were not allowed to use chokeholds on people. \nState of Minnesota.\nThe Minnesota state legislature attempted to write a new law that would redesign all police departments, but the Democrats wanted large changes to policing and the Republicans wanted small changes, and they could not agree in time for any new bill to become law."}

In April, he got COVID-19 but got better.\nFloyd had 5 children and 2 grandchildren. His youngest daughter, Gianna, lives in Houston with his former partner. A GoFundMe campaign to help pay for Floyd's funeral costs and benefit his family made the site's record for the most individual donations.\nDeath.\nOn May 25, 2020, a 44 year old white police officer named Derek Chauvin killed Floyd in Minneapolis by putting him in a chokehold during an arrest on suspicion of forgery when an employee from Cup Foods informed the Minneapolis Police Department that he had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes and that he was believed to be awfully drunk and not in control of himself. Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck, which meant that he could not breathe. Witnesses said that Floyd was reported to plead \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d multiple times to the officers. Floyd could not move because he was handcuffed and lying face down. Two other officers named Thomas Lane and James Alexander Keung were on Floyd's back and legs and another officer named Tou Thao stopped others from helping Floyd.For the last three of those minutes, Floyd did not move and had no pulse but officers did not try to revive him. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck as paramedics attempted to treat him.According to The New York Times, Chauvin had restrained Floyd for eight minutes and forty six seconds.\nThe second autopsy report done by the county said that Floyd's death was a homicide caused by cardiac arrest caused by him being restrained. This autopsy was done after people complained about the first one, which did not say homicide was the cause of his death.\nHis family had an autopsy done by another doctor, which said that Floyd died of asphyxia. However, it was done without samples from his body.\nSome people nearby filmed the officers hurting Floyd and then put the videos on the Internet. Because of this, people started to protest. Protests began in Minneapolis the day after Floyd died. More protests would be held in all 50 US states and in 400 cities all around the world.\nBurial.\nOn June 4, 2020, a memorial service for Floyd took place in Minneapolis with Al Sharpton delivering the eulogy.\nServices were planned in North Carolina with a public viewing and private service on June 6 and in Houston on June 8 and 9.\nFloyd is buried next to his mother in Pearland, Texas.\nLegacy.\nA legacy is an impact that someone leaves behind when they die. George Floyd left behind a big legacy because he died due to police violence. In the United States, the police have a history of racism and not treating minority groups right. After Floyd died, there were big efforts to stop racism everywhere in the country, not just against Black people.\nProtests.\nMany people were sad and angry about George Floyd's death. They think it is proof that racism is still a big problem in the United States. Some people came out to the streets to protests. Many protests were peaceful. Others were violent.\nSchools.\nSome universities created scholarships in George Floyd's name. The CEO of Netflix and his wife made a $120 million donation to several historically black colleges and universities. These schools were created by and for African Americans as they were usually not allowed to attend colleges in the past.\nLaw.\nA bill proposed by US Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (a Democrat from Texas), the George Floyd Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, was made to reduce police brutality and establish national policing standards.\n8'46\".\nThe length of time that Chauvin was believed to have had his knee on Floyd's neck, eight minutes forty-six seconds, was used as a \"moment of silence\" to honor Floyd.\nArt.\nMany artists around the world created murals to honor George Floyd.\nMedia.\nGeorge Floyd's death was the cover story for The Economist. It wrote that his legacy was \"the rich promise of social change.\"\nHip Hop.\nHouston rappers have posted tributes to Floyd and called for justice in what they see as an act of police brutality against an African-American man. \u201cR.I.P. Big Floyd He took his life in broad day may God bring his family justice,\u201d original Screwed Up Click member Lil\u2019 Keke wrote on Instagram. His post asked followers to call Minneapolis District Attorney Michael Freeman and demand charges be pressed against the four officers fired after detaining Floyd for an alleged forgery in progress, one of whom pushed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck, according to a bystander video. \u201cSay His Name #GeorgeFloyd Rest Easy\u2026 The Fight For Us Begins Now,\u201d rapper Trae The Truth, another member of Screwed Up Click, wrote alongside a photo of Floyd. \u201c4 Officers Fired Aint Enough!!!\u201d he added on a subsequent post. Minneapolis residents protested Floyd\u2019s death and the lack of charges for the officers on May 26, and were met with more police force."}

So Violet will go to school with sushi and a Greek salad, for example...If a mother wants to feed her child cherry tomatoes over cheezels \"(sic)\" then she can. It\u2019s not deprivation or a screwed up childhood... it\u2019s because she cares, and perhaps she has learnt from experience.\u201d\nTelevision.\nRachael works for the Seven Network as a reporter for several of its programs across current affairs and sports telecasts as well as making contestant appearances on Seven Network's in-house celebrity competition programs. She was one of the contestants in Celebrity MasterChef Australia in 2009. She progressed to the semi-finals, where she and \"Biggest Loser\" trainer Michelle Bridges made it through to the next stage. Rachael reached the grand-finals in which she came third overall. She also appeared in the 2010 series of \"Dancing with the Stars\". She was eliminated on 1 August 2010.\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" performances.\nIn late 2010, Rachael Finch joined the cast of the tenth season of \"Dancing with the Stars\".

Despite receiving some harsh comments from judge Todd McKenney over lack of content with their choreography, Finch and Miziner had been named the \"dark horse\" couple by the judges. Most unfortunately, and despite maintaining high scores, Finch and Miziner were the fifth couple eliminated on 1 August 2010.\n2010-present: After \"Dancing with the Stars\".\nRachael now does a daily weather report on Channel 7's morning show, \"Sunrise\".\nMiss Universe 2009.\n\"Main Article: Miss Universe 2009\" \nOn April 22, 2009, Rachael, then scarcely 19, was named the Australian nominee for Miss Universe 2009.

Blair won Miss Teen USA 2006. In 2011, she became Miss California USA. Katherine was also the first Montana native to win a pageant. \nEarly life.\nKatherine Blair was born on December 29, 1987, in Billings, Montana. She lived in Sugar Land, Texas for most of her life. She attended school from 9-11 grade at Stephen F. Austin High School. She graduated from Billings West High School in 2006. She planned to attend Louisiana State University, but postponed her commencement of college for her reign. \nPageants.\nMiss Teen USA, 2006.\nShe represented Montana in the Miss Teen USA 2006 pageant held in Palm Springs, California on August 15, 2006, and became the first Montana native to place in the pageant. Outgoing titleholder, Allie LaForce of Ohio, crowned her as the new Miss Teen USA. Melissa Lingafelt of North Carolina placed first runner-up. Before Katie's win in the nationally televised pageant, Montana had been the only state in the competition's 23-year history never to have had a semi-finalist.\nBlair's Miss Teen USA winnings included a one-year modeling contract with Trump Model Management and a scholarship to The School for Film and Television in New York City, and also a a guest appearance in the NBC soap opera \"Passions\".\nOn August 24, 2007, she passed on the Miss Teen USA title to Hilary Cruz of Colorado.\nReign.\nKatie spent her year as a titleholder in New York City, living in a Trump Place apartment with Miss Universe and Miss USA 2006, Tara Conner. During her reign, she made several appearances to raise money for charity.\nFollowing her win, she gave interviews with various media organizations, including WPIX New York and \"Dayside\" on Fox News. In September 2006, she returned to Billings, Montana for her official homecoming as Miss Teen USA. The city council announced the day as \"Katie Blair Day\" and awarded her a key to the city. She crowned Chelsea Nelson, also of Billings, as the next Miss Montana Teen USA 2007.\nBlair earned some distinction as the first Miss Universe Organization pageant winner to endorse YMI Jeanswear. Among other things, Katie was interviewed by Patty Lopez and Rick Dees, and participated in a billboard advertising campaign in Los Angeles and New York.\nLater in her reign, however, scandal erupted when she kissed Tara Conner at a nightclub in New York. A few days later, it was discovered Katie had been drinking underage (she was not yet 21). Katie initially denied the scandal, but later admitted to the charges, a move that probably took much courage and bravery, and resulted in her nearly losing her title. \nMiss California USA 2011.\nDecision to enter.\nKatie was initially hesitant about entering in another pageant, because of the scandal during her time as Miss Teen USA. As she explained during a phone interview in Los Angeles, \"I swore up and down I wasn't going to do a pageant again. But I wanted the opportunity to recover from my term as Miss Teen USA.\" Ultimately, Katie decided to enter the pageant. \nWinning the Pageant.\nBlair was originally 1st runner-up at Miss California USA 2011. The winner was Alyssa Campanella, who also was Miss New Jersey Teen USA 2007. On June 25, 2011, about a week after Campanella won Miss USA 2011, Miss California USA director Keith Lewis announced Blair as the new Miss California USA 2011, effectively giving her the title.\nWorking in Support of Charity.\nShe worked during her reign with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, along with the anti-bullying organization Love is Louder and the No H8 campaign (a silent protest in support of same-sex marriage, which was banned). \nFilmography.\nFilms.\nKatie has performed in one short movie, \"Jukebox\", where she played Edith. \nTV Shows.\nShe has performed four times in TV shows, including \"Hell\u00b4s Kitchen\" (in 2012), and \"Pageant Place,\" from 2007-2008. However, Katie did not enjoy her experiences in \"Pageant Place,\" which although billed as a reality TV show, actually scripted some of the dialogue. Katie explained, \"It put me in quite an unpleasant light\", adding \"I came off as immature, disrespectful, naive, young and ignorant.\" Katie has also performed in \"The Miss USA Teen Pageant.\""}

It works in the process of human reproduction. Some organs are outside the body, some are in the pelvis.\nThe main male sex organs are the penis and the testicles, which produce sperm. During sexual intercourse the penis delivers the sperm into a woman's vagina. The sperm can fertilize the egg cell in the woman's womb. The fertilized egg will develop into a fetus, which is later born as a baby.\nThe matched system in woman is the female reproductive system.\nsex organs.\nPenis.\nThe penis is an organ that is used for urination and sexual intercourse. The urethra is a passage runs underside of the penis. The urine and the semen are released through the urethra. When the male becomes sexually aroused, the penis becomes hard and bigger and ready for sexual intercourse. This erection occurs because the erectile tissue of the penis is filled with blood.\nScrotum.\nThe scrotum is a pouch-like structure that hangs behind the penis. It holds and protects the testicles. The function of the scrotum is to keep the testicles less warm than the rest of the body.\nTesticles.\nTesticles are the small ball-like organs. An adult testicle size is about 4 to 5 cm long. The testicles produce sperm cells from teenage years to old age. The sperm cells are produced in the seminiferous tubules, which are the main part of the testicles. After the sperms are produced, they are stored temporarily in the epididymis. The epididymis is covering the top of the testicle.\nTesticles are also called as the gonads and they are very important in sexual works. Leydig cells in the testicles product the testosterone. The testosterone cause puberty in boys and maintain the male characteristics for adult. If the testicles are removed, male characteristics are decreased.\nIntestinal cells of Leydig: These cells are mainly used in the production of the testosterone which flows into the blood streams and establish the secondary individuality of a person.\nThese characteristics include the beards, breaking of voice (deep voice) heavy bones (masculinity) and constricted pelvis that in charge of producing offspring.\nSeminal vesicle.\nThe seminal vesicles are a pair of tube-like glands. They are found behind the bladder. The seminal vesicle produces fluid that aids to alive the sperms after they are finally released.\nProstate gland.\nProstate gland is located under the bladder. It produces a thick fluid which aids the protection and transportation of the sperms which are now referred to as the semen.\nInfertility in Men - Male Reproductive Disorders.\nMost causes of infertility in men is as a result of male reproductive system disorders. An abnormal penis may not be able to deliver the semen properly. In hypospadias or epispadias where the opening of the penis is in an abnormal position, male infertility is a possibility.\nOther factors in male infertility.\nVaricocele: This is a condition characterized by enlargement, elongation and coiling of the blood vessels around the scrotum. Most times, it appears as bag of warm in the scrotum. It is seen in 10% of normal males and 40% of males with infertility.\nDrugs: Impotence in men has been found as side effects of some drugs like nitrofurantoin, antihypertensive drug particularly the sympatholytic ones, cimetidine, cancer drugs etc.\nIrradiation like X-ray, GSM etc. triggers release of free radicals and can directly halt the Spermatogenesis (process of sperm formation). This is the reason behind covering the scrotum (Testes) during X-ray.\nAutoimmune Antibodies: It has been found that some people have antibodies (defense chemicals) against their own sperm cells. By this interaction, the antibodies destroy the sperm cells leading to Azoospermia, oligospermia or normospermia depending on the degree of damage. This condition can be treated if diagnosed.\nLiver disease: The liver is a vital organ which ensures that the male hormone (testosterone) dominates in action than female hormone, oestrogen. This it does by breaking down the oestrogen continually. However in a case of liver disease which may impair liver functions, the level of female hormone, oestrogen, increases leading to male characteristics, loss of pubic hair and impotence."}

{"id": "762862", "revid": "54777", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762862", "title": "George Floyd protests", "text": "The George Floyd protests are ongoing protests and riots that started in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, Minnesota, United States. Unrest began in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, after the murder of George Floyd and continued into September. Floyd died while being arrested by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) on May 25. Protests spread to many cities in the United States, and later the world.\nSome of the protesters at the MPD's Third Precinct fought with law enforcement officers, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets. On May 27, one man was shot at a pawn shop and died. Witnesses recall hearing him say \"George is a monkey!\" Additionally, the Third Precinct's windows were smashed. A supermarket was looted, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. At least thirteen people were killed so because of the protests, but overall, most protests were peaceful. According to a September 2020 report by the U.S. Crisis Monitor, almost 95% of all protests were nonviolent.\nOn May 28, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a state of emergency, and Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz called in 500 Minnesota National Guard troops. More businesses across the Twin Cities were damaged and looted. \nMPD in the Third Precinct building attempted to hold off the protesters with tear gas, but around 11:00 pm, protesters overran the building and set it on fire. It had been evacuated. \nBoth Walz and Frey added curfews. U.S. President Donald Trump assured Walz of U.S. military support.\nThe activist group Black Lives Matter is involved in the protests, but the protests do not have one leader or one organization.\nThere were many attacks on journalists, both in the Twin Cities and at sister protests.\nBackground.\nThe George Floyd protests took place in the spring and early summer of 2020, shortly after the number of deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States reached 100,000. The COVID-19 pandemic had already affected black and other non-white Americans more than white Americans. Experts said that the protesters might spread the virus to each other.\nGovernor of New York Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday, May 30: \"You have a right to demonstrate. You have the right to protest. God bless America. You don't have a right to infect other people. You don't have a right to act in a way that's going to jeopardize public health. ... You can have an opinion but there are also facts, and you're wrong not to wear a mask.\"\nSome experts said the COVID-19 pandemic helped cause the George Floyd protests and made them larger. Scholar Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith of the Yale School of Medicine said, \"They are protesting against police brutality and excessive force, no question, but they're also protesting for the ability to live their lives fully and completely, and to not have their lives cut short, either by force or preventable diseases.\"\nExperts thought that the George Floyd protests would cause more people to catch COVID-19. In the United States, however, that did not happen as of July 1. Scientists said this could have been because the number of cases in large cities like New York was already going down, because the protests took place outside, because the protesters mostly wore masks, or because the protesters usually kept moving by walking or marching. Other experts said that because most of the protesters were young, healthy adults, perhaps they did catch COVID-19 and had not noticed.\nProtests.\nThere were sister protests in all 50 of the United States and in the capital, Washington, D.C. Some of the protests were peaceful and others had violence and looting. The National Guard moved out into more than 25 of the nation's 50 states.\nMany early protests were peaceful but some turned violent. In some places, police remained calm, and in others they used force, tear gas, and rubber bullets. In Washington, D.C. one man let more than 50 protesters come into his house so they could escape from the police who were chasing them. Two weeks into the protests, 9300 people had been arrested in the United States, including 1500 in New York and 2700 in Los Angeles. \nIn Newark, New Jersey, 12,000 people protested over the weekend of May 31, but no one damaged any stores and no one was arrested. The Newark Community Street Team, which formed in 2014, worked to prevent violence. Newark city leaders said that the young black Americans among the protesters were the reason the protest stayed peaceful. Camden, New Jersey and Flint, Michigan also had peaceful protests.\nProtesters outside the White House, the building in Washington, D.C. where the president lives, called for President Trump to resign. Some threw bottles. The United States Secret Service took President Trump to a bunker in the White House. On Monday, June 1, the Secret Service used tear gas on peaceful protesters outside the White House so President Donald Trump could walk to St. John's Church and have his picture taken with a Bible.\nOn the weekend of June 6-7, protests in the United States were even bigger but mostly peaceful, according to \"The New York Times\", and the protesters were more unified in what they wanted: police reform. There were tens of thousands of protesters in large cities like New York and Seattle and also protests in smaller towns like Marion, Ohio and Vidor, Texas. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday morning that New York City was stopping its 8:00 p.m. curfew.\nThe activist group Black Lives Matter sued the police department of Seattle, Washington on Tuesday June 9. That evening, protesters took over Seattle's city hall for about one hour. The protesters left city hall on their own; no one pushed them out. Protesters took over part of downtown Seattle, calling it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. At some point in June, there were four shootings in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. On July 1, city officials sent the police to clear the protesters out. They arrested 13 people.\nThe Georgia NAACP planned a March on Georgia for June 15. Thousands of people marched to the Georgia state capitol building to stop police brutality. The marchers also said they were marching because Georgia had made it harder for black people to vote by closing so many voting places that the ones that were left had very long lines, because they think Georgia's citizens' arrest laws are unfair, and because of the killing of Rayshard Brooks, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.\nIn New York City, a group called Street Riders NYC organized bicycle riders to ride through the city chanting \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" \"Say his name: George Floyd,\" and other slogans. Bicycle protests could have thousands of people, often riding through parts of the city where protesters do not usually go. One of Street Riders NYC's founders, Peter Kerre, told the \"New York Times\", \"We went deep, deep into the hood, places where these folks have never seen a march come through, and suddenly they're seeing 6,000 bikes. The reaction was just priceless, folks crying out with gratitude, coming out to say 'Thank you.'\"\nIn late June, protesters came to City Hall Park in New York City and built a camp there with a welcome desk, library, tea hut, and kitchens. They were led by the group Vocal-NY. They demanded that the city remove US$1 billion from the city's police department's $6 billion budget and spend it on education and other things. New York City decides on its yearly budget on July 1.\nJournalists.\nAs of June 4, journalists covering the protests were attacked more than 300 times, 192 of them by the police, including 69 physical attacks. 49 journalists were arrested.\nOn the morning of May 28, white Minneapolis police officers arrested Omar Jimenez, a reporter for CNN, and his crew while they were filming the protests. Jiminez is black. He told the officers that he and his crew were journalists and offered to move further away, but the officers arrested them anyway. They were released later that day. Walz apologized to CNN, and said publicly that Jiminez and his crew had only been doing their jobs and acting within their rights. A white CNN reporter who had been working a block away from Jiminez noted that he had not been bothered by the police, only asked who he was.\nIn Minneapolis alone, Linda Tirado of \"The Guardian\" was blinded in one eye. Ali Velshi of MSNBC was shot in the leg. In Washington, D.C., Amelia Brace and Tim Myers of 7News Australia were with the protesters who were pushed away so Donald Trump could walk to St. John's Church.\nSometimes protesters attacked journalists. In Washington D.C., protesters threw things at journalists from Fox News. In Atlanta, someone attacked CNN headquarters.\nSuzanne Nossel of the human rights group PEN America blamed President Trump, who has said bad things about journalists since before he was elected. Human rights lawyer Tendai Biti said it reminded him of dictatorships in Africa.\nViolence.\nAccording to a report written by the U.S. Crisis Monitor, Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), and the Bridging Divides Initiative of Princeton University, almost 95% of the protests were peaceful. They studied 10,600 protests between late May and late August and found that 10,100 had no violence. Only 570 protests had any violent acts. In cities where some protests were violent, it tended to happen in one or a few places and not through the whole city. Out of all protests connected to Black Lives Matter, 93% had no violence.\nInternational protests.\nThere were also protests outside the United States, in London, Toronto, Beijing, Berlin, Addis Ababa, and other places. Some of these international protesters said they wanted to support George Floyd but also bring attention to the racist actions by police in their own countries. In Toronto, protesters remembered the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a black woman who fell out of her balcony when the police were in her apartment. Londoners protested outside the Grenfell Tower where many blacks and Arabs died in a fire. Parisians remembered Adama Traor\u00e9, who died after being arrested by French police. Australians planned protests remembering David Dungay, an Australian Aboriginal man who died after being arrested. Dungay also said \"I can't breathe,\" twelve times. Some protesters have told their own leaders that they want new laws against racism.\nImpostors.\nAt least one white supremacist group, Identity Evropa, pretended to be on the protesters' side on Twitter. They said they were part of antifa and told protesters to loot white neighborhoods. They were caught, and Twitter took their posts down for breaking their rules about violence, spam, and fake accounts.\nCar collisions.\nAs of the first week of July, drivers drove cars into groups of protesters 66 different times in the United States alone. Seven of the drivers were police. At least two people died. 24 drivers have been charged with crimes.\nArrests by federal agents.\nIn mid-July in Portland, Oregon, federal agents began arresting protesters by pulling them into vehicles that did not have police markings on them. They did not tell the protesters exactly why they were being arrested. Some protesters were later charged with crimes and others were released.\nThese agents were from the federal government. Some of them were from Special Operations Group and Customs and Border Protection\u2019s BORTAC. Legally, federal agents are only allowed to arrest people on suspicion of federal crimes. Officially, they are only supposed to protect property that belongs to the U.S. federal government, but they have arrested people who were not near federal property. They did not ask the State of Oregon or the City of Portland for permission to arrest people in Portland. The mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, said he did not want the federal agents in the city. Governor of Oregon Kate Brown said it was \"political theater from President Trump has nothing to do with public safety\" and \"a blatant abuse of power by the federal government.\"\nOn July 18, Navy Seabee veteran Christopher David, 53, heard about the arrests and went to downtown Portland to talk to the agents. Federal agents take an oath to defend the United States Constitution. David wanted to ask the agents how they could wrongly arrest people and defend the Constitution. Instead of answering him, they sprayed him with pepper spray and hit him with batons. They broke his leg. The event was caught on video.\nOn the night of July 22-23, protesters in Portland came to a federal building and threw fireworks over the fence. Federal agents used tear gas on the crowd. They also tear-gassed Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who had come out to talk to the protesters.\nOther events.\nIn Brooklyn, New York, video showed an officer pushing a seventy-year-old man. The man fell down and bled from his head. Both were white. The officer, Vincent D'Andraia, had also hurt other protesters. He was suspended and charged with assault. D'Andraia was the first New York City police officer charged with a crime because of things he did during the George Floyd protests.\nIn Seattle, Washington, Nikolas Fernandez, 31, drove his car into a group of protesters and shot one man. He said he was afraid for his life because the protesters tried to grab him through his window. Firefighters took the man Fernandez shot to the hospital.\nIn Richmond, Virginia on Sunday, June 7, Harry H. Rogers drove his car into a group of protesters. Rogers, 36, is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist group. Authorities charged Rogers with attempted malicious wounding, felony vandalism, and assault and battery and the prosecutor said she would consider charging him with a hate crime.\nIn Chicago, Illinois on Monday, August 10, people broke windows and stole things in the Magnificent Mile, which is Chicago's main shopping area. Two people were shot. Thirteen police officers were injured. More than 100 people were arrested. The city raised the bridges leading to the Magnificent Mile and stopped public transit so no one else could go in. Mayor of Chicago Lori Lightfoot said that Chicago did not need Federal agents.\nDonations.\nPeople donated money to black-led political groups, especially bail funds. Bail funds provide money to help people who have been arrested get out of jail before their trials. The National Bail Fund Network got $75 million in two weeks. The Minnesota Freedom Fund got $20 million in four days. The Bail Project got more than $15 million. There was so much that some groups could not count it all. Black Lives Matter got $5 million from one petition alone. Some groups received so much money that they did not need more and told donors to go to other groups.\nDeaths.\nAs of June 9, 2020, nineteen people have died because of the protests:\nPublic opinion.\nAccording to Pew Research, two thirds of American adults thought the protests were good: 60% of white adults, 86% of black adults, 75% of Asian adults and 77% of Hispanic adults.\nSome said the Floyd protests showed America was losing its place as a leader of other countries. French journalist Pierre Haski said on June 1, \"Beijing could not have hoped for a better gift. The country that designates China as the culprit of all evils is making headlines around the world with the urban riots.\"\nGovernment response.\nReaction from Tim Walz.\nGovernor of Minnesota Tim Walz wanted change: \"It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect. George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction.\"\nOn June 2, 2020, Governor Walz said the Minnesota Department of Human Rights would investigate the Minneapolis Police Department. Governor Walz said, \"The investigation will review MPD's policies, procedures and practices over the last 10 years to determine if the department has utilized systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color.\"\nHuman Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said the Department could have the results of its report in \"several months.\"\nReaction from Donald Trump.\nPresident Donald Trump spoke about his sympathy for George Floyd and his family, but also called the protesters \"thugs\" and said \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter hid the post because it broke their rules about presenting violence as good. Trump blamed the protests on \"weak\" Democratic mayors and governors and on the anti-fascist movement antifa, saying he would declare it a terrorist organization.\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is black and a Republican (the same party as Trump), called Trump's tweets \"not constructive.\"\nOn June 1, Trump told the cities and states with protests that they must stop the trouble or else he would send the military to do it. The law that allows Trump to do this, the Insurrection Act of 1807, was last used in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.\nAlso on June 1, just before 7:00 p.m., when people had been ordered to stay off the street, police and Secret Service fired flash-bangs and tear gas at protesters near the White House. They did this to make the protesters leave St. John's Church. Then President Trump walked to St. John's Church, held up a Bible, and had his picture taken. Bishop Mariann E. Budde, the Episcopal religious leader for Washington D.C., said Trump did not say any prayers or talk about George Floyd. The next day, several Democrats and two Republicans said Trump was wrong to do this. Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, said. \"But there is a fundamental \u2014 a constitutional \u2014 right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the word of God as a political prop.\"\nReaction from the city of Minneapolis.\nOfficials from the Minneapolis announced on June 5 that the police were no longer allowed to use chokeholds on people. On June 7, the city council voted to take apart the police department and replace it with something else.\nReaction from the state of Minnesota.\nThe Minnesota state legislature attempted to write a new law that would redesign all police departments in Minnesota. In 2020, Minnesota's state legislature is the only one in the United States in which one political party controls one house and the other party controls the other. The United States Democratic Party has the majority of people in the Minnesota House of Representatives and the United States Republican Party has the majority of people in the Minnesota State Senate. The Democrats wanted large changes to policing and the criminal justice system in Minnesota, like letting the state attorney general investigate police killings and restoring voting rights to felons. The Republicans wanted small changes, like making a rule against using chokeholds like the one Chauvin used to kill George Floyd. Democrats said they did not like the Republican plan because it was mostly things that police departments had already tried. At midnight on Friday June 19, the Minnesota state legislature ran out of time. Their session ended, and neither plan became law.\nOther reactions.\nMany American cities and states removed statues of Confederate soldiers and officers during the George Floyd protests. Sometimes the protesters pulled the statues down and sometimes the city councils decided to remove them. On June 5, the United States Marine Corps announced they would not allow Confederate flags at their bases. The Confederates were the pro-slavery side of the American Civil War in the 1800s. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Confederate statues and flags support white supremacy. Protesters also damaged or pulled down statues of Christopher Columbus in at least seven cities, including Miami, Boston, Baltimore, Maryland, Richmond, Virginia and Columbus, Ohio. \nUniversities renamed buildings. Columbia University's medical school was founded by Samuel Bard, a doctor who knew George Washington. He also owned slaves. In 1931, Columbia named a dormitory building, Bard Hall, after him. Columbia's Teacher's College took the name Edward L. Thorndike off a building. Thorndike had hated Jews and supported sexism and eugenics. Princeton University renamed Wilson College because the man it was named after, President Woodrow Wilson, had racist policies.\nIn June, the United States Senate ordered the military to change the names of all military bases named after Confederates, such as Fort Bragg. They have three years to pick new names.\nIn Bristol, England, a crowd pushed down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it in the harbor. On July 15, people put up a statue of Jen Ried, a Black Lives Matter protester. The next day, the government of the city took the statue down because no one had asked for permission to put it up. The city officials took the statue to a museum. The statue is called \"A Surge of Power (Jen Reid)\" and was made by Marc Quinn."}

In general, cricket uses runs for scoring. In most cases, the team with the most runs wins the game. One run \n(known as a \"single\") can be scored after the bowler, who is in one batsman's ground, has thrown the ball to the batsman in the other ground. That batsman (known as the \"striker\") can hit the ball away from the fielders. Both the striker and the non-striker then run the length of the pitch, while running to the other ground. They will cross each other. To complete a run, both batsmen must \"make their ground\", meaning some part of their person or held bat touches the ground behind the crease (line) at the other end of the pitch. If the wicket in either ground is knocked off by a fielder with the ball when no batsman is in that ground, then the ball becomes dead and one of the batsmen (usually the one nearest to that ground) is run out of the game for the rest of the innings.\nThe batsman is given four runs if the ball rolls along the ground and hits the boundary. They are given six runs if the ball crosses the boundary while in the air and then touches the ground, similar to a home run in baseball.\nWhen it takes longer to recover the ball, the batsmen may run several times and score many runs.\nThe total score is gotten by adding up all runs.\nExtras.\nExtras (also sometimes called \"sundries\") are runs that are scored when the batsman did not hit the ball. This can happen because of an illegal throw by the bowler, or because the fielders did not stop the ball. \nRunners.\nA runner is a player who runs in order to score runs because one of the batsmen on the field is injured and can not run; that batsman will bat, while the runner is treated as doing the running for the batsman. Both the runner and the injured batsman can be run out; that is, if one of the pair is in a batsman's ground but the other is not, then running out the unsafe player is treated as running out both players. Runners have been banned in international cricket since 2011."}
