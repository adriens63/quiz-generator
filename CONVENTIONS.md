# Alignment conventions



## Lign breaks:
A single line between each party within the same function, 
two lines between functions within the same class, 
three lines between classes or independent functions. 



## Capitals:
Function and variables in snake_case, class and exceptions in CamelCase.



## Spaces:
A space between operations: 3 + 2, 
and after the commas.



## Presentation of functions:
Type-hint added this way:
``` 
def __init__(self, k: int) -> None:
        pass
``` 
The description of the function should be just after the definition in triple quotes.
