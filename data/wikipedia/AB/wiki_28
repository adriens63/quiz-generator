This takes work to educate people on what they can do to stop a dog from biting. People can get serious injuries or even die from dog bites. About 16,000\u201339,000 persons come near dogs and other animals that have rabies each year. These people receive immunizations to prevent or treat a rabies infection. Up to 800,000 Americans are treated for dog bites each year. Half of these are children. Young children get bitten by their family dog. Very old people are more likely to be bit than younger adults.\nAbout 4.5 million people in the US get bit by dogs each year. One out of five bites become infected. Dog bites are painful. \ndog bites can cause injuries or even death.\nCan you get bit?\nIf you know how to stop an dog from biting you will not be injured or die. Babies and children get bit more often than others. Small children can be bit if they walk toward or play with a dog. They should be watched by adults. Those children who are five-years-old to age nine are the most likely to be bit by a dog. Children need medical care for their bites more than adults. Men get bitten more than women. Over half of dog bites happen at home with dogs that are pets. If a home has many dogs then it is more likely that the people living in the home will be bitten. If there are two or more dogs in a home, the people in that home are fives more likely to be bitten.\nWhen a dog is friendly it still may bite. If a dog wags its tail people think the dog is friendly. When a dog wags its tail it can be afraid, ready to fight, or angry. Dogs can wag their tail and then bite a person.\nThings you can do.\nGovernment and other organizations have published information that can help stop a dog from biting. They say:\nPeople may know if the dog has already been seen growling, snapping or biting. This may be a dangerous dog and bite people. Dogs can show if they are going to bite because of how they stand and act. People can learn how to see how the dog looks and act. People can learn the body language of dogs and know when the dog might bite. If the dog is snarling, has a wrinkled nose, eyes that are black, and fur that stands up, the dog is dangerous and might bite.\nJust because a dog walks toward another dog or a person doesn't mean that it will bite. A dog is less likely to bite if more caution is practiced by the person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have published materials so that children and others can know how they should act around a dog. Acting in a safe way will reduce the chance of a bite:\nIf you are attacked.\nEven if you are attacked by a dog, you can protect yourself.\nFind a doctor:\nTraining a dog makes it less dangerous. Children can learn how to not get bitten by a dog."}

It was first described for science in 1857 by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott. That description was based on material collected in Sierra Leone by Adam Afzelius. Schott named the species after him. The genus \"Anubias\" was described at the same time. Only \"A. afzellii\" belonged to it. This is therefore the type species of the genus. \"A. afzelii\" was the first species of this genus known to science.\nWhere it grows.\nThe plant is found in West Africa: Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Mali.\nDescription.\nThe plant's leave blades are elongated (long and thin) and leathery. They can be up to long and wide. The leaf stems are generally shorter than the blade. The leaves are set on a creeping and rooting rhizome. It is thick. The spathe is long (sometimes up to 9 cm long). It has a long peduncle. The spadix is long (sometimes up to 12 cm long). It is a little bit longer than the spathe. Therefore, the tip of the spadix sticks a little bit out of the spathe. The upper part of the spadix is covered with male flowers. Their 5-6 stamens are fused. The anthers (also called thecae) are on the sides. The lower part of the spadix is covered with female flowers. These are reduced to the ovary and stigma.\nEcology.\nThe plant grows in wet, shady places. It flowers from the end of March to July. It fruits from April to September. The plant grows above water, but can sometimes be completely under water.\nGrowing conditions.\nThis plant grows best when only partly under water and when not crowded by other plants. It is most suited for the paludarium. It can also be used in larger aquariums, where it grows very slowly. It does not need much light. It prefers a temperature range of 22-26 \u00b0C.

After this, his mother had to sell, at a loss, their modest property in order to pay the family\u2019s debts. Because the family was so poor, Alberto and his brother had to go to live with relatives and were often moved from one family member to another.\nHowever, Alberto got a scholarship that allowed him to study at the famous all-boys Jesuit school of St. Ignacio, Santiago. He studied there from 1909 to 1917. At the parish and school, Hurtado assisted in the office and was librarian. During this time, he also volunteered at the Parroquia Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Andacollo, a Catholic parish and school in a poor neighborhood of Santiago.\nFernando Vives, a teacher at the St. Ignacio school, was one of the most important people in Hurtado's life.

However, he was able to go back to school afterward, and earned his degree early in August 1923.\nPriesthood and studies.\nRather than starting a career in law, Hurtado entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1923. \nIn 1925, he went to C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, where he studied humanities. \nIn 1927 he was sent to Barcelona, Spain, to study philosophy and theology, but because of the suppression of the Jesuits in Spain in 1931, he went on to Belgium and continued his studies in theology at Louvain. He was ordained a priest there on 24 August 1933, and in 1935 obtained a doctorate in pedagogy and psychology.\nCanonization.\nHurtado was canonized on October 23, 2005, by Pope Benedict XVI, becoming his country's second saint."}

He is the most successful High School Football coach in Kentucky state history, having won 12 state championship titles, and 1 National Championship over the course of his forty-year long career.\nIn 2011, he was named by \"USA Today\" as the National High School Coach of the Year. Beatty was the East's head coach at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in 2012.\nIn 2013, he was named by \"Athlon Sports\" as the tenth most important High School Football Coach in the United States. On January 10, 2017, he was given the Key to the City of Louisville, Kentucky, by Mayor (and Trinity graduate) Greg Fischer.\nPersonal Life.\nBeatty was born on June 7, 1955, in Butler, Missouri. In 1974, he went to Missouri Southern State College, where he graduated in 1978 with a Bachelor's in Education. In 1980, Beatty married his wife Jayne. They have two grown up children, Jennifer and David.\nCoaching career.\nClinton High School.\nBeatty's Coaching Career began in 1978, when he took a job as an Assistant Coach at Clinton High School in Clinton, Missouri. He worked there for two years, then he moved to Liberty, Missouri. Beatty was also a teacher during that time.\nWilliam Jewell College.\nIn 1980, Beatty took a job as the Offensive Coordinator for William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. He worked at the job from 1981 to 1986. Beatty then left the college and moved to Blue Springs, Missouri. Beatty was also a teacher during that time.\nBlue Springs High School.\nIn 1986, Beatty took a job as the Offensive Coordinator at Blue Springs High School, in Blue Springs, Missouri. He was there until 1997, when he was offered the position of head coach. He took the role and was their head coach until the year 2000, when he moved to Louisville, Kentucky. Beatty was also a teacher during that time.\nTrinity High School.\nBeatty came to Trinity High School in 2000 to be the head coach of the Trinity Shamrocks Football team. The very next year, Beatty led the team to victory over rival Male High School in the 2001 state championship. Beatty kept up his winning streak by winning the state championships in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. However, in 2013, the Shamrocks ended the season 6-6. Beatty took this as a sign that his team needed a complete makeover. He said: \"It's been a long time since we ended a season with a loss. You find out whether you want to spit that taste out of your mouth or swallow it again.\"\nBeatty chose to follow up these words with a plan. He fired all but one of his defensive coordinators, and hired Jay Cobb, a former head coach at Knott County Central, Somerset, and Campbellsville, as the new defensive coordinator. After the shakeup, Trinity went on to win the state championship the next year in 2014, as well as in 2016.\nIn addition to serving as the Head Football Coach, Beatty also works at Trinity as a teacher for freshmen at the school. He teaches a course that combines Physical Education, as well as Health education, which includes information on drugs, alcohol and tobacco, as well as anatomy and physiology.\nState Championship Record.\nBelow is a list of Trinity High School's State Championship Wins during the tenure of Head Coach Bob Beatty.\nCoaching Record at Trinity.\nBelow is a year-by-year breakdown of Beatty's coaching record at Trinity.\nCoaching Method.\nIn late May of 2013, a Trinity player approached Beatty and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for practice to start.\u201d Beatty allegedly was startled by the comment. \u201cYou\u2019re ready for me to scream and yell and cuss and spit?\u201d he asked. \u201cSure,\u201d the player said. \u201cYou\u2019re not my friend. You\u2019re my coach.\" According to Beatty, he had to smile, because that\u2019s the way he approaches his players. \u201cI don\u2019t have 17-year-old friends, I have 17-year-old champions.\"\nAccording to Beatty, his team trains, practices, and plays for 11 months of the year. In 2013, he stated, \"If you are going to be in this program, you have to punch the clock.\" In late April, when Beatty starts practices for the next season, Beatty allegedly tells his players \"You better pray hard, because you belong to me now.\" He also stated in an interview that \"We try to get more done in two hours than other teams do in two weeks. There are no superfluous meetings. It\u2019s all about efficiency and winning.\"\nFormer Players.\nBeatty has sent many of his former players to the NCAA D-I level. He coached quarterback Brian Brohm, who was featured on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" while he was a junior in high school at Trinity and who later played for the Louisville Cardinals, as well as with the Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills. Beatty also coached former quarterback Nick Petrino, who is the son of Louisville Cardinals football coach Bobby Petrino."}

The city has a population of around 280,170 people.\nHistory.\nEvidence shows that people have lived in the Petrozavodsk region since seven thousand years ago. At the end of the sixteenth century, there was a settlement in the region that was named \"Onegaborg\".\nDuring the Finnish occupation of Petrozavodsk, the city was named \"\u00c4\u00e4nislinna\" (or \"\u00c4\u00e4neslinna\"). The city was retaken by the Soviet army on 28 June 1944. The Finns set up concentration camps in the city for people of non-Finnic ethnicity. In total, six camps were set up; which in total held 23,984 civilians of Russian ethnicity.\nIn 1977, the Petrozavodsk phenomenon occurred. This was an incident where a glowing object showered the city with many rays. Many people now believe that it was caused by the launch of the Soviet satellite Kosmos 955.\nThe Petrozavodsk State University is located in the city. The university is made up of 9 faculties and 6 institutes, and was founded on 1 September 1940.\nThere are many popular landmarks in Petrozavodsk. One of them is \"Lenin Square,\" which is an oval space with a large Vladimir Lenin statue in the center. The suburb of \"Martsialnye Vody\" is the oldest spa in Russia. It was founded in 1714 by Peter the Great. Petrozavodsk is home to the Karelia Philharmonic Orchestra, the Karelian Musical Theater, the National Library of Karelia, the National Theatre of Karelia and a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Petrozavodsk experiences a subarctic climate. However, the city has much milder temperatures than other cities in that climate. This is mainly because of the city's position next to the Baltic Sea. The average annual temperature is 3.1 \u00b0C. Temperatures in winter range from 0 to -15 \u00b0C, in summer from +5 to +25 \u00b0C. The record high temperature was 33.9\u00a0\u00b0C (93.0\u00a0\u00b0F), and the record low temperature was \u221241.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221242.9\u00a0\u00b0F)."}

When he was 11 years old he had no father and no mother. Because of that, he had to work to survive. He worked making glass objects for a man called\u00a0Philipp Anton Weichelsberger.\nOne day, in 1801, the place where Fraunhofer was working fell down and was destroyed. Fraunhofer was inside when this happened. Luckily, some people found him in the middle of the bits of the house and saved him. The prince of Bavaria was with these people and he decided to help Fraunhofer.\nThe prince decided to give Fraunhofer money and books to study. He studied for five years and one day he was invited to work for a man called Joseph Utzschneider. This man had a company that made glass lenses to be used in scientific instruments. And this company had a secret laboratory in a monastery called Benediktbeuern. In this laboratory people were trying to discover how to make better glass lenses. Glass lenses at that time was a very complicated technology. After three years, Fraunhofer was one of the directors of this company. And after eight years he was a partner of the owner.\nFraunhofer died very sick in 1826, probably because of the time he worked as a child.\nSpectroscopy.\nDuring his time in Benediktbeuern, Fraunhofer made experiments with glass. He discovered very important things about light. One day Fraunhofer was playing with a piece of glass called a \"prism\" and a telescope in a room full of sun light. When he used the telescope to look at the glass he discovered that he could see all colours of the rainbow. But there were black lines between the colours. Fraunhofer never discovered what the black lines were; he suggested they might be boundaries between different colors. Many years later, scientists discovered that these black spectral lines existed because some materials that exist in the sun and in the sky can absorb parts of the light. Today scientists use a similar technique to discover what chemicals are in stars and planets. The scientists who tried to find out what was happening call this part of science \"spectroscopy\"."}

Every cell in a cell line has the same genes. Since their discovery, scientists have been using HeLa cells to study cancer, radiation poisoning, and infectious disease. Like most cancer cells, HeLa cells have more DNA than normal cells. HeLa cells can also divide forever without the help of scientists. In contrast, normal, non-cancerous cells can only divide a for a little while before their telomeres shorten too much and the cell cannot divide any longer. HeLa cells have a special type of active telomerase that extends telomeres during regular division.\nOrigin.\nIn 1951, these cells were found in a cervical tumor of 30 year old Henrietta Lacks. A sample of the tumor was taken during Lacks' stay at Johns Hopkins Hospital by a doctor named George Gey. He did this without telling her. Lacks died later that year, but her neither her nor her family were ever told about the cells until many decades later.\nApplications.\nOne of the most famous uses for HeLa cells came when Jonas Salk used these cells to test his vaccine, which now protects a lot of people against polio. Some of the more recent uses for HeLa cells are a Human papillomavirus vaccine made by Harold zur Hausen. This vaccine won him a Nobel Prize in 2008. Another use for HeLa cells is telomerase research, which won Elizabeth Blackburn a 2009 Nobel Prize. HeLa cells have also been used for the development of new chemotherapy techniques and to test how and where nuclear radiation mutates cells. \nDebate.\nThe use of HeLa cells has drawn some criticism. This is because Henrietta Lacks did not know that a piece of her tumor had been taken. When Lacks was identified nearly twenty years later, it raised a lot of questions about the issue of medical consent. Consent is when someone gives permission for something to happen. By law, there are several rules put in place to protect people involved in scientific research from harm. These rules also apply to research samples, which are allowed to be used as long as the quality of care is maintained and the patient identity is protected. One paper notes that if Henrietta Lacks were alive today, doctors would not need to ask for her consent.\nSome people find it concerning that Henrietta Lacks wasn't asked for permission. This is because a lot of molecular biology techniques rely on DNA sequencing, so whenever the results of an experiment are published, the genetic information of the subject used is also put on full display. This is less of a problem when the identity of the sample's origin is fully protected, but troubling in the case of Henrietta Lacks. This is because full genome sequencing can reveal personal information like race, sex, and genetic history. In 2013, the entire HeLa cell line genome sequence was made public without the consent of Lacks' surviving family. Even though pieces of the HeLa genome have been sequenced separately, it is still possible to find genetic sequences that are often inherited together. This has the potential to reveal information about Lacks' surviving family. Critics argue that this represents a serious breach of privacy on behalf of the Lacks family. Since then, a new National Institutes of Health policy requires that researchers apply for special permission to access the full genome sequence."}

They are filled with sediment. They are formed by retreating glaciers or by draining floodwaters.\nPotholes can be formed when big blocks of ice break off of glaciers. The blocks become covered by sediment the glacier leaves behind. When the block melts, the hole it leaves behind is a pothole.\nPotholes can also be formed when an ice-dammed lake suddenly drains away. As the ice melts, ramparts can form around the edge of the pothole. The lakes that fill these holes are usually deep or less. They eventually become filled with sediment. In acid conditions, a bog may form. In alkaline conditions, it will be peatland.\nOverview.\nKettles are landforms created by melted water from glaciers, a process called \"fluvioglacial.\" When warming weather conditions cause a glacier to start melting, large blocks of ice can break off in a process called \"calving.\" Rather than melting on the surface of the ground, the ice block can get partially or totally buried by dirt, rocks, and plant matter - the \"sediment\" carried in the glacier together with its ice content. This sediment piles up on the land where the glacier had been, a broad, smooth stretch called an \"outwash plain\" (or \"sandur\"). The kettle hole occurs when the exposed or buried ice block melts so that the surface of the sandur sinks. Multiple kettle holes can form near each other, and with the ridges and mounds of sediment around them the smooth surface of the sandur becomes irregular. Kettle holes can also occur in ridge-shaped deposits of loose rock chunks called \"till.\"\nKettle holes can also form when a lake has a large amount of ice blocking the outlet where water drains from it, and the ice breaks up all at once. The flood that this causes can carry blocks of ice and sediment similar to the glacier-calf activity described above. These floods are called \"j\u00f6kulhlaups,\" an Islandic term used wherever this occurs. In 1992, the geologist Judith Maizels made outdoor observations and reproduced the conditions in a laboratory simulation. She found that protective walls (called ramparts) (protective walls) form around the edge of kettle holes made by j\u00f6kulhlaup floods. The type of ramparts that develop depends on the how concentrated are the rock fragments contained in the melted ice block, and also on how deeply the block was buried by sediment.\nMost kettle holes are less than two kilometres in diameter, although some in the U.S. Midwest exceed ten kilometres. Puslinch Lake in Ontario, Canada, is the largest kettle lake in Canada, covering . Fish Lake in the north-central Cascade Mountains of the U.S. state of Washington is .\nThe depth of most kettles is less than ten meters. In most cases, kettle holes eventually fill with water, sediment, or plant growth (vegetation). If the kettle gets more water from surface or underground rivers or streams, it becomes a kettle lake. If the kettle gets its water from rainfall and/or snowfall (precipitation), existing groundwater, or a combination of the two, it is termed a kettle pond. A kettle wetland is a kettle pond in which plant matter grows. Kettle ponds that are not affected by the local groundwater table will usually become dry during the warm summer months, in which case they are called \"ephemeral\" (something which disappears on its own).\nKettle bogs.\nIf water in a kettle becomes acidic due to decomposing organic plant matter, it becomes a kettle bog. Otherwise, if underlying soils are lime-based, which has the effect of neutralizing the acidic conditions somewhat, it becomes a kettle peatland. Kettle bogs are closed ecosystems because they have no water source other than precipitation (rainfall and snowfall). Both acidic kettle bogs and fresh water kettles are important ecological niches for some symbiotic (mutually dependent) species of flora and fauna.\nThe Kettle Moraine, a region of Wisconsin covering an area from Green Bay at Lake Michigan to south-central Wisconsin, has numerous kettles, moraines and other glacial features. It has many kettle lakes, some of which are 100 to deep. Kettle Point, Ontario, Canada, has rock concretions (where sediment naturally cements into hard masses) locally named 'kettles', but there are no kettle lakes in this region.\nExamples of kettles.\nThe Prairie Pothole Region extends from northern Alberta, Canada to Iowa, United States and includes thousands of small sloughs (shallow bodies of usually stagnant water in a wetland) and lakes."}

Its first line, the Green Line, was the first subway in the Western Hemisphere. At first, it connected only the Boston Public Garden to Park Street Station - about a half-mile walk.\nToday, all together, the parts of the MBTA travel 1392 miles each way, every day.p.3\nParts of the MBTA.\nThe MBTA uses many different forms of public transportation to connect most of the parts of Massachusetts. As of the MBTA's last official report in 2014, there are 295 different MBTA stations in Massachusetts.p.6\nCommuter Rail.\nThe Commuter Rail covers more of Massachusetts than any other part of the MBTA. The Commuter Rail is a fast train, similar to an Amtrak commuter train. Of all the MBTA's services, the Commuter Rail runs the farthest from Boston. Because of this, it is also the most expensive.\nIn the MBTA's color-coding system, Commuter Rail Trains are purple.\nAs of 2014, there were a total of 138 Commuter Rail stations in Massachusetts.p.7\nAll Commuter Rail trains start or finish their journeys at one of two stations in Boston: South Station or North Station.\nSouth Station.\nCommuter Rail trains run to South Station from towns like:\nWhen the New England Patriots are playing at home, the MBTA runs special Commuter Rail trains to Gillette Stadium from both South Station and T.F. Green Airport.\nCloser to Boston, Commuter Rail trains stop at a few different Boston neighborhoods on their way to South Station, like Back Bay, Jamaica Plain, Hyde Park, and Dorchester. \nTravelers can change to the MBTA's Red Line subway at South Station.\nNorth Station.\nCommuter Rail trains run to North Station from towns like:\nCloser to Boston, Commuter Rail trains run through towns near Boston, like Cambridge, Chelsea, Medford, Melrose, and Belmont.\nTravelers can change to the MBTA's Green or Orange Lines at North Station.\nThe Subway.\nThe subway runs mostly in Boston and in the towns next to it. There are five different subway lines, which are color-coded. Each line runs to a different part of the city. There are a total of 66 different subway routes in the Boston area. The lines cross each other at different points throughout the city so people can switch lines when they need to. A person does not have to pay to switch from one underground subway to another.\nEach train runs in one of two directions: Inbound or Outbound. If a train is traveling toward Downtown Crossing, it is an Inbound train. If a train is traveling away from Downtown Crossing, it is an Outbound train.\nOrange Line.\nThe Orange Line began running in 1901. At that time, it was the first public transit in Boston that was elevated (on train tracks above the streets, instead of on the streets or underground).\nThe Orange Line runs from Malden to Jamaica Plain. It has 19 stops, including stops at Bunker Hill Community College, Tufts Medical Center, Boston's Chinatown, and Haymarket (a famous outdoor food market).\nThe Orange Line intersects with every other line on the MBTA. Travelers can change to any color subway or trolley car from the Orange Line.\nRed Line.\nThe Red Line was the last of the four subway lines to be built.\nToday, the Red Line runs from Cambridge to inner-city Boston. Important stops include Harvard Square Station; Kendall/MIT Station; Charles/Massachusetts General Hospital; and JFK/UMASS (the stop for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and the University of Massachusetts Boston. The Red Line intersects with the Commuter Rail, and with every other subway except the Blue Line.\nThe Red Line is the most used subway line on the MBTA. On average, about 74,450,000 people make trips on the Red Line every year.\nBlue Line.\nThe Blue Line was built in 1904 as the world's widest underwater streetcar tunnel. (The Blue Line travels under the Charles River). By 1924, the Blue Line had been made into a subway.\nToday, the Blue Line runs from Revere and East Boston to a small part of downtown Boston. It stops at Wonderland, which used to be a greyhound racing track; Suffolk Downs, which still is a horse racing track; Revere Beach; Logan Airport; Government Center, where Boston City Hall is located; and the New England Aquarium. Free shuttle buses take travelers from the Airport MBTA Station to the terminals in the airport.\nThe Blue Line is used less than any other MBTA subway line. About 17,880,000 people make trips on the Blue Line every year - about 76% less than the number of people who use the Red Line each year.\nGreen Line.\nPart of the green line is a street trolley. It runs along train tracks in the middle of Boston's streets. However, some of the Green Line is a subway (underground). This part of the Green Line goes from Cambridge to downtown Boston. The Green Line then splits into five different street trolleys that travel to different neighborhoods around Boston.\nLongwood Station on the D line, and the Longwood Medical Area Station on the E line, are within walking distance of multiple world-class hospitals, including Brigham and Women's Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Joslin Clinic for Diabetes, and Boston Children's Hospital.\nThe Green Line is the second most popular subway line on the MBTA. The Red Line is used a little more often.\nStreet Trolleys.\nThere are four different street trolleys. These Green Line trolleys are called the \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" and \"E\" trains. There are many trolley stops on the MBTA - 61 in total.p.7\nEach train but the \"E\" train splits off from the underground subway at Kenmore Station. This is the station closest to Fenway Park, where the Boston Red Sox play.\nThe E train splits off from the underground subway at Copley Station. Its stops include the Prudential Tower, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Northeastern University, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Its last stop is at the VA Medical Center in Jamaica Plain. It is the only part of the MBTA that runs on tracks in the middle of the street.\nRapid bus lines.\nThe MBTA has 4 rapid transit bus lines with a total of 30 stops. These are color-coded silver:\nCommuter Boats.\nThe MBTA also includes commuter boat lines:\nBuses.\nThe MBTA operates 174 different buses. Together, these buses travel a total of 745 miles, one way, each day.p.e\nThe two most commonly used buses on the MBTA both average about 14,000 riders every day:\nSummary.\nThis table gives a summary of the different parts of the MBTA:\nCriticism.\nSafety.\nSome travelers have brought up concerns about safety on the MBTA. In a 2011 article, \"Boston Magazine's\" Jason Schwartz described serious concerns about safety issues on the MBTA - like train fires, and crucial safety issues which he said the MBTA had not addressed. He wrote: \"The system is broke, broken, and about to get a whole lot worse. No one on Beacon Hill [in the Massachusetts government] wants to address any of this ... History shows that it takes a tragedy - deaths - to fix something as basic as infrastructure. Hopefully Massachusetts won't wait for that.\"\nIn 2014, Robert Murch, a \"world-renowned Ouija board\" expert, joked that he is more afraid of taking the Red Line than he is of ghosts.\nThe MBTA has put many programs into place to help prevent crime and terrorism on the MBTA. The latest report published by the MBTA Transit Police compared crime rates in 2014 and 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, there was about a 7% increase in crimes on the MBTA. In 2014, there were 946 reported crimes on the MBTA. In 2015, there were 1009. Since over 380,900,000 people ride the MBTA each year, this means that about 0.0003% of travelers were victims of a crime while riding the MBTA in 2015. Most of these crimes were larceny, robbery, or assault.\nConvenience.\nSome Boston residents have criticized the slowness of the trains, especially the Green Line trolleys. Kyle Scott Clauss, the author of \"The Curmudgeon's Guide to the MBTA,\" writes: \"The C branch [of the Green Line] essentially functions as a sort of moving sidewalk leading to and from the Trader Joe's in Coolidge Corner. It was where Kenyan runner Rita Jeptoo memorably cruised past a Green Line trolley on her way to a first-place finish in the 2014 Boston Marathon.\"\n2015 Blizzards.\nThe MBTA experienced a major crisis in winter of 2015. This was the snowiest winter in Boston's history, with six weeks of blizzards and heavy snowstorms. In February alone, 64.8 inches of snow fell in Boston. The MBTA's train tracks were so frozen and covered with snow that the trains could not drive. Kyle Scott Clauss of \"The Curmudgeon's Guide to the MBTA\" joked that \"During the Snowpocalpyse of 2015 ... the T's newly installed countdown clocks all read \"NOW I AM BECOME DEATH\" and workers had to literally \"set the rails ablaze\" to keep them from freezing...\"\nThe General Manager of the MBTA, Beverly Scott, shut down all rail service (all trains and trolleys) for over 36 hours. The MBTA had to hire hundreds of workers to shovel snow and chip ice off the tracks. On February 11, Scott announced that she would resign from her job, as of April 11, 2015."}

Such citizens could not vote or be elected in Roman elections. Slaves were considered property and lacked legal personhood. Over time, they acquired a few protections under Roman law. The rights available to individual citizens of Rome varied over time, according to their place of origin, and their service to the state. They also varied under Roman law according to the classification of the individual within the state. Various legal classes were defined by the various combinations of legal rights that each class enjoyed. However, the possible rights available to citizens with whom Roman law addressed were:\nThe toga was the characteristic garment of the Roman male citizen, and statues of emperors (here Antoninus Pius) frequently depict them togate (togatus).\nIus suffragiorum: The right to vote in the Roman assemblies.\nIus gentium: The legal recognition, developed in the 3rd century BC, of the growing international scope of Roman affairs, and the need for Roman law to deal with situations between Roman citizens and foreign persons. The ius gentium was therefore a Roman legal codification of the widely accepted international law of the time, and was based on the highly developed commercial law of the Greek city-states and of other maritime powers.[4] The rights afforded by the ius gentium were considered to be held by all persons; it is thus a concept of human rights rather than rights attached to citizenship.\nIus conubii: The right to have a lawful marriage with a Roman citizen according to Roman principles,[5] to have the legal rights of the paterfamilias over the family, and for the children of any such marriage to be counted as Roman citizens.\nIus migrationis: The right to preserve one's level of citizenship upon relocation to a polis of comparable status. For example, members of the cives Romani (see below) maintained their full civitas when they migrated to a Roman colony with full rights under the law: a colonia civium Romanorum. Latins also had this right, and maintained their ius Latii if they relocated to a different Latin state or Latin colony (Latina colonia). This right did not preserve one's level of citizenship should one relocate to a colony of lesser legal status; full Roman citizens relocating to a Latina colonia were reduced to the level of the ius Latii, and such a migration and reduction in status had to be a voluntary act.\nThe right of immunity from some taxes and other legal obligations, especially local rules and regulations.[6]\nThe right to sue in the courts and the right to be sued.\nThe right to have a legal trial (to appear before a proper court and to defend oneself).Auxilia and gained citizenship through service."}

It was in Poland, which was controlled by Germany at that time. The camp was in a forest northeast of Warsaw.\nThe goal of death camps like Treblinka was to kill millions of people as quickly as possible. Treblinka was open from July 23, 1942, to October 19, 1943, during Operation Reinhard, the deadliest part of The Holocaust. At Treblinka, the Nazis killed at least 700,000 and 900,000 Jewish people, and at least 2,000 Roma people. The Nazis killed more Jews at Treblinka than at any death camp other than Auschwitz.\nTreblinka I: Labor camp.\nNazi officials opened Treblinka in November 1941 as a forced labor camp. The Nazis sent two groups of people to Treblinka to work as slaves:\nHowever, they kept the Jews and Poles in separate parts of the camp.\nMost of the prisoners at Treblinka worked in a gravel pit; in an irrigation area; or in the forest, where they cut wood to fuel the camp's cremation ovens. \nBetween 1941 and 1944, more than 20,000 people were prisoners at Treblinka I. More than half of them died from hunger, disease, mistreatment, and summary executions (executions without a trial).\nTreblinka II: Death camp.\nIn July 1942, the Nazis finished building Treblinka II, a death camp, about a mile from the labor camp (Treblinka I). At this time in history, the Nazis were already killing people at two other death camps: Belzec and Sobibor.\nThe Nazis committed genocide at Treblinka until November 1943. They murdered up to 925,000 Jewish people at the camp. They killed many of them with carbon monoxide in gas chambers.\n\"Sonderkommando\".\nMost Jewish men who were sent to Treblinka were killed right away. However, a few were chosen to be its slave-labor units, called \"Sonderkommando.\" When the Nazis murdered people in the gas chambers, they forced the \"Sonderkommando\" to bury the victims' bodies in mass graves. These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air pyres, along with the bodies of new victims. \nIn early August 1943, the \"Sonderkommando\" revolted. Several Nazi guards were killed and about 200 prisoners escaped from the camp; almost a hundred survived the subsequent chase. Because of this, in October 1943, the Nazis stopped killing prisoners in Treblinka's gas chambers.\nDestruction.\nIn late July 1944, Soviet troops were getting close to Treblinka. There were between 300 and 700 Jewish prisoners left at the camp. The Nazi guards shot them all. The Nazis then quickly destroyed the camp. Before running away, they built a farmhouse for a watchman and sloughed over the ground to try to hide the evidence of their genocide. Then they ran away from the camp.\nDuring the last week of July 1944, Soviet troops arrived at Treblinka."}

The short 'a' and short 'o' of American English are absent in Indian languages and their use can often result in mispronunciation of Indian names.\nFurthermore, the letters used in English for the retroflex consonants (t and d) are also used to sound dentals (as in 'math' and 'the'), especially when they occur in the beginning of a word. As an example, the India name 'Dev' would not have its first consonant pronounced as in the American name 'Dave'. Similarly the name 'Tarun' would not have its first consonant sounded as in 'Tom'.\nThe letter 'h' is used to aspirate certain consonants.

{"id": "586827", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586827", "title": "Taliban insurgency", "text": "After the war in Afghanistan began in 2001, the Taliban started an insurgency, which is known as the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban started to attack the forces of ISAF and NATO, in Afghanistan, and committed many terrorist attacks. In the conflict, the Taliban fight against the Afghan government and its allies. Al-Qaeda is linked to the Taliban. With this, the conflict in the region spread to Pakistan. The related conflict in Pakistan is the insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nBecause Afghanistan has seen a number of conflicts and wars in recent decades, its economy has changed, and many people depend on growing cash crops, such as poppy seeds which are used to produce illegal drugs such as opium, or heroin. Many people in Afghanistan do not think the problems are caused by the Taliban. Resolving the problem will therefore probably involve more effort than winning against the Taliban. It will also mean that there need to be changes in the economy, and the way in which the country is run.\nOpium trade.\nCurrently, Afghanistan is one of the biggest producers of opium. While opium also has its uses as a regular drug, it is mainly used as an illegal drug. In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium, today it produces over ninety percent. In 2007, 93% of the \"non-pharmaceutical-grade\" opiates on the world market originated in Afghanistan. This amounts to an export value of about $4 billion; opium farmers earn about a quarter of this amount, the rest goes to district officials, insurgents, warlords, and drug traffickers. The drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP. \nEstimates made in 2006 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimate that 52% of the nation's GDP, or $2.7 billion annually, is generated by the drug trade.\nAreas where the security situation is worse produce more Opium; areas that are more stable seem to produce less. Many farmers in rural areas depend on selling poppy seeds. Opium is more profitable than wheat and destroying opium fields could possibly lead to discontent or unrest among the affected population. Some 3.3 million Afghans are involved in producing opium. For this reason, some people say that eradicating poppy crops is not a viable option. Some poppy eradication programs have, however, proven effective, especially in the north of Afghanistan. The opium poppy eradication program of Balkh Governor Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor between 2005 and 2007 successfully reduced poppy cultivation in Balkh Province from 7,200 hectares in 2005 to zero by 2007.\nThe Afghanistan Opium Risk Assessment 2013, issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, suggests that the Taliban has since 2008 been supporting farmers growing poppy, as a source of income for the insurgency.\nThe Taliban are not seen as a cause of the problem.\nThere have been wars and conflicts in Afghanistan for over thirty years. As a result, the country is among the poorest, and least developed countries in the world. It is also one of the most corrupt. Thirty-five percent of the poulation are unemployed, and more than half of the people live below the poverty line.\nWestern aid group Oxfam published an opinion poll they conducted in Afghanistan, in 2010. According to this poll, 83 percent of the Afghan population does not consider the Taliban to be militants. Poverty, unemployment and government corruption are seen as the main causes of war in their country. When the U.S.-backed Afghan forces ousted the Taliban in late 2001, the level of violence increased. Nearly half of those surveyed said corruption and bad government were the main reasons for the ongoing war. Twelve percent said the Taliban insurgency was to blame.After the Taliban, the reason most people gave for the continued fighting was foreign interference, with twenty-five percent of respondents saying other countries were to blame.\n2006 escalation.\nSince the start of 2006 Afghanistan has been facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006.\nAfghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said:\nInsurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have \"sharply escalated in 2006\" with \"at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects.\" 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded).\nThe United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war, despite the increase of foreign troops."}

The most common kind of inversion in English is subject\u2013auxiliary inversion, which happens when an auxiliary verb (like \"do\") changes places with its subject. It usually happens in questions like \"Are you coming?\". In this example, the subject \"you\" is switched with the verb \"are\". In many other languages, like languages with a freer word order than English, inversion can also happen with more verbs (not just auxiliaries) and other kinds of words."}

People have different ideas about which parts of England are in Northern England, but it usually includes the counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, County Durham, Lancashire, Northumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire, as well as parts of Lincolnshire. There are big cities in Northern England, but there are also large mountains and lakes. The biggest Northern cities are Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sheffield.\nNorthern England has a long history: it was where many battles between England and Scotland were fought, and it was the place where the Industrial Revolution began. Nowadays, most of the industry is gone and Northern England is poorer than Southern England. However, Northern England still has its own culture and way of speaking, and many Northerners are proud of the region.\nArea.\nThe area roughly spans from the River Trent to the Scottish border in the north. However, people disagree about where the southern border is. Some people say Northern England starts near Birmingham, while some people say it only starts at the River Tees. The government says that Northern England is made up of three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331\u00a0km2 (14,414 sq mi). \nGeography.\nNorthern England contains much of England's national parkland but also has large areas of urbanization, including the conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Teesside, Tyneside, Wearside, South and West Yorkshire."}

As of 2017, she is the only woman ever to receive the Medal of Honor.\nEducation and early life.\nShe was born on November 26, 1832. Growing up, she lived in Oswego, New York with her parents, Alvah Walker and Vesta Whitcomb Walker. Her parents taught her to always be driven and stand up for what she believed in. Her parents supported abolitionist groups and women\u2019s rights movements. They believed everyone deserved to be treated equally and with respect no matter their race or gender. She used what she learned from her parents to help her accomplish her goals in life.\nHer education was very important to her and her parents. \u00a0She studied to become a surgeon at Syracuse Medical College and graduated in 1855 with a medical degree. After college she met Albert Miller, also a physician, and they got married in 1856 but she kept her last name as Walker. \u00a0After marriage, together they started a medical practice, but not many people wanted to go to a woman doctor as they did not trust she could do as good of a job as a man physician. The practice struggled and so did the young couples marriage. Thirteen years later Mary Walker and Albert Miller divorced and their practice failed. Although her marriage failed, she came back more confident than ever as the Civil War began.\nCivil War.\nAt the break of the Civil War and with high confidence, Walker tried to enlist in the Union Army. She was denied because of her gender but did not take no for an answer. Trying again, she enlisted as a surgeon in the war and was transferred to the 52nd Ohio Infantry. Later she was appointed assistant surgeon. This was a very big accomplishment for a woman at this time. \u00a0During one of her trips to the Confederacy to tend to the sick and wounded, she was captured. During 1864 Walker was imprisoned for four months in Richmond, Virginia. After four months Walker, along with other surgeons in the Union, were released in a trade for 17 Confederate doctors. Even after her capture, Walker still continued to cross the line between the Confederates and Union to tend to the sick and wounded even after her experience of being imprisoned with the Confederates. Until the war ended, Walker remained with the 52nd Ohio Infantry, tending to the sick and wounded. Mary Edward Walker\u2019s persistence and determination paid off as she served the sick and wounded on the battlefield, refusing to be pulled down because of her gender. \nAfter the War.\nOnce the war had ended, Walker went back home to Oswego, New York. She was honored for her work. On November 11, 1865, she received the Congressional Medal of Honor. She was the first and only woman to ever receive this honor. \u00a0Soon after she got her medal, it was revoked by Congress because she was not involved in combat. \u00a0Walker did not let this get her down. Every single day, until she died, she wore her medal and refused to give it back. Since she almost never wore women\u2019s clothing, she was arrested several times for wearing men\u2019s clothing but never was put in jail. Walker believed that the Constitution gave women a right to vote and wear what they wanted. She died on February 21, 1919, three months before the 19th amendment was passed giving women the right to vote. After her death, she was remembered for her intelligence, bravery, and determination.\nLegacy.\nIn 1977, President Jimmy Carter restored Mary Edwards Walker\u2019s medal. She was smart, kind, and helped change the face of women\u2019s rights to get it to the place it is today. At the time she was doing something that people believed was impossible; a woman becoming a doctor who served on a battlefield. She was different, and proved that it\u2019s ok to take risks and to be bold in your beliefs. In 2012, a large statue of her was made in her hometown. A cargo ship, The SS Mary Walker was named after her in World War II. Multiple medical campuses were named after her and the post office put her on a stamp to honor her."}

Gambling addictions often puts the person in risk of losing everything. People with this illness often think about suicide more than the general population. Many people use gambling as a way to get away from their terrible lives and to gain satisfaction. In many ways, gambling addiction is similar to other addictions (such as the addiction to alcohol or the addiction to illegal drugs).\nSomeone with a gambling addiction often\nGambling addiction is a serious disease difficult to overcome. In most cases, it is treated through therapy and counseling. In some cases, specific drugs can help. There is no definite cure. \nResearch demonstrates how the brain can get addicted to gambling. There is also evidence older people are more likely to become gambling addicts.\nRecently, the problem of gambling has become extremely important due to the ubiquitous distribution of cash slot machines, the opening of many casinos, as well as bookmakers (including online). All of them are beautifully designed, which enhances the suggestive effect of an easy winning opportunity in a short time and a constant desire to recoup and win more. Slot machines have long been widespread throughout the world. \nIn the United States, according to R. Volberg (1996), the number of \u201cproblem players\u201d - addictive gamblers so dependent on slot machines that their lives are completely subordinated to this passion - reaches 5% of the population. Data from other researchers (Ladouceur et al., 1999) indicate that in the first half of the 1990s alone, the number of problem players in Canada increased by more than 75%.\nCovid-19 impacted gambling significantly. 68% of actively engaged gamblers have spent more money online since lockdown began. These frequent online gamblers are already vulnerable to addiction, and their behaviour in 2020 has been seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. But, with 40% of the population experiencing a decrease in their disposable income, it\u2019s possible that infrequent betters might look to online gambling as a quick solution for financial difficulty.

There could have been up to 600 people in the 120 one- and two-bedroom flats of the block at the time of the fire. The number of people that were in the building when the fire broke out is unknown; police have estimated around 200.\nThe fire started around 00:50 BST (UTC+1), when a fridge caught fire in flat 16 on 4th floor. Firefighters arrived around 1am, and put out the fire in the flat within minutes. When the crew were leaving the building, they spotted flames rising up the outside of the building. Images later presented to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry suggested that the fire may have reached the outside before the firefighters had begun to tackle the initial fire in flat 16. The flames spread up the side at a \"terrifying rate\", By 01:29, a rising column of flames had reached the roof and the fire was out of control.\nMany people believe this rapid spread was due to the outside of the building, which had been changed recently. This cladding seemed to contain highly flammable material. Many residents complained about poor fire safety and other problems with the building, which was managed on behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The residents' organisation, Grenfell Action Group, had repeatedly warned of major fire safety problems since 2013, and also noted past fires and fire-related incidents in similar blocks managed by the same company, which they felt were related to poor fire safeguards and management company fire policies. One of these policies told residents to stay in their flats in case of fire. The group warned in November 2016 that only a \"catastrophic\" fire would finally force the block's management to treat fire precautions and maintenance of fire-related systems to a proper standard.\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were \"questions that have to be answered\" about the fire-safety conditions at the Grenfell Tower. Khan criticised the safety instructions telling people to stay in their flats in particular:\n\"We can't have people's lives being put at risk because of bad advice or lack of maintenance.\" The advice of staying in the flat assumes that firefighters can contain the fire inside the building, which is impossible if it is spreading rapidly via its outside. The advice may have proved fatal to many people.\nExtinguishing the fire.\nA team of 250 firefighters from forty fire engines attempted to control the fire and rescue people. The first emergency services arrived six minutes after the alarm, but the fire's very high temperature slowed rescue attempts. At 04:14, officials from the Metropolitan Police addressed the large crowd of onlookers and urgently told them to contact anyone they knew who was trapped in the building\u2014if they are able to reach them via phone or social media\u2014to tell them they must try to self-evacuate and not wait for the fire brigade. Firefighters entered the building to try to rescue people but reported they were hindered by the extreme heat. According to witnesses, there were people trapped inside, waving from windows for help, some holding children. There were two witness accounts of parents dropping their children down to people below, including a baby who was caught after being thrown from the ninth or tenth floor, and a small boy thrown from the fifth or sixth floor. There were also eyewitness reports that some people were jumping out. At least one person used knotted blankets to make a rope and escape from the burning building. Frequent explosions that were reported to be from gas lines in the building were heard.\nMany residents of the tower were Muslims. Because of Ramadan, many were awake at the late hour. Many were able to alert residents and help them escape during the early stages of the fire, which saved many lives. For this, they were hailed as heroes.\nAfter three hours, the original crew of firefighters were replaced. By sunrise, the firefighters were still battling the fire and trying to spray areas where people were seen trapped. The watching crowd were pushed back from the building because of falling debris. At 05:00, the building was still burning and severely damaged. The fire continued to burn on the tower's upper floors into the afternoon of 14 June. Firefighters were expecting to continue tackling the blaze for at least a further 24 hours. Although fears were expressed that the building could collapse, structural engineers determined that it was not in danger and that rescue teams could enter it to search for survivors, casualties and bodies.\nCause.\nThe cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Several media outlets reported that it may have been caused by a faulty kitchen appliance. A fourth-floor resident told the media that it was his neighbour's fridge that caught fire around 1:00\u00a0am, and that they immediately began knocking on doors to alert people. He said that within half an hour the building was entirely engulfed in flames.\nWhilst there was much criticism of the lack of fire sprinkler systems, Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the \"Architects' Journal\", wrote in a comment on 14 June, before the cause was known (\"we should avoid speculating\"), that if a leaking gas riser or the cladding were at fault, sprinklers would have had little effect. He said he had seen extracts of a fire risk assessment and talk of flammable material stored in the common walkways, suggesting poor overall management.\nProblems.\nPoorly maintained.\nThe inhabitants of the building organised the Grenfell Action Group, years ago. They regularly pointed out problems with the building. In 2013, they published part of a report, where they showed that the protection against fire was insufficient in the building. Regulations require that these materials are checked regularly. According to the 2013 report of action group, there had been no such checks in the three years before the report.\nWhen a building is on fire, people need to be able to get out quickly. Usually, there are specially signalled escape lanes for this. The action group pointed out that the escape lanes were not free, and people often parked their cars in such a way that the police was unable to get close to the building.\nThere had been various repairs and renovations in the building, from 2014 to 2016. The company who was responsible for these works said that they were shocked, at what had happened, and that at the time the works had been done, regulations had been met.\nMaterials on the outside of the building may have helped the fire spread.\nWhen the building was renovated, the materials used for the outside of the building were changed. Fire safety experts have speculated that this new material was a possible cause of the rapid spread of the fire. They said it essentially worked like a chimney in spreading the fire. The material could be seen burning and melting, causing additional speculation that it was not fire resistant. One resident said, \"The whole one side of the building was on fire. The cladding went up like a matchstick.\"\nRecords show that a contractor installed \"over-cladding with ACM cassette rain screen\" during the recent refurbishment at Grenfell Tower. The term ACM stands for aluminium composite material. With this kind of material, the choice of insulation core material determines how easily it can be burned. Several tower building fires have involved the same external materials, including the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, London, the 2009 Beijing Television Cultural Center fire and the 2015 fire at The Marina Torch, Dubai. Sam Webb, the architect who investigated the Lakanal fire and who sits on the All Party Parliamentary Fire Safety &amp; Rescue Group, said \"This tragedy was entirely predictable, sadly.\"\nThe product used was Reynobond, which is available with different types of core material\u2014polyethylene, as reportedly used in Grenfell Tower (Reynobond PE), or a more fire-resistant material (Reynobond FR). The Reynobond cladding reportedly cost \u00a324 per square metre for the fireproof versions, and \u00a322 for the flammable version. According to the BBC, the more fire-resistant version (Reynobond FR) is a very new product, and it is unclear whether it was available at the time the building was being clad.\nAccording to the US-based manufacturer of Reynobond, the polyethylene version of the material is banned in the United States for use in buildings exceeding in height, because of the risk of spreading fire and smoke. The refurbishment also used an insulation foam product named Celotex RS5000, installed behind the cladding.\nAccording to its datasheet, the polyisocyanurate product\u2014charred pieces of which littered the area around Grenfell Tower after the fire\u2014\"will burn if exposed to a fire of sufficient heat and intensity\".\nThe cladding at Grenfell seems to have been used to decorate other apartment blocks. People are concerned that the affected buildings may face the same problems.\nSome residents had reported concern that the new cladding on the building was fixed onto it with wooden battens. There is widespread concern amongst residents and fire safety experts about the increasing use of timber, even in high-rise buildings, following a change to building regulations. It was reported that one reason for the new cladding was to improve the view for people living in the surrounding area.\nAutomatic fire alarm system may have failed.\nSome residents said no fire alarms went off when the fire started. Residents said they were alerted to the fire only by people screaming for help or knocks on the door and not by a fire alarm. Others reported that they survived by ignoring the council's \"stay put\" policy, its directive instructing residents to remain in their flat in case of fire.\nThe London-wide Radical Housing Network, a citizens' action \"group of groups... fighting for housing justice across London\" of which the Grenfell Action Group is a member, said that the fire was \"a horrific, preventable tragedy\" that was the result of a \"combination of government cuts, local authority mismanagement, and sheer contempt for council tenants and the homes they live in\".\nCommunity response.\nPeople in the immediate area and from across London rallied to assist victims of the fire. Donations of food, water, toys, and clothes were made. Saint Clement Church on Treadgold Street and St James' Church, Norlands, in the Deanery of Kensington, provided shelter for people evacuated from their homes, as did nearby mosques and temples.\nNearby Queens Park Rangers Football Club have offered their Loftus Road venue as a relief centre and are accepting donations of food, drink and clothing from the local community, and other nearby football clubs Brentford and Fulham have offered their stadiums as relief centres."}

He also negotiated the marriage of princess Margaret of Valois, who was five years old at the time, with prince Sebastian of Portugal, who was six years old at the time.\nWhen Nicot returned, he brought tobacco plants. He introduced snuff tobacco to the French royal court. In particular, he presented the queen mother, Catherine de' Medici, with tobacco leaves to cure her of her migraines. The plant was also an instant success with the Father Superior of Malta, who shared tobacco with all of his monks. More and more of the fashionable people of Paris began to use the plant, making Nicot a celebrity.At first, the plant was called Nicotina. But nicotine later came to refer specifically to the particular chemical in the plant. The tobacco plant, \"Nicotiana\", also a flowering garden plant, was named after him by Carl Linnaeus, as was nicotine. Nicot described its believed medicinal properties (1559) and sent it as a medicine to the French court.For his service to the French royal court, Nicot was given the name 'de Villemain' and land near Brie-Comte-Robert. There, he compiled one of the first French dictionaries, \"Thresor de la langue fran\u00e7oyse tant ancienne que moderne\" (published in 1606)."}

{"id": "588179", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588179", "title": "Polyisocyanurate", "text": "Polyisocyanurate is a thermoset plastic. It is also called PIR, polyiso, or ISO. It is usually made as a foam. It is used as rigid thermal insulation. It is similar to polyurethane (PUR) except that the proportion of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is higher and a polyester-derived polyol is used in the reaction instead of a polyether polyol. Catalysts and additives used in PIR is also different from those used in PUR.\nUses.\nPIR is used in rigid thermal insulation. PIR foam panels laminated with pure embossed aluminium foil are used in making of pre-insulated duct that is used for heating, ventilation and in air conditioning systems. Prefabricated PIR sandwich panels are manufactured with corrosion-protected, corrugated steel facings bonded to a core of PIR foam and used extensively as roofing insulation and vertical walls (e.g. for warehousing, factories, office buildings etc.). Other typical uses for PIR foams include industrial and commercial pipe insulation, and carving/machining media (competing with expanded polystyrene and rigid polyurethane foams).\nEffectiveness of the insulation of a building envelope can be compromised by gaps resulting from shrinkage of individual panels. Manufacturing criteria require that shrinkage be limited to less than 1% (previously 2%). Even when shrinkage is limited to substantially less than this limit, the resulting gaps around the perimeter of each panel can reduce insulation effectiveness, especially if the panels are assumed to provide a vapor/infiltration barrier. Multiple layers with staggered joints, ship lapped or tongue &amp; groove joints greatly reduce these problems.\nHealth hazards.\nPIR insulation can be a mechanical irritant to skin, eyes, and upper respiratory system during fabrication (such as dust). No statistically significant increased risks of respiratory diseases have been found in studies\nFire risk.\nPIR is at times stated to be fire retardant, or contain fire retardants, however these describe the results of \"small scale tests\" and \"do not reflect [all] hazards under real fire conditions\"; the extent of hazards from fire include not just resistance to fire but the scope for toxic byproducts from different fire scenarios. A 2011 study of fire toxicity of insulating materials at the University of Central Lancashire's Centre for Fire and Hazard Science studied PIR and other commonly used materials under more realistic and wide-ranging conditions representative of a wider range of fire hazard, observing that most fire deaths resulted from toxic product inhalation. The study evaluated the degree to which toxic products were released, looking at toxicity, time-release profiles, and lethality of doses released, in a range of flaming, non-flaming, and poorly ventilated fires, and concluded that PIR generally released a considerably higher level of toxic products than the other insulating materials studied (PIR &gt; PUR &gt; EPS &gt; PHF; glass and stone wools also studied). In particular, hydrogen cyanide is recognised as a significant contributor to the fire toxicity of PIR (and PUR) foams.\nDespite this PIR insulation is generally regarded as being more fire resistant than PUR insulation.\n100mm PIR insulation board (cited as the RS5000 product of Celotex, a Saint-Gobain company) was proposed as the columnar and horizontal external insulation to be used in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, London; subsequently \"Ipswich firm Celotex confirmed it provided insulation materials for the refurbishment.\" On 14 June 2017 the block of flats, within 15 minutes, was enveloped in flames from the fourth floor to the top 24th floor. The causes of the rapid spread of fire up the outside of the building have yet to be established. It should be noted that flames can occupy the cavity between the insulation material and the cladding, and be drawn upwards by convection, elongating to create secondary fires, and do so \"regardless of the materials used to line the cavities\"."}

A group of leaders called the Board of Regents created it. They were from Brigham Young University.\nBrigham Young wanted all letters to match sounds, to make reading and writing easier for immigrants. Teachers taught the alphabet in the school system at the time. \nBetween 1854 and 1869, books, newspapers, street signs and mail used the new alphabet. Even though the LDS church tried very hard to support the alphabet, it wasn't continued for very long.\nHistory.\nCreation (1847\u20131854).\nChurch leaders Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt and Heber C. Kimball were part of the Board of Regents that made the Deseret alphabet. Other important creators were George D. Watt and William W. Phelps.\nBefore they decided to use the Deseret alphabet, the Board of Regents thought they would use Pitman style alphabets. On 29 November 1853, they came together to vote. Then, Willard Richards, who was sick when the Board of Regents had talked about which alphabet to use, saw the Pitman style alphabet. He said it looked too much like the English alphabet, and he wanted to start over with something new. His words convinced Brigham Young and the rest of the Board of Regents to make the Deseret alphabet. Less than two months later, the Board of Regents approved the first 38-letter Deseret alphabet. \nAlphabet.\nIn the Deseret alphabet, capital letters (\"majuscule\" or upper case) look the same as the lower case (\"minuscule\") letters, except the capital letters are larger. In the chart below, the \"Glyph\" is the letter shape, and next to it is the letter's name, which is how it sounds."}

It is one of the largest administrative, industrial and cultural centers of southern Ukraine with advanced engineering, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, chemical and construction industries, a river port and an important transit railway junction. \nAccording to the Consolidated Scheme of District Planning of Ukraine, Zaporizhia occupies an important place in the regional settlement system and performs the functions of regional, international and district centers, each of which has its own zone of inter-village service. \nThus, in the zone of influence of Zaporizhia as a regional center on the territory of 2690 thousand hectares there are 14 cities, 23 urban-type settlements, a significant number of villages and more than 2 million people live. The inter-district settlement system headed by Zaporizhia (suburban zone) is characterized by a high level of industrial and economic mastery of the territory, high value of agricultural lands and pago environment.

He chose A.J. Styles, Shinsuke Nakamura, Dolph Ziggler, Sami Zayn and Baron Corbin. But Kevin Owens was upset by this because he beat A.J. at Backlash and if A.J. is in the match, he should be too.

It resulted in an Italian occupation of nearly 1/4 of the French Somaliland territory from summer 1940 until spring 1941. \nHistory.\nIn summer 1940 the Italians occupied the western areas of French Somaliland, while attacking southern France. The armistice stopped their advance. In early 1941 they withdrew from the areas occupied, because of the British attacks on Italian East Africa (Eritrea, Somalia &amp; Ethiopia).\nThe 1940 invasion.\nIn June 1940 and until September 1940 the Italians did a series of attacks in Africa: one was in the \"Cote Francaise des Somalis\" (now called Djibouti). \nIn June 1940 the French commander in Djibouti, Brigadier-General Paul Legentilhomme, had nearly 9,000 men in seven battalions of Senegalese and Somali infantry. Legentilhomme also had three batteries of field guns, four batteries of anti-aircraft guns, a company of 16 light Renault R35 tanks, four companies of militia and irregulars, two platoons of camel corps, and an assortment of 18 aircraft. \nThe Italians had on the eastern border of their Italian Ethiopia -under the \"Commander\" General Guglielmo Nasi and with the support of the \"Regia Aeronautica\"- nearly 40,000 soldiers: the 40th Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa of General Giovanni Varda, the 65th Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia of general Amedeo Liberati and 6 colonial brigades supported by 4 tank companies (mainly Fiat L3/35 tankettes) and by one Armored Car Company with Fiat 611 \"autoblindo\". \nBut only the Italian colonial troops (the brigades were made mainly of Eritrean Ascari) fought inside the French Somaliland, while the division \"Cacciatori D'Africa\" only entered southern coastal French Somalia during the August attack on British Zeila.\nAfter Italy's declaration of war on France and Great Britain on June 10, there were in the following week some skirmishing between the French and Italians around the railroad connecting Addis Ababa to Djibouti: the nearby French fort of Ali-Sabieh was hit by Italian colonial troops. \n \nThe invasion was started from Italian Ethiopia's Harrar Governorate, when colonial troops of general Guglielmo Nasi attacked the fort of Ali-Sabieh in the south and Daddato in the north. After some days of heavy fighting the french garrisons surrendered to the Italian colonial troops. There were initial skirmishes even in the area of Dagguirou and around the lakes Abhe &amp; Ally. \nAfter the first week the Italian aviation started to attack: on 17 June some Italian IMAM Ro.37 aircraft undertook a reconnaissance of Djibouti, noting five or six warships in the port and about twenty aircraft at a nearby aerodrome. On 21 June eleven Caproni Ca.133s bombed Djibouti in the largest raid of the colony's brief war. Anti-aircraft fire was intense and two Italian aircraft failed to return, but fires and explosions were seen in Djibouti.\nOvernight, several waves of Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers attacked the port facilities. On 22 June the Italians suspected the British might try to establish a forward base at Djibouti, and five Ro.37bis, four Fiat CR.42 and one Fiat CR.32 aircraft hit the airfield there. Some French Potez 25 reconnaissance aircraft bombed Italian installations at Dewele in retaliation.\nThe invasion was also done inside the \"Territorial waters\" of French Somaliland in the gulf of Tadjoura. Since the first week the Italian Navy sent two submarines (\"Torricelli\" &amp; \"Perla\") to patrol the waters in front of Djibouti city, Tadjoura and Oblock.\nThe Armistice of Villa Incisa (previously written on June 24) requested officially on June 25 the \"forced demilitarisation of Gibuti\", according to articles 3, 5 and 9.\nFinally between 1 and 10 July 1940 several clashes with the Italians took place again on the plain of Hanl\u00e9, at Ali-Sabieh and along the railroad. The border area of western French Somalia was occupied by Italian troops, who withdrew from Hanl\u00e9 in October 1940 and only in March 1941 from Dagguirou.\nSince July the Italians occupied nearly 1/4 of French Somaliland, but it was nearly all a semi-desert and depopulated region. Meanwhile, as a consequence of the problems about Legentilhomme withdrawal, the Italians reinforced their garrisons in Hanl\u00e9 and Daggirou (also with the construction of a new road from Italian Eritrea). \nWhen Italian troops attacked British Somaliland in August 1940, they occupied the southern coast of the \"Cote Francaise des Somalis\": the 17th Colonial Brigade under Colonel Agosti occupied the French fort at Loyada on the border with British Somaliland. Later, when the Italian invasion of British Somaliland began on 3 August, the forces at Loyada moved on Zeila, which they conquered by 5 August.\nDagguirou (and all northern French Somaliland bordering Italian Eritrea) remained under Italian control until March 1941."}

Relaxin adjusts blood supply during pregnancy. It also relaxes pelvic ligaments. It softens the pubic symphysis (the ligaments joining the bottom of the pelvis).\nIn males, relaxin also has a function: it enhances motility of sperm in semen.\nIn other animals.\nIn animals, relaxin widens the pubic bone and facilitates labor. It also softens the cervix (cervical ripening), and relaxes the uterine musculature. Thus, for a long time, relaxin was looked at as a pregnancy hormone. However, its significance may reach much further. Relaxin affects collagen metabolism, inhibiting collagen synthesis and enhancing its breakdown. "}

The word comes from Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 (\"paradeigma\"), \"pattern, example, sample\" from the verb \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9 (\"paradeiknumi\"), \"exhibit, represent, expose\" and that from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac (\"para\"), \"beside, beyond\" and \u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9 (\"deiknumi\"), \"to show, to point out\". Paradigm can also be used to refer to a set of ideas about a given subject. The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe, or that the Earth and other planets move around the sun are examples of paradigms. One of the first modern people to use the word was Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799), an 18th century mathematician and scientist.\nIn rhetoric, paradeigma is known as a type of proof. The purpose of paradeigma is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences. This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion, however it is used to help guide them there. A personal accountant is a good comparison of paradeigma to explain how it is meant to guide the audience. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what (and what not) to spend their money on, but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals. Anaximenes defined paradeigma as, \"actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing.\" Aristotle uses the word in a similar way, in inductive logic. usually, induction is used to get from a number of special cases to a general one. Aristotle uses the word to get from one special case to another.\nThe original Greek term \"\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\" (paradeigma) was used in Greek texts such as Plato's Timaeus (28A) as the model or the pattern that the Demiurge (god) used to create the cosmos. The term had a technical meaning in the field of grammar: the 1900 \"Merriam-Webster\" dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or, in rhetoric, as a term for an illustrative parable or fable. In linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure used \"paradigm\" to refer to a class of elements with similarities."}

It is not a normal use for teeth like eating or talking. Bruxism is a common problem that affects 8\u201331% of people. Bruxism can wear down teeth, make them too sensitive, and cause headaches and jaw pain. It can also harm dental work like crowns and fillings. Sometimes these problems are not noticed, so not everyone with bruxism knows they have it.\nThere are two main kinds of bruxism: sleep bruxism and awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism happens when the person sleeps, and awake bruxism happens when the person is awake. Symptoms of sleep bruxism are often worse when waking up. Awake bruxism can feel fine when waking up, then get worse as the day goes on. There may be many reasons why people grind their teeth and clench their jaws. Awake bruxism may have different causes from sleep bruxism. Females are more likely to have awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism affects males as often as females. Several treatments are used, but none are proved to be very effective."}

The numerical value of formula_1 is about formula_3.

For example, many \"natural\" plants and animals are poisonous, but unnatural things like medicine and vaccines can be helpful against diseases. \nExamples.\nSome popular examples of the appeal to nature can be found on labels and advertisements for food, clothing, and health products.

These electronics send signals to the device implanted in the ear to make hearing possible.\nMost cochlear implants have the following parts. They are divided into external parts which can be seen outside and internal parts which are implanted:\nInternal.\nImplanting the device requires proper care and skill. The person on which the device will be implanted will be anesthetized. There are risks, a person may experience mastoiditis or otitis media, the facial nerve or chorda tympani maybe damaged and the implanted device could shift. Wound infections may also occur. After the implant, people may become dizzy and have problems balancing for a few months.\nThe total cost of a cochlear implant in the United States was about $100,000 in 2017. Health insurance sometimes pays for all or part of the cost of cochlear implants. The national health insurance schemes in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, Spain, and Israel pay fully for the costs of cochlear implants.

It controls the amount of money supply in the economy in order to ensure the economy and prices are stable. The Currency &amp; Branch Operations Department of the CBN is in charge of currency management. They get the naira notes and coins from its special printers. Then they distribute/supply, process, and reissue it. They also receive and destroy old and unusable bank notes and coins.\nHistory.\nNigeria started using the naira on 1 January 1973, replacing the pound at a rate of 2 naira = 1 pound. The currency sign is \u20a6. In October 2021, the eNaira, the digital version of the state currency, is officially launched in Nigeria.\nCoins.\nIn 1973, coins were introduced in denominations of \u00bd, 1, 5, 10 and 25 kobo, with the \u00bd and 1 kobo in bronze and the higher denominations in cupro-nickel. The \u00bd kobo coins were minted only that year. In 1991, smaller 1, 10 and 25 kobo coins were issued in copper-plated-steel, along with nickel-plated-steel 50 kobo and 1 naira. On 28 February 2007, new coins were issued in denominations of 50 kobo, 1 and 2 naira, with the 1 and 2 naira bimetallic. Some Nigerians complained that the weight of the \u20a62 coin especially how heavy it is when there is a lot of it . The CBN announced that the old coins are to be replaced with the new ones on or before 31 May 2007. The central bank also stated that the \u00bd to 25 kobo coins withdrew withdrawn from circulation with from 28 February 2007.\nBanknotes.\nOn January 1, 1973, the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced notes for 50 kobo, 1, 5, 10 and 20 naira. The 50 kobo notes were last issued in 1989. In 1991, 50 naira notes were issued, followed by 100 naira in 1999, 200 naira in 2000, 500 naira in 2001 and 1000 naira on October 12, 2005.\nOn February 28, 2007, new designs of the 5 to 50 naira banknotes were introduced. Originally the 10, 20 and 50 naira were to be polymer banknotes, but the 5,10 and 50 were delayed to late 2009 and only the 20 was released in polymer. The notes are slightly smaller (130 x 23\u00a0mm) and redesigned from the preceding issues. In mid-2009 when Sanusi Lamido Sanusi took over as CBN Governor he eventually changed the 5, 10 and 50 naira to polymer notes.\nOn the 1000 naira notes, there is a subtle shiny strip running down the back of the note. It is a shimmery gold colour showing 1000 naira. The triangular shape in the middle of the front of the note changes its colour from green to blue when tilted. The main feature on the front is the engraved portraits of Alhaji Aliyu Mai-Bornu and Dr Clement Isong, former governors of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\nOn the first prints of the 100 naira notes issued starting December 1, 1999, Zuma Rock was captioned as located in Federal Capital Territory, while actually it is in Niger State. Later prints removed the reference to FCT, ABUJA.\nIn 2012 the Central Bank of Nigeria may be contemplating the introduction of new currency denominations of N5,000. The bank has also made plans to convert \u20a65, \u20a610, \u20a620 and \u20a650 into coins which are all presently notes.\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has announced that it will no longer issue banknotes on polymer due to higher costs and environmental issues.\nOn November 12, 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a special 100 naira note to celebrate the 100 years of Nigeria's existence. The notes are similar to its regular ones with the portrait of Chief Obafemi Awolowo on front, but is redesigned to include a new color style. It has the text \"One Nigeria, Great Promise\" in microprinting and a quickresponse code (QRC) which when scanned leads users to a website about Nigeria's history on the back."}

It is located within the Murmansk Oblast. As of 2019, the city has a population of 292,465 people.\nHistory.\nThe first Murmansk settlement was founded in 1915. It was founded during World War I so Russia's allies could send supplies to a port that wasn't blocked by ice. The location soon had a naval base and port. The settlement became an official city in 1916, and was named Romanov-on-Murman (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432-\u043d\u0430-\u041c\u0443\u0301\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435, Romanov-na-Murmane). The city was given it's current name on 16 April 1917.\nFrom 1918 to 1920, during the Russian Civil War, the city was occupied by the White army and the Triple Entente.\nDuring World War II, the city was an important link to the Western world for the Soviet Union. They traded supplies during the war. In 1941, the German and Finnish forces launched Operation Silver Fox with the goal of capturing Murmansk. The Soviets defeated the invaders, but Murmansk suffered a lot of destruction.\nMurmansk is headquarters of the Northern Fleet of the Russian Navy. During the Cold War it was a center for Soviet submarine activity.\nIn 1974, a large 36 meter (118 feet) tall monument was built in the city. It is called the Alyosha Monument. It was built in remembrance of all who fought for Murmansk in World War II. On 6 May 1985, Murmansk was formally called a Hero City (which is a title awarded to cities in the Soviet Union that performed outstanding heroism during WW2).\nThe Arctic Hotel opened in 1984, and became the tallest building above the Arctic Circle.\nEconomy.\nThe main industries in Murmansk are fishing, sea transport, rail and road transportation, marine geology, etc.\nDemographics.\nThe city's population has been shrinking since 1992. At it's peak, the city had a population of around 489,000 people in 1989. Between 1989 and 1992, more than 28,000 people left the city. This was because of the sudden deterioration in the economic situation.\nAccording to the 2010 census, the ethnic composition is:\nIn 2016, 16.5% of the population was under 15 years of age, while 54.7% was between 16 and 56, and 28.7% of the population was older than 56. This means that the city has a older population compared to the entire Murmansk Oblast.\nClimate.\nMurmansk has a subarctic climate. This means that the city has long and cold winters and short, cool summers. Murmansk is above the arctic circle, so the city experiences polar nights."}

The oldest parts were built in the late 11th century. Most parts of the building are from around 1250 to 1320. In 2015 it was proposed as a World Heritage Site. \nIt has been a museum of local Jewish history since 2009. The Erfurt Treasure is kept there. This is a collection of medieval coins, jewellery and metalwork found in 1998. The museum also has copies of the Erfurt Hebrew Manuscripts. This is a collection of rare religious manuscripts that belonged to the Jewish community of Erfurt in the middle ages.\nHistory and preservation.\nThe oldest parts of the building date from 1094. About 1270 a larger synagogue, which included parts of the older building, was built. The western wall of the building dates from this time. It has its six original windows. Another storey was added in the early 1300s.\nIn 1349, many people died from the Black Death disease. People said it was the fault of the Jews. The Jews were murdered and made to leave the city. This pogrom is known as the Erfurt Massacre. The synagogue was damaged and Erfurt City Council took control of the building. They later sold it to a local business man. He used it as a warehouse and made changes to the interior, including building a cellar. For the next 500 years it was used for storing goods. \nFrom the 19th century, the building was used as a ballroom, a restaurant and even a bowling alley. These changes meant that the Old Synagogue was mostly forgotten about. Its history was not recognised, which helped to protect it during the Nazi period.\nIn the late 1980s there was renewed interest in the old building. The architectural historian Elmar Altwasser began to research it in 1992. Erfurt City Council bought the property in 1998 and researched and conserved it. All stages of the building's history were conserved, not just its use as a Synagogue.\nIn 2007 a rare and well-preserved Jewish ritual bath, a Mikveh, was discovered not far from the Old Synagogue by archaeologists. It was built about 1250.\nIn 2015 the Old Synagogue and Mikveh, and a stone house in Erfurt's medieval city centre, also built around 1250 that had belonged to Jews, were proposed as a World Heritage Site. This has been provisionally listed but no final decision has been made.\nMuseum.\nThe Old Synagogue opened as a museum on 27 October 2009.\nThe Erfurt Treasure is displayed in the museum. This is a collection of coins, jewellery and metalwork that is thought to have belonged to Jews who hid them at the time of the Erfurt massacre in 1349. It was found in 1998 in the wall of a house in a medieval Jewish neighbourhood in Erfurt. \nThe museum also displays copies of the Erfurt Hebrew Manuscripts. This is a collection medieval manuscripts written from the 12th to the 14th centuries. They came into the possession of the Erfurt City Council after the Erfurt Massacre in 1349. They were kept at the library at St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt from the mid 17th century. In 1880 they were sold to the Royal Library in Berlin, which is now the Berlin State Library. The original manuscripts are kept there.\nErfurt Tosefta.\nOne of the Erfurt Manuscripts is the Tosefta, dating from the 12th century. The Tosefta is a collection of ancient jewish oral laws collected by scholars in the first 200 years AD. Copies of Tosefta were not made very often. The Erfurt Tosefta is the oldest of only three known Tosefta manuscripts. It was written in the 12th century. The other two Tosefta manuscripts are the Vienna Tosefta, made in the late 13th century, held by the Austrian National Library and the London Tosefta, made in 15th century, held by the British Library.\nMoses Samuel Zuckermandel was the first person to point out the importance of the Erfurt Tosefta. He published an important study on it in 1876."}

This number is usually written on the side of light bulb's box. The CRI number can be as high as 100, or as low as zero; and sometimes it can go under zero. High CRI number is good; it means colors will look right and real. Low CRI number is bad; it means colors will look wrong and weird.\nHowever, there is a limit of what a CRI number can tell. Good CRI number can guarantee correct colors only when the light itself is white. This is because of limits on how science people test them. Candles and incandescent light bulbs have CRI 100 but they are not white, so we cannot rely on them to make stuffs show real colors.\nThe CRI number of daylight at noon is 100, because this is the natural way people see colors. Good fluorescent tubes or LED lamps have a CRI 80 or more. Anything white with a CRI 80 or more are good enough for homes. The orange sodium vapor lamp has CRI lower than 0, so they are only used as streetlamps."}

It is a collection of modest shrines, of which the one dedicated to Skanda-Kumara, is the most important.\nIt has been considered hallowed ground since almost three hundred years before the birth of Christ, and is one of the sixteen places said to have been consecrated by Gautama Buddha as he meditated. It was built approximately between 1100 - 15th century \nLegend has it that this happened during the Buddha's third visit to Sri Lanka, during the reign of the provincial King Mahasena in the sixth century BC.\nKataragama is sacred to Lord Murugan, also familiarly known as Kartikeya. Lord Muruga has many shrines and places of worship. Among them are Alaivai, now known as Tiruchendur, a shrine on the southern coast of India about 36 miles from Tinnevelly; Avinankudi, now called as Palani Malai (Palani Hills), about the same distance from Dindigul; and Tiru-Erakam, now known as Swamimalai, a hill about four miles from Kumbakonam. Three of the shrines are situated amid mountains and forests, the deity is known as the God of the mountaneous regions.\nMuruga is worshipped as a deity whom embodies the pure Hindu ideal of God being in all things and manifesting himself wherever he is called to with love.There are many stories about Murugan, or Skanda-Kumara as He is more commonly known there. Skanda-Kumara's place of worship is held dear by many Sri Lankans who consider the Kataragama complex and its temples holy and make annual pilgrimages there.\nBut perhaps the most unique feature of Kataragama, and what makes it really stand out is its relative unassumingness. Almost all its shrines are unremarkable minor buildings free of any embellishment. There is absolutely no representation of deities decorating the exterior of the buildings.\nThis is in marked contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India, that are usually covered with carvings and statues of gods and goddesses in colourful scene. Practically all the shrines are made out of stone with the exception of one dedicated to the Goddess Valli which has been constructed with timber.\nAlmost 2500 years later, Kataragama still holds a special place in the heart of devotees of Lord Muruga"}

The postcode area is the largest geographical unit used and forms the first characters of the alphanumeric UK postcode.\nSubdivision.\nEach postcode area is divided into post towns and postcode districts. The London post town is instead divided into several postcode areas.\nScope.\nThe single or pair of letters chosen for postcode areas are generally a mnemonic for the places served.\nCrown dependencies.\nThe Crown dependencies (which are not part of the United Kingdom) did not introduce postcodes until later, but use a similar coding scheme. They are separate postal authorities.\nDefunct postcode areas.\nGlasgow.\nGlasgow, like London, was divided into compass districts: C, W, NW, N, E, SE, S, SW. When postcodes were introduced, these were mapped into the new \"G\" postcode: C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. As NW and SE had never been subdivided they became G20 and G40 respectively.\nNorwich and Croydon.\nNorwich and Croydon were used for a postcode experiment in the late 1960s, which was replaced by the current system. The format was of the form NOR or CRO followed by two numbers and a letter, e.g. NOR 07A.\nNon-geographic postcodes.\nGIR.\nGIR 0AA is a postcode created for Girobank in Bootle.\nBF.\nThe BF postcode area was introduced in 2012 to provide optional postcodes for British Forces Post Office addresses, for consistency with the layout of other UK addresses. It uses the national non-geographic post town \"BFPO\" and, as of 2012, the postcode district \"BF1\".\nBX.\nThe non-geographic postcode area BX has been introduced for addresses which do not include a locality: this allows large organisations flexibility as to where they receive their mail.\nOverseas territories.\nCertain British overseas territories have postcodes:\nThese were introduced to prevent mail being sent to the wrong place, e.g., for St Helena to St Helens, Merseyside and Ascension Island to Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, and many on-line companies will not accept addresses lacking a postcode. Such mail is treated as international, not inland, so sufficient postage must be used."}

When kanji, or Chinese characters used to write Japanese, first came to Japan in around the 4th century AD through the Korean Peninsula, it was only used to write the Chinese language. Even though Chinese was not native to the Japanese people, classical Chinese writings were nonetheless studied heavily by upper-class Japanese. Some time later, although the exact time is unknown, Chinese characters, which came be known as kanji in Japan, was being used to write the Japanese language for the first time in roughly the 6th century AD, although it had a heavy Chinese influence.\nFiguring out how to write the Chinese character system to correctly fit the Japanese language was quite a difficult task, since there were such big differences between Chinese and Japanese. For example, Chinese has an SVO (subject-verb-object) word order (i.e. I eat sushi), while Japanese has an SOV word order (i.e. I sushi eat). Also, while Chinese morphemes, or the smallest meaningful part of a word, are usually monosyllabic, or having just one syllable, Japanese words often were polysyllabic, or having two or more syllables. Examples of this include \u5c71, \u9b5a, \u4e2d, \u56fd, \u4eba, \u591a, \u901f and \u898b. In Mandarin Chinese, the most spoken Chinese dialect in the world, these morphemes are pronounced \"sh\u0101n, y\u00fa, zh\u014dng,\" \"gu\u00f3, r\u00e9n, du\u014d, s\u00f9\" and \"k\u00e0n\" in that order, all of which are just one syllable. In the native Japanese pronunciation, however, these morphemes are pronounced \"yama, sakana, naka, kuni, hito, oo, haya\" and \"mi(ru)\". What makes all this more complicated is that the last three kanji are almost never written by themselves in Japanese, if at all, since they are usually used in adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. \nWriting characters by themselves is often okay in Chinese, since Chinese is an analytic language, or a language where grammar is structured by word order, but Japanese is highly inflectional, meaning that grammar is structured by word endings. For that reason, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs almost always have at least two morphemes, the first being the derivational morpheme, or the part of the word with the root meaning, and the second and others after it are called inflectional morphemes, or parts of the word added to show a word's grammar. For example, a word that uses the character \u898b is \u898b\u308b \"mi(ru),\" where the first morpheme, the kanji being \u898b and its pronunciation being \"mi,\" has the root meaning \"\"see\",\" the second syllable \"ru\" shows that the word is a verb, making it into the word \"\"to see\".\" The adjective \u591a\u3044 \"oo(i)\" is made up of the morpheme \u591a \"oo\", meaning \"many\", and the morpheme \u3044 \"i,\" showing that the word is an adjective. The last examples are the two words \u901f\u3044 \"haya(i)\" and \u901f\u304f \"haya(ku).\" While the first morpheme in both words are the two syllables \u901f \"haya,\" meaning \"\"fast\",\" the \u3044 \"i\u3000\"in \u901f\u3044 makes the word into an adjective while the \u304f \"ku\" in \u901f\u304f \"hayaku\" turns the word into an adverb, thus the word becomes \"quickly\".\nDue to the many differences that existed between Chinese and Japanese, the Chinese character system had to be changed to fit spoken Japanese, if it were to be understood by native Japanese speakers. The first solution the Japanese came up with was to use Chinese characters for their pronunciation and not for the meaning of the word. These were called man'y\u014dgana, which was named after the Man'y\u014dshu, a collection of Japanese poems that wrote Japanese using the man'y\u014dgana. While Chinese characters used for their meaning became known as kanji, the Chinese characters being used only for pronunciation became known as man'y\u014dgana. Man'y\u014dgana consisted of roughly 970 Chinese characters that could be used to represent roughly the roughly 90 different morae used in the Japanese language. \nFor example, while the character \u5c71 means \"mountain\" in Japanese, the character itself was usually used only for Chinese loanwords, or words borrowed from the Chinese language, such as \u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \"Fuji-san\", meaning \"\"Mt. Fuji\u201d\uff0c\"\u706b\u5c71\"kazan,\" meaning \"\"volcano\u201d\uff0c\"and \u5c71\u6751 \"sanson\", meaning \"\"mountain village\".\" Words borrowed from the Chinese language would use on'yomi (in Japanese, the on'yomi for \u3084\u307e is \"san\", \"zan, sen,\" or \"zen\"), or pronunciations borrowed from Chinese, instead of kun'yomi, or native Japanese pronunciations. During the early days of Japanese writing, native Japanese words were largely written using man'y\u014dgana instead of kanji. For example, while the kanji for \"mountain\" is \u5c71, and the kun'yomi for the word is \"yama\", the native Japanese word would be written as \u8036\u9ebb, \u516b\u99ac, \u77e2\u9593, \u4e5f\u9ebb, etc. to distinguish it from being a Chinese loanword, or \"kango\".\nWhile a modern Japanese sentence could be written like this: \u79c1\u306f\u3059\u3057\u3092\u98df\u3079\u307e\u3059 \"Watashi-wa sushi-o tabemasu\" (meaning: I eat sushi), the same sentence written entirely in man'y\u014dgana could be written as \u548c\u591a\u6c0f\u5df4\u5bff\u53f8\u9ce5\u4ed6\u908a\u9ebb\u9808, giving it a more Chinese look. Or, if someone wanted to keep all the kanji the same but replace all the modern kana, the sentence would look like this \u79c1\u5df4\u5bff\u53f8\u9ce5\u98df\u908a\u9ebb\u9808.\nAlthough man'y\u014dgana gave the Japanese a means to represent spoken Japanese on paper, sentences written in man'y\u014dgana were quite difficult to read. Since Chinese characters were used for both representing the meaning of words and pronunciation, a lot of confusion could happen when a native Japanese speaker would read something written in both kanji and man'y\u014dgana. The above examples in man'y\u014dgana would be difficult for even a native Japanese speaker to read, especially for a modern Japanese person. On top of all that, writing everything down quickly was nearly impossible, since an entire Chinese character was needed to write down a simple Japanese syllable, some of which could have been written by up to 30 strokes of a pen.\nIn order to write faster, use fewer written characters, and read more easily, Japanese writers created simpler kana, or written characters to represent Japanese syllables. Buddhist monks created katakana by only using pieces of kanji so that they could write down spoken teachings more quickly. Upper-class women would use the kanji they knew and wrote cursive forms of these kanji. These became known as hiragana. While they were created separately, they later replaced man'y\u014dgana as the main sound-based writing systems. While most sound-based writing today uses hiragana and katakana, man'y\u014dgana is still used to write some modern Japanese words. \nThese examples are called ateji. Some examples include \u5bff\u53f8 sushi, \u4e9c\u7d30\u4e9c \"Ajia\" (Asia)\u3001\u4e9c\u7c73\u5229\u52a0 \"Amerika\" (America)\u3001\u4ecf\u862d\u897f \"Furansu\" (France)\u3001\u963f\u5f17\u5229\u52a0 \"Afurika\" (Africa)\u3001\u6ca2\u5c71 \"takusan\" and \u73c8\u7432 \"k\u014dh\u012b\" (coffee)\u3002\nSometimes, like in the case of \u4ecf\u862d\u897f, these are the old spellings of the names of places before the Japanese decided to represent all non-Chinese loanwords with katanana. Other times, the ateji is used since the Chinese characters are more well-known in different countries than the hiragana and the katana, an example being that the Chinese can recognize \u5bff\u53f8, since both characters also exist in Chinese, rather than \u3059\u3057, since neither character exists in Chinese. While the Chinese characters for \"coffee\" is \u5496\u5561, the Japanese \u73c8\u7432 is close enough that Chinese could figure it out with a little guesswork."}
