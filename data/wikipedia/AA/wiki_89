The ruling dynasty was a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon.\nThe capital of the kingdom was Naples. Roman Catholicism was the state religion. The kingdom was full of corruption and poverty: mainly because of this, most of the population welcomed the Risorgimento with the unification of southern Italy to the rest of Italy in 1861.\nIn 1861, Giuseppe Garibaldi and his men, who were known as \"red shirts\", captured Sicily. This was welcomed by the local population. Garibaldi then crossed the Strait of Messina and captured Naples. South Italy and Sicily then joined the Kingdom of Italy.\nAdministrative division.\nThe peninsula was divided into fifteen \"departments\" and the island of Sicily was divided into seven departments. The island itself had a special administrative status, with its base at Palermo.\nAfter the Two Sicilies were conquered by Garibaldi, the departments became provinces of Italy.\nRoyal family.\nFor a time the heir to the throne was given the title of \"Hereditary Prince of Naples\". But this was later changed to the Duke of Calabria after the uniting of the two kingdoms. Collectively the royal family generally lived at the Palace of Caserta. Children of the monarch were born with the style of \"Royal Highness\" as well as the title of Prince/ss of the Two Sicilies. Several males in the family were given titles such as \"Duke of Castro\", \"Count of Caserta\", \"Prince of Salerno\", a majority of which were lost due to a lack of male heirs. The present pretending monarch is Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria, who does use the title of Duke of Calabria."}

It is the most widely distributed species of owl, and one of the most widespread of all birds. The barn owl family Tytonidae is one of two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). It is known by many other names in different parts of the world, which is one of the problems with 'common names'. It is one of the main reasons Linnaeus invented his system of scientific naming.\nThis owl has long wings, a pale face, and a square-shaped tail. It lives in rural areas like farms and woodland. The barn owl has a wing span of 75\u2013110\u00a0cm and its body length measures up to around 25\u201350\u00a0cm. It weighs between 187 and 800 grams.\nBarn owls' breeding season is spring and it breeds in nests in trees. It eats small mammals, reptiles, fish, insects and smaller birds.\nEcology.\n\"Tyto alba\" is nocturnal, as usual for owls. However, it often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during the day, when it moves from a sleeping place it does not like.\nThis is a bird of open country such as farmland or grassland with some interspersed woodland. This owl prefers to hunt along the edges of woods. It has an effortless wavering flight as it moves over pastures or similar hunting grounds. Like most owls, the Barn Owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its flight feathers help to break up the flow of air over its wings, thereby reducing turbulence and the noise that accompanies it.\nDiet and feeding.\nIt hunts by flying low and slowly over an area of open ground, hovering over spots that conceal potential prey. They may also use fence posts or other lookouts to ambush prey. The Barn Owl feeds primarily on small vertebrates such as rodents.\nStudies have shown that an individual Barn Owl may eat one or more rodents per night; a nesting pair and their young can eat more than 1,000 rodents per year. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up most of the prey. Such animals probably make up at least three-quarters of the biomass eaten by each and every \"T. alba\", except in some island populations. In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the Bank vole in the 1950s has led to a major shift in the Barn Owl's diet: where their ranges overlap the vole is now by far the largest prey item.

When the King or Queen dies, the job passes to their son, daughter or next in line to the throne. As monarch of Australia, they then have ceremonial and constitutional duties as part of the government of Australia. The Governor General of Australia does the work of the monarch for the national Government. State Governors do the work of the monarch for State Governments of Australia.\nHistory.\nThe British First Fleet of convict ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 and New South Wales became a Crown Colony, with King George III of England as its King. The British set up other colonies all around Australia with powerful colonial governors chosen by Britain. From the 1820s, these colonies began to get more and more self-government and from the 1850s they began to become parliamentary democracies, which kept the Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom as their Heads of State, with royal duties done by Colonial Governors who had less and less real power.\nIn 1901, after a vote, the British colonies of Australia decided to become one country, with a constitutional monarchy with Queen Victoria as the monarch. The Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V) opened the first Parliament of Australia in 1901 and the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) opened the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927.\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1926, changed the situation in the British Empire, so that United Kingdom and the Dominions (like Australia, Canada and New Zealand) were to be seen as equal and independent, but \"united by a common allegiance to the Crown\". This situation of independent monarchies was confirmed by the Statute of Westminster. The Curtin Labor Government chose Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester (the brother of King George VI), as Governor-General during the Second World War.\nQueen Elizabeth II became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia in 1954, greeted by huge crowds across the nation. Her son Prince Charles went to school in Australia in 1967. Her grandson Prince Harry lived in Australia for some of his gap-year in 2003.\nThe Royal family was very popular for most of the 20th Century - but by the 1990s, some politicians and lots of people wanted Australia to become a republic. In 1999, the country had a referendum to become a republic, but the people chose to keep the Australian monarchy instead of changing to a republic.\nThe Monarch.\nAt the moment, the monarch of Australia is Queen Elizabeth II. She has the title of Queen of Australia and has reigned since 6 February 1952. She is represented in Australia by the Governor-General. The Governor-General does the work of the Queen in Australia and follows the rules of the Australian Constitution. He or she is chosen by the Prime Minister and appointed by the monarch.\nIn each of the States of Australia, the monarch is represented by a Governor. The Governors are appointed by the Queen after the state premiers tell her their choice.\nThe Australian monarch is also monarch of fifteen other Commonwealth countries known as Commonwealth realms: including Britain, New Zealand, Canada and Papua New Guinea.\nThe Governor General.\nThe Governor General is chosen by the Prime Minister and is appointed by the monarch to act as Head of State. The Governor General cannot behave like a politician or member of a political party, but must do the work of the monarch in Australia. The Governor General does things like opening parliament, and giving out awards on Australia Day. After elections, or when a government loses or wins a majority in the Australian House of Representatives, the Governor General is the person who legally decides that the prime minister has the numbers to lead a government.\nSome Governor-Generals belonged to the Royal Family and for a long time they all came from Britain, but for many years all Governor Generals have been Australians."}

Cartridge shells are ejected and new cartridges are loaded into the chamber automatically. However, most automatic rifles are designed to give both semi- and fully automatic fire. This is called selective fire. They also rifle bullets from a magazine. These features makes them different from other automatic firearms like the machine gun and submachine gun.\nUse.\nSoldiers in the United States Army who carry the M249 SAW are called \"automatic riflemen\". The weapon is also called an \"automatic rifle\". However, it is a fully automatic firearm. These are normally called squad automatic weapons (SAW) or light machine guns.\nAn assault rifle is quite similar to an automatic rifle. However, it uses less powerful bullets than the machine gun or battle rifle. This allows the soldier using it to control the recoil of the weapon without using a bipod or something similar. Bullets like these are called \"intermediate\" bullets. For example, the AK-47 assault rifle often uses a 7.62x39mm bullet. The bullet is the same diameter. However, it is smaller and less powerful compared to the 7.62x54mmR. The 7.62x54mmR was what was being used with rifles when the AK-47 was brought in to service.\nHistory.\nThe very first automatic rifle was the Mexican Mondrag\u00f3n rifle. It was designed by General Manuel Mondrag\u00f3n. He began working on the weapon in 1882. He patented it in 1887. In the 20th century, automatic rifles go back to World War I. This is where the Browning Automatic Rifle (B.A.R.) and Huot were first used. They were supposed to be used like light machine guns to help soldiers attack. However, only the Mondrag\u00f3n rifle and the B.A.R. were used in World War I."}

He decided in the end to write not just one, but three oratorios (a \u201ctrilogy\u201d). The first one was to be about the apostles being called to follow Jesus. This one was called \"The Apostles\" and was composed and performed in 1903. The second one was to be about the apostles being persecuted. This one, first performed in 1906, was given the title The Kingdom. The third one was going to be about the Last Judgement. Elgar never got round to composing it, although he thought about it as late as the 1920s.\nElgar prepared the words of \"The Kingdom\" himself. He describes events from the Acts of the Apostles, and he also put in lines from the Gospels, the Old Testament and the Apocrypha.\nA lot of the music is calm and thoughtful rather than dramatic. If Elgar had completed all three oratorios, \"The Kingdom\" would have been the middle one: quiet and relective between two more dramatic ones. As in \"The Apostles\" , Elgar used the idea of the Leitmotif. This is something that Richard Wagner had developed in his operas: the technique of having short tunes (motifs) which represent particular characters or events in the story.\nThe oratorio is divided into a prelude which is played by the orchestra, and five parts.\nPerformers.\n\"The Kingdom\" is written for a large orchestra. There is a double chorus (the choir split into 8 parts) with semichorus, and four soloists who represent The Blessed Virgin (soprano), Mary Magdalene (contralto), St John (tenor), and St Peter (bass).\nThe story of The Kingdom.\nIn the orchestral prelude we first hear tunes (motives) which we heard in \"The Apostles\". There are motifs which represent Jesus\u2019 sadness, and one for Peter, another one representing the new faith, Christ the Redeemer and the prelude ends by hearing these last two at the same time.\nPart I is about the Apostles and Holy Women meeting after Christ\u2019s Ascension. Matthew is chosen to take Judas\u2019 place.\nPart II is quite short. Mary (Christ\u2019s mother) and Mary Magdalene are talking about a lame man and remembering how Jesus healed the blind and the lame.\nPart III is about the Pentecost. This is when the Holy Spirit came down and gave the apostles the ability to speak all languages so that they could tell everybody in the world about Jesus. Peter tells everybody that they should be baptised in the Name of the Lord.\nPart IV John sings a big duet with Peter. They preach to the crowd about Jesus\u2019s resurrection, so they get arrested. After their arrest Mary prays for the two men (this is not in the Bible, it was Elgar\u2019s idea).\nPart V The opening chorus is heard in a different form. The Apostles and Holy Women take communion and sing the Lord's Prayer. Christ the Redeemer appears, and the work finishes with the theme of the new faith. The music does not end in a loud burst of glory, but quietly and peacefully."}

He was one of the leading figures of early colonial New South Wales. He was the first native-born Australian to get a reputation overseas. He wanted self-government for the Australian colonies.\nEarly life.\nIn 1796 Wentworth arrived in Sydney. It was then a poor prison settlement. The family lived at Parramatta. His father became a prosperous landowner. In 1802 he was sent to England. He went to a school in London. He returned to Sydney in 1810. He was appointed acting Provost-Marshall by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. He was given a land grant of on the Nepean River.\nOn 15 October 1810, at Hyde Park, Wentworth won the first official horse races on Australian soil.\nCrossing the Blue Mountains.\nIn 1813 Wentworth, along with Gregory Blaxland and William Lawson, led the trip which found a route across the Blue Mountains. The town of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains is named for him. As a reward he was given another .\nStudying in England.\nWentworth returned to England in 1816.

He said there should be an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts.\nWentworth successfully completed his legal studies by 1822 and was called to the bar. In 1823 he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge. That year he also published an epic poem \"Australasia\", which contains lines now famous in Australia:\nPolitical life.\nWentworth returned to Sydney in 1824. He was joined by Robert Wardell. His father died in 1827 and William inherited his property. This made him one of the wealthiest men in the colony.\nWentworth became Vice-President of the Australian Patriotic Association and founded a newspaper, \"The Australian\". It was the colony's first privately owned paper.\nHe was elected to the Council in 1843 and soon became the leader of the conservative party. He was against the liberals led by Charles Cowper. In 1853 Wentworth chaired the committee to draft a new constitution for New South Wales. In 1856 Wentworth retired from the Council and settled in England.\nHe died in England, but at his request his body was returned to Sydney for burial.\nRecognition.\nThe towns of Wentworth and Wentworth Falls, the federal Division of Wentworth, an electorate in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, the Wentworth Falls waterfall, and Wentworth Avenue which runs through the suburb of Kingston in Canberra, were named after him.\nIn 1963 he was honoured, together with Blaxland and Lawson, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post showing the Blue Mountains crossing.

It has metal armour and has large (heavy caliber) guns. Battleships are larger, better armed and armored than cruisers and destroyers. Battleships were mainly around from about 1880 to the 1940s, though some were still used as late as the Gulf War in 1991. For most of this time, battleships were the most powerful and most expensive kind of warship. Today some battleships are still around but these are museums.\nIn the 19th century, different countries tried to build bigger and better warships. One of the first ships with iron\u00a0armor was called\u00a0\"Gloire\", from 1859. This ship had both sails and a steam engine which drove a propellor, as well as guns the fired explosive shells. This was a kind of ship called an ironclad. A few years later, ironclads were used in the American Civil War.\nBritain and France kept trying to build warships that were better than each other. Later in the 19th century other countries like Germany, Russia, Japan, Italy and the United States also built many battleships. Different countries used new inventions to make their ships more powerful, with things like steel armour, rifled guns, and better kinds of steam engine. By around 1890 people started to call their best ships 'battleships' instead of 'ironclads'. Many people, including many Admirals and politicians, thought battleships were very important. If there was a war, the country with the best battleships would win, by sinking the other side's navy and stopping them bringing food and goods into their country (called a blockade). But battleships were also very expensive, and other people thought it was better to spend the money on a better army, or things like pensions for old people. \nIn 1906, Britain made a new kind of battleship called HMS Dreadnought. Though this ship was not much bigger, it had steam turbine engines which made it faster. All of its guns were also very large, which meant it could damage other battleships more from further away. People claimed one ship like Dreadnought could beat two earlier battleships, even battleships made just a few years before. Soon many countries were building ships like this, and calling them 'Dreadnoughts'.\nMany battleships were used in the First World War. However, battleships were so important and expensive that neither side wanted to take a chance of losing a battle with them. There were several battles with battleships. The biggest one was the Battle of Jutland which involved dozens of battleships and hundreds of smaller ships. But none of the battles made much difference. Submarines made a bigger difference to the war, even though less people had expected them to. At the end of the War, Germany was made to hand over all their battleships to Britain. However, the German navy sank (\"scuttled\") their own battleships rather than give them to the British. In 1922, most countries which had big navies signed a treaty called the Washington Naval Treaty which meant no-one would build new battleships for at least 10 years.\nBattleships were also important at the start of World War II. But by the middle of World War II, battleships had become less important than aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers had dozens of airplanes which could drop bombs or torpedos. Even though battleships had thicker armour than ever, several hits from bombs or torpedos would still sink a battleship. The planes could fly much further than a battleship's guns could shoot. There were some important battles between battleships in World War II, but more often battleships were less important than aircraft carriers. At battles like the Battle of Taranto and the Battle of Pearl Harbour many battleships were sunk by planes.\nAfter World War II there was not much point to a battleship. Aircraft carriers had become even better, because of jet aircraft and missiles. Also, even a heavily armored battleship could be sunk by a nuclear bomb. Even so the United States Navy kept a few battleships during the Cold War. The very big guns on a battleship were still useful to shoot at shore targets if there was an invasion from the sea. American battleships were also given new weapons like guided missiles to make them more useful if there was a war with Russia. However, only the United States could afford to keep battleships like this. No-one else did. Some American battleships shot at Iraq in the Gulf War. This was the last time when any battleships fought. The United States kept battleships until 2004, when the last ones were made into museums. "}

In that case, the play will be scored both as a hit (for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to) \"and\" an error. However, if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder's mistake, it is scored as a \"hit on error,\" and treated the same as if a batter was put out, which would lower his batting average.\nSimilarly, a batter does not receive credit for an RBI when runs score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake. For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in.\nIf a play should have resulted in a fielder's choice with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely but the runner is safe due to an error, the play will be scored as a fielder's choice, with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder.\nPassed balls and wild pitches are separate statistical categories and are not scored as errors."}

During her childhood, her family moved many times. She read a lot. She attended Holy Cross College.\nMcCullough earned a living as a teacher, librarian, and journalist. In her first year of medical studies at the University of Sydney she suffered dermatitis. She was told not to be a medical doctor. Instead, she switched to neuroscience and worked in Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.\nIn 1963, McCullough moved to the United Kingdom for four years. At Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, she met the chairman of the neurology department at Yale University. He offered her a research associate job at Yale. McCullough spent ten years from April 1967 to 1976 researching and teaching in the Department of Neurology at the Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. It was while at Yale that she wrote her first two books.\nBecause these books were successful, McCullough stopped being a doctor. In the late 1970s, she lived in London and Connecticut, USA. She finally picked Norfolk Island in the Pacific. There she met her husband, Ric Robinson (then 33 years old). They married on 13 April 1983 (she was 46 years old).\nIn 1984 a portrait of McCullough, painted by Wesley Walters, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize. The prize is for the \"best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics\".\nMcCullough did a lot of historical research for the novels on ancient Rome. This led to her getting a Doctor of Letters degree by Macquarie University in 1993.\nMcCullough was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She now lives in Sydney.\nSome people did not like McCullough's 2008 novel \"The Independence of Miss Mary Bennett\".

They are all called Indigenous Australians. It includes a variety of distinctive traditional music styles practiced by Indigenous Australian people. It also has a range of contemporary musical styles of and fusion with European traditions. Music has formed an strong part of the social, cultural and ceremonial observances of these peoples. This is true both in the far past and the present day. There are performance and musical instrumentation which are unique to particular regions or Indigenous Australian groups. There are some musical traditions which are common through much of the Australian continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is part of New Guinea. \nIn addition to these traditions, there has been an influence from the 18th century European colonisation. Likewise non-indigenous artists and performers have used and sampled indigenous Australian styles and instruments in their works. Contemporary musical styles such as rock and roll, country, rap and reggae have all featured a variety of notable Indigenous Australian performers.\nTraditional instruments.\nDidgeridoo.\nA didgeridoo is a type of musical instrument. It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It has a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are usually made of eucalyptus, but new materials such as PVC piping can be used. \nClapsticks.\nA clapstick is a type of musical instrument that is in the category of percussion. Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to strike a drum, clapsticks are for striking one stick on another.\nTraditional forms.\nBunggul.\nBunggul is a style of music that came into being around the Mann River. It is known for its intense lyrics. They are often stories of epic journeys. They continue, or repeat, unaccompanied after the music has stopped.\nClan songs and songlines.\nA particular clan in Aboriginal culture may share songs. Songs are about clan or family history. They are often updated to take into account popular movies and music, controversies and social relationships.\nSonglines are about Dreamtime. They have oral lore and storytelling in a series of song cycles. These songs often describe how the features of the land were made and named during the Dreamtime. By singing the songs in the right order, indigenous Australians could travel vast distances. \nDeath Wail.\nA mourning lament recorded in a number of places in central and northern Australia and among the Torres Strait Islanders.\nKrill Krill.\nThe Krill Krill song cycle is new music from east Kimberley. A man named Rover Thomas discovered the ceremony in 1974. This was after a woman to whom he was spiritually related was killed. Thomas says he was visited by her spirit and she gave him the ceremony. In addition to the music, Thomas and others, including Hector Jandany and Queenie McKenzie, made a famous style of painting to go with the ceremony.\nKun-borrk.\nKun-borrk was started around the Adelaide, Mann and Rose Rivers. It has a didgeridoo start and then percussion and vocals. The vocal often include words.\nWangga.\nWangga started near the South Alligator River. It has a very high note to start the song. This joined by rhythmic percussion. It is followed by a sudden shift to a low tone.\nContemporary trends.\nA number of Indigenous Australians have had mainstream success, such as Jimmy Little, Yothu Yindi, Troy Cassar-Daley and NoKTuRNL. Indigenous music has also had broad exposure through the world music movement. Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu had international success singing contemporary music in English and in the language of the Yolngu.\nTorres Strait Islander musicians include Christine Anu and Seaman Dan."}

It was first performed in Milan, on February 9, 1893. Verdi's last opera and perhaps greatest masterpiece, composed when he was 80, and only his second comedy since his earlier attempt \"Un giorno di regno\" in 1840.\nThe composition of the opera.\nWhen Verdi composed \"Falstaff\" he was not writing it for a commission. He was just writing it for his own pleasure, without a performance in mind. When he had finished it he felt that it would be his last work and that his life\u2019s work had finished. It was almost true. It was indeed his last opera and his last big work.\nWhen composers turn plays into operas they usually have to make some changes in the drama to make it suitable to be sung. Verdi had already turned two other Shakespeare plays into opera: \"Otello\" and \"Macbeth\". When he composed these he worked with librettists to create something as close to Shakespeare\u2019s plays as possible, but when writing \"Falstaff\" he took more freedom. The character of Falstaff is very close to the way he is shown in Shakespeare\u2019s \"Henry IV\" plays, rather than the Falstaff of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\".\nThe story of the opera.\nAct I.\nThis takes place in the Garter Inn (). Dr Caius, who is a rich man with servants, complains that Falstaff has beaten his servants and that Falstaff\u2019s two friends Bardolfo and Pistola made him drunk and then stole his money. Falstaff laughs at him. He says he will never get drunk again unless he is in the company of good, religious people. Bardolfo and Pistola in the background sing \u201cAmen\u201d until Falstaff stops them, complaining that they sing out of tune.\nFalstaff complains that his bill for the drinks is very high. He says that his two friends drink so much that he won\u2019t have enough to eat and he\u2019ll get thin and then he cannot be his proper self. He says he is in love with two ladies: Mrs Ford and Mrs Page. He has written love letters to them both. He asks his two friends to take the letters to them, but they refuse. Falstaff is cross and gets a page boy to take them instead. Then he chases his friends with a broom.\nThe next scene changes to the garden of Ford\u2019s house. Four ladies are in the garden: Alice Ford and Meg Page and also Mistress Quickly and Anne Ford, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Ford. Verdi calls her \u201cNannetta\u201d. The four of them look at the two letters that Alice and Meg have received and find they are exactly the same except for the address. They are amused and a bit annoyed, so they decide to tease Falstaff.\nMr Ford is walking with Dr Caius, Fenton and Falstaff\u2019s two friends. Fenton is a young man who is in love with Nannetta, but Ford does not want him to marry his daughter. Bardolfo and Pistola have deserted Falstaff. They tell Ford that Falstaff is in love with his wife. He is cross, of course, and plans revenge. The music of the four ladies and the music of the five men is sometimes heard separately, and sometimes it is combined. Fenton and Nannetta stay behind to kiss and they sing a love duet. When the men and ladies come back they each sing their own music again. This is a famous ensemble: the way Verdi has combined the two songs is very clever.\nAct II.\nBardolfo and Pistola are back in the Garter Inn with Falstaff. They pretend they are very sorry to have deserted Falstaff. They tell him that there is an old woman outside who wants to speak to him. It is Mistress Quickly, who comes in and curtseys very low to Falstaff. She gives him the message that Alice would love to see him, but that Meg\u2019s husband is guarding her and never leaves her by herself. He can see Alice when her husband is out between two and three o\u2019 clock (). Falstaff is pleased and gives Mistress Quickly a tip (some money) as she leaves. He sings to himself \u201cAlice is mine\u201d (\u201c\u201d).\nThe next visitor Falstaff has is Ford. Falstaff does not know who he is. Ford says his name is Master Brook (Signor Fontana). He gives Falstaff a purse with silver and tells him that he is in love with Mistress Ford (Alice). He asks Falstaff to get her for him. Falstaff says he will be seeing her that very afternoon. Ford asks him whether he knows Alice\u2019s husband (i.e. himself). Falstaff says he does and he describes to him what a terrible man Ford is. It is a very comic scene with a lot of very clever humour.\nWhen Falstaff goes out to change his clothes Ford shows his anger. When Falstaff returns the two men go out arm in arm like friends, arguing about who shall go through the door first.\nBack in Ford\u2019s house the four women are getting ready to tease Falstaff. From the conversation we learn that Ford wants Nannette to marry Dr Caius who is a fussy old man. Nannette of course wants to marry young Fenton.\nWhen Falstaff comes Alice is playing the lute. He sings to her accompaniment. When Quickly says that Ford is coming they hide Falstaff behind a screen. Ford and his men start to search another part of the house, and the women hide Falstaff inside a big laundry basket with dirty clothes. Ford comes back, he hears the sound of kissing and thinks it is his wife with Falstaff, but he finds it is Nannetta and Fenton. Ford goes out furiously, and the women quickly throw the laundry basket out of the window into the river Thames below. When Ford comes back his wife takes him to the window and he sees Falstaff, who is very wet, getting out of the river.\nAct III.\nFalstaff is recovering in the Inn. He is very grumpy, although he starts to cheer up when wine is brought. Mistress Quickly comes in and says he can meet Alice, but Falstaff is not really in a mood for this. In the end Quickly manages to persuade him to meet Alice at Herne the Hunter\u2019s Oak in Windsor forest. There is a legend about a black hunter who hanged himself from this tree, and so the spot is haunted by witches and sprites. Falstaff is told he must disguise himself as the black hunter.\nThe men and women sing an ensemble in which they describe the plot they have made to tease Falstaff. Ford also plots to announce that Caius will marry Nannette.\nThe last scene takes place at night under Herne\u2019s Oak. The moon shines. Fenton sings an aria. Falstaff appears in his disguise, wearing a pair of antlers on his head and wrapped in a big cloak. Midnight strikes. For a moment he is alone with Alice, but then she leaves him by himself. Nannetta is disguised as the Queen of Fairies. She and her friends sing beautiful music. Falstaff has hidden his face in his cloak, but everyone goes to him and torments him. When people take off their masks Falstaff feels really stupid, although he tries to say that his wittiness helped the joke. Ford announces that Nannetta will marry Caius. Alice leads another couple to him and he announces that they too will marry. When they take off their masks he finds that Bardolfo was disguised as Nannetta, so he will marry Caius! The other couple were Fenton and Nannetta in disguise. Now it is Ford who looks stupid, and Falstaff takes the opportunity to tease him. They finish by singing \u201c\u201d (\u201cJoking is man\u2019s vocation. Wise is he who is jolly\u201d). The music is a fugue, which is usually thought of as being a serious academic form, but the mood here is jolly.\nAn engravement was made in favour of Falstaff's existence; (\"Where 'o where shall the holly be on the night of song, more for thee to ascend in me.\")"}

The meme began on the /int/ board of Krautchan.net in 2009. The meme takes the form of large number of online comics. In the comics, countries are drawn as balls. The balls interact in broken English, (except for those countries who have English as their main language) and ridicule national stereotypes and international relations.\nPolandball has its roots in an August 2009 'cyberwar' between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. Drawball.com allows Internet users to draw whatever they want. It also allows people to draw over others drawings. On the Polish flag internet, an idea was raised to draw the flag of Poland on the ball. Thousands of Poles managed to take over the drawball. The painting consisted of white on top of red. In the middle, the word \"POLSKA\" was written. After co-ordination from 4chan, this was then covered over by a giant Nazi swastika.\nKrautchan.net is a German-language imageboard. Its /int/ board is frequented by Russian-speaking netizens. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to \"Falco\". Falco is a British user on /int/. In September 2009 Falco created the meme using MS Paint. The meme was made in an apolitical way to troll \"Wojak\". Wojak is a Pole on the same board and contributes in broken English. Afterwards, Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by Russians.\nThemes.\nA description of Polandball is found on the subreddit /r/Polandballball, which reads \"Wiggly mouse-drawn comics where balls represent different countries. They poke fun at national stereotypes and the \"international drama\" of their diplomatic relations. Polandball combines history, geography, Engrish, and an inferiority complex. The comic series first became popular on a well known German image board /int/.\"\nThe premise of Polandball is it represents the history, relations with other countries, and stereotypes. It concentrates on Polish megalomania and national complexes. The meme gained in popularity after the plane crash in Smolensk which killed Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski. Interactions between countryballs are written in broken English and internet slang. This is similar to the Lolcat meme. Poland is purposely drawn as red on top of white. This is the opposite of the united nations flag. By the end of the cartoon, Poland weeps.\nSome Polandball comics are based on the premise that Russia can fly into space. This premise also includes Poland cannot fly into space. One of the most popular Polandball cartoons begins with the premise that Earth is going to be struck by a giant meteor. All countries with space technology leave Earth and go into orbit around the planet. At the end of the cartoon, Poland is still on earth and is crying. In broken English, Poland says their famous catchphrase \"Poland cannot into space\". In this humorous way, Russians stop discussion with Poles on which country is superior. Another Polandball comic delves into historic-political satire. Poland is seen to be boring other countryballs. Poland proclaims \"So when we crushed Russia and the turks [sic] were were the biggest country in the world... and..\". This leads other countryballs to laugh at it. Poland, by now irritated, utters \"kurwa\". Poland holds up a sign saying \"Internet serious business\". This is an internet slogan used to deride others who treat subjects with disdain. Then, in Polandball convention, Poland finishes by crying.\nPolandball meme in culture.\nIn 2014, released a game about Pollandball for Android. In this game, Poland can into space and the player's goal as long as possible to keep Poland there. There is also the opportunity to play for other countryballs.\nOther polandballs.\nPolandball can also include comics on other countries. By convention these comics are usually still referred to as Polandball. They can also be called countryballs. According to Lurkmore.to, Bavaria has its own ball. Other balls have been created for U.S. states, Brazil, Catalonia and Siberia. Singapore and Bermuda are drawn as a triangle and called Tringapore and Bermudatriangle, respectively. Israel takes the form of a hypercube (in reference to Jewish physics). Kazakhstan takes the form of a brick. Britain is shown wearing a top hat and monocle. The United States is shown wearing sunglasses. Nepal, Ohio, and Tampa are shown as animals with teeth almost like a tiger."}

It is a question that is asked in order to make a point: it does not need a reply.\nThe question is used as a rhetorical device or tool. The question is posed for the sake of persuasion, or to encourage the listener or reader to consider a message or viewpoint.\nSuggested dialogue.\nRhetorical questions suggest a dialogue which does not really exist. The speaker both asks and answers the question himself. A rhetorical question is often a statement in the form of a question.\nFor example, in \"Can't you do \"anything\" right?\", the words are not intended to start an investigation or to invite any response at all. What the words actually mean could change according to circumstance. It could be a little joke between friends, or it could be an insulting criticism. Generally, it would be taken to mean \"You can't seem to do anything right\".\nThe role of context is always important if someone asks \"What does that mean\". Consider this question: \"Do you think this treatment is just?\". There is no way of knowing whether this is a genuine question or not, because we do not know what the circumstances are. This is true of many kinds of communication, that what they mean varies according to circumstance.\nOn the other hand, \"Is it right for a murderer to be allowed out of prison after only ten years?\" clearly asks for the reply \"No!\". This is because the questioner has \"signalled\" what answer is expected. A neutral way to describe the situation might be: \"A convicted murderer spends at least ten years in jail\"."}

In 1953 she joined the Magnum Photos Agency. She became a full photographer with them in 1955. In 1955 she published her first collection of photographs, of a total of 30 monographs during her lifetime.\nBiography.\nEarly years (1923-1945).\nIngeborg Morath was born in Graz, Austria. Her parents were scientists. They went to different laboratories and universities in Europe during her childhood. She first went to French-speaking schools. In the 1930s her family moved to Darmstadt, a German intellectual center. Then they moved to Berlin.\nMorath's first encounter with \"avant-garde\" art was the Degenerate Art show by the Nazi party in 1937. It was supposed to make people not like modern art. \"I found a number of these paintings exciting and fell in love with Franz Marc's \"Blue Horse\"\", Morath later wrote.\nMorath went to Berlin University. At university, Morath studied languages. She learned French, English, and Romanian. Later she added Spanish, Russian and Chinese. Toward the end of World War II, Morath worked for factory service in Tempelhof, alongside Ukrainian prisoners of war. During an attack on the factory by Russian bombers, she ran on foot to Austria. In later years, Morath would not photograph war.\nMiddle Years (1945-1962).\nAfter the Second World War, Morath worked as a translator and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant. She worked for \"Heute\". Morath met photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna. She brought his work to Trabant's attention. Working together for \"Heute\", Morath wrote articles to go along with Haas' pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris.\nMorath was briefly married to the British journalist Lionel Birch. She moved to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph during a visit to Venice. Morath asked for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman. He was then an editor for \"Picture Post\" and running the picture-agency Report.\nMorath divorced Birch and returned to Paris. Her first jobs were stories that did not interest \"the big boys.\" She went to London on an early job to photograph the residents of Soho and Mayfair. Morath's portrait of Mrs. Eveleigh Nash, from that job, is among her best-known works. During the late 1950s Morath traveled widely. She covered stories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the United States, and South America. She worked for such publications as \"Holiday\", \"Paris Match\", and \"Vogue\". In 1955 she published \"Guerre \u00e0 la Tristesse\", photographs of Spain, with Robert Delpire. This was followed by \"De la Perse \u00e0 l'Iran\", photographs of Iran, in 1958. Morath published more than thirty monographs during her lifetime.\nLike many Magnum members, Morath worked as a still photographer on numerous motion picture sets. She met director John Huston while she was living in London. Huston's \"Moulin Rouge\" (1952) was one of Morath's earliest jobs. It was her first time working in a film studio.\nMarriage and family.\nMorath married the playwright Arthur Miller on February 17, 1962. They moved to the United States. Miller and Morath's first child, Rebecca, was born in September 1962. The couple's second child Daniel was born in 1966 with Down syndrome. He was institutionalized shortly after his birth. Today Rebecca Miller is a film director, actress, and writer.\nDeath.\nIngeborg Morath Miller died of cancer in New York City in 2002, at the age of 78."}

It is the female equivalent of male bowing in European cultures. The word \"curtsy\" comes from \"courtesy\" which means \"politeness\".\nAccording to Desmond Morris, the movements in the curtsey and the bow were similar until the 17th century. Only later did the difference between the female and the male gesture develop. The earlier, combined version is still performed by Restoration comedy actors.\nWhen a curtsey is very formal, the girl/woman bends the knees outward (rather than straight ahead), often sweeping one foot behind her. She may also use her hands to hold her skirt out from her body. In Victorian times, when women wore floor-length, hooped skirts, they curtsied using the pli\u00e9 movement borrowed from second-position in classical ballet in which the knees are bent while the back is held straight. Both feet and knees point out so the body lowers straight down. In this way, the lady lowers herself evenly, not to one side. \nTraditionally, women and girls curtsey to people who are of higher rank (more important) than they are, just as men and boys bow. Today this practice has become less common. In European cultures it is traditional for women to curtsey in front of members of the Royal family. This is sometimes called a \"court curtsey\" and is often very deep. Some female domestic workers curtsey for their employers. \nFemale dancers often curtsey at the end of a performance to show thanks or acknowledge applause from the audience. At the end of a ballet class, students will also curtsey or bow to the teacher and the pianist to thank them. According to Victorian dance etiquette, a woman curtseys before beginning a dance. Female Scottish highland dancers performing the national dances and the Irish jig also curtsey as well (at both the beginning and end for the national dances and at the end for the Irish Jig). Some female ballroom dancers will curtsey to their partners before beginning the Viennese Waltz. In some cultures females bow instead of curtseying."}

It is one of the most important cultural monuments in the country. Since the 1960s it has been one of the major tourist attractions in Vienna. The palace and gardens show the tastes and interests of Habsburg monarchs.\nEarly history.\nIn the year 1569, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II purchased a large floodplain of the Wien river. It was between Meidling and Hietzing. The emperor had the area to be fenced and put game there such as pheasants, ducks, deer and boar. This was the court's recreational hunting ground. In a small separate part of the area, \"exotic\" birds such as turkeys and peafowl were kept. Fishponds were built, too.\nThe name \"Sch\u00f6nbrunn\" (meaning \"beautiful spring\") is from an artesian well from which water was consumed by the court.\nDuring the next century, the area was used as a hunting and recreation ground. Eleonora Gonzaga, who loved hunting, spent much time there. She was given the area as her widow's residence after the death of her husband, Ferdinand II. From 1638 to 1643, she added a palace to the Katterburg mansion. In 1642 it was called \"Sch\u00f6nbrunn\" for the first time. The start of the Sch\u00f6nbrunn orangery seem to go back to Eleonora Gonzaga as well.\nGardens.\nThe sculpted garden space between the palace and the \"Sun Fountain\" is called the \"Great Parterre\". The French garden, a big part of the area, was planned by \"Jean Trehet\" in 1695. It has a maze.\nWestern parts were turned into English garden style in 1828\u20131852. At the outmost western edge, a botanical garden was made in 1828.\nSculptures.\nLining the Great Parterre are 32 sculptures, which represent deities and virtues.\nRecent history.\nAfter the end of the monarchy in 1918, the new Austrian Republic became the owner of Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. They made it a museum.\nLater it was used for important events such as the meeting between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.\nUNESCO catalogued Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace on the World Heritage List in 1996, together with its gardens, as a remarkable Baroque ensemble and example of synthesis of the arts."}

Lands which Iran kept are now known as Iranian Azerbaijan. Even though they live on two sides of an international border, the Azerbaijanis are a single ethnic group. However, northerners and southerners differ due to nearly two centuries of separate social evolution of Iranian Azerbaijanis and Russian/Soviet-influenced Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani language unifies Azerbaijanis, and is mutually intelligible with Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, Turkish, and the dialects spoken by the Iraqi Turkmen, all of which belong to the Oghuz, or Western, group of Turkic languages.

What their power is limited to is written in the constitution. If there is dispute about what the constitution means, this is decided by a court system that is independent from the representatives.\nConstitutional republics usually have a separation of powers. The separation of powers means that no single officeholder gets unlimited power. John Adams said that a constitutional republic was \"a government of laws, and not of men\".\nSupporters of such a republic argue that it is meant to be a safeguard against \"tyranny\". No office holder can get to a position of absolute power. However, some have argued that a constitution can be written in such a way that it lets tyranny arise, and that a constitution is therefore not a fail proof safeguard against tyranny.\nAristotle was the first to write about the idea in his works on politics.\nConstitutional monarchies are a special case: even though the monarch is not elected, the people still elect other governing bodies. The constitution also limits the power of the monarch.\nComparisons.\nComparisons can be made. There are countries which nominally are constitutional republics, but which have become (in effect) dictatorships. There are also countries which have no written constitution, and are monarchies, but which act in a similar way to constitutional republics."}

They live in temperate, broadleaf and mixed forests. The Amur Leopard almost extinct by human hunting. It's called human hunting since the humans tear down the forest so no tree and bushes so the leopard cannot hide. At that time, they hunt them and sell to get money.\nThe number of Amur cats is decreasing due to the human activity, invasion of domestic cats, and infectious disease. Because these cats play a huge role and the ecosystem cannot afford to lose such species, researchers found a way to regenerate the endangered animal.

Each country says whether vehicles will drive on the right-hand or left-hand side of the road. This is sometimes called the rule of the road. This basic rule makes traffic move more easily. It also lowers the risk of head-on collisions. Today about 66.1% of the world's people live in countries that drive on the right-hand side; 33.9% live in countries that drive on the left-hand side. \nThe side driven on is usually the inverse of the side on which a vehicle's steering wheel and instrument panel are located. That is, right-hand drive (RHD) vehicles are normal when driving on the left-hand side of the road, and left-hand drive (LHD) vehicles are used when driving on the right-hand side of the road. \nMost countries that drive on the left-hand side are former British colonies. However, some other countries still chose the left-hand side of the road. These countries include: Japan, Thailand, Nepal, Bhutan, Mozambique, Suriname, East Timor, and Indonesia. Today, only four European countries drive on the left-hand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, and Cyprus, all of which are islands. There are several countries where their territories that exist outside the mainland drive on a different side from the mainland. One well-known example is that all of China drives on the right-hand except for its Special Administrative Regions Hong Kong and Macau, which drive on the left-hand. \nHistorically, before the creation of the automobile, people mostly rode on the left-hand side, since most people were right-handed and would whip their horses with their left hands. Warriors in battle could also use their right hand to hold and control their weapon. However, during the 1700s, many farmers began to pull their vehicles using teams of horses rather than just one. This was so that the driver could easily whip all the horses and so that the driver could see how close their wheels were to colliding to another wagon. In 1794, France passed the first right-hand driving laws, and this law would spread with Napolean's conquests. The territories and regions of the former Austro-Hungarian and Portuguese Empires refused to change the direction of driving at first, but most eventually chose to drive on the right-side. Only Mozambique, East Timor, and Macau (all former Portuguese colonies) still drive on the left-side. Canada, Myanmar, Gibraltar, British Indian Ocean Territory, and a few countries in West Africa like Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia all switched to driving on the right hand side of the road."}

He made an independent kingdom. A dynasty was named after him. Diodorus Siculus calls him 'Atrapes'. Quintus Curtius wrongly names him 'Arsaces'.\nBiography.\nAt the end of the Achaemenid Empire, Atropates was governor (\"satrap\") of the Achaemenid province of Media. In the Battle of Gaugamela (October 331 BCE) between Darius and Alexander, Atropates was in charge of the Achaemenid troops of Media.\nWhen Darius lost he went to the Median capital of Ecbatana. Atropates helped him. Darius tried to get a new army but could not. He left Ecbatana in June 330 BCE. After Darius' death a month later at the hands of Bessus, Atropates surrendered to Alexander. Alexander first chose Oxydates as satrap of Media. In 328-327 BCE Alexander did not trust in Oxydates' loyalty. Atropates was made satrap again. In 325-324, Atropates gave Baryaxes (a rebel of the area) to Alexander. Alexander thought highly of Atropates.\nAlexander died on June 10, 323 BCE. Atropates' new son-in-law Perdiccas was named regent of Alexander's half-brother Philip III. After the \"Partition of Babylon\" in 323 BCE, Media was divided into two parts. The greater portion in the south-east was governed by Peithon, a general of Perdiccas. The smaller portion in the north west was given to Atropates. At some point, Atropates made his part of Media an independent kingdom. His son-in-law Perdiccas was murdered by Peithon in the summer of 320 BCE.\nLegacy.\nThe dynasty Atropates made would rule the kingdom for several centuries. They became vassals of the Seleucids, then as vassals of the Arsacids.\nThe area of Atropates' kingdom was known to the Greeks as \"Media Atropatene\" after Atropates. Then as simply \"Atropatene\". The Arsacids called it 'Aturpatakan' in Parthian, as did also the Sassanids. Eventually Middle Iranian 'Aturpatakan' became 'Azerbaijan'. This is where the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Iranian province of Azerbaijan get their name."}

A ghazal talks about both the pain of loss and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient. It started in 6th century Arabic verse. It comes from the Arabian panegyric qasida. The structure of the ghazal are similar in strictness to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In its style and content it is a genre with a lot of variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. It is one of the main poetic forms the Indo-Perso-Arabic civilization gave to the eastern Islamic world. \nThe ghazal spread into South Asia in the 12th century. This was because of the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic Sultanate. Although the ghazal is mostly a form of Dari poetry and Urdu poetry, today it is found in the poetry of many languages of the Indian sub-continent. \nGhazals were written by the Persian mystics and poets Rumi (13th century) and Hafiz (14th century), the Azeri poet Fuzuli (16th century), as well as Mirza Ghalib (1797\u20131869) and Muhammad Iqbal (1877\u20131938). Through Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749\u20131832), the ghazal became very popular in Germany during the 19th century. The form was used by Friedrich R\u00fcckert (1788\u20131866) and August von Platen (1796\u20131835). The Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali liked the form. He edited a volume of \"real ghazals in English\". \nIt is common in ghazals for the poet's name to be in the last verse. This is known as takhallus."}

The name means \"The Ploughman\".\nHistory.\nHasan bey Zardabi started the newspaper. He was a journalist, teacher and scientist. \"Akinchi\" was thought to be almost revolutionary because of the language it was made in and that so many people could read it. Zardabi used a simpler form of the Azeri language so more people could read the paper.\nThe Russian governor of the Caucasus Dmitry Staroselsky liked Zardabi's plans. Staroselsky supported him in starting \"Akinchi\". He was also the one to name the newspaper. He thought the name would make the authorities think that \"Akinchi\" was non-political and about agriculture. In addition to agriculture articles Zardabi wrote about medicine and biology. There were also stories about the social and cultural state of Muslims in the Caucasus. The first issue of \"Akinchi\" was printed on 22 July 1875.\nPartly because Staroselsky left, the paper ended on 29 September 1877. There was also little money and few readers. There were only 300 constant readers. The paper helped there be more journalism in Azerbaijan."}

It was used by his son Alexander the Great to conquer the Persian Empire. The formation was made up of spearmen carrying 18 to 20 ft (5.56 m) long spears. These were called sarissas. They were two-handed; the smaller shields were slung over the left shoulder. \nThe Macedonian phalanx was impregnable from the front, but vulnerable from the sides and back, where it could be attacked by the enemy cavalry. Therefore, the system required protection, which it got from the Macedonian cavalry, which was the most flexible force.\nAt the start of a battle, Alexander used the phalanx to pin down the enemy. His heavy cavalry would drive the enemy horse from the field, and then charge selected opponents or exposed enemy unit flanks. Then, the phalanx would move against the centre. \nThe early Greek city states often fought on narrow valley floors, where cavalry was not so important. Often, there was little or no cavalry. But in the Greco-Persian Wars, the battles were fought on more open land, where cavalry was a great force. An example of this is the Battle of Gaugamela. There, Alexander manoeuvered to the right to prevent a double envelopment from the Persian army. Darius commanded his cavalry on his left flank to check the oblique movement of the Greeks by attacking their cavalry. Alexander's Companion cavalry then charged the weakened enemy center where Darius was posted and were followed by the phalanx formation."}

All worms are invertebrates, meaning that they do not have a backbone. Worms can come in many different sizes. Many worm species are so small that they can't be seen with the human eye, while the bootlace worm has been known to grow up to nearly 60 meters (almost 200 feet). One of the most well-known types of worms are earthworms.\nThere are several subcategories of worms, many of which are very different than others. Annelids, nematodes, platyhelminthes, ribbon worms, arrow worms, priapulid worms, and some insect larvae are all of animals that are often called worms."}

It is from the company Gameforge AG. \"Ikariam\" is a strategy, text/picture based game. \"Ikariam\" was released in 2008. It is currently, as of May 2, 2012, on version 0.5.0. The game is set during the era of Ancient Greece.\nGameplay.\nThe aim of the game is to expand the town which is controlled by a player, to gather resources and conquer other players. The game can be played for short periods of time. The player can build and research and it is during real time so the player can return at a later point and assign the town's people a new tasks. Upon registering, players are given control of a small town. The town's people pay taxes to the player or can be sent to gather resources instead. The game world is split into islands, each of which can support up to 16 (or up to 17 if the player purchases ambrosia) players and their towns. Each island has a structure called a Saw Mill. There are four types of islands, one is a crystal, one is sulfur, one is wine, and one is marble. With those four resources the player may construct buildings such as barracks, shipyards and academies. Citizens of the town can then be trained as soldiers, sent to research new technologies, or perform other tasks, which they are paid tax money for undertaking. Citizens must be kept happy to prevent them from leaving the town. Citizens happiness factors change multiple ways, the construction of a tavern is one of the best ways to gain happiness. Another way to gain is by building museums and set up cultural treaties with other players.\nThe game also provides four advisors to guide the player throughout the game; they are shown in the top right of the screen. From left to right the names are: Towns, Military, Research and Diplomacy.\nBusiness Model.\nIkariam is free-to-play but players may opt to purchase in-game advantages via a Microtransaction system. This will give them access to a sixth resource called Ambrosia, which can be used for Ikariam Plus, the premium version of Ikariam.\nAlliances.\nOn building an embassy and upgrading it to level three a player is then able to create an alliance. An alliance is a group of players with the same interests or goals. The players can also put their own units into each others towns for extra defense. With an alliance you can do join raids and work together on taking over towns. If you are the leader of the alliance, how many members you can have in your alliance depends on your embassy level. Also, you get a small amount of \"bonus\" resources each day, depending on the number of people in your alliance. An alliance has three jobs that can be assigned by the leader: the Diplomat, the General and the Home Secretary. The diplomat is responsible for making treaties, answering messages sent to the alliance, and editing the external alliance page which is viewable by all players. The General is responsible for overlooking all alliance members military movements, and has the ability to call off any attacks being made by alliance members. The Home Secretary is responsible for editing ranks within the alliance and editing the internal alliance page which is viewed only by the alliance members.\nWorlds.\nThere are many worlds in \"Ikariam\". The current worlds go from Alpha to Ypsilon."}

It is a type of overexploitation where fish stocks are reduced to low levels. It is a good example of what is good for the short term is not good for the long term. Also, what is good for some fishermen is not good for all of them (tragedy of the commons). The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a 2018 report that 33.1% of world fish stocks are subject to overfishing.\nSo much fish is caught that there are too few adults of certain species left. With cod, for example, the greatest production of eggs is from large females. But these are caught, the average size of spawning females goes down. Eventually this gets so that the production of eggs is significantly reduced. The artificial selection of large fish has gradually reduced the size of mature females.\nThe Northwest Atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s. Sometimes, the fishing industry can ruin itself by overfishing. The collapse of the herring industry in Monterey, California is a good example. \nConsumers can get information about the conservation status of the seafood available to them.\nExamples of overfishing.\nExamples of overfishing can be found in places like the North Sea, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the East China Sea.\nPreventive measures.\nThere are many ways that have been suggested to stop overfishing.

For a decade the CIA had been sending in South Vietnamese teams on sabotage missions to the North. American ships such as the \"Maddox\" went on espionage missions in the North's coastal waters. U.S. President Johnson claimed that the North Vietnamese had made two attacks on the \"Maddox\" and the \"Turner Joy\" in the Gulf of Tonkin. On the 4th of August he asked for congressional support to return the attacks.\nBackground.\nThe government had written up a resolution in June 1964. Believing that the lives of American sailors were in danger from the North Vietnamese, Congress willingly passed the resolution. The resolution gave the president the power to start war in Vietnam. As Johnson said, it was \"like grandma's night shirt - it covered everything\". The resolution would end when the president believed that the situation in Southeast Asia was safe or when Congress decided to terminate it. Senator Mansfield was unconvinced that the U.S. was acting correctly.\nResults and significance.\nWith the resolution, Johnson appeared to have the nation behind him. Now the war could really be taken to the North. This escalation for the U.S. in the Vietnam War made Johnson look tough. His public approval rating rose from 42 to 72 percent, helping him to win the presidential election. The resolution and the presidential election suggested a nation united behind its president in his Vietnam policy."}

The line goes southeast to northwest beneath the northern Pacific Ocean; and many of the underwater mountains are guyots.\nThe seamount chain, with over 80 identified undersea volcanoes, stretches over from the Aleutian Trench in the far northwest Pacific to the Lo\u02bbihi seamount, the youngest volcano in the chain, which lies about southeast of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi. \nThe oldest age for the Emperor Seamounts is 81 million years, and comes from Detroit Seamount. However, Meiji Guyot, located to the north of Detroit Seamount, is likely somewhat older.\nIn 1963, geologist John Tuzo Wilson explained that the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain was created by a hotspot of volcanic activity that stood as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over it. This left a trail of volcanic islands and seamounts. A \"bend\" or \"V\" in the chain marks a shift in the movement of the Pacific plate some 47 million years ago, from a northward to a more northwesterly direction. The bend shows how a tectonic plate can shift direction suddenly. A look at the USGS map on the origin of the Hawaiian Islands clearly shows this \"spearpoint\".\nRecent research shows that the hotspot itself may have moved with time. Some evidence comes from analysis of the orientation of the ancient magnetic field preserved by magnetite in ancient lava flows sampled at four seamounts."}

The key idea is that the growing embryo gets its nutrition from a placenta in the mother's womb. It is the standard method for all mammals except monotremes. \nOvoviviparity.\nThose reptiles which do not lay eggs mostly keep soft-shelled eggs inside their bodies. The embryo exists on the material in the egg. They are ovoviviparus, because of the source of nutrition. However, there are some amphibians and a few reptiles which are genuinely viviparous because they get their nutrition direct from the mother.\nIn plants.\nViviparous plants produce seeds that germinate before they detach from the parent. In many mangroves, for instance, the seedling germinates and grows under its own energy while still attached to its parent. Then it drops into the water to transport away. \nIn some trees, like jackfruit, the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe. This condition is not vivipary because the moist and humid conditions just mimics a wet soil. However, the seeds can germinate under soil too."}

The word is thought to derive from the base \"skell-\", \"to ring/resound\" and the diminutive suffix \"-ling\". The slang term for a shilling as a currency unit was a \"bob\".\nThe abbreviation for shilling is s, from the Latin \"solidus\", the name of a Roman coin. Often it was informally represented by a slash, standing for a long s: \"e.g.,\" \"1/6\" would be 1 shilling and sixpence, often pronounced \"one and six\" (and equivalent to 18d; the shilling itself was valued at 12d). A price with no pence would be written with a slash and a dash, \"e.g.,\" \"11/-\". Quite often a triangle or (serif) apostrophe would be used to give a neater appearance, \"e.g.,\" \"1'6\" and \"11'-\". In Africa it is often abbreviated sh.\nDuring the Great Recoinage of 1816, the mint was instructed to coin one troy pound (weighing 5760 grains) of standard (0.925 fine) silver into 66 shillings, or its equivalent in other denominations. This effectively set the weight of the shilling, and its subsequent decimal replacement 5 new pence coin, at 87.2727 grains or 5.655\u00a0grams from 1816 to 1990, when a new smaller 5p coin was introduced."}

HOP was formed by Croatians in exile. Usta\u0161e was movement with nationalistic ideas. It also had fascist tendencies. After the Second World War, there were some fights concerning the leadership of Usta\u0161e. In 1956, Ante Paveli\u0107 formed the Croatian Liberation Movement in Buenos Aires. The goal of HOP was to control the original Usta\u0161e organization. Because of its roots, HOP is widely seen as a successor of the Usta\u0161e. In the early 1990s, the state of Yugoslavia disintegrated, and the parts it was made of became independent republics. In 1991, HOP moved to Zagreb; and the organization was registered as a political party. In 1997, HOP came into public limelight for paying a requiem mass for the Usta\u0161e leader Paveli\u0107 in the Church of Saint Dominic in Split.\nMission.\nOne of the goals of the Croatian Liberation Movement is to re-establish the state of Croatia with the borders it had during the Second World War. At that time, the state also included Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHistory.\nCroatian Liberation Movement was founded by Ante Paveli\u0107 in Buenos Aires in 1956. In 1957, after some people tried to kill Paveli\u0107, he and his family moved to Spain. Paveli\u0107 died on 28 December 1959, at the German hospital in Madrid. After Paveli\u0107's death, his son-in-law Sre\u010dko P\u0161eni\u010dnik took over HOP. In 1960, he moved its operations from Buenos Aires to Toronto, Canada.\nAnother part of the HOP was established in Australia in 1963. The leaders of this group were Sre\u0107ko Rover (from 1963 to 1967) and Stjepan Hefer (from 1967 to 1973). Many of this group's members were also members of the Australian Liberal Party. Some of them were said to have gone on military training exercises with the Australian Army Reserve, using the army's base at Wodonga in Victoria. Several members of the opposition Labor Party, including Justin O'Byrne, said that the HOP were using their status in the Liberal Party to hide many of these activities. When the Labour Party became the government in 1972, the Attorney-General gave the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) permission to spy on Sre\u0107ko Rover and a few of the group's other members. This was because they thought they might be recruiting insurgents for an overseas war.\nWhen Yugoslavia was dissolved in the early 1990s, this organization moved to Zagreb, Croatia, where it was officially registered as a political party in 1991."}

{"id": "344709", "revid": "115351", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344709", "title": "Le Dieu Bleu", "text": "Le Dieu Bleu () is a ballet in one act. Jean Cocteau and Federico de Madrazo y Ochoa wrote the story of the ballet. Reynaldo Hahn wrote the music. Michel Fokine designed the dances, and L\u00e9on Bakst designed the sets and costumes. The ballet was first performed in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet on 13 May 1912. It was a failure. Critics thought Nijinsky the dancer for whom the ballet was designed did more posing than dancing. Producer Sergei Diaghilev blamed Hahn's music for the failure. \"Le Dieu Bleu\" was staged three times in Paris in 1912 and three times in London in 1913. The ballet has not been revived.\nBackground.\nBallet impresario and producer Sergei Diaghilev staged two exotic ballets for the Ballets Russes: \"Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre\" in 1909 and \"Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade\" in 1910. Both were great successes with the Parisian public. He hoped that \"Le Dieu Bleu\" (another exotic ballet) would be equally successful. \n\"Dieu\" was one of six new ballets for the 1911 Ballets Russes season. The others were \"Narcisse\", \"La Peri\", \"Le Spectre de la Rose\", \"Sadko\", and \"Petrushka\". Michel Fokine would design the dances for all of them. L\u00e9on Bakst would design the sets and costumes for the first four. When Fokine and Bakst started work on Ida Rubinstein's ballet \"Le Martyre de Saint S\u00e9bastien\", Diaghilev felt betrayed. He pushed \"Dieu\" forward to 1912. He lost interest in \"Dieu\", but spent huge amounts of money on the production. He hoped \"Dieu\" would make Nijinsky a great international star.\nFokine started work on \"Dieu\" in St Petersburg in the winter of 1911-1912. He based some of his ideas for the ballet on the dances of the Royal Siamese Court ballet. This company had danced in St Petersburg in 1900. Fokine also made a study of the arts of India. In the end though\n, his dances for \"Dieu\" were dull. \nHahn's music could have been the reason. It was not very good. Prince Lieven, a critic and historian of the Ballets Russes, said the music had no interest or importance. He said that it was \"sweet and insipid\". Bakst based his ideas for the sets and costumes on the printed materials for the Cambodian Ballet's 1906 performances in France.\nFirst performance.\nThe ballet was first presented by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet on 13 May 1912. Another ballet, \"Thamar\", was also on the program. Both ballets were failures. Diaghilev was shocked by the failure of \"Thamar\". He thought it would be another success like \"Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade\". He was not surprised that \"Dieu\" was a failure. He privately blamed Hahn's music for its failure. The music was dull. He was forced to use it because Hahn had rich friends in Paris. They would have cut their support of the Ballets Russes if the music had been turned down.\nCast.\nThe ballet was designed for Nijinsky. He had yet to dance an important part for the Ballets Russes. He was cast as The Blue God. Diaghilev hoped The Blue God would make the dancer an internationally famous star. Other dancers in the ballet were Max Frohman as The Young Man, Tamara Karsavina as The Young Girl, Lydia Nelidova as The Goddess, and Michel Federov as The High Priest. Nijinsky's sister Bronislava Nijinska was cast as The Drunken Temple Dancer.\nStory of the ballet.\nThe curtain rises on a warm evening in India a long time ago. In front of a temple of rock, a pool is seen with a lotus on the surface of the water. Snakes and other animals rest near the pool. The temple walls are covered with masses of flowering plants. People are waiting for a ceremony to take place. The Young Man is about to become a priest of the temple. The Young Girl runs in. She kneels at the feet of The Young Man. She does not want him to desert her for the life of a priest. She dances before him. The priests are shocked. They lead The Young Man out. They prepare The Young Girl for death. \nThe gates are shut. The Young Girl tries to get out. Monsters rise from a place under a trap door. The Goddess rises from the lotus. The Blue God rises from the pool. He calms the monsters with his flute. The monsters are trapped by the masses of plants. The Blue God's work is done. The priests come in. They are surprised to see The Young Girl still living, and fall on their knees before her. The Young Man rejoins The Young Girl. The Goddess orders golden stairs to come down from the sky. The Blue God flies up the stairs and disappears into the clouds.\nWhat people thought about the ballet.\nDiaghilev hoped that \"Dieu\" would be a great success. It was not. People thought Nijinsky's talent had been wasted. They said that he posed more than he danced. What people liked the most about the ballet was Bakst's sets and costumes. Valery Svetlov wrote in the \"Mercure de France\" on 15 May 1912 that \"Dieu\" was \"a failure in every sense of the word.\" The ballet was presented three times in Paris in 1912 and three times in London in 1913. Bakst's costumes and set were revived for a week-long Diaghilev Festival directed and staged by Andris Liepa in London, April 2011, with new choreography by Wayne Eagling to music by Scriabin. The role of the Blue God was played by Nikolai Tsiskaridze. This production was also not well received."}

The treaty also gave the Channel Islands to England. Henry gave up control of Maine, Anjou and Poitou, which had been lost under the reign of King John but remained Duke of Aquitaine and was able to keep the lands of Gascony and parts of Aquitaine but only as a vassal to Louis.\nIn exchange, Louis withdrew his support for English rebels. He also ceded to Henry the bishoprics and cities of Limoges, Cahors and P\u00e9rigueux and was to pay an annual rent for possession of Agenais."}

In the Treaty of Paris (1259), Gascony was given to England, as a fief. On all occasions when there was a change of monarch in France or England, the vassal England had to give praise to its lord, France. Edward I of England did this, in the years 1272 and 1285, and also reminded France that it had the same duties. 1294, the treaty was broken. Philip IV of France occupied Guyenne, in Gascony. The English king made it an Allodial title, and was prepared to go to war over it. Philip was only able to keep Guyenne until 1303. With the Treaty of Paris, Edward obtained Guyenne, as well as the cities of Bordeaux and Bayonne. Edward II of England gave allegiance to the French King, and married his daughter, Isabella."}

The design has undergone slight modifications since then, namely in 1971 in 2002 when mantling and the indentations of the chief were modified respectively, but the influence of the original design is still clearly visible in the modern blazon.\nThe arms act as a governmental and national symbol in addition to being the personal arms of the king; only the king, however, may display the royal crown ensigning the coat of arms.\nHistory.\nThe General Maritime Treaty of 1820 gave Bahrain protected status (not as a protectorate of the United Kingdom). In 1932, the advisor to the Ruler, Charles Belgrave, designed a coat of arms for the Ruler, Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa. The original heraldic achievement was red with a white chief dancet\u00e9e of three ensigned by an heraldic \"ancient crown\" of eight points, with five being visible in renditions.\nAfter the United Kingdom withdrew from Bahrain in 1971, red mantling with a white lining was added to the coat of arms as a symbol of the island nation's newly acquired independent sovereignty. The mantling is displayed around the shield without a helm or torse, in a manner unusual to traditional heraldic practice. The Princely coat of arms still displayed the Crown when used as the personal arms of Emir, though the Crown was modified to have smaller points displayed between the space of each point. The arms displayed with the mantling sans Crown became the arms of dominion for Bahrain.\nThe heraldic device has been most recently altered in 2002, when the emirate was declared a kingdom by Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa. The shield remains red, but the white chief dancet\u00e9e now includes five indentations to represent the five pillars of the Muslim faith, rather than the three as was originally assumed in 1932.\nThe design on the shield is nearly identical to the design of the national flag, the only difference being that the whole of the design is rotated so that the chief of the shield appears as the hoist of the flag. The current coat of arms of Bahrain was made in 1932 by Charles Belgrave."}

It is achromatic (without color) and in crystal form. Under high pressure and temperature, the compound can be produced from xenon and fluorine directly.\nXenon difluoride is used in organic syntheses as fluorinating agent.\nXenon difluoride can be destroyed by heating. It then results in the pure substances fluorine and xenon. This reactions happens explosively, even though that the enthalpy of reaction is negative (formula_2). That is because the reaction changes the state of matter from solid to gas. The gas needs more space in room."}

To market this movie, WCW hired Arquette to appear on their TV show and win their world title. Arquette argued he should not win the belt because he is not a real wrestler but WCW talked him into it. The attention received was only negative and the backlash eventually caused WCW to go out of business. The movie was also a critical disaster that ruined the careers of some of the actors in it, like Oliver Platt.\nBecause Arquette is also a wrestling fan in real life, he regretted making a mockery of wrestling and donated the money he made from WCW to families of dead wrestlers Owen Hart and Brian Pillman and also to Darren Drozdov, who was paralyzed in a wrestling match.\nArquette was a contestant on the 13th season of \"Dancing with the Stars\" in fall 2011."}

The battery allows the user to ride the lift even if the power goes out.\nTypes of stairlifts.\nStraight Rail Stair Lifts - A straight rail stair lift is the most common type of stair lift on the market because it\u2019s designed for the types of stairs most common in homes. With a straight rail stair lift, the rail is attached to the treads of the stairs by legs and are spaced approximately a foot apart.\nCurved Rail Stair Lifts - Curved rail stair lift mapped to the unique curvature of a staircase as a result, the planning and installation process can be a bit more expensive since it requires more unique customisation and a potentially longer rail.\nPlatform Stair Lifts - Wheelchair or platform stair lifts take the standard seat-style stair lift but add enough room for a wheelchair to be carried up stairs. These stair lifts can necessitate more power than traditional curved or straight rail stair lifts as well, and are therefore most common in commercial buildings, hospitals, or assisted living facilities and nursing homes."}

With the French occupation of Turin during the Napoleonic War the theatre was renamed the \"Teatro Nazionale\" and finally, after Napoleon became emperor, renamed again as the \"Teatro Imperiale\". When Napoleon's lost power in 1814 it got its original name back: the \"Regio\".\nOther theatres were built and gave seasons of opera in Turin. Among them was the restored \"Teatro Carignano\" in 1824. It was taken over by the municipality in 1932 and, after the destruction by fire of the \"Teatro Regio\" in 1936, the Carignano was the main opera house in the city until the \"Regio\" reopened in 1973.\nThe Regio was rebuilt in 1905 but the theatre closed during the First World War and re-opened in 1919. Until February 1936, seasons of opera were presented until fire then destroyed everything except the front of the building. It remained closed for thirty-seven years. Arturo Toscanini was the conductor of the Turin Opera from 1895 to 1898, during which time several production of works of Wagner were given their first Italian performances.\nThe opera house was rebuilt an opened in 10 April 1973 with a production of Verdi's \"I Vespri Siciliani\" directed by Maria Callas and Giuseppe Di Stefano.\nThe new house, which uses the original frontage, seats 1,750 and is elliptical in shape with a large orchestra level and 37 boxes. An acoustic shell was added to improve its sound. Many operas are performed there, including modern operas."}

He was born in Sagordari, a village in Keshobpur Upozila, Jessore District, East Bengal (now in Bangladesh). He was a pioneer of Bengali drama. His famous work \"Meghnad Bodh Kavya\", is a tragic Novel. It has nine cantos and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and pains of love as spoken by women. \nFrom an early age, Dutt wanted to be an Englishman in form and manner. In later life, he regretted his attraction to England and the Occident. He wrote lovingly of his homeland in his poems and sonnets from this period.\nHis early writings were in English, but they were unsuccessful. He turned, reluctantly at first, to Bengali. His main works, written mostly between 1858 and 1862, include prose drama, long narrative poems, and lyrics. His first play, \"Sarmistha\" (1858), was well received. His poetical works are \"Tilottamasambhab\" (1860), a narrative poem on the story of Sunda and Upasunda; \"Meghnadbadh\" (1861), his most important piece, an epic on the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a theme; \"Brajangana\" (1861), a cycle of lyrics on the \"R\u0101dh\u0101-K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\" theme; and \"Birangana\" (1862), a set of 21 epistolary poems on the model of Ovid\u2019s Heroides. \nDutt is widely said to be one of the greatest poets in Bengali literature.

Scientific models are used as a basis for scientific work. They can be used to explain, predict, and test, or to develop computer programs or mathematical equations.\nAn example of a complex model is the software used for weather forecasts. The program is based on equations for the variables which affect weather. Meteorological data is fed in, and the program produces predictions (graphs and data) of future weather patterns.\nA scientific model represents complex objects, events, and physical processes in a logical way.\nExamples.\nFor instance, models of our universe are part of astrophysics - the biggest things in nature - and physics - the smallest. This is not usually what we mean by nature, however. We mean the models studied in biology, ecology, economics, environmental health and healing. Most models of nature are of things that humans really affect directly, and which affect humans back:\nToxic waste.\nFor instance, to dump toxic waste in a river will harm others down the river. But without models of nature we do not know who, and cannot say how much is harmed or harmful.\nEffects.\nModels of nature affect human decision-making. They are very important to human health, wellness and economics. They also matter in ethics, since most people wish to reduce harm done by their decisions. They matter in law because harms can be proven to have been done in a court.\nForests.\nA forest is very hard to bring back to life, once it is degraded. Smaller models of bits of nature help to understand how much must be left, so future generations can use nature too.\nEffects on nature.\nIn many ways humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. Natural capital like soil and large healthy trees, which nature needs to make more of itself, is also useful to humans as natural resources. To know how much can be drawn out of nature, before it dies, is important. This is another reason for a model:\nThere are three main ways in which models of nature affect human life:\nPreservation.\nTo preserve nature, ecology movement activists now cooperate in a global power network. It includes not just parties in politics but also NGOs like Greenpeace, Earth First or World Wide Fund for Nature.\nEffects on maps.\nOne model of nature they have agreed on is a map that shows ecoregions, which are the natural borders of ecology maps. According to this map, there are 867 regions divided into 8 ecozones - plus others which are in the ocean.\nEffects on language.\nMost anthropologists agree that aboriginal languages have a small model of local nature in them. For instance, there will be more words to describe snow in an Arctic language, and more words to describe shades of green in a rainforest. This is part of the reason to use ecology borders in politics, since people who do not live inside the border do not see or make the same distinctions about nature.\nEffects on humans.\nA very small number of people think that humans do not need nature at all, and can replace everything that it does. To prove them wrong, some economists made another model of nature:\nEconomists study nature's services to see how hard it would be to replace what nature does for humans. They showed in 1995 that the services nature performed for humans were more valuable than all services humans perform for each other all over the world. The value of Earth as a living thing was much more than we could ever afford to replace with our own technology. There has been no real disagreement about any of this.\nPricing all the value of Earth to humans gives a huge number - which proves the pricing is right, since, we must put a high price on anything we have no way to replace."}

In a normal pregnancy, the embryo implants (sticks) itself into the wall of the uterus. The uterus is the only place in the body where an embryo can grow into a fetus.\nMost ectopic pregnancies happen in a Fallopian tube (one of the two tubes that connect the ovaries and the uterus). For this reason, ectopic pregnancies are often called tubal pregnancies. Rarely, ectopic pregnancies can happen in an ovary or in the cervix. \nEctopic pregnancies cannot become normal pregnancies, and will not result in a baby. They can also cause serious health problems for the mother.\nRisk Factors.\nRisk factors (things that make a woman more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy) include:\nSymptoms.\nAt first, there may be no symptoms. A woman may not even know she is pregnant at this point. Sometimes she might have pain in her pelvis, or bleeding from her vagina.\nBut once the embryo has grown for about 6 to 8 weeks, it gets large enough to make the Fallopian tube rupture (break open). This is a medical emergency, and can kill a woman.\nOnce the Fallopian tube has ruptured, it will start to bleed into the abdomen. Symptoms will include:\nDiagnosis and Treatment.\nA physician can do an exam of the pelvis to test for sensitivity and pain, to figure out if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy. There are also blood tests for the pregnancy hormone hCG. In a normal pregnancy, the hGC levels double every day. Low levels are evidence of a problem, like an ectopic pregnancy. An ultrasound can also be used to see if the embryo is implanted in the uterus or not.\nThere are two main ways to treat an ectopic pregnancy if it is diagnosed before the Fallopian tube ruptures. The first is with the medicine methotrexate. If it is given early enough, it can cause an abortion and end the pregnancy. The second is with a surgery called a laparoscopy (a surgery done with a laser). The surgeon makes a small cut in the belly and removes the embryo. A laparoscopy is done after the first few weeks of the pregnancy.\nOnce the Fallopian tube ruptures, emergency surgery is needed to fix the broken Fallopian tube and remove the blood from inside the abdomen. The patient may also needed to be treated for blood loss.\nResults.\nAn ectopic pregnancy cannot become a baby. But it can have effects on future pregnancies and fertility. Because in an ectopic pregnancy the embryo usually grows in a Fallopian tube, the Fallopian tube can become damaged. This makes it more likely for another embryo to get stuck there. The likeness of another ectopic pregnancy depends on the amount of damage to the Fallopian tube, and the health of the tubes. However, even after a ectopic pregnancy, it is entirely possible to have a normal pregnancy."}

All have long, hinged fangs that dig deep into their prey and inject venom. The venom causes internal bleeding. There are four subfamilies of the Viperidae.\nDescription.\nAll vipers have a pair of long hollow fangs which are used to inject venom from glands found in the back of the upper jaws. The venom is a kind of protease, a destroyer of protein.\nAlmost all vipers have ridged scales, a well built body with a short tail and, to make room for the venom glands, a triangular-shaped head. Their slit-shaped pupils can open wide to open most of the eye, or close almost completely. This helps them to see in a wide range of light levels. Vipers are nocturnal, meaning that they sleep in the day and wake up at night to go hunting. \nLike other snakes, vipers are predators, meaning that they eat other animals. Their main diet is birds (including bird eggs), amphibians, such as frogs and toads, and other small reptiles like lizards and smaller snakes.\nReproduction.\nMost viper species are ovoviviparous, giving birth to live young, but a few lay eggs. The word \"viper\" is derived from Latin \"vivo\" = \"I live\" and \"pario\" = \"I give birth\".\nWhere they live.\nViper snakes are found in Americas, Africa, Eurasia. In the Americas they live from southern Canada, through the United States, Mexico, Central America, and into South America. The only type of viper which lives in the United Kingdom are the adders.\nSubfamilies.\nType genus = \"Vipera\"\u2014Laurenti, 1768\nDiet.\nVipers are predators, meaning that they eat other animals, their main diet is eating birds (including bird eggs), amphibians, such as frogs and toads, and other small reptiles like lizards and other smaller snakes."}

It is the only venomous snake in the British Isles.\nThey are not highly dangerous: the snake is not aggressive and usually only bites when alarmed or disturbed. Bites can be very painful, but they are rarely fatal. The snake is not threatened, though it is protected in some countries.\nDescription.\nAdults grow to about 60 centimeters (24\u00a0in) in length. The largest, at around 90\u2013104 (35\u201341\u00a0in), are found in Scandinavia. In France and Great Britain, the maximum size is 80\u201387 centimeters (31\u201334\u00a0in), weighing from 50 grams (1.8\u00a0oz) to about 180 grams (6.3\u00a0oz).\nUnusually for snakes, the sexes can be seen by their colour. Females are usually brownish with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings.\nThe species has two morphs. The common pattern is the one with dark stripe with crossbars along the back, on a lighter body. The melanistic morph is very dark all over. The dark morph is more common in females. Polymorphism is usually maintained by natural selection.\nThe adder has a wide range. It lives in across Eurasian. \nIn several European countries it is the only native venomous snake.\nThe adder's diet is mainly small mammals such as mice, voles, shrews and even weasels and moles. Sometimes, they eat slow worms and lizards. They feed on amphibia, such as frogs, newts, and salamanders. There have been reports of adders eating birds, especially nestlings and eggs. Adders are ovoviviparous. Once they reach about 30\u00a0cm (1\u00a0ft) in length, their diet becomes adult.\nThey are protected by law in the U.K., (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981), and by the Berne Convention (the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). It is an offence to harm them."}

It is classified with the closely related \"Pederpes\" in the family Whatcheeriidae.\nDescription.\n\"Whatcheeria\" possesses a mixture of basal and derived (advanced) traits. Like other stem tetrapods it has a series of lateral lines across the skull, and rows of teeth on the palate These are basal traits derived from its lobe-finned fish ancestors.\nIt has a cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle that extends from the scapula. The cleithrum once attached to the skull in lobe-finned fish, the ancestors of tetrapods, but detached to allow the neck to move freely.\n\"Whatcheeria\" grew to about long. The skull is deep (this is an advanced trait) and the snout is pointed. A hole on the top of the skull behind the eyes called the parietal foramen is relatively large in \"Whatcheeria\". The bones on the skull surface are unusually smooth, unlike the pitted skulls of many other early tetrapods.\nClassification.\nWith modern cladistic taxonomy, Whatcheeriidae is not placed in Amphibia or any other class but simply as its own family within Tetrapoda. Its relationships with other tetrapods are left unclear."}

Leaders of the Democratic Labor Party held an emergency meeting at the party\u2019s Headquarters in George Street In Bridgetown on the morning of Thompson\u2019s death, during which Stuart was chosen as the next Prime Minister. \nStuart was sworn in as the 7th Prime Minister of Barbados and Minister for National Security, the public service and Urban Development the same day by Governor General Clifford Husbands. \nIn 2011, Stuart was appointed as a member of the UN Global Panel on Sustainability. \nStuart won his first election as Prime Minister on 21 February 2013, defeating Barbados Labour Party challenger (for his consituncy) Noel Lynch. \nOn 24 January 2014 Stuart became a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom which bestowed him the title of \u201cRight Honourable\u201d. \nStuart had announced changes for Barbados including his intention to turn Barbados into a republic and replace the Queen of Barbados with a ceremonial President as Head of state. On 22 March 2015, Stuart told a meeting of his Democratic Labour Party (Barbados): \u201cWe cannot pat ourselves on the shoulder at having gone into independence; having decolonized our Politics; we cannot pat ourselves on the shoulders at having decolonised our jurisprudence by delinking from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and explain to anybody why we continue to have a monarchical system. Therefore, the Right Excellent Errol Barrow decolonized the Politics; Owen Arthur decolonized the jurisprudence and Freundel Stuart is going to complete the process. \nThe genaral secretary of the Democratic Labour Party, George Pilgrim, confirmed the move and said that it is expected to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Barbadian independence in 2016. According to Pilgrim, the change will be implemented through a bill that will be presented to the Parliament of Barbados. \nAccording to the country\u2019s Constitution, a two-third majority in Parliament, both in the House of Assembly of Barbados and the Senate of Barbados must have a two-third of the ruling party. \nIn the event that Barbados becomes a republic, it will still retain its membership of the Commonwealth of Nations but the Queen of Barbados will be replaced in her presence with a ceremonial President as head of state. The position of Governor-General of Barbados will also be dissolved. "}

This park covers most of the wilderness areas in Tasmania's south west. The park is well known for its untouched wilderness and remoteness. Weather in the park is can change quickly, and can be severe. The area has not been changed by humans. Evidence shows that Tasmanian Aborigines have visited the area for at least 25,000 years. European settlers have made a few trips into the park, but there has been very few long lasting settlements and little change to the natural environment. Within the area there is only one road, to the hydroelectricity township of Strathgordon. The southern and western parts the park can only be reached by foot, boat, or light aircraft.\nThe tiny town of Melaleuca in the extreme south-west has a runway for airplanes to land, and basic facilities for the National Parks Service.\nHistory.\nMost of the park was created in 1955 and was first called Lake Pedder National Park. Over the following 35 years the park was made bigger and was renamed, reaching its present size in 1990. The original small Lake Pedder was flooded with the building of a dam on the Gordon River for hydroelectricity. The man made lake is also called Lake Pedder\nWildlife.\nThe Melaleuca area is the summer breeding grounds of the highly endangered orange-bellied parrot .\nAccess.\nThere are two ways to reach the park by land: the Gordon River Road to the hydroelectricity township of Strathgordon and the Huon Highway to Cockle Creek. The southern and western areas of the park can only be reached by foot, boat, or light aircraft.\nThere are two main walking tracks cross the park. The Port Davey Track and the South Coast Track. The walks are generally for more experienced walkers, and take about ten to fourteen days to complete. A flight to or from Melaleuca may be arranged to split the walk, or for tourist access for day trips. Several more difficult walks also exist, including the Eastern and Western Arthur Ranges, Precipitous Bluff, the South West Cape, and Federation Peak. These are not suitable for inexperienced walkers, or for people traveling alone.

It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, a famous German mathematician who wrote about this method, but did not invent it.\nTo perform Gaussian elimination, the coefficients of the terms in the system of linear equations are used to create a type of matrix called an augmented matrix. Then, elementary row operations are used to simplify the matrix. The three types of row operations used are:\nThe goal of Gaussian elimination is to get the matrix in \"row-echelon form\". If a matrix is in row-echelon form, that means that reading from left to right, each row will start with at least one more zero term than the row above it. Some definitions of Gaussian elimination say that the matrix result has to be in \"reduced row-echelon form\". That means that the matrix is in row-echelon form and the only non-zero term in each row is 1. Gaussian elimination that creates a reduced row-echelon matrix result is sometimes called Gauss-Jordan elimination.\nExample.\nSuppose the goal is to find the answers to this system of linear equations.\nFirst, the system needs to be turned into an augmented matrix. In an augmented matrix, each linear equation becomes a row. On one side of the augmented matrix, the coefficients of each term in the linear equation become numbers in the matrix. On the other side of the augmented matrix are the constant terms each linear equation is equal to. For this system, the augmented matrix is:\nThen, row operations can be done on the augmented matrix to simplify it. The table below shows the row reduction process on the system of equations and on the augmented matrix.\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. This is also called \"triangular form\".\nThe matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form. Reading this matrix tells us that the solutions for this system of equations occur when x = 2, y = 3, and z = -1."}

The band is named after the 1985 novel, Exodus by Leon Uris.\nTim Agnello was later replaced with Gary Holt who has stayed in the band since. Kirk Hammett left in 1983 to join now-famous thrash metal band Metallica, and was eventually replaced by Rick Hunolt. Carlton Melson was eventually replaced by Rob McKillop, with Keith Stewart being replaced by Paul Baloff. With these members They released their debut album, \"Bonded by Blood\", on April 25, 1985, which is considered by many listeners to be the band's best album.\nThey then fired Paul Baloff and replaced him with Steve 'Zetro' Souza, and released two more albums, Pleasures Of The Flesh and Fabulous Disaster until signing to a major label and replacing Tom Hunting with John Tempesta. The band then released the album Impact Is Imminent, which was considered a disappointing album compared to Fabulous Disaster. Rob McKillop was replaced with Michael Butler and the band then released Force Of Habit. The songs on this album were a little slower than their previous songs. After touring for this album, Exodus broke-up as thrash metal was becoming less popular.\nGary Holt and Rick Hunolt reformed Exodus in 1997 and brought back members Tom Hunting and Paul Baloff, as well as adding new member Jack Gibson. They played shows throughout the year and released a live album called Another Lesson In Violence, and broke up again in 1998.\nThe band reformed again in 2001 with the same members as the previous reunion. Paul Baloff died from a stroke in 2002. Some people believed Exodus would break up again because of this. Instead, Steve Souza was invited to rejoin the band, and they released the Tempo of The Damned album in 2004 with his vocals.\nOver a year, three members were replaced. Steve Souza left the band whilst they were touring in South America and was replaced with Rob Dukes. Rick Hunolt left to concentrate on his family life and was replaced with Lee Altus. Tom Hunting left due to nervous problems that made him leave in 1989 after the Fabulous Disaster album, and was replaced with Paul Bostaph.\nTheir first album since these replacements was Shovel Headed Kill Machine, in 2007, Paul Bostaph left and Tom Hunting returned to the band again, before releasing another album, The Atrocity Exhibition...Exhibit A. In 2008, the band re-recorded the songs from the Bonded By Blood album and released them on an album called Let There Be Blood. In 2010, the band released their next album, Exhibit B: The Human Condition.\nSteve Souza has recently replaced Rob Dukes after his departure in 2014, becoming their frontman indefinitely. With this lineup, the band released the Blood In Blood Out record in 2014. They are currently touring the world, with the end date scheduled at 11/26/16."}

She attended St. Paul's Girls' School and then continued school at Newham College in Cambridge. At Newham College she got a Ph.D in physical chemistry. She worked on coal, studies of RNA, and viruses. She was one of the first people to do X-ray crystallography on DNA. She also spent several years working in Paris studying crystals. [3] She discovered the size, shape, and arrangement of molecules. She dedicated her life to discovering more about molecules. \nIn 1951, she moved to London. She joined a group of scientific researchers at King's College. Her assignment was to take pictures of DNA. She looked at the structure and function of DNA in the pictures. This job was very difficult because technology was simple at that time. During this job, Franklin worked with a man named Raymond Gosling. He was also trying to photograph the DNA. Franklin also had to work with Maurice Wilkins. The scientists had many arguments, but Franklin kept working. Instead of working with Wilkins, Franklin liked to work with Gosling. She created X-ray pictures that showed that DNA is shaped like a double helix.\nIn 1951, Franklin presented her idea about the shape of DNA at a conference. A biologist named James D. Watson went to her conference. Watson and Francis Crick were biologists. They were also studying the shape of DNA. They were building 3D examples of the helix shape. \u00a0\nWatson and Crick used Franklin's work in their work to discover the structure of DNA. Their final model was presented in 1953.

Hera was known for her jealous and vengeful nature. Always suspicious of Zeus, she mistook Echo to be the object of his uncouth affections. She cast a spell on the unfortunate nymph - from this day forward Echo would only be able to repeat the last words addressed to her and never speak her own again. \nNarcissus, a hunter from Boeotia, got separated from his hunting companions one day in the woods. Echo, being a nymph and also feeling pitiful because of her curse, had been wandering those same woods. The moment she saw Narcissus walking through the forest, she fell in love with him and his breathtaking beauty. But because of Hera's curse, she was unable to tell him, so she followed the boy and waited for him to speak. Eventually, Narcissus began to call for his companions. Echo eagerly stepped out of the trees and repeated the words. A confusing and repetitive exchange ensued, ending with Narcissus shouting to his companions that they should come together. Mistaking this for an invitation, Echo repeated his words and leapt towards Narcissus. However, at that moment, Narcissus decided he'd rather die before letting a wood nymph have him, and pushed her away. Echo, heartbroken, ran away and hid in a cave, not eating or sleeping, just pining for Narcissus. \nNemesis, the goddess of revenge, punished Narcissus for not accepting the unrequited love of Echo. Nemesis caused him to fall in love with his own reflection he saw in a pool near the cave where Echo had died. Narcissus refused to leave the reflection of himself and, like Echo, starvation was going to claim him. But not before he cried out to his reflection: \"Farewell, dear boy. Beloved in vain.\". Echo's voice repeated \"farewell\" from the cave and Narcissus died by the bank of the pool. \nAfter some time, Echo began to grow thin from starvation until her body withered away entirely into dust, leaving nothing but her voice. To this day Echo's voice still calls back from caves and labyrinths, repeating the last spoken words forever. And thus ends the story of echo and Narcissus."}

She was born in Brooklyn, New York City. She starred several movies including \"Heaven Can Wait\", \"Laura\", \"Leave Her to Heaven\", \"The Razor's Edge\", \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\", \"Whirlpool\", \"The Mating Season\" and \"The Left Hand of God\". \nEarly life.\nTierney was born on 19 November 1920. She was born into a wealthy Brooklyn family. On a family vacation she toured the Warner Brothers studio and was spotted by director Anatole Litvak. After a screen test she was offered a contract. But her father disapproved of her becoming a Hollywood actress. He finally approved of her acting on the Broadway stage if she would first make her society debut. She played several bit parts before again being noticed by Hollywood. She had a brief contract with Columbia Pictures but returned to Broadway. Her first break was in the play \"The Male Animal\" as a college cheerleader. This time 20th Century Fox wanted to sign her to a contract. They allowed her creative control over her parts and she could return to act on Broadway every year.\nHollywood.\nShe played a newspaperwoman in love with an outlaw (played by Henry Fonda) in the Western \"The Return of Frank James\". She was then cast in a variety of roles before getting top billing on her own. Her first lead role came in the movie \"Heaven can Wait\" also starring Don Ameche. She then starred in the Film noir \"Laura\". This was followed by a second film noir, \"Leave her to Heaven\". Starring with Tyrone Power, she played the female lead in \"The Razor's Edge\". Probably her best known film was \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" with Rex Harrison. When it was released in 1947 it did fairly well. But it did not become a classic until later. She went on to star in several films. But she had a number of personal problems later in her career. This included a love affair gone wrong. As her second husband, she married W. Howard Lee, a rich Houston oilman. She remained happily married to him for 20 years until his death in 1981.\nRetirement in Houston.\nAfter her marriage to Howard she did only two more films before retiring. Tierney's autobiography was published in 1979. As an actor she had been a heavy smoker, probably to lower her voice. On 6 November 1991 Tierney died of emphysema in Houston, Texas. She is buried in Glenwood Cemetery in Houston, next to her husband, W. Howard Lee. "}

It is between the cerebral cortex and midbrain.\nIt relays sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex, and regulates consciousness, sleep, and alertness.\nThe thalamus sits above the hypothalamus, and below the cerebral cortex. It is a collection of nuclei with various functions. It acts as a relay station, gathering sense information of all kinds (except olfactory) and passes it on to the cerebral cortex.\nThere are action systems for several types of behaviour, including eating, drinking, defecation, and copulation. These behaviours satisfy short-term needs, and are called 'consummatory' behaviours.\nMain functions.\nThe thalamus has many functions. First of all, it acts as a relay station, or hub. It relays information between subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. In particular, every sensory system except smelling has a thalamic nucleus that receives sensory signals and sends them to the related areas in the cortex. For example, for sight, inputs from the retina are sent to the thalamus, which in turn sends them to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe.\nThe thalamus is believed to process sensory information as well as to relay it: each of the main sensory relay areas gets strong feedback from the cerebral cortex. \nThe thalamus also plays an important role in regulating states of sleep and wakefulness. Thalamic nuclei have strong connections with the cerebral cortex. These circuits are believed to be involved with consciousness. The thalamus plays a major role in regulating arousal, the level of awareness, and activity. Damage to the thalamus can lead to permanent coma.\nThe thalamus has a role in the basal ganglia system but this is poorly understood. The thalamus has been thought of as a \"relay\" that just forwards signals to the cerebral cortex. But research suggests that thalamus is more selective. Many different functions are linked to regions of the thalamus. This is the case for most sensory systems (except the olfactory system), such as the auditory, somatic sensory system, visceral, eating and visual systems. There specific lesions cause specific sensory deficits. A big role of the thalamus is to support the motor and language systems. Much of the circuitry for these systems is shared with the thalamus. The thalamus is \"functionally connected\" to the hippocampus. This is part of the hippocampal system which is crucial for human episodic event memory.\nThe information for motor control is a network involving the thalamus as a subcortical motor center. In the brains of primates, the thalamus provides the specific channels from the basal ganglia and cerebellum to the cortical motor areas. In an investigation of the eye movement motor response in three monkeys, the thalamic regions were found to cause antisaccade eye-movement. That is the ability to inhibit the reflexive jerking movement of the eyes in the direction of a presented stimulus. They still look in the direction of the stimulus, but do so in a more controlled manner.\nRecent research suggests that the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus may \"amplify the connectivity (signaling strength) of just the circuits in the cortex needed for the current context. This helps the flexibility (of the mammalian brain) to make complex decisions by wiring the many associations on which decisions depend into weakly connected cortical circuits\". Researchers founds that \"enhancing MD activity magnified the ability of mice to \"think\". This lowered by more than 25 percent their error rate in deciding which conflicting sensory stimuli to follow to find the reward\".\nIn short, the thalamus helps to make mammals more effective at making decisions and living in their natural environment.\nThe half-second delay.\nThe thalamus is a key area which is involved in what is known as the \"half-second delay\". This is a perceptual illusion which has only recently been discovered. The discovery is as follows: we perceive events in the world as instantaneous. They happen when we see (hear, sense) them happening. But the processing of visual signals at least is what the thalamus does. Experientially, we see events happening (so we think) without any delay. But in reality \"it takes half a second for the brain to organise the data\" which comes in from, let us say, vision. But we do not sense that half-second delay at all. Our perception of events is that we see them as they happen.\nAll this applies to consciousness and conscious behaviour. Automatic responses to sudden pain happen instantaneously (bare foot on a pin for example). But they are consciously perceived later."}

Many consider Saint Vitus to be an influential doom metal band which helped start the genre in the late 1970s and early 1980s, along with their contemporaries Pentagram, Witchfinder General, Trouble and Candlemass.\nHistory.\nSaint Vitus formed in Los Angeles, California in 1978. Their original lineup was Scott Reagers (vocals), Dave Chandler (guitarist), Mark Adams (drums) and Armando Acosta (drums). Saint Vitus was known as Tyrant until 1980, when they changed their name to their current name Saint Vitus, which was inspired by the song \"St. Vitus' Dance\" by Black Sabbath, a band they have cited as one of their major influences.\nAround 1983, Greg Ginn of Black Flag signed Saint Vitus to his label SST Records and the band managed to record their first album, which is self-titled. It came out in 1984, and later that year, the embarked on their first-ever tour with Black Flag, another band that Saint Vitus is influenced by and would latercover their song \"Thirsty and Miserable\" for their 1987 EP with the same title. Their second album \"Hallow's Victim\" and the \"The Walking Dead\" EP were both released in 1985.\nSaint Vitus experienced their first lineup change when Scott \"Wino\" Weinrich replaced Reagers on vocals in 1986. They would achieve moderate success with the next three albums, including \"Born Too Late\", which has been cited as their best-selling release, but they were never able to become a popular band. Weinrich eventually left the band in 1991 to focus on the reunion of The Obsessed, which was his band before he joined Saint Vitus. He was replaced by Chritus Linderson, who sang on \"C.O.D.\" (1992), the sixth Saint Vitus studio album, before he left the band.\nIn 1994, Saint Vitus reunited with their original singer Scott Reagers. With him, the band recorded their seventh studio album \"Die Healing\" (1995) and then broke up in 1996. The band reunited twice, in 2003 and 2008, with the \"Born Too Late\" lineup. After 31 years in the band, Acosta left Saint Vitus in 2009 and was replaced by Henry Vasquez. This new incarnation recently completed a new album, entitled \"Lillie: F-65\", which was released on April 27, 2012.\nDiscography.\nSaint Vitus' full-length studio albums include:\nTheir other recordings include \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Thirsty and Miserable\" EPs (released in 1985 and 1987 respectively), the live album \"Live\" (1990) and the compilation album \"Heavier Than Thou\" (1991)."}

Bobby Jarzombek has been their drummer since 2007, but only plays live with them.\nFates Warning has released a total of ten studio albums. Other than the studio albums, they have released two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS, three DVDs (each of them features live concerts) and four demo tapes. Their two first albums were not very successful. Their next album, \"Awaken the Guardian\", became a mainstream success and peaked at number #191 on the \"Billboard\" 200.

{"id": "346631", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346631", "title": "Australian green tree frog", "text": "The Australian green tree frog (green tree frog in Australia, White's tree frog, or dumpy tree frog), \"Litoria caerulea\", is a species of tree frogs. They live in Australia and New Guinea. \nThe green tree frog was imported onto ships to the United States and New Zealand. The species belongs to the genus \"Litoria\". The species magnificent tree frog (\"Litoria splendida\") and the giant tree frog (\"Litoria infrafrenata\") are similar to the green tree frog. The green tree frog is the largest frog in Australia. It can reach to 10 centimeters (4 inches) in length. \nThe average lifespan is about sixteen years, if kept captive. Green tree frogs are easy to take care of. They are okay with living near human buildings. They are often found on windows or inside houses. The green tree frog screams when it is in danger. It does this to scare off animals that have threatened them. The green tree frog squeaks when it is touched. The green tree frog is known as the most recognizable frog in Australia. This is because of how the frog looks like and because of its behavior in its habitat. It is also a popular exotic pet throughout the world. The frog's skin has antibacterial and antiviral protections. Their skin may be useful for medication in treating patients in the future.\nTaxonomy.\nThe green tree frog is one of many tree frog species of the genus \"Litoria\". They are native in Australasia. The common name of the species is \"White's tree frog\". The species were named after John White. He first described the species in 1790. The green tree frog was the first frog to be classified in Australia. The specimen of the green tree frog was collected by Sir Joseph Banks. It was destroyed during the German bombing of the Hunterian Museum during World War II. The museum was located at the Royal College of Surgeons in London.\nThe green tree frog was first called the \"blue frog\" (\"Rana caerulea\"). The original specimens White sent to England were damaged by the preservative and looked blue. The color of the frog is caused by blue and green pigments covered in a yellow layer. The preservative destroyed the yellow layer. It left the frog looking blue. The word \"caeruela\", which means blue in Latin, is part of the green tree frog's scientific name. The frog is also more known as the \"green tree frog\". However, that name is often given to the larger green tree frog (\"Hyla cinerea\") in its region.\nDescription.\nThe green tree frog can reach 10\u00a0centimeters (4\u00a0inches) in length. The frog's color depends on the temperature and the color of its environment. The green tree frog can be brown or green. The frog's mouth is white. The frog may have small, white-shaped spots on its back. At the end of its toes, it has large discs. This gives the frog the ability to climb. The eyes are golden. The fingers of the frog have webbed feet for swimming. The tympanum membrane can be seen on the frog. \nThe green tree frog looks similar to the magnificent tree frog (\"Litoria spendida\"). This frog is native to north-western Australia. The magnificent tree frog has large patrotoid and rostral glands on the head. The giant tree frog (\"Litoria infrafrenata\") is also sometimes confused with the green tree frog. The giant tree frog has white stripes. These stripes are on the edge of the frog's lower jaw. The green tree frog does not have these stripes.\nThe appearance of the green tree frog tadpole changes during its development. The tadpole can reach from 8.1 millimeters (after it has hatched) to 44 millimeters. The tadpole is brown, but it later changes to green during its development. The underside of the tadpole is dark. It changes to white when the tadpole is an adult frog. The eggs are brown, in a clear jelly. They are 1.1\u20131.4 millimeters in diameter. \nThe green tree frog has lungs. They absorb oxygen through their skin. For this to happen, their skin has to be moist. However, their skin can get infected by pathogens. Pathogens will live on the frog's skin. This makes them sick. The frog will then grow peptides. These will destroy the pathogens. The skin of the Green Tree Frog has caerins. Caerins is a group of peptides with antibacterial and antivirial protection. It also has caerulins. The caerulins have physiological effects. The CCK-8 is a digestive hormone and hunger suppressant. Several peptides from the skin of the green tree frog have been found to destroy HIV without harming healthy T-cells.\nDistribution.\nThe green tree frog is native to northern and eastern parts of Australia. They are also native to southern New Guinea. In New Guinea, the green tree frog lives in the drier area of the country. The frog can be found from Irian Jaya to Port Moresby. It also can be found on Daru Island. There has been records of the frog found in northern New Guinea. However, it is thought that they were introduced there by humans. The International Conservation Union (IUCN) believes the frog is in \"scattered locations\" in both New Guinea and Indonesia.\nThe species has been introduced to the United States and New Zealand. The frog can be found in the US state of Florida. It is believed that they were introduced through pet trade. There are only small populations in Florida. It is unknown if they have caused any ecological damage. In New Zealand, there were large populations of the green tree frog. However, there have been no sightings since the 1950s.\nEcology, behavior and life history.\nGreen Tree Frogs are easy to take care of. They are active at night. During the day, they will rest near a place where it is cool, dark, and moist. In the winter, green tree frogs do not make calling sounds. They are also not seen that much.\nDepending on their location, green tree frogs will live in several habitats. They are found in the canopy of trees. They are also found near slow-moving waters. They can also live in swamps or in the grasslands in cooler climates. green tree frogs are known to live inside houses. They can be found in sinks and toilets. They can also be found on windows. They will also live in tanks, downpipes, and gutters. They like living in those places because they provide high humidity. The habitats can also be cooler than their environment. The frogs will be near downpipes and tanks during mating season. They do this because the tools will make their call louder.\nThe species' call is a low, slow \"Brawk-Brawk-Brawk\". They repeat it many times. For most of the year, they will call while being on top of something that is very high. These include trees and gutters. During mating season, the frogs will call near a place where there is water. They will stay there for a little while or forever. Like many frogs, green tree frogs call to attract a mate. They will also use their call to warn other frogs that they are near. The green tree frog will make a stress call whenever they are in danger.\nThe green tree frogs will eat insects and spiders. However, they can also eat smaller frogs and even small mammals. The frog's teeth are not made for cutting up their prey. This means that the prey has to fit inside their mouths in order for the frog to eat it. Many frogs will stick out their tongues at prey. The green tree frog's tongues, as with many frogs, are very sticky. The prey will be stuck and will be eaten. The green tree frog will use their tongues on small prey. For larger prey, they will jump on top of it and force it into their mouths using their hands.\nThe frog has a few predators. They include snakes, a few species of lizards and birds. Dogs and cats have also been known to catch and eat Green Tree Frogs. The green tree frog can live up to sixteen years, if kept captive. But some have been known to live for over twenty years. The average life expectancy in the wild is lower than being captive. This is because of predation.\nAs a pet.\nThe green tree frog is one of the most popular pet frogs in the world. This is because of its submissive behavior and long life expectancy. It is also a popular pet frog because it looks like a cartoon frog. It is also one of the easiest frogs to take care of. Their diet are not expensive. They also have a strong resistance to diseases. Overfeeding the frog is a common problem with pet owners. The green tree frog tends to become obese when it is overfed. In the wild, the frog's energy is needed for the frog to catch its prey. However, in captivity, they are given live food. They are also housed in comfortable habitats. This makes the frog lazy because it does not have to do any activities. When the frog is inactive, it will gain weight. An overweight green tree frog will have fat layers on top of the head and body. This gives it a \"dumpy\" look. This is why some pet owners call the green tree frog the \"dumpy tree frog\".\nConservation.\nAccording to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the green tree frog is protected in Australia. The IUCN lists the frog as \"least concern\". It is listed as \"least concern\" because the green tree frog can be found in many places. The Green Tree Frog's population is not declining.\nSome of the green tree frog's natural habitats have been destroyed. Some Green Tree Frogs have been found to be infected with chytrid fungus. This causes chytridiomycosis. The population of the green tree frog in Australia is declining. However, because of the long life expectancy of this species, it will take longer for the frog to be an endangered species."}

The \"Nationals\", which now number 22 events every year, are the major events in drag racing that bring together the best cars and drivers from across North America. The Mac Tools U.S. Nationals are now held at Indianapolis Raceway Park in Clermont, Indiana. \nSafety.\nThe NHRA forces racers to use various things in the cars run in its racing events to keep drivers safe. First is the five point safety harness (belt) that all cars must have. This holds the driver secure in the seat and has with a quick-release lock, which can be opened in less than a second if the driver needs to leave the car due to fire or explosion.\nSecond are the fire suits that all drivers must wear. These suits are full body cover-alls and made with seven layers of Nomex fire-resistant fabric. \nThird is the use of the Head and Neck Support (HANS) device. This device limits the moving of the head and neck in the event of a collision and has been required within the NHRA since 2004.\nFourth is the high-strength metal shield that must be placed behind the head of all Top Fuel drivers. This is to prevent any material from entering the cockpit and striking the driver. This is needed because the engine is behind the driver in Top Fuel cars.\nFifth is the on board fire control system that all cars must have. These systems are directed onto the engine itself and start when the engine catches fire, reducing the chance for the car to completely catch fire. This has been in place on all cars beginning in 1983, when an engine explosion and fire came very close to killing then-Funny Car driver Mike Dunn.\nSixth is the roof escape opening that is in place on all Funny Cars since the division was made in the early 1970s. This opening allows Funny Car drivers a safe means of escape during an engine fire rather than falling out of the car between the frame and body.\nSeventh are the long bars at the end of all cars, also known as \"wheelie bars\". These prevent the car from turning over during the rapid start of the race. \nThe drive tires of the cars, which are called \"slicks\" because there is no tread on them, are made from a much harder compound so that the tires are resistant to failure. The tires are not allowed to be inflated under for any race at any time.\nCars in the Funny Car class must have fire-proof engine blankets around the engine block to contain material in case of an engine explosion.\nBefore the late 1980s, people could station themselves up to the guardrails so they could be closer to the action. After several rather accidents on track, where people have been hurt or killed, people are no longer allowed within of the guardrail."}

The music video was the first to be shown on MTV in the United States of America at 12:01 on 1 August 1981. \nFollowing the poor success of their second album, \"Adventures in Modern Recording\", the group broke up in 1981. \nBiography.\nHorn and Downes first met in the mid 1970s, at auditions for Tina Charles' backing band, and worked with her producer, Biddu, whose backing tracks had inspired their early work. Trevor Horn said that the group was originally planned to be named \"The Bugs\": \"The Bugs were studio insects\u2014imaginary creatures who lived in recording studios creating havoc. Then somebody said as a joke that The Bugs would never be as big as The Beatles. So we changed it to The Buggles.\"\nThe Buggles' first hit, \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", was released in September 1979 and was the 444th number one in the UK charts, spending one week at the top, as well as reaching number one on the singles charts of fifteen other countries Hans Zimmer worked for \"Video Killed the Radio Star, and makes a brief appearance in the video.\nDownes and Horn worked on their second album, \"Adventures in Modern Recording\". As originally intended, \"I Am a Camera\" was brought to completion as a Buggles song under its original title. However, Downes left the group during the recording of the album to form the band Asia with former Yes bandmate Steve Howe. Horn completed the album with a lot of new songwriting partners and musicians. \"Adventures in Modern Recording\" was released in late 1981, but five singles released from the album (\"I Am a Camera\", \"Adventures in Modern Recording\", \"On TV\", \"Lenny\" and \"Beatnik\") were not as successful as \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", resulting in the end of The Buggles."}

Some pit vipers are arboreal (meaning they live in trees), some are terrestrial (meaning they live on the ground), and one species is even semi-aquatic: the cottonmouth, \"Agkistrodon piscivorus\".\nWhere they live.\nThis subfamily of snakes is found from eastern Europe, eastward through Asia to Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. In the Americas, they are found from southern Canada, southward to Central America to southern South America. Members of this group are found in deserts and rainforests.\nReproduction.\nPit vipers are mainly viviparous, meaning the females give live birth. It is believed that all oviparous Pit vipers guard their eggs. Many young pit vipers have brightly coloured tails which is different to the rest of their body."}

It suggests that four bodily fluids affect human personality traits and behaviour. The temperaments are \"sanguine\", \"choleric\", \"melancholy\", and \"phlegmatic\".\nHumours.\nGalen, a doctor from the Roman empire added characteristics to bodily fluids:\nGalen thought that to cure illness you need to rebalance the fluids. If you, for example, have too much blood, you will need a remedy which is the opposite of warm and damp; something cold and dry.\nPersonalities.\nSanguine.\nA sanguine person is an energetic person. They are friendly, talkative, encouraging and creative. They like to be noticed by others and to have fun.\nBut they tend to forget things they are supposed to do and to be late for dates or appointments. If they feel that they are not appreciated, they can become depressed (sad). They tend to lose interest in new hobbies as soon as it is no longer a fun thing to do.\nCholeric.\nA choleric is a bossy, ambitious and critical person. They tend to be good leaders, but when they don't have power over everyone, they can get into a bad mood.\nThey can be bossy to people of the other temperaments. They are able to make good plans and do things well by not losing interest.\nMelancholy.\nA melancholic or melancholy person is a thinker and perfectionist. They tend to prefer to spend time alone instead of being in social situations. They go by a schedule and are truthful (say what they mean). They can become depressed because of their perfectionist traits. They might suffer in silence and not complain. They are independent and able to do things for themselves. Melancholics can be creative in artistic areas such as poetry and music.\nPeople tend to say \"Melancholic\" instead of \"Melancholy\". The term \"Melancholic\" in the incorrect way of saying one of these four traits.\nPhlegmatic.\nA phlegmatic is a quiet, kind and peaceful person. They like giving and receiving affection, although they might be shy. They can be content to go along with situations as they are, instead of trying to change them. They may tend to be relaxed, lazy and not have a lot of energy."}

She was orphaned at an early age. She had, by the standard of Russian ballet, little formal training. Tutored by Mikhail Fokine, she made her debut in 1908. This was a single private performance of Oscar Wilde's \"Salom\u00e9\", in which she stripped nude in the course of the \"Dance of the Seven Veils\".\nCareer.\nSergei Diaghilev took her with the Ballets Russes and she danced the title role of \"Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre\" in the Paris season of 1909, and Zob\u00e9ide in \"Scheherazade\" in 1910. Both ballets were choreographed by Fokine, and designed by Leon Bakst. Her partner in \"Scherazade\" was Nijinsky. \"Scherezade\" was admired at the time for its racy sensuality, costumes and design. Its music is by Rimsky-Korsakov. For a long time the ballet was rarely performed. It is in the repertoire of the Mariinsky Ballet at present, and was performed by them in London 2011. Rubinstein left the Ballets Russes in 1911.\nBisexual, in 1911 Rubinstein began a three-year affair with the painter Romaine Brooks, who created a striking portrait. She used the dancer as a nude model for Venus.\nRubinstein companies.\nAfter leaving the Ballets Russes, Rubinstein formed her own dance company. She had inherited money, and she used it to commission several lavish productions. In 1911 she performed in \"Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien\". The creative team was Fokine (choreography); Bakst (design); and score by Debussy. This was a triumph for its stylized modernism, and a scandal. The Archbishop of Paris prohibited Catholics from attending because St. Sebastian was being played by a woman and a Jew.\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Rubinstein appeared in a number of plays, and in Staat's \"Istar\" at the Paris Opera in 1924. Between 1928 and 1929, she directed her own company in Paris with Nijinska as choreographer. She commissioned and performed in Maurice Ravel's \"Bol\u00e9ro\" in 1928. Other works developed in 1928 were Massine's \"David\", with music by Sauguet; and \"Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e\", with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Nijinska. The repertoire also included The Firebird (\"L'Oiseau de Feu\") with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Fokine; this had been one of the most sensational creations for the Ballets Russes. Her company was revived in 1931 and 1934, with new works. She closed the company in 1935, and gave her last performance in the play \"Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher\" in Paris, 1939.\nRubinstein often staged free ballet events and continued to dance until the start of the Second World War.\nLater life.\nRubinstein was not a front-rank ballerina; she began her training too late for that. She did have tremendous 'stage presence' and was able to act. She was also a significant patron, and commissioned works that suited her, works that mixed dance with drama and stagecraft. In 1934 the French government awarded her the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and then in 1939 the Grand Cross of the order, their highest honour. In 1935 she was awarded honorary French citizenship, and in 1936 she converted to Roman Catholicism.\nIn 1940 she left France and made her way to England via Algeria and Morocco. There she helped wounded Free French soldiers until 1944. She returned to France after the war. She lived finally at \"Les Olivades\" at Vence, where she died in 1960. She is buried nearby."}

SIDS is sometimes referred to as cot death or crib death. \nThe name is only applied to cases where the baby is less than one year old. By definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year. Most happen when the infant is 2 to 4 months of age. This is a critical period because the infant's ability to arouse from sleep is not yet mature. SIDS is defined as a syndrome.\nBabies are at the highest risk for SIDS during their sleep. Male infants die more often than female infants; about 60% of the cases are male infants. Infants also die more often during winter months. \nThe reason for SIDS are unknown, but there are different theories:\nInfanticide and child abuse cases may be misdiagnosed as SIDS due to lack of evidence. and caretakers of infants with SIDS are sometimes falsely accused. Accidental suffocations are also sometimes misdiagnosed as SIDS and \"vice versa\". Grief support for families affected by SIDS is particularly important. The death of the infant is typically sudden, without witnesses, and requires an investigation.\nA broader term, \u201csudden and unexpected infant death\u201d (SUID) is used to describe \"all such deaths, regardless of cause\". Cases of SUID that remain unexplained after a complete autopsy and review of the circumstances of death and clinical history are classified as SIDS. Thus, SIDS is one of the causes of SUID and accounts for 80% of such deaths.\nRisk factors.\nNobody knows what causes SIDS. However, there are some known risk factors for SIDS.\nNot every infant who has one of these risk factors dies from SIDS. Risk factors just make it more likely for a baby to have SIDS.\nTobacco smoke.\nSIDS happens more in infants of mothers who smoke while they are pregnant. The higher the levels of nicotine in the infant's blood, the higher the risk of SIDS. Nicotine causes important changes in the way a fetus develops during pregnancy, which have been linked to SIDS as well as miscarriages.\nSleeping.\nInfants who are put to sleep on their stomachs or sides are more likely to die of SIDS. This risk is highest in infants who are two to three months old. The \"Back to Sleep\" movement has encouraged parents to put their infants to sleep on their backs to prevent SIDS. \nOther things that increase the risk for SIDS while an infant is sleeping include: \nSome researchers think these things can make it difficult for infants to control their body temperature, making them unable to control their breathing.\nInfants are more likely to die of SIDS if they share a bed with parents or older children. This risk is highest:\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that if parents share a room with an infant without sharing a bed, they can cut their infant's risk of SIDS in half.\nBreastfeeding.\nInfants who are breastfed are less likely to die of SIDS. The more an infant has been breastfed, the less likely they are to die of SIDS.\nPregnancy and infant factors.\nSIDS is less likely to happen in infants of older mothers. Infants of teenage mothers are at the highest risk. \nAn infant is also at a higher risk of SIDS if:\nAge.\nSIDS only happens at certain ages. The risk of SIDS is highest in infants from two to four months old. After the infant reaches one year old, the risk decreases and eventually reaches zero.\nGenetics.\nGenetics affect the risk of SIDS. Baby boys have about a 50% higher risk of SIDS than baby girls. Scientists think this might be because of an allele that exists on the X chromosome. They think this allele helps protect against episodes where the brain does not get enough oxygen (transient cerebral anoxia). Baby boys would be more likely to be missing this allele.\nScientists think that about 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are caused by inherited defects in the ion channels that help the heart squeeze out blood.\nOther.\nThe risk of SIDS seems to be affected by things like how much education an infant's mother got, race, ethnicity, and poverty.\nVaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS. Most studies have shown that getting vaccinations cuts an infant's risk of a SIDS death in half.\nSIDS may be more common in babies with \"Staphylococcus aureus\" or \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\") infections, but scientists are not sure.\nPreventing SIDS.\nSleep positioning.\nPutting infants to sleep on their backs can help prevent SIDS. The number of SIDS deaths has fallen in countries where this is commonly done. Also, if parents share a room with their infant but do not share a bed, they can cut their baby's risk of SIDS in half.\nBedding.\nParents can help prevent SIDS by not using pillows, very soft mattresses, stuffed animals, or fluffy blankets in their infant's crib. Dressing the infant warmly and keeping the crib \"naked\" lowers the risk of SIDS.\nIf an infant has a blanket in the crib, they should be covered only up to their chest, with their arms left outside the blanket. This makes it harder for the infant to move the blanket over their head, which could cause breathing problems.\nIn colder places where infants need help staying warm, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests using a \"sleep sack.\" This is like a sleeping bag for a baby, but with holes for the baby's arms and head. The bag is closed around the baby with a zipper. This helps keep the baby warm without covering their head. Sleep sacks are especially helpful for babies with low birth weight, who have more trouble keeping themselves warm.\nVaccination.\nMany studies have shown that vaccines normally given to infants help prevent SIDS. For example, one very large research study showed that giving infants vaccines for diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis helps prevent SIDS.\nGetting normal infant vaccines cuts infants' risk of SIDS in half, according to many studies."}

The remainder of the group announced that they continue recording their fourth album. Lopes had recorded a few verses before she was killed.\nThe album, \"3D\" was released later that year. The single \"Girl Talk\" was a tribute to Lopes. The other single \"Hands Up\" was not successful. The album's third single \"Damaged\" was more successful and was on the Hot 100 until 2003. In 2004, the reality television show \"R U The Girl?\" aired on FOX. The show was about searching for great African American singers. The show had over 4,000,000 average viewers. O'so Krispie from Atlanta was chosen as the winner.

The band was formed in 1989 by vocalist and lead guitarist Page Hamilton, who is their only constant member. \nHelmet became popular when they released their 1992 major-label debut \"Meantime\", which peaked at number 68 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and featured their best known songs \"Unsung\" and \"In the Meantime\". \"Meantime\" is also Helmet's only album to go gold in the United States. They made two more albums before breaking up in 1998. However, Helmet reformed in 2004 and released a new album later that year. The album was called \"Size Matters\" and was their last release on their longtime label Interscope Records. Helmet was briefly signed to Warcon Records, who released their next album \"Monochrome\" in 2006, but today, they are signed to Work Song Records.

They started in 1987 as Katzenjammer, became Sons of Kyuss in 1989 and then changed their name to Kyuss in 1991. The band now performs as Vista Chino.\nKyuss was considered guitarist Josh Homme's band before their 1995 breakup.\nCareer.\nThe band was formed in 1987 and its first name was \"Katzenjammer\" (A German slang word for \"hangover\") but changed this to Sons of Kyuss in 1989 and recorded an EP. This EP is the only release by the band that features bass player Chris Cockrell.\nAfter Chris Cockrell left, Nick Oliveri (who played guitar in the band when they were called \"Katzenjammer\") replaced him and the band shortened their name to \"Kyuss\".\nAfter performing shows in the Palm Desert area and gaining fans, the band signed to Dali records and released their first album \"Wretch\" in 1991. The band were unhappy with the album, as it didn't sound the way they wanted it to, because it wasn't produced properly and not enough money was spent on making it.\nIn 1992, the band hired a new producer who would be more capable to making their next album sound how the band wanted it to. This next album was called Blues For The Red Sun. It was more successful than Wretch and is considered their best album. However, bassist Nick Oliveri left after the band finished recording the album, and Scott Reeder became his replacement.\nWhen Dali Records had problems with money, the band signed to Elektra (a bigger label) and recorded another album. The album is supposed to be called \"Kyuss\" but fans call it \"Welcome To Sky Valley\" because of the sign on the front cover. Like Blues For The Red Sun, the album was successful, although it took over a year for the album to be brought out due to the band changing record labels. Drummer Brant Bjork left shortly after it was recorded as well, and was replaced with Alfredo Hernandez.\nIn 1995, the band released the last album of their initial run, called ...And The Circus Leaves Town. The album wasn't quite as successful as the previous two and fans and critics had mixed opinions of it. After the band broke up later that year, people started to respect the album more.\nFor several years after the breakup, people wondered if the band would ever reform. Guitar player Josh Homme (who had formed a band called Queens Of The Stone Age since the breakup) was unhappy with the idea of it, believing it would be wrong after a \"great history\" they had between 1987-1995. However, bass player Scott Reeder believed the other members of the band would be happy to reunite.\nEventually, in 2010, A Kyuss reunion had begun. However, Josh Homme still didn't agree with a reunion, so guitar player Bruno Fevery replaced him, playing with singer John Garcia, bass player Nick Oliveri, and drummer Brank Bjork as \"Kyuss Lives!\". John Garcia decided to go with this name as he believes there is not a \"Kyuss\" without Josh Homme.\nBecause of a lawsuit filed by Homme, Kyuss Lives! changed their name to Vista Chino. Nick Oliveri has since left again to be replaced by Billy Cordell. Vista Chino released their debut album \"Peace\" in September 2013.\nDiscography.\nSo far, the band has released five full-length studio albums, all released as Kyuss unless otherwise noted.

Another reason is that it releases the chemicals the ants make onto the bird's feathers. The bird can then eat the ant without being hurt by the chemicals.\nThere are two forms of anting: active anting and passive acting. Active anting is when a bird picks up ants in its bill and wipes them on its feathers. Passive anting is when the bird lies down in a group of ants and opens up its wings so that the ants will crawl up into its feathers."}

Potentiometers are resistors where the resistance can be changed using a knob or a slider.

Some are used in voltage dividers.\nThe idea of a device that could be used to control the amount of electricity going to a component was thought by many people, but the carbon potentiometer we commonly use today was invented by Thomas Edison in 1872 at the age of 25. He called this device a \"coiled resistance wire rheostat\". His patent for this device was issued in 1872. Carbon resistors, as said above, are the most commonly used resistors today. They are used in radios to control the volume, in televisions to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response. \nDifferent types.\nThere are many different types of potentiometers. These different types include carbon potentiometers, plastic potentiometers, and wire potentiometers. Carbon potentiometers are the most common potentiometers that we use today because they are inexpensive to make and are easy to put together. Wire potentiometers are the most powerful type out of the three listed above. The wire inside the potentiometer is wound so that it has more power. Plastic potentiometers have the same amount of power that carbon potentiometers do, but are of a higher quality. They are made of a special kind of plastic that conducts electricity just as effectively as carbon potentiometers. It as a better life than carbon potentiometers do. Trimmer potentiometers are small.

The movie, distributed by United Artists, stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, an Italian-American middleweight boxer whose self-destructive and obsessive rage, sexual jealousy, and animalistic appetite destroyed his relationship with his wife and family. Also featured in the film are Joe Pesci as Joey, LaMotta's well-intentioned brother and manager who tries to help Jake battle his inner demons, and Cathy Moriarty as his wife. Nicholas Colasanto, Theresa Saldana, and Frank Vincent all play supporting roles in the movie.\nScorsese was initially reluctant to develop the project, though he eventually came to relate to LaMotta's story. Schrader re-wrote Martin's first screenplay, and Scorsese and De Niro together made uncredited contributions thereafter. Pesci was an unknown actor prior to the film, as was Moriarty, who was suggested for her role by Pesci. During the filming, each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style and De Niro gained approximately 60 pounds (27\u00a0kg) to portray LaMotta in his later post-boxing years. Scorsese was exacting in the process of editing and mixing the movie, expecting it to be his last major feature.\n\"Raging Bull\" premiered in New York on November 14, 1980, and was released in theaters on December 19, 1980. The movie had a lukewarm box office of $23.4 million against its $18 million budget. The movie received mixed reviews upon its release; while De Niro's performance and the editing were widely acclaimed, it garnered criticism due to its violent content. Despite the mixed reviews, the movie was nominated for eight Academy Awards at the 53rd Academy Awards (tying with \"The Elephant Man\" as the most nominated movie of the ceremony), including Best Picture and Best Director, and won two: Best Actor for De Niro (his second Oscar) and Best Editing.\nAfter its release, \"Raging Bull\" went on to garner a high critical reputation, and is now often considered Scorsese's magnum opus and one of the greatest movies ever made. In 1990, it became the first movie to be selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in its first year of eligibility."}

There was great diversity in languages, religion, and cultural heritage.\nBringing together of the Lithuanian lands began in the late 12th century. Mindaugas, the first ruler of the Grand Duchy, was crowned as Catholic King of Lithuania in 1253. The pagan state was targeted in the religious crusade by the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order. When Gediminas began to rule, he allowed people to have different religions. This grew under his son Algirdas. In 1386 Jogaila changed the religion to Catholicism. He also made a dynastic union between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland.\nVytautas the Great grew the land of the Grand Duchy. He also led the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. After Vytautas's death, Lithuania's relationship with the Kingdom of Poland was not good. The Union of Lublin of 1569 created a new state, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. In this federation, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had a separate government, laws, army, and treasury.

The Soviet Union wanted Poland and Romania to let Soviet troops go through their territory, but Poland and Romania refused. The Soviet Union made a secret deal with Nazi Germany on 23 August. They planned to divide Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet lands.\nOne week later, German forces invaded Poland from the north, south, and west. Polish forces then withdrew to the southeast to wait for French and British support. The Soviet Red Army invaded the eastern Polish region of Kresy on 17 September. The Soviet government used the excuse that it was acting to protect the Ukrainians and Belarusians, who lived in the eastern part of Poland.\nThe Soviet government took pver the area.

It was from 5500\u20134500 BC.\nIt is abbreviated as LBK and is also known as the Linear Band Ware, Linear Ware, Linear Ceramics or Incised Ware culture.\nThe most evidence for the culture is in Central Europe. It is important evidence for early farming in Europe. The pottery after which it was named has simple cups, bowls, vases and jugs, without handles. They were made as kitchen dishes, or for carrying food and drink. The pots had line patterns on them.\nFarming.\nThe LBK people lived over a period of 1000 years, long before the Bronze Age and farmed crops like wheat, lentils and peas. They also kept cows and dogs, and sometimes hunted in the forests around them for other animals, like deer.\nFood and health.\nTheir diet probably didn't contain enough energy for them, as they often did not grow as tall as the people who came before them, or as people do now. This might have also been because of disease, which can spread more easily in a village than it can when people are moving about a lot and not seeing many other people, as people did before the Neolithic. People in the LBK culture probably died quite young, in their twenties or thirties, and many of their children would die before they grew up. \nIf a person was very sick and in a lot of pain, the LBK people might have had access to opium which did not make them better but took away the pain. They probably knew how to make some illnesses better by using wild herbs as medicine.\nReligion.\nThe LBK people probably worshiped a mother goddess, who represented the fertility of the land they farmed.\nTools.\nBecause this was before the Bronze or Iron Ages, there were no metal tools, and everything the LBK people had was made from either stone, wood and plants (such as flax which could be made into clothing, and things that could be got from animals (like leather or fur). They even had sickles, which are used for cutting down grass and are half-moon shaped blades with a handle coming off one end; however theirs were made of wood with sharp stone points glued into them for the cutting.\nHousing.\nThe LBK people lives in rectangular longhouses, and digging up an area often shows several clusters of about 6 of these long houses. The people in nearby clusters of houses probably knew each other and shared or traded their goods. Their houses were made of wood, mud and straw and they might have let their animals stay in there too.\nWar.\nSome LBK settlements have palisades, or long walls around them, to defend themselves from other people who might attack them. There are also some skeletons of LBK people that look like they died from battle injuries, and some look like they may have even been eaten by cannibals. This shows that there was a lot of war between nearby groups.\nImportant sites include Nitra in Slovakia; Bylany in the Czech Republic; Langweiler and Zwenkau in Germany; Brunn am Gebirge in Austria; Elsloo, Sittard, K\u00f6ln-Lindenthal, Aldenhoven, Flomborn and Rixheim on the Rhine; Lautereck and Hienheim on the upper Danube; R\u00f6ssen and Sonderhausen on the middle Elbe.\nThe Excavations at Oslonki in Poland had a large fortified settlement. There were nearly 30 longhouses and over 80 graves. This makes it one of the richest settlements in archaeological finds from all of central Europe."}

A recent DNA analysis (Oct. 2018) of three Cimmerians indicate \"the appearance of East Asian haplogroups in the steppe populations might be associated with the Iron Age nomads, starting with the Cimmerians.\" The authors found it \"noteworthy that the oldest of the Cimmerians studied here (cim357) carried almost equal proportions of Asian and West Eurasian components, resembling the Pazyryks, Aldy-Bel, and Iron Age individuals from Russia and Kazakhstan. The second oldest Cimmerian (cim358) was also the only one with both uniparental markers pointing toward East Asia. The Q1* Y chromosome sublineage of Q-M242 is widespread among Asians and Native Americans and is thought to have originated in the Altai Mountains. It has previously been identified in numerous ancient samples from Siberia, the Americas, and in representatives of the Siberian Bronze Age and nomadic populations.

He served two terms as premier, the first from 30 November 1855 to 25 August 1856, and a second term from 29 April 1857 to 10 March 1858.\nBorn in London, Haines attended Charterhouse school, and then Cambridge University where he studied surgery. He moved to Victoria in 1842, and started farming around Geelong. After selling the farms in the 1850's he became a magistrate and was appointed to Victoria's Legislative Council. He helped to write the Victorian Constitution. In December 1854 he became the Colonial Secretary, and assisted the Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham. \nThe British government passed the Victorian Constitution Act in 1855. Hotham was convinced to hand his power over as soon as possible. Haines and three other council members were made government ministers with the job of organizing the change to self-government. Haines was appointed by Hotham to be the Chief Secretary of Victoria and act as Premier until the elections could be orgaized. He resigned when several of the ministers wanted the elections by secret ballot. He thought this would increase corruption and bribery. He was reappointed when the Council decided that it, not the ministers should make the decision. He was the Chief Secretary until the first election in November 1856. After the election, as a member of the new Legislative Assembly, Haines became Premier until his government was defeated in 1857 by a group led by Sir John O'Shanassy. The O'Shanassy government was soon defeated and Haines again became Premier. In 1858 he was defeated during arguments about how the electorates should be divided. \nHaines traveled to the USA and Europe. On his return to Victoria in October 1860, he was again elected to the parliament, and became Treasurer in O'Shanassey's government. After losing his seat in 1863, he was appointed to the Legislative Council. "}

It is a medium-sized member of the crow family with glossy black and white plumage and a yellow beak. The yellow-billed magpie lives only in California where it can be found in dry and warm oak savannah and shady valleys along the Central Valley. It is an omnivorous species: Insects and seeds are its main food, but it also takes carrion, small vertebrates and eggs. The breeding season of the yellow-billed magpie starts in April and it takes until the end of June for all chicks to fledge. The birds breed in loose colonies of 3\u221230 nests and they feed in flocks of several dozens.\nJohn James Audubon was the first person to formally describe the yellow-billed magpie. He named it \"Corvus nuttalli\" to honor the naturalist Thomas Nuttall. Within the genus \"Pica\", the species is closest to the North American black-billed magpie (\"P. hudsonia\"). Both species share a common ancestor that migrated from Kamtchatka to Alaska some time in the Pleistocene. Black-billed and yellow-billed magpie diverged as a result of the glaciation of the Rocky Mountains. The yellow-billed yagpie became isolated in the warm climate of California and adapted to it. The species' population was hit hard by the outbreak of the West Nile Virus after 1999. It is currently not considered as endangered, but the virus and the degradation of its habitat pose a serious threat to some populations."}

His work ranged from realistic portraits to comic strip-like series of pictures called \"modern moral subjects\". His work is so well known that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as \"Hogarthian\".\nMoral series art.\nHarlot's Progress.\nIn 1731, he completed a series of moral works which made him recognised as a great and original genius. This was \"A Harlot's Progress\". It was first done as paintings, which are now lost. Then the series was published as engravings. In the six scenes, the fate of a country girl who became a prostitute in town is traced out. At the start, the girl meets a bawd, a woman who persuades her to take up prostitution. At her shameful end, the girl dies of venereal disease and there follows a merciless funeral ceremony. The engraving show vivid scenes of drunken and loose behaviour. The series was an immediate success.\nRake's Progress.\n\"A Rake's Progress\" showed in eight pictures the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant. Tom wastes all his money on luxurious living, whoring, and gambling, and dies in Bedlam. The original paintings of \"A Rake's Progress\" is displayed in the gallery room at Sir John Soane's Museum, London.\nMarriage \u00e0-la-mode.\nIn 1743\u20131745 Hogarth painted the six pictures of \"Marriage \u00e0-la-mode\" (National Gallery, London), a pointed skewering of upper class 18th century society. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best planned story serials. Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th century Britain. Marriages of convenience, and their unhappiness, came in for particular criticism.\nThe series shows the story of the fashionable marriage of the son of bankrupt Earl Squanderfield to the daughter of a rich but miserly city merchant. It starts with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover, and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at Tyburn.\nIndustry and Idleness.\nIn the twelve prints of \"Industry and Idleness\" (1747) Hogarth showed the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, the other idle. The industrious apprentice becomes Sheriff and Lord Mayor of London. The idle turns one to crime. In the end, he is executed at Tyburn. The idle apprentice is sent to the gallows by the industrious apprentice himself.\nThis shows the work ethic of Protestant England, where those who work hard get rewarded, and those who do not end badly, \nBeer Street and Gin Lane.\n\"Beer Street\" and \"Gin Lane\" (1751) was his warning on alcoholism. They were two engravings designed to be seen side by side. Hogarth engraved \"Beer Street\" to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage of English beer. On the other side was \"Gin Lane\". This showed the effects of drinking gin which, as a harder liquor, caused more problems for society. People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in \"Beer Street\", while in \"Gin Lane\" they are scrawny, lazy and careless. \nThe woman at the front of \"Gin Lane\" who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money. The prints were published in support of what would become the Gin Act of 1751.\nHogarth's friend, the magistrate Henry Fielding, may have got Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act: \"Beer Street\" and \"Gin Lane\" were issued shortly after Fielding's work \"An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings\".\nThe Four Stages of Cruelty.\nOther prints were his outcry against inhumanity in \"The Four Stages of Cruelty\" (published 21 February 1751). Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals, and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled \"Reward of Cruelty\", the murderer is shown being dissected by surgeons after his execution. The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 Act of Parliament. This allowed the public dissection of criminals who had been executed for murder.\nHogarth wished to stop \"that barbarous (mean) treatment of animals, the very sight of which renders [makes] the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling mind\".\nHumours of an Election.\n\"The Humours of an Election\" is a series of four oil paintings and later engravings by Hogarth. They show what went on in the 1754 election of a Member of Parliament. The oil paintings were created in 1755. \nAt this time each constituency elected two MPs, and there was a property qualification for voters, so only a minority of the male population was enfranchised. There was no secret ballot, so bribery and threats were used to raise votes.\nThe originals are held by Sir John Soane's Museum, London.\nHogarth was also a popular portrait painter. In 1746 he painted actor David Garrick as Richard III. He was paid \u00a3200, \u201cwhich was more,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthan any English artist ever received for a single portrait\u201d. In the same year a sketch of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success. \nHogarth's portrait of his friend, the philanthropic Captain Coram (1740; Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now Foundling Museum), and his unfinished oil sketch of \"The Shrimp Girl\" (National Gallery, London) are highly regarded. There are also portraits of his wife and his two sisters and of many others."}

He was a Belarusian poet and writer. Kupala is said to be one of the greatest Belarusian-language writers of the 20th century.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nKupala was born on July 7, 1882 in Viazynka. His family was of Szlachta origins. Both of his parents were tenant farmers. Kupala received a traditional Belarusian education. He finished his studies in 1898. After the death of his father in 1902, Kupala worked several short-term jobs. These included being a tutor, a shop assistant, and a record keeper.\nKupala's first serious try at writing was \"Ziarno\". It was a Polish-language sentimental poem which he completed around 1903\u20131904. His first Belarusian-language work (\"\u041c\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043b\u044f\") was dated July 15, 1904. Kupala's first published poem, \"\u041c\u0443\u0436\u044b\u043a\" (\"Peasant\"), was published about a year later. It was in the newspaper on May 11, 1905. Several more poems by Kupala were in the Belarusian-language newspaper \"Nasha Niva\" from 1906 to 1907.\nIn Vilnius and St. Petersburg.\nKupala moved from Belarus to Vilnius in 1908. He continued with his career as a poet. The first published collection of his poems, \"\u0416\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430\" (\"The Little Flute\") made the czarist government mad. The order for Kupala's arrest was ended in 1909.\nKupala left for St. Petersburg in 1909. In 1910 he published several works. He left St. Petersburg and returned to Vilnius in 1913. Among those influencing Kupala in the 1910s was Maxim Gorky.\nDuring the Soviet period.\nKupala's writing changed to an optimistic tone after the Great October Revolution of 1917. \nKupala was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1941 for the poetry collection \"\u0410\u0434 \u0441\u044d\u0440\u0446\u0430\" (\"From the Heart\").\nIn 1941 he moved to Moscow and then to Tatarstan. But even from there he wrote poems supporting Belarus fighting against Nazi Germany. He died mysteriously in 1942 in Moscow. He fell down the stairwell in Hotel Moskva. The death was said to be accidental. Some people think it was suicide or murder."}

This is thousands of times bigger than most volcanic eruptions which happened a long time. Supervolcanoes can occur when magma in the Earth rises into the crust from a hotspot, but can not break through the crust. More and more pressure builds up in a large and growing magma pool until the crust can no longer take the pressure. \nAlthough there are not many Quaternary supervolcanoes, supervolcanic eruptions usually cover very big areas with lava and volcanic ash. They can also cause a long-lasting change to weather (such as the triggering of a small ice age), enough to possibly make species extinct.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"supervolcano\" was first used in the BBC popular science television program \"Horizon\" in 2000 to mean eruptions of this type. \nVolcanologists (who study with volcanoes) and geologists do not say \"supervolcanoes\" in their scientific work. This is because the word can mean many different geothermal conditions. Since 2003, however, the term has been used by professionals when showing things to the public. The term \"megacaldera\" is sometimes used for calderas which are quite similar to supervolcanoes, such as the Blake River Megacaldera Complex in the Abitibi greenstone belt of Ontario and Quebec, Canada.\nSuper Eruptions.\nVEI 8 eruptions are considered super-eruptions due to their large scale.

Building was completed by 1604. They added several galleries half a century later. The ch\u00e2teau's corners had four octagonal towers.\nIn 1706, during the Great Northern War, Charles XII's army sacked the castle. The destroyed its fortifications. Several decades later, the Radziwills asked some German and Italian architects to fix and enlarge the chateau. Antoni Zaleski decorated its yellow facades with baroque stucco work. The 16th-century castle gates were also reconstructed. It was at this time that the three separate buildings surrounding the central courtyard were joined into a single structure.\nThe most important building in Nesvizh is the Corpus Christi Church. It is connected with the castle by a dam over a ditch. It has coffins of 72 members of the Radziwill family, each in a simple coffin made of birch and marked with Tr\u0105by Coat of Arms. Designed by the Italian architect Gian Maria Bernardoni, the church is said to be the first Jesuit temple patterned after Il Ges\u00f9 in Rome. It is the first domed basilica with Baroque facade in the world and the first baroque piece of architecture in Eastern Europe.\nIn 1770 the castle was taken by Russian forces. The Radziwill family was removed. The Lithuanian Archive was moved to Saint Petersburg (where it remains). The works of art in the palace were given to various Russian nobles. The Russian army left. The palace slowly fell into disrepair. It was restored by the Radziwills. Between 1881 and 1886 the castle's insides were fixed by Prince Anton Radizwill and his French wife, Marie de Castellane. They also made a landscape park in English style. With an area of more than one square kilometre, the park is one of the biggest in Europe.\nIn 1939, the Radziwill family was removed from the castle by the invading Red Army. In Soviet times, the chateau was used a sanatorium.\nIn 1994, the castle complex was made a national historical and cultural reserve.
