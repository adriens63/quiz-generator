{"id": "167867", "revid": "935234", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167867", "title": "Spiral", "text": "A spiral is a special curve in mathematics. This curve starts at a point, and then goes around the point, but gets farther and farther away from it. This is different from a circle (which is always at the same distance or an ellipse. A spiral is an \"open\" curve, unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves.\nTwo-dimensional spirals.\nA two-dimensional spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates. There the radius \"r\" is a continuous monotonic function of angle \u03b8 (\"theta\"). The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case. With the circle, the function would not be strictly monotonic, but constant.\nSome of the more important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:\nThree-dimensional spirals.\nFor simple 3-d spirals, a third variable, \"h\" (height), is also a continuous, monotonic function of \u03b8. For example, a conic helix may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface, with the distance to the apex an exponential function of \u03b8.\nThe helix and vortex can be viewed as a kind of three-dimensional spiral.\nFor a helix with thickness, see spring (math).\nIn nature.\nThe study of spirals in nature have a long history, Christopher Wren found out that many shells form a logarithmic spiral. Jan Swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from \"Helix\" to \"Spirula\" and Henry Nottidge Moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells. D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Thompson's \"On Growth and Form\" gives extensive treatment to these spirals. He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis, the shape of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a geometric progression. In some shell such as \"Nautilus\" and ammonites the generating curve revolves in a plane pirpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planer discoid shape. In others it follows a skew path forming a helico-spiral pattern.\nThompson also studied spirals occurring in horns, teeth, claws and plants.\nSpirals in plants and animals are frequently described as whorls.\nA model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H Vogel. This has the form\nwhere formula_2 is the index number of the floret and formula_3 is a constant scaling factor, and is a form of Fermat's spiral. The angle 137.5\u00b0 is related to the golden ratio and gives a close packing of florets.\nThe spiral also represents infinity. Starting at a single point, and revolving outwardly until the end of the universe. Because of this, some civilizations believe that the Spiral is a pathway to the afterlife.\nAs a symbol.\nThe spiral plays an important role in symbolism. It appears in megalithic art, notably in the Newgrange tomb or in many Galician petroglyphs such as the one in Mogor. See also triple spiral.\nScholars are still talking about the subject, but many of them now believe that the simple spiral in Chinese art may be a symbol of the sun. Roof tiles from the Tang Dynasty with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of Chang'an (modern-day Xian).\nThe spiral is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent. Because it appears at burial sites across the globe, the spiral most likely represented the \"life-death-rebirth\" cycle. Similarly, the spiral symbolized the sun, as ancient people thought the sun was born each morning, died each night, and was reborn the next morning. \nSpirals are also a symbol of hypnosis. This most likely comes from the clich\u00e9 of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral (One example being Kaa in Disney's \"The Jungle Book\"). They are also used as a symbol of dizziness, where the eyes of a cartoon character, especially in anime and manga, will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed. The spiral symbolizes the double helix structure of DNA, representing biological evolution, and the spiral structure of a galaxy."}

Its administrative center is the city of Uzhhorod. Other major cities within the oblast include Mukachevo, Khust, Berehove and Chop which is home to railroad transport infrastructure.\nZakarpattia Oblast was formally established on January 22, 1946 after the annexation of Subcarpathian Rus lands to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the Ukrainian independence referendum held in 1991, Zakarpattia Oblast voters were given a separate option on whether or not they favored autonomy for the region. Although a large majority favored autonomy, it was not granted.\nZakarpattia Oblast is in the Carpathian Mountains landscape of western Ukraine, and is the only Ukrainian administrative division which borders upon four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. The Carpathian Mountains play a major part in the oblast's economy, making the region an important tourist and travel destination housing many ski and spa resorts.\nThe oblast is ranked 23rd by area and 17th by population. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of Zakarpattia Oblast is 1,254,614. Excluding Ukrainians, this total includes people of many different nationalities of which Hungarians, Romanians and Rusyns constitute significant minorities in some of the province's cities, while in others, they form the majority of the population (as in the case of Berehove).\nGeography.\nZakarpattia Oblast has a total area of 12,800\u00a0km\u00b2 and is in the Carpathian Mountains region of western Ukraine. It is the only Ukrainian oblast to have boundaries with four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. On the West it borders the Pre\u0161ov and Ko\u0161ice Regions of Slovakia and Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n and Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg Counties of Hungary, on the South\u2014the Satu Mare and Maramure\u015f Counties of Romania, on the East and Northeast\u2014Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and on the North\u2014Lviv Oblast and the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland.\nZakarpattia Oblast mostly consists of mountains and small hills covered with deciduous and coniferous forests, as well as alpine meadows. Mountains cover about 80% of the oblast's area, and cross from North-East to South-East. The Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians, part of which are within Zakarpattia Oblast, were recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.\nThe largest rivers that flow through the oblast include the Tysa, Borzhava, and the Tereblia. The region's climate is moderate and continental with about 700-1000 millimetres of rainfall per year. The average temperature in summer is +21\u00b0\u0421 (70\u00b0F) and -4\u00b0\u0421 (25\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter. With a total height of , Hoverla, part of the Chornohora mountain range, is the tallest point in the oblast. The lowest point, 101 metres above sea level, is in the village of Ruski Heyevtsi in the Uzhhorodskyi Raion.\nThe four of the oblast's historical-cultural sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine competition in 2007: Palanok Castle, Museum upon the Chorna River, Mykhailiv Orthodox Church, and the Nevytsky Castle.\nHistory.\nZakarpattia was part of Kingdom of Hungary, later Austria-Hungary until the latter's demise at the end of World War I. This region was briefly part of the short-lived West Ukrainian National Republic in 1918 and occupied by Romania at end of that year. It was later recaptured by Hungary in the summer of 1919. Finally, it joined the newly formed Czechoslovakia as \"Subcarpathian Rus\", of which it formed one of the four main regions, the others being Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia.\nDuring the World War II German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the southern part of the region was awarded to Hungary under the First Vienna Award in 1938. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived Second Czecho-Slovak Republic. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on March 15, 1939 and the Slovak declaration of an independent state, Ruthenia declared its independence (Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.\nDuring the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, almost the entire Jewish population was deported; few survived the Holocaust. When the Soviet Army crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President Edvard Bene\u0161 formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the Soviet Union. It was then incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as \"Zakarpattia Oblast\".\nThe province has a unique footnote in history as the only region in the former Soviet Union to have had an American governor: its first governor was Gregory Zatkovich, an American citizen who had earlier emigrated from the region and represented the Rusyn community in the U.S. Zatkovich was appointed governor by Czechoslovakia's first president, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk, in 1920 and served for about one year until he resigned over differences regarding the region's autonomy.\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held an independence referendum in which the residents of Zakarpattia were asked about the Zakarpattia Oblast Council's proposal for self rule. About 78% of the oblast's population voted in favor of autonomy, however, it was not granted. There were also propositions of separating from Ukraine to rejoin Czechoslovakia, but after Czechoslovakia's dissolution into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993, these ideas have been rendered largely moot.\nOn October 25, 2008, delegates to the Congress Of Carpathian Ruthenians declared the formation of the Republic of Carpathian Ruthenia. The prosecutor\u2019s office of Zakarpattia region has filed a case against Russian Orthodox Church priest Dmytro Sidor and Yevhen Zhupan, an Our Ukraine deputy of the Zakarpattia regional council and chairman of the People\u2019s Council of Ruthenians, on charges of encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine.\nPolitics.\nZakarpattia Oblast's local administration is controlled by the Zakarpattia Oblast Council (\"rada\"). The Chairman of the Council is Mykhailo Kichkovskyi, elected from the People's Union \"Our Ukraine\" party. Kichkovsky holds this position since his election in April 2006.\nThe Zakarpattia Oblast Rada consists of a total of 90 deputies. Based on the March 26, 2006 regional election results, the distribution of the council's mandates is as follows: 30 mandates for the People's Union \"Our Ukraine;\" 25 for the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc; 7 for the Lytvyn People's Bloc; 5 for the Party of Hungarians of Ukraine \"KMKS;\" 4 for the Democratic Party of Hungarians of Ukraine; and 4 for the Socialist Party of Ukraine.\nThe oblast's governor (currently Oleh Havashi) is appointed by the President of Ukraine.\nAdministrative divisions.\nZakarpattia Oblast is administratively subdivided into 13 raions (districts), as well as 5 cities (municipalities) which are directly subordinate to the oblast government: Berehove, Chop, Khust, Mukachevo, and the administrative center of the oblast, Uzhhorod. There are a total of 7 cities, 19 towns, and more than 579 villages.\nZakarpattia Oblast can also be divided into four unofficial geographic-historic regions (counties): Ung, Bereg, Ugocsa, and Northern Maramuresh.\nThe following data incorporates the number of each type of administrative divisions of Zakarpattia Oblast:\nRaions.\nThere are 13 raions (districts) in the oblast:\nCities.\nLargest cities and towns in the province are (with population figures in 2007):\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of Zakarpattia Oblast is 1,254,614. The current estimated population is 1.2 million people (as of 2004).\nAlthough ethnic Ukrainians are in majority here (80.5%), other ethnic groups are relatively numerous in Zakarpattia. The largest of these are Hungarians (12.1%), Romanians (2.6%), Russians (2.5%), Roma (1.1%), Slovaks (0.5%) and Germans (0.3%). The Ukrainian government does not recognize the Rusyn people living in that country as a distinct nationality but rather as an ethnic group of Ukrainians. About 10,100 people (0.8%) identify themselves as Rusyns according to the last census.\nTheir languages and culture are respected by the provision of education, clubs, etc. in their respective languages. Those who recognize Ukrainian as their native language total 81.0% of the population, Hungarian \u2014 12.7%, Russian \u2014 2.9%, Romanian \u2014 2.6%, and Rusyn \u2014 0.5% Residents in seven of Mukachivskyi Raion's villages have the option to learn the Hungarian language in a school or home school environment.\nZakarpattia is home to approximately 14,000 ethnic Roma (otherwise known as Gypsies), the largest population of Roma in Ukraine. The first Hungarian College in Ukraine is in Berehovo, the II. R\u00e1koczi Ferenc College.\nEconomy.\nZakarpattia Oblast's economy depends mostly on trans-border trade, vinery and forestry. The oblast is also home to a special economic zone.\nThe oblast's main industry includes woodworking. Other industries include food, light industry, and mechanical engineering. Segment of foodstuffs in the structure of ware production of national consumption is 45%. The total number of large industrial organisations is 319, compared to 733 small industrial organisations.\nThe most common crops grown within the region include cereals, potatoes and other vegetables. In 1999, the total amount of grain produced was 175,800 tons, of sunflower seeds \u2014 1,300 tons, and potatoes \u2014 378,200 tons. The region also produced 76,100 tons of meat, 363,400 tons of milk and 241,900,000 eggs. The total amount of registered farms in the region was 1,400 in 1999."}

It was the third annual event under the Night of Champions name and the ninth annual event under the Vengeance/Night of Champions chronology. Similar to the previous two events, the concept of the show was that every championship in the company would be defended. It featured talent from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. Eight matches were contested on the card.\nBackground.\nNight of Champions will have professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers from the \"Raw\", \"Friday Night SmackDown\", and \"ECW on Sci Fi\" brands. Wrestlers will play a villain or a hero. All wrestlers will be from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands\u2014a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to a television program of the same name.\nThe main rivalry from SmackDown for Night of Champions is between CM Punk and Jeff Hardy in their battle over the World Heavyweight Championship. One month before the show, at Extreme Rules, Punk used his guaranteed title match he earned by winning the Money in the Bank ladder match against Hardy; he beat him, and won the World Heavyweight title. The two had many confrontations about it which lead to The Bash and a match that saw Punk get disqualified for kicking the referee. Then, Hardy attacked Punk because Hardy thought Punk kicked the referee on purpose. On the July 2 episode of \"Superstars\" fans were told that Punk had suffered a storyline eye injury. Punk's reasoning to Hardy's accusation was that he kicked the referee on accident due to his inability to clearly see Jeff, who he was really trying to kick. To settle the dispute on to who the rightful champion was, SmackDown general manager, Theodore Long, announced another match between the two at Night of Champions, which was accepted by both competitors.\nRaw will be represented by Randy Orton defending the WWE Championship. After beating Triple H at The Bash, Orton did not have a contender for the championship, so on the June 29 episode of \"Raw\", special guest host of the week, as well as onscreen matchmaker, Batista, said that the title would be defended at Night of Champions against the winner of a single-elimination tournament. The first two matches of the four-person tournament were that night with Triple H beating Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and John Cena beating The Miz (Mike Mizanin). Triple H and Cena wrestled each other the next week on \"Raw\", but Orton's allies, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, interfered in the match, attacking both Cena and Triple H. Because of that, it was announced Orton would defend the title against both Triple H and Cena in a triple threat match."}

In its later forms, it is also called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910) or, since the 1940s, a record player. \nCreation.\nThomas Edison made his first phonograph with the mouth piece of the early telephone and some tinfoil. He thought he could talk into the mouth piece to make a disk vibrate, as the disk vibrated a needle would put grooves in the tinfoil. When Edison adjusted the machine to play and cranked the lever, he was surprised to hear his voice play back to him. He said his ideas rarely worked the first time. These cylinders could record sound, but due to their cylindrical shape, they could not be copied cheaply with a mold.\nThe phonograph was soon replaced by the graphophone by Alexander Graham Bell in his Volta Laboratory. Later it was replaced with the disc phonograph, cassette tapes, compact discs, audio files and other devices. These later inventions made stereo sound. \nGramophone.\nThe gramophone, invented by Emile Berliner, plays sounds from a flat disk record. The record is placed onto the turntable. The turntable spins the record while a lever with a small needle on the bottom lies between the little grooves in the disk. When the grooves make the needle vibrate, music is played. These machines do not record, but the disks could be copied quickly onto vinyl disks in a factory with a mold, called a master."}

Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.\nEducation.\nRenewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children, spend out of school collecting fuel. In addition, the displacement of traditional fuels reduces the health problems from indoor air pollution produced by burning those fuels.\nHealth.\nRenewable energy can also contribute to better health by providing energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment. It can also provide power for supplying the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce infectious disease.\nKenya.\nKenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya\nannually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans adopt solar power every year than make connections to the country\u2019s electric grid."}

The war took place from October 6 to 24, 1973. It began on the Jewish day of repentance, Yom Kippur, and happened during the Muslim month of Ramadan. The attack by Egypt and Syria surprised Israel, which had conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights from Egypt in 1967, during the Six Day War. The Egyptian Army entered the eninsula to retrieve the land from Israel.\nThe Sinai and the Golan Heights had belonged to Egypt and Syria but were occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War. One of Syria's aims for the war was the return of the Golan Heights.\nDuring the first few days of the war, Egypt and Syria scored astounding victories. Israel was shocked by the attack and was on the verge of defeat. The first Israeli counterattacks failed against both Egypt and Syria. However, Israeli attacks later repelled the Syrian forces and pushed them back further into Syria. The Iraqi army joined the war with Syria and the Israeli army stopped advancing.\nOn the Egyptian front, the Israeli attacks against Syria had served as a distraction against the Egyptian offense. That allowed the Egyptian Army to dig deeper into the Sinai Peninsula, around 12\u00a0km, which was 2\u00a0km more than the original plan. Israel feared a massive military defeat and so called on the United Statesfor aid. The Americans inittially refused, but since Israel threatened to use its nuclear weapons, that was enough to persuade US President Richard Nixon to help Israel. America conducted Operation Nickel Grass, which gave Israel 20 tons of military equipment and ammunition. That aid was vital to Israel by allowing it to continue fighting, according to US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, However, that claim was later denied.\nCourse of war.\nThe Egyptian army crossed the Suez Canal on October 6 and destroyed the Israeli defenses and forts on the other side of the canal. Israel tried for the next few days to defeat the Egyptians but could not push them back behind the canal. The United States started sending ammunition and weapons to Israel by using airplanes to help the Israeli Army win the war during Operation Nickel Grass. Syria soon pleaded Egypt to help it by attacking Israel. On October 14, Egypt attacked again and tried to advance even more into the Sinai. Israeli attacked again and, after heavy fighting, crossed the canal at its center between two Egyptian armies. Israeladvanced north and south and kept moving south until it had reached the city of Suez. Israel trapped a large Egyptian force on the eastern side of the canal in the Sinai Peninsula. The Israelis tried but failed to capture Suez, and they also failed to advance north. They reached an area 101 km from Cairo, the capital of Egypt.\nOn October 15, the Battle of the Chinese Farm took place and is regarded as one of the deadliest and longest tank battles since World War II. After the battle had ended, Moshe Dayan stated, \"I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see.\" Ariel Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: \"It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. Soldiers who never surrendered. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there.\"\nSevere losses were suffered by Israel during the battle. Israeli units suffered heavy casualties in men and equipment; Amnon Reshef's armored losses during the first night of the battle alone were comparable to those of Egypt during its disastrous October 14 offensive. For their part, the Egyptian armored forces in the 16th Division's bridgehead had been severely reduced. As of 18 October, the 21st Armored Division had no more than 40 tanks remaining of the 136 tanks that had been available at the start of the battle, not counting 21 tanks that were received as reinforcements. The 16th Infantry Division had only 20 tanks remaining in its organic tank battalion. The attrition warfare served the Egyptians' war strategy of inflicting maximum casualties on the Israelis. However, from another perspective, the initiative had passed to the Israelis during the battle. For Egypt, the battle was a indecisive military victory and moral victory for Egypt. For Israel it was a military victory on the Syrian front but a defeat and humiliation in Egyptian Front.\nThe United Nations passed a resolution in the Security Council that asked all the countries to bring a ceasefire, a temporary stop to the war. The Arab countries and Israel agreed, but the ceasefire ended by the Israeli Army advancing south to reach Suez. Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev, said to United States President Lyndon Johnson that if the Americans did not send troops, Soviet troops would be sent to the area. The United States thought that was a threat and put its military on full nuclear alert. The increased tension between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War made Israel agree to a ceasefire and end the war. That was the closest the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, had been to nuclear war since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\nAftermath.\nThe war ended on October 26, 1973. Egypt and Israel later negotiated and reached an agreement to separate their forces. That led to Israel retreating behind the Suez Canal and to Egypt staying in the Sinai Peninsula, near the canal, and not retreating from the places that it had captured. Egypt and Israel also agreed to have their forces far apart in the Sinai Peninsula.\nIsrael also held negotiations with Syria and agreed to withdraw from captured areas in Syria, but the negotiations failed and so Israel stayed in the Golan Heights. Egypt and Israel kept their negotiations and in 1979 signed the Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty. The gradual retreat of Israeli forces took place, and all of the Sinai Peninsula returned to Egyptian hands in 1982. The treaty still holds real military victory was ever won; it was a military \"stalemate\".\nThe peace treaty was so shocking to the Arab world that Egypt was forced to leave from the Arab League and to fight the Egyptian-Libyan War in 1977. The Libyan attack eventually failed, and Egypt planned to march into the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and to remove the Libyan dictator, Muammar al-Gadhafi. The plan was later scrapped by intervention from the Arab League, which resulted in a ceasefire after four days of fighting, Egypt had repelled all Libyan advances and won the war.\nAfter the and the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty an Islamist group planned the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981 for recognizing Israel. The assassination squad was led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli after a fatw\u0101 approving the assassination had been obtained from . Islambouli was tried, found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad in April 1982.\nOn 6 October 1981, Sadat was assassinated during the annual victory parade held in Cairo to celebrate Egypt's crossing of the Suez Canal. Islambouli had emptied his assault rifle into Sadat's body in the front of the grandstand and mortally wounding Sadat. In addition to Sadat, eleven others were killed, including the Cuban ambassador; an Omani general; a Coptic Orthodox bishop and Samir Helmy, the head of Egypt's Central Auditing Agency (CAA). Twenty-eight were wounded, including Vice-President Hosni Mubarak, Irish Defence Minister James Tully, and four US military liaison officers.\nYom Kippur war was won by Israel. Syrians do not like to talk about the war since much of it was seen as a Syrian defeat.\nResponse in Israel.\nThough the war reinforced Israel's military deterrence, it had a stunning effect on the population in Israel. After its victory in the Six-Day War, the Israeli military had become complacent. The shock and sudden reversals during the beginning of the war caused a terrible psychological blow to the Israelis, who had experienced no serious military challenges.\nA protest against the Israeli government started four months after the war ended and was led by Motti Ashkenazi, the commander of Budapest, the northernmost of the Bar-Lev forts and the fort not to be captured by Egypti during the war. There was much anger with the Israeli government, particularly Dayan. Shimon Agranat, President of the Israeli Supreme Court, was asked to lead an inquiry, the Agranat Commission, into the events leading up to the war.\nThose who knew the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Moshe Dayan, stated that the war had deeply depressed him. He went into political eclipse for a time and resigned on October 21, 1979.\nDuring the fourth day of the war, Dayan changed his attitude on Egypt frombefore the war. He had jokingly recommended the Israeli government to accept Egyptian fire since he thought that Egypt would never go to go to war after the Six-Day War because it was too weak. He also thought of accepting Egyptian demands to retreat from Sinai. That day, he said in a statement, \"This is a very difficult war, with strong and very bitter confrontations of the armored corps and air force. This war is heavy in days and heavy in blood.\" In another statement, a former Israeli MP, Uri Avneri, said, \"Something happened to Dayan during the war, On the third or fourth day of the war, Dayan walked amongst the army commanders and among politicians in Tel Aviv saying this was the destruction of the Third Temple. Meaning that this was the end of Israel\"\nThe war in Israel left allegedly 10-15% of the population in shock and constant anxiety by the destruction of the myth of \"Israeli invincibility\" and by the huge losses suffered during the war. That ended the careers of Moshe Dayan and Golda Meir, who had been the president of Israel from 1969 to 1974.\nResponse in Egypt.\nFor Egypt, the successes during the war healed the psychological trauma of its defeat in during the Six-Day War and allowed it to negotiate with the Israel as equals. The first 11 days of the Yom Kippur War let Egypt, although it suffered major defeats in some battles, to destroy the myth of Israeli invincibility, and they greatly boosted the Egyptian Army's image after the humiliation of 1967.\nThe Yom Kippur War was in Egypt seen as a great war that took the shame of 1967 by allowing all Egyptian objectives to happen. Egypt had successfully crossed the Suez Canal and held a portion of Sinai, which later helped it to negotiate the return of all of the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt had also defeated Israel at the last major battle of the war, the , and repelled the Israeli invasion of the city, with police forces and civilians defending the city with light weapons against Israeli tanks with one armored brigade and one infantry battalion.\nThe commanders of the Second and Third Armies, Generals Khalil and Wasel, were also dismissed from the army. The commander of the Egyptian Second Army at the start of the war, General Mamoun, suffered a heart attack or a nervous breakdown after the Egyptian defeat during the October 14 Sinai tank battle, and he was replaced by General Khalil."}

It was written by Ray Bradbury and first published in 1953.\nThe novel is about a future American society in which people are hedonistic (meaning they live only for pleasure), and reading is against the law because it makes them think. The main character, Guy Montag, has a job as a \"fireman\" (which, in this future, means \"book burner\"). The number \"451\" refers to the temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which the books burn when the \"firemen\" burn them \"for the good of humanity\". Written in the early years of the Cold War, the novel is a critique of what Bradbury saw as an increasingly dysfunctional American society.\nThe idea began with Bradbury's short story \"Bright Phoenix,\" written in 1947 but first published in the \"Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" in 1963. The original short story was reworked into the novella, \"The Fireman\", and published in the February 1951 issue of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\". The novel was also serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of \"Playboy\" magazine. Bradbury wrote the entire novel on a pay typewriter in the basement of UCLA's Powell library. His original idea in writing \"Fahrenheit 451\" was to show his great love for books and libraries. He has often referred to Montag as an allusion to himself.\nOver the years, the novel has been subject to various interpretations, primarily focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas. Bradbury has said that the novel is not about censorship; he says that \"Fahrenheit 451\" is a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature, which leads to people thinking that knowledge is made up of \"factoids\", partial information without context, such as Napoleon's birth date alone, without an indication of who he was.\nA movie version of the novel was released in 1966, and at least two BBC Radio 4 dramatizations have also been aired, both of which follow the book very closely."}

To understand how a stack works, think of a deck of playing cards that is face down. We can only easily access the card that is on top. When we want to look at the top card, there are two things we can do: we can peek at it, but leave it on the stack, or we can pop it off. When we pop off the top object, we are taking it off the stack. If we want to add another card to the top of the stack, we push. \nA stack is called a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection. This means that the last thing we added (pushed) is the first thing that gets pulled (popped) off. If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace, then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace.\nHistory.\nThe stack was first proposed in 1955, and then patented in 1957, by the German Friedrich L. Bauer. The same concept was developed independently, at around the same time, by the Australian Charles Leonard Hamblin.\nOther operations.\nIn modern computer languages, the stack is usually implemented with more operations than just \"push\" and \"pop\". Some implementations have a function which returns the current length of the stack. Another typical helper operation is \"top\" (also known as \"peek\"), which can return the current top element of the stack without removing it. Another common operation is \"dup,\" which makes a copy of the element at the top of the stack."}

Scientists looked at what happens when the protons hit antiprotons to see if they are right about their ideas as to what protons are made of.\nThe Tevatron was a circular particle accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), just east of Batavia, Illinois. It was the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 6.28 km (3.90 miles) ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million ($ today) and has been regularly upgraded since then. (The 'Energy Doubler', as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam \u2014 512 GeV \u2014 on July 3, 1983.)

They need to do this before the LHC is fixed, because the LHC is much better at finding things.\nThe scientists at the Tevatron had a year's headstart on the scientists at the LHC. Whoever finds the Higgs will be honored by other scientists. That is why the scientists at the Tevatron wanted to find it before the scientists at the LHC.\nThe Tevatron discovered three of the 17 fundamental particles including the top quark.

{"id": "168129", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168129", "title": "MOSFET", "text": "A MOSFET is an electronic component that acts as an electrically controlled switch.\nMOSFET stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. Transistors are small electrical devices that are used in, amongst other things, alarm clocks, calculators, and, perhaps most famously, computers; they are some of the most basic building blocks of modern electronics. A few MOSFETs amplify or process analog signals. Most are used in digital electronics.\nMOSFETs act like valves for electricity. They have one input connection (the \"gate\") which is used to control the flow of electricity between two other connections (the \"source\" and \"drain\"). Said another way, the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs. Think of a dimmable light switch: the knob itself selects 'ON', 'OFF', or somewhere in between, controlling the brightness of the light. Think of a MOSFET in place of the light switch: the switch itself is the \"gate\", the \"source\" is the power coming into the house, and the \"drain\" is the light bulb.\nThe name MOSFET describes the structure and the function of the transistor. MOS refers to the fact that a MOSFET is built by layering metal (the \"gate\") on oxide (an insulator which prevents the flow of electricity) on semiconductor (the \"source\" and \"drain\"). FET describes the action of the gate on the semiconductor. An electric signal is sent to the gate, which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the \"source\" and \"drain\".\nAlmost all MOSFETs are used in integrated circuits. As of 2008, it is possible to fit 2,000,000,000 transistors on a single integrated circuit. In 1970, that number was around 2,000.\nOperation.\nThere are four common types of MOSFET:\nEnhancement mode N-Channel MOSFET.\nThe switch between the \"source\" and \"drain\" is usually off. You can turn the switch on by applying a positive voltage to the \"gate\", so it is higher voltage than the \"source\".\nEnhancement mode P-Channel MOSFET.\nThe switch between the \"source\" and \"drain\" is usually off. You can turn the switch on by applying a negative voltage to the \"gate\", so it is lower voltage than the \"source\".\nDepletion mode N-Channel MOSFET.\nThe switch between the \"source\" and \"drain\" is usually on. You can turn the switch off by applying a negative voltage to the \"gate\", so it is lower voltage than the \"source\".\nDepletion mode P-Channel MOSFET.\nThe switch between the \"source\" and \"drain\" is usually on. You can turn the switch off by applying a positive voltage to the \"gate\", so it is higher voltage than the \"source\".\nDepletion mode P-Channel MOSFETs are not usually available.\nDifferences between MOSFETs.\nIntegrated circuits.\nA small piece of silicon can have millions of MOSFETs created on it. This makes an integrated circuit. See the integrated circuit article for details.\nThe rest of this section is about single MOSFETs with three connections.\nHeat.\nIf the MOSFET is partly on, it will reduce the power going through it. It does that by converting some power into heat. Even if it is on, it will still convert some power to heat.\nThe MOSFET has a resistance. When current flows from the MOSFET's drain to its source, there will be a voltage drop. Multiply that current and voltage to get the power loss. That lost power becomes heat.\nThe MOSFET must get rid of that heat, usually by passing it into the air.\nSmaller MOSFETs warm up and heat the nearby air. Some MOSFETs must be on a circuit board, which has a larger area to heat more air. The highest-power MOSFETs must be on a heatsink. The heatsink is a large piece of metal with fins to transfer the heat to the air over a large area. They may also need a fan to push lots of air over the heatsink.\nOther differences between MOSFETs.\nThere are lots of different MOSFETs available. When choosing a MOSFET, once you have decided among the 4 main types, there are lots of other things to think about. Differences between MOSFETs include:\nTheory.\nThere are many different ways to make MOSFETs on the semiconductor. The simplest method is shown in the diagram to the right of this text. The blue part represents P-type silicon, while the red part represents N-type silicon. The intersection of the two types makes a diode. In silicon semiconductor, there is a quirk called the \"Depletion Region\". In doped silicon, with one part being doped N-Type, and one part being doped P-Type, a depletion region will naturally form on the intersection between the two. This is because of their acceptors and donors. P-type silicon has acceptors, also known as holes, which attract electrons towards them. The N-Type silicon has donors, or electrons, which are attracted to holes. In the border between the two, the electrons from the N-Type fill the holes in the P-type. This results in the acceptor, or P-type atoms becoming negatively charged, and since negative charges attract positive charges, acceptors, or holes, will flow towards the \"junction\". On the N-Type side, there is a positive charge, which results in the donors, or electrons, flowing towards the \"junction.\" When they get there, they will be repelled by the negative charge on the other side of the junction, since alike charges repel. The same will happen on the P-Type side, the donors, or holes will be repelled by the positive area in the N type side. No electricity can flow between the two, since no electrons can move to the other side.\nMOSFETs use this to their advantage. The \"Body\" of the MOSFET is powered negatively, which widens the depletion region, since the holes are filled with the new electrons, so the opposite force to the electrons on the N side becomes much larger. The \"Source\" of the MOSFET is powered negatively, which shrinks the depletion zone in the N type entirely, since there are enough electrons to fulfill the positive depletion zone. The \"Drain\" has a positive power. When the \"Gate\" is supplied with positive power, it will make a small electromagnetic field, which will remove the depletion zone directly below the gate, since there will be a \"spray\" of holes, which will make something called an \"N-Channel\". The N-Channel is a temporary region of the P-Type silicon area where there is no depletion zone. The positive electric field will neutralize all of the spare electrons that make up the depletion zone. The electrons in the source area will then have a clear way to move to the \"Drain\", which would make electricity flow from source to drain."}

Its name comes from the words \u2018port at the head of the river\u2019. The town was built on the mouth of a small river; the main road in the town once met the water at the top of the river.\nLots of buildings in the town are of a Victorian style.\nPortishead's dock and railway lines.\nPortishead dock.\nIn the 1860s, in the middle of the iron and steel era, a pier and a dock were built for the big boats that could not easily get to Bristol Harbour. The ships brought in expensive items from around the world and took items made in the town to other countries. Many ships carried coal.\nIn the 1880s Portishead Dock was bought by Bristol Corporation, and was managed as part of the Port of Bristol until it closed.\nPortishead power stations.\nThe Portishead power stations were coal power stations built near the dock. The first power station was built in 1926. It began making electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation. The power station was made bigger in 1948.\nA 2nd power station was started in 1949 and began making electricity in 1955.\nAfter 1949, the power stations became part of the country's electricity industry. They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield which was moved by train along the Portishead Railway. The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company; it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879.\nThe 1st power station closed in 1976, and the 2nd closed in 1982. The dock was closed in 1992.\nRailway stations.\nPortishead had two train stations for people who lived in the town. The main station was near the centre of Portishead, and the other was at the Pier. The construction of the 2nd power station caused the 1st train station to be removed and another station was opened in the main street of the town on 2 January 1954. The new station closed on 7 September 1964. People who live in Portishead now want the train station to be opened again."}

In general, the rule states that a gift of a will (or a trust) will not be enforced if the subject of the gift is to be given to a person who can not be known now, and will not be able to be known, by the end of 21 years after the death of everyone who was alive (including children in their mother's uterus but not yet born) at the time the gift was created. \nFor example, if a woman says in her will that her house is to be given \"to the children of her children when they graduate from college\" this would not be enforced by a court. It would not be enforced because one (or more) of her children's children might not graduate from college until 21 years after everyone who was alive at the time of the woman's death has died. \nThe purpose of the rule is to prevent property from being tied up for \"perpetuity\" (a very long time). The courts (and many people in society) do not want to hold property to see who will receive it after a complicated set of rules from the gift-giver. First, this would result in a waste of the courts' time and resources. Second, it would be a waste of the property that is being given through the gift. If a gift in a will violates the Rule against Perpetuities, the court will simply strike that gift and transfer the subject of the gift as if the will had not mentioned it.\nHowever, many countries and states have changed this rule, and it does not apply at all, or in a changed way, in those countries and states."}

She was built as a tender to the liners RMS \"Olympic\" and RMS \"Titanic\", and is the last remaining boat built for the White Star Line still afloat.\nHistory.\nThe keel of \"Nomadic\" was laid down in the Harland and Wolff shipyards, Belfast in 1910 (yard number 422). She was launched on 25 April 1911 and delivered to the White Star Line on the 27 May. The ship was 67\u00a0meters (220\u00a0ft) long and 11.3\u00a0meters (37\u00a0ft) wide, with a gross tonnage of 1,273\u00a0tons. She had two three-bladed screws, propelling her to a maximum speed of 12\u00a0knots.\nWith her sister ship SS \"Traffic\", \"Nomadic\" was used as a tender for \"Titanic\" and \"Olympic\" at Cherbourg in France. This meant she would ferry the passengers from Cherbourg to \"Titanic\" \"Olympic\" as they were too big to fit into the port at Cherbourg.\n\"Nomadic\" was fitted with a luxurious interior and was used for the first and second class passengers, whilst \"Traffic\" served the third class travellers.\nDuring World War I \"Nomadic\" saw service in carrying American troops at Brest (France).\nIn 1927, she was sold to Compagnie Cherbourghoise de Transbordement and then sold again to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cherbourghoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934. Then under the name \"Ingenieur Minard\", she again served as troop ship in World War II.\nAfter the war she continued tendering Cunard White Star (White Star Lines and \"Cunard\" merged in 1934) ships until November 1968. She then served RMS \"Queen Elizabeth\" for the last time.\nIn 1974, \"Nomadic\" was bought by a private individual and converted into a restaurant on the Seine in Paris, where she remained docked and semi-abandoned after the closure of the restaurant, until she was moved to the port of Le Havre in 2003.\nPreservation of \"Nomadic\".\nA public appeal for donations to return \"Nomadic\" to the Harland and Wolff shipyard for restoration was organised by Belfast Industrial Heritage (BIH), a non-profit organisation in Northern Ireland in collaboration with enthusiasts through the SaveNomadic.com Appeal.\nOn 26 January 2006, SS \"Nomadic\" was purchased at auction in Paris by the Department for Social Development, part of the Northern Ireland Office. She cost \u00a3171,320 (the reserve price being \u00a3165,000).\nSS \"Nomadic\" left Le Havre to return to Belfast on 12 July, and arrived back close to where she was built on 18 July 2006. The vessel was welcomed back by the Social Development Minister David Hanson MP and the Deputy Lord Mayor of the City of Belfast, Councillor Ruth Patterson and a number of well wishers. The \"Nomadic\" arrived \"piggy backed\" on a marine transportation barge, which had been contracted from Anchor Marine Transportation Limited.\nA study by Belfast City Council has estimated the cost of restoring \"Nomadic\" at \u00a37\u00a0million. Belfast Harbour Commissioners have agreed to provide a temporary berth for the ship, and a charitable trust to co-ordinate fundraising for the restoration has been set up.\nNow that the vessel is on the United Kingdom's National Register of Historic Vessels, the project should qualify for a National Lottery grant application, which should greatly enhance existing funds of \u00a360,000 from a public appeal and \u00a3100,000 from Belfast City Council.\nThe Nomadic Appeal Public Website has now founded the Nomadic Preservation Society.\nLocation.\nOn her return to Belfast, SS \"Nomadic\" was moored at Queen's Quay just outside the Odyssey Arena in Belfast and opened with a temporary exhibition. In late 2008 the ship was closed to the public and moved to Barnett's Dock for internal maintenance. It is expected she will soon enter Hamilton Graving Dock for drydocking and complete restoration.\nIn January 2009, the company Frazer-Nash has been appointed to manage the Conservation Management Plan. The level of restoration will then be decided.\nIt is planned that the restoration of SS \"Nomadic\" will be completed in time for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of \"Titanic\" in 2012."}

It is the distance that light travels in 3.26 years, or just under 31 trillion kilometres (about 19 trillion miles). This is from the definition: a parsec is the distance from the Sun to an object which has a parallax angle of one arcsecond.\nDistances measured in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within the same star system. \nSurveying provides an everyday example of parallax. Go outside and look at a distant object. Hold your hand out with one finger raised and close one eye. Line up your finger so it covers the object from view. Then close that eye and open the other without moving your arm. Now, move your finger to block that eye's line of sight. The two positions your finger was at can be used to find the distance from the object. This is what a survey crew does to figure out land plot boundaries. The mathematical technique used in the calculation is trigonometry. A parsec is so large that if you could see that far that you would be looking in to the past. You are looking 3.26 years in the past because it takes 3.26 years for the light to come from a parsec away."}

It is about a human space colony at the star Tau Ceti.\nPlot Summary.\nHundreds of years in the future, people travel to the star Tau Ceti. It takes 100 years to fly there. To live that long the people go to sleep and freeze each other. When they get there they unfreeze, but some people do not wake up. Some people wake up but are not as smart as they were.\nThey land on the fourth planet from the sun and build a town on a big island. Everything is peaceful until they are attacked by a large animal. The animal is like a cross between a frog and an alligator. It is big but also \"very\" fast and smart. They call it a Grendel. The Grendel kills several people but then it is killed.\nThe people get very scared and build fences, land mines, and guns. After a while they get less scared and think that the Grendel they killed was the only one. They build boats and get brave. Then another bigger Grendel kills some of the people in the boats. The People trap and kill this Grendel.\nThe People get really mad. They find out that Grendels have to stay near water because when a Grendel moves fast it makes a lot of heat. If it does not cool off it will die. They go all around the island and kill all the Grendels. This makes them very happy.\nThey feel safe and travel all around the island. They notice that the alien fish are big now. They think that without the Grendels around there will be lots of fish to eat. This makes them happy.\nEverything is good until the fish get very big. When they get big enough they grow legs, breath air, and move very fast. The fish are \"baby Grendels\". Now instead of a few big Grendels there are thousands of small ones.\nSome people escape to the space ship. But, other stay to defend the town. They use the electric fences and land mines and guns to kill the little Grendels. After awhile the town gets too damaged to protect anymore. The people run away to a cave on a mountain. The Grendels follow them up a river and attack the cave. The people use kerosene to burn the Grendels. Also, they knock big rocks down onto them. After enough Grendels get killed, the other Grendels learn to run away instead of just attack. The people \"win\".\nOver time the people hunt down all the new Grendels and all the alien fish. Finally they are safe."}

It is the largest college of the federal University of London. As well as undergraduate teaching, it is one of the largest research universities in the country.\nUCL was founded in 1826 as 'University College'. It was the first university institution to be founded in London and the first in England to be established on an entirely secular (non-religious) basis. It admits students regardless of their religious beliefs. UCL was also the first admit women on equal terms with men. University College became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London in 1836.\nUCL has over 100 departments, institutes and research centres in eight faculties. Its main campus is in the Bloomsbury area of central London. There are also a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London.\nIt has grown through mergers. These include the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014).\nHistory.\nThe original University College was based largely on ideas of Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832), a lawyer, social philosopher and free-thinker. Bentham believed in libertarianism, utilitarianism, women's suffrage, and the separation of church and state. These are beliefs of liberalism. The college was unique in that it was secular, and was called \"that Godless institution in Gower Street\".\nUniversity College was founded on 11 February 1826, under the name \"London University\", as a secular alternative to the strictly Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It was founded from the beginning as a university, not a college or institute.\nHowever, its founders got such strong opposition from the Church of England that it prevented them from getting the Royal Charter needed for the award of degrees. King's College London was specifically founded to provide an Anglican rival to UCL. It was not until 1836, when the latter-day University of London was established, that University College was legally recognised and granted the power to award degrees of the University of London.\nResearch.\nUCL has over 7,000 academic and research staff and 840 professors, the highest number of any British university. There are currently 56 Fellows of the Royal Society, 51 Fellows of the British Academy, 15 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 121 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences amongst UCL academic and research staff.\nUCL is a major centre for biomedical research; it is part of three of the 12 biomedical research centres established by the NHS in England and is a founding member of UCL Partners, the largest academic health science centre in Europe.\nFor the period 1999 to 2009 it was the 13th most-cited university in the world (and the most-cited in Europe). There has been at least one Nobel Prize winner from UCL every decade since the establishment of the Nobel Prizes in 1901. There are 29 Nobel Prize winners and three Fields Medalists amongst UCL\u2019s alumni and current and former staff, the most recent being Sir Charles Kao, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.\nAccording to a ranking of universities produced by SCImago Research Group, UCL is ranked 12th in the world (and 1st in Europe) in terms of total research output. According to data released in July 2008 by ISI Web of Knowledge, UCL is the 13th most-cited university in the world (and most-cited in Europe). The analysis covered citations from 1 January 1998 to 30 April 2008, during which 46,166 UCL research papers attracted 803,566 citations. The report covered citations in 21 subject areas and the results revealed some of UCL's key strengths, including: Clinical Medicine (1st outside North America); Immunology (2nd in Europe); Neuroscience &amp; Behaviour (1st outside North America and 2nd in the world); Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology (1st outside North America and 4th in the world); Psychiatry &amp; Psychology (2nd outside North America); and Social Sciences, General (1st outside North America).\nUCL is a member of the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the Russell Group, and other national and international groups. It forms part of the 'Golden Triangle' of British universities."}

{"id": "168333", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168333", "title": "Migraine", "text": "A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms.\nMost migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have \"auras\" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72\u00a0hours.\nMigraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called \"episodic migraine\" (EM). If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called \"chronic migraine\" (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get \"chronic migraines\" later. Chronic migraine then may \"revert\" or go back to episodic migraine.\nScientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for \"calcitonin gene-related peptide\". CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges, a covering above the brain.\nThere are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone estrogen in their body either drops too low or \"fluctuates\" (goes up and down).\nThe World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States.\nTypes.\nChildhood periodic syndromes.\n\"Childhood periodic syndromes\" are a group of migraine syndromes that children may have. When a child has one of these child periodic syndromes there is a greater chance that they will get one of the other, more common types of migraines when they become adults.\nAbdominal migraine is a kind of migraine which causes a very bad pain in the area of the abdomen, usually around the 'belly-button' which is called the \"periumbilical area\". Abdominal migraine usually affects children starting at about age 7, but it may affect younger children and older children, and it may also sometimes affect adults.\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short): (this means harmless dizziness, that happens again and again and happens suddenly) is a medical condition which occurs in children usually starting between two and five years of age; it often disappears by the age of eight. BPVC causes vertigo.\nCyclic vomiting syndrome or cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS), is a medical condition whose main symptoms are nausea and repeated vomiting. CVS happens more often in children, but it can occur at any age.\nChronic vs. episodic migraine.\nEpisodic migraine (EM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 14 days or less in one month, while chronic migraine (CM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 15 or more days in one month. When compared to persons with episodic migraine, those with CM where less likely to have full-time jobs and had a larger risk of headache-related disability. Persons with CM are almost twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, and/or depression; they also have a 40% greater chance of having heart disease and angina and are 70% more likely to have a history of stroke.\nAbout 7.68% of total migraine cases are chronic migraines and about 1% of people in the United States have CM, with a higher rate among females, middle-aged people, and in those households that had the lowest annual income. (The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study)\nAura.\nAura (from the Greek word for breeze) is the word used to describe a series of neurological symptoms that may begin before an epileptic seizure or a migraine headache. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems such as \"scotomas\" (losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots etc.), vertigo, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking.\nScotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: \"skotos\"): a \"blind spot\" or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is. Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either \"absolute\" where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, \"relative\" with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma.\nScotomas may also have different patterns and shapes like the \"fortification\" scotoma; it is called fortification because it looks like the outline of an old fort. Scotomas can start of small and then get bigger, move around to different parts of a person's visual field, and they can also look like flickering lights.\nRisk factors and triggers.\nIn medicine a \"factor\" is a substance, a condition or an activity, or a lack thereof that increases the chance of a certain outcome or condition happening. If it increases the chance of something unhealthy it is a \"risk factor\". A \"trigger factor\" or 'trigger' for short is a factor that may cause an activity or the signs and/or symptoms of a medical condition to begin.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are no specific tests to diagnose migraine but a doctor may use different tests to rule out other causes for a person's symptoms. The diagnosis of migraine is a \"clinical diagnosis\" which means it is based upon a person's \"medical history\" that a person reports to the doctor. The medical history for a possible migraine diagnosis which can be called the \"headache history\" includes information such as:\nDifferential diagnoses.\n\"Differential diagnoses\" are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. Before a doctor makes a \"final diagnosis\", which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them.\nDisorders that often occur with migraine.\nOften, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders. These other disorders are the \"comorbid disorders\" or \"comorbidities\". There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines. The treatment and \"prognosis\" (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders.&lt;br&gt;\nComorbid psychiatric conditions\nComplications of migraine.\nIn medicine, a complication is a problem that happens because of, a procedure (like surgery), treatment (like medication), or illness (like migraines).\nEpidemiology.\nIn medicine \"epidemiology\" is the study of what causes diseases and medical conditions, how often they happen, where they happen and who they happen to.\nMigraine is more common among boys than girls until the beginning of puberty when girls start getting migraines more often than boys. By the later part of the teenage years girls get migraines almost twice as much as boys do. The number of people who get migraines is highest between the ages of 25 to 55 years in both men and women, after which, the risk of getting migraines get lower as a person gets older.\nBetween 65-75% of adult migraine sufferers are women and of these women, about two-thirds have menstrual migraines. Migraines are more common in people who make less money, there may be different reasons why such as stress.\nAbout two-thirds of migraines are migraines without aura and the remaining one-third of cases are migraine with aura.\nHistory.\nSymptoms that mimic those of migraines have been recorded in various cultures throughout written history. The first known mention was found on cuneiform tablets from Babylonia dating to 2000-1880 B.C.E. A treatment for migraine can be found in the \"Ebers Papyrus\", an Ancient Egyptian medical text named after George Ebers, the German Eygptologist who discovered them. In the ancient text dated to 1552 B.C.E. migraine is refereed to as \"suffering in half the head\".\nThe Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia's description of a type of headache he dubbed \"heterocrania\" is considered a description of migraine."}

In 1715 Prussia and Hannover joined the war against Sweden. The King of Hannover was also King George II of Great Britain.\nAfter the coalition attacked them, Sweden invaded Russia in 1709 which was not a good idea. The Russian Army retreated so the Swedish Army had to chase them. When winter came it was the coldest winter that Europe had had in a hundred years and half of the Swedish soldiers died in the cold. Eventually the Swedish army caught up to the Russian army and they had a battle, called the battle of Poltava. Russia won the battle but most of the Swedish soldiers, including king Charles XII of Sweden, escaped and went to the Ottoman Empire. Peter, the king of Russia, didn't like this so he declared war on the Ottoman Empire. He lost and had to give the town of Azov back to the Ottomans.\nCharles XII left the Ottoman Empire in 1714 and went to Stralsund in Pomerania which was owned by Sweden at the time but was under siege. Charles escaped back to Sweden just before the people in Stralsund surrendered. Then he invaded Norway (which was owned by Denmark at the time.) and was shot and killed there. With their king gone, the Swedish soldiers left Norway and went back to Sweden. On the way back many soldiers died.\nWhen all that was happening Russia had been invading Sweden. Russia conquered Estonia, Livonia and Ingria. By the time the remaining soldiers had come back from Norway, Russia had completely conquered Finland. Sweden still didn't want peace though, because they would have to give lots of land to Russia. Russia used a newly made fleet of ships to attack and raid the Swedish Coast and Sweden would still not give up. Eventually the Russian and Swedish ships came together in the Battle of Grengam. Both sides thought they had won the battle so no treaty was signed until the Russians continued using their boats to damage the Swedish coast. Finally Sweden gave up in 1721. Sweden had made peace with Denmark in 1720 and in 1721 Sweden signed the treaty of Nystad.\nTreaties.\nIn the Treaty of Nystad Sweden had to give land to other countries. Sweden had to give Estonia, Livonia and Ingria to Russia but could keep Finland. Sweden also signed other treaties. These were the treaty of Stockholm where Sweden gave Prussia Swedish Pomerania and the treaty of Fredericksborg where Sweden had to pay Denmark-Norway money for the damage the war had done.\nThis war was significant because it allowed Russia to become the dominant power in Northeastern Europe, instead of Sweden."}

Materials with high resistivity are called \"thermal insulators\" and are used in clothing, thermoses, home insulation, and cars to keep people warm or in refrigerators, freezers, and thermoses to keep things cold. \nThermal conductivity is often represented by the Greek letter \"kappa\", formula_1. The units of thermal conductivity are watts per meter-kelvin. Watts are a measure of power, meters are a measure of length, and kelvins are a measure of temperature. From the units, we can see that thermal conductivity is a measure of how much power moves through a distance due to a temperature difference.\nSome great thermal insulators are:\nVacuum, Aerogel, Polyurethane\nSome great thermal conductors are:\nSilver, Copper, Diamond\nSilver is one of the most thermally conductive materials (and is relatively common), and because of this there are some cool experiments you can do with silver that show extremely well how thermal conduction works.\nOne example is when you put 2 spoons in boiling water, one spoon is steel and the other is silver. When you take the spoons out of the boiling water, the silver spoon is hotter than the steel spoon. The reason for this is that silver conducts heat better than steel. The silver spoon will also cool off faster because of this, as it is better at releasing heat.\nAnother example of silver's thermal conductivity is to put different materials on ice cubes. An iron washer will just sit on the ice and slowly become colder. A copper penny will melt through the ice cube and become colder faster. A silver coin, spoon, or ring on the ice cube will sink into it almost as though the ice cube were made of thick syrup, and the silver will become ice cold almost instantly. Again, this is because the silver is really good at drawing heat from the air and giving it to the ice cube. Copper is also good at this, but not as much as silver."}

Many people staying in hospices have cancer or AIDS. People who stay in hospices are expected to die soon, but sometimes they get better. Hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them. Hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible. A member of the hospice team visits regularly, and someone is usually always available by phone \u2014 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Hospice may be covered by Medicare.\nMost hospice care is provided at home \u2014 with a family member typically serving as the primary caregiver. However, hospice care is also available at hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and dedicated hospice facilities.\nHospices have doctors, nurses, and other people who go to patients houses, nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine.\nHistory.\nThe Hospice movement was started in England in the 1950s by a nurse named Dame Cicely Saunders. The word Dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospices that the Queen of England made her a female knight.\nA different nurse named Florence Wald brought hospice medicine to the United States because she worked with Dame Cicely Saunders and liked what she did. \nTypes of Hospice Care.\nThere are four types of hospice care, and all of them focus on different stages of a patient\u2019s needs.\nIn-Home Hospice : The first level of hospice care is in-home hospice, which means that hospice staff will come to a patient\u2019s home to provide care. This type of hospice care is typically used in the early stages of hospice, helping patients transition from a hospital to their homes. \nContinuous Care : The second level of hospice care is continuous care, which is in-home care with 24/7 support. With constant care, a patient has a member of hospice staff on hand at all times to help assist in symptom management.\nIn-Patient Hospice : The third level of hospice care is in-patient hospice care. While it\u2019s never a patient\u2019s first choice to be in a hospital, away from the comfort of their home, there are times when symptoms become too much to manage even by continuous in-home care. In-patient hospice allows a patient to be observed by nurses and physicians around the clock, ready at a moment\u2019s notice to treat advanced symptoms and offer expert insights and care. In-patient hospice facilities tend to be calmer and more \u201chome-like\u201d than regular hospital visits to replicate a familiar setting\u2019s comfort.\nRespite Care : The fourth and final level of hospice care is respite care. Respite care exists as a sort of hybrid between in-patient and in-home or continuous home care. The point of respite care is primarily to offer relief to caregivers. Especially for those with no medical background, becoming a primary caregiver to a hospice patient can be too physically taxing and emotionally draining. Respite care allows caregivers relief from the responsibility of having a hospice patient in their care for as many as five days and nights to recharge."}

Offa died in 796 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith, who reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.\nKing of Mercia.\nOffa was the son of Thingfrith, a descendant of Eowa of Mercia. Eowa was a king of Mercia who ruled along with his more famous brother Penda of Mercia. In 757 the king of Mercia,Athelbald, was murdered. There was a short civil war between others claiming the throne. An ealdorman named Beornred seized the throne of Mercia but Offa drove him out of Mercia and became king himself that same year. The alliances Athelbald had formed fell apart when Offa came to power. Offa had very little power outside of Mercia for the first several years of his reign.\nBretwalda (overlord).\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no mention of Offa for the years between 757\u2014777. No Mercian chronicles from this time period have survived. Charters are the only records that give any idea of Offa's power outside of Mercia. But he proved to be ruthless, bold and creative in bringing Kent, Sussex and Essex under his control. Aethelbert the king of Kent was apparently under Offa's influence before he died in 762. In 794 another Aethelbert, a king in East Anglia was beheaded at Offa's command. When Egbert of Wessex made a bid for the throne of Wessex in 786 Offa had him banished from England. He made Beorhtric king of Wessex instead. Egbert was welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years. In charters Offa issued in Kent, East Anglia, Sussex and Middlesex he simply used the style \"Rex Merciorum\" (Latin for king of Mercia). Only in three church charters does he expand his title to indicate he is overlord of all of England. \nOffa had diplomatic relations with Charlemagne. He was one of the few Anglo-Saxon monarchs to have dealings with continental rulers. Letters and presents were exchanged. But when Offa sought a marriage of his son to one of Charlemagne's daughters, relations were quickly cut off. Charlemagne had all Frankish ports closed to British ships. Offa, very involved in church affairs, presided over church councils personally in 786-7. In 787 he convinced the pope to create the position of archbishop of Lichfield in Mercia. He wanted his own archbishop who was closer at hand than the Archbishop of Canterbury. He reorganized the defenses of his kingdom. One of these defenses, Offa's Dyke was a massive earthworks between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms to the west. Offa died in 796. His son, Ecgfrith, lasted only 141 days as king. Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's reign."}

In the 1960s Peter Higgs was the first person to suggest that this particle might exist. On 14 March 2013, scientists at CERN confirmed for the time that they had found a Higgs particle.\nThe Higgs particle is one of the 17 particles in the Standard Model, the model of physics which describes all known basic particles. The Higgs particle is a boson. Bosons are thought to be particles which are responsible for all physical forces. Other known bosons are the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. Scientists do not yet know how to combine gravity with the Standard Model.\nThe Higgs field is a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory. Unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, the Higgs field takes the same non-zero value almost everywhere. The question of the Higgs field's existence was the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, was \"the central problem in particle physics\".\nIt is difficult to detect the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is very massive compared to other particles, so it does not last very long. There are usually no Higgs bosons around because it takes so much energy to make one. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was built mainly for this reason. It speeds up two bunches of particles to almost light speed (travelling in opposite directions), before setting them on a path to collide with each other.\nEach collision produces a flurry of new particles which are detected by detectors around the point where they collide. There is still only a very small chance, one in 10 billion, of a Higgs boson appearing and being detected. To find the few collisions with evidence of the Higgs boson, the LHC smashes together trillions of particles, and supercomputers sift through a massive amount of data.\nHiggs bosons obey the conservation of energy law, which states that no energy is created or destroyed, but instead can be transferred or change form. First, the energy starts out in the gauge boson that interacts with the Higgs field. This energy is in the form of kinetic energy as movement. After the gauge boson interacts with the Higgs field, it slows down. This slowing down reduces the amount of kinetic energy in the gauge boson. However, this energy is not destroyed. Instead, the energy from the motion goes into the field and is converted into mass-energy, which is the energy stored in mass. The mass created can become what we call a Higgs boson. The amount of mass created comes from Einstein's famous equation E=mc2, which states that mass is equal to a large amount of energy (for example, 1\u00a0kg of mass is equivalent to almost 90 quadrillion joules of energy\u2014the same amount of energy used by the entire world in roughly an hour and a quarter in 2008). Since the amount of mass-energy created by the Higgs field is equal to the amount of kinetic energy that the gauge boson lost by slowing down, energy is conserved.\nHiggs bosons are used in a variety of science fiction stories. The physicist Leon Lederman called it the \"God particle\" in 1993.\nDiscovery.\nOn 12 December 2011, the two teams at the Large Hadron Collider looking for the Higgs boson, ATLAS and CMS, announced that they had finally seen results which could suggest the Higgs boson existed; however, they did not know for certain if this was true.\nOn 4 July 2012, the teams at the Large Hadron Collider declared that they had discovered a particle which they think is the Higgs boson.\nOn 14 March 2013 the teams had done much more testing, and announced that they now think the new particle is a Higgs boson."}

It is a series that is used to create an estimate (guess) of what a function looks like. There is also a special kind of Taylor series called a Maclaurin series.\nThe theory behind the Taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane (x- and y-axes), then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point. This is done by taking the derivatives of the function and adding them all together. The idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum.\nIn mathematics, a Taylor series shows a function as the sum of an . The sum's terms are taken from the function's derivatives. Taylor series come from Taylor's theorem.\nHistory.\nThe Ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea first came up with the idea of this series. The paradox called \"Zeno's paradox\" is the result. He believed that it would be impossible to add an infinite number of values and get a single finite value as a result.\nAnother Greek philosopher, Aristotle, came up with an answer to the philosophical question. It was Archimedes, however, who came up with a mathematical solution using his method of exhaustion. He was able to prove that when something is split up into an infinite number of tiny pieces, they will still add up to a single whole when all of them are added back together. The ancient Chinese mathematician Liu Hui proved the same thing several hundred years later.\nThe earliest known examples of the Taylor series are the work of M\u0101dhava of Sa\u00f1gam\u0101grama in India in the 1300s. Later Indian mathematicians wrote about his work with the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. None of M\u0101dhava's writings or records still exists today. Other mathematicians based their work on M\u0101dhava's discoveries and worked more with these series until the 1500s.\nJames Gregory, a Scottish mathematician, worked in this area in the 1600s. Gregory studied the Taylor series and published several Maclaurin series. In 1715, Brook Taylor discovered a general method for applying the series to all functions. (All of the previous research showed how to apply the method to only specific functions.) published a special case of the Taylor series in the 1700s. This series, which is based around zero, is called the \"Maclaurin series\".\nDefinition.\nA Taylor series can be used to describe any function \"\u0192\"(\"x\") that is a smooth function (or, in mathematical terms, \"infinitely differentiable.\") The function \"\u0192\" can be either real or complex. The Taylor series is then used to describe what the function looks like in the neighborhood of some number \"a\".\nThis Taylor series, written as a power series, looks like:\nThis formula can also be written in sigma notation as:\nHere \"n\"! is the factorial of \"n\". \"\u0192\"\u00a0(\"n\")(\"a\") is the \"n\"th derivative of \"\u0192\" at the point \"a\". formula_3 is a number in the function's domain. If the Taylor Series of a function is equal to that function, the function is called an \"analytic function.\"\nMaclaurin series.\nWhen formula_4, the function is called a Maclaurin series. The Maclaurin series written as a power series looks like:\nWhen written in sigma notation, the Maclaurin series is:\nCommon Taylor series.\nSome important Taylor series and Maclaurin series are the following.\nWhere formula_15 is the nth Bernoulli number, and formula_16 is the natural logarithm."}

He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors in history. Many people say that he is the best ever. The famous Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini said he was the world's best conductor other than himself.\nFurtw\u00e4ngler was especially famous for conducting the music of famous German composers. His performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner are very well known and loved by many people.\nEarly life.\nFurtw\u00e4ngler was born on January, 25, 1886 in Berlin, Germany. He grew up in Munich, where his father was an archaeologist and professor. He started learning about music when he was very young. He learned to play the piano and was very talented. He also began writing music. He wrote several pieces before he was 20 years old. He kept writing music for the rest of his life, but his pieces never became very famous.\nConducting career.\nFurtw\u00e4ngler first started conducting as a young man. He wanted to conduct in order to perform his own music. However, he quickly became famous for conducting the music of others. The very first piece he conducted in public was the 9th Symphony of Bruckner. He conducted many orchestras before he finally became the leader of the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1922. Later, he also had many other important conducting jobs. The most important was the director of the Bayreuth Festival, a very famous German music festival.\nThe Nazis and World War II.\nWhen the Nazis took over Germany in the 1930s, Furtw\u00e4ngler was in an awkward position. He wanted to conduct some kinds of music that the Nazis did not like. He left some of his conducting jobs in protest when they did not let him perform. In 1936 he almost left Germany to live in the United States, where the New York Philharmonic Orchestra wanted him to conduct. However, the Nazis still thought he was a good conductor, and they kept him in Germany. He also wanted to stay to protect the German music from the Nazis. People in the United States did not like him for staying, even though he did not really like the Nazis.\nDuring World War II Furtw\u00e4ngler continued to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. He gave many very famous concerts during this time. But towards the end of the war, the Nazis became unhappy with him. He fled from Germany in 1945 and lived in Switzerland for several years. He did not conduct again for two years.\nAfter the war.\nAfter the war, Furtw\u00e4ngler was still in a difficult position. The Allies thought that he had been a Nazi supporter because he had stayed in Germany. They put him on trial, but finally decided he was innocent. He was allowed to go back to conducting in 1947. Even though he was innocent, people in the US still did not like him. He was going to conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, but he was not allowed to because people got angry about it.\nFurtw\u00e4ngler gave many successful concerts after the war. He still conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and other famous orchestras in Europe. Furtw\u00e4ngler gave the most famous concert of his career in 1951. That year, he conducted Beethoven's 9th Symphony at the Bayreuth Festival. It was the first time that the festival had happened since the end of the war, six years before. Many people say that this concert was the greatest musical concert in history. Furtw\u00e4ngler finally died in 1954, when he was 68 years old.\nMusical style.\nFurtw\u00e4ngler had a very unusual way of conducting. His movements with the baton were very awkward and jerky. Some people said he looked \"like a puppet on a string\" when he conducted. He liked to slow down and speed up the music very often. Furtw\u00e4ngler believed that there was more to music than just the notes on the score. He felt it was the performer's job to make each performance something special. This meant that he often played the same piece in very different ways at different concerts. Even when he changed the way he played a piece, though, the music was thought to be very beautiful. He did not like conductors who just played the notes on the page without doing anything special with the music.\nAs a younger conductor, Furtw\u00e4ngler played music by many different composers. However, as he got older, he usually only played music by the great German composers. Some of his favorites were Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner.\nRecordings.\nFurtw\u00e4ngler did not make many recordings in studios. Recording technology was still very new at the time and did not work well for recording long classical pieces at first. However, many of Furtw\u00e4ngler's concerts were recorded, especially during and after World War II. Today people think these are some of the best recordings of all time. His famous concert at Bayreuth in 1951 is one of these concert recordings."}

He is thought of as one of the most important diplomats of all time. Metternich was Foreign Minister for Austria from 1809 to 1848. He got Austria out of a bad treaty with Napoleon, which forced Austria to fight for France. Metternich then helped to build a system in Europe that kept the peace for most of the next 100 years.\nIn 1809, when Metternich became foreign minister, Napoleon had control of most of Europe. France had taken over some of the closest countries directly. In more distant countries like Austria and Prussia, Napoleon forced them to sign treaties that would make them fight on his side in wars. Metternich thought that was bad for Austria. When Napoleon declared war and raised a huge army for the French invasion of Russia, Metternich told the Russians that Austria would not attack but only defend. Napoleon lost badly in Russia, and Metternich used that excuse to get out of the treaty.\nIn 1814, troops of the Quadruple Alliance (Prussia, Russia, Austria and the United Kingdom) had entered France, and Napoleon had lost the war. For the next year, diplomats from all over Europe met at the Congress of Vienna to decide the future after Napoleon.\nMetternich believed that the best way to keep Europe peaceful was to create a balance of power, with no country being strong enough to beat all the other countries. To make sure that happened, he made some countries stronger so that other countries, especially France, would think twice about going to war. For example, he added Belgium and Luxembourg to the \nNetherlands, he turned 300 small countries of Germany into a group of larger countries, and he put together some countries in what we call Italy today.\nAfter making that new order, Metternich also did a lot to keep it together. For example, he Alexander I of Russia Alexander wanted to send troops to Greece to protect Orthodox Christians there fighting the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire, which was Muslim. The Ottomans had become weak, and Alexander would probably have won. Metternich was afraid that if the Ottoman Empire fell apart, all of the powerful countries in Europe would start fighting to get its land. That would upset Metternich's balance and start a huge war. Also, Russia might get too big and too powerful. Therefore, Metternich convinced the Alexander attacking now would make the Ottomans would fall apart before Alexander was ready to take it for himself, and the United Kingdom and France would get most of it. Alexander agreed to help keep the Ottoman Empire going so that Russia could later take all of it. Also, he was talked out of sending troops to Greece.\nMetternich kept peace in Europe for a long time, but there were still some revolts in Europe. Finally in 1848, many revolts happened at the same time. One of them was in Austria, and the rebels had Metternich taken out of office. After he was gone, Otto von Bismarck in Prussia managed to become powerful, take over the German Confederation and start a big German country, which still exists. Having one big Germany, however, upset Metternich's balance and helped to cause World War I."}

After the Holy Roman Empire fell, Germany had fallen into over 300 different small kingdoms. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna decided that these weak kingdoms were not strong enough to keep France from trying to take them over, which it had already done once under Napoleon. So the Congress combined all those little countries into 39 larger countries, which were still very small compared to the powerful countries of Europe. \nThe problem was that the Congress did not want to make them too strong, or they'd start taking over other countries. So they put the 39 countries into a confederation which meant that they were all separate countries, but they agreed to help defend each other, and in some ways acted like one big country. The Confederation would not be strong enough to attack another country; only strong enough to preserve the European balance of power. \nThe German Confederation lasted until 1866, when the members fought each other. The winners formed a new North German Confederation. In 1871 after winning the Franco-Prussian War, Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Prussia, combined all the countries of Germany into the German Empire."}

The signals go into the cell body (or soma).\nA cell may have hundreds of dendrites, but may have only one axon. The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma, and the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber.\nA dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse, which is a very narrow gap between the two cells. When electrical impulses reach the end of an axon, they trigger the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite, where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell.\nThe movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current, which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal.\nIf the dendrites get lots of signals from axons, then it sets off a chain reaction. The chain reaction is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse.\nFully differentiated neurons do not divide. However, stem cells in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism. Generally, once born, neurons do not divide.

It was released in 20007. It tells the story of one of the massacres committed by the newly formed Israeli army during Operation Hiram. The massacres were committed in Eilaboun, a village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee. In the Eilabun massacre, fourteen men were killed, and twelve of them were executed. The village people were expelled to Lebanon and became refugees for a few months. The villagers eventually managed to return secretly.\nSynopsis.\nThe movie starts with Melia Zreiq (an old woman from Eilaboun) saying\n\u201cI hope God will bring peace to this land, and let the peoples live together - a good life. I hope there will be peace.\u201d\nIlan pappe takes about Plan Dalet, a plan that David Ben-Gurion and the Haganah leaders in Palestine worked out during autumn 1947 to spring 1948, and explains the details of the plan, and how was it performed. In October 30th, 1948, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun at approximately 5 AM. They then forced the people of Eilaboun together in the main square of the village. They chose seventeen young men. Five of them were taken as human shield, and the rest of the twelve were killed, each in a different location. This all happened after the expulsion of the rest of the village to Lebanon, where they became refugees after a five days forced march to Lebanon. After a UN peace keeper observed and reported Israel was forced to allow the people back.\nThat same night, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun, a then Christian village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the sea of Galilee. Most of the villagers were hiding in the two village churches.\nThe soldiers ordered the people to gather in the village square, while going out of the Catholic Church the soldiers shot at the people killing an old man, making him the first victim. The soldiers chose seventeen men, and ordered the village to walk to Maghar, a village five kilometers to the north of Eilaboun. Shortly after the people left the village, the soldiers executed twelve of the young men, and five were taking to drive an army vehicle as human shields and later sent to a prisoners of war camp. The Israeli army had looted Eilaboun but left the houses.\nWhen the villagers reached Maghar, the soldiers ordered them to continue to Kafr 'Inan, where the near Kafr Inan another man was killed, making the number of victims fourten. Kafr 'Inan and Eilaboun were both expelled to Farradiyya, a nearby village. The Israeli soldiers gathered the people of Eilaboun, Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya (al-Farradiyya), looted the people and took all worthy. They spent the night in Farradiyya. In the morning the Israeli soldiers separated the women, children and the old from the men. The young men from the three villages were sent to prisoner of war camps. The women, children and the old of the three villages were marched to Mirun where they spent three nights without any food or water. At Mirun, the Israelis put everyone in two cattle trucks, and took them to Rmeish (in Lebanon). Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya were later razed to the ground by the Israeli army.\nAbout 52 villagers were left in the village, mainly old people and children. The priests complained about the expulsion of the villagers and demanded their return. Following a UN investigation and pressure activated by the Vatican, the villagers eventually managed to return clandestinely. After 6 months from the massacre most of the villagers managed to come back from Lebanon, and all the men were released from the prisoners of war camps.\nAwards and festivals.\nThe movie won the Al-Awda award in 2008, and was screened in many festivals and events as:"}

{"id": "168539", "revid": "1104213", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168539", "title": "Dengue fever", "text": "Dengue fever (pronounced \"DEN-gi\") is a tropical infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes. Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking.\nMost people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough water. However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment.\nThere is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. There is also no treatment to cure dengue fever. Doctors can only provide \"supportive care,\" which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms.\nSince the 1960s, many more people have been getting dengue fever. Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world. It is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever.\nSigns and symptoms.\nMost people who get the dengue virus (80%) have no symptoms, or have only mild symptoms (like a basic fever). About 5% of infected people (or 5 out of every 100) get much sicker. A small number of these people have symptoms that could kill them.\nAfter a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, it takes between 3 and 14 days for them to get sick. (This is called the virus's incubation period.) Most often, people start to feel sick after 4 to 7 days.\nOften, when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are the same as gastroenteritis (stomach flu), like vomiting and diarrhea, or the common cold. However, children are more likely to have bad complications from dengue fever.\nDengue fever happens in three stages: febrile, critical, and recovery.\nThe febrile stage.\nIn the \"febrile stage\", people with dengue usually have a high fever. (\"Febrile\" means that a person has a fever.) The fever is often over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Sometimes the fever gets better, and then comes back.\nDuring the febrile stage, people may also have:\nThe febrile stage usually lasts 2 to 7 days. This stage ends when a person's high fever is gone.\nThe critical stage.\nIn about 5% of people with dengue fever, the disease goes into a \"critical stage\" next. (\"Critical\" means \"very dangerous.\") The critical phase usually lasts 1 to 2 days.\nDuring this stage, plasma (the liquid part of blood) leaks out of the body's small blood vessels. The plasma can build up in the chest and abdomen. This is a serious problem for a few reasons.\nPlasma carries blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things to the whole body. Every part of the body needs these things to survive. If too much plasma leaks out of the blood vessels, there will not be enough left to carry these things to the body's most important organs. Without these things, the organs cannot work normally. This is called dengue shock syndrome.\nPlasma also carries platelets, which help the blood clot (they help stop bleeding). If a person does not have enough platelets, they can have dangerous bleeding. With dengue fever, this bleeding usually happens in the gastrointestinal tract. When a person has bleeding, leaking plasma, and not enough platelets, they have dengue hemorrhagic fever. (\"Hemorrhage\" means \"dangerous bleeding.\")\nThe recovery stage.\nThe recovery stage is when the patient's body is overcoming the disease process. In this stage, the plasma that leaked out of the blood vessels is taken back up into the bloodstream. This stage usually lasts 2 to 3 days.\nDuring this stage, people with dengue often feel much better. However, they can have very bad itching and a slow heart rate.\nSerious problems can also happen during the recovery stage. If a person's body takes too much fluid back up into the bloodstream, this can cause \"fluid overload.\" This can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, which causes breathing problems. Fluid overload can also cause seizures or an altered mental status (changes in a person's thinking and behavior).\nComplications.\nEvery once in a while, dengue can affect other systems in the body. For example, dengue can cause:\nCause.\nDengue fever is caused by the dengue virus. In the scientific system that classifies viruses, the dengue virus is part of the family \"Flaviviridae\" and the genus \"Flavivirus\". Other viruses that belong to the same family and can make humans sick include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.\nHow dengue is spread.\nDengue virus is spread mostly by mosquitoes from the \"Aedes\" genus, especially the \"Aedes aegypti\" species of mosquito. \"Aides aegypti\" is the most likely type of mosquito to spread dengue, because it likes to live close to humans and feed off of people instead of animals. A person can get the dengue virus from just one mosquito bite.\nSometimes, mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans. If a female mosquito bites someone with dengue, the mosquito may get the dengue virus from the person's blood. After about 8 to 10 days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands, which make saliva (or \"spit\"). Now the mosquito will make saliva that is infected with the dengue virus. When the mosquito bites a human, its infected saliva goes into the human and can give that person dengue.\nA person can also get the dengue virus if they get a blood transfusion or organ donation from someone who has the virus. In some countries where dengue is common, like Singapore, between 1.6 and 6 blood transfusions out of every 10,000 spread dengue.\nThe dengue virus can also be spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy, or when the child is born. This is called vertical transmission.\nDengue is usually not spread in any other ways.\nDengue virus in the human body.\nOnce a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, the virus attaches to and enters the person's white blood cells. (The white blood cells are part of the immune system, which defends the body by fighting off threats, like infections.) As the white blood cells move around the body, the virus makes copies of itself. The white blood cells react by making many special proteins, like interferon, which tell the immune system to work harder because there is a threat in the body. These proteins cause the fever, flu-like symptoms, and severe pains that happen with dengue.\nIf a person has a bad infection, the virus makes copies of itself much more quickly inside the body. Because there is a lot more of the virus, it can affect many more organs (like the liver and the bone marrow). The virus can stop the bone marrow from making platelets normally. This makes very bad bleeding much more likely to happen.\nRisk factors.\nBabies and young children with dengue are more likely than adults to become very sick. Women are more likely than men to get very sick. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic (long-lasting) diseases, like diabetes and asthma.\nThere are four different types of the dengue virus. Once a person has had one type of the virus, he usually is protected from that type for the rest of his life. However, he will only be protected against the other three types of the virus for a short time. If he later gets one of those three types of the virus, he will be more likely to have serious problems, like dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever.\nDiagnosis.\nUsually, doctors diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and realizing that their symptoms match dengue. However, when dengue is in its early stages, it can be difficult to tell the difference between this disease and other infections caused by viruses.\nThe World Health Organization says that a person probably has dengue if:\nThe World Health Organization also says that in areas where dengue is common, any warning signs, plus a fever, usually signal that a person has dengue fever.\nBlood tests.\nSome blood tests show changes when a person has dengue fever. The earliest change is a low number of white blood cells in the blood. A low number of platelets can also signal dengue. Special blood tests can look for the dengue virus itself; the virus's nucleic acids; or the antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the virus. However, these special tests are expensive. Also, in many areas where dengue is common, most doctors and clinics do not have laboratories for blood tests or special machines.\nIt can be difficult to tell the difference between dengue fever and chikungunya. Chikungunya is a similar viral infection that has many of the same symptoms of dengue, and happens in the same parts of the world. Dengue can also have some of the same symptoms as other diseases, like malaria, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease. Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their doctor will do tests to make sure they do not actually have one of these diseases instead.\nWHO classification systems.\nIn 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a system for describing the different types of dengue fever. Eventually, the WHO decided that this old way of dividing dengue needed to be simpler. It also decided that not everyone with dengue fever fit into the old categories.\nIn 2009, the WHO changed its system for classifying (dividing) dengue fever. However, the older system often is still used.\nThe old system.\nThe WHO's old system divided dengue into three categories:\nThe new system.\nIn 2009, the WHO created a simpler system which divided dengue fever into two types: \nPrevention.\nThere are no vaccines that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. The best ways to prevent dengue are to protect people from mosquito bites and to control the mosquito population.\nThe best way to control the mosquito is to get rid of its (the places it lives) The best way to do this is to get rid of areas with standing water (water that does not move). Mosquitoes like standing water and often lay its eggs, to prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, people can: \nIntegrated Vector Control.\nThe WHO suggests a program for preventing dengue (called an \"Integrated Vector Control\" program) that includes five different parts: \nTreatment.\nThere are no specific treatments for dengue fever. No known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) will kill the dengue virus. Health workers can give \"supportive treatment\" - treat dengue's symptoms to try to make patients feel better.\nDifferent people need different treatments, depending on their symptoms. Some people can get better just by drinking fluids at home, and checking with their doctor to make sure they are getting better.\nTreating dehydration is very important. Sometimes, people are so dehydrated that they need intravenous fluids - fluids given through a needle placed into a vein. Usually, people only need intravenous fluids for a day or two.\nDoctors can give medicines like acetaminophen (paracetamol) for fever and pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin should not be used because they make bleeding more likely.\nPeople with bad dengue may need blood transfusions. Having extra blood will help a person if their blood pressure is getting very low (like it does in dengue shock syndrome) or if they do not have enough red blood cells in their blood (because they are bleeding from dengue hemorrhagic fever).\nWhen people reach the recovery stage of dengue, doctors usually stop giving intravenous fluids to prevent fluid overload (having too much fluid in the body). If a person gets fluid overload, doctors can give a type of medication called a diuretic, which will make the patient urinate out the extra fluid.\nPrognosis.\nMost people with dengue recover and don't have any problems afterward.\nWithout treatment, 1% to 5% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 100) die from dengue. With good treatment, less than 1% die. However, 26% of people with severe dengue die.\nEpidemiology.\nDengue is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, it infects 50 to 100 million people around the world. It also causes half a million hospitalizations and about 12,500 to 25,000 deaths around the world each year. However, the World Health Organization says that dengue fever is not taken as seriously as it should be. It calls dengue one of 16 \"neglected tropical diseases\" - diseases which do not get enough attention. In every million people, dengue causes about 1600 years of life to be lost. This is about the same as other tropical and deadly diseases, like tuberculosis. However, the WHO says the neglected tropical diseases, like dengue, do not get the attention and money that is needed to find treatments and cures.\nDengue is becoming much more common around the world. It is the most common viral disease that is spread by arthropods. In 2010, dengue was 30 times more common than it was in 1960. Scientists think dengue may be getting more common because:\nDengue happens most around the equator. 2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue happens. 70% of these people live in Asia and the Pacific. In the United States, 2.9% to 8% of people who come back from traveling in areas where dengue happens, and have a fever, were infected while traveling. In this group of people, dengue is the second most common infection to be diagnosed, after malaria.\nHistory.\nDengue fever is probably a very old disease. An ancient Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (which existed from 265 to 420 AD) talked about a person who probably had dengue. The book talked about a \"water poison\" that had to do with flying insects.\nWritten records from the 17th century talk about what may have been epidemics of dengue (where the disease spread very quickly in a short time). The most likely early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780. These reports talk about an epidemic that spread across Asia, Africa, and North America. From that time until 1940, there were not many more epidemics.\nIn 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infections from \"Aedes\" mosquitoes. In 1907, scientists showed that a virus causes dengue. This was just the second disease that was shown to be caused by a virus. (The first was yellow fever.) John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler kept studying the dengue virus, and figured out the basics of how the virus spreads.\nDengue began to spread much more quickly during and after World War II. Different types of dengue also spread to new areas. For the first time, people started to get dengue hemorrhagic fever. The first case of dengue hemorrhagic fever happened in the Philippines in 1953. By the 1970s, dengue hemorrhagic fever had become a major cause of death in children. It also spread to the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central America and South America in 1981.\nHistory of the word.\nIt is not clear where the word \"dengue\" came from. Some people think that it comes from the Swahili phrase \"Ka-dinga pepo\". This phrase talks about the disease being caused by an evil spirit. The Swahili word \"dinga\" is thought to come from the Spanish word \"dengue\", which means \"careful.\" That word may have been used to describe a person having bone pain from dengue fever; that pain would make the person walk carefully. However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili word, and not the other way around.\nOther people think that the name \"dengue\" comes from the West Indies. In the West Indies, slaves that had dengue were said to stand and walk like \"a dandy.\" Because of this, the disease was also called \"dandy fever.\"\nThe name \"breakbone fever\" was first used by Benjamin Rush, a doctor and United States \"Founding Father.\" In 1789, Rush used the name \"breakbone fever\" in a report about the 1780 dengue outbreak in Philadelphia. In his official report, Rush mostly used the more formal name \"bilious remitting fever\".\nThe term \"dengue fever\" was not commonly used until after 1828. Before that, different people used different names for the disease. For example, dengue was also called \"breakheart fever\" and \"la dengue.\" Other names were also used for severe dengue: for example, \"infectious thrombocytopenic purpura\", \"Philippine,\" \"Thai,\" and \"Singapore hemorrhagic fever.\"\nResearch.\nScientists keep doing research on ways to prevent and treat dengue. People are also working on controlling mosquitoes, creating a vaccine, and creating drugs to fight the virus.\nMany simple things have been done to control mosquitoes. Some of these things have worked. For example, guppies (\"Poecilia reticulata\") or copepods can be put in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae (eggs).\nScientists also keep working on creating antiviral drugs to treat attacks of dengue fever and keep people from getting severe complications. They are also working on figuring out how the virus's proteins are structured. This may help them create medications that work well for dengue."}

It is named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.\nThe equation is:\nwhere v is the speed of the object and c is the speed of light. The quantity (v/c) is often labeled formula_2 (beta) and so the above equation can be rewritten:\nClassical relativity.\nClassical or Galilean relativity is the idea that if you throw a ball at 50\u00a0mph while running at 5\u00a0mph, the ball travels 55\u00a0mph. Of course, the ball still moves away from you at 50\u00a0mph, so if one were to ask you, you \"saw\" the ball traveling 50\u00a0mph. Meanwhile, your friend Rory saw that you happened to be running at 5\u00a0mph. He would say that the ball was traveling 55\u00a0mph. Both of you are right, you just happened to be moving \"with\" the ball.\nThe speed of light, c, is 670,616,629\u00a0mph. So if you are in a car traveling half the speed of light (0.5c) and you turn on your headlights, the light moves away from you at 1 c... or is it 1.5 c? It ends up that c is c no matter what. The next section explains why it's not c - 0.5c.\nTime dilation.\nWhen a clock is in motion, it ticks slower by a tiny factor of formula_4. The famous twin paradox says that if there were two twins and twin A stayed on earth while twin B traveled near c for a few years, when twin B got back to earth, he would be many years younger than twin A (because he experienced less time). For example, if twin B left when he was 20 and traveled at .9c for 10 years, then when he got back to earth, twin B would be 30 (20 years + 10 years) and twin A would be almost 43:\nTwin B would not notice that time had slowed at all. To him, if he looked out a window, it would seem like the universe was moving past him, and therefore slower (remember, to him, he's at rest). So time is relative.\nLength contraction.\nThings get shorter in the direction of movement when they travel at relativistic speeds. During twin B's journey, he would notice something strange about the universe. He would notice that it got shorter (contracted in the direction of his motion). And the factor by which things get shorter is formula_4.\nRelativistic mass.\nRelativistic mass also increases. It makes them harder to push. So by the time you reach 0.9999c, you need a very big force to make you go faster. This makes it impossible for anything to reach the speed of light.\nStill, if you travel a bit slower, say 90% of the speed of light, your mass only grows by 2.3 times. So, while it may be impossible to reach the speed of light, it may still be possible to get close to it\u2014that is, if you have enough fuel."}

Tasers are used by police officers to stop people who want to hurt them, and to stop people who are running away.\nHow Tasers work.\nTasers shoot two small pieces of metal called prongs. These prongs are connected to long pieces of metal string. When the Taser is shot, the prongs hit the person and electricity moves along the metal string to shock the person.\nIf a person is very close, the prongs do not have to shoot but they will still shock.\nSafety.\nEven though a Taser is a weapon that is not meant to kill, the prongs can still hurt people. There are some times when people die after they are shot with a Taser. This is because some people get hurt differently by electricity.\nOwning Tasers.\nIn many places, people cannot own a Taser.

Animals may be trapped for a variety of purposes, including food, wildlife management, hunting and pest control. Each year, over 5 million wild animals, including coyotes, foxes and bobcats, are caught and killed in wild traps, mainly in the US, Canada and Russia, although trapping does occur in other countries too on a smaller scale. Traps are indiscriminate, catching the first animal to step on them. Countless dogs and cats, deer, birds and other animals\u2014including threatened and endangered animals\u2014are also injured and killed each year by the traps. Trap checking times range from once every 24 hours to once every 14 days. The regulations on trapping are weak and extremely difficult to enforce, which means untold amounts of animal suffering goes undocumented and uninvestigated. \nMany animals die trying to free themselves, next to dehydration, blood loss and hypothermia. Often animals become so desperate, they resort to chewing or wringing off their own trapped limb in order to escape, breaking teeth and bones in the process. Some may die from blood loss or shock but most animals will be trapped for days before the trapper returns to kill them. \nThere are many kinds. For a deadfall trap, a trapper digs a deep hole in the ground and hides it so the animal falls in the hole and can not get out. A snare is a noose that tightens around the neck or other part of the animal.\nOver 100 countries, including the EU and China, have prohibited the use of the steel-jaw leghold trap. But in the United States, steel-jaw traps are not only legal, they are the go-to tool for trappers who capture and kill millions of wild animals a year for the global fur market. In September 2019, California became the first state in the US to ban trapping for commercial and recreational purpose."}

This tends to happen at low velocities when there are few disturbances, such as in a straight, smooth pipe. In laminar flow through a pipe, it is assumed that the velocity of the fluid is zero at the boundaries of the pipe and is at a maximum in the center; mathematically, the velocity profile is parabolic. Microscopically, the particles or pieces of the liquid flow in a straight line along the direction of the pipe and do not mix with other layers of fluid. The layers slide past one another like playing cards. This is in contrast to turbulent flow, when a fluid swirls around.\nEven though there is no mixing, there is still some friction in the flow. This friction will cause a pressure drop and its numerical value is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation."}

Many psychologists try to find out what rules people use when they decide that two things are similar.\nModeling.\nOne important tool used by psychologists to look into similarity is computer modeling. Scientists will, for example, ask people to rate a number of objects as more or less similar to each other. Then they will write a computer program that tries to simulate the same answers that the humans gave. For instance, a person might say that \"cat\" and \"dog\" are similar words, so a good computer model should be able to take the word \"dog\" and respond with the word \"cat\" in a list of similar words. Computer models do this by applying some set of rules to a large collection of real world text (called a corpus).\nOnce a model can respond with the correct (similar) words, then it is likely that the rules the computer program uses are the same rules that people use to decide whether words are similar.\nBehavioral research.\nAnother way that psychologists look into similarity is by putting people in special situations and watching what they do. In other words, by using an experiment. When it comes to similarity, this might include listing words, using categories as clues for learning new words, sorting objects into groups, or other tasks that have to do with comparing things to one another.\nDepending on how quickly people do these tasks, or how many mistakes they make, psychologists can find out what rules they are using to decide if things are similar."}

He uses a type of theory called critical theory, where he studies how people use power. He also uses the theory of American pragmatism, which studies if something is true or not by the effects of actions. He is known for his work on the theory of the public sphere. He studies power in democracy, and politics. He also studies how people develop a society through language and communication, and tries to understand how that society and the government work together.\nBiography.\nHabermas was born in D\u00fcsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.\nHabermas lived in Gummersbach, near the city of Cologne until his graduation from gymnasium. J\u00fcrgen was raised in a Protestant religious family because his grandfather was in charge of the seminary, or religious school, in Gummersbach, Germany. J\u00fcrgen Habermas went to the universities of G\u00f6ttingen (1949/50), Z\u00fcrich (1950/51), and Bonn (1951/54). He earned a doctorate (PhD). from Bonn in 1954 with his work \"\" (The absolute and history: on the contradiction in Schelling's thought). \nFrom 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. Because Horkheimer had asked Habermas to make some changes to his dissertation. Habermas did not want to do this, and thought that the Frankfurt School was not correct in its views of modern culture. Habermas left the Frankfurt School (a school of thought rather than one made of bricks and mortar). \nHe finished his \"habilitation\", or highest academic degree, in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth. His \"habilitation\" work was entitled, \"\" (published in English in 1989 titled \"The structural transformation of the public sphere: an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society\"). In 1961, he became a \"privatdozent\" in Marburg. He began working as a \"extraordinary professor\" (professor without a chair) of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl L\u00f6with got him this job. In 1964 Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's job in philosophy and sociology.\nHe was in charge of the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his main work, \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt as head of the Institute for Social Research. After retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas wrote many books and articles. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the , which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He is a \"Permanent Visiting\" Professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and \"Theodor Heuss Professor\" at The New School, New York.\nHabermas was awarded The Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences for 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate in the Arts and Philosophy section. He traveled to San Diego and on March 5, 2005, as part of the University of San Diego's Kyoto Symposium, gave a speech entitled \"The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context\", about the separation of Church and State.

It happened at a Union Carbide subsidiary pesticide plant in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. On the night of 2-3 December 1984, the plant released approximately 40 tonnes of toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas, exposing more than 500,000 people to toxic gases. \nA mixture of poisonous gases flooded the city, causing great panic as people woke up with a burning sensation in their lungs. Thousands died immediately from the effects of the gas. Many were trampled in the panic that followed. The first official immediate death toll was 3,598 in 1989. Another estimate is that 8,000 died within two weeks, that an additional 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases.\nThe Bhopal disaster is frequently cited as the world's worst industrial disaster. The International Medical Commission on Bhopal was established in 1993 to respond to the long term health effects of the disaster. The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million ($929 million in 2017 dollars) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to EverReady Industries India Limited (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.\nCivil and criminal cases were filed in the District Court of Bhopal, India, involving UCC and Warren Anderson, UCC CEO at the time of the disaster.[7][8] In June 2010, seven former employees, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by Indian law. An eighth former employee was also convicted but died before the judgment was passed.[2] Anderson died on 29 September 2014. (9)\nHistory.\nIn the 1970s, the Indian government initiated policies to encourage foreign companies to invest in the local industry. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) was asked to build a plant for the manufacture of Sevin, a pesticide commonly used throughout Asia. As part of the deal, India's government insisted that a significant percentage of the investment come from local shareholders. The government itself had a 22% stake in the company's subsidiary, Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) [1]. The company built the plant in Bhopal because of its central location and access to transport infrastructure. The specific site within the city was zoned for light industrial and commercial use, not for hazardous industry. The plant was initially approved only for formulation of pesticides from component chemicals, such as MIC imported from the parent company, in relatively small quantities. However, pressure from competition in the chemical industry led UCIL to implement \"backward integration\" \u2013 the manufacture of raw materials and intermediate products for formulation of the final product within one facility. This was inherently a more sophisticated and hazardous process [2].\nIn 1984, the plant was manufacturing Sevin at one quarter of its production capacity due to decreased demand for pesticides. Widespread crop failures and famine on the subcontinent in the 1980s led to increased indebtedness and decreased capital for farmers to invest in pesticides. Local managers were directed to close the plant and prepare it for sale in July 1984 due to decreased profitability [3]. When no ready buyer was found, UCIL made plans to dismantle key production units of the facility for shipment to another developing country. In the meantime, the facility continued to operate with safety equipment and procedures far below the standards found in its sister plant in Institute, West Virginia. The local government was aware of safety problems but was reticent to place heavy industrial safety and pollution control burdens on the struggling industry because it feared the economic effects of the loss of such a large employer [3].\nAt 11.00 PM on December 2 1984, while most of the one million residents of Bhopal slept, an operator at the plant noticed a small leak of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas and increasing pressure inside a storage tank. The vent-gas scrubber, a safety device designer to neutralize toxic discharge from the MIC system, had been turned off three weeks prior [3]. Apparently a faulty valve had allowed one ton of water for cleaning internal pipes to mix with forty tons of MIC [1]. A 30 ton refrigeration unit that normally served as a safety component to cool the MIC storage tank had been drained of its coolant for use in another part of the plant [3]. Pressure and heat from the vigorous exothermic reaction in the tank continued to build. The gas flare safety system was out of action and had been for three months. At around 1.00 AM, December 3, loud rumbling reverberated around the plant as a safety valve gave way sending a plume of MIC gas into the early morning air [4]. Within hours, the streets of Bhopal were littered with human corpses and the carcasses of buffaloes, cows, dogs and birds. An estimated 3,800 people died immediately, mostly in the poor slum colony adjacent to the UCC plant [1,5]. Local hospitals were soon overwhelmed with the injured, a crisis further compounded by a lack of knowledge of exactly what gas was involved and what its effects were [1]. It became one of the worst chemical disasters in history and the name Bhopal became synonymous with industrial catastrophe [5].\nEstimates of the number of people killed in the first few days by the plume from the UCC plant run as high as 10,000, with 15,000 to 20,000 premature deaths reportedly occurring in the subsequent two decades [6]. The Indian government reported that more than half a million people were exposed to the gas [7]. Several epidemiological studies conducted soon after the accident showed significant morbidity and increased mortality in the exposed population. Table Table1.1. summarizes early and late effects on health. These data are likely to under-represent the true extent of adverse health effects because many exposed individuals left Bhopal immediately following the disaster never to return and were therefore lost to follow-up [8].\nCauses.\nThe plant in Bhopal where the disaster happened started to produce 'Carbaryl' in 1977. Carbaryl is mainly used as an insecticide. At first, the production was 2,500 tonnes per year. There was no problem, as the plant had been designed for an output of 5,000 tonnes. At the beginning of the 1980s, Carbaryl did not sell very well. For this reason, the owners of the plant started to cut the costs. This included employing fewer people, doing maintenance less frequently, and using parts that were made of lower-grade steel. Closing the plant was being considered as well. When the disaster happened, there was no production at the plant because there was a surplus amount of material on the market. \nThere is also a theory related to this which says that the owner of the Union Carbide Company (UCC) did this on purpose to just challenge the government to punish him. However, as we all know, he had escaped long ago using the corruption in the Indian government at that time to his advantage. \nThe disaster happened because water entered Methyl isocyanate. The resulting reaction increased the temperature inside the tank to reach over . The pressure was more than the tank. The tank had two places to restore the gas. As a result, large amounts of toxic gases were released into the environment. The pipes were not well maintained. All the contents of the tank were released within a period of about two hours. The water had entered the tank because of a sequence of events. The tank had been maintained badly. When cleaning work was done, water entered the tank.\nTheories.\nThere are different theories on how water could enter the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning pipes with water. Some claim that because of bad maintenance and leaking valves, inferior components were used in the making of machines, and also low maintenance of the machines made it possible for the water to leak into tank 610. In December 1985 the New York Times reported that according to the plant managers the hypothesis of this route of entry of water was tested in the presence of official investigators and was found to be negative. UCC also maintains that this route was not possible and that it was an act of sabotage by a \"disgruntled worker\" who introduced water directly into the tank.

The reports differ in details, however. \nThe problem was then made worse by the plant's location near a densely populated area, non-existent catastrophe plans, and shortcomings in health care and socio-economic reh\nFactors leading to this gas leak include:\nabilitation. Analysis shows that the parties responsible for the magnitude of the disaster are the two owners, Union Carbide Corporation and the Government of India, and to some extent, the Government of Madhya Pradesh.\nCasualties.\nBetween 3,500 and 25,000 people died as a result of contact with the cloud of toxic gas. Up to 500,000 people were injured. Many of the injuries are permanent. Some of the chemicals led to birth defects. The numbers vary so vastly because there are no exact figures about how many people lived in the neighborhood of the plant. About 100.000 people were living in a radius of 1 km around the plant where the disaster happened. The owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority-owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million ($929 million in 2017 dollars) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to EverReady Industries India Limited (EIIL), which subsequently merged with McLeod Russel (India) Ltd. EverReady ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh. Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC in 2001, seventeen years after the disaster.\nCivil and criminal cases were filed in the District Court of Bhopal, India, involving UCC and Warren Anderson, UCC CEO at the time of the disaster.[7][8] In June 2010, seven former employees, including the former UCIL chairman, were convicted in Bhopal of causing death by negligence and sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of about $2,000 each, the maximum punishment allowed by Indian law. An eighth former employee was also convicted, but died before the judgement was passed.[2] Anderson died on 29 September 2014.[9]\nAftermath.\nIn 1998, the Supreme Court of India reached a settlement with Union Carbide: They had to pay 470 million US dollars to the Indian state. At that time Union Carbide made a turnover of about 9.5 billion dollars, 20 times that amount. In return, there would be no further prosecution. Only very little money actually reached the victims. \nThe terrain where the plant stands is still contaminated with mercury and other carcinogenic substances. Dow Chemical who owns Union Carbide refuses to decontaminate the soil. Greenpeace has estimated that decontamination would only cost around 30 million USD.\nAbstract.\nOn December 3, 1984, more than 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, immediately killing at least 3,800 people and causing significant morbidity and premature death for many thousands more. The company involved in what became the worst industrial accident in history immediately tried to dissociate itself from legal responsibility. Eventually, it reached a settlement with the Indian Government through the mediation of that country's Supreme Court and accepted moral responsibility. It paid $470 million in compensation, a relatively small amount of based on significant underestimations of the long-term health consequences of exposure and the number of people exposed. The disaster indicated a need for enforceable international standards for environmental safety, preventative strategies to avoid similar accidents, and industrial disaster preparedness.\nSince the disaster, India has experienced rapid industrialization. While some positive changes in government policy and behavior of a few industries have taken place, major threats to the environment from rapid and poorly regulated industrial growth remain. Widespread environmental degradation with significant adverse human health consequences continues to occur throughout India.\nDecember 2004 marked the twentieth anniversary of the massive toxic gas leak from Union Carbide Corporation's chemical plant in Bhopal in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India that killed more than 3,800 people. This review examines the health effects of exposure to the disaster, the legal response, the lessons learned, and whether or not these are put into practice in India in terms of industrial development, environmental management, and public health."}

It started around World War 1. Although not at first an art movement,p60/61 it did influence art greatly for a time. \nHistory.\nThe movement, formed in Zurich, Switzerland, was heavily influenced by the war in Europe. Its artists rejected modern capitalist society. They used nonsense and protest in their works. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence, war, and nationalism, and were close to the radical far-left. The whole point behind Dadaism was to prove that anything could be art if the artist declared it to be. This was to prove that if everything could be art, then nothing could be art. This outraged many artists as Dadaism deemed their labour intensive artworks meaningless. \nThe art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture.\nInfluence.\nIts peak was 1916 to 1922, and it influenced surrealism, pop art, and punk rock. It went against the standards of society.\nFollowers of Dadaism included Antonin Artaud, Max Ernst, and Salvador Dali. A later version, called \"Neo-Dada\", arose in the 1960s.\nDadaism began in central Europe, in Berlin and Zurich. Dadaism moved to Paris with Tristan Tzara. Tzara would go on to 'lead' the dadaists of Paris such as as Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, and Marcel Duchamp. \nDadaism is also closely associated with the concepts of the grotesque, the absurd, and the macabre. The idea of ridiculing the absurdity of existence has its expression in the dramatic art of Samuel Beckett and the so called school of Paris, which included Arthur Adamov, Jean Genet, and Eugene O'Neill.\nThe word \"Dada\" may be an allusion to an infant's first words, such as \"Mama\". No-one knows who invented the name, but there is some historical evidence which says that Tzara picked it out at random from a German-French dictionary, since \"Dada\" means \"hobbyhorse\" in French. A hobbyhorse is a long stick with a toy horse head attached which a child can hold in front of them to pretend they are riding a horse. Still, the source of the name is not widely agreed upon."}

The movement rejected realism and naturalism, and included poetry and other arts. Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus a symbolist painting may \"look\" realistic, but actually it represents a non-visual idea.\nIn literature, the style started with the publication \"Les Fleurs du mal\" (\"The Flowers of Evil\", 1857) by Charles Baudelaire. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images. The name \"symbolist\" itself was first used by the critic Jean Mor\u00e9as, who invented it to distinguish the symbolists from similar styles of literature and art. Symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism.\nThere were several groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, including Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussi\u00e8re, Edvard Munch, F\u00e9licien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry. Its ideas affected Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, L\u00e9on Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States. Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.\nThe symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis."}

It applies generally to all positions to which people may be appointed. It is often reinforced by laws, such as that women should have equal opportunities to men in employment.\nThe philosopher Plato thought that a government based on merit was better than democracy. In democracy, there is no guarantee that you will get the best person, the most qualified person, ruling the state. His criticisms were really of Athenian (or direct) democracy, where anyone could be selected to rule.\nIn a meritocracy, the people are chosen who are thought to be the best. Some have accused it of being elitist, saying that government by the best will mean that only those who have had the right opportunities will have a chance to govern, creating in effect a ruling class.\nIt is worth pointing out that Plato did not see it this way. He believed that philosophers were the best people to rule because they were \"disinterested\", meaning they only had the interests of the state in mind, not their own interest. Plato's point was this: if you want to rule, then it will go wrong, because power will corrupt you. If you are a philosopher, you don't care about power all you care about is truth, so you will rule well, without being interested in your power or status."}

It comes from the practice of mediaeval Popes, appointing their nephews to important positions. \"Nepote\" is Italian for 'nephew'.\nFor instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III. Paul III was a notorious nepotist. When elected Pope in 1534 he appointed two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. \nThe practice was finally ended when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull \"Romanum decet Pontificem\", in 1692. The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.\nIn the modern world, nepotism is thought to be wrong, and conflicts with the principle of merit, where the best person gets the job (meritocracy). The argument against the widespread nepotism in countries like Italy is that it damages the economy of the country, though that is difficult to prove."}

It teaches undergraduate, graduate, professional and continuing education students both in classrooms and online.\nPenn State University Park is ranked among the top-fifteen public universities in the United States. Annual enrollment at the main campus totals more than 44,000 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the United States. It has the world's largest dues-paying alumni association.\nThe university's total enrollment in 2009\u201310 was approximately 94,300 across its 24 campuses and online through its World Campus. The university offers more than 160 majors among all its campuses Penn State has a US$1.52 billion (as of April 30, 2010) endowment.

In fiscal year 2008, the National Science Foundation ranked Penn State 11th among U.S. universities in research income.\nPenn State is a school known for its football team. Penn State is a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nOrganization and administration.\nPenn State is a \"state-related\" university, part of Pennsylvania's Commonwealth System of Higher Education. It receives money from the Commonwealth. The state appoints 10 out of 32 people on its board of trustees. Penn State is independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006\u20132007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania. As Pennsylvania's land grant college, the state and federal governments provide matching funds for research and cooperative extension in agriculture, home economics and related fields.\nThe board of trustees selects a president of the University. The president controls the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, the president gives power to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body. Provost Rodney Erickson became interim President on November 9, 2011, after President Graham Spanier was fired.\nThe executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the University. As of 2011, the provost is Rodney Erickson, and the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean For Undergraduate Education is Jeremy Cohen.\nScandal.\nThe football team was led by coach Joe Paterno for 45 years. He was fired in 2011 along with the University President because they failed to report child abuse by a former assistant football coach. Former coach Jerry Sandusky was arrested on child abuse charges for the period 1994 to 2009. Both the Athletic Director and the vice president for business and finance were charged with perjury and resigned. The next day about 2,000 students rioted in protest, supporting coach Paterno. On November 11, the school staged a vigil to show support for the victims of child abuse.\nThe Education Secretary Arne Duncan said that colleges and universities have \"a legal and moral responsibility to protect children\", and that Penn State's failure to report the alleged abuse would be a \"tragedy\". The NCAA is considering sanctions against Penn State. Moody's Investors Service is reviewing Penn State's bond ratings for a possible downgrade. On November 14, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced that its Championship football trophy will no longer be named for Paterno. On November 13, 2011, President Barack Obama said, \"It's a good time for us to do some soul searching \u2013 every institution, not just Penn State \u2013 about what our priorities are, and making sure that we understand that our first priority is protecting our kids.\"\nSandusky has denied all charges against him, although he was convicted of all charges in October 2012 and sentenced to 30\u201360 years in prison.\nSports.\nPenn State's sports teams are nicknamed Nittany Lions, except for the women's basketball team, which is known as the Lady Lions. Almost all teams play in the Big Ten Conference. Two teams in sports that the Big Ten does not sponsor play elsewhere.

Judges, lawmakers, referees and teachers are among those expected to be fair in their decisions. Fairness is keeping decisions free from any form of discrimination.\nIn the United States fairness has long been a battle between equality and equity. Equality is the idea everyone should have an equal opportunity. If all the horses in a race start from the same point, the horse that wins is the fastest. Equity is the idea that adjustments need to be made to make things fair for both entities. One should get more than the other because that would be fair in this sense. For example, in the game of golf, when playing a skilled golfer, a less skilled golfer may be given a \"handicap\" (extra points) at the start of the game. This is to help make the final score fair for both players. "}

It is similar in this respect to ethology, which has always used ideas from evolutionary biology.\nAbstract.\nThis field seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations, that is, functional products of natural selection or sexual selection. Evolutionary psychology usually focuses on behaviour most people share. Some of the more common areas evolutionary psychology is focused on are sex, and social behaviour. Events like violent behaviour need explanation in evolutionary terms.\nEvolutionary psychology is related to other fields of science like sociobiology, social psychology, and sociocultural anthropology. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behaviour is the result of adaptations which evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.\nThe adaptationist approach is steadily increasing as an influence in the general field of psychology. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviours or traits which occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. This includes our ability to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. They report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to such topics as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment."}

Ageism is often common in the entertainment industry where what a person looks like is felt by many to be important.\nThere are two targets for age discrimination: old people (also called senior citizens) and young people. Discrimination against old and young people can happen at places like job interviews. For example, a company might hire a worker who is about 30 years old instead of someone who is about 50 years old, or someone who is around 20 years old, regardless of skill level. Another common example of ageism is not allowing \"minors\", or young people, to vote, drink, drive, work, marry, gamble, or give sexual consent."}

It has the chemical formula KNO3. It contains potassium and nitrate ions. It is often called saltpeter. \nProperties.\nPotassium nitrate is a colorless solid. It dissolves in water. It is a common source of the nitrate ion. Potassium nitrate is a strong oxidizer. It decomposes to potassium nitrite and oxygen when heated. Its pH is almost neutral. It burns with a lilac flame.\nProduction.\nIt can be made by reacting ammonium nitrate with potassium hydroxide. It can also be made by reacting potassium chloride with ammonium nitrate. It might be made by reacting potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate with nitric acid. \nOccurrence.\nSaltpeter is a mineral form of potassium nitrate. It is only found in very dry areas. It is one of the few minerals that have nitrogen in them. \nUses.\nPotassium nitrate is used in explosives. Oxygen from the air is the most common chemical that is used for oxidation, which is how most fires and explosions happen. Some explosions will use up oxygen so quickly, though, that there is not enough to finish the reaction, and the explosion is not very strong. Potassium nitrate replaces the need for oxygen and takes up much less space, which lets the explosion be stronger and faster. It is a main ingredient of gunpowder.\nPotassium nitrate is also used in rocket fuel for the same reason as in explosives, except that the goal is to let the fuel burn longer, not faster. Potassium nitrate is used as a fertilizer, to help plants grow faster and grow in more places where it might be hard for them to grow otherwise. It can also be used to decay tree stumps.\nSafety.\nPotassium nitrate is a poison and will cause permanent injury when improperly handled. It also can start fires and explosions easily."}

Lots of people think that finding a proof of the hypothesis is one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics. Pure mathematics is a type of mathematics that is about thinking about mathematics. This is different from trying to put mathematics into the real world. The answer to the Riemann hypothesis is \"yes\" or \"no\". \nThe conjecture is named after a man called Bernhard Riemann. He lived in the 1800s. The Riemann hypothesis asks a question about a special thing called the Riemann zeta function. \nIf the answer to the question is \"yes\", this would mean mathematicians can know more about prime numbers. Specifically, it would help them know how to find prime numbers. The Riemann hypothesis is so important, and so difficult to prove, that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered $1,000,000 to the first person to prove it. \nWhat is the Riemann hypothesis?\nWhat is the Riemann zeta function?\nThe Riemann zeta function is a kind of function. Functions are things in mathematics like equations. Functions take in numbers and give you other numbers back. This is like how you get a answer back when you ask a question. The number you put in is called an \"input\". The number you get back is called a \"value\". Every input you put into the Riemann zeta function gives you a special value back. You mostly get a different value for each input. But each input gives you the same value every time you use it. Both the input you give, and the value you get, from the Riemann zeta function are special numbers called complex numbers. A complex number is a number with two parts, a real part and an imaginary part. The imaginary part is called imaginary because you would have to \"imagine\" such a number as formula_1 that when multiplied by itself is equal to formula_2. Because based on the rules of arithmetic formula_3 and formula_4 no such number could exist, it would have to be imagined. Imaginary numbers have vast use in mathematics; without them a lot of technologies would not be possible. As a tangible example, in order to use quadratic formula to solve some equations, the answer sometimes has to be an imaginary number, and historically this was the reason why imaginary numbers were invented in the first place.\nWhat is a non-trivial root?\nSometimes when you put an input into the Riemann zeta function, you get the number zero back. When this happens, you call that input a root of the Riemann zeta function. You call the input a \"root\" when it gives you zero. Lots of roots have been found. But some roots are easier to find than others. We call the roots \"trivial\" or \"non-trivial\". We call a root \"trivial\" if it is easy to find. But we call a root \"non-trivial\" if its hard to find. The trivial roots are numbers called \"negative even integers\". The reason we think they are easy is because they are easy to find. There are neat rules that say what the trivial roots are. We know what the trivial roots are because of the equation that Bernhard Riemann gave. That equation was called \"Riemann's functional equation\".\nHow do we find non-trivial roots?\nThe non-trivial roots are harder to find. They are harder to find than the trivial roots. They don't have the same neat rules that say what they are. Even though they are hard to find, lots of non-trivial roots have been found. Remember that the value of the Riemann zeta function was a kind of number called a complex number. And remember that complex numbers have two parts. One of these parts is called the \"real part\". We noticed an interesting thing about the real part of the non-trivial roots. All the non-trivial roots we found have a real part that is the same number. This number is 1/2, which is a fraction. This takes us to Riemann's big question, which is about how big the real parts are. This question is the Riemann hypothesis. The question is \"do all the non-trivial roots have real part 1/2?\". We are still trying to find out if the answer is \"yes\" or \"no\".\nWhat do we know so far?\nWe do not know the answer to the question yet. But we do know some good facts. These facts might help us. There is a way we can find facts about the real parts of the non-trivial roots. This is with Riemann's special equation (Riemann's functional equation). Riemann's functional equation tells us about the size of the real parts. It says that all the non-trivial zeros have a real part close to 1/2. It says how small the real parts can be, and how big they can be. But it doesn't say \"exactly\" what they are. Specifically, it says the real parts have to be bigger than 0. But they have to be less than 1. But we still don't know if there might be a non-trivial root with a real part very close to 1/2. Maybe there is but we just have not found it yet. The group of complex numbers that have a real part bigger than 0 but smaller than 1 is called the \"critical strip\". \nThe Riemann hypothesis in a picture.\nThe picture in the top-right corner of this page shows the Riemann zeta function. The non-trivial roots are shown with the white dots. They look like they're all in a line down the very middle of the picture. They're not too far to the left and not too far to the right. The real part is how far left-to-right you are. Being in the middle of the picture means they have a real part of 1/2. So all the non-trivial roots in the picture have a real part of 1/2. But our picture doesn't show everything because the Riemann zeta function is too big to show. So what about the non-trivial roots above and below the picture? Would they be in the middle too? What if they break the pattern of being in the middle? They could be slightly to the left or right. The Riemann hypothesis asks if \"every\" non-trivial root (white dot) would be on the line down the middle. If the answer is no, we say the \"hypothesis is false\". This would mean that there are white dots which are not on the line given. "}

Other clubs do not. They are broadly the same type of dog.

Sir Charles Baskerville, the last of his Baskerville family was an elderly man. He believed that there was a curse on the family. In 1647 his ancestor, Hugo Baskerville, had attempted to catch a young woman whom he carried off; the girl had died of fear while Hugo was killed by a gigantic hound. Sir Charles Baskerville died of a heart attack while apparently fleeing a gigantic hound. As he was unmarried with no heirs, his estate goes to his nephew, Henry Baskerville, of Canada who is arriving in London. Although Holmes is not superstitious he does decide to take the case. Upon meeting the heir, several odd things happen: an unsigned note is delivered to Henry Baskerville warning him to stay away from the moor; then Henry's shoes beginning missing and turning up; first a new shoe and then an old one; lastly Holmes spots a stranger in a cab following Henry and Dr Mortimor.\nHolmes cannot go to Devon so he sends Dr Watson in his place as both a bodyguard to Sir Henry and as a spy. Dr Watson reports the eccentric happenings in Devon: the Baskerville's butler Barrymore and his wife who act strangely; Jack Stapleton an ex-schoolmaster and eccentric butterfly collector and his sister Beryl; a local busybody/and crank Frankland and his estranged daughter Laura Lyons. Lastly there is a deranged convict escapee named Sheldon on the moor. Beryl Stapleton first mistakes Watson for Sir Henry, warning him to go away; when she meets Sir Henry who begins to be attracted to her; although her brother strongly objects to their meeting together. Watson and Sir Henry find out the reason for the Barrymores strange actions, they are secretly helping Mrs Barrymore's brother, the escaped convict. Barrymore does reveal that he accidentally found a burned note to Charles Baskerville asking him to meet outside the hall from someone named L.L.\nWatson confronts Laura Lyons who admits that Charles Baskerville had financed her typewriting business and says she did not meet him on the night of his death. Watson is also confronted by Franklin who claims that he saw the escaped convict on the moor hiding in a old stone hut. Watson decides to investigate and finds the stranger is none other than Holmes! Holmes reveals that his prime suspect is Stapleton, who is the husband not the brother of Beryl. When they hear a scream they run out to find a dead man at the foot of a cliff. It is Sheldon the convict who was wearing Henry Baskerville old clothes. After meeting Stapleton, Holmes and Watson go to Baskerville Hall where Holmes tells Sir Henry to keep his dinner engagement with the Stapletons for the next night, although neither Holmes or Watson can go with Sir Henry as they must leave for London. Instead of leaving for London, Holmes and Watson confront Laura Lyons who is forced to admit that Stapleton had promised marriage to her. The meeting with Sir Charles was to have been a loan connected with her divorce expenses. It was Stapleton who persuaded her not to meet with Sir Charles at the last second and also to keep quiet about the note. Holmes and Watson meet Inspector Lestrade who has a arrest warrant. That night the three men spy on Stapleton and Sir Henry; when Sir Henry leaves to walk home, a gigantic glowing hound nearly attacks him but is killed by Holmes and Watson. At Stapleton's house they find Beryl who has been tied up and beaten by Stapleton. Stapleton flees to the moor but falls into the Grimpen Mire.\nHolmes reveals his deductive reasoning: the warning note had a woman's perfume scent; the theft of the shoes gave a clue that the dog was real; Stapleton, who was a spiritual and physical throwback to Hugo Baskerville (Holmes noticed the resemblance to the family portraits); his real name was Rodger Baskerville Jr (his father was the youngest of the Baskerville brothers and had to flee England for Central America). After marring a local beauty Beryl Garcia, he had stolen public money and fled Central America to England in 1885 where he used the money to start a public school in Yorkshire. The tutor he had hired died of consumption and the school which Baskerville then tried to use to teach his pupils crime was forced to close after an epidemic killed three students. In 1887 He then fled to his ancestrial home in Devon with the remains of his fortune, his wife and his taste for Entomology; Holmes cannot prove it but he theorizes that Baskerville supported himself by burglaries and in the process committed a murder. When he found out that one life was between him and a valuable estate and that Sir Charles had both a weak heart and took the family legend seriously, he bought a large savage dog and hid it on the moor. He tricked Laura Lyons into writing the appointment note for Sir Charles and sent the dog, coated with phosphorous, after the old man who died of a heart attack. He tried the same trick on his cousin Henry twice-the first time however it was the convict wearing Henry clothing that fell victim. He had tied up his wife so she could not warn Sir Henry of the danger he was in. In Holmes words: Roger Baskerville aka Jack Stapleton has for years been a dangerous and desperate man and one of the few foes worthy of confronting Sherlock Holmes The others being Dr Grimesby Roylott and Professor Moriaty)."}

It was created in 1935 by Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz, a Portuguese neurologist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 \"for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses\". The operation cut the connections from the pre-frontal cortex (front part of the frontal lobes) to the rest of the brain. At first it seemed a great success, but the operation is now rarely done.\nHe used the method for certain types of mental illness for which there was no other treatment. He first used it on patients with obsessive behaviour, which they repeated time and again. It was also used to treat other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and clinical depression. \nThe problem with lobotomies was that they forever changed a person's personality and behaviour. Sometimes, the results were beneficial: patients which had been violent became calm. But long-term studies, which were not done by Moniz, show some had severely damaged personalities. They often had very little 'drive' and motivation.\nToday, antipsychotic drugs, like chlorpromazine, may treat the symptoms of such disorders. Lobotomies are not common today.\nSocial context.\nOne question is why was such a dramatic surgical technique so widely accepted. It is generally agreed that psychiatrists wanted to find some way of helping thousands of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the twentieth century. Also, those same patients had little power to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors.\nIndications and outcomes.\nAccording to the \"Psychiatric Dictionary\" in 1970:\nGood results are obtained in about 40 percent of cases, fair results in some 35 percent and poor results in 25 percent. The mortality rate probably does not exceed 3 percent. Greatest improvement is seen in patients whose premorbid personalities were 'normal', cyclothymic, or obsessive compulsive; in patients with superior intelligence and good education; in psychoses with sudden onset and a clinical picture of affective symptoms of depression or anxiety, and with behaviouristic changes such as refusal of food, overactivity, and delusional ideas of a paranoid nature. \nAccording to the same source, prefrontal lobotomy reduces:\nanxiety feelings and introspective activities; and feelings of inadequacy and self-consciousness are thereby lessened. Lobotomy reduces the emotional tension associated with hallucinations and does away with the catatonic state. Because nearly all psychosurgical procedures have undesirable side effects, they are ordinarily resorted to only after all other methods have failed. The less disorganized the personality of the patient, the more obvious are post-operative side effects. ... \nConvulsive seizures are reported as [effects] of prefrontal lobotomy in 5 to 10 percent of all cases. Such seizures are ordinarily well controlled with the usual anti-convulsive drugs. Post-operative blunting of the personality, apathy, and irresponsibility are the rule rather than the exception. Other side effects include distractibility, childishness, facetiousness, lack of tact or discipline, and post-operative incontinence."}

It is lifted by heating the air inside the balloon, usually with fire. Hot air weighs less than the same volume of cold air (it is less dense), which means that hot air will rise up or float when there is cold air around it, just like a bubble of air in a pot of water. The greater the difference between the hot and the cold, the greater the difference in density, and the stronger the balloon will pull up. This means that balloons can carry more weight on a cold day, or if the air inside the balloon is very hot. At higher temperature, the air molecules move faster. This causes the molecules to spread out and therefore hot air is less dense than cooler air.\nHistory.\nThe hot air balloon is the oldest form of flying technology that can successfully carry people. The earliest use of hot air to make objects fly was made in Ancient China. Paper lanterns were sent into the air for signalling.\nThe first hot air balloon to carry a person was made by the Montgolfier brothers. On 19 September 1783, they demonstrated their invention for King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette at the French court in Paris. The passengers were a sheep, a duck and a rooster. They flew for 480 metres. The first flight carrying a person was on 15 October 1783. It carried Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier. The balloon was attached to the ground by a rope. The first \"free\" flight, without being attached to the ground, was a few weeks later, on 21 November 1783. It carried Marquis Fran\u00e7ois d'Arlandes and Pilatre de Rozier.\nHow it works.\nThe air is made up of molecules. When the air is cold, these molecules are closer together. When the air is hot, they move away from each other. So, in the same space, there are fewer molecules in hot air. Hot air is therefore lighter than cold air. This makes it rise and carry up the balloon when the air inside it is heated. The air is heated in the balloon with a burner, which uses bursts of fire to keep the air hot. The fire is fuelled by propane.\nThe heated air is kept inside the balloon by its fabric. This is called the \"envelope\". It is usually made of nylon.\nThe passengers and the pilot stand in the basket, which is attached to the balloon by ropes. The basket is usually made of wicker. Baskets can come in many sizes. It can have enough places for up to 36 people. It depends the size of the balloon to carry that much weight.\nFestivals.\nA hot air balloon festival is a type of air show. It is where ballooners display and fly their balloons together. During these events, they fly in the morning and in the evening if the conditions allow it. People can enjoy a balloon flight if they pay. There are many activities. Sometimes, the balloons are lit up against the night sky.\nAt these festivals, people can see different shapes of balloons. Usually, they are kind of round but they may have forms."}

It had, like much of philosophy, a history which went as far back as Aristotle, but it was Locke who made it known to our modern world:\nHumans, when born, are thought not have mental experience or knowledge, and that everything is learned after they grow. In particular, Locke thought all knowledge came from sense data, and the mind is empty at the beginning. By 'sense data' is meant the process of hearing, seeing, touching etc.\nLocke's idea was immediately picked up by others:\nMany have held similar views. The founder of behaviourism, John B. Watson (1878\u20131938):\nThroughout the 20th century the influence of evolution and genetics ran against these liberal ideas. Ethology proved that much animal behaviour was inherited, instinctual, (innate and permanent). Konrad Lorenz argued that the aggression so obvious in the history of mankind was a playing out of behaviour which had evolutionary advantage in our past. The field of evolutionary psychology set out to examine the role played by evolution on our mental life. If humans share a common evolutionary history with the other animals, it is likely that we inherit mental traits from our evolution. The human ability to learn a language is inherited, and is of huge practical importance. Very important also (though less obvious) is the way that our unconscious mind helps us get through life. The apparatus which performs that mental activity is certainly inherited. These are some reasons why a number of recent publications have rejected Locke's idea."}

It is named after Henri Poincar\u00e9, the French mathematician and physicist who formulated it in 1904.\nThe sphere (also called the 2-sphere, as it is a 2-dimensional surface, although it is usually seen as inside a three dimensional space) has the property that any loop on it can be contracted to a point (if a rubber band is wrapped around the sphere, it is possible to slide it down to a point). Mathematicians say that the 2-sphere is simply connected. Other spaces do not have this property, for example the donut: a rubber band that goes around the whole donut once cannot be slid down to a point without it leaving the surface.\nMathematicians knew that this property was unique to the 2-sphere, in the sense that any other simply connected space that does not have edges and is small enough (in mathematician terms, that is compact) is in fact the 2-sphere. It is no longer true if we remove the idea of smallness however, as an infinitely large plane is also simply connected. Also, a regular disk (a circle and its interior) is simply connected, but it has an edge (the bounding circle).\nThe conjecture asks whether the same is true for the 3-sphere, which is an object living naturally in four dimensions. This question motivated much of modern mathematics, especially in the field of topology. The question was finally settled in 2002 by Grigori Perelman, a Russian mathematician, with methods from geometry, showing that it is indeed true. He was awarded a Fields Medal and the $1 million Millennium Prize for his work, both of which he declined.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 conjecture can also be extended to higher dimensions: this is the generalised Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Surprisingly, it was easier to prove the fact for higher-dimensional spheres: In 1960, Smale proved it to be true for the 5-sphere, 6-sphere and higher. In 1982, Freedman proved that it was also true for the 4-sphere, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal."}

Most of the large land animals which were alive 12,000 years ago are now extinct, and there is much discussion as to what has caused this. The two main theories are hunting by humans, and climate change. Together, these reasons are enough to explain why these previously successful animals are now extinct. Elephant birds on Madagascar were certainly hunted to extinction, as were the Moas in New Zealand. Archaeological sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moas became extinct about five hundred years ago. The moas had survived being hunted by Haast's Eagle, but they did not survive being hunted for food by the Maoris.\nFor many others the climate changes may have been the main reason for their extinction."}

Specifically, the Cucurbitaceae are responsible for some food species, such as squash, pumpkin (both from \"Cucurbita\"), watermelon (\"Citrullus vulgaris\"), melon and cucumber (both \"Cucumis\"). The Begoniaceae are known for their horticultural species, of which there are over 130."}

It is like a bicycle, but it has only one wheel. It has a seat and pedals, but no chain or gears. There is no handlebar, it is steered by gripping the seat with the legs and twisting the body. A rider keeps their balance by moving their arms, and controlling their speed. It is usually used for acting and performing. A unicycle is more expensive than a cheap bicycle, because unicycles are far less common.\nThere are two kinds of unicycles; giraffe unicycles and traditional unicycles. Giraffe unicycles are much taller than traditional unicycles, and use a chain so that the performer's legs do not have to stretch very far. Giraffe unicycles are mostly used by performers in circuses. \nUnicycles are often used while the performer is simultaneously juggling or plate spinning. To do this, performers usually rock back and forth on the unicycle. This is called \"idling\". It lets the performer pay attention to what they are doing in their hands, instead of to the ground in front of them. To \"idle\" a unicycle, performers usually press one foot down, anchoring it in the bottom position of the wheel. This foot both provides support and completes the rocking motion that is necessary to keep the unicycle balanced.\nMany other tricks can be done when riding a unicycle. This includes going backwards, riding up and down steps, pedaling with only one foot, hopping in place, wheel-walking (putting the feet on the tire instead of on the pedals) and riding over obstacles."}

It is a deep-level underground metro line that runs from Brixton in south London to Walthamstow Central in the north-east. It started running in 1968. On the Tube map it is shown with a light blue color. It is the fourth busiest line on the London Underground network. It is the only line on the Underground, other than the two-stop Waterloo &amp; City line, which is completely underground. The only section of track to come above ground is the route to the depot from Seven Sisters to Northumberland Park.\nThe Underground line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations. The stations are on top of small hills, or humps. As the train travels up the hill to the station its weight helps it to slow down. As the train leaves the station it travels down the hill, with gravity helping the train to speed up. This saves 5% energy and makes the trains run 9% faster. Each new platform built for the Victoria Line is 132.6 metres long. Around 200 million people use the Victoria line each year.\nHistory.\nA new tube railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948. The main purpose of the line was to relieve congestion in the central area. The Private Bill needed to build it was introduced into Parliament in 1955. The Bill described a line from Victoria to Walthamstow (Wood Street). There was also a proposal for an extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway station on the District line, but this was not included in the Bill.\nThe construction work on the Walthamstow\u2013Victoria section began in 1962. It continued until 1972, when Pimlico station was opened. A test tunnel from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road had been constructed in 1959 and this was later integrated into the running tunnels. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the line during its construction. In July 1968, they visited the tunnels that were being built under Vauxhall Park.\nBarbara Castle, the Minister of Transport gave approval on 4 August 1967 to build the Brixton extension. Preparatory work started at a site on Bessborough Gardens near to Vauxhall Bridge Road in May 1967. On 28 June 1968, Richard Marsh, then Minister of Transport approved the proposal to build a station at Pimlico.\nThe name \"Victoria line\" dates back to 1955. Other suggestions were \"Walvic line\" (Walthamstow Central station\u2013Victoria station) and \"Viking line\" (Victoria station\u2013King's Cross station). During the planning stages, it was known as \"Route C\". Later, it was named the Victoria line after Victoria Station by David McKenna. This suggestion was seconded by Sir John Elliot.\nThe Victoria line was designed to get rid of build-ups of traffic on other lines, such as the Piccadilly line. It was also designed to have as many interchanges as possible, and all stations except Pimlico have an interchange with at least one other London Underground or National Rail line. It had been intended to build the line past Walthamstow Central to Wood Street (Walthamstow), where it would come above ground to terminate next to the British Railways station. However, a late decision in 1961 saw the line cut back to Walthamstow Central station. Until 1968 this station was called Walthamstow (Hoe Street).\nEach Victoria line station apart from Pimlico was built as an interchange station and several existing stations were re\u2013arranged to allow for cross-platform interchange with it. In some cases this was achieved by placing the Victoria line platforms on either side of the existing station. In others the Victoria line uses one of the older platforms and the existing line was moved toto a new platform.\nAt Euston, northbound Victoria and Northern line (Bank branch) trains run along platforms next to each other, although they are travelling in opposite directions. \"Same-direction\" cross-platform interchanges are available at Stockwell (with the Northern line), Oxford Circus (with the Bakerloo line), Highbury &amp; Islington (with First Capital Connect, originally the Northern City Line) and at Finsbury Park (with the Piccadilly line).\nAll Victoria line stations were originally tiled in a light blue colour. Each station was decorated with tiled motifs on seating recesses to differentiate them from each other. During the construction of the Jubilee line in the late 1970s, the original motifs on Green Park station were replaced by motifs matching the new design for the Jubilee line platforms.\nPlatform humps were installed on all Victoria Line stations, except for Pimlico, during late 2010 and 2011. This was done to provide step-free access to trains. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 created the need for the humps to be installed. The humps are a ramp type, similar to those being installed on some mainline stations. They are of a masonry construction.\nOpening.\nThe first section opened was between Walthamstow Central and Highbury &amp; Islington. There was no opening ceremony for this. The normal timetable started on 1 September 1968. The first train left Walthamstow Central for Highbury &amp; Islington at about 7:32 am. Later that year, the section between Highbury &amp; Islington and Warren Street was opened. Again there was no ceremony.\nThe official opening ceremony for the line took place at Victoria station on 7 March 1969. Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a commemorative plaque on the station concourse. After a short ceremony, she bought a 5d (old pence) ticket and travelled to Green Park. In new pence this would be about 2.08p. This made her the first monarch to ride the Underground.\nPrincess Alexandra opened the Brixton extension on 23 July 1971. She rode the train from Brixton to Vauxhall.\nService and rolling stock.\nTrains run every two minutes during peak periods (when its the busiest). In normal service, all trains run from Brixton to Seven Sisters. About three out of five continue to Walthamstow Central.\nWhen the line first opened it was served by a fleet of 8-car 1967 tube stock trains. Each is made up of two four-car units. Later on, a number of cars of 1972 Mark I tube stock were adapted to work with the 1967 stock. This meant that there were finally 43 trains, each of which was made up of two four-car units. The 1967 tube stock was replaced by 2009 tube stock between 2009 and 2011 (see below).\nAt first, an articulated type of rolling stock was thought about. This idea was not used because it would have been too hard to move the stock to Acton Works for heavy overhauls. This is no longer a problem since train overhauls have been moved away from Acton Works to the builders' own works. The new 2009 tube stock is wider and the carriage is slightly longer. This means it can only run on the Victoria line, as it is too wide for the tunnels of other deep level tube lines.\nThe line has an Automatic Train Operation system (ATO). The train operator (driver) closes the train doors and presses a pair of \"start\" buttons. If the way ahead is clear, the ATO drives the train at a safe speed to the next station and stops there. This system has been in place since the line opened in 1968. This makes the Victoria line the world's first full-scale automatic railway.\nFuture.\nWhen the Victoria line was built, there were severe budget restrictions. As a result, the station infrastructure standards were lower than on older lines and on later extension projects. Examples of these lower standards include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at Walthamstow Central, Blackhorse Road and Tottenham Hale. This also affects lighting levels. At most stations between the up and down escalators there is a concrete staircase where an additional escalator could be installed, but has not been fitted. It can cause severe congestion at peak times. This has been remedied at Brixton in 2004 and at Vauxhall in 2006 where an additional escalator has been installed in place of the fixed stairway.\nIn addition, there have been station closures for safety reasons, when both escalators have been unserviceable. Over many years, heavy equipment has been installed in fenced-off sections at the ends of platforms owing to the lack of anywhere else to install them. It is not clear from Transport for London's Five-Year Investment Programme whether these shortcomings are likely to be remedied.\nThe 1967 stock was replaced bit by bit from July 2009 as part of Transport for London's 5-year \u00a310\u00a0billion redevelopment project. The replacement for the line's 1967 tube stock is the 2009 tube stock built by Bombardier Transportation. The first train was built in 2006. Testing of the new trains began in 2008. The main fleet began to be introduced in 2009 and went into main service in 2010. The last of the 1967 stock trains ran on 30 June 2011, after which the whole service was provided by 2009 stock.\nSupporters of Tottenham Hotspur (and the club itself) have campaigned for a surface station to be opened next to Northumberland Park Station, next to the line's depot. This would provide an improvement in transport links, seen as essential if the club's wish to redevelop their ground and increase crowd capacity is to become a reality. The idea was looked into but Network Rail own the necessary land and need it for their own expansion plans.\nWhen Crossrail 2 is built, it will lower the number of passengers on the Victoria line (there are too many at the moment). It will offer an alternative route across Central London between Victoria and King's Cross St. Pancras.\nFor many years there have been proposals to extend southwards from Brixton one stop to Herne Hill. Herne Hill is a railway station that can link passengers to Kent and other places. The tube station would be on a large reversing loop with one platform. This would remove a problem of having too many trains by getting rid if the need for trains to reverse at Brixton. However, this would cost too much money for how little it would actually help passengers. Given that the line is very overcrowded, this is the only extension that could ever happen.\nDepot.\nNorthumberland Park Depot is the service and storage area for trains on the Victoria Line. It is the only part of the line not in tunnel. It is next to Northumberland Park railway station, on Tottenham Marshes, Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey.\nThe Depot is connected to the Victoria Line by a tunnelled branch line to a junction to the north of Seven Sisters. It was opened with the first stage of the line in 1968.\nThere is a local campaign for platforms for the Victoria Line to be built at Northumberland Park station. This is supported by the Haringey Council and by Tottenham Hotspur F.C. because the club thinks the new platforms are necessary for their plans to increase capacity at their White Hart Lane ground."}

They are often used on subways and local train services. Before third rails, electricity was carried in overhead wires.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century engineers found ways to use electricity to power trains. Scottish engineer Robert Davidson designed and built an electric locomotive in 1837 using batteries. Locomotives powered by batteries could not be used on the main railways due to the frequent need to charge them. \nGerman engineer Werner von Siemens in 1879 designed the first reliable electric locomotive to carry passengers. Siemens' design used a 2.2kW electric motor and had a top speed of just over 13km/h. This new locomotive hauled three passenger cars along a 300 meter circular railway track and carried about 90,000 people in four months during its trail run at the Berlin Industrial Exhibition. Siemens' electric locomotive was the first train to use a third rail and power was provided by a dynamo built for this purpose. \nEarly electric trains were unable to access a widely available and reliable source of electricity. A network of electricity that went wherever the rail line network went was needed. Whilst many modern long distance trains use an overhead wire system to provide power, the third rail was the first successful means of supplying power. It remains very much in use world-wide today, especially in local and rapid transit systems.\nTechnical aspects.\nThe third rail is usually located outside the two running rails, but occasionally between them. The electricity is transmitted to the train by means of a sliding shoe, which is held in contact with the rail. On many systems an insulating cover is provided above the third rail to protect employees working near the track; sometimes the shoe is designed to contact the side (called side running) or bottom (called bottom running) of the third rail, allowing the protective cover to be mounted directly to its top surface. When the shoe slides on top, it is referred to as top running. When the shoe slides on the bottom it is not affected by the build-up of snow or leaves.\nDanger.\nThird rails typically carry hundreds of volts in high amperage current. This makes them very dangerous. In 2005 American James Maki fell onto the third rail at a Boston rail station and suffered extensive and disfiguring injuries. As part of his treatment he became the second American recipient of a face transplant. Many deaths occur around the world each year due to human contact with a third rail. In New York City, there have been multiple cases of people dying because they have urinated on the third rail."}

It was the site of Canada's first subway line.\nYonge Street is the home of or close to many places of interest in Toronto, including street and theatre acts, the Eaton Centre, the Hockey Hall of Fame and\u2013at the very start of the road\u2013'One Yonge Street', the offices of the \"Toronto Star\" newspaper. The Yonge Line of the Toronto subway under or along it from south of King Street to Finch Avenue. The Viva Blue BRT line goes along Yonge from Finch to Newmarket Bus Terminal.\nCultural significance.\nYonge Street is thought to be Toronto's main street, because of it splits the city into east and west, and the has the Yonge subway line running under it. It is also the main place people come to celebrate events.\nParts of the street are often closed for events, such as an yearly street party. Toronto's annual Gay Pride, Orange Order, and Santa Claus parades also use Yonge Street for a large part of their routes. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot has a song about Yonge Street, titled \"On Yonge Street\", on his album \"A Painter Passing Through\".\n2018 van incident.\nOn April 23, 2018 a white van collided with numerous pedestrians killing nine and injuring sixteen others at Yonge Street."}

About half are photosynthetic, the rest are mostly heterotroph predators of other protists. The ones which are photosynthetic are sometimes loosely called 'algae'; the one which are predators are sometimes loosely called 'protozoa'. \nThey have been classified as an order, a class and a phylum by different authors. Active research is being done on their relationships.\nMost are marine plankton, but they are common in fresh water habitats as well. Their populations are distributed depending on temperature, salinity, or depth. The group includes many symbionts and bioluminescent species.\nAbout 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently described. The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater and parasitic dinoflagellates.\nBiology.\nZooxanthellae.\nSome dinoflagellates are zooxanthellae: endosymbionts of marine eukaryotes, and animals such as anthozoan corals. These reef-building corals largely depend on them. Other organisms which can host zooxanthellae include jellyfish, clams, foraminifera, sea slugs i.e. nudibranchs, and also ciliates and radiolaria.\nRed tides.\nDinoflagellates are responsible for the 'red tides' which may poison fish. They sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre. Some species produce neurotoxins, which in such quantities kill fish and accumulate in filter feeders such as shellfish, which in turn may pass them on to people who eat them. This phenomenon is called a red tide, from the color the bloom imparts to the water. Not all dinoflagellate blooms are dangerous. Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of bioluminescent dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed.\nClassification.\nAlthough classified as eukaryotes, the dinoflagellate nuclei lack some key features of eukaryotic nuclei. In fact, Dodge termed the dinoflagellate nucleus as \"mesokaryotic\", due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus. This group, however, does contain typically eukaryotic organelles, such as golgi complexes, mitochondria and chloroplasts.\nThe group contains many complex organelles and life styles. Some have structures rather like vertebrates eyes; some have nematocysts; some live as plasmodia (multinucleate forms); some have two flagella; photosynthetic dinoflagellates contain a \"bewildering array\" of plastid types; and the whole of their genetics and cell biology is eccentric.\nFossils.\nFossil dinoflagellates are important in \"stratigraphy\", the dating and correlation of strata. During their life, dinoflagellates have a mobile planktonic form and a resistant cyst phase which enables them to survive over winter in sediment. Only the cyst gets fossilised. Their first certain appearance is in the Silurian period, with a big radiation in the Mesozoic era.p440 They are classified as \"Phylum Dinomastigota\" by Margulis and colleagues."}

The term is also be used for bacteria, fungi, lichens and mosses which grow on plants. However, most epiphytes (89%) are flowering plants; and about a third of all ferns are epiphytes. \nAn epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it. The ones in the temperate zone are often mosses, liverworts, lichens and algae, and in the tropics ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads.\nSometimes such plants are called air plants, because they do not root in soil. This is misleading though, as there are many aquatic epiphytes as well. Epiphytic organisms only take support from the host; they are usually not parasites. Parasitic and semi-parasitic plants, like the mistletoe are not true epiphytes.\nEpiphytes usually use photosynthesis to get energy; often they have adapted their leaves to be able to capture rainwater (and moisture from the air) if they are not aquatic.\nEpiphytes are important for other species too, certain frogs live in the water reservoir of epiphytes."}

This is an order of aquatic birds, the loons or divers and their closest extinct relatives.\nLoons are the size of a large duck or a small goose. Loons can be hard to find because they are shy around people. The name \"loon\" is from the Scandinavian word for \"clumsy\". Loons are the state bird of Minnesota. Loons are found in most parts of North America (there are five North American species) and northern Eurasia. They enjoy cool climates in the summer and migrate to ocean coasts in the winter.\nLoons can dive up to 200 feet underwater for food. Their bodies are shaped for diving. To dive better, they have solid bones (most birds' bones are hollow) and feet placed far back for swimming under the water. They have black (or grey)-and-white heads, pale breasts, and striped back feathers. \nLoons can lay up to two eggs. The females are brownish in color which helps them blend into their surroundings. Both the male and female parent take turns sitting on the eggs. After hatching, they fly south when the weather gets cool. The young loons spend three years in the south before returning to the north.\nThey are best known for their loud, trumpeting call. They also make melodic, wailing or laughing sounds. Loons communicate to each other through their sounds. They also communicate with humans and other animals through dance. Loons warn others to stay away from their nests by dancing on the water. Loons are protective parents and will dance to exhaustion and death to protect their eggs. Raccoons, gulls, and skunks have been known to devour loon eggs. \nLoons eat fish like sunfish, perch, and bullheads. Loons do not chew their food. They have elastic throats that allow the loon to swallow their food whole. When they swallow fish, their throat expands to the size of the fish they eat so they do not choke. \nScientists band, or tag loons to try to understand more about them. Their life style is similar to the grebes, but they are a different group of birds."}

The crossbow was first created by the Chinese people in circa 6 B.C. The Greeks invented crossbow separately in 4th century B.C. The Romans called the weapon \"arcuballista\". Crossbow was a very popular weapon in the Middle Ages as it was strong and accurate and could be used as a sharpshooter weapon. The Arabs call crossbow \"qaws Ferengi\", \"Frankish bow\", as the Crusaders used crossbow a lot. A good crossbow can shoot the bolt with such immense power that it may pierce armour. Against unarmoured light opponents, even a single bolt may be lethal.\nCompared to the ordinary bow, the crossbows have good and bad sides to them. They fire much stronger and much more accurately than ordinary bows, and shooting accurately with a crossbow is easier to learn than shooting with an ordinary bow. On the other hand, because the prod is short and therefore very stiff, a crossbow will take much longer time to load, and a crossbow does not have as good accurate range than a longbow. Many crossbows have crank or windlass mechanisms to pull the string in drawn position. Also many crossbows do have safety mechanisms to prevent an accidental shot.\nCrossbow shooting is today a popular sport."}

If someone with coeliac disease eats something with gluten (for example, wheat, rye, barley), cells inside the body attack the lining of the intestine. This means that they cannot digest (eat) food properly, making them unable to have enough energy, vitamins, or minerals. Children may be unable to grow taller or gain weight properly. People with coeliac disease often lose weight. They are also frequently tired.\nOverview.\nPeople with coeliac disease often have bloating and pain in their abdominal (stomach) area, diarrhoea (watery stools) or steatorrhea (fat in their stools). These symptoms can lead to flatulence. Their stomachs also start to hurt and they might suffer from joint pains, seizures, rashes, fatigue, slowness in growth and puberty, loss in weight, loss of bone density and fertility issues.\nTo relieve the effects of coeliac disease, one must stop eating gluten. There are no medicines or cure that can stop Coeliac disease. To get fully better, it usually takes about two years of not eating gluten, during which time the previously damaged intestine might recover. They must remain on a gluten-free diet for the rest of their life in order to treat this condition.\nCoeliac disease is genetic and relatives (such a children, siblings, parents) with this disease have a 1 in 10 chance of developing Coeliac disease. This means that the person affected by it is born with genes that cause the immune system to react poorly to gluten. However, Coeliac disease is not always present during childhood. It can be triggered as an adult by an event such as pregnancy (hormone shifts) or illness.\nTo find out if a person has Coeliac disease, doctors look in the blood to see if they have the cells that attack the intestine when gluten is eaten. The protein that attacks the intestine is called an antibody. Antibodies are produced by white blood cells, and they normally stop illnesses from growing in the body, but in the case of coeliac disease, one of the antibodies thinks that gluten is something that will cause illness. Doctors can also look into the patient's intestines with a camera on a tube called an endoscope. This can show if the intestines are being or have been damaged, because of coeliac disease."}

The best-known thing this causes is making the north star's place in the sky slowly change over thousands of years. It is caused by the Sun's gravity pulling the Earth's poles toward itself. Because the Earth's poles are tilted at an angle of 23.42 degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit, this causes the North Pole to seem to point at different places in the sky. While the orientation of the Earth with respect to the stars changes, the axial tilt remains constant. \nAlthough it takes a very long time for the pole to make a whole circle in the sky (almost 26,000 years), even over the time period that humans have had writing, this has made a big difference in what star is seen as the north star. When the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids about 4,000 years ago, they used the stars to make the edges line up with north and south. However, they did not use the same north star that we do because Earth's North Pole pointed at a different star than it does today. \nAstronomers have known about this movement for a very long time, calling it the precession of the equinoxes. Most people think that Hipparchus discovered it in ancient Greece in about 130 BC, but some people think that even the ancient Egyptians may have known about it."}

It is run by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Since the first part under Yonge Street opened in 1954 with 12 stations, the system has grown to be Canada's biggest rapid transit rail system. It has four lines and 69 stations on 68.3\u00a0km of track. The subway system is used very often and has the most number of passengers of any system in Canada. It has an average of 948,100 passenger trips each weekday (as of 2010).\nThe system is was made bigger on the western part of the Yonge\u2013University Line with new tracks and stations being made north to York University, Steeles Avenue, and Vaughan Corporate Centre in York Region. The Government of Ontario said on March 23, 2006 that it will give $670 million for this new work, which is less than one-third of the total money needed. The new track is about 8.6\u00a0km long and was built with six new stations: Downsview Park, Finch West, York University, Pioneer Village, Highway 407, and the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre. It was expected to cost about $2 billion.\nHistory.\nThe first part of the subway, replaced a very busy streetcar route, and followed Yonge Street from Eglinton Avenue south to Front Street, then turned west for one block to end at Bay Street, next to the city's main railway station Union Station and so the subway station was also called Union. This line was finished in 1954 and was 7.4\u00a0km long.\nIn 1963 another part was added, that went north from Union station, below University Avenue and Queen's Park to near Bloor Street, where it turned west to end at St. George and Bloor Streets.\nThe Bloor-Danforth Line opened up in 1966 along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue from Keele Street to Woodbine Avenue, and was made longer in 1968 to run from Islington Avenue to Warden station at Warden and St. Clair Avenues. \nThe routing of the line across the Don Valley was possible because of a choice made more than forty years before. When the Prince Edward Viaduct was built across the Don River in 1919, its design included twin decks below the road to allow for future rail lines. This made it possible for the subway to cross the Don Valley to Danforth Avenue on the east side.\nThe Yonge-University line was extended north 8.7\u00a0km from Eglinton Avenue to Finch Avenue and Yonge in 1973 and 1974.\nMore track (9.9\u00a0km) was added to the Yonge-University Line in 1978 when it was extended from St. George and Bloor, north and northwest to Eglinton Avenue and Allen Road, then north along the middle of Allen Road to Wilson Avenue. \nIn October 1976, an arson (a fire set on purpose) destroyed subway cars and damage to Christie station. This caused the closure of the Bloor-Danforth Line for three days, and closed Christie station for some time for repairs. More track was added in 1980 at both ends of the Bloor-Danforth Line. These extensions each added one station, bus bays, and, on the eastern end, room to to the Scarborough RT.\nWith six stations on 6.8\u00a0km of track, the Scarborough RT is a line built almost all above the ground, and which has no direct tracks that connect to the other lines and uses a different trains. It uses the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) trains which are very different from subway trains. The route is fully separate from road traffic and pedestrians, the stations are fully covered, and the trains have many doors that use high platforms. \nAn extra 1.6\u00a0km was added to the north end of the Spadina part of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line, adding one station (Downsview), with parking for buses. \nIn August 1995, the TTC had a really bad subway accident in what it calls the Russell Hill accident, on the Yonge-University-Spadina Line south of St. Clair West station. Three women died and 100 people were injured, a few badly. \nThe subway's newest line, Sheppard, opened in 2002. It runs 5.5\u00a0km east, under Sheppard Avenue from Sheppard station on the Yonge line (now called Sheppard-Yonge), to Don Mills station at Sheppard and Don Mills Road. The Sheppard line has less users than the other two subway lines, and shorter trains run on it.\nIn its over fifty-year history, the first baby to be born on a TTC subway station platform only occurred recently on February 6, 2006. This incident occurred at Wellesley station and caused delays on the subway system. It was front-page news for many days.\nAn automatic voice system was added to each station (such as; \"The next station is Bloor, Bloor station.\") which ended the need for the train operator to announce each stop. The automated system is used in the whole subway and RT system.\nPlans for the future.\nUntil recently, the TTC did not have plans to expand the subway during the last twenty years but only had plans to build new above-ground rapid transit lines based upon streetcars travelling in closed lanes on streets. Today there are plans to build new subway lines under the ground, including extensions to the Spadina-University line and two lines in the central section of the city south of Bloor-Danforth.\nOperations and procedures.\nLike most subways, the Toronto subway/RT trains get electricity from a third rail that runs next to the tracks. 'Shoes' (pieces of metal that touch the third-rail) mounted on both sides of each coach for contact. Power is supplied at 600 V DC.\nA train guard opens and closes the subway car doors, and makes sure no one is trapped in a door as the train leaves a station. The train guard tells the driver when it is okay to leave. The car carrying the guard can be identified by the white or the orange light outside the subway car. \nHours and frequency of operation.\nOn weekdays and Saturday, subway service runs from approximately 6:00\u00a0am to 1:30\u00a0am, but Sunday service begins at 9:00\u00a0am. Start times on holidays may vary.\nStations.\n\"For complete lists and details of stations, lines, and their locations in the Toronto subway/RT system, see List of Toronto subway and RT stations.\"\nCurrent stations.\nMost stations are named for the nearby road crossed by the line in question. A few are named for major landmarks, such as shopping centres or other transportation stations near the station. \nAll trains stop at every station along their route and run the entire length of their line from end to end."}

It is a natural substance, oozing out of the ground in places like the La Brea tar pits. Usually it is made by heating coal inside a chemical apparatus.\nMost tar is produced from coal as a byproduct of coke production, but it can also be produced from petroleum, peat or wood. The \"destructive distillation\" of a ton of coal can produce 700 kg of coke, 100 litres of liquor ammonia, 50 litres of coal tar and 400 m3 of coal gas.\nIt used to be one of the products of gasworks. Tar made from coal or petroleum is considered toxic. It causes cancer because of its high benzene content. In low concentrations, however, tar is used as a medicine on the skin. \nTar kilns are dry distillation ovens, used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole, to allow the tar to come out. The wood is split to dimensions of a finger and stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss to stop air entering. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out, and continues to do so for a few days.\nUses.\nTar is used in treatment of the skin disease psoriasis, where coal tar is the most effective. Tar is a general disinfectant. Petroleum tar was also used in ancient Egyptian mummification circa 1000 BC.\nTar was a vital component of the first sealed, or \"tarmac\", roads. The streets of Baghdad were the first to be paved with tar from the 8th century AD. It was also used as seal for roofing shingles and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia wood tar was used to waterproof sails and boats, but today sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have negated the need for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well painting exterior walls of log buildings. \nMixing tar with linseed oil varnish produces tar paint. Tar paint can be used to protect wood from weather. Tar paint can also be toned with various pigments, producing translucent colours and preserving the wood texture. "}

In a simple example, water has a low viscosity, as it is \"thin\". Syrup and tar, on the other hand, have a high viscosity, as they are \"thick\". A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, and water would be much quicker.\nThere are two types of viscosity: \"dynamic viscosity\", measured in pascal seconds, and \"kinematic viscosity\", measured in metres per second squared.\nViscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt. When the lava comes out very thickly (viscous), there is more chance that it will erupt violently. This is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can. If the lava is thin (low viscosity), then it just flows out like water.\nThe word \"viscous\" comes from the Latin root \"viscum\", meaning sticky."}

It is the opposite of a face, which is the word for a \"good guy\".\nThe job of the heel is to be booed by the audience (this is called getting heat), which helps to gain sympathy for the face. This can be done in many ways. One common way is to break the rules when the referee is not looking. Another way is to act in a nasty way towards the audience. \nSometimes in American professional wrestling, a person from a foreign country will play the role of a heel who hates America. The Iron Sheik, who is Iranian, is one example. He had a rivalry with Hulk Hogan, who is American and acted as a patriot as one part of his character. It is not necessary for the foreign heel to really be from a foreign country. For example, Fritz Von Erich played the role of an evil German, despite really being from Texas.\nWWE has said that it has stopped making it clear whether a wrestler is a face or a heel. This is partly because audiences know professional wrestling is scripted. Because of this, they might cheer a heel who puts on good matches. Also, they may boo a face who they think is being featured too much and is not skilled enough for it, and so any heel facing them in a match would be cheered.\nIn lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling), heels are called \"rudos\". \"Rudos\" tend to use moves that show off their strength and power. This contrasts with \"t\u00e9cnicos\" (faces or good guys), who use a fast-paced style and high-flying moves."}

It was started in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario by Canadian hockey player Tim Horton. In 1967 Tim Horton joined with investor Ron Joyce, who quickly took over running the company and expanded the chain into a multi-million dollar franchise.\nTim Hortons stores quickly spread and together with Subway, became bigger than McDonald's and is now Canada's largest chain of fast food restaurants. The company opened twice as many Canadian stores as did McDonald's and sales also are bigger than those of McDonald's Canadian restaurants as of 2002. The chain got 22.6% of all fast food industry revenues in Canada in 2005. Tim Hortons also has 76% of the Canadian market for baked goods (based on the number of customers) and has 62% of the Canadian coffee market (compared to Starbucks, who is the second largest with 7%). Tim Hortons had 2,733 restaurants in Canada as of July 1, 2007.\nTim Hortons also has international restaurants with 500 in the United States as of December 2008, with one opened in Detroit and owned by former NBA player Derrick Coleman and one on a Canadian military base outside Kandahar, Afghanistan. Tim Hortons' other international efforts include a small outlet at the Dublin Zoo. Tim Hortons also made a deal with the SPAR store chain in the UK and Ireland, with Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts being sold at small self service counters in 16 SPAR stores.\nHistory.\nTim Horton and Ron Joyce.\nThe company's first store opened in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario under the name \"Tim Horton Donuts\" (the word donut would later be dropped and the company name ended up as just \"Tim Horton's\", and later was changed to \"Tim Hortons\" without the apostrophe). The business was started by Tim Horton, who played in the National Hockey League from 1949 until his death in a car accident in 1974.\nSoon after Horton opened the store, he met Ron Joyce, a former Hamilton police constable. In 1965, Joyce took over the Tim Horton Donut Shop on Ottawa Street North in Hamilton. By 1967, after he had opened up two more stores, he and Tim Horton became full partners in the business. After Horton's death in 1974, Joyce bought the company from the Horton family and took over as the only owner of the now forty stores. Joyce expanded the chain quickly in geography and in product selection, opening the 500th store in Aylmer, Quebec, in 1991.\nRon Joyce's very fast expansion of the Tim Hortons business brought about two major changes in the coffee and doughnut restaurant market: independent doughnut shops in Canada were almost wiped out, and Canada's per person ratio of doughnut shops rose past those of all other countries.\nBy the 1990s, the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd but the name of the restaurants are still called Tim Hortons. This was because the company wanted to also go into other types of business, and not just be seen as a doughnut company. In March 2006, shares of the company were first sold to the public.\nExpansion and takeover.\nTDL Group had $1.48 billion in sales in 2005 and has expanded across Canada and also in New York, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Maine.\nIn August 2014, the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital announced it was going to buy out the TDL Group and merge operations of Tim Hortons with that of Burger King. This was done to make it easier to make Tim Hortons a world-wide chain, just like how Burger King is. The purchase was completed in December of that year, and since then, both Tim Hortons and Burger King are part of Restaurant Brands International, which is owned mostly by 3G Capital, but also by the previous shareholders of the two chains under the ticker . But in 2018, it was reported that Tim Hortons franchisees were complaining to the Government of Canada that Restaurant Brands International did not follow the rules that were made in order for the takeover to happen.\nTim Hortons and the Canadian military.\nTim Hortons has many stores on or near many Canadian Forces Bases. TDL Group said in March 2006, that because they were asked by Chief of the Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier, it would open a store at the Canadian Forces operations base in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The new Kandahar store opened on June 29 2006, in a 40\u00a0ft trailer on the military base.\nMenu.\nTim Hortons' first stores only sold two products - coffee and doughnuts. As well as its coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and doughnuts, the Tim Hortons menu now includes a number of other baked goods, such as Timbits (small balls of doughnut dough), muffins, croissants, tea biscuits, cookies, rolls, danishes, and bagels (Tim Hortons now sells one out of every two bagels in the whole Canadian food industry). Cakes to take home are offered in some locations.\nSince the mid-1990s, the chain has moved into other areas, such as flavoured cappuccino, iced cappuccino, iced coffee, New York-style cheesecake, and lunch items such as soup, chili, and submarine sandwiches. In fall 2006, Tim Hortons began selling a breakfast sandwich. This is made of an egg patty, processed cheese slice, either bacon or sausage, and either a biscuit or bagel, it has sold well. In October 2007 Tim Hortons began to sell a Chicken Fajita Wrap, which has spiced chicken and saut\u00e9ed vegetables. In December 2007, they began to sell Hash Browns and the Bagel B.E.L.T., (a breakfast sandwich that has lettuce and tomato.\nAlong with the expansion of stores and the expanded menu came the outsourcing of baked goods. Doughnuts, which used to be made at night so that they were ready for the next morning, are now fully cooked and then frozen and sent to every restaurant from Windsor Ontario. The restaurants now bake them during the day.\nThe company used to sell Coca-Cola products but Tim Hortons switched over to Pepsi in 2007.\nCriticism.\nThrow away cups made by the company are one of the most common litter items in Canada. Company spokespersons claim that customers are the problem, not Tim Hortons.\nIn May 2008, the chain came under fire after an employee in London, Ontario was fired for giving away a single $0.16 Timbit to a baby. A manager was blamed for the . The employee was hired at a different nearby location."}

These pieces are sometimes used to cool drinks. Ice cubes are used in mixed drinks, when the drink has the words \"on the rocks.\"\nIce cubes are made by filling a tray with water and putting it in a freezer. Many freezers also have an icemaker. Icemakers make ice cubes and put them in a bin. After that, they can be put in a glass.\nIce cubes are also made commercially and sold in large amounts. These ice cubes are usually cylindrical, and might have holes through the center. Commercially made ice cubes are very clear, as the water doesn't have much air dissolved in it.\nIce cubes can also be crushed into different-shaped flakes, which some people think makes some kinds of cocktails look better. Crushed ice is also used to cool a drink or other liquid quickly because the speed of cooling depends on the amount and average radius of the ice particles.\nFirst artificial ice cubes.\nAmerican physician and humanitarian John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 to be able to cool air. His refrigerator made ice, which he hung from the ceiling in a basin. Gorrie is the creator of ice cubes, even though he was not trying to cool drinks. Instead, he used the ice to cool the room's temperature. During that time, people thought that bad air quality made people sick. So, to help treat sickness, he advocated for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms.\nIce cube tray.\nIce cube trays are designed to be filled with water, then put in a freezer until the water freezes to ice, thus creating ice cubes. Trays are often flexible, so the ice cubes can be removed easily by flexing the tray. Another design is an aluminum tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes up, releasing them from the tray. A motorized kind of this is in most automatic ice-making freezers.\nEven though ice cubes are usually shaped like cubes, there are trays that make spherical or cylindrical shapes. These are sometimes called ice tubes. Some novelty trays make blocks of ice in seasonal, festive, or other shapes.\nThe first flexible, stainless steel, all-metal ice cube tray was made by Guy L. Tinkham in 1933. The tray bent sideways to remove the ice cubes.\nThe first rubber ice cube tray was made by Lloyd Groff Copeman. One day in 1928, while walking through some woods getting sap for maple syrup, Copeman saw that slush and ice came off of his rubber boots instead of sticking to them. After talking about it with his patent attorney at lunch, he did experiments using rubber cups. Later, he made and patented several kinds of tray: a metal tray with rubber separators, a metal tray with individual rubber cups, and a tray made of only rubber."}

{"id": "169900", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169900", "title": "Mutual information", "text": "Mutual information measures how much more is known about one random value when given another. For example, knowing the temperature of a random day of the year will not reveal what month it is, but it will give some \"hint\". In the same way, knowing what month it is will not reveal the exact temperature, but will make certain temperatures \"more or less likely\". These \"hints\" or \"changes in likelihood\" are explained and measured with mutual information.\nCalculating mutual information.\nRequired information.\nTo calculate mutual information, the probability (chance) of all possible events, and the probability of them happening at the same time, is needed. For example, to measure mutual information between month and temperature we would need to know how many days in the year are 10 degrees Celsius, how many days out of the year are March and finally how many days are 10 degrees Celsius in March.\nFormula.\nThe formula requires the summation, or adding up, of many terms or numbers. Every possible outcome has its own term. From the above calculation of mutual information between month and temperature, we will use the following variables:\nThis means m(3) equals the probability of a randomly selected day being in March. This is 31/365, or about 0.085, since 31 out of 365 days in the year are in March.\nOne term would be as follows:\nIn this formula, \"log\" means logarithm.\nAdding all possible terms together gives the value for mutual information.\nUnderstanding mutual information.\nPossible values.\nThe larger the mutual information, the more you would learn about one random value (e.g. month) when told another (e.g. temperature).\nImportant facts.\nMutual information does not change based on which of the two random values is revealed. This means we know just as much about \"temperature when told the month\" as we know about \"the month when told the temperature\".\nMutual information is difficult to compare. If we calculate mutual information for weather and another value for a card game, the two values cannot easily be compared."}

Sometimes, it comes as close as 6.4\u00a0Gm (16 lunar distances and 4 million miles), as it did on June 14, 1968. The last close approach was in 1996, at 15.1\u00a0Gm, about 40 times as far as the Moon. The most recent close approach was on June 16, 2015, 8.1 Gm (5 million miles).\nIn 1967, Paul Sandorff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gave his students the task of making a plan to destroy Icarus, if it was going to hit the Earth. This plan is known as Project Icarus (which was the basis for the 1979 science fiction film Meteor, starring Sean Connery)."}

They are used for dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as asteroids, but not comets. They are given to a body once its orbit is secured, and are unrelated to provisional designations, which are given when an object is found. \nThe two parts of a formal designation are \nIt looks like this: codice_1, for example (90377) Sedna or . The brackets are now often removed, as in 90377 Sedna, according to what the astronomer wants. In practice, however, for any reasonably well-known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry, and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation: Sedna, .\nThe rule for moons of minor planets, such as the formal designation (87) Sylvia I Romulus for the asteroid moon Romulus, is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used, on and off, for the moons of the planets since Galileo's time. \nComets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center, but use a different cataloguing system.\nHistory.\nBy 1851, there were 15 asteroids, all but one with their own symbol. The symbols were becoming less and less simple, and, as they had to be drawn by hand, astronomers found some of them hard to draw. This difficulty was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould in 1851, who suggested numbering asteroids in the order that they were found, and placing this number in a circle as the symbol for the asteroid, such as \u2463 for the fourth asteroid, Vesta. This practice was soon coupled with the name itself into an official number-name designation, \"\u2463 Vesta\", as the number of minor planets increased. By \"ca\" 1858, the circle had been simplified to brackets, \"(4)\" and \"(4) Vesta\", which was easier to typeset. Other punctuation such as \"4) Vesta\" and \"4, Vesta\" was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.\nThe major exception to the convention that the number tracks the order they were or the order that they're orbit was calculated is the case of Pluto. Since Pluto was originally called a planet, it was not given a number until a 2006 redefinition of \"planet\" that didn't include it. At that point, Pluto was given the formal designation (134340) Pluto."}

The most common type is the equestrian saddle made for a horse. Saddles have been made for camels and other animals. The earliest saddles were simple pads fixed with a surcingle seen by 800 BC, with the saddle tree coming into use about 200 BC, and paired stirrups by 322 AD Saddles in use today, date back to the 1700s. Today, modern saddles come in different styles, designed for different equestrian activities. They need careful fit for both the rider and the horse. Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for many years.\nThe two most common saddle types used for horse riding are the English saddle and the Western saddle. The English saddle is used for horse sports like show jumping, dressage, and eventing. It is also used for horse showing. It has less leather and is lighter than most Western saddles. \nThe Western saddle is used for horse activities where the rider needs more support than in and english saddle. It is also used for showing, barrel racing, rodeo, and many other sports. The biggest difference is it has a horn on the front, and a higher cantle. This was used originally for tying cattle off when working, so the ranchers could brand or work with the cow. It's now used more widely, in barrel racing it's used for support, in roping events, it's still used to tie cattle. \nThe there are many different types of English and Western saddles. All are designed for a specific purpose. So while they might look different, they all help the rider for the sport or activity for which they were designed. For example, a rider would not want to jump in a Western saddle because the horn would make it hard for them to stay in the correct position over the jump. A rider would not want to work cows in a jumping saddle because they would not have a horn and because the Western saddle puts the rider in a better position for working cows."}

The bridle is the headgear that holds a bit which goes in the mouth of a horse, and also the reins that are joined to the bit.\nBridles are usually made of leather. They are made of different parts which are buckled together. The headpiece, also called a crownpiece, goes behind the horse's ears. The browband is placed across the horse's forehead. The throatlach goes behind the horse's cheek. The cheekpieces extend across the horse's cheek and attach to the bit. The noseband goes across the horse's nose and under its chin. Some bridles do not have a noseband. Others have special nosebands designed to prevent the horse from opening its mouth too widely and crossing its jaw. Sometimes, a strap called a martingale is attached to the noseband.\nA bridle without a bit uses a noseband to control a horse, and is called a hackamore, or a bitless bridle. Bitless bridles work by pressure and leverage on the horse's nose and chin groove. Bitless bridles can be useful for horses that have problems with their mouths. It is more difficult to turn a horse using a bitless bridle, and bitless bridles can provide tremendous leverage and stopping power."}

It can also contain oils of lavender, rosemary, thyme, petitgrain (orange leaf), and jasmine.\nHistory.\n\"Eau de Cologne\" is a spirit-citrus perfume launched in Cologne in 1709 by Giovanni Maria Farina (1685-1766), an Italian perfumer from Santa Maria Maggiore Valle Vigezzo, Italy. In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: \"I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain\" (Eckstein p.8). He named his fragrance \"Eau de Cologne\", in honour of his new hometown. \nThe Original \"Eau de Cologne\" composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to \"nearly all royal houses in Europe\" (Farina Fragrance Museum information leaflet). His ability to produce a constantly homogenous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of \"Eau de Cologne\" prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of \"Eau de Cologne\" and even Farina. \nGiovanni Maria Farina's formula has been produced in Cologne since 1709 by Farina opposite the J\u00fclichplatz and to this day remains a secret. His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the world's oldest fragrance factory. Other Colognes, such as the famous Cologne 4711, named after its location at \"Glockengasse No. 4711\", have the name in common but smell different. In 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a grand-grand-nephew of Giovanni Maria Farina (1685-1766), opened a perfumery business at Paris that developed into Roger &amp; Gallet, that owns the rights to \"Eau de Cologne extra vielle\" in contrast to the Original \"Eau de Cologne\" from Cologne.\n\"Eau de Cologne\", or just \"cologne\", has now become a generic term."}

The result of this is called Pareto efficiency, named after Vilfredo Pareto, who first used it in his studies. \nIn welfare economics, the idea of Pareto efficiency is very simple: If there is no way of improving the situation of one person, without making that of another person worse, the solution found is Pareto-efficient. \nIf we look at what the economy produces, we might say it is on its Pareto Frontier or Production Possibility Frontier, meaning that it is making (or \"producing\") all it can with the things it has (such as machines, labour, land and ideas -- all called resources or factors of production). If this is the case, making more of one thing would mean making less of another; the resources are already being used to full capacity, so making more of one thing will take resources away from making another.\nJust because something is Pareto efficient, it doesn't mean it is fair or \"equitable\". Even though no-one could be made better off without making someone else worse off, it is possible that one person owns all of the world's things. To make anyone else better off, some would have to be taken away from this person, making them worse off."}

He was the second son of a poor fisherman. He worked when he was young because his father died and his mother and older brother were sick. Because of this, he did not learn how to read and write very well.\nLife in the United States.\nIn 1841, when he was fourteen years old, the fishing boat he worked on ran into a storm and was turned over. He and the people with him were on the ocean for five days. They landed on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean where no people lived. They spent 143 days on that island. An American ship passed by the island and John Manjiro and the others were saved.\nAt this time, Japan was a closed country. The American ship or any non-Japanese ship could not enter Japan. Also, any Japanese who left Japan were killed by the Japanese government if they returned to Japan. Most of the people saved from the island were taken to Hawaii. The captain of the ship liked John Manjiro and took Manjiro with him. Manjiro saw a map of the world for the first time and saw how small Japan was in the world. Manjiro was named \u201cJohn Mung\u201d by the captain. He was adopted by the captain of the ship and lived with the captain\u2019s family in the United States. \nManjiro learned English, math, measurement, navigation, and shipbuilding at school. He spent all of his time to studying to be a captain. He learned new ideas from the Western world. For example, democracy and equality between men and women.\nReturn to Japan.\nManjiro returned to Hawaii and bought a boat. He and his friends from the fishing boat started to sail back to Japan in December of 1850. Japan was still a closed country. Because of this, he was investigated by the Shogunate (the rulers of Japan) for a long time. \nIN 1851, Manjiro return to his village in Japan. \nAround this time, Shimazu Nariakira, a historical person in Japan, was interested in English and shipbuilding. John Manjiro began working as an English teacher. He had a strong friendship with many statesmen. He was even asked to be a statesman himself. \nIn 1853-1854, Manjiro was the interpreter for Matthew C. Perry when the Americans first came to Japan. \nIn his later years, Manjiro visited American friends. By then, he could not speak English very well any more. He died in 1898 at the age of 71 years old.\nThe Name, \"John Manjiro\".\nJohn Manjiro was actually born as Manjiro (without a family name). The name \"John\" comes from the name of the ship he was saved by when on the island in 1841. The name of the ship was \"John Howland.\" The captain gave Manjiro this name. In 1938, Ibuse Masuji, a Japanese writer, first used the name \"John Manjiro.\" From this book came the name of \"John Manjiro.\"\nJohn Manjiro's English.\nManjiro had problems translating because he was not good at translating English sentences. This was because he had not learned basic grammar when he was young. He was used as interpreter when Commodore Perry came in 1863. Manjiro pronounced English just as he heard it. His pronunciation was different from present-day English. Japanese based their pronunciation of English at the time on Manjiro\u2019s pronunciation. They were able to be understood by Americans and English people.\nThe John Manjiro Musical.\nThere is a musical about Manjiro in Japan. It is called \"The Dream of John Manjiro\". It was first done in June, 1974.\nTrivia.\nJohn Manjiro was the first Japanese man to set foot on the contintental United States, to take a train, to ride a steamship, and to wear a necktie. John Manjiro talked about world views with Ryoma Sakamoto, a famous Japanese statesman and general."}

However, because they are so far away, it takes a long time for us to see that they have moved, and even then it takes a powerful telescope to see the difference. Because of this, for a long time, most people thought that the stars did not move at all. Even the ancient Greeks, who knew a lot about the stars and discovered some of the other ways they move, such as stellar precession, did not discover proper motion (although they probably suspected it). \nProper motion was not proved to exist until 1718 when Edmond Halley noticed the stars Sirius, Arcturus and Aldebaran had moved from the places they were in star charts that Hipparchus had drawn around 130 BC. However, even after more than 1,800 years, they had moved less than half a degree.\nProper motion is useful to astronomers in figuring out how far away a star is from Earth because stars that are close usually have a larger proper motion (meaning they move faster across the sky) than stars that are farther away. For example, Barnard's star has the largest proper motion of any star, moving 10.3 arcseconds per year. This is equal to one quarter of a degree, or half the diameter of the Moon in the sky, in only 87 years. It is the second-closest star to the Earth at 5.98 light years away. Also, eight of the ten stars with the biggest proper motions are less than 15 light years away."}
{"id": "170258", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170258", "title": "Origin of birds", "text": "The origin of birds is one of the most interesting questions in palaeontology and evolution. Birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era.\nThomas Henry Huxley (\"Darwin's bulldog\"), who was a comparative anatomist, made a study of this nearly 150 years ago. He compared the first fossil bird, \"Archaeopteryx\", with a small theropod dinosaur, \"Compsognathus\". They are two fossils from the same place and time: the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, Germany. The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period, about 144 million years ago.\nHuxley's papers on \"Archaeopteryx\", and the origin of birds, were of great interest then, and still are. He showed that the two fossils were almost identical, except for the front limbs and feathers of \"Archaeopteryx\".\nHe united reptiles and birds under the title of Sauropsida, and thought that birds had evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs.\nModern ideas.\nAll palaeontologists since Huxley agreed that \"Archaeopteryx\" evolved from reptiles, but many thought it was derived from an earlier type than dinosaurs. It took a long time before they agreed with Huxley. Almost all now think that early members of a group of small carnivorous dinosaur were ancestral to birds.\nThe group most favoured as ancestral is the Paraves or Eumaniraptora, which includes the dromaeosaurs and the troodonts. The dromaeosaurs include \"Velociraptor\" and \"Deinonychus\" but, of course, it would have been an earlier type of dromaeosaur, perhaps from the lower Jurassic. Dromaeosaurs have several traits we used to think were special to birds: hollow bones with holes for air-sacs, limbs with many bones either lost or fused, clavicles fused into wishbones, and feathers.\nThe discovery of feathered dinosaurs and birds in the Lower Cretaceous of China was what finally convinced palaeontologists. What seems to have happened is this. Theropod dinosaurs evolved feathers for heat regulation rather than flight. From then, a small group began to use them for primitive flight. This group is represented in the Jurassic by \"Archaeopteryx\" and \"Anchiornis\".\nMosaic of old and new.\nHuxley had pointed out that \"Archaeopteryx\" was a mixture of reptile and bird features. Without the feathers and arms, its skeleton looked just like that of \"Compsognathus\". We now know its bone growth physiology was much slower than modern birds, and more like that of its dinosaur ancestors. This means it would take longer after hatching before it could fly. A modern precocial bird takes for 3\u20136 weeks from hatching to flying. In \"Archaeopteryx\" this milestone might have taken about 18 weeks. It might have taken two to three years to reach its final adult size. The evolution of the physiology of modern forms occurred later in the group's history. They have had over 140 million years to evolve after \"Archaeopteryx\". This is an example of mosaic evolution, where some characters in a transitional form are basal, while others are remarkably advanced.\nChinese bird fossils.\nJurassic fossils.\n\"Anchiornis huxlei\" is so far the only dinobird fossil known which lived before \"Archaeopteryx\". It was found in Liaoning, China. The strata dates to the mid-late Jurassic period, 160 to 155 million years ago. There are also feather-bearing non-flying dinosaurs from the Jurassic of China, such as the maniraptoran \"Epidexipteryx\". \"Epidexipteryx\" is the earliest known example of ornamental feathers in the fossil record, about 152 to 168 million years ago.\n\"Anchiornis\" had large wings, made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand (as in modern birds) as well as flight feathers on the hind legs, forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings. The forewing of \"Anchiornis\" was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers. The primary feathers in \"Anchiornis\" indicated poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relatives. In \"Microraptor\" and \"Archaeopteryx\", the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear long, narrow, and pointed. However, in \"Anchiornis\", the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.\nSo the animal could glide, but probably not fly.\nCretaceous fossils.\nFlying gave the birds access to many new habitats, and an adaptive radiation took place. We see the results of this rapid evolution in the Chinese fossils from the Lower Cretaceous, which are more varied, and mostly more advanced, than \"Archaeopteryx\". There are now 31 different bird genera from the Lower Cretaceous of China. It is also clear, from the tail feathers of \"Confuciusornis\" (one of the Chinese fossils), that some of these birds were already using feathers for signalling and display, just as they do today. Like heat regulation, using feathers for display may be much earlier than flight. \"Confuciusornis\" is the fifth oldest bird fossil, about 25 million years after \"Archaeopteryx\". \nMost dinosaurs died out in the K/T extinction event, at the end of the Cretaceous. The only ones that survived were the birds. The birds, therefore, are not just the descendents of reptiles, but the descendents of theropod dinosaurs. Birds are the last surviving dinosaurs.\nColour of feathers.\nThe pigments preserved in a 120 million year old fossil bird have been revealed using X-rays. A team scanned the beautifully preserved fossils of \"Gansus yumenensis\" and \"Confuciusornis sanctus\". Their study, published in the journal \"Science\", revealed the chemical fingerprint of pigments that once tinted the ancient bird's feathers. The trace metal copper is a marker for the dark pigment eumelanin. \"The X-ray technique was so sensitive that it was able to show that each molecule of copper it detected was being tugged and squashed into a particular shape because it was bound within a eumelanin molecule\".\nResearch of this kind has now been repeated several times.\nDinobirds.\nThis is an informal grouping of theropods closest related to birds. These groups are small dinosaurs. They definitely have pennaceous feathers (like birds), and therefore probably temperature regulation. One proposed classification is:\nThe earliest example of a dinobird is a troodont, \"Anchiornis huxlei\", from the Upper Jurassic. This specimen pre-dates \"Archaeopteryx\" by 5\u201310 million years, and predates any other feathered dinosaur from its location (Liaoning Province, China) by 25\u201335 million years. This species had long feathers on its hind limbs as well as fore limbs, and could glide, but probably not fly.\nAt least this clade of theropods had well-developed genuine feathers before the first known bird. Feathering in other groups of theropods is still uncertain. One compsognathid, \"Sinosauropteryx\", has plumaceous feathers, as does \"Shuvuuia\", another small theropod. Apparently, many small theropods carried feathers, whose function was thermoregulation (to keep warm).\nExtinction event.\nThere is now evidence that many early bird groups went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period (K/T extinction event). This is the same time that the other dinosaurs went extinct.\nResearchers dated the fossils to within 300,000 years of the boundary layer at the end of the Cretaceous.\nA May 2018 report, in \"Current Biology\", says that its authors think that the birds that survived the end-of-Cretaceous disaster were Neornithes, Neognathae (Galloanserae + Neoaves). They were not tree-living, and could not fly far. After the world-wide destruction of forests, it took a long time for the world's forests to return properly. Virtually the same conclusions were already reached before, in a 2017 book on avian evolution.\nOrigin of modern birds.\nAll living birds are Neornithes, a subclass in traditional taxonomy. The Ornithurae is the natural group made up of modern birds and their extinct relatives. Their relatives include \"Ichthyornis\" and \"Hesperornis\", and some of the Chinese Cretaceous birds. They all have a plough-shaped pygostyle, a bone at the end of the tail which allows the tail feathers to fan and retract. Other groups of birds became extinct in the K/T extinction event.\n\"Gansus\" is a genus of aquatic birds that lived during the Lower Cretaceous, somewhere between 115 to 105 million years ago in what is now Gansu province, western China. It may be the oldest-known of the Ornithurae, depending how that group is defined.\nUnder any definition, all living birds, including taxa as diverse as ostriches, hummingbirds and eagles, are descended from basal ornithurans, many of which were semi-aquatic. It is now thought possible that all modern birds descended specifically from a semi-aquatic bird similar to \"Gansus\". Thus, while \"Gansus\" is not necessarily a direct ancestor of today's birds, it is closely related to such an ancestral species."}

It contained the evils to be let loose on mankind. When the box was empty, hope remained. The actual evils are not specified by Hesiod.\nWhere the word box is from.\nThe word in the original text is \"pithos\", which usually refers to a large container; used to store wine or other things. Such containers were also used for funerals. In the case of Pandora, this jar may have been made of clay for use as storage as in the usual sense, or, instead, of bronze metal as an unbreakable prison.\nThe mistranslation of \"pithos\" as \"box\" is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam. Erasums is thought to have made the error when he translated Hesiod's tale of Pandora into Latin. Hesiod's \"pithos\" refers to a storage jar for oil or grain. Erasmus, however, translated \"pithos\" into the Latin word \"pyxis\", meaning \"box\". The phrase \"Pandora's box\" has endured ever since. This error was further backed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti's painting \"Pandora\"."}

Longshore drift always moves in the direction of the main wind. If longshore drift continues for a long time, beaches can be changed quite a bit. The changes depend on the details, and vary from place to place. Longshore drift is the net (average) movement of sand grains across a beach in a zig-zag motion.\nThere are many inexpensive and effective ways of controlling longshore drift. The most common method is groynes (wooden walls that the sand builds up against). Some people dislike groynes because they interfere with walking along the beach, and the look of the beach."}

Gatorade is currently manufactured by PepsiCo, distributed in over 80 countries. The beverage was first developed in 1965 by researchers at the University of Florida, to replenish the combination of water, carbohydrates, and electrolytes that the school's student-athletes lost (in sweat) during rigorous athletic competitions. Its name was derived from the collective nickname of the university's athletic teams, \"the Gators\".\nOriginally produced and marketed by Stokely-Van Camp, the Gatorade brand was purchased by the Quaker Oats Company in 1983, who was bought out by PepsiCo in 2001. As of 2010, Gatorade is PepsiCo\u2019s 4th-largest brand, on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales. It primarily competes with Coca-Cola's Powerade and Vitaminwater brands worldwide; plus, Lucozade Sport in the United Kingdom. Within the United States, Gatorade accounts for approximately 75 percent market share in the sports drink category.\nOther flavours.\nThere are many other flavours of Gatorade, including:\nAdvertising and endorsements.\nGatorade is the official sports drink of NASCAR, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, USA Basketball, National Hockey League, Association of Volleyball Professionals, US Soccer Federation, Major League Soccer, and other professional and collegiate athletic organizations, providing supplies of the drinks to sponsored teams in some cases. Distribution was extended to include the U.K. in 2008, coinciding with an agreement designating Gatorade as the official sports drink of the Chelsea F.C. Gatorade's 1991 \"Be Like Mike\" ads featured Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, a North American basketball team which had just won its first National Basketball Association championship at the time. The ads began airing in August 1991 and the phrase \"Be Like Mike\" became household lingo in America. In more recent years, the Gatorade brand has continued to employ professional sports athletes in the promotion of its products. Primary endorsers in the 2000s have included Major League Baseball player Derek Jeter, National Hockey League player Sidney Crosby, National Basketball Association player Dwyane Wade, PGA Tour golfer Tiger Woods, and National Football League quarterback Peyton Manning. Gatorade is the official sports drink of 's home video affiliate, Viva Video, Inc.\nIn popular culture.\nGatorade has been the subject of substantial media attention and reference in popular culture situations, most of which are in relation to team or individual athletic sports. The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the Gatorade shower, originally called the \"Gatorade Dunk,\" where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler, sneak up behind the head coach, and pour the contents of the cooler (generally Gatorade and ice) over his head at the end of an American football game. This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when Harry Carson and Jim Burt, of the New York Giants, doused head coach Bill Parcells during the 1985 season. Burt's teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team's championship season of 1986-87. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports.\nGatorade has also achieved status as the clich\u00e9 representative for sports drinks in American media, for example, in the film Clerks, the character Dante is at one point forced to give free Gatorade to his hockey teammates, and in the film \"The Waterboy\", Adam Sandler is told that \"the water sucks\" and that Gatorade is superior."}

The term 'Roaring' applies here, as art, society and culture were rapidly improving and therefore 'Roaring'. Prohibition was in place and so North America was a very 'wise' and 'clean-cut' place to be.\nEconomy.\nThe North American economy during the 1920s was doing very well because World War I had just ended. Many new products were being made for the consumer. Products were being produced on a huge scale throughout North America, one example of these products is the 'Model T Ford', a car that was seen in every state of the USA.\nCulture.\nThe culture of the Roaring Twenties was very different from before. Women's roles were changed. Liberal young women, called flappers, wore short skirts, cut their hair short, and listened to a new form of music called jazz. Women had gotten the right to vote. Writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway were called the Lost Generation because they moved out of the United States after the war. African-American art and culture also grew a lot during the Harlem Renaissance.\nProblems of the Roaring Twenties.\nEven though North America was doing very well in terms of prosperity, a lot of problems still arose. One of the main problems in North America during the 1920s was Organized Crime. Gangs of foreign immigrants were importing illegal alcohol, tobacco, firearms etc. One of the most famous gangsters of this time was Al Capone."}

Roughly, it is a set of things (called points) along with a way to know which things are close together.\nMore precisely, a topological space has a certain kind of set, called \"open sets\". Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points \"near\" another point, called a neighbourhood of the point. A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point. If one did not have the concept of open sets, one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way. If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as \"any\" set containing that point, it might just include that point and that point only, not any points near it, or points far away.\nWe also have the concept of \"closed sets\", which are complements of open sets. That is, all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set.\nOpen sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness. The union of any number of open sets must be open, and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed. (The second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets. That is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed. Any set is made of points. If the second rule applied to an infinite number of closed sets, then \"every\" set would be closed.) As a special case, the set containing every point is both open and closed. The set containing no points is also both open and closed.\nA set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is. One can think of only certain sets as open, or more sets as open. One might even consider every set to be open. The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces."}

The movie stars Bruce Willis, Steve Carell, Garry Shandling, William Shatner, Avril Lavigne and Nick Nolte.\nPlot.\nWhile searching for food, RJ the raccoon goes into the cave of Vincent the bear, who has a wagon full of human food taken from a nearby rest stop. RJ accidentally wakes Vincent from his deep sleep of hibernation, and in a race to escape, causes the food cart to roll out onto the nearby highway and get run over by a large truck. To avoid being eaten himself, RJ promises Vincent that he will completely replace all that food within the week.\nRJ finds a nearby, recently-built suburban housing development separated from a tree forest by a large hedge. There he discovers a pack of animals recently awoken from their hibernation, led by Verne the turtle. The others include squirrel Hammy, skunk Stella, porcupines Penny and Lou, along with their triplet sons, Spike, Bucky and Quillo; and opossum Ozzie and his daughter Heather. The animals are scared, as the development had been built during their hibernation, and they fear they will be unable to search for food in the small forest. RJ shows them the amount of food humans get and waste and suggests they forage from the humans. Verne is hesitant but the other animals agree. They make bold attempts to steal food directly from the humans, with RJ secretly directing them to help collect the food he needs to replace Vincent's stash.\nWhen the animals raid the trash cans of the homeowners-association chairwoman Gladys Sharp, she calls an animal exterminator named Dwayne LaFontant, who agrees to put an illegal, lethal trap called the \"Depelter Turbo\" in her backyard. Verne sees this and tries to warn the others, but RJ says they will be okay. Fearing for the safety of the pack, Verne attempts to return what they stole; he and RJ argue, causing a small rampage through the development during a chase with a large, quick dog named Nugent and destroying the stash RJ had collected for Vincent. After a brief argument, RJ and Verne make up and RJ rallies the others to raid Gladys' home directly on the night before a large party. With skunk Stella disguised as a cat to distract Gladys' own cat, Tiger, the others enter Gladys' home and collect all the food. RJ inadvertently reveals his duplicity to the animals, just as they are found by Gladys who calls Dwayne. RJ escapes with the food but leaves the other animals to be captured by Dwayne.\nAs RJ brings the food to Vincent, he is overcome by remorse, and instead uses the stash to knock Dwayne's truck off the road, and makes Vincent mad. Dwayne is knocked out while the animals get free, and Spike, Bucky and Quillo use skills they learned from a videogame to drive the truck back to the development. Verne convinces the group to forgive RJ since he came back to save them, and they save him from Vincent. They return the truck to the development, crashing through Gladys' home, and the animals flee into the hedge. Gladys and Dwayne converge on the animals from one side with a yard trimmer and a cattle prod, respectively, while Vincent tries to swipe at them from the other. To escape, RJ gives Hammy an energy drink, allowing the hyperactive squirrel to move very, very fast. Hammy causes Vincent, Gladys, and Dwayne to be trapped by the Depelter Turbo while the animals escape. The police and animal control arrive, and Vincent is sent to the Rocky Mountains, while the lady Gladys is arrested for using the illegal Depelter Turbo, and Dwayne attempts escape only to run into Nugent the dog, who bites him on the leg.\nRJ and Verne apologize to each other. RJ is brought into the group, as is Tiger, who became love-struck with Stella even after learning she was a skunk. Verne realizes they have not had a chance to search for food until Hammy reveals that while sped up, he had collected enough nuts for the group to last the year."}

It takes inputs (ingredients) and produces an output (the completed dish).\nThe words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian mathematician called Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (Persian: \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645\u06cc, c. 780\u2013850).\nInformally, an algorithm can be called a \"list of steps\". Algorithms can be written in ordinary language, and that may be all a person needs.\nIn computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by a Turing machine.\nFor the purpose of computing, algorithms are written in pseudocode, flow charts, or programming languages.\nComparing algorithms.\nThere is usually more than one way to solve a problem. There may be many different recipes to make a certain dish which looks different but ends up tasting the same when all is said and done. The same is true for algorithms. However, some of these ways will be better than others. If a recipe needs lots of complicated ingredients that you do not have, it is not as a good as a simple recipe. When we look at algorithms as a way of solving problems, often we want to know how long it would take a computer to solve the problem using a particular algorithm. When we write algorithms, we like our algorithm to take the least amount of time so that we can solve our problem as quickly as possible.\nIn cooking, some recipes are more difficult to do than others, because they take more time to finish or have more things to keep track of.\nIt is the same for algorithms, and algorithms are better when they are easier for the computer to do. The thing that measures the difficulty of an algorithm is called \"complexity\". When we ask how complex an algorithm is, often we want to know how long it will take a computer to solve the problem we want it to solve.\nSorting.\nThis is an example of an algorithm for sorting cards with colors on them into piles of the same color:\nSorting by numbers.\nThese are examples of algorithms for sorting a stack of cards with many different numbers, so that the numbers are in order.\nPlayers start with a stack of cards that have not been sorted.\nFirst algorithm.\nThis algorithm goes through the stack of cards, one card at a time. This card is compared to the next card in the stack. Please note that this position only changes in step 6. This algorithm is called bubble sort. It is slow.\nStep-by-step example.\nLet us take a stack of the cards with the numbers \"5 1 4 2 8\", and sort it from smallest number to biggest one using this algorithm. In each step, the algorithm compares the elements written in bold. The top of the stack of cards is on the left-hand side.\nFirst pass:\n( 5 1 4 2 8 ) formula_1 ( 1 5 4 2 8 ) Here, the algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps them.\n( 1 4 2 5 8 ) formula_1 ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) These elements are already in order, so the algorithm does not swap them.\nSecond pass:\nNow, the stack of cards is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know this. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.\nThird pass:\nFinally, the array is sorted, and the algorithm can stop.\nHistory.\nThis is an easy-to-understand algorithm for sorting. Computer scientists called it \"Bubble sort\", because smaller elements will rise to the top, changing their position in each run. Unfortunately, the algorithm is not very good, because it needs a long time (many passes through the stack of cards) to sort it.\nSecond algorithm.\nThis algorithm uses another idea. Sometimes solving a problem is difficult, but the problem can be changed so it is made of simpler problems that are easier to solve. This is called recursion. It is more difficult to understand than the first example, but it will give a better algorithm.\nMerging two stacks together.\nThis works with two stacks of cards. One of them is called A, the other is called B. There is a third stack that is empty at the start, called C. At the end, it will contain the result.\nHistory.\nJohn von Neumann developed this algorithm in 1945. He did not call it \"Sorting by numbers\", he called it \"Mergesort\". It is a very good algorithm for sorting, compared to others.\nThird algorithm.\nThe first algorithm takes much longer to sort the cards than the second, but it can be improved (made better). Looking at bubble sort, it can be noticed that cards with high numbers move from the top of the stack quite quickly, but cards with low numbers at the bottom of the stack take a long time to \"rise\" (move to the top).\nTo improve the first algorithm here is the idea:\nHistory.\nThis algorithm was developed by C. A. R. Hoare in 1960. It is one of most widely used algorithms for sorting today. It is called \"Quicksort\".\nPutting algorithms together.\nIf players have cards with colors and numbers on them, they can sort them by color and number if they do the \"sorting by colors\" algorithm, then do the \"sorting by numbers\" algorithm to each colored stack, then put the stacks together.\nThe sorting-by-numbers algorithms are more difficult to do than the sorting-by-colors algorithm, because they may have to do the steps again many times. One would say that sorting by numbers is more \"complex\"."}

He was also the first black person with an African background to come to Australia. He was the first bushranger to have a reward offered for his capture.\nEarly life.\nCaesar was most likely born in Madagascar, in about 1763. He was a slave on a sugar plantation (farm) in the West Indies. He ran away and went to London. On 17 March 1786, he was in court at Deptford, Kent for stealing 240 shillings. He was sent to the new country called Australia as a convict for seven years. He left on the Alexander, a convict transport ship in the First Fleet, in May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788.\nConvict life for Black Caesar.\nOn 29 April 1789 he was caught stealing food. Two weeks later he escaped into the bush, taking food, an iron cooking pot, and a musket (gun) taken from a sea army officer (Marine) named Abraham Hand. He could not catch enough animals to eat, and he began to steal food from the settlement. On 26 May he stole food from a brick making gang at Brickfield Hill and was nearly caught. On June 6 he tried to steal food from Zachariah Clark, who was the assistant in charge of the new colony's food supplies. Caesar was caught by a convict named William Saltmarsh.\nIn July 1789, David Collins, the colony's Judge-Advocate, said that John Caesar was the hardest working convict in the new colony. He said that he was a large man with a lot of muscles, but he was always hungry. He would eat food meant to last two days in one meal, and would then need to steal more food from others. All his thefts were about getting more food.\nAfter he was captured, Collins said Caesar was a \"wretch\" (a miserable person) who did not care if he died. Caesar told Collins that he would make it if was hanged, he would turn into a joke by playing a trick on the executioner. Governor Arthur Phillip however, thought Caesar would be more use working and sent him to Garden Island, where he would work in with his legs tied with iron chain. He was well behaved and the chains were soon taken off.\nEscape.\nCaesar soon escaped again; on 22 December used a canoe to get off the island, taking a week's worth of food. He stole a musket, and lived by taking food from gardens and taking the food of Aboriginals after scaring them away with his gun. After he lost the gun at Rose Hill, and was attacked by the Aborigines, leaving him wounded in several places. He gave himself up on the 31 December to an officer at Rose Hill.\nOn 6 March 1790, Caesar was sent to Norfolk Island. There he had one daughter, later named Mary Ann Fisher Power, to Ann (e) Power. He was taken back to Sydney in 1793, and began stealing from the farms and huts again. He was caught and then flogged (hit 500 times with a whip). This did not make any difference; Caesar said that \"all that would not make him better.\"\nBushranger.\nIn 1795 Black Caesar ran away for the last time, and formed a gang of runaways. On 29 January 1796, a reward of five gallons of rum was offered by Governor John Hunter for his capture. Every day there were reports of missing things, but he was able to avoid being captured until 15 February. A man named Wimbow, who had been searching for days, found him in an area of thick bush called Liberty Plains and shot him. He died soon after. "}

In the 1500's, soldiers armed with a heavy arquebus, called a musket, supported the arquebusiers and the pikemen. By the start of 1700's, a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus. When the bayonet was added, there was no longer a need for pikemen, and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers. The first musket made in the united States was the Springfield Model 1795 Musket. In the 1800's, better ammunition and ways of firing the gun, meant that rifling was practical for military use, and the rifled musket became common. A few years later, the use of cartridges, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the \"rifled musket\" gave way to the rifle, and \"muskets\" were no longer used.\nMusket calibres ranged from to . A smoothbore musket, firing at a single target, was only accurate to about to . Rifled muskets in the 1850's were much better, able to hit a man sized target at up to . The advantage of this longer distance was shown at the Battle of Four Lakes, where Springfield Model 1855 rifled muskets killed Indian warriors before they could get close enough with their smoothbore muskets. However, in the Italian War of 1859, French forces were able to defeat the longer range of Austrian rifle muskets by quick, small attacks and bayonet attacks at close range."}

The neutral antimatter they are working to trap is antihydrogen. This is the antimatter version of hydrogen, the first atom in the periodic table. Antihydrogen, like hydrogen, has two oppositely charged particles. Hydrogen has a proton and an electron, and so antihydrogen would have an antiproton and a positron. A positron is the common name for the antielectron.\nCERN.\nThe ALPHA collaboration has its experiment at CERN in Geneva in Switzerland. CERN is the only place in the world that can provide \"slow\" antiprotons that can be easily captured by ALPHA. ALPHA then brings these antiprotons into contact with positrons and form antihydrogen. \nAntihydrogen has, like many atoms and especially hydrogen, a small magnetic dipole moment. A dipole moment is another way of saying that the atom behaves a bit as if it was a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole. Normally such small magnets are attracted to other magnets. However, some atoms in some states behave such that they are repelled by magnetic fields. This means that the atoms could possibly be trapped in space by making a minimum of the magnetic field. ALPHA is trying to do just that with antihydrogen. By a clever arrangement of magnets, ALPHA has a so-called magnetic minimum trap, in which antihydrogen may be trapped. \nThis is a difficult process. The magnetic forces on these atoms are quite weak, so the trap can only contain antihydrogen atoms of very low motional (kinetic) energy, that is at very low temperature. The current state-of-the-art ALPHA trap can contain antihydrogen atoms in their ground state if they are colder than about 0.5 Kelvin (i.e. 0.5 degrees above absolute zero). ALPHA is currently working on making such cold antihydrogen."}

In the 780s Egbert was forced into exile by Offa of Mercia and Beorhtric of Wessex, but on Beorhtric's death in 802 Egbert returned and took the throne. He was the father of Athelwulf of Wessex.\nEarly career.\nEgbert was the son of Ealhmund, King of Kent. He was descended from Ingeld, brother of Ine of Wessex. In 786 he made a bid for the throne of Wessex after the death of Cynewulf. Offa of Mercia however, made Beorhtric king instead. As a youth Egbert was seen as a problem for Beorhtric. He didn't want Egbert in England. While Beorhtric was negotiating to marry Offa's daughter he asked that Egbert be handed over to him. While Offa was considering doing just that, Egbert fled Mercia and at some point left England. He appears to have been welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years. This is at the time Frankish ports were closed to English ships and trading. Offa had offended Charlemagne by his son marry one of Charlemagne's daughters. While at the Frankish court Egbert married a noblewoman, Redburga. She was possibly a close relative of Charlemagne. Egbert and Redburga had a son born in Francia, Athelwulf, about 795. In 802 Beorhtric died. Egbert returned to become King of Wessex, probably with military aid from Charlemagne.\nKing of Wessex.\nHis first few years as king are not well recorded. It is very probable that he used this time to reorganize his army and his administration. Egbert formed an alliance with Wulfred, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 815 Egbert invaded Cornwall and brought it under his rule. He allowed sub-kings to rule it for him. In 825 the new king of Mercia, Beornwulf, invaded Wessex. Beornwulf had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex. In what Frank Stenton called \"one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history\" Egbert defeated Beornwulf. This was the end of the Mercian kings dominating England. Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub-king. As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert. Beornwulf tried to recover East Anglia later the same year and was killed in the attempt. Kent, Surrey and Sussex remained a part of the kingdom of Wessex from this time on. Essex was later lost to the Danes. Egbert appointed his son Athelwulf as sub-king of Kent which included all the new territories of Wessex.\nEgbert then defeated all of Mercia in 829. The king of Northumbria submitted to him after the defeat of Mercia. He assumed the title (King of Mercia). This title was also on coins made in the former Mercian port of London. In 830 Wiglaf returned to power in Mercia, but the gains of Kent and southwest England remained with Wessex. Egbert died 4 February 839. He left a territory larger than any other Wessex king since Ine. He was the \"bretwalda\" or overlord of Anglo-Saxon England until Wiglaf returned in 830. Even so, he remained the most powerful king during his time.\nFamily.\nTogether he and Redburga had:"}

It is a superstition found most often in East Asian areas, for example China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.\nThe Chinese word for \"four\" (, pinyin: s\u00ec, jyutping: sei3), sounds very similar to the word for \"death\" (, pinyin: s\u01d0, jyutping: sei2).\nChinese people take care not to use the number 4 during important holidays, or if someone in the family is sick. Numbers such as 14, 24, and so on, are not used because they also have the number 4 in them. Buildings sometimes do not have floors with these numbers, apartments and hotels do not have rooms with number 4, 14, 24 and so on. Table number 4, 14, 24, may be often left out in wedding dinners or other social activities in these countries. Where there are a lot of apartment buildings, buildings that should be 4, 14, 24, are called 3A, 13A, 23A, and so on.\nIn Hong Kong, some apartments such as Vision City and The Arch do not have the floors from 40 to 49. Immediately above 39/F is 50/F, leading many who do not know about tetraphobia to think that some floors are missing.\nThe Chinese start numbering their military aircraft with the number 5, such as the fighter plane \"Shenyang J-5\". The Taiwanese and the South Korean navies do not use the number 4 when giving flag numbers to their ships.\nIn cities where East Asian and Western cultures come together, like Hong Kong and Singapore, it is possible in some buildings that both 13 and 14 are left out as floor numbers, along with all the other 4s.\nIn Korea, tetraphobia is not as important, but the floor number 4 is almost always left out in hospitals. In other buildings, the fourth floor is sometimes named \"F\" (Four) instead of \"4\" in elevators. Apartment numbers with a lot of the number 4 (such as 404) are hard to sell, and often they are not worth as much money."}

He was the first of a dynasty of kings who ruled Scotland for over two centuries.\nCareer.\nMalcolm was born in 1031, the son of king Duncan I of Scotland and his wife; a cousin of Siward, Earl of Northumberland. When his father was killed in 1040 Malcolm did not succeed to the throne. At the time the system alternated between different lines of the same royal family. So the king chosen from a different royal line was Macbeth, who had killed Duncan I in battle. Malcolm killed Macbeth in battle in 1057, but Lulach, Macbeth's stepson was selected as king. This broke the pattern of alternate selection. Lulach ruled only ruled a few months until he was killed. Malcolm finally succeeded Lulach and changed the succession to his own sons and their descendants. This made Scotland like other European countries in keeping the same dynasty on the throne.\nKing of Scots.\nMalcolm was in his late twenties when he finally became king. Malcolm would lead a total of five raids into England starting in 1061. The Norman Conquest of England caused many to leave England. Malcolm welcomed several into Scotland. These included Edgar Atheling, his sisters Margaret and Christina as well as their mother. Raised at the court of St. Stephen of Hungary she was beautiful, wise, and very religious. Malcolm was at once taken with her and asked her to marry him. She refused as she and her sister were destined to be nuns. But after a time she finally accepted. By his marriage to Margaret he gained an interest in the English throne. \nEdgar Atheling joined the uprising in the North of England in 1069 but it failed and William the Conqueror sacked York as punishment. Malcolm joined in but too late as Edgar left England on a Danish ship. Malcolm had long claimed Cumbria and Northumberland and made another raid on Bamburgh. He took so many captives that it was said there was an English slave in every house in Scotland. In 1071 William came north with a large army. He came as far as Abernethy but Malcolm wanted peace. William agreed to give him twelve English manors and pay a yearly fee. Malcolm had to give his son Malcolm as a hostage but this made him a vassal of the English king. \nEdgar Atheling returned to Scotland the next year. He had been offered land on the border near Normandy by the French king. Malcolm told him to take it and settle down. He then gave Edgar gold and silver and sent him off to live in France. But Edgar soon returned having been shipwrecked on his journey. This time Malcolm advised him to make peace with king William of England. Edgar did and received a castle as a residence in England. In 1079 William and his son Robert were fighting in Normandy. Malcolm raided into England again being welcomed in Northumberland. But William sent his brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux north to punish Northumberland and Robert to raid into Scotland. Once more Robert and Malcolm settled their differences and were at peace again. In 1092, during the reign of William Rufus Malcolm raided England yet again. Peace was again renewed with William Rufus. But William failed in one of his promises to Malcolm, so in 1093 the Scots invaded England again. This time Malcolm III died while fighting at Alnwick Castle. His son Edward died there also. Margaret, his queen died of grief after hearing the news of the death of her husband and their son.\nFamily.\nAbout 1059 he married Ingibjorg, the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdson, Earl of Orkney. She was the daughter of Earl Finn Arnason. Together they had:\nHe married secondly Margaret of Wessex . They had eight children; six sons and two daughters, including:"}

A close friend of Ned Kelly's brother, Dan Kelly, Hart was caught up in the murder of three policemen at Stringybark Creek. He was killed during the siege at Glenrowan, Victoria.\nEarly life.\nHart was born at Three Mile Creek, near Wangaratta, Victoria, in 1859. His parents, Richard Hart and Bridget Young had come from Ireland. They had other children, Richard 'Dick' Hart (Jr.), Hugh Hart, Thomas Hart, Nicholas Hart, Esther 'Ettie' Hart, Jane Hart and Winifred Hart.\nHart was a small man, and a very good horse rider. His brother Nicholas was a jockey. One story says Steve worked as a jockey around Beechworth and Wangaratta, and won 'The Benalla Handicap' after a protest was upheld. He did not open farm gates, and always jumped them with his horse.\nCrime.\nIn 1877, Hart was sent to Beechworth Gaol for 12 months for stealing 13 horses. He met Dan Kelly while in prison. When he was let out of gaol he went to Bullock Creek to look for gold with Dan Kelly. He is reported to have said here's to \"...a short life, and a merry one.\" He was at Bullock Creek while Dan and Ned Kelly were in hiding from the police. The gang, which on that day included Joe Byrne, heard gunshots and discovered a police search party camped nearby at Stringybark Creek. The next day the gang went to the camp to take the policemen's guns. Three policemen were killed and the gang were made outlaws, which meant that they could be captured dead or alive for a reward. At this time the police did not know Hart was a member of the gang. As a member of the Kelly Gang he often rode around in women's clothes to avoid being caught. During the search for the Kelly Gang, the police were told to stop women riders to see if they were really women. The stories of how Ned's sister, Kate Kelly, did things to help the gang, were probably really about Steve Hart.\nBushranger.\nHart took part in the bank robberies at Euroa and Jerilderie. At Euroa he met an old school friend of his, Francis 'Fanny' Shaw (sometimes known as Maggie Shaw) and through her, the police found out his name. Hart also stole a watch from Robert Scott, the bank manager. When a bank worker, Bob Booth, asked him for something to remember the visit by, Hart gave him a lead bullet carved with the letter 'H'.\nAt Jerilderie in 1879, the Kelly gang held many people hostage in the Royal Hotel before robbing the bank. Hart stole a watch from Reverend Gribble, a parson at the Protestant church. Ned told Hart he was a common thief and made him give the watch back. After Jerilderie, Hart went into hiding with the gang for most of 1879, although Hart did go to a St.Kilda doctor to be treated for a foot problem.\nGlenrowan.\nIn June 1880 Ned Kelly came up with a plan to get his mother released from prison. Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Beechworth and killed their friend Aaron Sherritt who they thought was a police spy. They knew this would bring many police by train to Beechworth to capture them. In the meantime Hart and Ned Kelly had gone to Glenrowan and forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks. They hoped the police train would crash, and then wearing home made armour they would capture the surviving policemen. These would be held as hostages until Ellen Kelly was set free.\nHart and Kelly forced many people of the town into a small hotel owned by Ann Jones. They were joined by Dan Kelly and Byrne who had ridden quickly across country from Beechworth. They waited at the hotel for the police. The plan failed when news of the Sherritt murder took a long time to reach Melbourne. The people kept at the hotel were becoming difficult to keep under control. Ned Kelly let one man go free at 3.00am, the school teacher Thomas Curnow, who said he had to get home to his wife. Instead he went to the train line and was able to stop the police train safely. The police went to the hotel and began shooting. It is estimated that 15,000 bullets were fired. Joe Byrne was shot dead in the front room of the hotel. Ned Kelly left the hotel in the early morning, probably to meet with other men who were going to help him capture the train. He was captured by the police.\nAt 10.00am the police were forced to stop shooting to allow some of the hostages to escape. Several, including the hotel owner's son had been shot dead. Dan Kelly's sister, Maggie Skillion, and a Catholic priest Father Gibney tried to go to the hotel to tell Steve and Dan to give themselves up, but were stopped by the police. The police wanted a cannon to be sent from Melbourne so they could blast the two men out. At 2.30pm the police set the hotel on fire, and Father Gibney rushed inside. Gibney saw the bodies of Hart and Dan Kelly lying side by side in a room at the back of the hotel, with their heads resting on blankets. They had removed the armour which was placed beside them. It is most likely they had killed themselves.\nDeath.\nThe bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were unable to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart. Hart's body, little more than a blackened stump was buried at Greta Cemetery the following day, June 29, 1880, in the same grave as Dan Kelly. He was 21 years old. After the grave was filled in, the whole area was ploughed over to keep the site of the grave hidden. The family was worried that the police would still try to get the bodies. Hart's armour is now on display at the Victoria Police Museum in Melbourne.\nOver the years there have been claims that Hart and Dan Kelly did not die at the hotel, but escaped and went to live in Queensland. A man named Billy Meade, as he was dying in 1938, told a nurse he was really Hart. Another story says Hart and Dan Kelly went to South Africa. After serving in the Second Boer War; also called the South African War, they went to India, where Hart is said to have drowned himself in Calcutta in 1917. There is no evidence to prove these stories."}

The teams are not eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup or any continental confederation championships. FIFA's statutes do not allow member teams to compete against these sides without FIFA's prior permission.\nThis section lists:\nUnaffiliated United Nations states.\nThere are seven United Nations member and observer states which are not members of FIFA or any of its affiliated continental confederations. Six of them, however, have fielded national teams in unofficial friendlies, Olympic-level tournaments (such as the Pacific Games or Micronesian Games), or in tournaments held outside the auspices of FIFA. These teams are listed below. Some of these teams have been run by a football federation in their country of origin, while others have only been organized informally.\nThe Marshall Islands and Nauru are the only UN member states with no recorded national football teams.\nUnaffiliated non-UN states.\nThere are eleven states with limited international recognition, de facto sovereign states, and associated states who are not members or observers of the United Nations. Four of these have national teams which are listed above: the Republic of China, which is a member of FIFA and the AFC (as Chinese Taipei); the Cook Islands, which is a member of FIFA and the OFC; Kosovo, which is a member of FIFA and UEFA; and Niue, who has no membership in FIFA but is an associate member of the OFC.\nNone of the remaining seven de facto sovereign or partially recognized states are members of FIFA or any of its affiliated continental confederations. Six of them, however, have fielded national teams in non-FIFA football matches and unofficial friendlies:\nThe national associations representing all six of these teams are members of ConIFA, an organization for teams representing unrecognized states, subnational regions, and stateless minorities. Another de facto sovereign state, Transnistria, is also a member of ConIFA. To date, however, it has no recorded national football team.\nOthers.\nFIFA's entry criteria state that:\nThe main condition for joining FIFA is thus general international recognition as a nation state and membership of the UN. However, this rule is not applied retroactively, and 26 of FIFA's members are not internationally recognised sovereign nations.\nNon-sovereign associations may still join FIFA or its affiliated confederations in specific circumstances. FIFA have offered exceptions for associations representing a dependency where the application apply for membership is authorised by the association in its parent state. The New Caledonia team was admitted under this regulation in 2004 on the grounds of the distance of New Caledonia from its 'parent' nation, France. The applications for membership by Gibraltar, a territory of the UK and Kosovo, a sovereign state with limited international recognition, were both initially rejected by FIFA in line with the above policy. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport has rejected this decision and both teams were accepted in May 2016.\nA variety of other national, separatist, sub-national, pseudo-national, and ethnic teams have formed international football organizations outside FIFA's jurisdiction, and play in international tournaments against each other. Two organisations have been created as alternatives to FIFA. The older of the two, the N.F.-Board (Nouvelle F\u00e9d\u00e9ration-Board), was founded in 2001 to promote international football among sovereign nations, unrecognised nations, regions and stateless peoples that are not members of FIFA, and to assist in their possible future membership of FIFA. A total of 49 member associations nations were listed on the N.F. Board's website as of March 2016, although at least one of these (Monaco) is no longer a member. In 2013, a new organisation, the Confederation of Independent Football Associations (ConIFA), was founded to carry on this work, with a number of its members having previously been affiliated to the NF-Board. ConIFA was founded with the aim of regularising non-FIFA international football, by having a two-year international tournament cycle, with the ConIFA World Football Cup in even numbered years, and continental tournaments in odd-numbered years.\nIn some cases, participation in non-FIFA football has been a first step for teams who later sought (and in some cases, achieved) the right to participate in matches sanctioned by FIFA or one of its affiliated continental confederations. For example, both Kosovo and Gibraltar played in non-FIFA football tournaments before being recognized by FIFA and UEFA. Similarly, the British Crown Dependency of Jersey, whose national team has been active in non-FIFA football for decades, has applied to join UEFA.\nFormer national football teams.\nThese national teams no longer exist due to the dissolution of the nation or territory that they represented. Only national teams that were once members of FIFA are listed below.\nNew names.\nIn addition to the above, other nations have been renamed:"}

In particular, it is in several very old Greek translations of the Bible but is not in the Hebrew Bible. There has been a lot of debate over whether or not the psalm should be considered part of the Bible.\nPsalm 151 and the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nThe psalm has been known about for a long time and the Greek version was used for study for hundreds of years. When the Dead Sea Scrolls (which are in Hebrew) were found and translated, part of Psalm 151 was in them. This surprised the researchers very much, but not as much as what they would find later on.\nAfter studying the scrolls, they noticed that the Greek translator had actually made a mistake. Two different pieces of two different psalms were treated like they were one big psalm when they were not. There is a big change in the Greek version after the fifth line (where the second psalm fragment would begin) and is a lot more like a story than most of the other psalms, which are more like poems.\nContent.\nThe Greek version of the psalm says that it was written by King David after his battle with Goliath. It talks about how, even though David was the least of all his brothers, God chose him to be king.

Kate was their seventh child. The family moved to Avenel soon after her birth, where another child, Grace, was born. John Kelly died of dropsy when Kate was four years old. Ellen Kelly then moved the family to her sister's house at Greta. One year later, the family moved again, to a two-room hut on their own land at Eleven Mile Creek. Kate helped her mother bring up the family, which included three more children by Ellen's second husband, George King.\nThe Fitzpatrick incident.\nThe Kellys had already had a long history of trouble with the police. Alexander Fitzpatrick, a young policeman, went to the house on 15 April 1878. He was drunk, and said he wanted to arrest Dan Kelly for horse stealing. He sexually assaulted Kate, and her family tried to help her. Historians can not agree on what really happened next.\nFitzpatrick went back to Benalla Police Station and said that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the head with shovel. He also said that Dan Kelly had hit him, and Ned Kelly had tried to shoot him. William Skillion, Kate's brother-in-law, and William Williamson a neighbour of the Kellys, were also said to have hurt him. Ned Kelly said that he was not at the house, but working on a farm 400 miles away, though most historians believe he was at the house with Joe Byrne.\nEllen Kelly was sent to prison for three years for trying to kill Fitzpatrick; Williamson and Skillion were sent for six year. Ned and Dan Kelly hid at Bullock Creek, in the Wombat Ranges, so the police could not find them. On the 25 October 1878, at Stringybark Creek, they met four policemen who had been sent to arrest them. Three of the policemen were killed. Ned, Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart were made outlaws, and turned to bank robbery.\nBrave Kate Kelly.\nWith their mother in prison, and their brothers being hunted by the police, Kate Kelly and her sister Margaret looked after the younger children. Kate also helped trick the police, leading the police away when they got close to her brothers. She supplied the Kelly Gang with food, ammunition, and news about the police hunt. The folk song, \"Ye Sons of Australia\" has a part about Kate helping the Kelly Gang; \nThe song places Kate Kelly at the siege at Glenrowan;\nHistorians now think that many of the actions thought to have been carried out by Kate, was really gang member Steve Hart in a dress.\nNed Kelly's capture.\nFollowing Ned's arrest, Kate would often visit him in prison, as well as raising money for legal costs. She got people to sign petitions asking for mercy for Ned. Kate begged on her knees in front of the Governor, His Excellency the Marquis of Normanby, to save her brother's life. Ned was hanged on 11 November 1880.\nLife after Ned.\nOn the night of the hanging, Kate and her brother Jim Kelly, went on stage at the Appollo Hall in Melbourne. People paid one shilling to see them sitting on the stage. Kate and Jim went to Sydney and continued to appear on stage, with Jim riding Ned Kelly's horse. The police stopped the shows. She was seen performing as \"Ada\" in a Sydney \"Wild West Show\", and then in Adelaide under the names Ada Hennessey and Kate Ambrose. She stopped performing due to ill health. She worked for a short time at \"Hill Scott's Hotel\" in Adelaide, before her poor health forced her to return home to Greta. She worked as a servant in Wangaratta, and a maid in Lanceby. \nOn 25 November 1888, she married William Henry Foster, a blacksmith, and lived in the town of Forbes. They had six children, though three died when they were still babies.\nOn 6 October 1898, Kate was reported missing. She was found drowned eight days later, in a swamp near Forbes. Some historians think that she may have taken her own life because she had depression, brought on by the death of her sister, Maggie, two years earlier. She was buried in the Forbes Cemetery, aged 35.\nDescendants.\nAfter her death, her three children, Frederick Arthur, Gertrude Eileen Ada, and Ethel Maude, went to live with Ellen Kelly at Eleven Mile Creek. Frederick Arthur became a beekeeper in the town of Myrrhee and died in World War I. Gertrude married Arthur Cavanagh, a builder. They lived in Wangaratta and looked after Ellen Kelly in her old age. Ethel married Albert Hibbert, and also looked after Ellen Kelly."}

Spacetime goes toward infinite curvature and matter is crushed to infinite density under the pull of infinite gravity. At a singularity, space and time cease to exist as we know them and current laws of physics cannot be applied to this region.\nSingularities form by a collapse of a star, where star with high enough mass (above 30 times the sun) would shrink under its own gravity and force until it becomes a single, one dimensional point. When it forms, space and time would be infinite in there. \nAn example would be that if a person were to stand on a collapsing star right before the singularity forms, and they sent a signal every second to a nearby observer, time and space would slow down as the singularity is being formed. The observer would hear the signal slowing down. Let's say the singularity forms at 12:00 exactly. The observer would receive all the signals, one after another, with each new signal slowing down at a very small rate until the 12:00 signal. When the 12:00 signal was sent, time and space would be infinite -- in other words, it would take forever to get the signal.\nTo understand singularities, you have to think about infinite density, like how the original Big Bang started. The Big Bang, most scientists believe, started from an earlier universe that was pulled together by gravity into a single point. After that, it exploded and made all the matter in the expanding universe. A black hole singularity is similar, except on a smaller scale. Imagine if our sun decreased to the size of the nucleus of an atom. It would be very dense. However, our sun does not have a high enough mass to become a black hole. It is well below the Chandrasekhar limit, which means it will shrink to a white dwarf, with radius of a few thousand miles. It can't become a black hole, because it is too small."}

Scientists are confident that almost all galaxies, including the Milky Way, have supermassive black holes at their centers.\nFormation.\nHow supermassive black holes get started is not yet known. Astrophysicists agree that once a black hole is in place in the center of a galaxy, it can grow by attracting matter and by merging with other black holes. Formation of ordinary (star-sized) black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and supported by observations.\nHowever, there appears to be a gap between stellar-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes.\nStellar-mass black holes, formed from collapsing stars, range up to perhaps 33 solar masses. The minimal supermassive black hole is in the range of a hundred thousand solar masses. Between these extremes there appear to be few intermediate-mass black holes. Such a gap would suggest that the two types were formed by different processes.\nObservations show that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger. Supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.\nThe Milky Way SBH.\nAstronomers are confident that our own Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. It is 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. The region is called Sagittarius A*, and the evidence for its being a black hole is:\nThe Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and the UCLA Galactic Center Group, have provided strong evidence that Sagittarius A* is the site of a supermassive black hole. This is based on data from the ESO, and the Keck telescope. Our galactic central black hole is calculated to have a mass of approximately 4.1 million solar masses, or about 8.2 \u00d7 1036 kg."}

Imagine the black hole to be like a ball that you could see in a large spot of emptiness. The event horizon would then be an outer bubble that surrounds that ball, the space between the ball and the larger bubble would be the event horizon. If an object goes past the event horizon, it can never get away from it. Light that is emitted from inside of the event horizon near the black hole can never reach an observer on the other side. If an observer saw an object fall into a black hole, it would look like the object was stuck at the event horizon forever. The reason this happens is because of the gravity of the black hole slows down time around it, making it look like the object will take an infinite amount of time to reach it."}

They grow from a central rosette. It also produces branched stolons with small white flowers and baby plantlets.\nIt is a very popular houseplant. The most widely grown is the variegated cultivar 'Variegatum'. It has one or two broad yellowish-white bands running along the length of each leaf. Natural, entirely green plants are also grown. \nThe Spider Plant is very easy to spread. They can be propagated by splitting its main rosette. It is even easier to remove plantlets from the stolons and plant them separately or put them in a glass of water. They will grow roots readily in water but establish faster in soil while still attached to the parent plant. Pinning the plantlet to the soil with a bent paper clip can be helpful. Make sure the soil is damp and well drained. The plantlet can then be removed from the parent plant in 7-10 days.\nIt is a very popular plant with beginners, as it is easy to grow and propagate.\nSpider plants have also been shown to reduce indoor air pollution.\nAt the spot where a leaf would normally develop a node, these plants will produce adventitious roots down into the soil, and new above ground shoots."}

Though Charles's wife Catherine of Braganza was barren, he stayed with her but had numerous mistresses. Some of Charles's illegitimate children were born before his marriage. This article deals with the most senior figures who were descended from Charles' illegitimate male children; the names of his daughters are also mentioned.\nAlthough some of Charles' children made claims to the throne, most notably his first son James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, their illegitimacy meant that after Charles' death, his brother James, Duke of York became king instead. Over the years several of Charles' senior descendants have made names for themselves, including Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton who became Prime Minister of Great Britain, cricket pioneer Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, parliamentary reformer Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond.\nDiana, Princess of Wales was descended from two of Charles' illegitimate sons; Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond. This means should her son Prince William, Duke of Cambridge take to the British throne as he is expected to, William would become the first blood descendant of Charles II to do so. Though William is part of the royal House of Windsor, rather than the House of Stuart.\nChildren by Catherine Pegge.\nCatherine Pegge and Charles II also had a daughter together called Catherine FitzCharles but she died young or became a nun.\nChildren by Barbara Villiers Palmer.\nBarbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland was perhaps the most notorious of Charles' mistresses. Some of the children claimed by Palmer as belonging to Charles are in doubt. Anne Lennard, Countess of Sussex was claimed to be Charles' and he recognised her, though some sources regard Roger Palmer as her father. Palmer claimed Lady Barbara FitzRoy was Charles' daughter, however he never recognised her and most sources consider John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough her likely father. Palmer and Charles had a daughter together Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield and three sons who were recognised by Charles, their lines are featured below.\nChild by Moll Davis.\nThe two had one daughter; Lady Mary Tudor. Mary went on to marry Edward Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Derwentwater; after Edward's death, she married Henry Graham, and upon his death she married James Rooke."}

In 839 he succeeded his father as King of Wessex.\nEarly career.\nAthelwulf was born . He was the oldest son of King Egbert of Wessex and his Frankish wife Redburga. He may have been born in Francia (France) while his father was in exile there. In 824 his father sent him at the head of an army into Kent. There Athelwulf drove Baldred, the Mercian puppet king, out of Kent. His father appointed Athelwulf King of Kent which included Essex, Surrey and Sussex. Athelwulf ruled as a sub-king of Wessex.\nKing of Wessex.\nAthelwulf succeeded his father to the throne of Wessex in 839. His father Egbert had done everything he could so that his son would be king after him. He appointed Aethelwulf his sub-king; ruler of the subordinate kingdom of Kent. This gave Athelwulf experience that made him the leading candidate for king after his father. In turn, Athelwulf did the same for his sons to insure they would follow him to the throne. One of the first things he did as king was to appoint his son Athelstan, King of Kent.\nUnder Athelwulf's rule the ealdormen, the most important leaders after the king, became very important. In the 840s when viking raids became more frequent it was his ealdormen who led various local armies against the invaders. In 851 there were three large raids in southern England. The largest had over three hundred ships. They attacked at a place called Acleah in Surrey. Athelwolf and his son Athelbald met the Danes (vikings) in battle and defeated them. After this victory Athelwulf was considered the leading Anglo-Saxon king in England. In 852 Burghred of Mercia, a vassal king, asked for Athelwulf's help against Wales. Athelwulf did help and together they defeated Cyngen ap Cadell. Shortly afterward his daughter, Athelswith, became Burgred's wife and queen. By early 854 Athelwulf's wife, Osburgh, died. His eldest son Athelstan died about this same time.\nIn 855 Athelwulf went on a to Rome. He took his youngest son Alfred with him. He left the kingdom in the care of Athelbald, his second son. After spending a year in Rome he traveled to the court of Charles the Bald, King of the West Franks. There he spent the summer and fall of 856. In October 856 he wed the king's young daughter, Judith. She could not have been any older than thirteen at the time. The marriage was at best a diplomatic alliance. Both men were suffering from Viking attacks, and formed a common alliance. Charles insisted that his daughter be queen. When Athelwulf returned to Wessex there was opposition to his remaining king. To avoid a civil war he agreed to take the sub-kingship of Kent, held by Ethelbald. He let Ethelbald become king of Wessex. Athelwulf died in 858 as the King of Kent.

During his reign Viking attacks grew more frequent. One Viking army advanced into Wessex as far as Winchester before being defeated. But the year 865 saw the arrival of the Great Heathen Army in East Anglia. This was a much larger army and would remain in England. For a time they were more interested in Northumbria.

Convicts who were well-behaved were given a ticket of leave. This gave them some rights, and they did not have to stay in gaol. With a ticket of leave, a convict was able to look for work in a particular area but could not leave the area without permission from a court. Every change of employer or district was written on the ticket.\nHistory.\nGovernor Philip Gidley King started the tickets of leave in 1801. It gave prisoners a reason to behave themselves. Also, it helped to provide cheap workers for farmers who were settling in Australia. The government saved money as it did not have to feed and clothe the prisoners.\nThose with a ticket of leave were able to marry or to bring their families from Britain. They could buy land but not carry guns or get onto a ship. They were often made to pay back the cost of their travel in the prison ship to Australia. The ticket of leave had to be renewed every year, and those with one had to attend (where it could be checked they were still living in the area), and church services. Prisoners could lose their ticket and be sent back to prison if they were lazy, if they tried to get paid too much, or if they were rude to the police or soldiers. Sometimes, prisoners who helped the government, by capturing escaped convicts for example, might be given a ticket of leave as a reward.\nA convict who kept to the conditions of his ticket of leave was given a conditional pardon after half of the time he was supposed to be in gaol. Then, they were no longer a convict and could do everything except leave the colony. Convicts who did not keep to the conditions of their ticket could be arrested without warning, go to court without being able to appeal, and lose all their property.\nThe ticket.\nThe ticket itself was a highly detailed document. It listed the convicts' number, the name, the ship in which sent to Australia, the year that they arrived, the captain of the ship, where they came from, their job, the crimes,the place and date of trial, the sentence, the birth date, what they looked like, the area the prisoner was allowed to live in, the court that gave out the ticket, the date the ticket was given, any other conditions of the ticket, and any changes of where they lived. A lot of this information has been kept, which makes them a very important source of information for people looking at family history."}

Patients typically complain of sharp anal pain during and after defecation, lasting minuters or hours. This small wound can sometimes bleed a little bit during or after defecation.\nIt's not completely clear what causes an anal fissure. It is possibly caused by constipation, too much strain on the anal sphincter (the circular muscle of the anus), reduced blood circulation, the skin is not made dry enough after taking a shower or swimming, the skin has been stretched too much, pregnancy, giving birth, and not changing a baby's diaper in time. \nAfter the anal fissure closes, it takes 6 weeks to 3 months before the wound is healed completely. In this period the fissure easily opens again. Therefore, the wound can return repeatedly.\nTreatment.\nA doctor can prescribe several products to treat the anal fissure. For example, a pain relieving ointment or suppository (an anal medication); a laxative (that makes it easier to go to the toilet); zinc-ointment (this will protect the skin and contract it, so it will heal faster). Further more a doctor can give advice about taking care of the wound and improve digestion and defecation.\nMost fissure are acute, lasting about 4-6 weeks. The anal fissure becomes chronic and will not go away if it lasts for more than 6 weeks. In such cases medical surgery can be a solution. The circular muscle of the anus is usually cut or stretched. Also an injection with botox in the muscle can have a positive result.\nTo prevent the fissure to return.\nThe anal fissure can burst open very easily up to 3 months after healing, for example during defecation. The patient can do several things to reduce the chance that the fissure will return. The advice includes the following tips.\nAs long as the fissure is open (a painful, small tear next to the anus which can bleed a little) the patient can put an ointment with zinc oxide (protects and contracts) and pramoca\u00efne (relieves pain and itching) on and around the fissure (in Europe available without prescription as \"Nestosyl\"). Use toilet your finger with a glove to spread out the ointment and wash hands afterward with soap. This treatment has to be continued for several weeks to reduce the chance that the fissure will open again.\nBesides it is very important to have a good digestion and defecation. The longer the faeces is in the intestine, the more liquid will be withdrawal. Because of this, the faeces will become harder and get more volume, and that gives more chance that the skin around the anus will crack again. Patients are advized to eat fibres every day (for example: unpolished rice, muesli, whole grain bread, dried apricots, figs, dates, prunes, saltless nuts, beans, peas, etc.); to eat the recommended amount of vegetables and fruit every day; to use a little bit of butter or oil every day; to drink enough during the day; and to exercise every day. The patient needs to avoid food that can cause constipation (possible: white bread, white pasta/pizza/noodles, eggs, cheese, sugar, coffee, chocolate, etc.). If necessary, one can take enzymes as food supplement with every meal that includes bread.\nPatients should not postpone going to the toilet. While waiting, the faeces will push on the circular muscle of the anus, which causes a pressure. Besides the faeces can become harder and get more volume after a while. When the patient feels the urge to go to the toilet, the best thing is to go immediately. While sitting on the toilet, the patient has to press as little as possible, but instead relax the circular muscle.\nAs long as the wound is not healed, taking a daily bath with soda (sodium carbonate) can give relief. Further more that will keep the wound clean. Sit in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water for 20 minutes, 2 or 3 times a day. This is called a sitz bath. It relaxes the tissue and helps relax the anal muscle.\nIt's very important that the skin around the anus is completely dry before the patients gets dressed. The slightest moisture in the folding of the skin can be the reason that the skin will get damaged easily.\nSome patients benefit by putting simple oil around the anus. For example, olive oil or sunflower oil. The skin softens and will not tear or crack as easily. Always remind hygiene.\nIf the tips that are mentioned above do not help enough and the fissure continues to crack open, the cause could be the use of toilet paper after defecation. The paper rubs too strong over the skin and causes the wound to open again. One can try to use another brand of softer toilet paper, baby wipes, or instead use warm water to clean himself after bowel movement. \nWhile following all mentioned tips and advice, do not forget the good principles of hygiene.\nThese recommendations only make sense if the patient is sure that the problem is an anal fissure. If there is any doubt, especially when there is blood in the stool, please consult a doctor"}

It shows that light has both a wave nature or characteristic and a particle nature or characteristic, and that these natures are inseparable. So, light is said to have wave\u2013particle duality rather than be only a wave or only a particle. The same is true for electrons and other quantum particles.\nThe experiment.\nThe base version of this experiment is very simple. It requires only a double slit device like the one in the picture, something to hold the double slit device still, and a good laser such as the kind that is used by workmen to \"draw\" straight lines when they are building. The laser is supported so it can only be moved on purpose. It is aimed at the central point between the two slits from a point about one half meter away. Something like a movie screen or a smooth white wall is put up on the other side of the double slit device several meters away. When everything is fixed, a pattern of light and dark bands will show up.\nLasers can produce one or more photons when given a certain amount of electricity. The photon or photons come out of a very small hole within a well known period of time. The speed of light is known, so the time the photons appear on the screen can be predicted. When photons are produced one at a time, what shows up on the screen are individual spots of light. If photons were waves then we would expect them to spread out as they travel and wash across a wide area of the screen, but that never happens. If photons were particles then we would expect them to appear at two points on the screen connected to the laser through the two slits in the middle. But that is not what happens either.\nWhen Thomas Young did this experiment, he had no laser. He understood it by imagining light to be like waves of water. He thought that light waves moved out from the light source like waves spreading out from a pebble dropped into a pond, and that when the wave fronts hit the double slits, then the original wave gets through at the two slits and there are two different waves from then on. It was easy to figure out how two waves would interact to produce the bright bands and dark bands (often called \"fringes\") on the screen. He said he had proven the theory that light is waves.\nBut there were big problems. Light did not show up at the screen as waves that washed across it. Light came to be understood as swarms of photons that individually hit the detection screen. And, very surprisingly, a single photon could interfere with itself as though it were a single wave that fit the old wave description. It split into two waves at the double-slit device, and they then combined at the screen.\nImportance to physics.\nThe double-slit experiment became a classic thought experiment for its clear explanation of the central puzzles of quantum mechanics.\nImportance to philosophy.\nThe double-slit experiment has been of great interest to philosophers, because the quantum mechanical behavior it shows has forced them to rethink their ideas about classical concepts such as:\nExperience in the micro world of sub-atomic particles forces us to re-conceptualise some of our most ordinary ideas.

Viruses, worms or trojan horses can be used by criminals or mischievous people (called 'hackers'). They can be used to steal information or damage system files. If no antivirus software is installed on a computer, hackers may be able to access the information in the computer.\nTypes.\nThere are many different types of antivirus software, and many antivirus programs can be downloaded for free. These free versions usually have some features missing, and the missing features are only available to those who buy the \nfull version. Even still, many free antiviruses today have excellent virus scanning capabilities and can give people suitable internet security protections without the need to purchase additional protections.\nFeatures.\nAntivirus software protects computers in many different ways. For starters, most antiviruses offer more than just \"virus\" protection. They protect computers from all different kinds of malware, like spyware, rootkits, phishing, and ransomware. For this reason, antiviruses are frequently interchangeably referred to as \"anti-malware\" programs. There are a few different ways that antiviruses protect against malware, but the most common way is through a regular scan of all the data and files on a computer's hard disk. In an antivirus scan, the software will look through every file on a computer, and it will compare each computer file's genetic makeup with the genetic makeup of already-known viruses. If a file has the same genetic makeup as a known piece of malware, it will be flagged as a problem. This is known as signature-based detection, and it is only effective when a malware file has been previously identified and shared with the community of malware researchers who maintain the malware database. Another typical kind of malware detection is through behavior analysis. This is when the antivirus software identifies an abnormal behavior in a computer file or program, causing the antivirus to flag that issue and assess whether or not the abnormality has been caused by malware or by something else.\nProblems with antivirus software.\nMost tests and experts claim that while antivirus software is extremely useful in preventing some cyber attacks, it is unable to prevent all attacks. That's because once a piece of malware has been identified, hackers know that this malware will be added to the list of already-known viruses, and it will no longer be able to pass through most signature-based detection systems. Also, antivirus software is not perfect, and there are constantly new and emerging threats that frequently bypass a computer's defenses.\nInstalling more than one antivirus is not a good idea. The two different antivirus software may interfere with each other and causes conflict.\nSometimes antivirus software sees viruses in files that do not really have viruses. This is called a false positive. The antivirus software will sometimes remove files from the computer that should not be removed. This may cause other programs to not work properly. \nReferences.\n5.https://techrisings.blogspot.com/2020/11/SAntivirus%20removal.html"}

His father was an organist and organ builder, and gave young Alexandre lessons. Otherwise Alexandre was largely self-taught. He did study with Belgian teacher Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, but by that time he was already a very good organist. From the 1860s he travelled widely in Europe, playing organs and becoming famous. Later he also visited the United States. In 1871 he became organist of the Trinit\u00e9 church in Paris. He kept this job until 1901.\nHis teaching.\nGuilmant became well known in France as a teacher. Together with two other musicians, Charles Bordes and Vincent d\u2019Indy, he started the Schola Cantorum, a private college where students could study music. He taught the organ there. Earlier he had succeeded Charles-Marie Widor as organ teacher at the Paris Conservatoire. His Conservatoire pupils included Joseph Bonnet, Nadia Boulanger and Marcel Dupr\u00e9.\nInfluence as organist.\nGuilmant did not just play the organ for church services. He became very famous for giving organ recitals. Often he played on organs which had been constructed by the brilliant organ builder Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll. He helped to make these organs popular in France, and they were a very important influence on the way that organists composed music for their instrument.\nBoth Guilmant and Widor produced large works for the organ which they called \u201csymphonies\u201d. These usually had at least four movements each, and gave the player opportunities to use many different sound effects.\nHis compositions.\nGuilmant wrote eight organ symphonies, as well as a symphony for organ and orchestra, and several shorter works for the same combination. He composed a great many miniatures, not just for organ but also for harmonium. This was useful for musicians in smaller churches which had a harmonium instead of a big organ. He wrote a book on how to play the organ, and for many years he edited collections of organ music which had been written by earlier composers.\nReferences.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians, ed.

The battle took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War. Gettysburg is often called the war's turning point. Union Major General George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac stopped attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This ended Lee's second invasion of the North. Lee began to move his men back to Virginia on July 4. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle.\nThe Siege of Vicksburg ended on the same day, also a Union victory.\nThat November, a cemetery for those who died there was opened at the Gettysburg National Cemetery. President Abraham Lincoln gave a speech called the Gettysburg Address at the ceremony to open the cemetery and honor the dead soldiers on both sides.\nBackground.\nLee's army won an important battle at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863. Afterwards, he led his army north through the Shenandoah Valley. His plan was to start his second invasion of the North (called the Gettysburg Campaign). Lee had several objectives in mind. He intended to take Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital. This, he hoped, would embarrass the Lincoln administration and force Northern politicians to give up the war. At this point, Lee was playing politics. He knew that if he was successful in Pennsylvania it would encourage the Northern peace movement. He hoped it would get foreign recognition for the Confederacy. It could also force the Union to negotiate for peace, allowing the Confederate states to become an independent country. Lee badly needed supplies and intended to get them in Pennsylvania. In addition to being the state capital, Harrisburg was also the site of Camp Curtin, the largest training camp for Union soldiers. It was a major railroad center. More importantly it was a major supply depot and also a prisoner of war camp.\nIn the North, Lincoln told Major General Joseph Hooker to have the Union army follow Lee's army. But Hooker was very reluctant to go after the Confederates. Finally, Lincoln lost all confidence in him. On June 28, three days before the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln appointed General Meade to replace Hooker. Had the Confederacy won, confederate force would have had access to Philadelphia or Baltimore. Vice President Hannibal Hamlin went to Lincoln to discuss a prisoner of war trade five days before the Battle of Gettysburg.\nJuly 1.\nNeither Lee nor Meade intended a battle take place at Gettysburg and neither were there when the battle started. On June 30, 1863, Confederate General Henry Heth had a division at Cashtown, Pennsylvania, Lee's gathering place before moving on to Harrisburg. Heth sent his division to nearby Gettysburg to look for, as he later wrote in his report, \"army supplies (shoes especially), and return the same day.\" This started the myth that the Battle of Gettysburg started over shoes. Heth did this without scouting ahead to see what was at Gettysburg. The job of scouting belonged to the Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart. But they had been gone for over a week. So, blind to what was ahead of them, his soldiers ran directly into a Union cavalry division commanded by General John Buford. This started the fighting even though Heth and other commanders were under orders from Lee not to start a battle. But, as each side brought in more troops, it became a full-scale battle. Lee started moving much of his army there. One of his goals was to fight the Union army and destroy it. Now, he would have to do it at Gettysburg.\nAbout 5.30\u00a0a.m. on the morning of July 1, the battle started. Heth probed ahead cautiously to a point about two miles west of Gettysburg. Buford's cavalry was deliberately slowing his progress. At about 10\u00a0a.m. the Union I Corps arrived commanded by General John F. Reynolds. They set themselves up along McPherson's Ridge to oppose Heth's Confederates. During the fighting Reynolds was killed but the Confederates were driven back. Meanwhile, both sides brought up reinforcements. The Union set up defenses of the town with I Corps defending the western approaches with XI Corps to the north. The flanks were covered by Buford's cavalry. One Union division was held in reserve on Cemetery Ridge. In the afternoon, when Lee arrived, the Confederates still did not know the strength of the Union forces they were facing. They also had not scouted the terrain. One division of Ewell's Corps had attacked the Union I Corps just after noon. At about 2\u00a0p.m. Heth's division joined Ewell's troops in the attack on I Corps. At about 3\u00a0p.m., another of Ewell's Confederate divisions, commanded by General Jubal Early, attacked the flank of the Union XI Corps. By 4\u00a0p.m., both of the Union corps retreated through Gettysburg and took up positions on Cemetery Ridge. So far, the Union had lost about 9,000 men including about 3,000 who had been captured. The Confederates had lost about 6,500 men by this point. So the first day of battle was technically a Confederate victory numbers-wise. But Federal troops held the high ground as more reinforcements were still arriving. Based on the first day's fighting, Lee was convinced he could defeat Meade at Gettysburg.\nLate in the day, Lee sent the famous order to Confederate General Richard S. Ewell to take cemetery ridge \"if practicable.\u201d While he had been awaiting orders from Lee, Ewell had ridden out to take a closer look at Cemetery Ridge. Based on what he saw and the confusing order, he decided it was not practicable to take the hill and set up camp. Instead, he decided to leave the assault for the next day. This was the first major mistake of the battle for the South. The Army of the Potomac would end the day with around 21,900 men strongly positioned on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Ridge. The Army of Northern Virginia would have around 27,000 men from Benner's Hill to Seminary Ridge.\nJuly 2.\nOn the second day of battle, most of both armies had arrived. The Union line held the high ground in a defensive formation that looked like a fishhook. On July 2, Lee ordered General James Longstreet, commander of the Confederate I Corps, to attack the Union left flank as early in the day as possible. At the same time General A. P. Hill's corps was to attack the Union center. General Ewell was to make diversionary attacks and \"if practicable\" attack the Union Army's right flank. Lee felt that if everything went according to his plan and the Union line was destroyed, the battle, and possibly the war, would be won on the second day. Lee's coordinated attack required getting all the infantry into position and moving up artillery to support them. Longstreet had the furthest to go and midway in their march realized the Union lines could see them. They went back and had to take a different route. Longstreet could not get his corps into position until about 4\u00a0p.m. when he began his attack. His attack on the Union line lasted for over three hours but could not break the Union line. Hill's Corps failed to be effective in the center. Ewell did not attack Cemetery Ridge as instructed in Lee's confusing order, but made some progress in taking Culp's Hill.\nUnion Major General Daniel Sickles, a political general commanding III Corps, disobeyed Meade's orders and moved his troops forward to the Peach Orchard. He had been ordered to take up a position on Little Round Top connecting with Union forces on both his right and left. By doing this he left a large hole in the Union line. He marched to a position nearly in front of the Union line with no support on either side. Within an hour, his entire III Corps was nearly wiped out by Longstreet. Sickles was badly wounded by a cannonball and lost a leg. Being wounded was all that saved him from a court-martial. Sickles' blunder nearly lost the entire battle for the Union.\nOn the night of July 2, Longstreet's largest division commanded by General George Pickett arrived and was placed in the center of the Confederate line. Lee's plan for the next day was to attack on both the Union right and left, just as he had done the day before. Lee was still certain he could break the Union line and win the battle. That day Stuart's cavalry had caught up with Lee's army and Lee ordered Stuart to ride around the East side of Gettysburg and attack the Union rear. Ewell had also been reinforced and was ordered to take Culp's Hill the next morning.\nMeade ordered the Union XII Corps to drive Ewell's forces off the captured trenches on Culp's Hill. They were to move at daylight the next morning. He was determined the remainder of the Union Army would hold its position and wait for Lee to attack.\nJuly 3.\nEwell began fighting on Culp's Hill at first light. Lee rode to Longstreet's headquarters only to find Longstreet had misunderstood his orders. He was planning a turning movement against the Union left. Now, with no hope of a coordinated attack, Lee changed the plan. Longstreet was to attack the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. Ewell's forces failed in their counterattacks and were forced to withdraw from Culp's Hill by about 11:00\u00a0a.m. Lee pinned all his hopes on Longstreet's attack on the center. Longstreet had the last fresh division in Lee's army. It was made up of three brigades, commanded by generals James L. Kemper, Richard B. Garnett, and Lewis A. Armistead, led by Pickett.\nCannons.\nFirst, a bombardment by about 140 Confederate cannons on the Union lines was ordered. The bombardment started about 1\u00a0p.m. About 80 Union cannons returned fire. The cannons duel lasted for between one and two hours, depending on the source (most say about an hour). The Confederate artillery chief, General Edward Porter Alexander, had only intended it to last for about 25\u00a0minutes. But he then realized it had done little damage to the Union line so he continued. But he also had to worry about running out of ammunition and not have enough to support the charge that was Pickett was about to make. When the Union guns fell silent, Porter thought he had knocked them out. But it was a trick by the Union artillery chief. His guns were waiting for the charge the Union forces knew was coming. Alexander sent word to Pickett he could start his attack.\nThe cannonade could be heard as far away as Philadelphia. The noise was so loud the gunner's ears bled. It was probably the loudest noise that had ever been heard on the North American continent up to that time. In the end the Confederate cannons may have killed as many as 200 Union soldiers in the area that would later become known as the \"bloody angle\". But the Union guns may have killed more Confederate troops.\nPickett's Charge.\nCalling the Confederate attack on the Union center \"Pickett's Charge\" is misleading for two reasons. First, Pickett commanded only one of the three units in the assault. Second, it was not a charge, which is a rapid advance towards the enemy, it was an attack which moved forward more slowly and over a longer distance. These Virginia units were joined by several smaller units of Confederates (some from North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama) whose numbers had been reduced by the fighting over the first two days. When the cannons stopped, Pickett went to Longstreet to ask permission to begin the attack. Longstreet, sure the attack would fail, silently nodded his head and gave a wave of his hand. Longstreet had tried to get Lee to call off the attack, but Lee would not listen.\nOver 12,000 Confederates stepped out from the trees and formed up for the long march forward. Waiting for them behind a low stone fence on Cemetery Ridge were about 5,000 Union troops, most of whom belonged to General Winfield Scott Hancock's II Corps. Depending on the source, this was between 2:00 and 3:00\u00a0p.m. As they marched forward across the distance, Union artillery killed large numbers of troops. Rifle fire from the Union line was intense. The Union troops used four lines of soldiers. As the line in front fired, they moved back to reload while the next line moved up to fire. Only a few hundred of the Virginians reached the Union line. Within minutes they were dead or dying. Some were captured. The attack lasted about an hour with over 7,000 Confederate soldiers killed. As the remaining Confederate troops retreated, Lee was seen riding his horse saying \"this was all my fault\". He then told Pickett to rally his division. Pickett famously replied, \"General, I have no division.\"\nAt about the same time as the main attack, Stuart's cavalry attacked the Union rear but the attack also failed.\nAftermath.\nLee brought an army into Pennsylvania that numbered 75,054 men and lost 22,638 casualties or about 30% of his army. Meade lost so many field grade officers that the Army of the Potomac would not recover for the rest of the war. Both the Union I Corps and III Corps lost so many men they had to be combined with II Corps. The battle took more American lives than any other battle in United States history. Gettysburg is still the largest battle to ever be fought on American soil. The Union victory over the Confederacy ended Lee's invasion of the north. Lee would never try to invade the Union again. The Army of Northern Virginia would never get their strength back. However the supplies taken during their time in Pennsylvania would keep the Confederate army going. The wagon train of supply wagons and ambulances for the wounded was over long. Lee never had more than 51,000 men the rest of the war. Numbers from the Union forces wore down Lee and his army. This is why Gettysburg is said to be the turning point of the American Civil War. After the battle the confederates figured out that there was a slave spy.\nMeade was severely criticized for not counterattacking Lee after the third day of battle. The next day Meade sent out skirmishers, but did not attack. Lee had his army hold its position on Seminary Ridge all day on July 4. The more than 10,000 wounded men would be moved by wagon train to Williamsport and cross the Potomac to Virginia. The rest of Lee's army followed on the night of July 4\u20135, screened by Jeb Stuart's cavalry. The next day, on discovering the Confederates had left the battlefield, the Union army cautiously followed.

They are made by certain types of stars later in their life. They look like planets through small optical telescopes. They do not last for long compared to a star, only tens of thousands of years.\nAt the end of a normal-sized star's life, in the red giant phase, the outside layers of a star are ejected. Because the outside is gone, the star shines brightly and is very hot. The ultraviolet radiation given off by the center of the star ionizes the gas and plasma that was thrown out from the star. This is what causes a planetary nebula to look like it does.\nWhile some planetary nebulae look similar, others have very distinct and unique shapes. Scientists are not sure why planetary nebulae can look so different from one another. Scientists think that binary stars, stellar winds and magnetic fields might be some of the reasons planetary nebulae can look so varied. In the early 21st century some astronomers began calling them \u201cglobular nebulas\u201d to avoid confusing them with the Protoplanetary nebulas that make planets.\nObservations.\nPlanetary nebula are not very bright. None of them are bright enough to see without a telescope. The first one discovered was the Dumbbell nebula. \nAstronomers did not know what these objects were until the first spectroscopic experiments were done in the 1800's. William Huggins used a prism to look at galaxies. He noticed that they looked a lot like stars.\nWhen he looked at the Cat's Eye nebula, it did not look the same. He saw an emission line at a place that no one had seen before. This meant that it looked like an element that no one had ever seen before. Scientists thought it might be a new element. They decided to call it \"nebulium\".\nLater, physicists showed that it is possible for gasses with a very low density to look like something else. It turned out that the gas they were looking at was oxygen, and not nebulium.\nThe stars in planetary nebulae are very hot. They are not very bright, though. This means that they must be very small. The only time that stars get that small is when they are dying. That means that they are one of the last steps in a star's death. Astronomers saw that all planetary nebula are expanding. This meant that they were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.\nOrigins.\nStars weighing more than eight solar masses will become supernovae. Stars of lesser mass will form planetary nebulae. After billions of years of stellar evolution a star will have no more hydrogen. This makes the surface of the star colder, and makes the core smaller. The sun's core is about 15 million degrees Kelvin. When it runs out of hydrogen, the smaller core will cause it to rise to about 100 million degrees Kelvin.\nThe outer layers of the star become much bigger because of the heat of the core, and become much cooler. The star becomes a red giant. The core gets even smaller and hotter. When its reaches 100 million K, helium begins to fuse into carbon and oxygen. When this happens, the core stops shrinking. Helium burning soon forms a core of carbon and oxygen, with both a helium and a hydrogen shell surrounding it.\nBecause helium in fusion reactions is not very stable, the core starts to grow and shrink very quickly. Strong stellar winds blow the gas and plasma in the outer layer of the star outwards. These gases form a cloud around the core of the star. As more and more of the gas moves away from the star, deeper and deeper layers at higher and higher temperatures are sent out. When the gas heats up to around 30,000 degrees kelvin, the gas starts to glow. The cloud has then become a planetary nebula.\nNumbers and position.\nWe know of about 3,000 of these nebulae in our galaxy, compared to 200 billion stars. Their very short lifetime compared to a star is why there are not that many compared to stars. They are found mostly in the plane of the Milky Way, and there are more and more the closer you get to the center of the Milky Way.\nShape.\nOnly about twenty percent of planetary nebulae are spheres (like Abell 39). The rest of them have various shapes. The reason for these shapes is not understood. It may be because of the gravitational pull of secondary stars (for example, if it is a binary star system). A second theory is that planets near the star might change how the nebula forms. A third theory is that magnetic fields cause the shapes. .\nProblems.\nA problem in studying planetary nebulae is that astronomers can not always work out how far away they are. When they are close, astronomers use something called \"expansion parallax\" to estimate how far away they are, but this takes a long time. If they are not close, there is not yet a good way to find how distant they are."}

The glowing is caused by a star being near the nebula. There are many types of emission nebula. H II regions are caused when stars are forming and are very hot, causing the plasma to heat up. Planetary nebulae are made when where a dying star has thrown off its outer layers. This causes the core of the star to heat up the plasma.\nGeneral information.\nA nebula's color depends on what chemicals are in it, and how ionized it is. Because most of the universe is made of hydrogen, many emission nebulae appear red. Hydrogen glows red when it is hot. If the nebula is very hot, other types of gas will be heated and the it might also glow blue and green. By looking at which colors are glowing in a nebula, one can figure out what it is made of.\nEmission nebulae sometimes look like they have dark areas in them. This is because clouds of dust block the light when it is traveling between the nebula and the Earth. "}

A good example of this is the Orion nebula.\nReflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation."}

Hot solid objects produce light with a continuous spectrum, and hot gasses emit light at specific wavelengths. However, hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gasses show a near-continuous spectrum with \"dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gasses\". By comparing the absorption lines of the\nSun with emission spectra of known gasses, the chemical composition of stars can be discovered."}

A Feynman diagram has \"lines\" in different shapes\u2014straight, dotted, and squiggly\u2014which meet up at points called \"vertices\". The vertices are where the lines begin and end. The points in Feynman diagrams where the lines meet represent two or more particles that happen to be at the same point in space at the same time. The \"lines\" in a Feynman diagram represent the probability amplitude for a particle to go from one place to another.\nIn Feynman diagrams, the particles are allowed to go both forward and backward in time. When a particle is going backward in time, it is called an antiparticle. The meeting points for the lines can also be interpreted forward or backwards in time, so that if a particle disappears into a meeting point, that means that the particle was either created or destroyed, depending on the direction in time that the particle came in from.\nAll the lines and vertices have an amplitude. When you multiply the probability amplitude for the lines, the amplitude for the particles to go from wherever they start to wherever they meet, and to the next meeting point, and so on, and also multiply by the amplitude for each meeting point, you get a number that tells you the total amplitude for the particles to do what the diagram says they do. If you add up all these probability amplitudes over all the possible meeting points, and over all the starting and ending points with an appropriate weight, you get the total probability amplitude for a collision in a particle accelerator, which tells you the total probability of these particles to bounce off one another in any particular direction.\nFeynman diagrams are named after Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics. His diagrams are very simple in the case of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where there are only two kinds of particles: electrons (little particles inside atoms) and photons (particles of light). In QED, the only thing that can happen is that an electron (or its antiparticle) can emit (or absorb) a photon, so there is only one building block for any collision. The probability amplitude for the emission is very simple\u2014it has no real part, and the imaginary part is the \"charge\" of the electron."}

They later became a different band called The Valentines. When the Valentines broke up in 1970, Scott joined a band called Fraternity. Fraternity left Australia and went to Europe, but came back soon after. Scott then joined a band called the Mount Lofty Rangers. In 1974 he had a motorcycle accident and was in hospital for a few months. After he left hospital he joined AC/DC.\nCareer.\nAC/DC's first two albums were \"High Voltage\" and \"T.N.T.\". They were only released in Australia. Their first worldwide album was released in 1976. It had songs from both \"High Voltage\" and \"T.N.T.\", and was also called \"High Voltage\". They released another album that year called \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\". Their next albums were \"Let There Be Rock\", \"Powerage\", and a live album called \"If You Want Blood You've Got It\". AC/DC's last album with Scott as their singer was \"Highway to Hell\".\nDeath.\nScott died of alcohol poisoning in London on 19 February 1980. He was 33 years old at the time. Brian Johnson became AC/DC's new lead singer. There is a bronze statue of Bon Scott in Fremantle. Shortly after his death, AC/DC released a tribute album to Scott, Back in Black."}

The image was taken in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995.\nIt is important because it shows some of the earliest (farthest away) galaxies ever seen, over 3000 in total.\nThe area of the sky the HDF was taken in makes up less than 1/10th the width of a full Moon, yet it contains over 3,000 galaxies.\nBecause of the time it takes for light from these galaxies to reach Earth, many in the picture look exactly as they did over 10 billion (10,000,000,000) years ago. Because of this it allows scientists to look at what the Universe was like at that time, and how it changed to become what it is now. Add to this the cosmological principle, which suggests that on large scales the Universe is roughly the same no matter what direction you look, and the HDF becomes a very important tool for astronomers studying how the Universe has changed.\nFor these reasons the HDF is sometimes called 'the most important image ever taken'."}

It was called \"Occidental\" between 1922 and 1947. Edgar de Wahl, one of the first Esperantists, created it. De Wahl was from the city of Tallinn in Estonia, which was in the Russian Empire but later became its own country. He spoke German, Russian, Estonian and French since he was a child and had natural ability in languages. He is often called \"de Wahl\".\nInterlingue looks a lot like languages in the Romance language family: French, Spanish, Italian, and so on. De Wahl made a rule called De Wahl's rule that made changing verbs to nouns easier and more regular. For example, the change of d in the word exploder (to explode) to s (making explosion and explosiv) is a regular change when following this rule.\nDe Wahl was not happy with Esperanto. He decided to create a language called \"Occidental\". He published it in 1922. In 1949 the users of Occidental voted to change the name to \"Interlingue\".\nThere were already many types of constructed languages during de Wahl's time. Some of them, like Esperanto and Ido, are called \"schematic\" because they follow their own design even if the words look more artificial. Others, like Latino sine flexione and Idiom Neutral, are called \"naturalistic\" because they try to look like natural languages. The difficulty was that creators had to choose between being regular or looking natural. Louis Couturat, the creator of Ido, wrote the same thing in 1903, and called it a paradox: \"The international words are not regular, and the regular words are not international.\" The language that de Wahl made had a goal to be a language that was both regular and natural at the same time.\nHistory.\nHow Occidental (Interlingue) started.\nDe Wahl announced his language in the magazine Kosmoglott in 1922, and this is where the Occidental activities can be seen. However, de Wahl started making the language long before this. Between 1906 and 1921 he started experimenting with his own language, and it changed a lot. At the time he called it Auli, or \"auxiliary language\" (auxiliary means helpful). The other nickname for Auli is proto-Occidental (which means \"old Occidental\"). When de Wahl announced his language in 1922, it was almost but not quite done. He actually wanted to wait a bit longer, but there was big news in 1921: the League of Nations was looking at the idea of an international language. De Wahl had also sent a letter and got a positive reply from the League of Nations in September 1921.\nPeople began using Occidental because it was easy to read and understand, even without grammars and dictionaries. \n\"Kosmoglott\" changed its name to \"Cosmoglotta\" in 1927 and began promoting Occidental over other languages. In January of the same year, they moved \"Cosmoglotta's\" office to Vienna in the region of Mauer (now part of Liesing). This helped Occidental have success during this period because the office was now in a central location. Engelbert Pigal, who is also from Austria, helped too with his article \"Li Ovre de Edgar de Wahl\" (The Work of Edgar de Wahl) which convinced some users of the Ido language to try Occidental. By early 1930, people were using Occidental in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and most recently in France.\nVienna period and World War II.\nWhen the magazine Cosmoglotta was based in Vienna, the users of the language had enough money for the first time. This was thanks to two people: Hans H\u00f6rbiger, also from Vienna, and G.A. Moore, from London. The world economy was not doing well at this time, but with the help of people like H\u00f6rbiger and Moore, \"Cosmoglotta\" was able to do well and gained readers. But H\u00f6rbiger and Moore both died in 1931, so this period did not last long. After this \"Cosmoglotta\" had to find money from other places: subscriptions, books, magazines, and so on.\nThe growing movement began a stronger campaign for the language in the early 1930s in which it promoted Occidental's easy understanding at first sight. They contacted organizations with letters completely in Occidental, and these organizations often understood the letters and sent responses. The Occidentalists also introduced the idea of Occidental being the answer to Europe's \"tower of Babel\".\nThe years 1935 to 1939 were even more active. This is when \"Cosmoglotta\" started publishing a second edition. The second edition first had the name \"Cosmoglotta-Informationes\", but was soon called \"Cosmoglotta B.\" Cosmoglotta B had more discussions that were interesting to the users of Occidental such as the language's development, Occidental in the news, and how much money they had.\nMeanwhile, the years before the World War II led to problems for Occidental and other planned languages because they were made illegal in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Their groups were forced to break up, the Gestapo watched their activities, and their educational materials were destroyed. Germany had the largest number of Occidentalists, so making planned languages illegal in Germany was especially damaging. \nWorld War Two suddenly started in 1939, and this stopped the publications of both Cosmoglottas until 1940. This was when Cosmoglotta was most active. One Cosmoglotta A or B was published every month between January 1937 and September 1939 when the war started. Then one edition was published every month from September 1941 to June 1951. During the Second World War, only Switzerland and Sweden were neutral countries. Because of this, only the Occidentalists in these countries could carry on their activities.\nDuring the war, telegrams were checked by censors before approving them to send. The Occidentalists noticed that their telegrams were being sent, especially between Switzerland and Sweden. This meant that the censors could probably understand it and maybe thought the language was Spanish or Romansch. With this, the Occidentalists in Switzerland and Sweden could communicate with each other a bit.\nThe other centres of Occidental activity in Europe did not continue. Contacts began again soon after the war by those who survived. Cosmoglotta had subscribers in 58 cities in Switzerland a few months before the end of World War II in Europe, and Cosmoglotta A started again in 1946.\nSetting up the language standard.\nOne of these activities was language standardization. De Wahl had created Occidental with some unchangeable features, but believed that it could follow a \"natural evolution\".\nOrthography was another area in which several possibilities existed: etymologic orthography (adtractiv, obpression), historic orthography (attractiv, oppression), or simplified orthography (atractiv, opression). Simplified orthography became the standard by 1939. Much of the standardization of the language took place in this way through community preference (e.g. both ac and anc were proposed for the word \"also\" but the community quickly settled on anc), but not all.\nAs there was a lack of general material destined for the general public, much time during World War II was spend creating courses and standardizing the language. In Augusut 1943, as the war was still going on, it was decided to create an academy to officialize the process. The Swiss Occidentalist, isolated from the rest of the continent, concentrated on developing educational materials. The standardization efforts were based on actual usage.\nIALA, Interlingua, and name change to Interlingue.\nThe International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), founded in 1924 to study and decide the best planned language for international communication, was at first viewed with disbelief by the Occidental community. Many of its members, including its co-founder Alice Vanderbilt Morris, were Esperantists. This made many Occidentalists including de Wahl himself believed that it had been set up as a pretext to give the impressoin of a \"neutral and professional\" committee that would finally choose Esperanto. Relations soon improved, however, as it became clear that the IALA intended to be as impartial as possible by familiarizing itself with all existing planned languages. \nIn 1945, the IALA announced that it planned to create its own language. It showed four possible versions under consideration. They were naturalistic as opposed to schematic. Some Occidentalists were happy that the IALA had decided to create a language almost the same as Occidental. They believed that it supported their argument for a naturalistic auxiliary language. \nThe two languages had somewhat different spellings (e.g. \"filosofie\" in Occidental and \"philosophia\" in Interlingua for 'philosophy'), but besides this both languages had 90% the same vocabulary. However, their structure and word creation systems were very different: \nAll of this happened in a time when Occidental, based in Europe, was still recovering from the war. Besides the economic difficulties that the movement was suffering (not like the well-funded IALA, which was based in New York), the beginning of the Cold War created a difficult situation for the Occidental-Union, which had the same name as an anti-Russian political league. In early 1948 the Czechoslovak Occidentalists had begun asking for the approval for a new name that would allow them to continue their linguistic activities without problems. The Union responded that they were free to introduce the language as \"Interlingue (Occidental)\", or even remove the mention of Occidental if they felt it necessary. Ric Berger began supporting a change of name from Occidental to Interlingue in 1948 which he also hoped would help in uniting it with Interlingua. With a 91% support in a ballot done by the Occidental Union in 1949, Interlingue was made the official name of the language, with Interlingue (Occidental) also permitted, valid as of 1 September 1949.\nInterlingue-Occidental suffered when Interlingua was announced in 1951. This was because now it had a competitor in the field of naturalistic planned auxiliary languages. In fact, Ric Berger, one of the most important Occidentalists, stopped supporting Interlingue to support IALA's project. He also tried to convince other Occidentalists to do the same.\nPause and revival.\nInterlingue was quite weakened after many users moved to Interlingua, though the drop in activity was gradual and happened over decades.\n\"Cosmoglotta B\" stopped publishing after 1950, and \"Cosmoglotta A\" was published less frequently. Other bulletins in Interlingue continued to appear during this time. Barandovsk\u00e1-Frank believed that the decrease of interest in Occidental-Interlingue happened at the same time as generation that was first drawn to it from other planned languages was getting older (translated from Esperanto):Most of those interested in Interlingue belonged to the generation that became familiar in turn with Volap\u00fck, Esperanto and Ido, later on finding the most aesthetic (basically naturalistic) solution in Occidental-Interlingue. After that, many moved to IALA's Interlingua, which however did not prove to be much more successful despite the impression its scientific origin made, and those who remained loyal to Occidental-Interlingue did not succeed in giving their excitement to a new generation.\nActivity in Interlingue eventually reached a low during the 1980s and early 1990s, when \"Cosmoglotta\" publication stopped for a some years. According to Harlow, \"in 1985 Occidental's last periodical, \"Cosmoglotta\", ceased publication, and its editor, Mr. Adrian Pilgrim, is quoted as having described Occidental as a 'dead language.'\" A decade later, a documentary film in 1994 by Steve Hawley and Steyger on planned languages introduced Interlingue speaker Donald Gasper as \"one of the last remaining speakers of the language Occidental\".\nThe arrival of the internet helped many other planned languages, and the same happened for Interlingue which came back to life. In the year 1999, the first Yahoo! Group in Occidental was founded. That same year, \"Cosmoglotta\" began publishing again from time to time. Also in 1999, the language started being discussed in literature on auxiliary languages. One example is \"The Esperanto Book\" published in 1995 by Harlow, who wrote that Occidental had an intentional emphasis on European forms and that some of its leading followers had an Eurocentric philosophy, which may have set back its spread. Still, the opposite view was also common in the community and Occidental gained supporters in many nations including Asian nations. An Interlingue Wikipedia was approved in 2004. In recent years official meetings between Interlingue speakers have begun taking place again: a meeting in Ulm on 10 January 2013, another in Munich in 2014 with three participants, and a third in Ulm on 16 August 2015 with five participants.\nGrammar.\nAlphabet and pronunciation.\nInterlingue is written with 26 Latin letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. The letters of the alphabet are pronounced as \"a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha, i, jot, ka, el, em, en, o, pe, qu, er, es, te, u, ve, duplic ve, ix, ypsilon\", and \"zet\". Accents are written on the five vowels to indicate irregular stress, with the acute accent (\u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa) preferred, but others (\u00e8, \u00ea, etc.) permitted.\nThe vowels are usually pronounced as follows:\nThe consonants are pronounced as in English, with the following exceptions:\nArticle.\nLike English, Interlingue has a definite article and an indefinite article. The definite article (the) is \"li\", and the indefinite (a, an) is \"un\". Plural of a noun is made by adding \"-s\" after a vowel, or \"-es\" after most consonants. To avoid pronunciation and stress changes, words ending in -c, -g, and -m only add an -s: un libre, du libres, un angul, tri angules, li tric, li trics, li plug, li plugs, li album, pluri albums, li tram, du trams.\nPersonal pronouns.\nInterlingue has two forms for the personal pronouns: one for the subject form (nominative), and the other for the object form (accusative or dative).\nGrammatical endings are used, but less than in Esperanto and Ido. Esperanto and Ido mark parts of speech with obligatory endings. Only a few parts of speech (such as verb infinitives) in Interlingue have entirely obligatory endings, while many others either have endings the usage of which is optional and sometimes recommended. Some grammatical endings are:\nVerbs.\nVerbs in Interlingue have three endings: -ar, -er, and -ir. Conjugation is performed with a combination of endings and auxiliary verbs. The verb esser (to be) is exceptional in being written es in the present tense, though the esse form is seen in the imperative.\nAdverbs.\nInterlingue has primary adverbs and derived adverbs. Primary adverbs are adverbs without special endings: \"tre\" (very), \"sempre\" (always), etc.\nDerived adverbs are adverbs made by putting -men at the end of an adjective (rapid = quick, rapidmen = quickly). The ending may be omitted when the meaning is clear: tu deve far it rapid(men) = you must do it quick(ly).\nLiterature.\nThe main literary texts in Occidental appeared in \"Cosmoglotta\". There were also some works, both original and translated, published in Interlingue. Other texts appeared in the magazine Helvetia but these were less common. \"Micri chrestomathie\" is an example of a translated work, featuring a compilation of texts by Jaroslav Podobsk\u00fd, H. P\u00e1\u0161ma and Jan Kaj\u0161 published in 1933.\nSome original texts published as separate books are:"}

However, there may or may not be a grain of truth from which the story originated.\nUrban legends and the Internet.\nThe Internet has made it easier for urban legends to spread, as people often spread them to their friends or family using e-mail. As a result, some websites such as Snopes.com and TruthOrFiction.com, among others, have been made that look at urban legends and try to see whether or not they are true.\nAn example of an urban legend is a report that years after the defeat of St Clair in 1791 at Ft Recovery Mercer Country Ohio - a skeleton of a Captain Roger Vanderberg was found in Miami County Ohio inside a tree along with a diary; in fact no one of this name was a casualty of the 1791 battle - it was a story that orginated in 1864 from a Scottish novel! Another example of a urban legend is a young woman and her mother going to visit the Paris Exposition; the mother falls ill, the daughter rushes off to get help only to find her mother gone! The woman either goes insane or is told the truth-her mother had the plague which was the reason for the coverup. This became the premise of a 1950s movie \"So Long at the Fair\". In fact the basis for the legend was a story in 1897 in a Philadelphia newspaper...and no other sources in fact!\nOther urban legends concern the Chase Burial Vault in Barbadoes although the lone account has no other basis in fact. Another urban legend concerns organized crime: In New York city at the turn of the century there was a \"Murder Stable\" where criminals killed one another. In fact, the report was exaggerated. Allegedly, an unknown killer named \"Shotgun Man\" committed dozens of murders with a shotgun in Chicago, Illinois after the turn of the century between 1910 and 1911 - although a check of a database of Chicago murders from that time period shows only one shotgun killings between 1900 and 1920."}

It is related to the distribution of prime numbers. It also has uses in other areas such as physics, probability theory, and applied statistics. It is named after the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, who wrote about it in the memoir \"\", published in 1859. \nThe Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Many mathematicians consider the Riemann hypothesis to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics.\n In the year 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute included the Riemann hypothesis as one of their Millennium Prize Problems, promising a reward of US$1 million to anyone who could solve it.\nDefinition.\nWhen using mathematical symbols to describe the Riemann zeta function, it is represented as an infinite series:\nwhere formula_2 is the real part of the complex number formula_3. For example, if formula_4, then formula_5 (where formula_6).\nThis makes a sequence. The first few terms of this sequence would be, \nHowever, this doesn't apply for numbers where formula_8, since if we interpret this function as an infinite sum, the sum does not converge. Instead, it diverges. This means that instead of nearing a specific value, it will get infinitely large. Riemann used analytic continuation, so that he could give a value to all numbers except 1. formula_9 represents the harmonic series, which diverges, meaning that the sum does not near any specific number. \nLeonhard Euler discovered the first results about the series that this function represents in the eighteenth century. He proved that the Zeta function can be written as an infinite product of prime numbers. In mathematical notation: \nformula_10\nThis is an infinite product. formula_11 means that only prime numbers are included in the product. The first few terms of the product would look like: \nZeros, the critical line, and the Riemann hypothesis.\nMathematicians are interested in those values of formula_3 for which the function is equal to zero. The Riemann hypothesis conjectures that all the \"non-trivial zeros\" lie on the critical line formula_14, meaning they are guessed to be of the form formula_15 for some real value \"t\". It is already known that all of the non-trivial zeroes must lie in a region called the \"critical strip\" for which formula_16. So far, all of the computed nontrivial zeros are on the critical line. \nProving or disproving the hypothesis has been very difficult, and is still troubling mathematicians to this day."}

Its leaves are 15-25 cm long and 1.5-4 cm broad at the base. It is sold in the developed world as \"Lucky Bamboo\" often cited as being good for feng shui. This name is a misnomer however, as the plant is not related to bamboo. New plants come from short cuttings which are often kept in water.\nCultivation and uses.\n\"Dracaena sanderiana\" and related plants are popular houseplants. There are many cultivars. The plant can survive in many indoor conditions, but indirect lighting is best. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to turn yellow and burn.\nAlthough it grows better in soil, it often is sold with the roots in water. The water should be completely changed every two weeks. The water should be bottled water, soft tap water with very little fluoride, or even water from a filtered, established aquarium. It does best in bright, indirect lighting and temperatures between 15\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C.\nPet stores often sell this plant in black plastic pots with slots in them. They say that it can live under the water. \"Dracaena sanderiana\" will only live for a few months under the water. It will start to rot unless the leaves are allowed to grow above the water's surface.\nYellow or brown leaf edges may be caused by too much direct light, crowded roots, or fluoridated or chlorinated water. Salty or softened water can also cause brown leaf edges. \nTwisted shapes are made by rotating the plant so that it bends towards the light. This is hard to do for many people, but patient people can make the plant take on new shapes."}

It was lost for many years until it was found again in Mexico in 2007. \nBuilt in 1964, the car ran with a 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and a Powerglide automatic transmission. The body was made by hand out of fiberglass. The driver sat in a cockpit set all the way to the back of the car. This was where racing drivers sat when they drove a drag racing car. It was lined with a funny-looking material called \"fake fur\" and it even had an 11\" General Electric portable television in the console. On top of the cockpit was a top made of heavy, clear plastic. A top like this is called a \"bubble top\" since it looks like half of a soap bubble sitting on top of the driver. It raised up by itself with the push of a doorbell button on top of the hood. The hood raised by itself as well when a different button was pushed.\nRoth built the frame himself out of box-shaped steel tubing. The engine came from one of his 1955 Chevrolets. He removed it so that he could put in a newer, larger V8 engine given to him by General Motors. The Orbitron was one of the very few cars which MRoth thought was a \"mistake\" after he built it. He was very proud of the shiny chrome work he did to the engines and frames of his cars; the Orbitron's engine and frame were covered by the body. The Orbitron was one of his few custom cars to even have a hood. It was said that the automatic hood did not fit well.\nThe Orbitron's most fun feature was its front end. It had three red, green and blue tinted headlamps. It was thought that combining the lights would make a white light; the idea came from color television.\nAnother car builder, Darryl Starbird, bought the Orbitron from Mr. Roth in 1967 for US$750.00. Mr. Starbird traded it to a man in Texas, but Mr. Starbird does not remember the man's name. From Texas the Orbitron was traded to a carnival owner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, Mexico in 1991. By that time the special nose had been cut off and thrown away, possibly to help keep the engine cool as it was driven around the carnivals.\nMichael Lightbourn, a man who restores old cars, heard that the Orbitron was in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. He discovered it parked in front of an adult bookstore where it was in very poor shape and was being used as a trash can. \nThe car, which used to be painted blue, had been spray painted in black and was almost complete except for the hood, the television, the fur lining, the cut-off nose and the bubble top. The top had to be destroyed in the early 1970s when it became stuck and trapped someone inside. \nThe family who owned the bookstore had also owned the carnival in which the car was used. After Mr. Lightbourn made a deal with the family, he was able to bring the Orbitron to the United States. It was then sold to Beau Boeckmann, the host of the TV show \"Pimp My Ride.\" He fully restored the Orbitron in 100 days. He made it exactly like it was when it was new. All the original parts which could not be used and which Mr. Boeckmann removed from the car, including the frame which was too rusted to reuse, were stored away. Mr. Roth died in 2001, but Mr. Boeckmann was able to get help from men who helped design and build the car in 1964, including designer Ed \"Newt\" Newton and painter Larry Watson. The inside was redone by Joe Perez who did the original job.\nThe restoration even includes the same type of television. A small tape recorder and tape were found hidden in the cockpit. This was played when the car was new. It told people who were looking at the car what made it special and it still works today. Planet Plastics of Chino, California, the original company which made the bubble top, was asked to create a replacement. Little bits of the car's original \"candy blue\" color (similar to a very fancy color called \"candy apple red\") were found inside the car. They were used to match the color of the new paint. The original Chevrolet engine with its very special carburetors and Chevrolet Corvette aluminum valve covers has been rebuilt and put back in the Orbitron.\nIt is on the cover of the March 2009 edition of \"Hot Rod Deluxe\", a \"retro\" version of \"Hot Rod Magazine\"."}

{"id": "172535", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172535", "title": "Stan Lee", "text": "Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber ; December 28, 1922\u00a0\u2013 November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, and publisher. Lee was known for being Marvel Comics' lead creative leader for almost 21 years.\nWith his work alongside co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he co-created many popular fictional characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Captain America, and Ant-Man.\nFollowing his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a public figurehead for the company, and made cameo appearances in movies based on Marvel characters. Meanwhile, he continued independent creative works into his 1990s, until his death in 2018.\nLee was added into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008 from President George W. Bush.\nEarly life.\nLee was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New York City, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents. His parents were Celia (\"n\u00e9e\" Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue. His father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression, His family moved further uptown in Manhattan, in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee had one younger brother named Larry Lieber.\nAt an early age, Lee was inspired by books and movies, especially those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles. By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in an apartment in The Bronx. Lee described it as \"a third-floor apartment facing out back\". Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch.\nLee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He enjoyed writing, and had dreams of one day writing the \"Great American Novel\". He said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for newspapers for the National Tuberculosis Center. He delivered sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center, worked at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway, and sold subscriptions to the \"New York Herald Tribune\" newspaper. He graduated from high school early in 1939 and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project.\nEarly career.\nWith the help of his uncle Robbie Solomon, Lee became an assistant in 1939 at the new Timely Comics division of pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman's company. By the 1960s, they would evolve into Marvel Comics.\nHis first role in the comics were, as Lee described in 2009: \"In those days [the artists] dipped the pen in ink, [so] I had to make sure the inkwells were filled...I went down and got them their lunch, I did proofreading, I erased the pencils from the finished pages for them\". Lee made his comic-book debut with the text filler \"Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge\" in \"Captain America Comics\" #3 (May 1941). This is where he first used the pseudonym Stan Lee, which years later he would become his legal name. Lee later explained that he was so embarrassed that he used a pen name so that nobody would associate his real name with comics when he some day wrote the Great American Novel.\nLee's first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer, in \"Mystic Comics\" #6 (August 1941). Other characters he co-created during this period, which was called the Golden Age of Comic Books, include Jack Frost and Father Time.\nIn 1941, Lee, just under 19 years old, became interim editor. He soon became the comic-book division's editor-in-chief, as well as art director for much of that time, until 1972, when he became publisher.\nLee entered the United States Army in early 1942. He was a member of the Signal Corps, repairing telegraph poles and other communications equipment. He was later transferred to the Training Film Division, where he worked writing manuals, training movies, slogans, and cartooning. The army classified Lee as a \"playwright\", making him one of the nine men in the U.S. Army were given that title. Lee returned from his World War II military service in 1945.\nIn the mid-1950s, the company was known as Atlas Comics, Lee wrote stories of many genres including romance, Westerns, humour science fiction, medieval adventure, horror and suspense. By the end of the decade, Lee was not happy with his career and thought about quitting the field.\nMarvel Comics.\nIn the late 1950s, DC Comics created the Justice League making comic book superheros more popular. In response, publisher Lee was hired to come up with a new superhero team. Lee's wife, Joan, said that he experiment with stories he liked, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose.\nLee followed his wife's advice and created a set of heroes with character flaws because many heroes before were seen as nearly perfect beings.\nThe first superheroes Lee and artist Jack Kirby created together were the Fantastic Four. They became popular which led Lee and Marvel's illustrators to create new heroes. Again working with Kirby, Lee co-created the Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, and the X-Men; with Bill Everett, Daredevil; and with Steve Ditko, Doctor Strange and Marvel's most successful character, Spider-Man. As a result, Lee created a shared universe between the fictional heroes. Lee and Kirby combined several of their newly created characters together into the team title \"The Avengers\".\nLee's revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators. He introduced the practice of regularly including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the Bullpen Bulletins page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style. Lee remarked that his goal was for fans to think of the comics creators as friends, and considered it a mark of his success on this front that, at a time when letters to other comics publishers were typically addressed \"Dear Editor\", letters to Marvel addressed the creators by first name (e.g. \"Dear Stan and Jack\").\nIn the 1960s, Lee wrote, drew and edited most of Marvel's series and wrote a monthly column called \"Stan's Soapbox\". He wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, \"Excelsior!\". Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a short synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the number of pages left by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling.\nAfter Ditko's left Marvel in 1966, John Romita Sr. became Lee's collaborator on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Within a year, it overtook \"Fantastic Four\" to become the company's top seller. Lee and Romita's stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories talked about issues at the time such as the Vietnam War, political elections, and student activism. Lee created the Black Panther, an African king who would be mainstream comics' first black superhero.\nLee and artist John Buscema created \"The Silver Surfer\" series in August 1968.\nThe following year, Lee and Gene Colan created the Falcon, comics' first African-American superhero in \"Captain America\" #117 (September 1969). Then in 1971, Lee helped change the Comics Code. The U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare had asked Lee to write a comic-book story about the dangers of drugs. As a result, Lee created a three-issue story in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #96\u201398 (cover-dated May\u2013July 1971), in which Peter Parker's best friend becomes addicted to prescription drugs. The Comics Code Authority did not approve of this because the stories depicted drug use. However, Lee had the story published without the seal of approval from the authority. The comics sold well and Marvel had positive reviews for its focus on mature social issues.\nLee supported using comic books to criticize social events about the real world, often talking about racism and bigotry.\nIn 1972, Lee stopped writing monthly comic books to become publisher. His final issue of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was #110 (July 1972) and his last \"Fantastic Four\" was #125 (August 1972).\nLater career.\nLee became a public face for Marvel Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around America, teaching at colleges and participating in panel discussions. Lee created the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip on January 3, 1977. Lee's final work with Jack Kirby, \"The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience\", was published in 1978. Lee and John Buscema produced the first issue of \"The Savage She-Hulk\" (February 1980). \nLee moved to California in 1981 to work on Marvel's television and movie properties. Lee was briefly president of the entire company, but soon stepped down to become publisher instead. Lee said that being president of the company was too much about numbers and finance and not enough about the creative process he enjoyed.\nLee stepped away from regular duties at Marvel in the 1990s. He continued to receive an annual salary of $1 million as Chairman Emeritus. In 1998 he and Peter Paul began a new Internet-based superhero creation, production, and marketing studio, Stan Lee Media. After legal issues, Stan Lee Media filed for bankruptcy in February 2001.\nFollowing the success of Fox Studio's 2000 \"X-Men\" movie and Sony's then-current \"Spider-Man\" movie, Lee sued Marvel in 2002. He sued company because he believed they failed to pay him the 10% he was due under the terms of his contract for movies featuring the characters he had co-created. They settled in 2005 for an unknown amount of money.\nAt the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Lee announced his YouTube channel, \"Stan Lee's World of Heroes\", which airs programs created by Lee, Mark Hamill, Peter David, Adrianne Curry and Bonnie Burton, among others. Lee wrote the book \"Zodiac\", released in January 2015, with Stuart Moore.\nAt the 2016 Comic-Con International, Lee introduced his digital graphic novel \"Stan Lee's God Woke\". The print-book version won the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards' Outstanding Books of the Year Independent Voice Award.\nLee was an executive producer on most Marvel movie and television shows beginning with the 1990 direct-to-video \"Captain America\" movie. He had cameo appearances in many Marvel movies and television shows, especially those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nPersonal life.\nIn a 2002, survey of whether he believed in God, he said: \"Well, let me put it this way... [Pauses.] No, I'm not going to try to be clever. I really don't know. I just don't know\".\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Lee lived in Manhattan. He married Joan Clayton Boocock on December 5, 1947, and in 1949, the couple bought a house on Long Island, living there through 1952. Their daughter Joan Celia \"J. C.\" Lee was born in 1950. Another child, daughter Jan Lee, died three days after delivery in 1953.\nLee lived in the Long Island town of Hewlett Harbor, New York, from 1952 to 1980. They also owned a condominium in Manhattan from 1975 to 1980. He moved in Los Angeles in 1981, they bought a home in West Hollywood, California.\nIn September 2012, Lee had surgery to add a pacemaker.\nOn July 6, 2017, his wife of 69 years, Joan, died of complications from a stroke, aged 95. In April 2018, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that Lee was a victim of elder abuse.\nDeath.\nLee died at the age of 95 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, on November 12, 2018. The cause was respiratory and congestive heart failure. Earlier that year, Lee publicly said that he had pneumonia in February and was rushed to the hospital for worsening conditions at around the same time."}

Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from identical positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.\nAstronomers use the principle of parallax to measure distances to celestial objects including to the Moon, the Sun, and to stars beyond the Solar System. Here, the term \"parallax\" is the angle between two sight-lines to the star.\nAstronomical measurement of position are taken at different times of the year. Since the Earth's orbit is known exactly, the distance from position 1 to position 2 can be worked out. The angle from the horizon to the object can be measured precisely. This gives a triangle whose baseline and angles are known accurately. From the triangle, the distance is calculated by trigonometry and expressed in parsecs.\nThe method only fails with objects which are so distant that the earth's orbit is too small to get a large enough parallax angle to measure accurately. This distance is about 100 light-years. Astronomers have invented various ways to solve this problem, though none are so accurate as the parallax method is for relatively nearby objects. This provides a basis for the cosmic distance ladder of techniques to calculate greater distances.\nFrom 1989 to 1993 the Hipparcos satellite took measurements for over 100,000 nearby stars. Gaia (spacecraft) is intended to make similar measurements of about a Billion stars. \nMany animals, including humans, have two eyes which provide depth perception; this is called stereopsis. Because the two eyes are at different places on the head, this gives the basis for an automatic sense of distance. We perceive this as a normal 3-D scene."}

Glow fuel can be burned by very simple two-stroke engines or by four-stroke engines. Engines like this provide lots of power in a small size.\nSometimes, glow fuel is called nitro or just model fuel. Some model fuel has only a little bit of nitro, but some fuel has none at all. It is called \"FAI fuel.\" \"FAI\" stands for F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale. They say that models used in racing or other competition under their rules may not have any nitro in their mix.\nGlow fuel is mostly made of methanol, nitromethane and oil.\nMethanol is the main ingredient. It provides most of the fuel's ability to burn. In order to burn the glow fuel, a glow engine must have a glow plug. The glow plug burns very hot as the engine runs because of a catalytic reaction with the methanol. Since the engines turn very fast, a phenomenon known as thermal inertia helps to keep the plug glowing as the engine runs. A small amount of electricity is used to cause the glow plug to glow as the engine is started. Once the engine is running, the electricity is disconnected. \nNitromethane is added to the fuel for more power and to make the engine easier to tune. Nitromethane contains less energy than the same amount of methanol, but it requires less oxygen. This means that more of it can be put into an engine during each turn of the engine. This leads to more power.\nFuel for most model planes, boats and helicopters has 5% to 15% nitromethane. For use in race cars, the nitromethane can be from 30% to as much as 65%.\nNitromethane is hard to get in some countries since it is known as an explosive. In these countries, glow fuel sometimes has no nitromethane at all. \nSince the engine doesn't have its own supply of oil, it's instead added to the fuel to help lubricate the moving parts and to keep them from burning up. The oil can be castor oil or synthetic oils. Some fuels include a mixture of the two. The oils included in glow fuel are not burned by the engine. Instead, the oil comes out of the exhaust. Not only does the oil lubricate the moving parts, but the oil which comes out the engine helps carry away extra heat.\nGlow engines should be run slightly \"rich.\" This means that the mix of fuel and air going into the engine has to have a bit more fuel in it than it can burn at once. This unburned fuel and oil help keep the engine cool. After a model has been run, it is coated with a film of oil and must be cleaned. Ordinary window cleaner and a paper towel do a nice job of removing the oil. \nGlow fuel is not difficult to make, but some of the ingredients are dangerous in large amounts. Instead, most modelers buy their glow fuel already made. Some very small engines require more oil than larger engines. More oil may be needed in the fuel. The proper oil can be found at a hobby shop. Companies which make glow fuel mix their fuels with the help of computers. This helps each batch of fuel be of the highest quality it can be. "}

It is controlled by the Austrian Football Association (German: \u00d6sterreichischer Fu\u00dfballbund - \u00d6FB).\nHistory before the Second World War.\nThe first official match took place on 12th October 1902 in Vienna when a team from Cisleithanien (Austrian part of the Austrian-Hungary Empire) played versus Hungary. (5:0) The team reached in the 1930s the best time. It was the time of the so-called \"Wunderteam\" (miracle team) when Austria was one of the leading teams in Europe. The Wunderteam was the first from the continent to defeat Scotland. In 1934 the team was took part in the FIFA world cup for the first time and reached the 4th place. 1936 Austria won the silver medal at the Olympic games in Berlin. Due to the occupation through Germany in 1938 there was no team between 1938 and 1945. The national team was dissolved and the players like Matthias Sindelar became part of the German team.\n1945 to 1962.\nSoon after the end of the war the Austrian team played their first matches versus Hungary in Budapest. On December 6th, 1945 the first homematch took place in the renovated Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion). France was beaten by 4:1. Soon Austria was as successful as before the war. In 1951 Scotland was beaten in his own stadium by 1:0. Austria was the first team from the continent to do so. The FIFA World cup 1954 was the most successful ever. A legendary match was the quarterfinal against Switzerland which won Austria 7:5. It is still till today the Worldcup match with the most goals scored. Austria reached the semifinals and was beaten by the later world champion Germany by 1:6. The match for the 3rd place was won by 3:1 versus Uruguay. Players like Gerhard Hanappi, Walter Zeman and Ernst Ocwirk were playing in the FIFA world team. A 0:6 versus the Czech team marked the end of Austrias golden periode.\n1962 to present.\nThe next years Austria was an average team but surprised through notable wins. On was on 20 October 1965 when Austria won in England 3:2. Austria was the third team to do so. In the same year however Austria failed to qualify for the 1966 World Cup. Also the qualification for 1970 was a failure. The qualification for 1974 was missed after a 1:2 versus Sweden in a decider.\nAfter 20 years Austria could qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The last match versus Turkey was won 1:0 through a goal by the later team coach Herbert Prohaska. In the tournament Austria won the groupstage. But after two lost matches versus Netherlands and Italy they failed to reach the final round. The last match was versus Germany in Cordoba. Austria won 3:2 through two goals by Hans Krankl and an own goal by Bertie Vogts. In Austria this is a legendary match. In the 1982 World Cup Austria also played. After two matches with wins versus Algeria and Chile a narrow loss against Germany was enough. Germany had to win to promote to the final round. The match ended 1:0 for Germany and especially in Algeria there were manipulation reproaches. After the 1982 Cup a lot of players ended their career, so Austria failed to reach the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nUnder coach Josef Hickersberger Austria could qualify for the 1990 World Cup. He called back old players like Herbert Prohaska and mixed them with new players like Andreas Herzog who had only three league matches played before the Championship. After losses versus Italy and Czechoslovakia and a win versus USA they failed in the first round.\nShortly after the World Cup Hickersberger resigned after a 0:1 versus the Faroe Islands in Landskrona, Sweden. On the islands there was no stadium with grass and all the players were pure amateurs. This match was a great disgrace for Austrians team.\nThe last appearance of an Austrian team in a World Cup tournament was 1998 in France. Austria failed in the qualifing round versus Italy, Chile and Cameroon. As host Austria was qualified for the UEFA Euro 2008 and played versus Poland, Croatia and Germany. After losses versus Germany and Croatia and a draw versus Poland Austria could not qualify for the quarter finals.\nAustria failed to qualify for the World Cup 2006 and 2010 and also for the UEFA Euro 2012."}

It was an Ancient Greek analogue computer and orrery. It was discovered in 1902 in a shipwreck off the coast of Antikythera, Greece.\nA number of gears worked together, much like they do in a mechanical clock. The device could predict astronomical positions, eclipses, the motions of the sun, the moon and probably some of the planets. This makes it possible to use the device as a calendar. There were three big dials, and three small ones. Used as a calendar the main functions were:\nThe device was found on a shipwreck, near the island of Antikythera, between the Peloponnese and Crete. Different coins were also found on the wreck. There are coins from Pergamon, dating between 86 BC and 67 BC, and coins from Ephesus, dating between 70 BC and 60 BC. This means that the ship sunk between 70 and 60 BC. This device is the most complex device known in Antiquity. Only in the 14th century did people again have the knowledge to build similar devices.\nThe device is now on display in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.\nWhen the mechanism was found, it consisted of corroded metal plates. Before x-rays could be used to show what was \"inside\", it was very difficult to judge what the mechanism did. Many of the parts that make up the mechanism were lost either during the roughly 2000 years it had laid on the sea floor, or shortly after discovery. Many gears have not \"survived\" in one piece. None of the scales is complete, and only one indicator survived as a fragment. The Antikythera Research project has produced a reconstruction; it added seven gears that were probably part of the device. There are 35 gears, and seven displays. There are many hints that the device was also used to calculate and show the movement of stars, even though none of the necessary gears or displays have been found.\nMechanism of operation.\nThere were 82 parts in total. With the parts found it is not possible to get the mechanism with all displays and dials fully operational. It is also not possible to know how many parts have been lost. In total, 30 gears were found. One gear is probably part of a planetary display, that has been lost. To make the reconstructed displays work, another eight gears would be necessary, but they have been lost. There are two crown gears, all the other gears found are normal gears (that require a special alignment of the axes). The gear was a primitive one, and the transmission was not uniform. The mechanism was repaired at least once, which shows that it must have been used often."}

It also celebrates a miracle that happened during this time, where just a day's supply of oil allowed the menorah (Hanukkiah or Hanukkah Menorah) in the rededicated \"Temple in Jerusalem\" to remain lit for eight days. Therefore, Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah for eight days. Hanukkah begins on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which on the Gregorian calendar is late November or December. For example, in 2013 it started on November 27. The Hebrew word \"\" means re\"dedication\".\nThe \"hanukiah\" (or \"hanukkah menorah\") is a candle holder, an important Hanukkah symbol. It has nine branches. Traditionally, one candle is separated from the rest, usually by being higher than the other eight. On the first night, only one candle is lit, on the right side of the hanukiah. On the second night, a second candle is added, and they are lit from left to right -- but the Hanukkiah is filled from right to left. This continues for all eight nights. The candles are never lit directly - instead, the higher candle, (called a \"shamash\", meaning \"attendant\") is lit first, and then used to light the rest of the candles. While the candles are lit, blessings are said over them.\nJewish children often play a game called dreidel. The dreidel is a four-sided spinning top, each side having a Hebrew letter. The four letters (nun, gimel, hey, and shin) stand for the Hebrew phrase, \"Nes gadol haya shaam,\" meaning, \"A great miracle happened there.\" In Israel, by contrast, the dreidel reads \"Po\" instead of \"shaam,\" meaning \"here.\" So in Israel the phrase is, \"a great miracle happened here.\"\nHistory of Hanukkah.\nApproximately 2,200 years ago, there was a war between the Greeks and the Jews. The Greeks won and forced their culture on the Jews. A group of Jewish people called the Maccabees revolted and liberated Jerusalem. The Maccabees found their Temple defiled. They sought to rededicate it to God, as the Greeks had been worshipping Zeus there. As part of the rededication, they needed to relight the menorah, whose source of fuel was olive oil.\nAccording to the Talmud, the Jewish people only found a single jar of undefiled oil, and that oil was only enough to last a single day. The Jewish people took a leap of faith and relit the menorah. To their surprise, the menorah stayed lit for eight days, which was seven more days than they expected. The Jewish people attributed the surprising amount of time that the oil lasted to God (a miracle).\nHanukkah is an eight-day celebration, and each day commemorates each day that the oil lasted.

It was started in 1903. \nThe orchestra gave its first public concert under the conductor, Alonso Cordel\u00e1s on 7 February 1904 at the Teatro Real. The next year Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez Arb\u00f3s became conductor of the orchestra, and he stayed with them for more than 30 years. The orchestra played a lot of Spanish music as well as music by composers from other European countries. Some very famous people such as Igor Stravinsky and Richard Strauss conducted the orchestra. The orchestra gave the first performances of famous pieces such as: Falla's \"Nights in the Gardens of Spain\" (1916) and Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto (1935). \nDuring the Spanish Civil War it was difficult to keep the concerts going. After the war, in June 1939, Arb\u00f3s died and many of the musicians had gone into exile because of the rise of the dictator General Francisco Franco. The conductor Enrique Jord\u00e1 kept the orchestra going until 1945 when the World War II ended.\nFrom 1958 the orchestra often played for comic Spanish operas called zarzuelas. They often travelled through Spain and to Portugal and Latin America giving concerts..\nIn 1965 a new orchestra, the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de RTVE, was started. This made things difficult for the Madrid Symphony Orchestra. They had to spend a lot of time playing for the Teatro de la Zarzuela. In the 1970s they made a lot of recordings of zarzuelas and Spanish operas. The recordings were very good, but they did not have much time for orchestral concerts.\nAfter Franco\u2019s death the orchestra became the official orchestra for the Teatro de la Zarzuela. Later, when a new concert hall, the Auditorio Nacional de M\u00fasica was opened, the orchestra had more opportunity to give orchestra concerts. In 1997, the Orchestra moved out of the Teatro de la Zarzuela and moved to the Teatro Real where they will stay at least until 2009. The orchestra now have an educational plan to help young children listen to music and encourage them to play instruments.\nToday the orchestra is conducted by Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez Cobos."}

Sweet potatoes contain a lot of fiber and beta-carotene. They are eaten around the world.\nNaming.\nThe sweet potato is not closely related to the common potato, but they both share the same name origin. The first Europeans to taste sweet potatoes were members of Christopher Columbus's expedition in 1492. There were local names for different cultivars for the sweet potato. However, the part of the name that remained was the indigenous Taino name of the potato, \"batata\". The Spanish combined the word \"batata\" with the Quechua word for potato, \"papa\", to create the word \"patata\" for the common potato.\nIn Argentina, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic the sweet potato is called \"batata\". In Mexico, Peru, Chile, Central America, and the Philippines, the sweet potato is known as \"camote\" (\"kamote\") in the Philippines).\nIn Peru, the Quechua name for a type of sweet potato is \"kumar\". This is very similar to the Polynesian name \"kumara\". This interesting naming pattern has led some scholars to suspect that the Polynesians were related to native South Americans.\nIn New Zealand, the most common cultivar is the red (which is actually colored purple) cultivar called \"kumara\". Kumara is very popular as a roasted food, often served with sour cream and sweet chili sauce. Occasionally, shops in Australia will label New Zealand purple cultivars as \"purple sweet potato\" to make it appear different from other cultivars. About 95% of Australia's production of sweet potatoes is the orange cultivar named 'Beauregard', originally from North America, known simply as \"sweet potato\".\nHistory.\nIn Peru, the use of sweet potatoes dates to 8000 BC.\nSweet potatoes were introduced a food crop in Japan in 1735 and in Korea in 1764."}

The band was started in 1993 by the former guitarist of Ceremonial Oath, Oscar Dronjak.\nHistory.\n1993-1996.\nHammerFall began when guitarist Oscar Dronjak quit Ceremonial Oath and invited Jesper Str\u00f6mblad from In Flames to join him as a drummer on a new band he had been thinking about for a long time. Dronjak had already made the song \"Steel Meets Steel\", which was included on HammerFall's first album. They were later joined by guitarist Niklas Sundin, bassist Johann Larsson and vocalist Mikael Stanne. When Niklas Sundin and Johann Larsson left HammerFall the next year, Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m and Fredrik Larsson replaced them.\nBoth Dronjak and Str\u00f6mblad were in other bands: Dronjak was in \"Crystal Age\", Str\u00f6mblad was in In Flames. Because of this, HammerFall was not very active during this time. The only concert they played was a local music contest called \"Rockslaget\". The band had not written many songs yet, and usually only played covers of bands like Pretty Maids, Judas Priest and Alice Cooper.\nIn 1996, HammerFall was playing in \"Rockslaget\". They found out Mikael Stanne was not going to be able to perform with the band. Because of this, they started looking for a new singer. They got in contact with Joacim Cans, who agreed to play with them for the night. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.\n\"Glory to the Brave\".\nTo try to get a record deal, HammerFall recorded a live concert and sent it to the Dutch label, Vic Records. The band got an offer, and spent the rest of the year recording \"Glory to the Brave\". The album was released in the Netherlands first and did pretty well.\nAs HammerFall became more famous, some of the band members needed to leave because they were already in other bands. To fill the empty musical spots, Stefan Elmgren assumed the lead guitar and Patrik R\u00e4fling assumed the drums and Fredrik decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. In May of 1997, bassist Magnus Ros\u00e9n joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the \"Glory to the Brave\" album (such as the acoustic guitars on \"I Believe\") and Patrik R\u00e4fling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper, but only as a guest performers, not members of the band.\nIn early 1997, German label Nuclear Blast approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release of four albums. The deal was accepted and the band recorded two music videos \"HammerFall\" and \"Glory to the Brave\". After the release of a promotional single, \"Glory to the Brave\" was released in Europe. \nThey did their first tours in Europe with Gamma Ray, Jag Panzer, Lake of Tears and Raven.\nNear the end of 2007, \"Glory to the Brave\" was released in Japan and the United States. They sold over 100,000 copies of the album.\n\"Legacy of Kings\".\nIn February 1998, they began recording \"Legacy of Kings\". This album was made by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper. Jesper had already quit the band, but wanted to help with the album. The album was produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m (from Dream Evil) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. It took the band one and a half months to record the album.\nBefore releasing the album, they toured with Alice Cooper, Rammstein, Deep Purple, Dream Theater, Saxon and Stratovarius. On the tour, they played the Beach Boys album \"Wild Honey\" in its entirety.\nTheir first world tour was in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection, and he could not sing. Magnus Ros\u00e9n also caught the infection, and after him, all of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The band played for as long as possible and then were had to cancel some of their concerts. \nAfter the tour, Anders Johansson, a friend of Magnus Ros\u00e9n, joined as the new drummer.\n\"Renegade\".\nAfter many concerts, the band went back to Sweden and began writing songs for their next album. It took eight weeks to record, and they named it \"Renegade\". A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the Renegade, and it reached the top of the Swedish charts; then the album also reached the top of the charts.\nThe band's second world tour started in January 2001. \n\"Crimson Thunder\".\nAfter the tour, HammerFall recorded their fourth album \"Crimson Thunder\".\nWhile Joacim was at a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and ran away. Joacim had to be taken to a hospital, where he had plastic surgery and rested for a couple of days. \nHammerFall toured after the release of the album. The tour was stopped when Oscar Dronjak had a motorcycle accident, breaking his left arm. HammerFall took a break because of this. Stefan decided to start flying airplanes, Magnus and Anders worked with other bands, and Joacim started on his own project. Joacim also had his first child.\nOscar worked with a team of doctors to get healthy again. After recovering, he toured with HammerFall again.\n\"Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken\".\nTheir live album and DVD, \"One Crimson Night\", was released in February 2003. After this, they decided to take a break. Two years later, the band released \"\". A video for the song \"Blood Bound\" was made by director Roger Johansson.\n\"Threshold\".\nOn October 20, 2006, HammerFall released \"Threshold\".\nOn March 6, 2007, Magnus Ros\u00e9n left the band. He said he didn't like being in HammerFall because the bass parts of the song were too easy to play, and wanted more of a challenge.\nOn April 2, 2008 Stefan Elmgren decided to leave HammerFall so he could become and airplane pilot. Pontus Norgren from The Poodles took over guitar in the band. \n\"No Sacrifice, No Victory\".\nHammerFall's latest album, No Sacrifice, No Victory, was released February 23, 2009.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums"}

{"id": "173399", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173399", "title": "Paper clip", "text": "A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a piece of plastic or metal that is used to hold pieces of paper together.\nShape.\nA paper clip is usually a thin wire in a shape that is wrapped in on itself. It is used to hold two or more pieces of paper together by pressure. Some other kinds of paper clips use two pieces.\nThe type of wire paper clip that is usually used was never patented. It was first made by The Gem Manufacturing Company sometime during the 1890s. The first time Gem was mentioned was in 1883, but historians do not think this is when they began making paper clips. The first advertisement for paper clips was in August 1894. The \"Gem\" name was trademarked in the United States in 1904. The trademark paperwork said that the paper clip had been sold since March 1892.\nIt has been said that Herbert Spencer invented the paper clip.\nIt is proven that the paper clip was well known by 1899. A patent was given that year for a \"machine to make wire paper clips\" to William Middlebrook on April 27. The drawing in the patent shows a Gem paper clip. There are many different kinds of paper clips. Some have ends instead of round ones. Some have a bent end. This was done so that it is easier to put paper in. Some of them have wires with bumps that allow them to hold the paper better. Some paper clips are made to look good. They are sometimes in a triangle or a circle.\nNorway's claim.\nA Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866\u20131910), has sometimes been called the inventor of the paper clip. He was given patents in Germany and in the United States for a paper clip of a different design\nAfter Vaaler died, some Norwegians made a myth that the paper clip was invented by a Norwegian genius. Dictionaries since the 1950s have said that Vaaler is the inventor of the paper clip. Dictionaries in other countries sometimes say this now too.\nVaaler was probably given a patent in other countries because patent laws in the 1800s were not as tough as they are today. Vaaler worked in a patent office, or place that deals with patents, and could have given himself a patent very easily.\nThe patents that Vaaler held have since expired. The Gem paper clip was used around the world, including in Norway. His device did not work as well as the Gem version. This was because it was hard to put pieces of paper in it, and it did not look as good when there was paper in it.\nNational symbol.\nThe person who started the Norwegian paper clip myth was a person who worked for Norway's patent office. He visited Germany in the 1920s to get patents for some Norwegian inventions. He came across Vaaler's patent, and did not realize that it was not the same as the Gem paper clip. In a pamphlet put out by the patent office in celebration of its first 50 years, he wrote about how Vaaler was the inventor of the paper clip. This was put into many Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.\nThe war helped make the paper clip into a national symbol. Some Norwegian patriots wore them on the outside of their clothing as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi rulers when they were not allowed to protest. Soon, the Nazi's made wearing them illegal.\nThe first Norwegian encyclopedia did mention it as a symbol of resistance, but did not call it a Norwegian invention. According to the encyclopedia, the idea started in France.\nAfter the war, Norway believed the paper clip was a national symbol. Authors of books on the history of Norwegian technology used its status to make their stories bigger. The did not mention that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the Gem clip. In 1989, a big paper clip, almost 7 meters tall was put up in a college near Oslo in honor of Vaaler. The monument is a Gem paper clip, and not the one that was patented by Vaaler. In 1999, 100 years after the German patent was accepted, Norway celebrated by making a postage stamp that had a paper clip on it. However, it was once again the Gem paper clip in the stamp. In 2005, there was a Norwegian biography written about Johan Vaaler, 'The inventor of the paper clip.'\nOther uses.\nPaper clips are usually made out of wire. A paper clip can be useful when working with many things, like computers. The metal wire can be made straight with a little bit of work. Some things have buttons that cannot be reached by fingers if the people who make the device do not want users pressing them accidentally. Most CD-ROM drives have small buttons like this to eject the CD-ROM if there is not any power. A paper clip bent into a 'U' shape can be used to create a short circuit to start a computer if there is no power button.\nKyle MacDonald took one red paperclip and traded it for a house. He began with a red paper clip and posted it on craigslist, trading it for a pen. MacDonald kept trading things until he finally traded a movie role for a two-story house in Kipling, Saskatchewan.\nPaper clips can be used to pick a lock. Usually, professional lock picking tools are used, because most paper clips are not strong enough for this use.\nOther websites.\n\"Patents\""}

The British finally won after carrying out long and difficult protracted jungle campaigns against the Polygar armies and finally defeated them. Many lives were lost on both sides and the victory over Polygars made large part of territories of Tamil Nadu coming under British control enabling them to get a strong hold in India.\nFirst Polygar War 1799.\nThe war between the British and Kattabomman Nayak of Panchalankurichi Palayam in the then Tirunelveli region is often classified as the First Polygar war. In 1799, a brief meeting (over pending taxes) between Kattabomman and the British ended in a bloody encounter in which the British commander of the forces was slain by the former. A price was put on Kattabomman head prompting many Polygars to an open rebellion. \nAfter a series of battles in the Panchalankurichi fort with additional reinforcements from Thiruchirapalli, Kattabomman was defeated but he escaped to the jungles in Pudukottai country. Here he was captured by Pudukottai Rajah (after an agreement with the British) and after a summary trial Kattabomman was hanged in front of the public in order to intimidate them, near Kayattar Fort, close to the town of Kovilpatti and in front of fellow Polygars too who had been summoned to witness the execution.\nSubramania Pillai, a close associate of Kattabomman Nayak, was also publicly hanged and his head was fixed on a pike at Panchalankurichi for public view. Soundra Pandian Nayak, another rebel leader, was brutally done to death by having his head dashed against a village wall. Kattabomman\u2019s brother Oomaidurai was imprisoned in Palayankottai prison while the fort was razed to ground and his wealth looted by the troops.\nSecond Polygar War 1800-1805.\nDespite the suppression of the First Polygar War in 1799, rebellion broke out again in 1800. The Second war was more stealthy and covert in nature. The leaders operated more cohesive and united with people from Kerala and Mysore taking part. Also it marked the joining of entire west Tamil Nadu, Malabar and south Mysore regions (which was under British domain after the death of Tipu Sultan).Dheeran Chinnamalai commanded a vast army,He settled down at Odanilai and constructed a fort there to continue his struggle against the British, whom he defeated in battles at Cauvery in 1801, Odanilai in 1802 and Arachalur in 1804. Later, Dheeran Chinnamalai left his fort to avoid cannon attack and engaged in guerrilla warfare while he was stationed at Karumalai in the Palani region.\nHe was betrayed by his cook and captured by the British, who hanged him at Sankari Fort on July 31, 1805.\nDefeat.\nThe British finally won after a long expensive campaign that took more than a year. However, the superior British military who had recently defeated the powerful Tipu Sultan of Mysore quickly asserted itself. The British had better artillery compared to the Polygar troops who had country-made gunfire artillery, barring a few proper ones received from erstwhile Tipu Sultan's army. The war being regional in nature, the British forces could easily mobilize additional forces from other regions.\nSo savage and extensive was the death and destruction wrought by the English that the entire region was left in a state of terror.\nResults.\nDheeran Chinnamalai was betrayed by his cook and captured by the British, who hanged him at Sankari Fort on July 31 or August 2, 1805. At last entire region of Tamil Nadu came under the control of Britishers after the end of Chinnamalai.\nLater day folklore.\nTamil Nadu government constructed a \"mani mandapam\" (memorial) for Chinnamalai in Arachalur, Erode district at a cost of about 30 lakhs. Tamil Nadu government placed a statue of Chinnamalai in Chennai.[1]"}

He was born in Melapalayam, near Erode in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\nHe was one of the main leaders in the Polygar Wars and commanded a vast army, notably during the Second Polygar War that took place in 1801\u20131802.

This brightly colored parrot lives on the east coast of Australia, eastern Indonesia (Maluku and Western New Guinea), Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\nIn Australia, it is common along the eastern seaboard, from Queensland to South Australia and Tasmania. Its habitat is rainforest, coastal bush and woodland areas. \nIt has a number of subspecies. Some classifications list about 20 subspecies.\nIn some places, such as Western Australia and the North Island of New Zealand, they have been artificially introduced, and are seen as a pest species.\nDescription.\nThe rainbow lorikeet is a large lorikeet, about tall. It is has green feathers on its back, wings and tail. It has bright red feathers on the chest, with orange and yellow feathers on the sides of its chest. It has deep blue feathers on its abdomen and head. It also has stripes of yellow among its green feathers. It has a bright red bill with grey legs and feet.\nFeeding.\nRainbow lorikeets eat mostly fruit, pollen and nectar. They have a tongue adapted for their particular food. Nectar from eucalyptus is important in Australia. Other important sources of nectar are \"Pittosporum\", \"Grevillea\", \"Spathodea campanulata\" (African tulip-tree), and \"Metroxylon sagu\" (sago palm). In Melanesia, coconuts are a very important source of food, and rainbow lorikeets are important pollinators of coconuts. They also eat the fruits of \"Ficus\", \"Trema\", \"Mutingia\", as well as papaya and mangoes already opened by fruit bats. They also eat crops such as apples, and will take maize and sorghum. They will also visit bird feeders placed in gardens.\nIn many places, including campsites and suburban gardens, wild lorikeets are so used to humans that they can be fed by hand.\nSemi-tame lorikeets are common daily visitors in many backyards in Sydney. But, many people are ignorant of the food they need to eat, and feed them bread or bread coated with honey. Bread and honey do not have the nutrients, vitamins and minerals that the rainbow lorikeet needs, and this practice can lead to health and feather problems in young lorikeets. Packet mixes with a nutritional mix that is good for feeding lorikeets are generally available from vets and pet stores.\nBreeding.\nRainbow lorikeets are monogamous and pair for life. Male and female rainbow lorikeets look almost identical. They are strongly territorial, and chase off other birds.\nIn southern Australia, breeding usually happens from late winter to early summer (August to January). In other places in Australia, breeding has been recorded in every month except March. It depends on changes in food availability and climate. Nesting sites can include hollows of tall trees such as eucalyptus, palm trunks, or overhanging rock. One lorikeet population in the Admiralty Islands nests in holes in the ground on predator-free islets. Pairs sometimes nest in the same tree with other rainbow lorikeet pairs, or other types of bird. Rainbow lorikeets lay between one and three eggs, which are incubated for around 25 days. Incubation is carried out by the female alone.\nStatus.\nOverall, the rainbow lorikeet is widespread and often common. According to the annual Birdlife Australia census, it is the most commonly observed bird in Australia. It is considered to be a least concern species by BirdLife International.\nAs a pest.\nThe rainbow lorikeet was accidentally released into the southwest of Western Australia near the University of Western Australia in the 1960s, and they have since been classified as a pest.\nA feral population of rainbow lorikeets was established in New Zealand after an Auckland resident illegally released many rainbow lorikeets in the area in the 1990s, which started breeding in the wild. The Department of Conservation was concerned that rainbow lorikeets would outcompete native honeyeaters. They could also be a possible threat to nearby islands like the Little Barrier Island. They began killing the feral population in 2000.\nMany owners of fruit orchards think of rainbow lorikeets as a pest, as they often fly in groups and take fresh fruit from trees. In urban areas, the birds create nuisance noise and poop on outdoor areas and vehicles.\nIn Western Australia, the rainbow lorikeet competes with native bird species. This includes domination of food sources and competition for scarce nesting hollows. Different types of birds such as the purple-crowned lorikeet, the Carnaby's black cockatoo, and the Australian ringneck are affected."}

In the book, Pogge says that the poorest 46 percent of people have 1.2 percent of global income, and 826 million of them do not have enough to eat. One-third of all human deaths are from poverty-related causes: 18 million annually, including 12 million children under five.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the 15 percent of people in the developed countries have 80 percent of global income. Pogge says that shifting 1 or 2 percent of our share toward poverty eradication seems morally compelling. Yet most of the rich people believe that they have no such responsibility."}

He broke with the positivist orientation of the science and philosophy of his time, believing that experience is the source of all knowledge.\nHusserl studied mathematics under Karl Weierstra\u00df, completing a Ph.D. under Leo K\u00f6nigsberger, and studied philosophy under Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf.\nThen Husserl taught philosophy, as a \"Privatdozent\" at Halle from 1887, and as a professor:\nBiography.\nEducation and early works.\nHusserl was born into a Jewish family in a town that was then in the Austrian Empire (after 1918 a part of Czechoslovakia, and since 1993 a part of the Czech Republic). He became a member of the Lutheran Church in 1886.\nHe initially studied mathematics but then started attending lectures on psychology and philosophy. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy.\nHis major written work is \"Philosophie der Arithmetik\" (1891). In these first works he tries to combine mathematics, psychology and philosophy with a main goal to provide a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects. From Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between \"proper\" and \"improper\" presenting.\nIn an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also calls it) if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. \nAnother important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is intentionality, the notion that the main characteristic of consciousness is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as \"aboutness\" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of \"mental phenomena\", by which they could be distinguished from \"physical phenomena\".\nThe elaboration of phenomenology.\nSome years after the publication of his main work, the \"Logische Untersuchungen\" (\"Logical Investigations\"; 1900-1901) Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the object-in-itself, transcendent to consciousness). \nKnowledge of essences would only be possible by \"bracketing\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. He called this procedure \"epoch\u00e9\".\nHusserl then started to concentrate on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness.\nThe metaphysical problem of establishing what kind of reality we perceive was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a transcendental idealist.\nHusserl proposed that the world of objects and ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects is normally conceived of in what he called the \"natural standpoint\", which is characterized by a belief that objects materially exist and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them.\nHusserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually \" \"constitute\" \" them (to be distinguished from materially \" \"creating objects or objects\" \".\nIn a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of intersubjectivity, specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (\"Cartesian Meditations\", Meditation V).\nHusserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of phenomenology to scientific observation: specifically he refers to psychology) and what he means for \"bracketing natural attitude\".\n\"The Crisis of the European Sciences\" is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of Western philosophy and science, emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) empirical and naturalistic orientation.\nHusserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis.\nList of works.\nIn English.\nAnthologies:"}
