In it a British journalist called Martin Bashir asked Jackson questions. The movie was made between May 2002 and January 2003. It was shown first in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2003 on ITV. More than 15 million people watched it. It was shown in the United States on 6 February 2003 on ABC. 38 million people watched it. \n\"Living with Michael Jackson\" starts at Jackson's Neverland Ranch. They go to the Giving Tree. This is a tree where Jackson got inspiration for his songs.\nThere was a confidentiality agreement. This meant that Jackson did not talk about the 1993 child molestation allegations against him in the movie.\nIn the programme Jackson told Bashir that he had \"slept in a bed with many children\". He said that this was a \"beautiful thing\" and was not sexual. He held hands with a 12-year-old boy. Martin Bashir said that Neverland Ranch was a \"dangerous place for children\". After the programme was shown Thomas W. Sneddon started a criminal investigation about Jackson. Gavin Arvizo, the boy who Jackson held hands with in the movie, said that Jackson hebephilically molested him when he was 13 years old, after the documentary was on television. In 2005 the People v. Jackson trial began. After four months Jackson was found not guilty of all 10 charges.\nOn 23 February 2003 \"The Michael Jackson Interview: The Footage You Were Never Meant to See\" was shown on Fox. In it there were interviews with people who were not in \"Living with Michael Jackson\". These included Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe. In the video Bashir also said that he thinks it is wonderful that Jackson allows children to come to Neverland.\nJackson's lawyers wrote to the Independent Television Commission and the Broadcasting Standards Commission saying that he was \"unfairly treated\"."}

Radical feminists are sometimes called 'radfems'. Famous radical feminists include Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon, Valerie Solanas,and Alice Walker. Radical feminists say that society is a patriarchy. In patriarchy, men have more social power than women. They harm women by oppressing them. Liberal feminists want to be equal to men. Radical feminists do not want equality within the patriarchy, but they want to get rid of patriarchy entirely. This is so that women will not be oppressed. This is different than , who think that women's oppression is caused by economic conflict, not patriarchy. Radical feminism says that , BDSM, and gender roles should not exist, because they are part of the patriarchy. Radical feminists do not believe in buying and selling sex acts, which is called prostitution. Radical feminists also believe in ending rape and domestic violence.\nHistory.\nIn 1967 a group called New York Radical Women was started by Carol Hanisch, Shulamith Firestone and Robin Morgan. They were a group of who were unhappy with being ignored by civil rights and antiwar groups that were led by men.\nIn September 1968 they did a protest at the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. They put symbols of female oppression including bras, copies of \"Playboy\" magazine, and girdles in a trash can. \nIn 1969 New York Radical Women broke up. A new radical feminist group called Redstockings was started in 1969 by Ellen Willis and Shulamith Firestone.\nIn the 1980s the Feminist Sex Wars happened. The Feminist Sex Wars were fights between radical feminists who said that porn, sex work, and BDSM are bad, and sex positive liberal feminists, who said that those things can be feminist. Radical feminism is associated with the second wave of feminism. This ended in the 1990s. Since then radical feminism has been less popular. The third wave of feminism is liberal. Some of the women who started radical feminism have died. However, radical feminism still has influence. In 2012 a book by Julia Long, \"Anti-Porn: The Resurgence of Anti-Pornography Feminism\" was published.\nCriticism.\nIn 1979 \"The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male\", a book by a radical feminist called Janice Raymond, was published. In the book Raymond said that trans women all \"rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves.\" The RadFem2012 conference would not let in transgender women. Radical feminists may call themselves 'transcritical' or 'gender-critical'.\nAnother reason people do not like radical feminism is because they may think radical feminists are \"man-haters\". This is because of an author named Valerie Solanas. In 1967 Valerie Solanas wrote the SCUM Manifesto. SCUM was Society for Cutting Up Men. She wrote in it that women should get rid of the male sex. Solanas tried to kill Andy Warhol. She also shot Mario Amaya.\nRadical feminism has been criticized for being anti-sex. An example of this is the work of Andrea Dworkin. Andrea Dworkin published a book in 1987 called \"Intercourse\". In the book she wrote about how heterosexual sex and pornography is oppressive to women. It is often thought that \"Intercourse\" argues that \"all heterosexual sex is rape\" even though Andrea Dworkin did not say this. Dworkin wrote two books against pornography, \"Pornography - Men Possessing Women\" and \"Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality\".\nRadical feminists have been criticized by sex workers who do not want to lose their jobs. Sex workers may disagree with radical feminists who say that if you are paid to have sex then it is rape. Anti sex work radical feminists are sometimes called SWERFs (Sex Work Exclusionary Radical Feminists)."}

He also played a role in the discovery of the cold-producing adenoviruses, the hepatitis viruses, and the cancer-causing virus SV40.\nHe is credited with saving more lives than any other medical scientist of the 20th century. Robert Gallo described him as \"the most successful vaccinologist in history\".\nAt the time of his death on April 11, 2005, at the age of 85, Hilleman was Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\nMethod and personality.\nHilleman was a forceful man who was at the same time modest in his claims.

That is why Korean masks normally represent the face of demons or monsters that cause various diseases. Ancient Korean believed that the mask of strong demons can drive weak demons out. \nMasks in theatre.\nMask plays have different themes. Basic themes are biting satire, ritual dances, exorcism rites, parody of human weaknesses, social evils and the privileged class. \nA lot of \"talchum\", or plays, mock stereotyped of annoying personalities in the lower classes. The most distinguishing feature of the Korea mask plays is variations of specific lines in plays. According to actors and regions, the specific lines in plays can be changed. With regional variations, the mask play is usually performed on traditional holidays. \nShamanistic masks.\nKorean masks used in shamanistic practices were made of wood. They had several coasts of lacquer to give the masks gloss and to and waterproof them for wearing. In Korea, many people have believed that the lacquer tree can drive away evil spirits. That is why Koreans used lacquered masks. The horrifying or grotesque masks were used in shamanistic practices for their ability to evoke fear, and humor, in ceremonial rites."}

Planets, stars, galaxies, and other outer space objects may be viewed and recorded. This category does not include observatories in space which are pointed toward the earth for the purpose of reconnaissance, meteorology and other types of information gathering.\nAll observation of space from Earth is filtered through the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere filters and distorts what is seen and recorded. \nSatellite-based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes. Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere blurs images taken by ground-based telescopes, an effect known as seeing. It is this effect that makes stars \"twinkle\" in the sky. As a result, the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light (for example, by the Hubble Space Telescope) are much clearer than Earth-based telescopes, even though Earth-based telescopes are very large.\nSpace-based astronomy is vital for frequency ranges outside the optical and radio windows. For example, X-ray astronomy is nearly impossible when done from the Earth. It has reached its present importance in astronomy due to orbiting X-ray telescopes. Infrared and ultraviolet are also largely blocked by the atmosphere. Most space observatories are in low Earth orbit.\nHistory.\nIn 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer was the first to propose a telescope in outer space, a decade before the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, \"Sputnik\".\nSpitzer said a large telescope in space, above the Earth's atmosphere, would see better. His efforts resulted in the world's first space-based optical telescope, \"Hubble Space Telescope\", which was launched on April 20, 1990 by the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" (STS-31)."}

By the first half of the first millennium BC it was already dividing into separate dialects or languages. There is some evidence that the Pictish language may have had close ties to Common Brittonic and might be a fifth branch.\nEvidence from Welsh shows a great influence from Latin on Common Brittonic during the Roman period. This is particularly true of the Church and Christianity, which are nearly all Latin derivatives. Common Brittonic was replaced in most of Scotland by Gaelic. South of the Firth of Forth it was replaced by Old English (which later developed into Scots). Common Brittonic survived into the Middle Ages in Southern Scotland and Cumbria. Common Brittonic was gradually replaced by English throughout England. In the north of England, Cumbric disappeared as late as the 13th century.

These were: Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex and Wessex. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms eventually became the Kingdom of England. The term has been in use since the 16th century. It is used to apply both to the seven kingdoms and to the time period in which they existed.\nOrigins of the heptarchy.\nThe idea of a heptarchy, a group of seven independent kingdoms, is thought to have come from the English historian Henry of Huntingdon in the 12th century. He listed the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in his \"Historia Anglorum\" (History of the English People). Bede, however, set up the idea that several kingdoms were more dominant than others (at different times). He created a list of kings who dominated the other kingdoms. The dividing line between these kingdoms was the River Humber. Northumbria (Deira and Bernicia) was the northern kingdom while the remaining kingdoms were those of the southern English. The actual term 'heptarchy' was first used in the 16th century by William Lambarde. His 1568 woodcut map is the earliest known use of the term.\nThe term heptarchy is sometimes used to imply a between the kingdoms that did not exist. From the 6th century to the 9th century these were simply seven kingdoms set up by the Germanic invaders and their descendants. There was little equality between them. Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex were the most powerful of the seven and often dominated the others. The kingdoms were gradually reduced in number. The heptarchy basically ended with the coming of the Vikings. The term heptarchy was popular among scholars from the 16th to the 19th centuries but is occasionally used today.\nBretwaldas.\nOriginally Bede listed seven kings who held authority over the other kingdoms in England at the time. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle lists the eighth bretwalda:\nTwo Mercian kings of the 8th century can be considered bretwaldas also:\nKingdoms of the Heptarchy.\nThe seven kingdoms were:"}

He was a libertarian. In 1961 Szasz's third and most well known book, \"The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct\", was published. Szasz died when he was 92.\nEarly life.\nSzasz was born in Budapest in Hungary to Jewish parents. He grew up speaking German and Hungarian. He also spoke French. In 1938 Szasz moved with his family to the United States. He studied medicine at the University of Cincinnati. However, he was more interested in politics and philosophy. In 1956 Szasz became a professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York in Syracuse.\nSzasz's arguments.\nSzasz was a heretic in psychiatry. This means that his opinions were very different to the ideas generally accepted within psychiatry. He said that psychiatry is a pseudoscience. He compared it to religion. In \"Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry\", Szasz argued that schizophrenia is a symbol that is 'worshipped' by psychiatrists in the same way that Christians worship Christ. He said that mental illness is not an illness of the brain but \"problems of living\". People described Szasz as being 'anti psychiatry'. In response to this Szasz wrote a book called \"Antipsychiatry: Quackery Squared\". He believed that mental hospitals are like prisons.\nHe argued that \"death control\", or the right to killing oneself, is a human right like birth control. However, he was against euthanasia by the state. Szasz did not believe that drug addiction is a disease. Instead, he thought that it is a social habit. He thought that drugs should be made legal.\nSzasz was an atheist."}

Windsor was a court case heard by the United States Supreme Court. The court's decision was historically important for marriage law in the U.S. It was also important for LGBT rights.\nThe court decided that defining \"marriage\" as a union between one man and one woman (as husband and wife) was unconstitutional (against the Constitution). This specifically related to Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law passed in 1996. This defined \"marriage\" for federal (national) law in the United States. It defined it as being between one man and one woman. In \"United States v. Windsor\", the court decided that this definition was against the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In the U.S., the Constitution protects the rights of citizens, and no individual law can take those rights away.\nThe basis for the case was the right to benefits for same-sex married couples; the same right held by heterosexual married couples. Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, a same-sex couple living in New York, were married in Canada in 2007. Spyer died in 2009, leaving everything she owned to Windsor. Under the law, widows do not have to pay tax on anything they inherited from their dead spouse. Windsor tried to claim this exemption. She was barred from doing so by Section 3 of DOMA, which said that the word \"spouse\" only applies to a marriage between a man and woman. The Internal Revenue Service denied Windsor's claim, and demanded that she pay $363,053 in inheritance taxes.\nAfter Windsor won the case, \"Time\" magazine named her the third most influential person of the year in 2013."}

Kings of Essex frequently found themselves under the control of other Anglo-Saxon overlords. The territory of the East Saxons included the two Roman provincial capitals of Colchester and, for a time, London. In the Tribal Hidage the East Saxons were listed at 7,000 hides. \nHistory.\nWhen they arrived in England the Saxons, like the Angles, Jutes and Frisians, were Pagans. After the Saxons gained control of Kent they set themselves up in the territory of Essex. The first attempts to convert the East Saxons to Christianity came in 604 with the arrival of Bishop (later Saint) Mellitus in London. Athelberht (King of Kent was the overlord of southern England and helped in the conversion of King Saebert of Essex. Athelberht built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral now stands. After the death of Saebert in 616, Mellitus was driven out and the kingdom reverted to paganism. King Oswi of Northumbria convinced King Sigebert of Essex to become Christian. Sigebert then invited Chad to become Bishop of London. By 874 the Great Heathen Army held much of Essex. They established bases from which they attacked other parts of England. In 825 the kingdom of the East Saxons became part of Wessex. "}

He was the head of Yukos, one of the largest Russian companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets in the 1990s.\nHe was arrested on 25 October 2003. The government under Vladimir Putin then froze shares of Yukos shortly thereafter on tax charges. The state took further actions against Yukos, leading to a collapse of the company's share price. This destroyed most of Khodorkovsky's wealth. He was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison in May 2005. While still serving his sentence, Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were further charged and found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering in December 2010, extending his prison sentence to 2014.\nKhodorkovsky was pardoned by President Vladimir Putin following lobbying for his release by Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and released from jail on 20 December 2013.\nTrial.\nThere is widespread concern internationally that the trials and sentencing were politically motivated. During Putin's presidency, it became clear that many state assets had been sold far below their true value. This was shown as soon as shares became available on the open market. The conspiracy theory is that, wanting to recapture Yukos for the state, a way was sought to put an end to Khodorovsky's control.\nThere was a confrontation between state auditors and Yukos auditors as to the extent of Yukos' profits. It was claimed for Yukos that a large part of the profits were covered by investments in plant (pipelines, etc.), and exploration. The upshot was that Khodorovsky was charged with tax evasion.\nThe trial process was criticised abroad for its lack of due process. Khodorkovsky lodged several applications to the European Court of Human Rights. In response to his first application, which concerned events from 2003 to 2005, the court found that several violations were committed by the Russian authorities in their treatment of Khodorkovsky. In particular, the court ruled that Khodorkovsky's arrest was \"unlawful as it had been made with a purpose different from the one expressed.\" Despite these findings, the court ultimately ruled that the trial was not politically motivated, but rather \"that the charges against him were grounded in 'reasonable suspicion'\"."}

In both situations, the homeowner is at least several months behind on payments. In a foreclosure, the bank or lending institution seizes the house, and they now own it and have to try to sell it themselves (or through an agency). In a short sale, the homeowner agrees with the bank to sell it for less than it is worth on the market. The banks would maybe agree to this because it means the house will get sold, saving them the selling responsibility. But they are losing money, because the house is selling for less than it is worth. Sometimes, they make the homeowner pay the balance, and sometimes they forgive it.\nShort sales are not always a great deal because of the highly inflated prices of the housing bubble. For example, if a house that normally costs $100,000 was suddenly 'valued' at $200,000, and someone got a loan for that amount, they would want to re-sell it for $200,000 or even more to make a profit. However, values dropped. So now, they may short sell (less than it is worth) the house for $175,000, and lose $25,000. But to a new buyer, that $100,000 house is probably still not worth $175,000. So see what the average is for that house over time."}

In 604 he conquered Deira and became the first King of Northumbria. Aethelfrith was the first great leader among the Angles north of the River Humber. Bede called him an ambitious and powerful king who cruelly ravaged the Britons more than any other English leader. He was killed in battle against the East Angles.\nKing of Bernicia.\nAthelfrith was the son of Athelric of Bernicia and grandson of Ida of Bernicia. In 593 Athelfrith became King of Bernicia. According to Frank Stenton \"The continuous history of Northumbria, and indeed of England, begins with the reign of Athelfrith...\" Among the northern Angles, Aethelfrith was the first great leader. He gained more territory from the Britons than any other English leader.\nIn 595 a large force of Britons, and Picts came together at \"Din Eydin\" (Edinburgh). They attacked the Angles of Bernicia at a place identified as Catterick. Among those killed at this battle called \"Catraeth\", was Owen of Rheged, Athelfrith's enemy. Owen had killed Athelfrith's father, Athelric. The remaining force of Britons, Gaels and Picts was completely defeated, most of them being killed. In 603 Athelfrith fought another great battle at a place called \"Degsastan.\" D\u00e1l Riatan Scots, under their king Aedan mac Gabrain came against the English and were completely defeated. Athelfrith's victory eliminated the Scots as a threat for a long period of time in northern Britain. Bede, writing in 731, wrote that up to his day no king of the Scots had attempted to wage war against the northern English again. The only remaining enemy to cause Athelfrith any concern was the Britons of Strathclyde.\nKing of Northumbria.\nIn 604 Athelfrith attacked Deira to his south. King Athelric of Deira was killed. Athelfrith also tried to kill Edwin of Deira, Athelric's brother, but Edwin escaped. He took Edwin's sister, Achaas, as his second wife. In 605 Athelfrith united the two kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira, into a single kingdom called Northumbria. He must have spent the next few years setting up ways to govern such a large territory. He almost certainly set up fortifications as well. By 613 Athelfrith began trying to capture Edwin who had since been in exile in Gwnedd and Powys. He moved his army across the Pennines to Chester. When several monks were sent by the Britons to negotiate with Athelfrith they were killed. Between 613 and 616 Athelfrith defeated the Britons in battle at Chester. Edwin escaped again this time to Mercia, then to East Anglia. Athelfrith wanted the king, Raedwald of East Anglia, to murder Edwin, but he would not. Concerned that Athelfrith might attack East Anglia, Raedwald took his army and attacked Athelfrith. The two armies met at the River Idle near Doncaster. Not seeing the East Angles as a major threat, Athelfrith brought a smaller army. Athelfrith was killed after he was separated from his bodyguards. Edwin returned to Northumbria to become the king. At Athelfrith's death his family fled north to find safety. Eanfrith, the eldest son, found safety with the Picts. He married the sister of Gartnait, King of the Picts. His Oswald and Oswiu found safety with the Scots in Argyll.\nFamily.\nAthelfrith took a British or Pictish wife named Bebbe. The Bernician royal city of Bamburgh is named for her.

Beginning in the early 5th century D\u00e1l Riata covered the area of what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland. They came from the area of County Antrim in Northern Ireland where they were called 'Scots'. Other groups from Ireland followed. These groups also established themselves on the west coast as far south as Cornwall. The colony from Irish D\u00e1l Riata were known as the \"Scotti\" to the Romans. It was this group that later gave their name to Scotland.\nHistory.\nAt the time they began to colonize D\u00e1l Riata, the only other people living in the far north of Britain were the Picts. They occupied the eastern part of Scotland north of what is now Edinburgh. About A.D. 297 they were mentioned by Roman writers regarding an attack along Hadrian's Wall. Even at this early period the Romans encountered Irish \"Scotti\" assisting the Picts even though they had not yet moved there permanently. So the two groups were seen by the Romans to be allies. How D\u00e1l Riata in Scotland was seen as a colony still controlled from Ireland is not clear to modern historians. \nSome view the D\u00e1l Riatans as having their own local kings with their overlord in Ireland. Others saw it as being ruled by one king. D\u00e1l Riata became the home of the Irish monk Saint Columba. He established a Christian community on the isle of Iona. He brought Christianity to the whole of Scotland, Gaels and Picts. \nThe kingdom rose to power under their king Aedan mac Gabrain. He became their king in 574. In 603 Aedan led his people against Athelfrith of Bernicia at a place called \"Degsastan.\" The Scots were completely defeated. Defeats in Ireland and Scotland during the reign of Domnall Brecc (d. 642) ended D\u00e1l Riata's dominance. The kingdom came under the control of Northumbria, then subject to the Picts. The kingdom's independence ended in the Viking Age, as it merged with the lands of the Picts to form the Kingdom of Alba.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It is the fifth brightest star in the night sky and the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. At only 25 light-years from Earth, it is a relatively close star and one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.\nVega has been extensively studied by astronomers: this led it to be called \"arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun\". \nVega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the astronomical brightness scale.\nVega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun. Both stars are at present near the midpoint of their life expectancies. \nVega has not much of the elements heavier than helium. Vega is a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner. It is spinning rapidly with a velocity of 274\u00a0km/s at the equator. This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.\nBased on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation, Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting disk of debris, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega-like stars. Irregularities in Vega's disk also suggest the presence of at least one planet, likely to be about the size of Jupiter."}

In 1920 the first vocal blues recording, \"Crazy Blues\", was made by the Vaudevillean singer Mamie Smith. After this blues sung by African American females became popular. The most popular female blues singer was Bessie Smith. She was a big influence on other jazz singers. She sung a song called \"Squeeze Me\" that was composed by Fats Waller. In 1921 Black Swan Records was started in Harlem. It was the first record label owned by an African-American. In December 1928 Pinetop Smith recorded \"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\". The song influenced the boogie-woogie style of music. In the late 1920s the trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong became one of the most famous jazz musicians in the world.\n1930s.\nIn the early 30s swing music developed. In the late 1930s people were worried that barbershop music would die out, and there was a barbershop music revival. 1935-1946 is known as the swing era. At this time it was the most popular music in America. Big bands played swing music.\n1940s.\nR&amp;B music began in the 1940s. Until 1948 it was called \"race music\". In 1949, the term \"Rhythm and Blues\" replaced the \"Billboard\" category Harlem Hit Parade. The trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie helped create the first modern jazz style, bebop. In the 1940s the jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday became popular.\n1950s.\nIn 1955 the single \"Tutti Frutti\" was released by Little Richard. It sold over a million copies. He was one of the first black musicians to be popular among both white and black people. Little Richard called himself the \"king of rockin' and rollin', rhythm and blues soulin'\". People have described \"Tutti Frutti\" as being the song that began rock and roll. Singer and guitarist Chuck Berry also helped to make rock and roll with songs like \"Maybelline\". Big Mama Thornton was the first person to sing \"Hound Dog\" in 1952. It was number one on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts in 1953 for seven weeks. It sold nearly two million copies. However, in 1956 Elvis Presley, a white singer, sung the song and was more successful. It sold 10 million copies. Presley was very influenced by African-American music. He made rockabilly, a kind of rock and roll, popular. Some black people say that Presley was nothing more than a racist white Southerner who stole black music.\nJames Brown became popular towards the end of the decade. He helped create funk music. Gospel began its golden age after World War II. In the 1950s soul music also started to appear. Etta James and Clyde McPhatter contributed to the creation of soul. Soul was a kind of non religious gospel music. Soul and R&amp;B influenced the sound of girl groups, only some of which were white.\nA type of jazz called free jazz started to develop.

One of the pair, UV Ceti, was the archetype for the class of flare stars.\nThe star system was discovered in 1948 by W.J Luyten in the course of compiling a catalogue of stars of high proper motion; he noted its exceptionally high proper motion of 3.37 arc seconds annually and catalogued it as Luyten 726-8.\nThe two stars are of nearly equal brightness, with apparent magnitudes of 12.57 and 11.99 as seen from Earth. They orbit one another every 26.5 years. The distance between the two stars varies from 2.1 to 8.8 AU. Its own nearest neighbour is Tau Ceti, away from it.\nBoth the stars are variables. The most spectacular is Luyten 726-8B, which was given the variable star designation UV Ceti (the other star is also known as BL Ceti). Although UV Ceti was not the first flare star discovered, it is the most prominent example of such a star, and similar flare stars are now known as UV Ceti type variable stars. This star goes through fairly extreme changes of brightness: for instance, in 1952, its brightness increased by 75 times in only 20 seconds. UV Ceti is a red dwarf of spectral type M6.0e."}

The distances given by these three independent methods make the Hyades an important rung on the cosmic distance ladder. \nThe cluster consists of a roughly spherical group of hundreds of stars sharing the same age, place of origin, chemical content, and motion through space. From the perspective of observers on Earth, the Hyades cluster is in the constellation Taurus, where its brightest stars form a \"V\" shape with the even brighter red giant Aldebaran. Aldebaran is completely unrelated to the Hyades, because it is much closer to Earth (hence its apparent brightness) and just happens to lie along the same line of sight.\nThe four brightest member stars of the Hyades are all red giants that began life as A-type stars and have now evolved off the main sequence. All are within a few light years of each other. Their Bayer designations are Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Theta Tauri. They form a pattern which was identified as the head of Taurus the Bull. Epsilon Tauri, also known as Ain (the \"Bull's Eye\"), harbours at least one gas giant planet.\nThe age of the Hyades is about 625 million years. The cluster core, where stars are most densely packed, has a radius of 2.7 parsecs (corresponding to a diameter of 17.6 light years), and the cluster's tidal radius is 10 parsecs (corresponding to a diameter of 65 light years).

It is in the Milky Way galaxy, about 3.5\u20135 kiloparsecs (12000\u201316000 light years) away from Earth.\nIt is the most massive compact young star cluster known in the entire Local Group of galaxies. It was discovered by Bengt Westerlund in 1961. It remained largely unstudied for many years due to high interstellar extinction (absorption) in its direction. In the future, it will probably evolve into a globular cluster.\nThe cluster contains a large number of rare, evolved, high-mass stars, including: six yellow hypergiants, four red supergiants, 24 Wolf-Rayet stars, a luminous blue variable, many OB supergiants, and an unusual supergiant sgB[e] star which may be the remnant of a recent stellar merger. In addition, X-ray observations have revealed the presence of a strange X-ray pulsar, a slow rotating neutron star that must have formed from a high-mass progenitor star. Westerlund 1 is believed to have formed in a single burst of star formation, so the stars have similar ages and compositions.\nApart from hosting some of the most massive and least-understood stars in the galaxy, Westerlund 1 is useful as an example of a relatively nearby, so easier to observe, super star cluster to help astronomers find out what happens in extragalactic super star clusters.\nDistance and position.\nWd1 is too far away for direct measurement of the distance by parallax measurements, so the distance must be got from the expected absolute magnitude of the stars and estimates of the extinction towards the cluster. This has been done, giving estimates of 5\u00a0kpc and 3.6\u00a0kpc by different methods. These estimates all place Wd1 near the outer edge of the Milky Way's galactic bar."}

It had many fenestrae (openings) and thin bones. It had a wide muzzle filled with more than 500 teeth. They were replaced often: about every 14 days the whole set were replaced together. The jaws may have had a keratinous sheath, something like a wide beak. Its jaws were wider than the skull, and its teeth were placed far to the front.\n\"Nigersaurus\" was long, which is small for a sauropod, and had a short neck. It weighed around 4 tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant. Its skeleton was filled with air sacs, which lightened the weight. Its limbs were robustly built.\n\"Nigersaurus\" was probably a browser, and fed with its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was small, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat (near rivers).

The term egocentrism was mostly coined by Piaget, a psychologist. Egocentrism is different from both egoism and narcissism.

Developing self-conscience requires the perception that there are others, that there is socialistion with other people, and that there are differences between oneself and other people. Egocentric people are often unable to fully understand or to cope with other people's opinions. The fact that reality can be different from what they are ready to accept is difficult for them. "}

When Columba arrived with twelve monks in 563 he founded a great monastery. From that time Iona was known as a holy place. It was the center of Scottish Christianity for many centuries. Today it is a popular tourist attraction and a place for retreats. Its modern Gaelic name means \"Iona of (Saint) Columba\" (formerly anglicised \"Icolmkill\").\nThe village.\nThe main settlement, located at St. Ronan's Bay on the eastern side of the island, is called \"Baile M\u00f2r\". It is known locally as \"The Village\". The primary school, post office, the island's two hotels, the Bishop's House and the ruins of the Iona nunnery are here. The abbey and MacLeod Centre are a short walk to the north. There are a number of offshore Islands nearby. Eilean Annraidh (island of storm) and Eilean Chalbha (calf island) are larger islands to the north. R\u00e8idh Eilean and Stac MhicMhurchaidh Islands lay to the west of Iona. Eilean M\u00f9simul (mouse holm island) and Soa Island are to the south.\nHistory.\nD\u00e1l Riata.\nAt the start, Iona was a part of the Gaelic kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata. The island was the site of a highly important monastery during the Early Middle Ages. According to tradition the monastery was founded in 563 by the monk Columba, also known as Colm Cille, who had been exiled from his native Ireland. Columba and twelve companions went into exile on Iona and founded a monastery there. The monastery was very successful, and played a large part in the conversion of the Picts to Christianity. It also had an influence on the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Many other monasteries were founded in Scotland and Iona became the center of a great monastic system. The scriptorium produced many very important documents.\nChristian center.\nThe monastery itself became the center of Celtic Christianity. Iona was a major supporter of the \"Celtic\" system for calculating the date of Easter. The missionaries and bishops who came to Britain from Rome used a Roman calculation for the date of Easter. This issue was settled when they adopted the Roman system at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Pictland adopted the Roman system in the early 8th century. Iona changed systems in 716, according to the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede. Iona's prominence was reduced over the next centuries as a result of Viking raids and the rise of other powerful monasteries in the system, such as the Abbey of Kells. The Book of Kells was created on Iona about the year 800. At about the same time the island's high crosses were erected. They had a ring around the top part that became the symbol called a \"Celtic cross\". The series of Viking raids on Iona began in 794 and, after its treasures had been plundered many times, Columba's relics were removed and divided two ways between Scotland and Ireland in 849 as the monastery was abandoned.\nKingdom of the Isles.\nAs the Viking control of the west coast of Scotland advanced, Iona became part of the Kingdom of the Isles. Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n, King of Northumbria and Dublin, died in 981 while on Iona. Still, the island was sacked twice by his successors. On Christmas night 986 and again in 987. The ruling dynasty of Alba traced its origin to Iona, and the island thus became an important religious icon of the new kingdom. Many of its early kings are buried there. The kings of the Isles were at times vassals of the King of Norway, High King of Ireland, or the King of Scotland. By the 11th century they were nominally attached to the Kingdom of Norway, but in reality they were independent.\nA convent for Benedictine nuns was established in about 1208, with Beth\u00f3c, daughter of Somerled, as first prioress. The present Benedictine abbey, Iona Abbey, was built in about 1203. The monastery itself flourished until the Reformation when buildings were demolished and all but three of the 360 carved crosses destroyed.\nKingdom of Scotland.\nAccording to tradition, the first \"King of Scots\" was Kenneth MacAlpin (Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn). He founded the beginnings of what we know as Scotland in 843. The Reilig Cemetery on Iona was from that time until the 11th century the place where Scottish kings were buried. In total there are about forty-eight Scottish kings buried at Iona. In addition, eight kings of Norway and four kings of Ireland are buried on Iona.\nFollowing the 1266 Treaty of Perth the Isles (Hebrides) were restored to Scottish rule. An Augustine nunnery survives as a number of 13th century ruins, including a church and cloister. The nunnery continued to be active until the Reformation. By the 1760s little more of the nunnery remained standing than at present, though it is the most complete remnant of a medieval nunnery in Scotland.\nIn the 19th century green-streaked marble was commercially mined in the south-east of Iona; the quarry and machinery survive."}

She was also an East Anglian princess and Abbess of Ely.\nLife.\nAethelthryth was born in East Anglia (now Suffolk). She was one of the four daughters of Anna of East Anglia. All of these women became nuns and founded abbeys.\nShe was a beautiful young girl who wanted to devote herself to the Church and took a vow to remain a virgin. When the \"\" Tondberht of the South Gyrwas. asked for her hand in marriage her parents said yes, but Aethelthryth refused. Though she was married she resolved to keep her solomn vow. Upon his death in 655, she retired to the Isle of Ely, which she had received from her husband as a gift.\nAethelthryth was then married to Ecgfrith of Northumbria in 660. Ecgfrith was a younger son of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his wife Enfleda. Shortly after Ecgfrith became king, Aethelthryth asked her husband if she could become a nun. She was encouraged by Bishop Wilfrid to remain . This caused friction between Ecgfrith and Bishop Wilfrid. One story tells that Ecgfrith first agreed that she should continue to remain a virgin but in about 672 he wished to have an heir. He tried to bribe Wilfrid to convince the queen to give him an heir. This failed and the king tried to take his queen from her convent. She fled back to Ely with two nuns and managed to evade capture. The legend says that she escaped due to the miraculous rising of the tide. Another version of the legend stated that she stopped on the journey at 'Stow' and hid under an ash tree which suddenly came from her staff after she planted it in the ground. This came to be known as 'St Aethelthryth 's Stow', when a church was built to commemorate this event. Stow Minster contains a stained glass window that portrays the legend. Ecgfrith later married Eormenburg and expelled Wilfrid from his kingdom in 678. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", Aethelthryth founded a double monastery at Ely in 673, which was later destroyed in the Danish invasion of 870. She lived at St. Ely for the remainder of her life in pious devotion. She died of the plague. There is a hymn that was written in her honor.\nAethelthryth's niece and her great-niece, both of whom were royal princesses, succeeded her as abbess of Ely.\nBede and The \"Liber Eliensis\" describe how in 695, Aethelthryth's body was dug up by her sister Seaxburth, to be transferred from a common grave to the new church at Ely. She had been dead sixteen years. When her body was exhumed it was said to have been just as it was when she was alive. She was reburied in a white, marble coffin. Aethelthryth's uncorrupted body and clothes were said to have miraculous powers. A burial chamber made of white marble was taken from the Roman ruins at Grantchester, which was found to be the right fit for Aethelthryth. Seaxburh supervised the preparation of her sister's body, which was washed and wrapped in new robes before being reburied. Seaxburgh apparently oversaw the transference of her sister's remains without the supervision of her bishop, using her knowledge gained from her family's links.\nSt Etheldreda's Church is dedicated to the saint. It was originally part of the palace of the Bishops of Ely. In later years the palace was used by the Spanish Ambassadors, enabling Roman Catholic worship to continue in the church. It is now a Roman Catholic parish church in Ely, Cambridgeshire. It is part of the Diocese of East Anglia within the Province of Westminster. The church contains the shrine and relics of Aethelthryth."}

This faint galaxy is well studied by professional astronomers, who are interested in the history of star formation in the galaxy. The galaxy is relatively nearby, so the Hubble Space Telescope can easily pick out its stars. In 2008 scientists studying images from Hubble calculated the galaxy's distance at nearly 11 million light-years away, making it a member of the IC 342 group of galaxies.\nStarburst.\nThe most notable feature of NGC 1569 is its powerful starburst. It has formed stars at a rate 100 times greater than that of our galaxy during the last 100 million years. It contains two prominent super star clusters with different histories.\nSuper star cluster A, in the northwest of the galaxy is formed of two close clusters (\"NGC 1569 A1\" and \"NGC 1569 A2\"). It contains young stars \n(including WolfRayet stars) which formed less than 5 million years ago (in \"NGC 1569 A1\") as \nwell as older red stars (in \"NGC 1569 A2\").\nSuper star cluster B, near the center of the galaxy, has older red giants and red supergiants.\nBoth of these star clusters have masses similar to the globular clusters in the Milky Way. Many smaller star clusters are relatively young (between 2 million years and 1 billion years. They are similar to small globular clusters or R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nThis shows, with the results from other dwarf galaxies such as the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC 1705, that star formation in dwarf galaxies does not occur continuously but instead occurs in a series of short bursts.\nThe many supernovae produced in the galaxy as well as the strong stellar winds of its stars have produced filaments and bubbles of ionized hydrogen with respective sizes of up to 3,700 and 380 light years. These shine as the light of the young stars contained within them hits the gas.\nNGC 1569's starburst may have been triggered by interactions with other galaxies of the IC 342 group, probably a nearby cloud of hydrogen."}

Alford", "text": "Frederick Joseph Ricketts (21 February 1881 \u2013 15 May 1945) was a British composer of marches for band. He wrote music under the pen name Kenneth J. Alford. He was a Bandmaster in the British Army, and Royal Marines Director of Music. Conductor Sir Vivian Dunn called him \"The British March King.\" Ricketts frequently used the saxophone in his music. This led to the instrument being used in all military bands.\nEarly life.\nRicketts was born on 21 February 1881. He was the 4th child of Robert and Louisa (n\u00e9e Alford) Ricketts, who lived in London. Ricketts' father died when he was seven and his mother died when he was fourteen. His early musical training had been on playing the piano and organ and working as a church chorister. As a boy living in London\u2019s East End he would often hear street musicians and bands. He decided that joining an army band would be best for his future.\nEnlistment.\nRicketts joined the Royal Irish Regiment in 1895. He was enlisted as a Band Boy. He was a good cornet player and was put into the regimental band. The band went with the regiment to Limerick in Ireland, and then to India. In his free time, Ricketts learned all the other band instruments. When he was 15 years old, he wrote his first piece, which was called \"For Service Overseas\". It has never been published. In 1903, he was recommended for entry into the Student Bandmaster Course at the Royal Military School of Music, in Twickenham, Middlesex. Musicians who were as young as Ricketts were not nominated very often, but Ricketts was very skilled.\nRoyal Military School of Music.\nRicketts began a two-year course at Kneller Hall in the summer of 1904. This course was very difficult. He graduated in 1906.\nBandmaster.\nIn 1908, Ricketts became Bandmaster to the Band of the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He went to the Orange River Colony (formerly the Orange Free State) to lead them. This colony is now the Republic of South Africa. The colonel asked him to write a new march for the Argylls, so Ricketts wrote \"The Thin Red Line\". It was not published until 1925.\nRicketts wanted to compose music. However, it was not accepted for officers of Ricketts's rank to be engaged in commercial activities in the civilian world. Because of this, Ricketts decided to compose and publish under the pen name Kenneth J. Alford. The first march written under the new pen name was \"Holyrood\".\nFirst World War.\nA few weeks before the start of World War I, Ricketts composed his most famous march, called \"Colonel Bogey\". No one knows exactly how Ricketts began composing it. Ricketts's widow claims that it came from a game of golf. She says that during the game, Ricketts and another member of the Argylls started whistling the notes that would become the march's melody.\nShortly after World War I started, Ricketts and the Band Boys of the Argylls were sent to the 3rd Battalion (Reserve) in Edinburgh. They stayed there through the whole war. During the war Ricketts wrote several marches dedicated to the British military: \"The Great Little Army\" (1916), \"On The Quarter Deck,\" \"The Middy,\" \"The Voice of the Guns\" (1917), and \"The Vanished Army (They Never Die)\" (1919).\nFrom Army to Navy.\nIn 1921, Ricketts applied to become a bandmaster for the Band of the Plymouth Division, which was part of the Royal Marines. He was interviewed and was offered the position. However, the old bandmaster, P.S.G. O'Donnell, was trying to apply for a position with an Army band, but members of the Royal Marines were not allowed to become members of the British Army. Because of this, Ricketts could not take the position, since O'Donnell remained with the Band of the Plymouth Division.\nIn 1927, Ricketts applied again to become a bandmaster with the Royal Marines. This time, he was approved. He became a lieutenant in the Royal Marines Band Service on 4 July 1927. He was posted to the Band of the Marines' Depot at Deal in Kent. In 1930, Ricketts was posted to the Band of the Plymouth Division.\nPersonal life.\nOn 5 September 1907, Frederick Joseph Ricketts was married to Miss Annie Louisa Holmes. This was while he was on staff at the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall. Annie (Nan) Holmes came from a musical family. Her brother was a partner in the London music publishing house of Walsh, Holmes and Company. Nan often gave Ricketts ideas and helped him make decisions about compositions. They had six children, Kenneth (March 1909), Leo (April 1911), Sheila (May 1913), Paula (October 1916), Gordon (October 1918),and Jos\u00e9 (October 1922).\nDeath.\nRicketts retired from the Royal Marines on 1 June 1944 because of ill health. He died at his home in Reigate, Surrey, on 15 May 1945, after an operation for cancer. He had given almost 50 years of service to the Crown."}

He composed them between 1835 and 1842. The four ballades are said to have been inspired by Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. The exact inspiration for each individual ballade, however, is unclear and not agreed upon.\nBallades were composed before Chopin, in literature and Italian Renaissance music. But, Chopin invented the \"ballade\" as an abstract musical form. The ballade is a distinct form and cannot be placed into another form (e.g. sonata). After Chopin, other composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms also wrote ballades.\nThe ballades are thought to be the best of Chopin's compositions and of romantic music. The ballades are difficult for pianists to play, even after they learn the technical difficulty of the notes. There are still the creative expressions to be mastered. \nAll four ballades are from 8 to 12 minutes in length. They are in triple time (three beats to a bar), or in 6/4 or 6/8 time. Each is an individual work and should not be played as a group in a concert. Even Chopin did not do this. He wanted listeners to find their own interpretation of the music. Each piece has its own poetry, drama and story.\nChopin's four ballades are very popular pieces and are often heard in concerts around the world. There have been many recordings made of the ballades by classical pianists."}

She was the first African-American person to have a book published. She was born in West Africa. However it is not known which country she was born in. It was Senegal or The Gambia. She took work as a slave in the United States when she was about seven years old on a slave ship called The Phillis. Her master and his wife taught her how to read and write. Wheatley wrote her first published poem when she was 13. She wrote over 100 poems in her life and at least 30 had lost.Although she was an African slave, Phillis Wheatley was one of the best-known poets in America. In 1770 Wheatley wrote a poetic tribute to the evangelist George Whitefield. A lot of people said good things about the poem. In 1773 a collection of 39 poems Wheatley had written, \"Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral by Phillis Wheatley...\" It was the first writings by an African American woman to publish in public. The book made her famous in England and the American colonies. There was a poem in the book about slave trader brought people from Africa to America. Other than this Wheatley did not write much poetry about slavery. Wheatley's mistress Mrs. Wheatley died on October 18, 1773. At this point Wheatley did not have to do household chores anymore. Yet, it was not until 1778 that she had set free when her master, John Wheatley, died. That year she married John Peters. Peters was a free black grocer. They had two children. Both of them died when they were babies. Her husband got put in prison in 1784 for debt. After this Wheatley became very poor. Wheatley died of illness in 1784 in Boston. She was 31 years old.\nEarly life.\nPhillis Wheatley was born around 1753 in Gambia, Africa. She captured by slave trader and brought to America in 1761, which she was only a seven or eight years old young girl. Her front teeth was missing that time. When she arrived America, she got sold to Wheatley family in Boston, Massachusetts. The reason John Wheatley purchased her was that he needed some young girls to serve his wife, who has weak body. In addition, the Wheatley family educated her. After sixteen months, she can read the Bible, and books in different three languages. Wheatley family saw the talent from her, so they allow her to focus on her study. When she at fourteen years old, she began writing the poem and published her first poem in 1767.\nHer marriage and life after marriage.\nOn April 1, 1778, Wheatley married John Peters, a handsome and well-mannered free black. They knew each others for five years,then they married. He likes to call himself Dr. Peters, practicing law and keeping a grocery store at the court. But, his business did not work well and match his dream. Soon after their marriage, they moved to Wilmington, Massachusetts. Shortly returning to Boston they set up their home in the run-down section of the city. Since John Peter could not find a job and that made them became very poor. She had three children with John Peter but they all died when they were still a baby. The debt from John Peter makes Wheatley go to work as a charwoman.\nHer writing style.\nHer writing style seems to affect by different things.Her writing style also embraced the elegy, likely from her African roots. It was the role of girls to sing and perform funeral dirges. Religion was also a key influence, and it led Protestants in America and England to enjoy her work. Wheatley\u2019s poems reflected several influences on her life. She is strongly against slavery, she emphasizes that all the different people should all have their freedom. For example, America separates from England, and African American set free from slavery. She wrote several letters to ministers and others on liberty and freedom. That shows she put her belief in her letters and her poems to tell the people what she thinks is right.\nLegacy.\nTwo of Wheatley's writings were printed after she died. Vincent Carretta wrote a book about Wheatley's life called \"Phillis Wheatley: Biography of a Genius in Bondage\". It was published in 2011. In 2012, Robert Morris University named the new building for their School of Communications and Information Sciences after Phillis Wheatley. A statue of Wheatley is part of the Boston Women's Memorial on Commonwealth Ave in Boston."}

They were fast, omnivorous or herbivorous dinosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous of Laurasia (now Asia and North America). Members of the Ornithomimidae include \"Gallimimus\", \"Archaeornithomimus\", \"Anserimimus\", \"Struthiomimus\", and \"Ornithomimus\".\nOrnithomimids are a sister group to the troodontids. These groups had many bird-like features, including feathers, but they were not birds.\nThe skulls of ornithomimids were small, with large eyes, above relatively long and slender necks. All had toothless beaks.\nThe fore limbs ('arms') were long and slender and bore powerful claws. The hind limbs were long and powerful, with a long foot and short, strong toes terminating in hooflike claws. \nOrnithomimids probably acquired most of their calories from plants. Many ornithomimosaurs, including primitive species, have been found with numerous gastroliths in their stomachs, characteristic of herbivores. Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested that the long, sloth-like 'arms' of ornithomimids may have been used to pull down branches on which to feed, an idea supported by further study of their strange, hook-like hands. Ornithomimids probably acquired most of their calories from plants. Many ornithomimosaurs, including primitive species, have been found with numerous gastroliths in their stomachs, characteristic of herbivores.\nThe sheer abundance of ornithomimids \u2013 they are the most common small dinosaurs in North America \u2013 is consistent with the idea that they were plant eaters, as herbivores usually outnumber carnivores in an ecosystem. However, they may have been omnivores that ate both plants and small animal prey."}

The period saw many changes in fashion, including changes in clothing, architecture, literature, and visual arts.\nDuring this period, fashion changed a lot. In the 1800s, you had small silhouettes and pastel colors. In the 1830s, there was very exaggerated fashion. The 1860s are also famous for this along with the 1870s, the 1880s, and the 1890s. But during the early part of the 20th century, fashion was toned down in the sense of exaggeration and playfulness. \nThe main woman who inspired was the Queen of England and Empress of India, Victoria. She was at the peak of royalty and ruled for many years, therefore influencing many trends during the century. \nBy 1907, clothing was increasingly factory-made and often sold in large, fixed price department stores. Custom sewing and home sewing were still significant, but on the decline. New machinery and materials developed clothing in many ways.\nThe introduction of the lock-stitch sewing machine in mid-century simplified home and boutique dressmaking. It made it easy to add trimmings which would be costly if done by hand. Lace machinery made lace at a fraction of the cost of the old hand-made lace. Inventors developed new, cheap, bright dyes like mauveine which replaced the old animal or vegetable dyes."}

In 1046 he went with King Henry III to Italy and in December, he took part in the Council of Sutri. This took Popes Benedict IX and Sylvester III out of power, and also convinced Pope Gregory VI to resign. King Henry nominated (suggested) Suidger to be the new pope and the council elected him. Suidger took the name Clement II. Shortly after he was elected, Pope Clement and Henry moved to Rome. There, Clement crowned Henry III as Holy Roman Emperor. \nClement II's short pontificate (time as pope) began an improvement in the way the Roman Church worked, especially by making laws against simony. Simony is when people would pay to have sacraments given to them. \nThe reform party criticized Clement's election because there was royal involvement and because the pope was already bishop of another place. \nClement and the Emperor went on a journey through southern Italy to celebrate his election. Benevento was placed under an interdict (they were prevented from taking part in some Church rites) because they wouldn't allow Pope Clement to enter. Afterwards they went to Germany, where Clement made Wiborada a saint. Wiborada was a martyr who was killed praying for the people of her city.\nOn Henry III and Pope Clement's way back to Rome in October 1047, Pope Clement suddenly died. His body was taken to Bamberg, a place he had loved, and was buried near the Bamberg Cathedral. \nScientists studied Clement's body in the mid-20th century.

Yali asked \"Why is it that you white people [made] so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\" By \"cargo\", Yali meant inventions and objects that are made in a factory. Diamond thought about this question for years, which led to him writing the book.\nDiamond says that sometimes, one society has been far better at fighting wars and using inventions than another. This has led to times when one society found it very easy to conquer another. One example is when the Spanish conquered the Inca Empire in the 1530s. The Spanish won because they had far better weapons, and they also had horses. This is why thousands of Incas died fighting against 168 Spaniards at the Battle of Cajamarca. Another important reason why the Spanish won was diseases. The Spanish did not know that they had brought diseases to South America that killed many people. This also weakened the Inca Empire. The Spanish conquered the Inca Empire with their \"guns, germs and steel\", and other things.\nDiamond starts by talking about how modern humans (\"homo sapiens\") spread out of Africa and around the world. Diamond believes that it is unlikely that some modern humans could be born more intelligent than others, because if a more intelligent type of human appeared, they would spread around the world very quickly.\nHow farming began.\nAt first, humans lived in hunter-gatherer societies. This means that they lived by hunting animals and picking up foods from plants. The journey towards modern inventions began about 9,000 years ago when humans first learned to grow crops. In order to start farming these crops, humans first had to \"domesticate\" the crops, meaning that they had to change them so that they were better for farming. They did this by using \"selective breeding\". This means that they planted the seeds from the best plants, to make sure that better plants appeared the next year. Diamond talks about why this happened to some plants and not others. For example, most trees are not useful for farming because they take a very long time to grow. The most useful plants were plants that took only a year to grow.\nThe Fertile Crescent (an area now mostly in Iraq, Syria and Turkey) was the first place where humans learned to farm. China and New Guinea were also early places where humans learned to farm. Later, farming also began in other regions. However, some regions had more useful crops than others. Crops were more useful if they had more nutritious, meaning they had things like proteins that humans need from their food. They were also more useful if they were easier to grow and were less likely to fail in bad weather. This is why crops from the Fertile Crescent and China spread a long way, while those from New Guinea did not spread far from the island.\nFarming was a big change. In a farming society, more people could live in the same area (\"population density\") than a hunter-gatherer society. This is why they could easily take over the lands of hunter-gatherers, if their crops could grow there. Diamond notes that it was usually easier for crops to spread east or west than north or south, because crops could only grow in a similar climate. Humans from farming societies spread to regions where their crops could grow, such as from the Fertile Crescent to Europe, North Africa and South Asia and from China to the rest of East Asia. Eurasia (Europe and Asia) became home to far more farming societies than the rest of the world, and they had better crops. Meanwhile, these crops could not spread from North Africa into the middle of Africa, and therefore they did not spread to South Africa (where the crops could grow). Meanwhile, until Europeans discovered the Americas, crops from Central America did not spread to South America, and crops from South America did not spread to Central America.\nHumans also domesticated animals. As with plants, only some animals were good for this. For example, animals that lived in herds were easier to control than animals that lived alone. Mostly for similar reasons, Eurasia had more farm animals than the other parts of the world. Only two large animals were domesticated outside of Eurasia: llamas and alpacas in South America. Living with animals caused humans to catch more diseases. These spread through Eurasia and Africa. This is why many Native Americans died of diseases after European people travelled to the Americas, but the Europeans did not catch diseases from the Native Americans. On the other hand, in tropical areas, diseases like malaria stopped Europeans from moving into those areas until the late 19th century.\nFarming by region.\nDiamond writes about what each region was like before European explorers started travelling around the world:\nInventions.\nDiamond believes that farming was important because humans had to start farming before they could invent things like cities, metal, the wheel and writing. Farming led to humans living in larger groups, so they had to form more complicated societies. They began to live in countries rather than tribes. In a farming society, not everyone may work on a farm. Some people can do other jobs, like rulers, writers and inventors, because there is so much food. The societies with the best farming were the ones that were more likely to have inventors. This is different to a hunter-gatherer society, where everyone must help find food. \nLater in the book, Diamond talks about why European countries developed more inventions than the rest of Eurasia. Because of this, some European countries were the first places to be changed by the Industrial Revolution and they also formed empires that ruled over distant lands (known as colonialism). Until the 15th century, China actually had more inventions than Europe. Diamond suggests that this changed because many European countries were in competition with each other. European countries had to keep changing and using new inventions, to avoid being conquered by other countries. Meanwhile, China was ruled as one empire that did not have to worry about this. Diamond also believes that geography affected this pattern. Geography made it hard for Europe to unite into large countries, but made it easy for China."}

It was dug in order to learn more about the inside of the Earth. Digging started on May 24, 1970. The work continued until 1992, or 1994. The borehole was kept open until 2005. SG-3, the deepest part of the hole, reached below the surface in 1989. That is the deepest hole ever made and is still the deepest man-made point on Earth.\nFor a long time, SG-3 was also the longest hole by distance from its opening. In 2008, the Al Shaheen BD-04A oil well in Qatar reached + farther and, in 2011, the Odoptu OP-11 oil well off Sakhalin got + farther.\nMaking the hole.\nThe hole was made with different machines at different times. The Soviets started making the hole with the Uralmash-4E. Later, they used the Uralmash-15000. At first, they wanted to get to below the surface. The machines broke the earlier record for the deepest hole on June 6, 1979. The prior record had been held by the Bertha Rogers hole in Washita County, Oklahoma, in the United States. The machines got to below the surface in 1983. Then the Soviet Union celebrated (took special note of) this for about a year without going any deeper. On September 27, 1984, the machine broke at a depth of ; its drill string twisted off and was left in the hole. When the Soviets started to make the hole again, they had to start from .\nThe greatest depth was reached in 1989. The people making the hole thought that they would get to by the end of 1990 and, at last, get to 15,000\u00a0m by 1993. They were not able to go any deeper, though, because they had made an error, and the end of the hole was in place of the they had hoped for. Their machines stopped making any holes at all in 1992. The last studies were stopped in 2005 and the place was completely closed and left alone in 2008.\nWhat we learned.\nThe Kola hole got about \u2153 of the way through the Baltic Shield, the part of the Earth's crust (its outer level of rock) below the Kola Peninsula. (People who study the Earth think it's about deep at the place where the hole was made.) The rocks at the bottom of the deepest hole were more than 2\u00bd billion years old.\nThe people who made the hole said they wanted to learn about the different levels of the Baltic Shield, how sound and heat move under the ground, or what kinds of rocks make up the deep crust, and to create new skills and tools for going deep into the Earth. One of the most important things they found was they had made an error about the kinds of rocks underground. When they looked at how sound waves moved through the Earth, they thought there should be a change from granite to basalt rocks at about below the surface. In fact, the sound waves had changed because the heat and pressure made the granite act differently. Also, this special kind of granite was broken into pieces and full of water. The water did not come from above but had been trapped in the deep crust by solid rock. Another important discovery was that the mud from the deep hole was \"boiling\" with hydrogen gas."}

In that context, one carat gold means that the twenty-fourth part of an alloy is gold, the other parts are made of other metals, generally silver or copper. Pure gold would be soft, which makes it unusable for many purposes. Alloyed gold is harder than pure gold and so more suitable for applications such as jewellery. An alloy that has 24 carat actually contains 99.9 percent gold, 18 carat gold contains 75 percent gold . Sometimes, a scale up to 1000 is used; as an example, gold 585 mean there is 58.5 percent gold in the alloy. This means that \"Gold 585\" actually contains 14 carat."}

It was the first battle that took place west of the Mississippi River. Nathaniel Lyon, the Union general, was the first general killed in the Civil war.\nPrelude to the battle.\nDuring the summer of 1861, the Union and Confederate Armies were both trying to control Missouri. By the second week of July 1861, the Union Army of the West commanded by Brigadier general Nathaniel Lyon, camped at Springfield, Missouri. In total, he had about 5,400 soldiers in his command.\nAbout 75 miles to the southwest of Springfield, the pro-Southern Missouri State Guard were camped. They were under the command of Major general Sterling Price. Price was joined by Confederate generals Benjamin McCulloch and Nicholas Bartlett Pearce. Combined their forces numbered about 12,000. In late July both forces started moving closer to together, each army trying to learn what they could about the other. There was a skirmish at Dug Springs, Missouri on August 2. This is near present-day Clever, Missouri. The Union forces won but this is when Lyon realized the Confederates had more than twice the forces he had. The Union forces retreated back to Springfield.\nThe battle.\nOn August 9, 1861, Lyon marched his troops from Springfield to where the Confederates were now camped at Wilson Creek. His plan called for Colonel Franz Sigel to do a flanking maneuver on the Confederates and attack them from their rear. The rest of Lyon's forces would attack from the north.\nOn August 10, Sigel's flanking maneuver surprised the Confederate army. It allowed the Union army an early advantage. The two armies fought fiercely in the fields and hills around Wilson's Creek. After six hours of fighting and numerous casualties on both sides, the Union forces withdrew. Siegel's attack had at first proved very successful, but fell apart when he mistook the Confederate 3rd Louisiana for federal troops and allowed them to get too close without being challenged.\nThree times the confederates attacked the Union line and failed to break through all three times. During the battle, Lyon was killed and Major Samuel D. Sturgis replaced him. Meanwhile, Sigel's mistake had cost him the advantage and his forces were routed. After the third attack at about 11:00 am, the Confederates withdrew. With his ammunition running low and his men exhausted he withdrew to Springfield. Too disorganized to follow, the Confederate army did not pursue. Technically, it was a victory for the Confederate Army since the Union Army left the field. However, it can be considered a victory for the Union since they still kept control of Missouri. The Confederate army called the battle of Wilson\u2019s Creek, the Battle of \u201cOak Hill(s)\u201d.\nMedal of Honor recipients.\nFive Union Soldiers received the Medal of Honor for their parts in the battle.

These two provinces form the region Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Alto Adige\" was created in the late 18th century by Napoleon Bonaparte, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps. This was the name of the French administrative division known as the \"Department of Alto Adige\" (\"Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige\"), created during Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy in 1810. It was officially named \"Haut Adige\" to get rid of relation to the historic \"County of Tyrol\" of Austria. The District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic.\nSome years later, Napoleon created the Department of Alto Adige further north. This department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814. It was created with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino). The boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, who said that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians.\nThe department was ended after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. Its territory is now divided between the Italian provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol.\nThe name \"Alto Adige\" was reused. Today it is the Italian name of the part of Tyrol south of the Brenner Pass. Ettore Tolomei made it official in Italy after World War I."}

The championship was debuted on the October 23, 2008 episode of \"TNA Impact!\" and was originally called the \"TNA Legends Championship\". It was considered the second highest-ranking title in TNA. It was declared defunct by the (storyline) TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle on July 3, 2014. The title was reactivated under the new name \"TNA King of the Mountain Championship\" on June 25, 2015.\nHistory.\nBooker T revealed the championship after he took it out of a steel briefcase that he had been carrying around in the weeks leading up to the reveal. He named it the \"TNA Legends Championship\" and declared himself as the first champion. A.J. Styles defeated Booker T at Destination X on March 15, 2009 to win the championship.\nWinning the title made Styles the first-ever TNA Grand Slam Champion after he had won the World Heavyweight (NWA or TNA), the World Tag Team (NWA or TNA), and the TNA X Division Championship along with the Legends Championship. The Management Director of TNA Jim Cornette announced that the Championship became an official TNA sanctioned championship because Styles defeated Booker T for it legally by the contract the two had signed to make the match official.\nWhen Eric Young held the championship, he renamed it the \"TNA Global Championship\" on the October 29, 2009 episode of \"Impact!\" and said that he was not going to defend it against any American wrestlers or on American soil. Young was defeated by Rob Terry during a live event in Cardiff, Wales on January 27, 2010.\nTerry lost the championship to A.J. Styles on the July 22 episode of \"Impact!\". Styles renamed it the \"TNA Television Championship\" on the July 29 episode.\nOn July 3, 2014, the TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle declared that the Television Championship would become inactive.\nOn June 25, 2015, the championship was reactivated under the new name \"TNA King of the Mountain Championship.\" It was announced by TNA that there would be a new champion crowned in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. At Slammiversary, Jeff Jarrett defeated Matt Hardy, Eric Young, Drew Galloway, and Bobby Roode to win the championship. Since Jarrett was the founder and running GFW, there were suspicions of Jarrett defending the championship in GFW. The championship did appear at a GFW live event on July 9 where Young attacked Jarrett and stole the championship.\nReigns.\nThe current champion is Bobby Roode. Roode is in his first reign as champion. He won the championship after defeating PJ Black during \"Impact Wrestling\" tapings on July 28, 2015.\nThe first champion was Booker T. He awarded himself the championship on the October 23, 2008 episode of \"Impact!\". The longest reigns in the championship's history was Abyss' second reign which lasted 396 days. The shortest reign was PJ Black's first reign which lasted only 1 day."}

The changes include increased heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure.\nThis response was first described by W.B Cannon. He found that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to changes such as those mentioned above. The changes prepare the animal for fighting or fleeing. This response is the first stage of a general adaptation that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms.\nEvolutionary perspective.\nThe fight or flight response lets animals respond quickly to threats. This system is universal in vertebrates. That shows it is ancient in origin, and very important.\nHumans have some problems with the system, because though they share the physiology with other animals, they rarely face a clear-cut fight or flight choice. Humans can try to talk their way through various problems and semi-threats, but they may suffer stress when the issues are not easily solved.\nOther responses.\nAnimals respond in many ways to situations which threaten them. The fight/flight choice is just one alternative. At one extreme is the way mother cats with kittens will defend them to the death if necessary. Another situation is the way many animals keep still when a predator is nearby. Their camouflage is often effective."}

In the first two challenges, Brown shows items that are put up to auction for the chefs to buy using their money. The chefs can use these items on other chefs to change their ingredients, what cooking tools they can use, and other things. For example, an item may force a chef to cook using canned ingredients instead of fresh ones. The chef who is eliminated has to give back the money that they have. In the last challenge, no items are shown at first, but during the first minutes of the challenge, Brown will put items up for auction. This makes it so the person who gets the item has to change their dish based on what the item does. The chef that wins keeps the money that they have left."}

He was best known for performing with Ozzy Osbourne and the band Quiet Riot.\nCareer.\nRhoads first formed a band with Kelly Garni called Little Women. Kevin DuBrow was recruited into the band and they changed their name to Quiet Riot. The band became popular by playing in clubs in Los Angeles. By late 1976 they were signed to CBS/Sony Records.\nDana Strum contacted Rhoads to see if he was wanted to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's new band. He asked his mother if he should join Osbourne's band since he was still in Quiet Riot. She asked him if he would accept \"an offer like this one\" and Rhodes replied \"Of course!\"\nHe went to audition in Osbourne's hotel room in Los Angeles with his guitar and a practice amplifier. As he started getting ready he was given the job. Osbourne was very drunk, and had fallen asleep during the audition. Rhoads remembered later, \"I just tuned up and did some riffs, and he said, 'You've got the gig'; I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, 'You didn't even hear me yet'\".\nRhoads flew to England on the November 27, 1979. He stayed with Osbourne, his wife at the time Thelma, and their two children. After a short while, Lee Kerslake joined the band, which was at the time called The Blizzard of Ozz. The band recorded their debut album \"Blizzard of Ozz\" which was released on September 20, 1980 and became a success. \"Diary of a Madman\", their second studio album, was recorded between February and March 1981. It was released on November 7, 1981.\nDeath.\nRhoads died on March 19, 1982. He was touring with his band at the time. While driving in their tour bus, the band stopped in Leesburg, Florida, to fix the bus' air conditioner. Osbourne stayed asleep because he had been drinking heavily earlier in the evening. While stopped, their driver Andrew Aycock noticed an airstrip with small helicopters and planes. Aycock had previously worked as a commercial pilot. He decided to take a small Beechcraft F35 plane registered to a man named Mike Partin. He took it without Partin's permission. He took keyboardist Don Airey and tour manager Jake Duncan for a flight. He took Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel Youngblood on for the second flight. Aycock tried to fly the plane very low over their tour bus, where the other band members were sleeping. He made two close passes but caused an accident on the third one. One of the plane's wings had clipped the top of the tour bus. This broke the wing into two parts and sent the plane spiraling out of control. Both Rhoads and Youngblood were thrown out of the plane's windshield by the initial impact. While traveling at about , the plane crashed into a nearby garage. All three passengers were killed instantly. They were burned beyond recognition from the fire of the plane. The only person to witness the accident was keyboardist Don Airey."}

When 1,500 missiles were shipped three hostages were released but those three hostages were soon replaced with three more hostages. Secretary of State George Shultz called it \u201ca hostage Bazaar\u201d\nOliver North was tried in court for the affair because he took the blame instead of Reagan. The court found North to be not guilty.\nOn March 4, 1987, Reagan himself apologized to the American people and said it was all his fault. George H. W. Bush later pardoned anyone who was involved in the affair.\nWhile President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause, the evidence is unclear as to whether he knew about the scandal.\nOn November 25, 1986, President Reagan announced the creation of a Special Review Board to look into the matter; the following day, he appointed former Senator John Tower, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to serve as members. This commission was called the Tower Commission. Towards the end, the committee said that there was no evidence to say that Reagan had anything to do with the affair."}

Police had been trying to arrest Duggan because he had been carrying a handgun and they thought he was planning to shoot someone. Duggan died at the scene from a bullet wound to his chest. The 2011 England riots started on 6 August 2011 because some criminals used Duggan's death as an excuse to burgle shops and set fire to things. They lasted until 11 August 2011. Five people were killed.\nOn 31 January 2013, Kevin Hutchinson-Foster was found guilty of giving Duggan a gun and was sent to prison.\nAn inquest into Duggan's death began on 16 September 2013. On 8 January 2014 a jury decided that his death was a lawful killing. It was decided that it was lawful because the police officer who shot Duggan told the jury he believed that Duggan was holding a gun and was going to shoot it. Witness B said that Duggan was not holding a gun. He said that Duggan was holding a mobile phone. There was a gun in a sock 10\u201314 feet away from where Duggan was shot. The sock and the gun did not have Duggan's DNA on them. Duggan's family were angry about the jury's verdict.\nOn 11 January there was a vigil for Duggan outside Tottenham police station. Hundreds of prostesters were there.\nBackground.\nTension with police.\nThere was tension between black people and the police in Tottenham before and since the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985.\nDuggan.\nDuggan was born on 15 September 1981 to a white mother, Pamela Duggan, and a black father, Bruno Hall. He grew up in Broadwater Farm. At age 13, he left home to live with one of his maternal aunts in Manchester. Duggan had three children with his partner Semone Wilson at the time of his death, as well as three other children by other women.\nAfter his death police and other people said that he was a drug dealer. His family and friends said that he was not. Tony Thompson of the \"London Evening Standard\" wrote that Duggan may have been one of the first members of North London's \"Star Gang\". Duggan's family said that \"He was not a gang member and he had no criminal record.\" Duggan had been convicted of having cannabis in 2000 and having things that he knew had been stolen in 2007. \"The Daily Mail\" said that he had also been arrested many times. The things he was arrested for included the murder of Gavin Smith and attempted murder. He was not charged with the murder of Smith because there was not enough evidence.\nIn March 2011 Duggan's cousin had been stabbed to death at a nightclub. Some people said that this made Duggan want to carry a gun.\nDuggan was under investigation by Operation Trident. \"Trident have jammed me,\" he wrote in a text message minutes before his death.\nShooting.\nOfficers of the Metropolitan Police Service stopped a cab that was carrying Duggan as a passenger at about 6:15pm on 4 August 2011. They did this because they had been told that Duggan had a gun. A firearms officer said that Duggan got out of the cab and pulled a gun from his waistband. He then ran away. Police shot him twice. An eyewitness said that Duggan \"was shot while he was pinned to the floor by police.\" Paramedics came, but he died before he could be taken to hospital. A 9mm gun was found 10\u201314 feet away from where Duggan was shot on the other side of the fence. Witnesses told the IPCC that they saw police throw the gun over the fence.\nAftermath.\nPolice waited a day and a half to tell Duggan's family to tell them that Duggan was dead.\nRiots.\nThe 2011 riots started with the peaceful protest of Duggan's death.\nAt about 5:30pm on 6 August 2011, Duggan's family and people living in the area marched from Broadwater Farm to Tottenham Police Station. They chanted \"we want answers\". Around 8pm a 16-year-old girl was beaten by police with a baton. A witness said that she had thrown something at the police. Around 8:20pm members of a crowd waiting to speak to a police officer set fire to two police cars. The next day people rioted in other areas of London. Most of the rioters were young men. On August 9 a man died after being shot in Croydon on August 8. On August 10 three men were killed in a hit-and-run. A man died on 8 August from injuries from an attack by a mob. By 15 August 2011, about 3,100 people had been arrested.\nMedia coverage.\nDuggan's death quickly became a big news story. Duggan was called a 'gangster' and a 'thug' by the \"Daily Mail\". On September 8 2011 an article by Martin Samuda, a friend of Duggan, was published in \"The Guardian\". Duggan's brother Shaun Hall also wrote an article for \"The Guardian\" in September 2013 which said that Duggan's family did not trust the police anymore.\nFuneral.\nOn 9 September 2011 there was a funeral for Duggan. Thousands of people were there.\nFather's death.\nIn 2012 Duggan's father died from cancer.\nInquest.\nA public inquest into Duggan's death started on 16 September 2013. The jury learned that Duggan had been killed by a 9mm hollow-point round. A hollow-point bullet. Two witnesses said that they saw a police officer move something from the minicab to the place where the gun was found. Duggan's lawyers argued that police had put the gun found near where Duggan was killed there to make Duggan's killing look lawful. The officer who killed Duggan said Duggan was still holding a gun when both shots were fired. 9 of the jury decided that Mark Duggan threw the firearm on to the grass.\nProtests.\nOn 11 December 2013 students protested outside the Royal Courts of Justice during the inquest.\nVerdict.\nOn 8 January 2014 the jury decided that Duggan's death had been a lawful killing. People living in Tottenham said that there may be more riots because of this."}

Evan Chandler killed himself on November 5, 2009. His death was four months after that of Michael Jackson.\nJackson first met Jordan Chandler when Chandler was five years old.\nJackson had become good friends with Jordan Chandler and his family after meeting Chandler in May 1992. Evan became jealous of Jackson because his son liked spending time with him more. In July 1993 Jackson and Jordan's relationship ended. Chandler, who was a dentist, was made to admit that he gave his son a barbiturate called sodium amytal to take out his tooth in August 1993. While he was under the influence of the drug Jordan told his father that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan Chandler told the police about the abuse. Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit began a criminal investigation on Jackson on August 18. Police searched Jackson's Neverland Ranch. They found books and photographs in his bedroom that had young boys wearing little or no clothing in them.\nJackson ended his Dangerous World Tour on November 11, 1993 to go to rehab. He had become addicted to painkillers, which he used for the stress of the allegations.\nLa Toya Jackson, Michael's sister, said at a press conference on December 9, 1993 that \"This has been going on since 1981, and it's not just one child.\" Her husband and manager at the time Jack Gordon said that Michael Jackson had said that he would kill La Toya if she told. In 2011 La Toya said \"I never for a minute believed my brother was guilty of anything like that\".\nStrip search.\nIn December 1993, Jackson was strip searched. Jordan had told the police what Jackson's genitals looked like. Chandler said that Jackson was circumcised, but he was not.\nJackson's reaction.\nOn December 22 Jackson talked about what had happened via satellite from his ranch. He said,\n'As you may already know, after my tour ended I remained out of the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on pain medication...There have been many disgusting statements made recently concerning allegations of improper conduct on my part. These statements about me are totally false...I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the mass\u2014matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions. I ask all of you to wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me. Don't treat me like a criminal, because I am innocent. I have been forced to submit to a dehumanizing and humiliating examination...It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life...But if this is what I have to endure to prove my innocence, my complete innocence, so be it.'\nSettlement.\nThe case was settled in 1994 with a payment of over $15 million to be put in Jordan Chandler's trust fund, $1.5 million for each of his parents, and $5 million for the family's lawyer. No criminal charges were ever made against Jackson. In 2004 Jackson's attorney for the 2005 Michael Jackson trial Thomas Mesereau Jr. said that Jackson regretted making these payments.\nAftermath.\nThree years later a book by a journalist called Victor M. Gutierrez was published called \"Michael Jackson Was My Lover\". It claimed to be the diaries of Jordan from the time period in which he was molested by Jackson. Jackson sued Gutierrez for slander. It was banned in the United States.\nEffect on Jackson's career.\nAfter the allegations PepsiCo ended its sponsorship of Jackson. Dubai would not let Jackson perform. \"Dangerous\" was going to be released as the tenth single from \"Dangerous\" but was cancelled.\nJackson's first album after the allegations was \"\". It has sold 25 million copies. This makes it one of the best-selling albums ever released. However, \"Dangerous\" sold more.\nPeople v. Jackson.\nOn December 18, 2003 Jackson was charged with seven child sexual abuse offences. Earlier that year a documentary called \"Living with Michael Jackson\" had been on television. In the documentary Jackson was shown holding hands with his accuser, 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo. Jackson said in the documentary that he shared his bed with children who were not family. Arvizo said that Jackson started molesting him after the documentary was shown. Jackson was found not guilty of all charges on June 13 2005.\n2013 child molestation allegations.\nMichael Jackson died in 2009. On May 1, 2013 Wade Robson's lawyer sent a private complaint against the Michael Jackson Estate 'for childhood sexual abuse'. In the 1993 investigation and 2005 trial Robson had said that Jackson had not molested him. Robson had been Jackson's \"special friend\" in 1990. Robson said on \"The Today Show\" on May 16, 2013 that Jackson as a \"pedophile\" who sexually abused him from ages 7 to 14."}

Black operations are secret and whoever does them does not admit that they ever happened. There are differences between black operations and ones which are just secret.

It might also be blaming the operation on someone else (\"false flag\" operations). \nOne example of a black operation is a \"black bag operation\". A black bag operation is when agents or soldiers secretly go into buildings and collect intelligence.

Later he became the King of Northumbria. When Oswiu defeated and killed Penda of Mercia at the Battle of the Winwaed, he became the seventh over the southern English kings. He took the throne of Mercia and appointed his son-in-law Peada (Penda's son) as a client king. Oswiu was one of those rare kings of Northumbria who died of natural causes and not in battle.\nEarly career.\nOswiu was born He was a son of King Athelfrith of Bernicia and his second wife Acha of Deira. He was a younger brother of King Oswald of Northumbria. When he was about 6 years old his father was killed in battle by Edwin who became King of Northumbria. Along with his brothers Eanfrith and Oswald and their sister Aebbe, he found safety with the Scots in D\u00e1l Riata. The monks of Iona baptized the children and raised them in the Celtic Christian faith.\nAbout 634 Oswiu married Rhiainmelt, daughter of Rhoeth of Rheged, a marriage alliance arranged by his brother King Oswald. He had a son by this marriage, Alfrith of Deira. Rhiainmelt seems to have died as a year later Oswiu was in Ireland with the D\u00e1l Riatans. There he was involved with Fina, the daughter of the high King Colman. There is no record they married but they had a son Aldfrith of Northumbria (Irish name \"Flann F\u00edna mac Oswiu\").\nKing of Bernicia.\nWhen his brother Oswald was killed in 642, the overlordship died with him. Oswald had been king of a combined Bernicia, Deira and Lindsey (kingdom). But Northumbria was divided back into its earlier weaker sub-kingdoms. Penda, now the most powerful king in England took Lindsey. Oswiu became King of Bernicia. Oswine claimed Deira, preventing Oswiu from keeping it with Bernicia. A year after it happened Oswiu recovered parts of his brother's body from the battlefield where he died. Oswiu had Oswald's arm enshrined in his royal centre at Bamburgh and his head was taken to Lindisfarne.\nOswiu invaded Deira in 651 seeking to reunite Deira with Bernicia. Oswine was betrayed by one of his own noblemen and was murdered in 651 on Oswiu's orders. But the Deirans chose Athelwald, Oswiu's nephew, as their king. Athelwald then aligned himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda. Deira was under the protection of Mercia for the next three years. But Penda was determined to defeat Oswiu and take Bernicia as well. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. According to Bede, Penda attacked Oswiu several times. With a much smaller force Oswiu attacked Penda's army near the banks of the River Winwaed. Most of the commanders of the thirty legions were killed including King Anna of East Anglia and Penda. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia.\nEaster controversy.\nWhen Oswiu and Eanflaed were married, he was raised in the Celtic church while she was raised in the Roman church. The main difference was how each calculated the date of Easter. Members of the Celtic church might be celebrating Easter while the Roman church was celebrating Lent. In 658 his son Alfrith, who now supported the Roman Church, replaced several of his Celtic church officials with those from the Roman church.\nTo resolve the differences between the two religions in his kingdom, Oswiu called for a in 664. Called the Synod of Whitby it was to decide on when to celebrate Easter and what rules the monasteries in Northumbria would follow. Members of the church were summoned from all over the north. The Roman position was given by Wilfrid who would afterwards become Bishop of Northumbria. Bishop Colm\u00e1n argued for the Ionan calculation of Easter given them by Columba, founder of their order. Oswiu made the decision in favor of the Roman practice, uniting Northumbria under one religion. It joined Northumbrian religious practices to those of the southern English.\nBede, in his \"Ecclesiastical History\", Book IV, chapter 5 gives the date of Oswiu's death as 15 February, 670 and his age at 58. His wife Eanflaed retired to the monastery at Whitby. This is where their daughter, also named Enflaed, was brought up. In 680 Enflaed and her daughter became joint abbesses at Whitby. Enflaed died .\nFamily.\nBased on Nennius' \"Historia Brittonum\" Oswiu's first wife was a Briton named Reinmelth. She was the daughter of Royth, King of Rheged.

The word homology has the Ancient Greek root \"homos\", which means \"identical\". \nFor a topological space, the homology groups are generally much easier to compute than the homotopy groups, and consequently one usually will have an easier time working with homology to help with the classification of spaces.\nThe original motivation for defining homology groups is the observation that shapes are distinguished by their \"holes\". Since a \"hole\" is defined by something that is \"not there\", this poses the problem of how to define what a hole is, and how to distinguish between different kinds of holes. Homology is a rigorous mathematical method for defining and categorizing holes in a shape. As it turns out, there are some kinds of holes that homology cannot \"see\" \u2014 in which case homotopy groups may be what is needed."}

Aardvark does this by inhaling with a loud vacuum cleaner sound. In the episode \"Rough Brunch\", he claims that his name is simply \"Aardvark.\" Charlie Ant gives his several names as sly terms of endearment (Ol' Sam, Ol' Ben, Ol' Blue, Claude, Pal, Buddy, Daddy-O). In several bumper sequences of \"The Pink Panther Show\", he is called \"Blue Aardvark.\"\nFilmography.\nAll the voices were provided by John Byner unless otherwise noted.\nProduction.\n\"The Ant and the Aardvark\" series was originally released by United Artists. Seventeen theatrical shorts were produced in the original series, and were subsequently featured in various television syndication packages, usually shown with DFE's other characters such as the Pink Panther and The Inspector. Most of the 17 entries appear in their television syndication form (complete with an audible laugh track added by NBC-TV) on the video on demand service Amazon Video.\nWhen \"The Ant and the Aardvark\" first appeared on \"The New Pink Panther Show\" in the fall of 1971, the series became wildly popular, so much in fact that the duo became a featured part of the NBC series. Even though the 17 entries remained popular throughout the broadcast run of \"The Pink Panther Show\", no new entries were produced.\nThe series used several unique production techniques for the period. The aardvark's body was solid blue: his only clothes\u2014a pair of blue shorts and matching T-shirt\u2014were a matching blue. Similarly, Charlie Ant was solid red, and did not sport any clothing. As such, the character's solid colors allowed them to stand out clearly against the multi-colored backgrounds featured prominently in the series. Charlie also sported half-closed eyes, as a sign of a bon viveur.\nMusical director Doug Goodwin was responsible for the jazzy music score. Goodwin assembled an established group of jazz session musicians to perform the series' theme music and musical cues. For the first time in animated cartoons, all six musicians\u2014Ray Brown, Billy Byers, Pete Candoli, Shelly Manne, Jimmy Rowles, and Tommy Tedesco\u2014received on-screen credit.\nArt Leonardi was responsible for the main title graphic for all DePatie-Freleng entries. For \"The Ant and the Aardvark \"series, Leonardi expanded on a technique first introduced for the first Pink Panther cartoon, \"The Pink Phink\". This entailed tearing paper into the forms of objects and characters to form stylized images.\nAdditional characters.\nThere were additional minor characters in the series. Among them were the following:\nGerman version.\nIn the German-dubbed versions of the cartoon, the male aardvark is transformed into a female anteater named Elise (Eliza). Charlie (voiced by Fred Maire) remains male; Elise is voiced by Marianne Wischmann. The cartoons are known under the title \"Die blaue Elise\" (\"Blue Eliza\").\nRevivals.\nThe first revival featured the characters as part on the 1993 incarnation of \"The Pink Panther\". The characters remained unchanged, though unlike the original 1969-1971 cartoons, they do not appear in their own segments but rather are included in segments featuring the Pink Panther (now voiced by Matt Frewer). John Byner returned to voice both Charlie Ant and the Aardvark.\nThe second revival occurred in 2010 as part of \"Pink Panther and Pals\". Eddie Garvar voices the Aardvark, who retains his previous characterization. Kel Mitchell, using his natural voice, voices the Ant.\nHome releases.\nThe complete series was digitally remastered and issued on its own single-disc DVD collection by MGM Home Entertainment/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 2007 as \"Pink Panther and Friends, Volume 5: The Ant and the Aardvark\".\nThe complete series reappeared in January 2009 as part of the DVD collection \"Pink Panther &amp; Friends Classic Cartoon Collection\" by MGM Home Entertainment, a 9-disc DVD set containing all \"Pink Panther\", \"Ant and the Aardvark\", \"Inspector\" and (for the first time on DVD) \"Roland and Rattfink\" cartoons.\n\"The Ant and the Aardvark\" was released onto Region 1/A Blu-ray and DVD on 27 April 2016."}

After the young king of Portugal and his uncle died, three of their relatives fought the War of the Portuguese Succession. Philip II of Spain won, thus linking the monarchies of Portugal and the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg. This dynastic union joined the crowns of Castile, Portugal and Aragon along with their respective colonial possessions, under the rule of the Hispanic monarchy. The institutions, government and legal traditions of each kingdom remained independent of each other; they merely had the same king of Habsburg Spain. The alien laws (Leyes de extranjeria) determined that the national of one kingdom was a foreigner in all the other Iberian kingdoms. The term \"Iberian union\" was not used at the time, it is a creation of modern historians.\nThe monarchs had long wanted to unify the penisula: They had the visigothic monarchy in mind. Sancho III of Navarre and Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile both took the title \"Imperator totius Hispaniae\", meaning \"Emperor of All Hispania\" centuries before. If Miguel da Paz (1498\u20131500), Prince of Portugal and Asturias had become king, the union could have been achieved earlier. However, he died early in his childhood.\nThe history of Portugal from the dynastic crisis in 1578 to the first House of Braganza monarchs was a period of transition. The Portuguese Empire's spice trade was peaking at the start of this period. Vasco da Gama had finally reached the East by sailing around Africa in 1497\u201398, completing the exploratory efforts started by Henry the Navigator. This opened an oceanic route for the profitable spice trade into Europe that bypassed the Middle East.\nThroughout the 17th century, the increasing predations and surrounding of Portuguese trading posts in the East by the Dutch, English and French, and their rapidly growing intrusion into the Atlantic slave trade, undermined Portugal's near monopoly on the lucrative oceanic spice and slave trades. This sent the Portuguese spice trade into a long decline. To a lesser extent the diversion of wealth from Portugal by the Habsburg monarchy to help support the Catholic side of the Thirty Years' War, also created strains within the union, although Portugal did benefit from Spanish military power in helping to retain Brazil and in disrupting Dutch trade. These events, and those that occurred at the end of Aviz dynasty and the period of Iberian Union, led Portugal to a state of dependency on its colonies, first India and then Brazil."}

The concept is similar to the general text complexity, which is measured by the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test.\nCyclomatic complexity is computed using the control flow graph of the program: the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions, modules, methods or classes within a program.\nOne testing strategy, called Basis path testing by McCabe who first proposed it, is to test each linearly independent path through the program; in this case, the number of test cases will equal the cyclomatic complexity of the program."}

As a prominent Republican he served in a variety of prominent state and federal positions for three decades, including Chairman of the California Republican Party, 1962-68. Most notably he was appointed Secretary of Defense under Republican President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1987.\nHe was awarded both the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1987 and an honorary British knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.\nWeinberger was born in San Francisco, California on August 18, 1917. He studied at Harvard College and at Harvard Law School. Weinberger married Jane Weinberger in 1942. Their marriage would last until Weinberger's death. They had two children.\nWeinberger was treated for and died from complications of pneumonia at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, Maine, aged 88.\nEarly life.\nWeinberger was born in San Francisco, California in 1917. His parents had been Jewish but by the time Weinberger was born they were not members of any synagoge or church. Weinberger later joined the Episcopalian Church. He had health problems as a boy, but did well in high school and was accepted to Harvard University. While in college, he edited the \"Harvard Crimson\", the university's student newspaper. He graduated with a law degree in 1941.\nSoon after he graduated from Harvard, Weinberger joined the United States Army. When Japan attacked the US Navy at Pearl Harbor in December of that year, Weinberger went to war in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. By the end of the war he served in intelligence, and became interested in politics. He came to admire Winston Churchill, who was a personal hero of Weinberger. After he left the army he went back to his hometown of San Francisco where he worked as a law clerk and a lawyer.\nPolitical career.\nIn 1952 he ran for the California state assembly. Here he was well known for being a major supporter water infrastructure projects and for trying to stop a freeway from being built through downtown San Francisco (the freeway was built, but it was torn down in 1989). He ran for Attorney General. Although he lost, he became the chairman of the California Republican Party. He served in a number of jobs in California before running the Federal Trade Commission, where he became known for enforced laws meant to protect consumers.\nPresident Richard Nixon appointed Weinberger as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. He was nicknamed \"Cap the Knife\" because he was good at cutting wasteful spending. When Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, Weinberger was appointed Secretary of Defense, the job responsible for military affairs. While at this job he saw a military buildup meant to be a force against Soviet aggression. He felt that if the United States had a stronger military it could better deal with the Soviet Union.\nWeinberger was Secretary of Defense during the Iran Contra scandal, which involved selling guns to Iran to give money to a group of rebels in Nicaragua called the Contras, who were fighting the socialist dictatorship there. Weinberger didn't want to do this but he did not prevent it from happening. In the early 1990s he was investigated for it, but wasn't charged with a crime.\nIn 1987, Weinberger retired from the defense department. He is often given credit for helping to end the Cold War peacefully by increasing pressure on the Soviets with military spending. Some histories criticize him for not stopping the Iran Contra deal. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the US and was a knighted as a Member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II of England.\nLater years.\nIn 1989, Weinberger joined Forbes magazine as an editor. He wrote a book in 1990 called Fighting for Peace. Along with his wife Jane (who helped start him in politics), Weinberger retired to Mount Desert Island in Maine, near Acadia National Park. He died in 2006 at the age of 88 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery"}

The outcome of the battle was a major victory for Oswiu and a restoration of Northumbrian dominance of Anglo-Saxon England.\nBackground.\nSeveral events led to the battle of the Winwaed. King Oswald of Northumbria was considered the or overlord over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England. Penda of Mercia defeated and killed Oswald of Northumbria in 642 at the battle of Maserfield. This left Penda the most powerful king in England. Penda did not claim to be the overlord, however. When his brother Oswald was killed, Oswiu of Northumbria claimed the throne of Bernicia but was not able to rule Deira. It was a year before Oswiu felt it was safe enough to recover his brother's body from the battlefield where he was killed. To appease Penda Oswiu gave his daughter in marriage to Penda's son Peada. Also Oswiu agreed to the marriage of his son Alfrith and Penda's daughter Cyneburh. Still, Penda was not satisfied. He was determined to destroy Oswiu. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. Then, about 653, Penda began raiding into Bernicia.\nThe battle.\nIn a series of battles fought all across Northumbria, Oswiu kept being pushed back until he reached the far north of his kingdom. When Osiwu wanted peace, Penda took Oswiu's son Ecgfrith as a hostage. Oswiu also made an offer of tribute to Penda if he would bring an end to the hostilities. According to Nennius, Oswiu gave Penda all the treasure he had which Penda gave to his Briton allies. But Bede claims Penda turned down the offer of treasure as tribute. Penda took his army and left Bernicia. It was at this point, according to Bede, that Oswiu with a much smaller force attacked Penda's army. He caught up with Penda on the banks of the flooded Winwaed river. Some of Penda's allies deserted him and decided not to fight. But probably catching Penda's main force by surprise Oswiu's army fell upon the Mercians without mercy. Penda and most of the leaders of his 'thirty legions' were killed. Also killed with Penda was king Aethelhere of East Anglia. One of those who also withdrew and did not engage in the battle was Oswiu's nephew, King Athelwald of Deira. He had guided Penda through Northumbria and been his ally against his uncle. Because of the flooded river, more were killed by drowning than in battle.\nEffects.\nThe death of Penda and the rise of Oswiu to dominance had a major impact in 7th century England. Athelwald was either killed or went into exile. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia."}

A very good example of how this happens is the publication of scientific studies that rely on data that is inaccurate or misleading. More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.\nThe neologism was coined by Robert N. Proctor,\na Stanford University professor specializing in the history of science and technology. Proctor cites the tobacco industry's conspiracy to manufacture doubt about the cancer risks of tobacco use as a very good example of how this can be done. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.\nThe way in which media attention works can be exploited to produce ignorance. Other factors that influence it are that corporations or governments do not reveal certain facts. At times, they force these facts to be removed if they have been revealed. The methods they use include censorship, destroying documents, putting the weight of certain facts differently, or being inattentive or forgetful.\nAgnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do not \"come to be,\" or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about plate tectonics was censored and delayed for at least a decade because key evidence was classified military information related to underseas warfare."}

The term \"neologism\" was first used in English in 1772, borrowed from French \"n\u00e9ologisme\" (1734).\nUsing an existing word or phrase in a new context is also called \"neologism\". The process of using a word in such a new context is sometimes called a semantic extension. A new word that has not been used by anyone but the inventer is a \"protologism\".\nUse in psychiatry.\nIn psychiatry, the term \"neologism\" is used to describe the use of words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. This tendency is considered normal in children. In adults, it can be a symptom of psychopathy or a thought disorder, such as a psychotic mental illness, for example schizophrenia. People with autism may also create neologisms. Additionally, use of neologisms may be related to aphasia acquired after brain damage resulting from a stroke or head injury.\nUse in theology.\nIn theology, a neologism is a relatively new doctrine (for example, Transcendentalism).

It was mainly between the armies of the Christian king Oswald of Northumbria and the pagan King Penda of Mercia. The battle ended in Oswald's death and his army's defeat. The site of the battle is reported to be at Oswestry in Shropshire.\nBackground.\nKing Oswald's uncle, King Edwin of Northumbria, was killed at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in 633 by Penda and his ally Cadwallon ap Cadfan. After the battle Cadwallon and Penda began slaughtering the people of Northumbria. This included men, women and children. Northumbria fell apart and was divided into its two former kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia. Oswald defeated and killed Cadwallon ap Cadfan at the Battle of Heavenfield in 634. After that Oswald reunited Northumbria into a single kingdom. Oswald was considered a \"\" by Bede, the fourth such overlord over the other Anglo-Saxon kings. Penda remained a constant threat but was kept busy fighting the East Angles and making new alliances with the Welsh. Oswald also created several similar alliances in an effort to contain Penda. About 638 he won a battle against Owen Map Bili, the king of Strathclyde near Edinburgh. In 640 Oswald recovered the kingdom of Lindsey from Penda.\nThe battle.\nThere is no record of what led to this battle or why this place. As a pagan, Penda would not have been happy over Oswald bringing monks from Iona to Lindisfarne, further expanding Christianity in the north. The conquest of the Gododdin at Din Eidyn (Edinburgh) in 638 removed the last stronghold of the Britons in the north. Domnall Brecc, King of Dal Riata defeated them and was a close ally of Oswald. Northumbrians may have been there also. It would have angered the Welsh, Britons themselves, against Oswald. In 642 the armies of Northumbria and Mercia (with his Welsh allies) met at a place called Maserfield (probably in Shropshire). Oswald was killed in the battle. For a year after the battle his head and hands were fastened to stakes. Oswald's brother Oswiu finally recovered Oswald's body. Oswiu succeeded Oswald as king of Northumbria.\nOutcome.\nThe battle of Maserfield left Penda \"the most formidable king in England.\" Following the battle, Deira, in the southern part of Northumbria, chose a king of its own, Oswine. Bernicia in the north was ruled by Oswald's brother Oswiu. The immediate effect of the battle was to weaken and divide Northumbria. The long term effect was that Oswiu restored Northumbrian power over the next 13 years. He finally defeated and killed Penda at the Battle of Winwaed in 655."}

The title was usually used by a younger son of a reigning King and was passed from father to son. During the reign of Louis XIV of France the title was used by his only broth Philippe who as a \"Son of France\" was known simply as \"Monsieur\". At the death of Philippe in 1701 the Dukes only held the rank of Prince of the blood but maintained their rank due to being descended from a son of a previous king. The holder of the title was entitled to be addressed as Your Serene Highness but this was used in writing only. The present day House of Orl\u00e9ans is descended from this line and takes its name from the prestigious title. \nAs princes of the blood they ranked above that of the Princes of Cond\u00e9 the Princes of Conti as well as the Count of Soissons. \nThe Dukes main seat was the Palais Royal in Paris and the lavish Ch\u00e2teau de Saint Cloud outside the capital as well as countless other residences. The Duke and his wife were also entitled to their own apartment in the Palace of Versailles."}

He was the sixty-fourth Mayor of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nBefore he was elected mayor, Ford was a city councilor. He was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election. He was re-elected to his council seat twice. Ford was elected mayor in the 2010 mayoral election and he took office in December 2010.\nOn September 10, 2014, Ford was taken to the Humble River Hospital in North York, Ontario, Canada. Ford suffered severe stomach pains for 3 months before. It was revealed that Ford suffered an abdominal tumor. After being rushed to the hospital, Ford announced he would not be running for Mayor, but for his old seat in the City Council. Ford's term as mayor ended when John Tory succeeded Ford as mayor on December 1, 2014.\nOn September 17, 2014, it was announced that Ford had liposarcoma.\nFord served as a Toronto City Councillor for Etobicoke North (Ward 2) from December 1, 2014 until his death.\nEarly life.\nRob Ford was born in Etobicoke, Ontario in 1969. He is the youngest son of Doug Ford, Sr. (1933-2006) and his wife Diane. Ford attended the public Scarlett Heights high school in Etobicoke. There he played center for the school's football team. Ford wanted to play professional football. His father treated him to summer football camps with the Washington Redskins and the University of Notre Dame. After graduating from high school, Ford went to Carleton University in Ottawa to study political science. Ford made the football squad, but did not play in any games. Ford started a sales job after Carleton at Deco Labels and Tags, the family business.\nPolitical career.\nFord served three terms as City Councillor from 2000 until October 2010. Ford was elected mayor in 2012 with 383,501 votes (47%). Among his accomplishments Ford arranged an agreement with the city's largest union to outsource garbage collection west of Yonge Street to a private . This was done with no work stoppage.\nWhen he ran for mayor Ford proposed to make the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) an 'essential service'. Under Ontario law, an essential service prevents its workers from going on strike. The Toronto City Council approved of the decision in January 2011. The Government of Ontario introduced the \"The Toronto Transit Commission Labour Disputes Resolution Act\" in February 2011 and it became law in March 2011. Another campaign promise was to cancel the annual $60 personal vehicle registration tax. The council approved and it went into effect on January 1, 2011.\nHis first budget (2011) was balanced with no increase in taxes. A planned TTC hike was cancelled after Ford objected to it. In 2013, the city budget increased to $9.4 billion for and $2.27 billion for capital projects. The 2013 budget did not use surplus monies to balance the budget. Before the 2014 budget, Ford's office staff was shrunk and his responsibilities and committee controls were reduced.\nIn September 12, 2014, it was announced that Ford would not run for mayor because of health issues. He was succeeded by John Tory on December 1, 2014. Ford served as a Toronto City Councillor for Etobicoke North (Ward 2) from December 1, 2014 until his death.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2000, Ford married Renata Brejniak. Ford lived with Renata, their daughter Stephanie and son Doug in Etobicoke. After Doug Ford Sr.'s death in 2006, the Ford family retained ownership of the firm through the Doug Ford Holdings corporation. Ford, along with his brothers and his mother were directors of the company. Renata became the candidate for Etobicoke North for the 2019 federal election. She will represent the People's Party of Canada.\nHealth and death.\nA week after being hospitalized for an abdominal tumor, Ford was diagnosed with liposarcoma, a type of cancer. In late 2015, the cancer spread to his bladder. In March 2016, staffers said that Ford's cancer was not responding to chemotherapy treatments.\nOn March 21, 2016, Ford's family said that he was put in palliative care. The day after, on March 22, 2016, Ford died from the disease at a hospital in Toronto. He was aged 46."}

They are also called elaters, snapping beetles, spring beetles or skipjacks. \nThese beetles can be found almost anywhere on Earth. They have the unusual ability to flick themselves into the air. When they do this, they make a \"clicking\" (or snapping) sound. The beetle does this by flexing the joint between sections of the thorax, where there is a spine on one side of the joint and a groove on the other. The peg is snapped into the groove. This makes a \"click\" that flicks the beetle into the air. If it lands on its back, then it repeats the click until it lands on its legs. Clicking is mainly used to escape from predators. The click can make it jump between 15 and 30\u00a0centimetres into the air.\nBasic information.\nThe Elateridae family was defined in 1815. There are about 9,300 known species. This includes 965 species in North America.\nSome species are large and colorful, but most are under two centimeters long and dull in colour. They usually look for food during the night, and are usually not active during the day.\nThe oldest known species come from the Triassic period. There are only about 9,000 species known.\nWireworms.\nWireworms are the larvae of this beetle. They usually spend three or four years living under the soil. Here they feed on rotting plants and roots. They can cause damage to crops and gardens. When this happens, they can be very difficult to kill off.\nTheir famiily, the Elateridae, is known for its effects on agriculture, where they are notable pests."}

{"id": "435137", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435137", "title": "Welfare economics", "text": "Welfare economics is a field of economics that looks at the problem of allocating resources. It uses techniques from microeconomics to assess general well-being. From this assessment, it tries to find an allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium. It analyzes \"social welfare\" in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Individuals and their economic activities are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare. The aggregation may focus on a group of people, a community, or a society. There is no \"social welfare\" apart from the \"welfare\" associated with its individual units.\nWelfare economics typically takes individual preferences as given and tries to improve welfare in terms of Pareto efficiency. As an example, social state B is \"better\" than social state A, if at least one person prefers \"B\" and no one else opposes it. Another aspect of welfare treats income/goods distribution, including equality, as a further dimension of welfare.\nSocial welfare refers to the overall welfare of society. With sufficiently strong assumptions, it can be defined as the sum of the welfare of all the individuals in the society. Welfare may be measured either cardinally in terms of \"utils\" or dollars, or measured ordinarily in terms of Pareto efficiency. The cardinal method in \"utils\" is rarely used in pure theory today. Its main problem is that different kinds of \"utility\" cannot easily be summed up without losing the meaning of the measurement. In applied welfare economics money-value estimates are often used. One example of applied welfare economics is cost-benefit analysis. Money-value estimates are a useful form of measurement where income-distribution effects are factored into the analysis or seem unlikely to change the analysis.\nThe capabilities approach to welfare argues that freedom - what people are free to do or be - should be included in welfare assessments, and the approach has been particularly influential in development policy circles where the emphasis on multi-dimensionality and freedom has shaped the evolution of the Human Development Index.\nOther classifying terms in welfare economics include externalities, equity, justice, inequality, and altruism."}

It controls the current depending on the voltage.\nIn these devices resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred ohms. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self reset\u2013after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high. \nThis makes them ideal for surge-protection applications. As there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical substations, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.\nThey can be used to protect electronics from voltages that could damage components."}

They moved up the rivers Thames and Lea from what is now Belgium. Evidence for them was found in Devil's Dyke, at the eastern side of Wheathampstead.\nThe Devil's Dyke earthworks are remains of an ancient settlement of the Catuvellauni. It is thought to have been the tribe's original capital. The capital was moved to Verlamion, later the Roman Verulamium. This became the modern St Albans.\nThe Devil's Dyke is reputedly where Julius Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus in 54 BC, although this claim is disputed. The Dyke may have been part of the same defensive rampart as nearby Beech Bottom Dyke. If correct, this would make the area one of the largest and most important British Iron Age settlements.\nLater, the village is recorded in the Domesday Book under name \"Watamestede\". It appears that a church existed at Wheathampstead before the Norman Conquest, as Wheathampstead was given by Edward the Confessor to Westminster Abbey. The original structure was demolished in the reign of Henry III, and the oldest part of the present church dates to about 1280.

Patton slapping incidents refer to two events that involved an American general, George S. Patton. These happened during the World War II Allied campaign in Sicily. General Patton slapped two soldiers he thought were cowards who were in hospitals for . The general lost his command. He was sent back to England and played no part in the D-Day landing in Normandy.\nBackground.\nGeorge Patton believed it was part of a general's work to visit his wounded soldiers in hospitals. He did this more than other generals, even though he personally found it hard to do. His usual visit included talking to the soldiers and telling them how much he appreciated their courage. His aides followed him, pinning medals on soldiers as they went. General Omar Bradley, who knew Patton well, said that when it came to his men Patton was in spite of his manner. \nGrowing up, Patton had serious doubts about himself. He came from a long line of military heroes and one of his greatest fears was that he might be a coward in battle. Through his own strength of will, he conquered his fear. He expected the same from all the men he commanded. Any display of fear reminded him of his own earlier problems with fear.\nIncidents.\nOn 3 August 1943, Patton was visiting the 15th Evacuation Hospital. He found a soldier sitting on a supply box. The General asked him what he was there for. The soldier, Private Charles H. Kuhl, said \"I guess I just can't take it.\" The general was immediately angry: he swore at the soldier and slapped him with his gloves. The soldier had malaria and dysentery. \nA week later, at the 93rd Evacuation Hospital, the general came upon Private Paul G. Bennet lying on a bed. In reply to Patton's usual question of what was wrong with him, the soldier replied \"it's my nerves.\" The general yelled \"What did you say?\" Bennet repeated himself. Then Patton angrily swore at the soldier, calling him a coward. He hit the soldier and told him he had to return to the front lines. He even reached for his pistol. Patton was still yelling when he left the hospital tent.\nEffects.\nWhen Patton and his army entered Messina (16 August 1943), General Eisenhower wrote him, saying he had received word of the slapping incidents. Eisenhower told Patton there was no excuse for losing his temper in front of his soldiers. He said there was no excuse for brutality of the sick and injured. He ordered Patton to publicly apologize to their divisions and to the two men personally. Patton wrote Eisenhower a note of apology, then he proceeded to address his troops as he was ordered. On 30 August, he was giving his public apology for the third and last time to the 3rd Division: Patton was giving his short speech when his troops sensed he was about to apologize. They started chanting \"No general, no, no; General, no, no.\" They cut him off from his apology and would not let him give it. Overcome with emotion Patton left the stage.\nThe incidents were considered handled by Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall and news reporters were told not to file any stories on the incidents. In November 1943, however, one American columnist, Drew Pearson, filed the story anyway, accusing the Army of a cover-up. The American people, however, still mostly were behind Patton. The Germans were amused at the story and at the Americans: they saw nothing wrong with a general slapping a soldier. But Patton was too valuable to dismiss, so in early January 1944, Eisenhower sent him back to England. There he was placed in command of the First United States Army Group. It was an army that did not exist and was only intended to fool the Germans. The Germans thought Patton would lead the invasion of Europe, whenever it came. For the next six months, Patton was on his good behavior. After the D-Day landings, he was given command of the US 3rd Army in Normandy."}

Storage of radioactive waste must be guaranteed for thousands of years, until it decays sufficiently to be safe to the environment and its inhabitants.\u00a0Radioactive waste can be stored by deep geological burial or by dry cask storage.\u00a0Dry Cask Storage is large cylinders of concrete and steel that are used to hold 10 or more metric tons of high-level radioactive waste. The U.S. currently has no long-term radioactive waste storage site.\u00a0In 1987 Yucca Mountain, Nevada was a candidate for radioactive waste storage, but was shut down."}

He was born in McAlester, Oklahoma October 25, 1914. He was seen as one of the chief poets of confessional poetry.\nLife.\nWhen John Berryman was born in Oklahoma, his name was John Allyn Smith, Jr.. His father was a banker named John Allyn Smith. His mother was a schoolteacher named Martha. When he was ten years old his family moved to Tampa, Florida. In 1926, when he was twelve years old, his father shot and killed himself. This haunted the poet for the rest of his life.\nAfter his father died, his mother married another banker named John. His last name was Berryman. The poet took his father's name, so he ended up with the same last name as his stepfather. They moved to New York City. John was sent to a private boarding school in Connecticut. He went on to graduate from Columbia College.\nThe book \"Five Young American Poets\" had some of his earliest poems alongside other poets like Randall Jarrell. The publisher of this book also published Berryman's first book, \"Poems\". His next book, \"The Dispossessed\", was more mature but received mostly bad reviews. When Jarrell reviewed Berryman's book, he wrote that Berryman's poems sounded too much like William Butler Yeats. Berryman later said, \"I didn't want to be \"like\" Yeats; I wanted to \"be\" Yeats.\"\nIn 1947 John Berryman started seeing a married woman while he was married to his first wife. He wrote many sonnets about her, but they were not published until 1967.\nIn 1950 he wrote a biography of the writer Stephen Crane, who he admired. He also published a book of poems called \"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet.\" This book also featured drawings by the artist Ben Shahn. It was his first book to get attention from people all across the United States of America.\nEven though \"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet\" was successful, Berryman's biggest breakthrough came with \"77 Dream Songs\" in 1964. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1965. Berryman wrote a much longer sequel, \"His Toy, HIs Dream, His Rest\". This book was just as successful. He later combined the two into one book, \"The Dream Songs\".\nOn January 7, 1972, John Berryman killed himself by jumping off the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nPoems.\nBerryman wrote about shame, like mental illness and lust. He said that he was not writing about himself but about made-up people. Despite this remark, many critics believe Berryman did write about himself. John Berryman's best-known poems were called Dream Songs. He put out the 385 Dream Songs in two books: \"77 Dream Songs\" and \"His Toy, His Dream, His Rest.\" Later he put them into one book: \"The Dream Songs\"."}

In relationships, it involves a strong emotional attraction towards the other person. A romantic relationship focuses on feelings rather than sex. Romantic love is the opposite of platonic love.\nRomance is often strongest at the beginning of relationships. It comes with uncertainty and anxiety that the love may not be returned.\nAn example of love is that of Carla, for Quinten, as she loves him most.\nThe modern concept of romantic love comes from the medieval ideals of chivalry, as set out in its chivalric romance literature. It was made popular in Western culture by the concept of courtly love. Knights were often said to have had intimate relationships with the noble ladies they served. These relationships were usually not physical. Since marriage was commonly just a formal arrangement without love, courtly love allowed women to be emotionally intimate with a man.\nRomance is a major theme found in art, particularly literature and fiction.

This usually depends on that person's own conscience, their understanding of right and wrong. Guilt is usually related to remorse (\"feeling sorry\"). The American Psychological Association (APA) defines \"guilt\" as a \u201cself-conscious emotion\u201d denoted by a \u201cpainful appraisal of having done (or thought) something that is wrong.\u201d It also notes that such emotion can inspire people to reverse or compensate for perceived wrongdoing. \nThe origins of guilt as a human emotion are widely debated and theorized within many different disciplines. Examples of avenues through which guilt may be derived include society, culture, religion, and family.\nAccording to Carolyn Zahn-Waxler, professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, and Grazyna Kochanska, professor of developmental psychology at the University of Iowa, people first experience guilt during conscious development in childhood. Because guilt is complex and empathetic, many professionals characterize it as a defining emotion that distinguishes humans from other animals.\nGuilt can sometimes cause anxiety. A person may react to their guilt in either a peaceful or violent way. A person might begin blaming the victim of their own actions. Guilt contributes to many psychological conditions and to psychopathy. For example, some researchers suggest that sociopaths have little or no regard for others and therefore feel little guilt. Conversely, people who have schizophrenia or depression feel too much guilt and may find themselves projecting guilt onto hallucinations or ruminating on past mistakes. Additionally, people who experience anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), may become preoccupied with guilt about their thoughts or actions."}

One of the bodies of water found was named the Beagle Channel after the ship. During the voyage, Captain Pringle Stokes became depressed and shot himself. He died ten days later. Robert FitzRoy became the new captain. Beagle returned to England on 14 October 1830.\nSecond voyage (1831\u20131836).\nOn 27 December 1831, the \"Beagle\" began her second voyage.\nCaptain FitzRoy did not want to have the stress and loneliness that led to the suicide of the first captain. He looked for someone to go on the voyage to keep him company. The person found was Charles Darwin.\nOn this voyage, the crew did surveys in South America. \"Beagle\" returned to Falmouth, Cornwall, England on 2 October 1836.\nDarwin kept a diary of the things he saw and did on this voyage. He rewrote it as the book called \"Journal and Remarks\". The book was published in 1839 as the third volume of the official account of the expedition. It was very popular. It was reprinted many times with different titles. It eventually became known as \"The Voyage of the Beagle\".\nThird voyage (1837\u20131843).\nIn 1837, \"Beagle\" went to survey the coast of Australia. Commander John Clements Wickham was in charge. They started with the western coast between the Swan River (modern Perth, Australia) and the Fitzroy River. They then surveyed both shores of the Bass Strait. In May 1839 they sailed north to survey the shores of the Arafura Sea opposite Timor. This voyage ended in 1843.\nMany places around the coast were named on this voyage. Many of the places were named for important people or members of the crew. Wickham named Port Darwin in honour of Charles Darwin. A settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, and was renamed Darwin in 1911.\nDuring this survey, the Beagle Gulf was named after the ship."}

Well known nucleases are deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease.\nKinds of nuclease.\nNucleases may have the prefix \"endo\" or \"exo\" added to the name. Endonucleases break nucleic acid chains somewhere in the middle of the molecule. Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of DNA molecules.\nA restriction endonuclease does a specific job. It scans the length of a DNA molecule. Once it finds a particular sequence, it binds to the DNA molecule and makes a cut in each of the two sugar-phosphate backbones.\nDifferent endonucleases cut in different places, but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way, no matter what DNA molecule it is acting on. Once the cuts have been made, the DNA molecule breaks into fragments. In fact, more than 900 restriction enzymes, some sequence specific and some not, have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria since their discovery.\nThese enzymatic tools were important to scientists who were gathering the tools needed to \"cut and paste\" DNA molecules. They needed a tool to cut DNA at specific sites, rather than at random sites along the length of the molecule. This way they could cut DNA molecules in a predictable way.\nThis whole field of research started many years ago with the Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment."}

{"id": "435759", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435759", "title": "Aretino Records", "text": "Aretino was an American record label. It was in business from about 1907 to 1914. Aretino was started by Arthur J. O\u2019Neill. He started many record and phonograph businesses in the Chicago area. O\u2019Neill named this company in honor of Guido Aretino, an 11th-century Italian monk.\nAretino is an odd type of record because the hole in the center is very large compared to the normal size. It is the largest ever for a record that was made for people to use in their houses. Like many of O'Neill's other companies, Aretino was run as a premium scheme. A phonograph (record player) was offered for not much money. However, this record player could only play Aretino records because it came with a 3-inch spindle. O\u2019Neill also offered adapters for Aretino discs. These allowed the discs to be played on record players that had normal spindles, or even on a Busy Bee machine (another O\u2019Neill brand) which had two spindles instead of one.\nAretino did not make any of its own recordings: it borrowed masters from other companies. The first series of Aretino records had music on only one side of the disc. They were each given a catalog number beginning with the letter A. The music was recorded on them by Leeds &amp; Catlin. Leeds and Catlin also made a group of records for Aretino with catalog numbers starting with the letter D. These records have a recording on both sides. They are very hard to find now. Leeds &amp; Catlin was later shut down by court order for patent infringement. After that, Aretino records were made for a short time by two record companies named Hawthorne &amp; Sheble and Zonophone. These companies kept making records which only had music on one side of the record. They also kept using catalog numbers beginning with \"A\".\nIt was not long after this that Columbia became the maker of these records. No other companies made records for Aretino after Columbia began to make them. These records have a catalog number that begins with the letter \"D\" and then numbers that are larger than 500. They have music on both sides. Of all Aretino records, these are the most common. Most records from this time period have a diameter of 10\u00a0inches. Columbia also made a group of records for Aretino that are 12\u00a0inches in diameter. These are very hard to find. They have catalog numbers with the letter \"A\" at the beginning. Aretino stopped making anything after the year 1914.\nThe music on the Aretino label was like most music from those years. Some artists on Aretino are Henry Burr, William F. Denny, Byron G. Harlan, Ada Jones, Billy Murray, Vess Ossman, Steve Porter, Cal Stewart, and Bert Williams."}

Shotgun Sports include several different events, each with different rules. The general goal of a shotgun event is to break a clay target, but the targets are thrown in different manners depending on the game.\nSporting Clays.\nIn sporting clays, a shooter will walk through a course generally consisting of ten stations. Each station will have two targets that are thrown as a true pair or as a report pair(one thrown on pull command and one thrown on gun fire). Sporting clay courses are generally scored out of a 100.\nTrap.\nTrap is another clay target event. A game of trap is scored out of 25, and a full trap event generally consists of 4 trap games, or 100 targets. In this event, a team of 5 shooters lines up behind a trap house. Inside the trap house is a pivoting arm that throws a clay out at a random direction when 'pull' is called. To vary the difficulty of this game, shooters can stand farther back from the house.\nSkeet.\nIn the skeet shooting event, a shooter moves around a field in a semi circle. Skeet, like Trap, is also a 25 target game, with skeet events generally consisting of four games. There are 8 stations on the field. On one end of a field is a high house, and on the other end of the field, there is a low house. On station 1, 2, 6, and 7 a high single, low single, and double are shot. On stations 3, 4, and 5 a high single and low single are shot. Station 8 is in between the high and low house. At this station, the shooter faces the high house, shoots a high single, then turns and faces the low house to shoot a low single. This totals 24 targets. The last target, to make 25, comes from what is referred to as the option. The option is a target that is shot after the first target that is missed. If the shooter misses the high bird on station 1, the high bird is shot again. If the shooter makes it all the way around the field without missing a bird, a second low single is shot on station 8, totaling a perfect 25. "}
