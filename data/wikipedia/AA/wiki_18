It is on the river Pegnitz and the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal and is Franconia's largest city. It is about north of Munich, at 49.27\u00b0 N 11.5\u00b0 E. As of June 2017, there were 530,771 people.\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nFrom 1050 to 1571, the city became very important because it was on key trade routes. Many of the parliaments of the Holy Roman Empire (called the \"Reichstage\") met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg were an important part of the administrative structure of the empire. In 1219, Nuremberg became an Imperial Free City under Emperor Frederick II. This meant it was ruled by the Emperor, not one of the local lords or princes. It also meant that Nuremberg had a seat in the Imperial Parliament.\nIn 1298 there was a big \"\". Nearly 700 Jews were killed. The Jews lived near the river, and by getting rid of the Jews the northern and southern parts of the city could be linked together. This area is now the place of the City Market, Frauenkirche and Rathaus (City Hall).\nEarly modern age.\nIn 1532, the Peace of Nuremberg, gave Lutherans important concessions. In 1632 during the Thirty Years' War, the Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein besieged King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in the Siege of Nuremberg. The city became less important after this war, and only recovered in the nineteenth century, when it grew as an industrial centre.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century Nuremberg was practically bankrupt. In 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, and Nuremberg became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, and Bavaria took over the city's debts. The first German railway, from Nuremberg to nearby F\u00fcrth, was opened in 1835.\nNazi period.\nNuremberg was very important during the Nazi Germany period. The Nazi Party held huge Nazi Party conventions \u2013 the Nuremberg rallies in the city.\nThe rallies were held every year from 1927 to 1938 in Nuremberg. After Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge state propaganda events, and a centre of anti-Semitism and other Nazi ideas. At one rally, Hitler passed the anti-Semitic (anti Jewish) Nuremberg Laws which took German citizenship away from all Jews. A number of buildings were built for the rallies, some of which were not finished.\nToday many examples of Nazi architecture can still be seen in the city. The city was also the home of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, the publisher of \"Der St\u00fcrmer\".\nDuring World War II, Nuremberg was the headquarters of \"Wehrkreis\" (military district) XIII, and an important site for military production, including airplanes, submarines, and tank engines. A subcamp of Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was here. A lot of the factories used slave labour.\nThe city was badly damaged in bombing World War II, especially between 1943 and 1945. On January 2, 1945, the medieval city centre was bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Air Force and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 left homeless. In February 1945, more attacks followed. In total, about 6000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids. Despite this, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent, restored to its pre-war appearance including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings.\nBetween 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in the Holocaust and other war crimes were taken in front of the International Military Tribunal in the Nuremberg Trials. The Soviet Union had wanted the trials to take place in Berlin, but Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:\nThe same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals, organised by the United States as occupying power in the area.\nEconomy.\nNuremberg city has 501,000 people. As of 2005, the urban area had 763,000 people (about 822,000 people as of 2008). Nuremberg metropolitan area has 1,205,000 people. Nuremberg is still associated with gingerbread (\"Lebkuchen\") products, sausages, and handmade toys. The first pocket watches, called \"Nuremberg eggs\", were made there in the sixteenth century. In the nineteenth century Nuremberg became the \"industrial heart\" of Bavaria with companies such as Siemens and MAN.\nThings made in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, and printed materials.\nSiemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a third of German market research agencies is also in the city.\nThe Nuremberg International Toy Fair is the largest of its kind in the world. The city also hosts several specialist hi-tech fairs every year, attracting experts from every corner of the glob\nCulture.\nNuremberg was an early center of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention.\nThe city contributed much to the science of astronomy. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of K\u00f6nigsberg (Bavaria), later called Regiomontanus, built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts. In 1515, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, a native of Nuremberg, mapped the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by Johann Stabius. Around 1515 D\u00fcrer also published the \"Stabiussche Weltkarte\", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe. Perhaps most famously, the main part of Nicolaus Copernicus' work was published in Nuremberg in 1543.\nPrinters and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 Anton Koberger opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the \"Nuremberg Chronicles\", also known as the \"World Chronicles\" (\"Schedelsche Weltchronik\"), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by Hartmann Schedel and had illustrations by Michael Wohlgemuth, Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer Martin Behaim, who made the first world globe.\nSculptors such as Veit Stoss and Peter Vischer are also associated with Nuremberg.\nComposed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the Meistersingers flourished here. Richard Wagner made their most famous member, Hans Sachs, the hero of his opera \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\". Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel was born here and was organist of Saint Sebald church.\nNuremberg is also famous for its Christmas market, which draws well over a million shoppers each year.\nMain sights.\nThe southern part of the old town, known as Lorenzer Seite, is separated from the north by the river Pegnitz and surrounded by the city walls on the south.\nTransportation.\nRailways.\nNuremberg was the first city in Germany to have a railway, and today Nuremberg Central Station is a stop for IC and ICE trains on the German long-distance railway network. Trains on the Nuremberg \u2013 Ingolstadt \u2013 Munich High-Speed line travel at up to 300-km/h. The line opened on May 28, 2006. It meant travel times to Munich were reduced to as little as one hour.\nPublic Transportation.\nIn Nuremberg there are subways, suburban trains, trams and buses.\nSister cities.\nWorldwide, Nuremberg is twinned with the following cities:"}

For example, the businesses can give money to politicians in elections. Then, politicians give more money to the military. Then, the military buys things from the businesses. Each group gains something, so they try to keep doing the same thing.\nThe term was invented in the United States. However, most countries have politicians and soldiers and people who make weapons and other military supplies; thus they have a military-industrial complex.\nWhen there is a military-industrial complex, problems can happen. The government can become corrupt. A business might want the country to be at war because they make more money during war than during times of peace.\nWhere the term came from.\nPresident of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower used the term in his farewell speech\u2014the last speech he gave while he was the President. He said, \"we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\" This was a warning. It means that people should be careful or the military-industrial complex will get too much power.\nToday, the term is used a lot by people writing and talking about politics. Especially when the subject is militarism in the United States. It also appears in discussions about private military companies\u2014businesses that commonly employ soldiers who have left the military."}

It is the capital city of the province of Limburg.\nAbout 120,000 people live there.\nMaastricht has an airport and a university (Maastricht University).\nThe first settlement in that region was founded in the Stone age about 25000 years ago, the first permanent settlement was founded by the Celts about 500 B.C. Maastricht got City Rights in 1204. Since 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars, Maastricht belongs to the Netherlands. The European Contract of 1992 was signed in Maastricht, the so-called Treaty of Maastricht.\nHistory.\nThe first settlement was about 25000 years ago. Real permanent settlements (and not just hunter gatherers) were founded at least as early as 5000 B.C. 4000 years after that, the Celts built a settlement in Maastricht. They presumably worshipped a \"River God\". A Roman city was built around 0 AD, making Maastricht the oldest city of the Netherlands (together with Nijmegen). In this time, Maastricht was called \"Trajectum ad Mosam\". This means \"Road across the Maas\". A Roman bridge in Maastricht connected the west with the east, making Maastricht a very strategic point. This bridge - located at Eksterstraat - collapsed in the 13th century, and was replaced by the famous St. Servaas bridge.\nIn the early middle-ages Maastricht was very important in the spreading of Christianity in the Netherlands. In the 4th century, the bishop St. Servaas was the first bishop in the Netherlands, and the Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk (which also is the oldest still standing building in the Netherlands) could be described as the root of Christianity in the Netherlands. Servaas' remains are still kept in Maastricht in a tomb.\nMaastricht received its City Rights fairly early, in 1204. It was of strategic importance during the Eighty Years War and the Napoleonic Wars. Therefore, Maastricht has two forts; \"Fort St. Pieter\" and \"Fort St. Jan\". Maastricht also had city walls. Remains of those walls can still be seen today (notably the \"Helpoort\" is one the few still standing City Ports).\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, Maastricht was an industrial city, with many factory's. Jan Pieter Minckeleers - a scientist from Maastricht - was the first to discover Coal Gas, making the first city lights available. In 1940, Maastricht was conquered by the German forces. However, many paintings were hidden in the caves at Sint Pietersberg - a steep hill in the south-west of Maastricht. Even De Nachtwacht was hidden there. Maastricht was liberated on 14 September 1944. In 1992 Maastricht was the host-city for the 1992 European Treaty, where the EU was officially formed and a decision was made about the Euro.\nTopography.\nMaastricht is located on both sites of the river Maas in the south-east of The Netherlands and the south-west of the province of Limburg. Maastricht lies in a valley, the Maasvalley, so hills surround the city. On the south-west of the city, the famous \"St. Pietersberg\" is located. On the western edge of the city, there is no space between the city and the Belgian border. On the east, is the \"Savelsbos\" (a forest). Neighbouring municipality's are Eijsden and Vis\u00e9 (B) in the south, Lanaken (B) and Riemst (B) in the west, Meerssen and Valkenburg in the north, and Margraten in the east.\nTraffic and public transport.\nThe city can easily be reached. There is a highway (A2; E25) running from the south to the north (within the Netherlands, this highway runs from Eijsden to Amsterdam). Another highway also begins in Maastricht, the A79 (going to the east). Maastricht has two train stations (\"Maastricht\" and \"Maastricht Randwyck\"). Trains are going to Amsterdam, Heerlen, Roermond, and Brussels (B). Plans are made to re-establish the old train route to Lanaken (B). If this connections is to be made again, Maastricht will be accessible from all directions by train.\nA few kilometres north of Maastricht, is the Maastricht Aachen Airport. That's the second airport of The Netherlands. \nAreas.\nMaastricht is divided into many areas. The areas \"Heer\", \"Amby\", \"St. Pieter\", and \"Wolder\" used to be individual villages, but are now (for a few decades) part of Maastricht. According to the Dutch central bureaus of statistics (\"Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek; CBS\"), Maastricht can be divided into seven larger districts.

It separates the Aegean Sea from the rest of the Mediterranean Sea.\nLike the Fertile Crescent, Crete had rich soil, a warm climate, and plenty of water. With less time spent fighting to live, the Cretans began to make complicated things. From the wild crocus flowers which covered their island, the Cretans collected saffron used in yellow dye, in food, and in medicine. From the Egyptians, they received rich cloth and jewels. From the Hittites, they learned how to use iron. From the wealthy Lydians, they learned to use money. From Phoneicia, the Cretans received the alphabet which is used today.\nIn various later centuries the island was ruled in turn by ancient Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Venetians, Turks, and modern Greeks. \nCretan capital.\nCretans chose kings to rule over them for seven years each. The king was known as \"Minos\", and the people \"Minoans\". The capital of Crete was Knossos (nos' us). Beautiful friezes (decorating bands) were on the walls. The symbol of the double-ax was used, and is thought to represent the power of a king. The throne was only a seat with a high back, and the nobles had only benches to sit on. However, the benches were covered with red and white plaster. On the walls were painted fish, dolphins, and seaweed. The queen had her own private staircase so she could go upstairs without bothering the men. Several rooms in the palace had jars which were six feet tall, and were used to keep wheat, oil, dye and other things.\nCretan life.\nReligion.\nOn Crete the Minoan Culture started 4700 years ago. The palace of Knossos is well-known and is a labyrinth. Visitors were lost in the labyrinth unless they used a string behind them to find their way back. In this place, it was said that a Minotaur, half bull and half man, lived. Every year seven young men and seven girls were sacrificed to the Minotaur. Many scholars think sacrifices to a bull were made because the Cretans thought the sound of an earthquake was an angry bull.\nThe Cretans also worshiped the Great Mother Cybele, or Snake Goddess. Often, her picture was carved in statues with gold decorations and with snakes curled around the arms. Snakes were thought to protect houses, so each home had a special room for snakes. Sometimes a little table with grooves cut into it was put in a comfortable place so snakes could sip some milk from a cup.\nGames and art.\nThe Cretans loved games, food, athletics, music, and beautiful clothes. They were the first people to build stone theaters where many people were amused by parades and music. Girls could even help bullfighters. In bullfighting, the Minoans did not kill the bull, but the male fighter had to grab the horns of an attacking bull, throw himself on the back of the animal, and then land on the ground; the girl helped the bullfighter keep his balance.\nClothes.\nWomen wore long, full skirts with very tiny waists, complicated hairstyles, and lots of jewelry. The men wore small belts around their waists. They shaved with stones, rubbed their teeth with pumice stone, and had their body hair burnt by a barber.\nFood.\nThe Cretans ate fish, birds, and beef. They had barley cooked in many ways and ate lots of cheese, nuts, and honey. They thought only uncivilized people drank cow's milk, so they drank goat's milk instead. The Cretans sang, played games, and guessed riddles. Even though they ate with their fingers, they had the food cut into tiny pieces before it was served.\nCretan conquest.\nThe Cretans were peaceful people without fortifications to protect them from an attack. In about 1450 B.C., the Greek Mycenaeans captured Crete, after Knossos, Crete's capital, had been shaken by an earthquake."}

Some women were accused of being witches. People thought that witches can do harm to others. So these women were arrested and put in prison.\nIn 1597 Anton Praetorius protested against the torture of women accused of witchcraft.\nPraetorius was so shocked about the torture of the accused woman that he demanded a stop. His protest was successful.\nIn 1598 he wrote a book to protest against torture and the prosecution of witches. The book was published again in 1602, 1613 and in 1629. Praetorius described the terrible situation of the prisoners and protested against torture.\nTheological argument against witchcraft.\nPraetorius was a Protestant minister. He believed that man can do either good or bad things. However, God chooses certain people to do certain things. Those things can be good or bad. According to Praetorius, witchcraft can only be a fall from the favour of God, and a pact with the devil. But, neither the devil nor sorcerers can do more than is in their nature (and predestination). God will punish those who are witches or sorcerers. This however, does not give human courts a right to put those to death, they believe are guilty of the crime of witchcraft. For Praetorius, witchcraft cannot exist, because it is beyond the faculties of either man or the devil. It is also against Nature."}

It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, a so-called subsurface (below the surface) ocean, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm.\nThe moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609.

People use them to get to where they want to go. This means there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big cities have taxis.\nIn most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route. Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go.\nRiding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport.\nHistory.\nThe first taxi-type system started in Paris and London in the early 17th century. These were carts pulled by (carriages) and could be hired. The monarchies that ruled these cities controlled the rules. In the 19th century, Hansom cabs were mostly used because of their higher level of safety.\nTaximeter.\nThe 1891 invention by German Wilhelm Bruhn of the taximeter helped establish the modern taxi. The first modern meter-equipped taxicab was the Daimler Victoria, built by Gottlieb Daimler in 1897. The first motorized taxi company began operating in Stuttgart the same year.\nThe term \"taximeter\" is an adaptation of the French word 'taxim\u00e8tre', and the German word 'taxameter'. It means measuring a tax or fee."}

It is in the county of Sussex. It is a place where people go on holiday and also where non-English speakers go to learn English. It is at the eastern end of the chalk hills called the South Downs, and next to the high cliff at Beachy Head. The town was built in the early 19th century for people to visit the seaside. A railway station was built in 1849.\nGeography.\nEastbourne lies next to chalk hills called the South Downs. The famous chalk cliffs Beachy Head is in the town. Eastbourne's architecture and buildings are mainly from the Victorian and Georgian periods. Eastbourne has recently built a marina called Sovereign Harbour which makes the town bigger.\nCensus.\nEastbourne's population was approximately 97,992 in 2009.\nMost jobs in Eastbourne are in tourism or tourism-related services.\nPolitics.\nAs of 7 May 2015, the MP for Eastbourne is Caroline Ansell. She is a member of the Conservatives.\nEastbourne Borough Council has 27 members (called councillors). Currently, there are 15 Conservative councillors, 11 Liberal Democrat councillors and one independent councillor. The leader of the council is Councillor Ian Lucas.\nHistory.\nThere have been people living in the Eastbourne area since 4000BC, but the town did not develop until around 1150AD. St. Mary's Church (now in Eastbourne's Old Town) was first built between 1160 and 1190. Eastbourne was strategically important during the Napoleonic Wars and had a Martello Tower built from 1804 to 1810. The tower is one of few Martello Towers that are still standing, and is now called the Wish Tower.\nThe town became much bigger after a railway station was built there in 1849. It joined Eastbourne to London, Brighton and the South Coast Railway. From 1858, William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Burlington (later 7th Duke of Cavendish) invested a lot of money into the town. The elegant areas of Meads, Devonshire Park and the Western Parades were developed as a result of his investment. Cavendish's influence is recognised by many place and business names in Eastbourne, for example: the Cavendish School, the Burlington Hotel, or the Devonshire Park Theatre.\nEastbourne Pier was first built in 1865. It is a famous symbol of Eastbourne and today houses amusement arcades, a nightclub and a public house. It also has a rare, working camera obscura. "}

Later the city was under Austrian domination until the first years of the 20th century, when Italian irredentism was very strong in Trieste.\nIndeed, together with Trento, Trieste was the main focus of the Italian irredentist movement, which aimed for the annexation to Italy of all the lands they claimed were inhabited by an Italian speaking population. Many local Italians enrolled voluntarily in the Royal Italian Army during WWI (a notable example is the writer Scipio Slataper).\nThe population of Trieste, practically nearly all Italian, promoted this union of the city to Italy in 1918, and since the end of WWI the city has been the capital of the Italian region called \"Venezia Giulia\".\nThe population is 207.069 ab. (2004). It was nearly 300,000 after WWII because many Italian refugees flooded the city as a consequence of the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus.\nThese days, Trieste is important because of its shipbuilding industry, science parks, universities and \"history on the border of western Europe\". Trieste will be connected to the Italian \"TAV railway\" (High Speed) network: a 300\u00a0km/hour (186 mph) fast train route is going to connect Trieste with Venice in the next few years.\nEconomy.\nDuring the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste became a leading European city in economy, trade and commerce, and was the fourth largest and most important center in the Empire, after Vienna, Budapest and Prague. However the economy of Trieste fell into a small decline after the city's annexation to Italy following World War I, because was cut off from the \"Mittleurope\".\nBut Fascist Italy promoted a huge development of Trieste in the 1930s, with new manufacturing activities related even to naval and armament industries (like the famous \"Cantieri Aeronautici Navali Triestini (CANT)\"). Allied bombings during WWII destroyed the industrial section of the city (mainly the shipyards).\nAs a consequence Trieste was a mainly peripheral city during the Cold War. However, since the 1970s, Trieste has had a huge economic boom, thanks to a significant commercial shipping business to the container terminal, steel works and an oil terminal.\nTrieste is also Italy's and Mediterranean's (and one of Europe's) greatest coffee ports, as the city supplies more than 40% of Italy's coffee. Coffee brands, such as Illy, were founded and are headquartered in the city. Currently, Trieste is one of Europe's most important ports and centres for trade and transport, with Trieste being part of the \"Corridor 5\" plan, to create a bigger transport connection between Western and Eastern European countries."}

It is in the district of Hildesheim and is about 30\u00a0km southeast of Hanover. The city is on the banks of the River Innerste, which is a smaller river that flows into the River Leine. It can be reached from Autobahn A7, which links Kassel, G\u00f6ttingen and Hanover.\nIt has about 110,000 people living there.\nHistory.\nHildesheim is one of the oldest cities in North Germany. The city may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the Innerste ford, where it was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement soon grew into a town which was granted market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market (\"Alter Markt\"), which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew's Church. As the city grew larger, a larger market place became more important. The current market place in Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had a population of about 5,000. When Hildesheim obtained city rights in 1249, it was one of the largest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268, and in 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud. Hildesheim became Protestant in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well. In 1813, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 as a province.\nThe city was bombed in World War II, but the bombing had little importance in the course of the war. 28.5% of the houses were destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses had no damage. The center, which still had its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Fortunately, most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall. In 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic center began. Some of the new concrete buildings near the marketplace were torn down. Replicas of the original buildings were built in their place.\nPopulation history.\n\u00b9 census data"}

This district was mentioned in a document for the first time in the year 995. Four years later, in 999, the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III gave this district to his sister Adelheid, who was an abbess in Quedlinburg.\nIn the center of this area, the \"provincia Gera\", a town with the same name was established. Another document, which is from the year 1237, said for the first time that there was a town called Gera. In this town, the abbesses of Quedlinburg had some officials which were called the \"V\u00f6gte\" of Gera. These officials were the ancestors of the counts and princes of Reu\u00df, which reigned in Gera for many years, until the year 1918.\nIn the early modern period, Gera was famous for making textiles. There were some fires in which a lot of the town was destroyed, for example in 1686 and in 1780. In 1806, Napoleon was in Gera before the Battle of Jena.\nIn the 19th century, Gera became an important city of industry. Before that, Gera was a quite small town, but in the year 1900, it had already about 45,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1920, Thuringia was founded as a state of the Weimar Republic. Gera was the biggest city of the state, because Erfurt was not yet a part of Thuringia. At the end of World War II, some parts of Gera were destroyed by bombs, for example the Osterstein Castle.\nAfter World War II, Gera was in the Soviet Occupation Zone and then in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). From 1952 to 1990, it was the capital of the Gera District (\"Bezirk Gera\") of the GDR.\nSince the German Reunification in 1990, Gera belongs to the Free State of Thuringia in the Federal Republic of Germany.\nPopulation.\nSince 1959, Gera has had more than 100,000 inhabitants. The highest number of inhabitants of Gera was 134,834 in the year 1988. Since the German Reunification, the number of inhabitants becomes smaller and smaller. Now there are fewer people who live in Gera than in Jena, so Gera is only the third-biggest city in Thuringia. On 31 December 2008, there were only 100,643 people living in Gera.\nTwin towns.\nGera has got twelve twin towns. Eleven of them are in Europe.\nPeople.\nThese famous people were born in Gera:"}

It is one of the best universities in the United States as U.S. News &amp; World Report, a magazine, puts it at number 108. Most students of this university focus on science or technology as their major, or subject they study most. IIT was created in 1940 by the merger of the Armour Institute of Technology and Lewis Institute.\nArchitecture.\nThe campus, roughly bounded between 31st and 35th streets, Michigan Avenue and the Dan Ryan Expressway, was designed by modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, \"one of the great figures of 20th-century architecture\", who chaired the IIT School of Architecture from 1938 to 1958. Van der Rohe's master plan for the IIT campus was one of the most ambitious projects he ever conceived. The campus has twenty of his works. It is the greatest concentration of his buildings in the world. The layout of the campus departs radically from \"traditional college quadrangles and limestone buildings\". The materials are inspired by the factories and warehouses of Chicago's South Side and \"embod[y] 20th century methods and materials: steel and concrete frames with curtain walls of brick and glass.\" \nAlfred Caldwell designed the campus landscape. Caldwall was van der Rohe's close colleague at IIT and was called \"the last representative of the Prairie School of landscape architects.\" Known as \"the nature poet\", Caldwell's plan reinforced van der Rohe's design with \"landscaping planted in a free-flowing manner, which in its interaction with the pristine qualities of the architecture, introduce[d] a poetic aspect.\"\nOn the west side of Main Campus are three red brick buildings that were original to Armour Institute, built between 1891 and 1901. In 1938, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe began his 20-year tenure as director of IIT's School of Architecture (1938\u20131959). The university was on the verge of building a brand new campus, to be one of the nation's first federally funded urban renewal projects. Mies was given great freedom in the large project. The university grew fast enough during and after World War II to allow much of the new plan to be realized. From 1943 to 1957, several new Mies buildings rose across campus, including the S.R. Crown Hall, which houses the architecture school, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001.\nThough Mies had emphasized his wish to complete the campus he had begun, commissions from the late 50s onward were given to Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM), prompting Mies to never return to the campus that had changed architecture the world over. SOM architect Walter Netsch designed a few buildings, including the new library that Mies had wished to create, all of them similar to Mies's style. By the late 1960s, campus addition projects were given to SOM's Myron Goldsmith, who had worked with Mies during his education at IIT and thus was able to design several new buildings to harmonize well with the original campus. In 1976, the American Institute of Architects recognized the campus as one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States. The new campus center, designed by Rem Koolhaas, and a new state-of-the-art residence hall designed by Helmut Jahn, State Street Village, opened in 2003. These were the first new buildings built on the Main Campus in 32 years.\nIn 1976, American Institute of Architects named the IIT campus one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States. The IIT Main Campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005."}

The bookshelf behind Freud's desk contains some of his favourite authors: not only Goethe and Shakespeare but also Heine, Multatuli and Anatole France. Freud acknowledged that poets and philosophers had gained insights into the unconscious which psychoanalysis sought to explain systematically. \nThe room contains the original analytic couch brought from Berggasse 19. On this patients would recline comfortably while Freud, out of sight in the green tub chair, listened to their 'free association'. They were asked to say everything that came to mind without consciously sifting or selecting information. This method became a foundation upon which psychoanalysis was built.\nAntiquities.\nThe study is filled with antiquities from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Orient. There are some fine masks and carving from Africa. Freud visited many archaeological sites (though not Egypt). Most of the collection was got from dealers in Vienna. \nHe confessed that his passion for collecting was second only to his addiction to cigars. The importance of the collection can be seen in Freud's use of archaeology as a metaphor for psychoanalysis. One example of this is Freud's explanation to a patient that conscious material 'wears away' while what is unconscious is relatively unchanging: \"I illustrated my remarks by pointing to the antique objects about my room. They were, in fact, I said, only objects found in a tomb, and their burial had been their preservation\".\nThe collection includes a portrait of Freud by Salvador Dal\u00ed."}

It is native to Australia. The emu is the tallest bird from Australia. It is also the second tallest bird in the world, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. The emu is also related to the cassowary which is slightly smaller but heavier. It should also be noted, as an odd fact, that the Emus won a war against Australia. \nOther emus.\nThere were four separate groups of emus in 1788 when the European settlers arrived. The emus on the mainland of Australia and those on the island of Tasmania may have been different species. \nThere were also two species of dwarf emu, \"Dromaius minor\", one living on King Island in Tasmania and the other on Kangaroo Island. They are examples of island dwarfism. The group on King Island became extinct in 1805, that on Kangaroo Island in 1827, and that in Tasmania in 1865.\nDescription.\nThe soft-feathered, brown birds reach up to in height. Their feathers are in a double layer which helps keep the emu cool. They have bare skin on the sides of the face and their neck. They can weigh up to . They have two large legs, with three toes on each foot. Their wings are very short, about \n, and are hidden under their feathers.\nThey can live up to 10\u201320 years \nThe emu is common over most of mainland Australia. It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot. If necessary they can run at up to for some distance at a time. They may travel long distances to find food. One emu was found to have traveled .\nDiet.\nThey feed on a variety of plants (seeds, flowers, new growth) and insects. Because of their size they need to eat a lot.\nBreeding.\nEmus are solitary birds. However, the young chicks stay with the father until they are 18 months of age. The breeding season is between February and July, when the female can lay between 5-15 eggs in a ground nest built by the male. The male then sits on the eggs for 8 weeks until hatching. The baby chicks have very clear stripes on the feathers which act as camouflage.\nOn the east coast of Australia, emus were once common but have become uncommon with increased human population. On the other hand, the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid (dry) regions. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and leather. The first emu farms began in Western Australia during the 1970s.\nIn captivity.\nThere are approximately 1100 emus in zoos.\nThe history of the name.\nThe first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillip's \"Voyage to Botany Bay\", published in 1789. The species was named by ornithologist (bird expert) John Latham, who worked on Phillip's book. He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species. Its scientific name, Dromaius novaehollandiae, is from the Latin words, meaning \"fast-footed New Hollander\". The history of the common name, \"emu\", is not certain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird. This word was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea. In Victoria, some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were \"Barrimal\" in the Djadja wurrung language, \"myoure\" in Gunai, and \"courn\" in Jardwadjali."}

In their territory they build several small caves where they sleep, or lay their eggs.\nKiwi are monogamous; the male and female stay together until one of them dies. The male and female live in the same territory and raise their children together.\nFemale kiwi lay 1-3 eggs. Compared to the size of the mother, the eggs are the largest of any bird species. Kiwi are mature when they are 2 years old, and they can live more than 20 years. One kiwi kept in a zoo even reached 35 years old.\nEggs.\nThe female brown kiwi lays enormous eggs, which are almost one-sixth of her own body weight. These eggs take 11 weeks to incubate, the longest time for any bird. In comparison, Yellow-breasted Chats' eggs take only 11 days, and chickens' eggs take 21 days.\nHabitat.\nKiwi prefer to live in burrows they make in forested areas. They either make their burrows in the ground like rabbits, in between the roots of trees, or in hidden sheltered places such as hollow logs. Kiwi line their burrows with leaves to make them more comfortable and warm. Sometimes they hide the entrance to their burrows using piles of twigs. Kiwi may have more than ten different burrows in their territory and will swap between them sometimes. \nKiwi are threatened by many mammals. Stoats are the main threat for the kiwi chicks. Ferrets and dogs kill adult kiwi."}

Dodos were in the same family as the pigeon. They were endemic to (only lived on) the island of Mauritius. They became extinct in the late 17th century. \nThe Dodo has become a symbol of extinction caused by the arrival of humans in ecosystems where humans had never before lived.\nThe name 'Dodo'.\nThe history of the word 'Dodo' is not clear. Dutch admiral Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 during an expedition to Indonesia. He called the bird 'walgvogel', meaning \"disgusting bird\" because he disliked the taste of the meat. Four years later, the Dutch captain, Willem van Westsanen, used the word 'Dodo' for the first time.\nThe \"Encarta Dictionary\" and the \"Chambers Dictionary of Etymology\" say \"dodo\" is a Portuguese word, coming from \"doido\". It means \"fool\" or \"crazy\". Another idea is that 'dodo' was a copy of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeon like sound, \"doo-doo\". \nIn 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote a description of the Dodo, and of other animal and plants on the island .\nDescription.\nThe dodo was a large bird and weighed about . They had grey feathers and yellow feet. Their big hooked bill was a green/yellow color. It had short wings that were only stubs. They ate fruit, seeds and nuts. Portuguese sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish. They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food. They are eaten by humans who come in the search of treasure or spouting.\nExtinction.\nThe dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill. Dogs, cats, rats and pigs were left on the island and also killed the dodos. Because dodos built their nests on the ground, the new animals ate their eggs. The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its habitat. Within 80 years, the dodo was extinct.\nThe last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish. Only a foot and a head are left. The American Museum of Natural History in New York has a skeleton showing. It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos. The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a dodo, found in a swamp."}

It is a set of theories and ways of treating mental disorders. It was started in the early 1890s by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, with experience from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others.\nSince then, psychoanalysis has expanded and been revised, reformed and developed in different ways. Freud's own colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, had their own ideas. They went on to develop their ideas independently from Freud. Much later, Anna Freud and Melanie Klein used the ideas to treat troubled children.\nThe basic ideas of psychoanalysis are:\nThe unconscious mind.\nSometimes people cannot say why they are feeling the way they feel or acting the way they act. What causes the feelings and actions is called the unconscious mind in psychodynamic theory.\nDifferent methods.\nUnder the broad umbrella of \"psychoanalysis\" there are at least 22 different approaches to the theory and clinical treatment. The term also refers to a method of studying child development.\nFreudian psychoanalysis uses a type of treatment where the subject (analytic patient) talks, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams. From these the analyst works out the unconscious conflicts which cause the patient's symptoms and character problems. By interpreting them for the patient, the analyst creates insight into the problems. The analyst identifies and clarifies the patient's pathological defences, wishes and guilt.\nPsychoanalysis has been criticized on many fronts. It has been called a pseudoscience, and lacking in empirical support. However, it remains influential within psychiatry, more so in some quarters than others."}

Traditionally they were always made of wood, although some of them are now made of metal or plastic.\nIn an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument. Each of these also has related instruments of different sizes:\nThe piccolo is the highest of the four main instruments. The lowest note is Middle C and it has a range of 3 octaves. The piccolo is the smallest and highest instrument in the orchestra. It plays one octave higher than the flute. There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute. Flutes are still sometimes made of wood, but mostly they are metal.\nThe oboe can play slightly lower than the flute. There is a larger version called the cor anglais (which means: \u201cEnglish horn\u201d). This is a double reeded instrument. The clarinet plays nearly an octave lower than the flute. The bass clarinet plays an octave lower than the clarinet. The bassoon is the lowest of the four.\nThe recorder is one of the oldest and most popular woodwinds and has been used to great effect by greats, such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi. The general public is normally only familiar with the plastic, child's version of the recorder, but professional and high-quality recorders are still made of wood.\nThe saxophone may look like a brass instrument, but it is played like a clarinet and therefore it is a woodwind instrument. It is usually played in bands and jazz groups.\nUse.\nWoodwind instruments are played in several ways. The flute is played by blowing across the top of the mouthpiece. It is like blowing across the top of an empty bottle. The oboe and bassoon both have a double reed. It is like blowing through a drinking straw. Bagpipes have double reeds which are inside the mouthpiece (\u201cenclosed reeds\u201d). The clarinet and saxophone have single reeds which are clamped against the opening of the mouthpiece.\nIn comparison, brass instruments are all blown in the same way: by blowing against a cup-shaped mouthpiece. This is why the saxophone cannot be called a brass instrument, although it is made of brass.\nThe way that a player shapes his mouth to blow an instrument is called the \u201cembouchure\u201d. Woodwind instruments have several different embouchures.\nIn an orchestra there may be two each of flutes, oboes, clarinets and bassoons. In larger orchestras, particularly from the Romantic period onwards, there may be three or four. Sometimes the extra instruments such as the piccolo are used. If, for example, in an orchestral piece the third flute is marked \u201cdoubling piccolo\u201d, it means that the person playing flute 3 will also play the piccolo. However, if the piccolo plays at the same time as flute 3 they will obviously need an extra player for the piccolo part.\nWoodwind instruments in an orchestra often have short solos. These will be played by the first player (the \u201csection principal\u201d)."}

It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was first released on October 23, 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures. The fourth movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, \"Dumbo\" is based upon a child's book of the same name by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Perl. The main character is Jumbo Jr., a baby elephant who is cruelly nicknamed Dumbo. He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of flying by using them as wings. Throughout most of the movie, his only true friend aside from his mother is the mouse Timothy, making fun of the stereotype between mice and elephants. \"Dumbo\" was made to make up for the damages of \"Pinocchio\" and \"Fantasia\". The movie has been criticized in recent years as being \"racist\" (the leader crow in the movie was named \"Jim Crow\" and at some point in the 1950s was renamed \"Dandy Crow\" in attempt to avoid controversy, but the original name is still the one mostly known, although it was supposed to be just a sarcastic mockery to the Jim Crow laws in the Southern USA back then and was used only on the character's model sheets), yet is also considered to be one of Disney's best movies. It was an attempt to be simple and make profits for the Disney studio, is now generally regarded as a classic of animation. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features.\nThe story.\nFlorida, 1941. Mrs. Jumbo sadly looks on how babies are delivered by the stork to other circus animals. As even a baby elephant makes a pretty heavy package, hers is the last to arrive, but soon becomes the laughing stock of the others because of his big ears, getting meanly named \"Dumbo\" by the others. When Mrs. Jumbo can not take the public making fun of her son, she is locked up as \"mad elephant\", and Dumbo finds himself all alone. A mouse named Timothy comes and scares the mean herd. He encourages Dumbo and tells the circus director to make Dumbo the top (literally) of an elephant pyramid stunt which ends up literally bringing the house down, and Dumbo is given the job of \"baby clown\" in a repetitive, humiliating and dangerous number as punishment. To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy brings him to go see his mother. The next morning, they find themselves up in a tree with a bunch of crows, who discover that Dumbo can fly.\nCrew.\nUncredited:\nCharacters.\nDumbo the Flying Elephant.\nDumbo is the main character in the movie. He is a fictional anthropomorphic elephant who has really big ears. He can fly using his big ears. Similar to Dopey from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and Gideon in \"Pinocchio\", Dumbo has no spoken dialogue. However, in the live-action/puppet television series \"Dumbo's Circus\", Dumbo was voiced by Katie Leigh.\nIn the movie, Dumbo is delivered by Mr. Stork, and is made fun of for the strange size of his ears. As his mother, Mrs. Jumbo, beats up the bullies who pick on her baby, the ringmaster has his helpers chain her up and lock her up in a trailer, which says: \"MAD ELEPHANT\". It is then that Timothy Q. Mouse looks after Dumbo. The two of them try to make Dumbo famous and get his mother free. Thanks to the help of a \"magic feather\" from some crows\ufffc\ufffc, Dumbo flies to fame, and gets his mother free.\nTimothy the Mouse.\nTimothy Q. Mouse is a mouse who became the only friend of elephants Dumbo and his mother Mrs. Jumbo. He teaches Dumbo how to become the ninth wonder of the universe, and the only flying elephant in the whole world.\nMrs. Jumbo.\nMrs. Jumbo is Dumbo's mother. Deeply depressed at not having her baby delivered, she loves her son more than anything. She becomes angry when the boys pick on him.\nOther characters include the other elephants who also make fun of Dumbo, the Ringmaster, the clowns of the circus, the Pink Elephants, Mr. Stork and the Crows who give Dumbo the \"magic feather\" and teach him to fly.\nRelease.\nEven though World War II was going on, \"Dumbo\" was still the most financially successful Disney movie of the 1940s. This was one of the first of Disney's animated movies to be broadcast, albeit severely edited, on television, as part of Disney's anthology series. The movie then received another distinction of note in 1981, when it was the first of Disney's canon of animated movies to be released on home video and also was released in the \"Walt Disney Classics\" Video Collection in 1985. That release was followed by remastered versions in: 1986, 1989, 1991 (Classics), and 1994 (Masterpiece). In 2001, a 60th Anniversary Special Edition was released that has original RKO titles. In 2006, a \"Big Top Edition\" of the movie was released on DVD that also has original RKO titles. A UK Special Edition was released in May 2007 and was a successful Disney release.\nReception.\nThe movie received very good reviews and did well at the box office despite being released less than 2 months before \"World War II\".\nIt also has been known as both a classic and a masterpiece, and has received a Special Edition 60th Anniversary Disney DVD on October 23, 2001, exatly 60 years after its first release. That release featured a sneak peek of a direct-to-video sequel called Dumbo II. The preview showed a lot of sketches and storyboard ideas. The main story has to do with Dumbo and his new friends getting separated from the rest of the circus as they wonder into the big city. Dumbo's new friends are Claude and Lolly the twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go, Dot the curious zebra, Godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself, and Penny the adventurous ostrich. Timothy returns as well. The story was supposed to be as if the first Dumbo ended and this one started the next day. The project seems to have been canceled,as no further announcements have been made since, plus the fact that The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, Tinker Bell, and its sequels, were to be the last projests for DisneyToon Studios.\nThe crow characters in the movie are often seen as African-American stereotypes.\nThe leader crow voiced by Cliff Edwards was originally named \"Jim Crow\" for script purposes. The other crows are all voiced by African-American actors and singers, all members of the Hall Johnson Choir: Nick Stewart, James Baskett, Jim Carmichael and Hall Johnson. The late famous duo of African-American dancers Freddie and Eugene Jackson were invited and hired by Disney to work as live-action reference and models for the animators of the characters, like the chief-animator and Disney Legend Ward Kimball, improvising dances and movements then used in the iconic musical sequence \"When I See An Elephant Fly\". Despite suggestions of racism by writers like Richard Schickel, many historians, critics, writers, pundits and personalities such as John Grant, Leonard Maltin, John Canemaker, Floyd Norman, Eric Goldberg, Alex Wainer, Michael Wilmington, Whoopi Goldberg and Neal Gabler reject these claims. For instance, the crows are noted as forming the majority of the characters in the movie who are empathetic and sympathetic to Dumbo's plight (the others are Timothy Q. Mouse and Mrs Jumbo), they are free spirits who serve nobody, and intelligent characters aware of the power of self-confidence and of what means being ostracized and marginalized, unlike the Stepin Fetchit stereotype common at that time and in the previous decade. Furthermore, their song \"When I See An Elephant Fly\" is more orientated to mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbo's large ears.\nMedia and marketing.\nDumbo's Circus.\n\"Dumbo's Circus\" was a live-action puppet television programme for preschool audiences that aired on The Disney Channel in the 1980s. Unlike in the movie, Dumbo spoke on the show. Each character would perform a special act, which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes.\nTheme parks.\nDumbo the Flying Elephant is a popular ride that appears in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park (Paris), and Hong Kong Disneyland.\nVideo games.\nDumbo appears as a hero in the game Kingdom Hearts. Sora, the main character, flies on him and Dumbo splashes enemies with water from his trunk."}

For that reason, the Bild-Zeitung, an very conservative yellow press newspaper, started a campaign against him.\nIn the late 1970s, he started to look for Human Rights in the Eastern Blok, where some friends of his lived, too. He helped the Soviet dissidents Alexander Solshenizyn and Lev Kopelev.\nIn the 1980s, he worked for the peace movement. He protested against the nuclear armament in West Germany.\nHe went back to the Roman Catholic Church, which he left 1976 by protests, before he died.\nHeinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation.\nThe Green Party of Germany gave its foundation the name of B\u00f6ll, Heinrich-B\u00f6ll-Stiftung. The goals of the foundation are for countries to work together, civil laws and democratic and ecological thinking.\nSelected bibliography.\nTranslations.\nMore than seventy translations of Annemarie and Heinrich B\u00f6ll are listed in the bibliography published in 1995 by Werner Bellmann: poetical works of , , , , , , et al."}

{"id": "33005", "revid": "6728464", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33005", "title": "Bassoon", "text": "The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instrument of the woodwind family. Like the oboe, it has a double reed. The reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a \"crook\" or \"bocal\" which is joined to the main part of the instrument. This consists of two parts called \u2018bass joint\u2019 and \u2018wing joint\u2019 (or \u2018tenor joint\u2019). These two are joined at the bottom by a U-shaped piece called the \u2018boot\u2019. At the top of the instrument is the \u2018bell joint\u2019. The instrument is quite heavy. Some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight, but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and goes across the floor. The bassoonist, a person who plays a bassoon, then sits on that strap. The bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip. The bassoon, when played right, can sound very beautiful. The bassoon has one of the largest note ranges, going from low B flat to a high F on the top line of the treble clef. The bassoon can also play in tenor clef, but usually plays bass clef.\nSome bassoons have a white, ivory ring round the top of the bell joint. These are German bassoons (called \u2018Heckel\u2019). French bassoons (called \u2018Buffet\u2019) do not have this ring, and also sound quite different to German bassoons. Bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes, but these keys do not use the Boehm fingering system like the other woodwind instruments. German bassoons use a system called the Heckel system, and French bassoons use the Buffet system..\nThe Bassoon is usually seen as a comical instrument, however it provides a very important role in the orchestra.In fact, the Saxophone was invented to replace the Bassoon and Oboe, however, was rejected because it didn't sound the same in the orchestra.\nPlaying the bassoon.\nTo play the bassoon, it is very important to have lots of breathing support. Like with the oboe, fast passages can be played using double tonguing (single tonguing is like saying \u201ctu-tu-tu-tu-tu\u201d, double tonguing is like saying \u201cte-ke-te-ke-te-ke\u201d). In most music, the bassoon will spend a lot of time playing a bass line, perhaps the same notes as the cello or tuba. It can sometimes sound quite amusing when playing an \u201cum-cha-um-cha\u201d accompaniment like in the \u201cDance of the Cygnets\u201d from Tchaikovsky\u2019s \"Swan Lake\". It can sound very tuneful and sad as in the second movement of Rimsky Korsakov\u2019s \"Sheherazade\". Listen to the opening of Stravinsky\u2019s \"Rite of Spring\" where it plays some quite high notes to fool people that it is the Cor anglais or the English Horn. Even a famous composer, Saint Sa\u00ebns, did not know what the instrument was. Prokofiev uses the bassoon for grandfather\u2019s tune in \"Peter and the Wolf\". Also, to play the bassoon, a player needs big hands because the bassoon's keys and holes are quite wide.\nThe holes are drilled in at an angle so that the upper register is not overblown and produces an unpleasant sound. Whisper keys were also invented to prevent overblowing. The bassoon is known for its reedy sound. Its upper register is shrill and sometimes scary. Middle register could be used for lullabies because of its majestic and soothing tone. Its lower register is deep, dark, and could be used for scary movies and such.\nHistory and repertoire.\nThe bassoon developed from a renaissance instrument called the \"curtal\" or \"dulcian\". These were double reed instruments which often played with shawms. In the Baroque period the bassoon became popular as an instrument to play the bass line, perhaps playing the same as the cello. A man named Hotteterre made many parts of the modern bassoon. In the late Baroque period composers like Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for bassoon and orchestra. Some more famous bassoon concertos include one by Mozart, and in more recent times by Peter Maxwell Davies. The bassoon was a very important instrument in the orchestra. Mozart and Beethoven gave the bassoon important parts in the music.\nContrabassoon.\nIn some pieces with a large orchestra a contrabassoon is used. This plays an octave lower than a bassoon, taking it right down to bottom B flat or C on the piano. Some contrabassoons are made to play a note lower, i.e. the very lowest note of the piano (A). One might expect to see the contrabassoon sticking up high above all the other instruments in the orchestra, but in fact the tube keeps doing U-turns, making four parallel rows of tubing. They are usually made with the bell pointing downwards. The weight is supported by a peg to the floor. The contrabassoon used to be shaped like a bassoon.\nThe contrabassoon adds richness to the sound of a full orchestra. Listen carefully for the contrabassoon in the hymn-like introduction to the last movement of \"Symphony no 1\" by Brahms. It can be clearly heard, growling away, in the opening of the \"Piano Concerto for the Left Hand\" by Ravel."}

The scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast. For example: if someone plays Middle C on a piano, a hammer hits the Middle C strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second. The C an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second. \nYoung children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand, if their hands are too small. Most adults can stretch an octave easily (playing one note with the thumb, and the other with the little finger). Advanced pianists can practice."}

It breathes water and lives in the water. Tadpoles hatch from small eggs.\nFrog eggs are round and toad eggs are laid in long strings. Like bird eggs, they have nutrients (food) inside them for the young animal to grow before it hatches.\nMovement.\nTadpoles swim by lateral undulation: their tails move side to side, not up and down. \nFood.\nMost types of tadpole eat only plants, for example algae on rocks. Some types of tadpole eat plants and animals, even other smaller tadpoles.\nMetamorphosis.\nAfter some time, the tadpoles begin to grow legs: first the hind legs and then the front legs. Then they are called froglets. Soon after, froglets grow lungs and begin to breathe air and lose their tails. The tail disappears because the cells in the tail gently die. Each tadpole's mouth changes from small to as wide as its head. Its intestines become shorter. They grow larger, and eventually become adults.\nSpecies.\nHow fast or slow the eggs hatch and how fast or slow the tadpole becomes a froglet is different in different frogs. Some tadpoles take months to become frogs. Some stay tadpoles all winter and do not become frogs until the next spring, or even three years later. Some frogs lay their eggs in bodies of water that are only there in the spring and dry up in the summer, so the tadpoles must become frogs in only a few weeks."}

This number is nowadays considered one of his standards as Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears did later an jazzy cover on their album. His biggest hits were during the late 1960s and the 1970s. His songs include \"Me And My Arrow\", \"Coconut\", \"Cuddly Toy\", \"Spaceman\", and \"One\". \"One\" was also a hit for the band Three Dog Night. Nilsson's two most famous songs were \"Without You\" and \"Everybody's Talkin'\". These songs were written by other people. \"Without You\" has been re-recorded many times by other singers. It was written by Peter Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger. \"Everybody's Talkin'\" was used in the 1969 movie \"Midnight Cowboy\". The song was written by Fred Neil.\nNilsson recorded a tribute to The Beatles on his first album. He used lines from fifteen of their songs in one cover version of \"You Can't Do That\". Derek Taylor, who worked for the Beatles, sent them copies of the album, and Nilsson became a friend of the band. He later shared a house with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. They worked together on each other's music.\nNilsson also wrote a cartoon movie named \"The Point!\". It was broadcast on ABC. It was about tolerance and diversity. \"The Point!\" was later turned into a musical. One production of the musical starred former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones.

It has six strings which pass from tuning pegs over the instrument's neck which is marked with lines called frets. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum (\"pick\"), to make them sound. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles.\nHow the guitar became a popular instrument.\nThe acoustic guitar came from Spain (an instrument with six strings), created by Antonio Torres Jurado. But at the beginning, the guitar was different with what we see the guitar now. In the 16th to 17th centuries, the guitar became popular in Europe. In the 18th century, the guitar changed to be similar to how it is now. But before the 19th century, many people thought the guitar could not be same as a piano or violin. They thought it could not play classical music. But at the beginning of 19th century, a famous guitar player, Fernando Sor, made the guitar become more popular and he made more people like playing the guitar. Before the 20th century, people played the acoustic guitar. In the 20th century, a musician in United States, Leo Fender, invented the electric guitar.\nGuitar and ukulele compared.\nThe guitar and the ukulele are similar in shape and other ways, but they are also different. The ukulele looking like a small guitar. But the guitar has six strings, and the ukulele has just four strings. The six strings in a guitar are tuned: E, B, G, D, A, and E; the four strings in a ukulele are tuned: G, C, E, and A. Also, the ukulele comes from Hawaii, and the guitar comes from Spain."}

It is a language from Slavic language family. It is very similar to Czech, and Czechs and Slovaks understand each other quite well when they speak their own language. Polish and Sorbian are also quite similar. All of them belong to the western branch of Slavic languages. Slovak is spoken by more than 5 million people.\nPronunciation.\nSlovak is written using the Latin alphabet, but some letters have special signs (called diacritics).\nThe letters \u010d, \u0161, \u017e and d\u017e are like the English sounds in \"ch\"in, \"sh\"in, vi\"s\"ion and \"j\"uice.\nThe letters \u010f, \u013e, \u0148, and \u0165 are called \u201csoft consonants\u201d and are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth.\nThe letters c, dz and j are also soft, like \"ts\" in ba\"ts\", \"ds\" in ro\"ds\", and \"y\" in \"y\"es.\nSigns over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long: \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fd \u00fa. A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel.\nThe letter \u00f4 is like English \"wo\"man, and \u00e4 is the same as the letter e.\nThe letter ch is like \"ch\" in Scottish lo\"ch\". V is more like English \"w\".\nThe letters b, d, \u010f, dz, d\u017e, g, h, z, \u017e are voiceless when they are at the end of a word (for example, 'd' will sound like 't').\nThe accent is always on the first syllable of the word. That is different from Russian, for example, in which the stress can be anywhere.\nLike other Slavic languages, Slovak is difficult for English-speakers to pronounce., especially because several consonants often come together. In the sentence: \u201cStr\u010d prst skrz krk!\u201d there is not one single vowel (it means: \u201cStick a finger through your neck!\u201d)!\nGrammar.\nThe grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has the words for \u201cto have\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d:\nUnlike English, Slovak does not have articles (such as \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d).\nThere are three genders in Slovak, therefore it is important to know whether a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. There is no article to make it obvious (unlike in German), but it changes the adjective's ending.\nLike many other European languages, Slovak verbs agree with the person, and there are different forms for 'I', 'you', 'he', etc. Verbs have different aspects to show whether or not the action is complete. There are also different cases that show how a word is used in a sentence. Different prepositions use different cases. All of that makes grammar quite complicated for English-speakers.\nSample words and phrases.\nThe numbers from 1 to 10 are .\nUse the familiar form when talking to a child, and the polite form when talking to an adult."}

They are now owned by Electronic Arts. The game was first officially released in 1989.\nIt was very popular because the game had no end. A player could not win or lose. This was the start of all simulation games.\nGameplay.\nAt the start, the player has to build power plants. Power plants make power so the city can have electricity. By building power lines, power is connected to the different areas of the city. Water needs to be pumped in from a river using pipes to connect them to the city.\nSmaller areas are marked out. These are made either residential, commercial, or industrial zones. Zones are the only places where buildings can develop. Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow.\nRoads, schools and hospitals must all be built for the city to get better. Parks and libraries make more people want to move to the city. Railways and highways provide ways to connect to other neighborhoods.\nSequels.\nAfter the first game, many more were created.

If a person gets badly dehydrated, their body will be unable to work the right way. Bad dehydration can cause organ damage and even death.\nWhat causes dehydration?\nA living organism will get dehydrated if their body is losing water in some way and they do not drink enough to replace the water. The most common causes of dehydration are: \nWho gets dehydration?\nAny living being can get dehydrated. Some people are more at risk of dehydration. Elderly people, very young children, and people with chronic illnesses are at the highest risk for dehydration.\nSymptoms.\nDehydrated people may have different symptoms depending on how dehydrated they are. If dehydration is not treated, it will get worse. As dehydration gets worse, the symptoms get more dangerous.\nWhen people start to get dehydrated, they may have these symptoms: \nWhen dehydration gets severe (very bad), its symptoms include: \nSevere dehydration is a medical emergency. If a person with severe dehydration does not get medical treatment soon enough, they can die.\nWhat problems may dehydration cause?\nBad dehydration can cause serious health problems. Some of these problems are:\nHow is dehydration treated?\nTo fix dehydration, a person has to replace the fluids and electrolytes that they have lost.\nWhen dehydration is not too bad, people can usually treat themselves by drinking. This is called oral rehydration therapy. Stores sell special drinks like Pedialyte and Gatorade, which have both water and electrolytes in them. People can also make their own oral rehydration solution (a drink which treats dehydration) by mixing water with sugar and salt.\nPeople with very bad dehydration need emergency medical treatment. They may need to get fluids intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). This replaces lost fluids and electrolytes much more quickly than drinking.

{"id": "33102", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33102", "title": "Shigeru Miyamoto", "text": " is a Japanese game designer and producer at Nintendo. He created the \"Donkey Kong\", \"Mario\", \"Pikmin\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\" video game series for Nintendo.\nHe is one of the most famous game designers in the world and is often called the father of modern video gaming. His games give players many ways to play and explore. This was unique in video games when his games were first released.\nMiyamoto started working with Nintendo in 1977 as an artist when it was still a toy and playing-card company. In 1980, he designed \"Donkey Kong\", which was a big success. Miyamoto became Nintendo's leading producer, and he continues to create many popular games for Nintendo today Such as entries in the Super Mario and the Zelda series.\nEarly Life.\nMiyamoto was born on November 16, 1952 in the Japanese town of Sonobe, which is a rural town that is northwest of Kyoto. His father taught English language.\nMiyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts with a degree in industrial design. However, he could not find a job. He also loved manga. Before he thought about starting a career in video games, he wanted to become a professional manga artist. Manga's classical kish\u014dtenketsu narrative structure influenced him. Western genre television shows also influenced him. The game that made him want to enter the video game industry was the 1978 arcade game \"Space Invaders\".\nCareer.\n1977\u20131984: Arcade beginnings and \"Donkey Kong\".\nNintendo was a small Japanese company in the late 1970s. They had traditionally sold playing cards and other novelties. However, they started making toys and games in the mid-1960s. Through a mutual friend, Miyamoto's father set up an interview with Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi. After showing some of his toy creations, Miyamoto was hired in 1977 as an apprentice in the planning department.\nMiyamoto became Nintendo's first artist. He helped create the art for Nintendo's first original coin-operated arcade video game, \"Sheriff\". He first helped the company develop a game with the 1980 release \"Radar Scope\". The game had some success in Japan. However, by 1981, Nintendo's efforts to sell it in the North American video game market failed. This left the company with a lot of arcade machines that were not sold. Nintendo was also facing financial ruin. In order to try to keep Nintendo going, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi decided to change unsold \"Radar Scope\" machines into a new arcade game. He asked Miyamoto to do this. Miyamoto said self-deprecatingly that \"no one else was available\" to do the work. Nintendo's head engineer, Gunpei Yokoi, oversaw the project.\nMiyamoto thought of many characters and story ideas, but eventually decided on a love triangle between a gorilla, a carpenter, and a girl. He wanted to create something like what was with comic characters Bluto and Popeye for the woman Olive Oyl. Although, Nintendo tried to get the rights to \"Popeye\", but they failed. Bluto became an ape, a form Miyamoto said was \"nothing too evil or disgusting\". This ape would be the pet of the main character, \"a funny, hang-loose kind of guy.\" Miyamoto also said \"Beauty and the Beast\" and the 1933 film \"King Kong\" influenced him. \"Donkey Kong\" was the first time that the creation of a video game's story came before the actual programming. Usually, the story was added without much care. Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project. However, he did not actually know how to program it himself; instead, he thought of the game's concepts, then asked technicians on whether they were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different ways, and react in various ways. However, Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too difficult. Yokoi suggested using see-saws to catapult the character across the screen; however, this was also too difficult to do. Miyamoto next thought of using sloped platforms and ladders to move the character. He thought of using barrels for obstacles. When he asked that the game have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was basically asking them to make the game repeat, but the team eventually programmed the game. When the game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing, the sales manager did not like how it was different from the maze and shooter games common at the time. When American staffers started naming the characters, they decided on \"Pauline\" for the woman. She was named after Polly James, wife of Nintendo's Redmond, Washington, warehouse manager, Don James. The playable character was first called \"Jumpman\". They changed the name to Mario. He was named after Mario Segale, the warehouse landlord. These character names were written on the American cabinet art and used in advertising. The staff also got an English name for the game. The title was \"Donkey Kong\".\n\"Donkey Kong\" was successful. Miyamoto started to work on sequels \"Donkey Kong Jr.\" in 1982 and \"Donkey Kong 3\" in 1983. In the next game, he changed the \"Donkey Kong\" character Jumpman into Mario. He gave him a brother: Luigi. He named the new game \"Mario Bros.\" Yokoi convinced Miyamoto to give Mario some special powers, namely being able to fall from any height without getting hurt. Mario's look in \"Donkey Kong\"\u2014overalls, a hat, and a thick mustache\u2014led Miyamoto to change parts of the game. He changed it to make Mario look like a plumber instead of a carpenter. Miyamoto thought that New York City would be the best setting for the game. He thought it was the best place because it has a \"maze of subterranean sewage pipes\". The two-player mode and other parts of gameplay were influenced by an earlier video game called \"Joust\". To date, games in the \"Mario Bros.\" series have been released for many consoles. Shortly after, Miyamoto also drew the character sprites and game design for the \"Baseball\", \"Tennis\", and \"Golf\" games on the NES.\n1985\u20131989: NES/Famicom, \"Super Mario Bros.\", and \"The Legend of Zelda\".\nNintendo released its first home video game console, the Family Computer (released in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System). While this happened, Miyamoto created two of the most famous games for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: \"Super Mario Bros.\" (a sequel to \"Mario Bros.\") and \"The Legend of Zelda\" (an entirely original title).\nIn both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores. This was different from most games at the time. \"Super Mario Bros.\" was a linear game. The player moved the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. Miyamoto used nonlinear gameplay in \"The Legend of Zelda\". This requires the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was big and it seemed to never end. It had a lot of different choices and depth never seen before in a video game. With \"The Legend of Zelda\", Miyamoto wanted to make an in-game world that players could relate to. He said it was like a \"small garden that they can put inside their drawer.\" He was influenced from his time as a boy around Kyoto. When he was a boy, he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each \"Zelda\" title has this feeling of exploration. \"When I was a child,\" Miyamoto said, \"I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to find it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, finding amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this.\" He recreated his memories of becoming lost in the maze of sliding doors in his family home in \"Zelda\"s maze-like dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released the game as the first game for the Nintendo Entertainment System's new Disk System.\nMiyamoto worked on different games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. These games included \"Ice Climber\", \"Kid Icarus\", \"Excitebike\", and \"Devil World\". He also worked on sequels to \"Super Mario Bros\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\".\n'Super Mario Bros. 3\" was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development; the game took more than two years to make.\n1990\u20132000: SNES, Nintendo 64, \"Super Mario 64\", and \"Ocarina of Time\".\nA merger between Nintendo's different internal research and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development (Nintendo EAD). Miyamoto was the head of it. Nintendo EAD had about fifteen months to develop \"F-Zero\", one of the launch titles for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Miyamoto worked on different games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. One of them was \"Star Fox\". For the game, programmer Jez San convinced Nintendo to make an upgrade for the Super Nintendo. This upgrade would allow it to be able to show three-dimensional graphics better. This upgrade was the Super FX chip. Using this new hardware, Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi designed the \"Star Fox\" game with an early use of three-dimensional graphics.\nMiyamoto produced two big \"Mario\" titles for the system. The first game was \"Super Mario World\". It was a launch title. It was included with Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles. It had an overworld as in \"Super Mario Bros.\". It had a new character, Yoshi. Yoshi would go on to be in many other Nintendo games. The second \"Mario\" game for the system was \"Super Mario RPG\". It was different than most \"Mario\" games. Miyamoto led a team that was a partnership between Nintendo and Square Co.; it took almost a year to develop the graphics. The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the \"Super Mario Bros.\" series.\nShigeru Miyamoto helped Satoshi Tajiri. Miyamoto guided him during the creation of \"Pocket Monsters: Red and Green\" (released in English as \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Blue\"), the first video games in the Pok\u00e9mon series. He was also the producer for these games. Miyamoto worked on social gameplay ideas such as trading. Pok\u00e9mon would become one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world, spanning video games, anime, and other merchandise.\nMiyamoto made several games for the Nintendo 64. Most of these games were from his previous franchises. His first game on the Nintendo 64 was \"Super Mario 64\". He was the main director. In developing the game, he started with character design and the camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were unsure of what the game should be like. It took months to decide on a good camera view and layout. The first idea used a fixed path. This would have been similar to an isometric-type game.They decided on a free-roaming 3D design. He changed the design of the Nintendo 64 controller to fit with that of \"Super Mario 64\".\nUsing what he had learned about the Nintendo 64 from developing \"Super Mario 64\" and \"Star Fox 64\", Miyamoto produced his next game, '. He led a team of several directors. Individual parts of \"Ocarina of Time\" were developed by multiple directors\u2014a new strategy for Nintendo EAD. However, when things progressed slower than expected, Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more central role. He was helped in public by interpreter Bill Trinen. The team was new to 3D games. However, assistant director Makoto Miyanaga remembers a feeling of \"passion for creating something new and never done before\". Miyamoto went on to produce a sequel to \"Ocarina of Time\", known as '.\nMiyamoto worked many \"Mario\" series spin-offs for the Nintendo 64. These included \"Mario Kart 64\" and \"Mario Party\".\n2000\u20132011: GameCube, Wii, and DS.\nMiyamoto produced many games for the GameCube. This included the launch title \"Luigi's Mansion\". The game was first shown at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technical demo. It was designed to show off the graphical power of the GameCube. Miyamoto made a short demo of the game concepts. Nintendo decided to make it a full game. \"Luigi's Mansion\" was later shown at E3 2001 with the GameCube console. Miyamoto made more \"Mario\" spinoffs in these years. He also produced the 3D game series \"Metroid Prime\". This was because the original designer Yokoi, a friend of Miyamoto's, died. In this time he developed \"Pikmin\" and its sequel \"Pikmin 2\". These games were based on his experiences gardening. He also worked on new games for the \"Star Fox\", \"Donkey Kong\", \"F-Zero\", and \"The Legend of Zelda\" series on the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance systems. With the help of Hideo Kojima, he helped the developers of \"\". He helped with many games on the Nintendo DS. The games included the remake of \"Super Mario 64\", \"Super Mario 64 DS\". It also included the new game \"Nintendogs\", a new franchise based on his own experiences with dogs.\n2011\u2013present: Wii U, 3DS, and Switch.\nMiyamoto produced \"Super Mario 3D Land\" and \"\" for the 3DS, and \"Pikmin 3\" for the Wii U.\nAfter Nintendo president Satoru Iwata died in July 2015, Miyamoto was chosen to be an acting Representative Director, along with Genyo Takeda. He was no longer in this position in September 2015 when Tatsumi Kimishima became the company's president. He was also chosen to be in the position of \"Creative Fellow\" at the same time. He would give expert advice to Kimishima as a \"support network\" alongside Takeda.\nMiyamoto was a creative director on the 2017 game \"Super Mario Odyssey\". He was not one of its producers. He is credited as being a big influence on the game's development.\nDevelopment philosophy.\nMiyamoto and Nintendo do not use focus groups. Instead, Miyamoto figures out if a game is fun by playing it himself. He says that if he enjoys it, others will too. He uses how the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series was created as an example. He said \"And that's the point \u2013 Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It's the most important feeling we should have when we make games.\"\nImpact.\n\"Time\" called Miyamoto \"the Spielberg of video games\" and \"the father of modern video games.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" says he is \"regarded by many as possibly the most important game designer of all time.\" \"GameTrailers\" called him \"the most influential game creator in history.\" Miyamoto has greatly influenced various things about video games in general. \"The Daily Telegraph\" credited him with creating \"some of the most innovative, ground breaking and successful work in his field.\" Many of Miyamoto's works have started new video game concepts or changed existing ones. Miyamoto's games have received outstanding critical praise. Some are considered to be the best games of all time.\nMiyamoto's games have also sold very well.

In 2006, Miyamoto was made a \"Chevalier\" (knight) of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres.\nOn November 28, 2006, Miyamoto was in \"TIME Asia\"'s \"60 Years of Asian Heroes,\" alongside Hayao Miyazaki, Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Bruce Lee and the Dalai Lama. He was later one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of the Year in both 2007 and also in 2008. At the Game Developers Choice Awards, on March 7, 2007, Miyamoto received the Lifetime Achievement Award. Both GameTrailers and IGN placed Miyamoto first on their lists for the \"Top Ten Game Creators\" and the \"Top 100 Game Creators of All Time\".\nHe was made a Fellow of BAFTA at the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 19, 2010. In 2012, Miyamoto was the first interactive creator to be awarded the highest recognition in the Spanish-speaking world, the Prince of Asturias Award.\nPersonal Life.\nMiyamoto has a wife, Yasuko, and two children. In 2010, his son was 25 and working at an advertising agency. His daughter was 23 and studying zoology at the time. His children played video games in their youth, but he also made them go outside. Although he knows some English, he is not fluent and would rather speak in Japanese for interviews.\nMiyamoto usually does not sign autographs. He is worried that if he signs an autograph for one person, many other people will ask for autographs too. He also does not appear on Japanese television because he likes privacy. More foreign tourists than Japanese people recognize him.\nMiyamoto does not spend much time playing video games in his personal time. He likes playing the guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He likes bluegrass music. He has a Shetland Sheepdog named Pikku. The dog was why Miyamoto wanted to create \"Nintendogs\". He is also a semi-professional dog breeder. He has been quoted as saying, \"Video games are bad for you? That's what they said about rock and roll.\"\nMiyamoto like to move the furniture in his house, even late at night. He also said that he has a hobby of guessing how long something is, then checking to see if he was correct. He carries a measuring tape with him everywhere. In December 2016, Miyamoto showed his hobby on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\". He also played the \"Super Mario Bros.\" theme on guitar with The Roots during the same show."}

The word \"truck\" comes from the Greek word \"trochos\", which means \"wheel\". Most trucks use diesel fuel.\nSizes of trucks.\nLight trucks.\n\"Light trucks\" are trucks the size of cars. They are used by individuals and also companies. In the United States, a truck is a light truck if it weighs less than 6,300 kg (13,000 lb). Light trucks are only a little heavier than vans or pickup trucks, but require a special driver's license.\nMedium trucks.\n\"Medium trucks\" are heavier than light trucks but lighter than heavy trucks. In the United States, a truck is a medium truck if it weighs between 6,300 kg (13,000 lb) and 15,000 kg (33,000 lb). Trucks that are used for local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks) are normally around this size. Medium trucks have usually two axles: one at front and one at rear. The rear wheels may be coupled (that is: two wheels hitched together) to enable heavier load, but they may also be single.\nHeavy trucks.\n\"Heavy trucks\" are the heaviest trucks that are allowed on the road. In the U.K. they are known as \"lorries\". Usually heavy trucks have three axles: one at front and two at rear, and the rear axles have coupled wheels to enable heavy loads. Often heavy trucks pull trailers. They can be either \"full trailers\" which have both front and rear axles or boggies and their own brakes, and are connected to the towing truck with a towbar, or \"semi-trailers\", which are attached to a special kind of a truck called \"tractor unit\" with a turntable coupling (\"fifth wheel\"). A semi-trailer is a kind of trailer which has wheels only in the back and the front rides on the back of the tractor unit. The tractor unit has an engine and the semi-trailer does not. Driving a heavy truck requires a professional driver's license. Truck drivers are called \"truckers\".\nThe laws of various countries say what kind of vehicle combinations are allowed. A semi-trailer can be converted into a full trailer with using a \"dolly\". A dolly is a small trailer which has only a bogie (= set of wheels), fifth wheel coupling for the semi-trailer and a towbar. Using a dolly, the semi-trailer can now be hitched to an ordinary cargo-carrying truck and does not need a tractor unit.\nA heavy truck-trailer combination is often called a big rig or eighteen-wheeler.\nThe largest heavy trucks are the Australian \"road trains\" which may have up to four semi-trailers coupled to a tractor in a train-like fashion and may carry up to 200 tonnes of cargo.\nBody types.\nBox trucks or Dry vans (\"tilts\" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making a closed cargo room. The rear has doors. Some have a side door.\nConcrete mixers have a turning drum on back. Turning it one way mixes the concrete. Turning it the other way pushes the concrete out. The concrete goes down \"chutes\" (like large pipes with an open top). On most trucks the concrete comes out the back. Some new types have the concrete goes over the cab and down chutes in the front. Concrete is very heavy and hard to mix. Concrete mixers have to be very heavy duty.\nDump trucks (\"tippers\" in the UK) carry sand, gravel, and dirt. Most dump trucks have an open-top box bed with an opening \"tail-gate\" door on the back. The body lifts up at the front. The load falls out the tailgate and is \"dumped\" on the ground behind the truck.\nFlatbed trucks have a flat body with no sides. There is a wall between the cab and the body. The load will not move forward and hit the cab. The truck can be loaded from the side or top. Nothing covers the load. Some trucks have sides that can be taken off or folded down. Many times the load is covered with tarps.\nGarbage trucks pick up garbage and trash from homes and some businesses. Most were loaded from the rear. Now some load from the front or side. The same type of truck is often used for recycling.\nSemi-tractors (\"artics\" in the UK) have no bodies. They have a \"fifth wheel\" that carries weight. A semi-trailer has no front wheels. The front of the trailer goes on the fifth wheel. The semi-tractor carries weight from the trailer and pulls the trailer\nTank trucks (\"tankers\" in the UK) are designed to carry liquids or gases. They usually have a round tank that is long (a cylinder) lying on its side. There are many types of tanks because there are many liquids and gases. Most tankers are built for only one liquid.\nWreckers (\"recovery lorries\" in the UK and sometimes \"tow trucks\" in the US) are used to lift and tow broken cars and trucks. They usually have a boom with a cable. Cars are often carried on special flatbeds."}

Usually, they have orange-red to purplish skin, with yellow or pink spikes on their skin. The crown-of-thorns is also one of the largest starfish in the world, as it has a diameter of up to 3 feet. The crown-of-thorns lives in the warmer areas of the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea.\nIt only feeds on coral polyps, and usually at night. The crown-of-thorns climbs over its prey, releases digestive enzymes to break down its food, and then absorbs the coral polyp, which has now turned into a liquid. What's left behind by the sea star is the leftover coral skeleton.\nThey are usually of subdued colours, pale brown to grey-green, but they may be garish with bright warning colours in some parts of their wide range. These bright colours warn animals that may want to eat it that it is venomous.\nEffect on coral reefs.\nThe crown-of-thorns is well known for its destructive habits of eating coral, especially on the Great Barrier Reef, which is a World Heritage Site. Usually, when there are not too many of them, these sea stars help maintain the coral reef by preventing the faster-growing coral from taking over the coral reef. However, when there are too many crown-of-thorns, they can devastate the reef."}

Like the rest of the Echinoderms, literally \"spike-skinned\", they are entirely marine. They are usually globe-shaped, and protected by calcareous plates and spines.p65 \"Urchin\" is an old word for hedgehog, and in many foreign languages these animals are called \"sea hedgehogs\".\nLike other echinoderms they have five-fold symmetry (called pentamerism) and move by means of hundreds of tiny, transparent, adhesive 'tube feet'. The symmetry is not obvious in the living animal, but is easily visible in the dried test.\nSea urchins mostly feed on algae and small animals. They have a special chewing apparatus called \"Aristotle's lantern\", after the Greek philosopher Aristotle who was fascinated by sea urchins. With this apparatus they can scrape organisms stuck to the surface over which the urchin is moving.\nSpines.\nThe spines are long and sharp in some species, and protect the urchin from predators. The spines inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin, but are usually not dangerous. Echinoids also have pincer-like pedicellaria all over their body between the spines. The job of these is to deal with anything (like larvae) settling on the test (outer shell).p101 It is not known if the spines are venomous (unlike the pedicellariae between the spines, which are venomous).\nTypical sea urchins have spines that are in length, thick, and not terribly sharp. \"Diadema antillarum\", familiar in the Caribbean, has thin, potentially dangerous spines that can reach long.\nTeeth.\nSea urchins have five jaws with one tooth each. The teeth grow throughout the sea urchin's life. The teeth of the pink sea urchin chip against each other to stay sharp.\nEcology.\nSea urchins feed mainly on algae, but can also feed on sea cucumbers, and a wide range of invertebrates such as mussels, polychaetes, sponges, brittle stars and crinoids. Sea urchins are one of the favorite foods of sea otters and wolf eels. Without predators to eat them, urchins breed in large numbers and eat almost all the nearby kelp, creating an \"urchin barren\", devoid of macroalgae and associated fauna. Sea otters have re-entered British Columbia, dramatically improving coastal ecosystem health by eating sea urchins.\nFossil record and evolution.\nThe first echinoid fossils are from the Lower Ordovician period. The earliest forms had flexible tests, with plates that could slide over each other. Echinoids were a relatively unimportant part of the biota in the Palaeozoic. Only one group survived the P/Tr extinction event to form the basis of all later echinoids. The group which survived into the Triassic, the Cidaroids, radiated into all other modern groups, which are known as the Euechinoids.\nThe break with perfect symmetry, which happened in the Jurassic, gave them definite front and back ends. This opened up new habitats, in particular, the burrowing habitat. Sand dollars and heart urchins have been highly successful. The living echinoids are now important members of the biota, especially in shallow and in-shore waters.\nSea urchins as food.\nSome humans eat the reproductive organs of sea urchins (which they call roe). This is popular in Korea. In Japan, this kind of sushi is called \"uni\"."}

The adults are superficially like starfish, but they are a different group, with different larvae. Like other echinoderms, they do have a skeleton of calcareous plates, and radial symmetry. There are about 1500 different species. \nUsually they have 5 \"arms\", which can grow long, up to 60\u00a0cm, in the largest species. The central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter. Unlike starfish, they live deeper in the ocean. Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (&gt;6000 m) depths. However, brittle stars are also common members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. Generally, brittle stars live below 500m of depth. \nThere are two related groups of Ophiuroids: the \"Ophiurida\" (brittle stars) and the basket stars (\"Eurialida\"). Basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range. Brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores, able to catch some small prey on occasion.\nDescription.\nMany brittle stars are more fragile than starfish, which is how they got their name. When they are picked up, their arms may fall off. This might make the animal seem brittle, but they often do this as a defense to escape from predators. \nMovement.\nBrittle stars do not use their tube feet for movement, but instead use muscles in their long, thin arms to go around rocks. Ophiurids move quickly when disturbed, and are faster movers than starfish. In living ophiuroids the plates are linked by longitudinal muscles. Ophiurid arms only move horizontally. The way their plates interlock prevents the arms from moving in any other plane.p64 In contrast, basket star arms can move vertically. These movement patterns are distinct, and separate the groups.\nOphiuroids in general are mostly scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents.\nBasket stars.\nBasket stars (Euryalids) are large brittle stars with many rays. Their arms branch, and can be moved in any direction. This distinguishes them from the Ophiurids. Basket stars may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. The arms form so many branches that they are almost feathery on the ends. They get their name because when they stretch their rays out to catch plankton, they look like the bottom of a basket.\nBasket stars can be large and heavy, the biggest Ophiuroids. The largest, \"Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni\", weigh up to 5\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lbs) and has arms 70cms long, with a disk diameter of 14\u00a0cm."}

The soft parts are inside the shell. The shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical.\nThere are over 30,000 species of bivalves, including the fossil species. There are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 genera and 106 families. All of them live in the water, most of them in the sea or in brackish water. Some live in fresh water. All are filter feeders: they lost their radula in the course of evolution. A few are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae eaten by other bivalves.\nThe best known examples of bivalves are clams, mussels, scallops and oysters.\nShell.\nBivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge with hinge teeth. They are made of a calcareous mineral, calcite or aragonite. The valves are covered by a periostracum, which is an organic horny substance. This forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell.\nThe shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles. Scallops can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim.\nFood.\nA bivalve takes in water that has plankton and other things floating in it.\nSome (but not all) molluscs have a part of their mantle known as the siphon (a tube). Siphons, if they exist, come in pairs, one to suck in, one to expel.\nAnything that is small enough to fit inside the hole of its incurrent siphon enters the bivalve. When the floating material comes in, it gets stuck in slimy mucus that is on the surface of the bivalve's gills. The food is moved down to the mouth, which is on the other side of the siphon. Food is digested in the bivalve's stomach and intestine, and everything that is not digested goes out through the other siphon, with water.\nThe siphons are an adaptation of burrowing molluscs. Those that live above the substrate (sediment), such as scallops and oysters, do not need them.\nFeeding types.\nThere are four feeding types, defined by their gill structure: \nMovement.\nDigging.\nAs a group, the bivalves are adapted to penetrate into, and to move along horizontally along, soft ground such as mud and sand. Common examples of this are razor shells, which can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape enemies, and cockles.\nSwimming.\nScallops and file clams can swim to escape a predator, clapping their valves together to create a jet of water. Cockles can use their foot to leap from danger. However these methods quickly exhaust the animal. In the razor shells the siphons can break off only to grow back later.\nDefensive secretions.\nThe file shells can produce a noxious secretion when threatened, and the fan shells of the same family have a unique, acid-producing organ.\nComparison with brachiopods.\nBivalves are superficially similar to brachiopods, but the construction of the shell is completely different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, they are on the left and right sides.\nBivalves appeared late in the Cambrian explosion and came to increase in the Palaeozoic, and dominate over brachiopods during the Mesozoic. So, it was thought that bivalves are better adapted to aquatic life than the brachiopods, and this caused brachiopods to be out-competed and relegated to minor niches.\nHowever, after the Permian-Triassic extinction event bivalves had a huge adaptive radiation while brachiopods were devastated, losing 95% of their diversity.\nThe upshot was that bivalves took over the desirable inshore habitats. Brachiopods now live in deeper waters where food is scarcer."}

The Presbyterianism is an example. The leader of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator. The General Assembly elects the Moderator of the Church of Scotland each year. Other Christian movements have neither bishops nor priests: Quakers are one example.\nIn the Catholic church, the Pope is chosen by all the cardinals from amongst their number. According to church law, this does not have to be the case: any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was Urban VI (elected in 1378).\nThe pope is also 'the Bishop of Rome'. In fact he rules an independent state within Rome, called the Vatican.

This helps food go down the throat to the stomach.\nThere are three main pairs of salivary glands. They are\nThere are also many small glands in the tongue, cheeks, lips and palate. All of those glands make mucous.\nSalivary secretions and structure.\nSaliva consists of two fluids, mucous and serous.\nMucous.\nMucous (slime) is a saccharide glycoprotein called mucin. With water it makes the slippery lubricant used in many parts of the body, where it lines the moving parts, surfaces and tubes. Here it lubricates the mouth, throat and alimentary canal. \nThe mucous also has antiseptic qualities: it contains lysozyme and immunoglobulins. Mucous, with its antiseptic molecules and slime, traps fungi, bacteria and viruses and prevents infections. The body produces about a litre of mucous per day, in the mouth and other places.\nSerous Fluid.\nThe serous fluid contains the enzyme amylase which acts in the digestion of carbohydrates. Minor salivary glands on the tongue secrete the amylase. The parotid gland produces purely serous saliva. The other major salivary glands produce mixed (serous and mucus) saliva.\nAnother type of serous fluid is secreted by the two layered serous membranes which line the body cavities. The serous fluid between the two layers acts as a lubricant and reduces friction from muscle movement. \nStructure of salivary glands.\nThe glands are inside a capsule, of connective tissue. Inside, it is made of little parts called lobules. Blood vessels and nerves go into the lobules. There are three main types of cells in the major salivary glands:\nThe small tubes go into ducts. Those ducts go into larger ducts that have little stripes on them, called striations. Those go into ducts between the lobes of the gland (called interlobar or excretory ducts). The main duct of the salivary glands then opens into the mouth.\nWhere the glands are.\nThere are three salivary glands:\nMedical notes.\nDucts can get blocked. This would cause pain and swelling of the gland.\nTumours of the salivary glands can occur. These are usually benign. Investigation is done by a sialogram, which is a radiocontrast study of a salivary duct."}

They connect the left and right epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in order to move sperm. Each tube is about 30 centimeters long. During ejaculation the smooth muscle in the wall of the vas deferens contracts. That pushes the sperm toward the penis. The sperm go from the vas deferens into the urethra. Other male sex glands push out at the same time.\nVasectomy.\nThere is a surgery called vasectomy that is a method of contraception. The two vasa deferentia (Latin plural) are cut and sealed, so the sperm cannot get out of the body. This is usually permanent, but in some cases it can be reversed. Sometimes instead of cutting the vas deferentia, the surgeon puts something to block the sperm instead of cutting them."}

One is called felsic magma. Felsic magma is thick and has silica minerals. It mostly makes light-coloured rocks. Another type is called mafic magma, which is runny and has less silica. It usually makes dark-coloured rocks. Magmas can be intermediate between both types. \nMagma may become solid by cooling slowly below the surface. This makes \"plutonic\" rocks such as granite. When magma comes out from the ground in a volcano it is called lava. Lava cools quickly, and forms other kinds of rock such as basalt. \nMagma is produced by melting of the Earth's mantle or the crust. It happens at tectonic settings, such as subduction zones, continental rift zones, mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. \nMelted material from the mantle and crust moves up through the crust and collects in magma chambers. \nWhen they come up through the crust, magmas may feed a volcano and come out as lava. But they may solidify underground to form an intrusion. Intrusions eventually cool down and become igneous dikes or sills. \nThe study of magma is usually done in lava flows. However, magma was found under the ground three times in geothermal drilling projects\u2014twice in Iceland and once in Hawaii."}

Later, people learned to make glue by boiling animal feet, cartilage or bones. Some very strong glues were first made from fish bones, rubber or milk.\nA simple glue can be made at home by mixing wheat, flour and water. This glue will stick pieces of paper together.\nMany kinds of art can be made using glue. A collage is a work of art made by using glue to stick coloured things onto paper. \nSome glues can be used to keep water out of boats, buildings or vehicles. In this case, the glue may be called caulk. Some man-made materials, including wood-like materials, are made using glues to bind together small pieces of material or powders. \nWhile many glues are safe, certain kinds of glue contain strong-smelling chemicals. Some people sniff these glues to get high. Sometimes people breathe in the vapors by mistake. This is a very bad idea because these chemicals are often poisons and may cause brain damage or illness. \nGlue can also be made from rice or rice flour. "}

It is a little shorter than the Mississippi River, but with 1.5 times the flow. It comes from Mongolia and follows a northern course to the Kara Sea. The river drains a large part of central Siberia. The longest stream following the Yenisei-Angara-Selenga-Ider is about 5539 km long. Its watershed, which includes the world's largest (by volume) lake, Lake Baikal, holds more water than any other river system.\nThe upper parts of the system have rapids and flooding, and pass through areas where very few people live. The middle section is controlled by a series of large hydroelectric dams. The dams were built to supply a major Russian primary industry. Partly built by gulag labor in Soviet times, industrial contamination is a big problem in the area. The area is very hard for the police to watch. Moving on through sparsely populated taiga, the Yenisei grows with many tributaries and finally reaches the Kara Sea in desolate tundra where it is covered with ice for more than half the year. As with other Siberian rivers, the flow has increased lately. People think this is because of global warming. A concern was also raised that a change in the salt in the Arctic may have a global impact on ocean currents."}

In the Southern Ocean, one species, the Antarctic krill, \"Euphausia superba\", makes up an estimated biomass of over , roughly twice that of the human race.

Of this, over half is eaten by each year, and is replaced by growth and reproduction. \nMost krill species make large vertical migrations. They are distinguished from other crustaceans such as true shrimp by their externally visible gills.\nTaxonomy.\nThe order Euphausiacea is divided into two families, Bentheuphausiidae and Euphausiidae. the first has one species, the second has 85 species.

Krill probably get this substance as part of their diet, which contains dinoflagellates. Krill photophores are complex organs with lenses and focusing abilities, and can be rotated by muscles.

Giraffes have an even number of toes and are the tallest land animals. Giraffes and Okapi are the family \"Giraffidae,\" and are the only extant giraffids. \nAppearance.\nGiraffes have a very long neck and long legs. Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with necks that can be up to 2-2.4\u00a0m (6.6-7.9\u00a0ft) in length. Fully grown giraffes stand tall, with males taller than females. The tallest recorded male was and the tallest recorded female was tall. The average weight is for an adult male and for an adult female. Maximum weights of and having been recorded for males and females, respectively. They have a long black tongue, up to 45\u00a0cm in length. This they use to wrap around leaves and pull them off trees.\nTheir fur has a light yellowish tan or off-white colour with brown or russet patches. No two giraffes have the same pattern. The different sub-species have different coat patterns. Both male and female giraffes have small horn-like stumps on their head, which are covered with skin. The horns are called ossicones. These come from the cartilage displaced from their skull as it develops. These are fur-covered bumps on their skulls, unlike the horns of other animals.\nHabitat.\nGiraffes are found in parts of Africa. They live on the savannah, which is the African grassland, or in light woodland. They do not live in thick forests where it is difficult to see predators (such as lions) approaching.The temperature is normally around 70 degrees. Most giraffes live either in East Africa or in Angola and Zambia in southwestern Africa.\nLife.\nGiraffes eat mostly leaves from tall trees, which they can reach because of their long legs and long necks, as well as fruit. Their rough tongue allows them to eat the acacia leaves protected by thorns. They can go without water for weeks. Like all mammals, giraffes have only seven bones in their necks.\nGiraffes live alone or in loose groups. Young male giraffes foa single baby, which is called \"calf\". Giraffes give birth while standing, so the baby falls down 2 metres. Giraffe calfs are already 2 m tall and weigh 50-55 kg. The calf stays with its mother for 1\u00bd years. Young giraffes become mature when they are 4 years old, and they are fully grown when they are 6 years old. Giraffes can live to 25 years old, and in captivity they can live 35 years.\nGiraffes use their feet to kick predators away, and mature male giraffes use their head and necks to fight for dominance at mating time.

The females, who receive little to no aid from their partners in raising the calves, prefer the males that are victorious. Those with the longer and stronger necks will reproduce more frequently and keep their genes in the giraffe population for longer compared to the males with shorter, weaker necks. \nThere are about nine different subspecies of giraffe, with only small differences between them. When giraffes of two different sub-species breed, the young are called hybrids (mixed breeds). Of the nine sub-species of giraffe, only one, the Rothchild's, is endangered."}

Carpets are warmer and softer than hard floors such as hardwood, tile, or concrete. Carpets may be many different sizes. Rugs and carpets originated in Central Asia, but the idea of machine manufacture was invented in Europe. The oldest known carpet was found in the year of 1947 at excavations in Siberia. So there are two different kinds of things: one is hand-made by traditional methods, and the other woven by machine. This accounts for the very great difference in style and price between traditional rugs and modern wall-to-wall carpeting.\nThe name \"carpet\" comes from Old Italian carpita, \"carpire\" means to pluck. The term \"carpet\" is used mostly to describe textiles placed on the floor most of the times stretched from wall to wall.\nRugs are smaller in size, often placed over a carpet, and often decorated. In Islam, rugs are used as prayer mats, for people to kneel on when they pray.\nIt is common, especially in the Middle East, for rugs and carpets to be used as wall decoration, and they are designed with decoration in mind. Mass-manufactured carpets in western countries are utilitarian: for hard use on the floor, and usually self-coloured (that is one color over the whole carpet). Traditional rugs from the Middle East are hand-made and may be very expensive by the time they reach shops in the western world.\nIn some countries carpets are designed in a way to tell stories. They can tell history of family or something important that happened."}

It is stored in the bladder and comes out of the human body through the urethra, a tube which leads from the bladder to the urethral meatus (\"meatus\" is an opening in the body), at the tip of the penis (men) or the vulva (women). Urinating is how the body gets rid of unwanted or unneeded substances in the blood. Urine is the liquid that these substances are put in. After the blood has circulated through the body, its composition has changed, because some substances in the blood have been absorbed by the body, and because the body has released other substances into the blood. The blood has also absorbed substances produced from our food. The liver removes many toxins (harmful substances) and adds other substances that the blood needs (amino acids, proteins, coagulation factors, hormones, etc.). Then the kidneys remove excess amounts of urea, salts, etc. by putting them into the urine. After the blood has passed through the liver and the kidneys, it has the correct composition that the body needs.\nUrine is mostly water, and contains mineral salts, and about 2% urea, which is produced in the liver to remove ammonia, which is a very toxic substance. Urea has a very low toxicity, although a continuous high level of urea in the blood (a condition called hyperuremia) can cause disease.\nThe color of urine normally ranges from colourless to yellow. The yellow color is caused by urobilins, which are produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin, the substance that gives blood its red color. If a person is dehydrated, less urine will be produced (maybe less than one liter per day), and it will be more concentrated. If a person drinks a lot of water, more urine will be produced (maybe as much as two liters per day) and it will be less concentrated.\nUrine lets the body get rid of:\nSome slang terms for urine are \"pee\" and \"piss\"."}

Auschwitz III (Monowitz) and the subcamps were forced labor camps where prisoners worked as slaves. These camps were established because there were too many Polish prisoners and not enough room in \"local\" prisons to hold them in.\nThe Auschwitz camps were in a town in Poland called O\u015bwi\u0119cim. (\"Auschwitz\" is the German name for \"O\u015bwi\u0119cim.\") In German, Auschwitz was called Konzentrationslager Auschwitz (KZ Auschwitz), which means \"Auschwitz concentration camp.\"\nThe \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), led by Heinrich Himmler, ran the death camps and concentration camps in Nazi Germany.\nNo one knows exactly how many people were sent to Auschwitz, or how many died there. However, historians estimate that between 1940 and 1945, the Nazis sent at least 1.3 million people to Auschwitz. About 1.1 million of these people died or were killed at Auschwitz.\nBackground.\nExtermination camps were different from concentration camps. Starting in 1940, the Nazis built about 150 concentration camps and many more sub-camps. However, there were only six extermination camps in Nazi Germany, all in eastern Europe:\nIn extermination camps, almost everyone was killed right after they got to the camps. The Nazis killed about 3.0-3.5 million people in these death camps. 90% of them were Jewish people. \nSelection.\nEvery day, Nazi authorities brought many prisoners to Auschwitz on trains. The camp's SS doctors separated these prisoners into three groups. This was called \"selection.\" Selection was how the SS decided which of Auschwitz's camps each prisoner would go to.\nDeath.\nMost prisoners sent to Auschwitz were selected for death. This means the SS decided they should be killed right away. Usually, the SS put all children, most women, all elderly people, people who looked sick, and people who looked like they could not work in this group. SS guards brought these people right to Auschwitz's gas chambers and killed them with poison gas. They used a form of hydrogen cyanide, a type of poison gas called a blood agent. They called this poison gas Zyklon B. This gas was a very efficient way of killing the prisoners, and could kill everyone exposed to it within 20 minutes. \nPrimo Levi, a prisoner who survived Auschwitz, later wrote about what selections were like:\n\"In less than ten minutes all the fit [healthy] men had been collected together in a group. [I]n [the SS guards'] rapid and summary choice each one of us had been judged capable or not of working usefully for the [Third] Reich... [W]e know that of our [group] no more than ninety-six men and twenty-nine women entered the [camps], and that of all the others, more than five hundred in number, not one was living two days later\u2026\"\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Thus in an instant, our women, our parents, our children disappeared. We saw them for a short while as an obscure mass at the other end of the platform; then we saw nothing more.\"\nForced labor.\nThe SS selected some strong, healthy people to be slave workers. They worked at Auschwitz I; at an IG Farben factory at Auschwitz III; and at munitions factories in the sub-camps. Records say that between 1940 and 1945, about 405,000 people worked as slave laborers, and about 84% of them (340,000) died.\nOskar Schindler, a German business owner, saved about 1,000 Jews from Poland. He sent them away to his factory, and these Jews lived.\nSpecial jobs.\nSS officials chose a third group of people they could use for special jobs or medical experiments. For example:\nKapos and \"Sonderkommandos\" made it possible for a small number of SS guards to control tens of thousands of prisoners at Auschwitz. Altogether, about 7,000 SS members worked at Auschwitz.p.\u00a040\nThe camps.\nAuschwitz I.\nAuschwitz I was the office for all of the camps in the Auschwitz complex.\nThe Nazis kept prisoners at Auschwitz from 14 June 1940 until 27 January 1945.p.\u00a0128\nPrisoners.\nThe first prisoners at Auschwitz I were 728 people from Poland. One of these prisoners was Kazimierz Albin. He survived Auschwitz. Later, he wrote about how the first day at Auschwitz began:\n\"[W]e had to line up in five rows... [SS guard] Frizsch announced: \"This is Auschwitz Concentration Camp... Any resistance or disobedience will be ruthlessly punished. Anyone disobeying superiors, or trying to escape, will be sentenced to death. Young and healthy people don't live longer than three months here. Priests one month, Jews two weeks. There is only one way out\u2014through the crematorium chimneys.\"\"\nNext were 48 homosexual men from Germany. Then Jews arrived as prisoners.\nFrom 1940-1941, at any time, there were between 13,000 and 16,000 prisoners in Auschwitz I. By 1942, there were 20,000. Most of these prisoners were not Jewish, because most of the Jewish prisoners were sent to Auschwitz II.\nAt Auschwitz, the prisoners had to put marks on their uniforms to show why they were sent to Auschwitz. For example, Jewish prisoners had to sew two yellow triangles onto their clothes, in the shape of a Star of David. Homosexual people had to sew a pink triangle onto their clothes. The SS also gave each prisoner a serial number and tattooed the number on the prisoners' bodies. The SS never called prisoners by their names, only by their numbers.\nThe living conditions at Auschwitz I were very bad. Prisoners got very little food. There was no sanitation, which made it easy for diseases to spread. Many prisoners died from diseases, starvation, and freezing to death.\nOn Sundays, the prisoners had to clean their barracks, and were allowed to shower.\nPunishments and torture.\nThe SS built many types of rooms meant to punish and torture prisoners. These included:\nSometimes, the SS would tie a prisoner's hands behind his back and hang him by his wrists. This would break the person's shoulder joints. The SS would leave prisoners hanging like this for hours or days, sometimes until the prisoners died.\nThe SS also hung some prisoners by the neck, so they would die a slow and painful death.\nGas chambers.\nThe SS tried killing prisoners with Zyklon B for the first time at Auschwitz I, on 3rd September 1941.\nIn their first test, the SS used Zyklon B on 600 prisoners of war from the Soviet Union and about 250 Polish people.p.\u00a088 When the gas killed these prisoners, the SS realized that they could kill people much more quickly with Zyklon B than they could by shooting them. They built a gas chamber, where they could kill over 700 people at a time.p.\u00a0160 They also built a crematorium in block 11 of the camp.p.\u00a0160\nFrom 1941 to 1942, the SS killed about 60,000 people in this gas chamber. After 1942, they made the gas chamber an air-raid shelter for the SS to hide in if Allied planes were dropping bombs nearby.pp.\u00a0123\u2013124\nToday, the gas chamber still exists. It has been re-built, using its original parts. Now, it is a part of the museum at Auschwitz.\nWomen prisoners.\nOn 26th March 1942, the SS sent the first women prisoners to Auschwitz.\nFrom about March 1941 to January 1945, Nazi Dr. Carl Clauberg did medical experiments on many women at Auschwitz. He wanted to find a way to sterilize millions of people as easily and quickly as possible. He tried using X-rays, surgery, and medications to sterilize women prisoners. The Nazis' plan was to get rid of everyone who was not \"Aryan.\" As part of this plan, the Nazis sterilized many people so they could not have children who were not \"Aryan.\"p.\u00a073\nIn 1943, Heinrich Himmler ordered the SS to create a brothel in Auschwitz. Non-Jewish women prisoners were forced to work in the brothel. Prisoners who were important to the Nazis, like kapos and chefs, were allowed to use the brothel as a reward. Heinrich Himmler also ordered homosexual prisoners to visit the brothel every week. He thought this would 'cure' them of being homosexual.\nJohanna Langefeld, Maria Mandel, and Elisabeth Volkenrath were in charge of the women prisoners at Auschwitz.\nDr. Mengele.\nCriminal Joseph Mengele did medical experiments on many prisoners, especially twins, dwarves, and people with physical disabilities. All of these experiments were very crude and painful. For example, Mengele castrated some prisoners without using any anesthetics. Many women and men died during these experiments.\nMengele was also in charge of Auschwitz's camp \"hospital.\" This was not like a regular hospital. Prisoners who were doctors, like Gisella Perl, worked there. They tried to help prisoners who were sick or hurt, but they had no medications or medical supplies, not even clean bandages or running water. If patients did not get better quickly, Mengele sent them to the gas chambers, or Nazi doctors killed them by injecting them with phenol.\nAuschwitz II (Birkenau).\nAuschwitz II was Auschwitz's death camp. It was also called Birkenau (pronounced \"BEER-kin-now\"), which means \"the birch wood\" (forest). Today, Birkenau is often just called \"Auschwitz.\"\nThe Nazis began building Auschwitz II in October 1941, because Auschwitz I was getting too crowded. By this time, Adolf Hitler had decided to kill all of the Jewish people. The Nazis called this plan the \"Final Solution.\" Soon after it was built, Heinrich Himmler ordered Auschwitz II to be used as a killing center. Its goal would be to kill every prisoner that was sent there.\nAuschwitz II had four gas chambers. The Nazis made the gas chambers look like showers. They convinced prisoners that they were going into the gas chambers to shower.p.\u00a0160 Then they dropped Zyklon B into the gas chambers and killed everyone inside. The dead bodies were burned to ashes in Auschwitz II's four crematoria.p.\u00a0160\nAuschwitz II was the largest death camp run by Nazi Germany during The Holocaust. The SS killed more people at Auschwitz than in any of the other Nazi death camps. The SS built Auschwitz II's gas chambers so that 2,000 people could fit inside at once. This meant they were able to kill about 2,000 people every 30\u00a0minutes in the gas chambers.\nAuschwitz III (Monowitz).\nAuschwitz III was also called Monowitz (pronounced \"MOW-no-vitz\"). At Monowitz and the 48 subcamps around it, prisoners worked as slaves in the IG Farben factory and factories that made weapons for the German Army.p.\u00a053\nThe IG Farben factory at Monowitz opened in 1941. By October 1942, prisoners had been forced to build the Monowitz camp, so slave workers could live there. IG Farben paid for the camp to be built. This made Monowitz the first concentration camp in history to be paid for and built by a private company.p.\u00a053\nBetween 1941 and 1945, about 35,000 prisoners worked at the IG Farben factory. Seven out of every ten of these prisoners (about 25,000) died from starvation, disease, and being forced to work so hard.pp.\u00a051, 53, 55 The average prisoner lived for only three months after being sent to Monowitz.p.\u00a056\nManagers at the IG Farben factory were always trying to make the prisoners work harder. Often they threatened prisoners by saying they would be sent to the gas chambers if they did not work harder.p.\u00a056 Every month, 20% of the slave workers at the factory (one out of every five) died or were sent to the gas chambers.\nCommanders.\nUntil the summer of 1943, Rudolf H\u00f6ss was the commander of Auschwitz.p.\u00a0193 After him, Arthur Liebehenschel and Richard Baer became commanders of the camp.\nAfter World War II, H\u00f6ss wrote an autobiography. He gave many details about Auschwitz's camps. At the Nuremberg Trials, he received the death penalty. He was hanged in front of the crematorium at Auschwitz I.\nResistance.\nBy 1943, many resistance groups had formed inside Auschwitz's camps. These were groups who tried to fight back against the Nazis, any way they could.\nResistance groups helped some prisoners to escape from Auschwitz. These people brought information to the world about the killings happening at Auschwitz.\nHowever, if one prisoner escaped, the SS killed many other prisoners. Sometimes, they brought the escaped prisoners' family members to Auschwitz. The SS did these things so that other prisoners would not try to escape. Overall, about 700 prisoners tried to escape from Auschwitz's three different camps. Of these 700, about 300 were able to escape.\nSome of the \"Sonderkommando\" at Auschwitz fought back against the SS. For example, in 1944, some of the \"Sonderkommando\" at Auschwitz blew up one of the camp's crematoria.\nAlso in 1944, members of the \"Sonderkommando\" secretly took pictures inside Auschwitz. These are the only pictures that show the mass murder that was happening at Auschwitz. Members of the Polish resistance helped sneak the photographs out of the camp.\nThe information.\nThe Allies got some information about Auschwitz's camps between 1941 and 1944. However, they did not believe that so many people were being killed at Auschwitz. Then two people, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, escaped from Auschwitz. They wrote reports about what was happening at Auschwitz. From these reports, Allied leaders learned the truth about Auschwitz in the middle of 1944.\nDuring 1944, Allied airplanes had taken some photographs of the area, including Auschwitz. However, no one studied these photographs. The first time anyone looked at these photos carefully was in the 1970s.\nAt one time, the Allies had planned to bomb the camps. However, they decided not to, because they did not want to kill any prisoners. In fact, some planes dropped bombs at nearby military targets. One bomb fell on the camp. It killed 315 prisoners and hurt 1425 more.\nPeople still argue about what the Allies could have done to save more of the prisoners at Auschwitz.\nFreedom.\nBy late 1944, the Red Army was close to Auschwitz. The SS blew up the gas chambers at Birkenau to hide what they had done. They also destroyed many other buildings and records.pp.\u00a0125\u2013127 On 17th January 1945, the camps' SS guards started to leave Auschwitz. They forced more than 58,000 prisoners to march west to the cities Gliwice or Wodzilaw. At the arrival of these cities they were transported by trains to concentration camps in Germany. They left behind only those who could not march. About 38,000 prisoners died on the forced march.pp.\u00a0125\u2013127\nOn 27th January 1945, the soldiers in the Red Army's 322nd Infantry reached Auschwitz. They found and freed about 7,500 prisoners.p.\u00a0128\nDeaths.\nNobody knows exactly how many people died at Auschwitz, or other Nazi camps. The SS kept records, but they destroyed most of them.\nHistorians have used many different ways of estimating how many people died at Auschwitz. For example, they have studied what witnesses at the Nuremberg Trials said. Some people who survived Auschwitz also helped to estimate how many people died there.\nStill, many different people and governments have disagreed about this:\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum says that these are \"the best estimates of the number of victims\" at Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945:\nAfter the war.\nMuseum.\nA few years after World War II ended, the government of Poland decided to rebuild Auschwitz and put a museum there. They repaired some of the camps. Sometimes they made very small changes from the original setup.\nThe museum has many parts and exhibits. They include:\nIn 1947, the museum was opened for the public. Later, people scattered the ashes of Auschwitz's victims between the huts where the prisoners lived. They see the entire area as a gravesite.\nOther honors.\nIn 1979, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Association (UNESCO) made Auschwitz a World Heritage Site.\nAlso in 1979, Polish Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass at Auschwitz II.\nIn the 1980s, Pope John Paul II made two people who were killed at Auschwitz into Catholic saints:\nIn 2005, the United Nations made 27 January the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. They chose 27 January because it is the day that the Red Army freed Auschwitz.\nOn 27 January 2005, the European Parliament marked the anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation with a minute of silence. The European Parliament also passed a resolution saying that the murder of about 1.5 million people at Auschwitz's camps was terrible. The Parliament said they passed the resolution partly because of \u201cthe disturbing rise in antisemitism, and especially antisemitic incidents, in Europe, and for learning anew the wider lessons about the dangers of victimizing people on the basis of race, ethnic origin, religion, social classification, politics or sexual orientation.\"\nControversies.\nAfter World War II, the communist governments of the Soviet Union and Poland put up a memorial sign at Auschwitz. The sign said 4 million people died at Auschwitz. After the fall of the communist government in Poland in 1989, the sign was changed to say that 1.1 million people died there. People who try to deny the Holocaust use this difference to claim that the Holocaust was propaganda. However, the Holocaust is a fact of history, and the SS killed at least 1.1 million people at Auschwitz.\nStarting in 1989, the Polish government and media argued that it was not fair to use the name \"Polish death camps\" to describe the Auschwitz camps. They said this name made it seem like Poland ran the death camps. In fact, Nazi Germany had taken over Poland, and the Nazis ran the death camps.p.\u00a073 In 2006, the Polish government asked UNESCO to change the name of the World Heritage Site at Auschwitz. They wanted UNESCO to change the name from \"Auschwitz Concentration Camp\" to \"Former Nazi German Concentration Camp Auschwitz-Birkenau\". The Polish government thought this would avoid misleading the public and would show that Nazi Germany ran the camp, not Poland. In 2007, UNESCO agreed, and changed the site's name to \"Auschwitz Birkenau: German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940-1945).\"\nThe Polish government had allowed filming at the sites for two movies, and a TV series. However, in some cases, they did not allow filming inside the camps. In February 2006, Poland refused visas to some researchers from Iran who wanted to visit Auschwitz. They did this because the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has denied the Holocaust, and even said that it is \"a myth.\"\nReligious controversies.\nIn 1984, the Carmelites opened a convent near Auschwitz I. Jewish groups protested, and the Carmelites removed the convent in 1993.\nIn 1987, after Pope John Paul II beatified Edith Stein, Catholic people put up a cross near the gas chamber. After some time, a Star of David appeared at the site. Many religious symbols appeared. Finally, people removed all of them.\nIn 1988, the Carmelites put up an 8-meter (26-foot) tall cross outside block 11 at Auschwitz. Jewish groups protested, saying that most of the people killed at Auschwitz were Jewish. By 1998, 300 smaller crosses had appeared. Finally, people removed the smaller crosses. However, the larger cross is still there."}

It is found the mountains and hills of southeast Australia, Tasmania, and Flinders Island in Bass Strait. They look like a small bear, which is what the name \"ursinus\" means. It is a marsupial, a type of mammal that carried its young in a pouch. It is the largest burrowing plant-eating mammal in the world. Its closest living relative is the koala.\nDescription.\nThey are a short and muscular animal that walks on four strong legs. The feet and claws are designed to help the wombat dig tunnels in rocky ground. They are between 70\u2013120 cm in length and weigh between 15\u201335 kg. It is covered in a very rough and coarse fur which can be anywhere from black to silver grey, from dark brown to sandy brown. Wombats have very tough skin on their rump.\nBreeding.\nWombats live alone but meet up to breed in April to June on mainland Australia. In Tasmania the breeding can occur at any time of the year. The young wombats are tiny, about two cm long, when they are born after a gestation of only 21 days, and move into the mother's pouch. Wombats normally only have one baby although the pouch has two nipples. Unlike a kangaroo, the pouch opens backwards, which would prevent it from filling with dirt as it crawls into its burrow. The young wombat lives in the pouch for about six months, and finally becomes independent of the mother at about 18 months of age. Wombats live for about five years, although some in captivity have lived for 26 years.\nDiet.\nWombats live in burrows that they dig with their sharp claws. They are nocturnal animals, and come out their burrows in the evening to look for food. It is a herbivore, so it only eats grass, tree and shrub roots, bark, leaves, and fungi. Wombat faeces are cube shaped. The wombat will use them to mark things in its territory, so it is common to find the cubes on top of leaves, rocks, and branches. Because of their shape they do not roll off.\nBurrows.\nThe burrows can be as small as two metres or as long as 30 metres. They dig with their front feet, kick the soil backwards with their back feet, and then use their rump like a bulldozer to push the dirt out of the burrow. Only one wombat lives in each burrow, but wombats may have up to four burrows in the area they live.\nLiving with wombats.\nFarmers see the Common Wombat as a pest. It often destroys fences by burrowing, and the burrow openings are a danger to grazing animals. It is still common in Australia, but the areas it lives in are being reduced because of land clearing for farms.\nThe common wombat has no natural predators. It is not scared of people and is often seen in camping areas. They can make good pets."}

{"id": "33334", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33334", "title": "Chimpanzee", "text": "The common chimpanzee (\"Pan troglodytes\"), or robust chimpanzee, is a species of great ape. The common chimpanzee is often called the chimpanzee (or \"chimp\"), though this can be used to refer to both species in the genus \"Pan\": the common chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing show both species of chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to modern humans.\nThe common chimpanzee is more robust than the bonobo, weighing between and measuring approximately from head to tail. Its gestation period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several more years; it reaches puberty at the age of eight to 10, and its lifespan in captivity is about 50 years.\nThe common chimpanzee lives in groups which range from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a male-dominated, strict hierarchy, so disputes can generally be settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them for acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts, and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear Senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees.\nThe common chimpanzee is listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range in the forests and savannahs of West and Central Africa. The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease.\nChimps eating habits.\nJane Goodall discovered that chimps hunt and eat smaller primates such as \"Colobus\" monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as \"one-third of the colobus population\" in the park each year. This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimp diet and behavior.\nAggression within the troop.\nAlso startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence \"within\" chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop in order to maintain their dominance, sometimes going as far as cannibalism.\nShe says of this revelation, \"During the first ten years of the study I had believed [\u2026] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [\u2026] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal\u2014that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature\". These findings revolutionized our knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour. They were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.\nAggression between groups.\nIf they can, male chimpanzees try to kill the male members of neighbouring groups. Males work together when they spot a chance to make a lightning raid on an isolated male from the other group. They kill him. In Gombe, Tanzania, a group in the 1970s was seen to kill seven of their neighbours one by one, until all were gone. It can take years for this to happen but, when it does, the remaining females and the neighbouring territory are added to the now larger group. Attacks like this are carefully planned, done only when success is likely, and carried out in silence. Their behaviour is quite different from any other behaviour known in chimpanzees:\nThe advantage for the males that triumph is to breed more children. Their tribe also holds a larger territory, and so has access to more food. Several authors have drawn a connection between this behaviour and the origins of human warfare."}

Although the name \"chimpanzee\" is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood to mean the common chimpanzee, while \"Pan paniscus\" is usually referred to as the bonobo.\nThe bonobo lives in rain forest, in a area south of the Congo River. This is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central Africa.\nThe bonobo has high levels of sexual behavior. Sex functions in conflict appeasement, affection, social status, excitement, and stress reduction. It occurs in virtually all partner combinations and in a variety of positions. This may explain the lower levels of aggression in the bonobo as compared to the common chimpanzee and other apes. Bonobos are matriarchal and a male's rank in the social hierarchy is often determined by his mother's rank.\nThe two chimpanzee species are separated by the huge Congo River. Its formation 1.5\u20132 million years ago may have led to the speciation of the bonobo. Their population is between 29,000 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is threatened by habitat destruction, human population growth and commercial poaching. The bonobo lives for about 40 years in captivity, though its lifespan in the wild is unknown."}

It is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus. In Kalhasti, there is a famous and ancient temple of Shiva, a god of Hindus. The temple is one of the five such temples of Shiva in south India collectively known as Pancha Bootha Sthalams. The other four such temples are at Kanchipuram, Thiruvanaikaval, Tiruvannamalai, and Chidambaram.\nIn this temple, people worship Shiva in the form of a linga. There are many mythological stories about this linga. One of the stories tell that an elephant, a snake, and a spider used to worship this linga. The god Shiva blessed them with moksha (liberation).\nAnother story tells about a saint named Kannappa. He took out his eyes and offered the same to the linga. At this supreme sacrifice, Shiva became very happy. He appeared in the form of a human being, and restored the eyesight of Kannappa. Kannappa is worshipped as one of the 63 saiva saints in Tamil Nadu.\nSri Kalahasti temple, 36\u00a0km away is famous for its Vayudeva temple, which is the only shrine of the god of wind in India. Constructed in the 12th century by the Chola king, Rajarajendra, Vayu is incarnated as Lord Shiva and worshipped as Kalahasteeswara.\nThis is an important temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. This temple has one of the elemental lingas, the vayu (air) linga. There is a lamp inside the inner sanctum that is constantly flickering despite the lack of air movement inside. The air-linga can be observed to move even when the pujaris close off the entrance to the main Deity room, which does not have any windows. You can see the flames on several ghee lamps flicker as if blown by moving air. The linga is white and is considered Swayambhu, or self-manifested.\nKalahasti is surrounded by two sacred hills. The Durgamba temple is on the northern hill. On the south hill there is the shrine of Kannabeswara, in memory of the Sage Kannappa, who offered an eye to the Lord. When he tried to offer his other eye as well, the Lord mercifully stopped him. There is also a temple dedicated to Subramanya on one of the surrounding hills.\nThe main linga is untouched by human hands, even by the priest. Abhisheka (bathing) is done by pouring a mixture of water, milk, camphor, and panchamrita. Sandal paste, flowers and the sacred thread are offered to the utsava-murti, not the main linga. \nThis temple is one of the most impressive Siva temples in India. It features an enormous, ancient gopuram (tower) over the main gate. The tower is 36.5m (120\u00a0feet) high. The entire temple is carved out of the side of a huge stone hill. It was built in1516 by King Krishnadeva Raya.\nThe temple is run by neatly dressed Saivite Brahmins."}

His name is written as Rabindranath Thakur in many languages of India. He was a poet, philosopher, and artist. He wrote many stories, novels, poems, and dramas. He is also very well known for composing music. His writings greatly influenced Bengali culture during the late 19th century and early 20th century. In 1913, he became the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nHis major works include \"Gitanjali\" (\"Song Offerings\"), a world-famous poetry book; \"Gora\" (\"Fair-Faced\"); \"Ghare-Baire\" (\"The Home and the World\"); and many other works of literature and art. Tagore was also a cultural reformer and modernized Bengali art. He made it possible to make art using different forms and styles.\nTagore died on August 7, 1941 (\"Baishey Shrabon\" in Bengali, 22nd Shrabon).\nEarly life (1861\u20131878).\nTagore was born in the city of Kolkata (Calcutta), at 6 Dwarkanath Tagore Lahne, Jorasanko Thakur Bari. He was the youngest of his parents' 14 children. His father was Debendranath Tagore. His mother was Sharada Devi.\nTagore was a Bengali Brahman by birth. His nickname was \"Rab\" or \"Rabi\".\nTagore wrote his first poem when he was eight years old. In 1877, at the age of 16, Tagore published his first large poetry collection and wrote his first short story and dramas.\nIn February 1873, at age 11, Tagore went on a tour of India with his father. The tour lasted for several months. They visited many places like Amritsar in Punjab (British India), and Dalhousie in the Himalayas. Tagore also visited his father's estate at Shantiniketan. There he read biographies and studied history, astronomy, modern science, and Sanskrit. He also read works of Kalidas.\nDuring this time, Tagore also composed many literary works. One of them was a long poem in Maithili (the language spoken by the people of Mithila, India). Tagore wrote a poem in the style of Vidyapati, a famous poet who wrote in Maithili.\nIn 1878, Tagore went to London. He enrolled at a public school in Brighton, England. He wanted to become a barrister. Later he studied at University College London. But in 1880, after Tagore did not do well in school, his father called him back from London. His father arranged a marriage for him with Mrinalini Devi, a girl of ten years. Child marriage was common during that time. They got married on December 9, 1883. Together they had five children, but two died during childhood.\nIn 1890, Tagore began managing his family's estates in Sheildah, now in Bangladesh. In 1898, Tagore's wife and children joined him there. Tagore traveled across the vast estate. Between 18911895, he wrote many short stories about life in Bengal, especially rural life.\nShantiniketan.\nIn 1901, Tagore left Sheildah. He went to Shantiniketan (West Bengal) to build an ashram (which is like a monastery in Indian religions). In English, \"Shantiniketan\" means \"an abode [place] of peace\". He built a prayer hall, a school, and a library. He planted many trees and built a garden.\nTagore's wife and two of his children died in Shantiniketan. On January 19, 1905, Tagore's father also died.\nBy this time, Tagore had started receiving monthly income as part of his inheritance. He also started receiving some royalties for his literary works. He was very popular among readers of the Bengali language, as well as other people who knew his works through translations and reviews.Rabindranath's father bought a large parcel of land in Santiniketan, intending to establish a preparatory school.\nOn November 13, 1913, Tagore won the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Swedish Academy had selected him based on a small number of his translated works, and his 1912 work of poems named \"Gitanjali: Song Offerings\".\nThe British Crown gave Tagore a knighthood in 1915. However, he gave back the title in 1919 to protest the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in Amritsar. During this massacre, troops of the British Raj killed people who had no weapons.\nIn 1921, Tagore and an agricultural economist named Leonard K. Elmhirst set up the Institute for Rural Reconstruction in a village named Surul, near Tagore's ashram at Shantiniketan. Tagore recruited many scholars and officials from many countries to help the Institute. Its goal was to use schooling to \"free village[s] from ... helplessness and ignorance\".\nIn the early 1930s, Tagore also grew more concerned about India's \"abnormal caste consciousness\" and differences based on castes. He lectured on the evils of such practices and also wrote many poems and dramas on these themes. He also became an activist.\nLast years (1932\u20131941).\nEven during the last decade of his life, Tagore continued his activism. He criticized Mohandas Gandhi, one of India's leaders, for his comments about an earthquake on January 15, 1934 in Bihar. Gandhi had said the earthquake had happened because God wanted to punish people for practicing casteism.\nTagore also wrote a hundred-line poem about the poverty in Kolkata. Later on, Satyajit Ray based one of his movies on this poem.\nDuring this period, Tagore wrote fifteen volumes of prose-poems. They covered many parts of human life. In his last years, Tagore took an interest in science and wrote a collection of essays. These essays explored biology, physics, and astronomy.\nTagore spent the last four years of his life in poor health. In late 1937, he lost consciousness. He was in a coma for a long time. Eventually, he woke up, but three years later, he went back into a coma. During these years, whenever he was conscious and felt well enough, he wrote poems. These poems talk about how he came close to death. Tagore died on August 7, 1941 at the age of 80 in his childhood home in Kolkata.\nTravels.\nBetween 1878 and 1932, Tagore visited thirty countries on five continents. His goal was to make his literary works known to people who did not speak Bengali. He also spread his thoughts and ideas, including his political ideas.\nIn 1912, Tagore went to England. The Anglo-Irish poet William Butler Yeats wrote the preface to the English translation of Tagore's famous book \"Gitanjali\" (\"Song Offerings\"). Tagore also met Ezra Pound, Robert Bridges, Ernest Rhys, Thomas Sturge Moore, and many others.\nFrom May 1916 until April 1917, Tagore gave many lectures in Japan. Shortly after returning to India, the 63-year-old Tagore visited Peru at the invitation of the Peruvian government. At the same time, he also visited Mexico. Both governments pledged donations of $100,000 to Tagore's school at Shantiniketan.\nOn May 30, 1926, Tagore reached Naples, Italy. The next day, he met fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in Rome. On 20 July 1926, Tagore criticized and spoke out against Mussolini.\nIn July 1927, Tagore and two friends went on a four-month tour of Southeast Asia. They visited Bali, Java (island), Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Siam, and Singapore. Later on, Tagore wrote a book named \"Jatri\" (\"The Traveler\") about his experiences during these trips.\nIn early 1930, Tagore left Bengal for a nearly year-long tour of Europe and the United States. In Paris and London, there were displays of his paintings. During this period, Tagore wrote his Hibbert Lectures for the University of Oxford. He also met Aga Khan III.\nFrom June to mid-September 1930, Tagore toured Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany. Next, he toured the Soviet Union.\nTagore's travels gave him the opportunity to talk with many notable persons of his time. They included Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Robert Frost, Mahatma Gandhi, Thomas Mann, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Romain Rolland.\nTagore's last trips abroad were his visits to Iran and Iraq in 1932, and to Ceylon in 1933. He visited Iran as a personal guest of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\nWorks.\nTagore was mainly a poet, but his other writing includes essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. He was also an expert painter.\nMany movies also have soundtracks featuring selections from Tagore's songs, the \"Rabindra Sangeet\".\nTagore also wrote many non-fiction books. These covered many subjects, including the history of India, linguistics, essays and lectures, details of his travels, and other autobiographical things.\nOne of his famous dramas is 2 plays by Tagore and Dipashri\nIn 1917, Tagore published a book called \"My Reminiscences\". In this book, Tagore gives credit to his friend and mentor, Akshay Chowdhury, for influencing him in literature since he was a child. Akshay was the youngest son of Mihir Chandra Chowdhury, whose ancestry was linked with the Dutta Chowdhury (Chowdhuries) family of Andul. Rabindranath used to call Akshay \"Akshay Babu\".\nAkshay Chowdhury, Romesh Chandra Dutt, and Jyotiridranath Tagore were classmates at Hindu School in Kolkata. Because of this, Akshay developed a strong, friendly relationship with the Tagore family.\nRabindranath wrote that he loved to discuss high-level literature in detail with \"Akshay Babu\". At times, Akshay and his wife, Sarat Kumari Chaudhurani, used to participate in long talks about literature in a garden at \"Thakur Bari\".\nMusic and artwork.\nTagore was also a musician and painter. He wrote around 2,230 songs. People call these songs \"Rabindra Sangeet\" (which means \"Tagore Song\" in English). These songs are now a part of modern Bengali culture. Tagore's many poems and songs are parts of his novels and stories.\nHis songs and music cover many aspects of human emotion, devotional hymns, and love songs. In most Bengali-speaking families, people sing \"Rabindra Sangeet\"'.\nMusic critic Arther Strangeways of \"The Observer\" first introduced Tagore's songs to non-Bengalis through his book \"The Music of Hindustan\". The book describes Tagore Song as a \"vehicle of a personality ... [that goes] behind this or that system of music to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize.\" Rabindra Sangeet has two great works, which are now national anthems of two countries: India and Bangladesh. This makes Tagore the only person in the world to have written the national anthems of two nations. They are Bangladesh's \"Amar Sonaar Baanglaa\" and India's \"Jana Gana Mana\". \"Rabindrasangit\". They are also influenced by musicians like Vilayat Khan, Buddhadev Dasgupta, and composer Amjad Ali Khan.\nAt age 60, Tagore took an interest in drawing and painting. He used many styles from different parts of the world. His styles included craftwork by the Malanggan people of northern New Ireland, Haida carvings from the Pacific Northwest region of North America, and woodcuts by Max Pechstein. Sometimes, Tagore used his handwriting in artistic styles on his manuscripts. His drawings and paintings were displayed in France and London.\nTheatrical pieces.\nWhen he was 16 years old, he performed in a drama organized by his brother, Jyotirindranath Tagore. When Tagore was 20 years old, he wrote a drama named \"Valmiki Pratibha\" (\"The Genius of Valmiki\"). This described the life of Valmiki, a man who stopped being a robber and became a learned person, his blessing from the goddess Saraswati, and his writing of the Ramayana.\nAnother notable play by him is \"Dak Ghar\" (\"The Post Office\"), which describes how a child tries to escape from his confinement and falls asleep. This sleeping is suggestive of death. This play received reviews in many parts of Europe. In 1890, he wrote \"Visarjan\" (\"Sacrifice\"). Many scholars believe this to be his finest drama. The Bangla-language original versions included intricate sub-plots and extended monologues. He wrote many other dramas on a variety of themes. In Tagore's own words, he wrote them as \"the play of feeling and not of action\". Rabindra Nritya Natya means dance dramas based on Tagore's plays.\nShort stories.\nTagore wrote many stories. \"Galpaguchchha\" (Bunch of Stories) is a three-volume collection of eighty-four of his stories. Tagore wrote about half of these stories during the period from 1891 to 1895. This collection continues to be very popular work of Bangla literature. These stories have been used for many movies and theatrical plays.\nTagore drew inspiration and ideas for writing his stories from his surroundings, from the village life of India. He saw the poor people very closely during travels to manage his family's large landholdings. Sometimes he used different themes to test the depth of his intellect.\nPoetry.\nTagore's poetry is very varied and covers many styles. He drew inspiration from 15th and 16th century poets and from ancient writers like Vasa. Bengal's Baul folk singers were also influenced by his style of poetry. He wrote many poems when he was at Shelidah managing his family's estates. Many of his poems have a lyrical quality. These poems tell about the \"man within the heart\" and the \"living God within\". Over the next 70 years, he repeatedly revised his style of writing poetry. In 1930s, he wrote many experimental works of poetry, and also used modernism and realism in his works.\nOne of his poems reads \"all I had achieved was carried off on the golden boat; only I was left behind\". Tagore is known around the world for his \"Gitanjali\" (\"Song Offerings\"), his best-known collection, which won him his Nobel Prize. A freeverse translation by Tagore of a verse of \"Gitanjali\" reads as follows:\nAnthems.\nTagore is the only person to have written anthems for three countries.\nPolitical views.\nTagore's political views were complicated. He criticized European colonialism and supported Indian nationalists. But he also criticized the Swadeshi movement that many nationalist leaders in India liked. He liked self-help and learning. He asked Indians to accept \"there can be no question of blind revolution, but of steady and purposeful education\". Many people did not like his thinking. In late 1916, some Indians plotted to kill him when he was staying in a hotel in San Francisco, USA. When they saw him face-to-face, however, they instead started arguing with Tagore and changed their minds about killing him. Tagore also wrote many songs praising the Indian independence movement. He also returned the British honor of Knighthood as a protest against the 1919 Amritsar massacre. In Amritsar, troops of the British Raj had opened fire on unarmed civilians, killing many. Despite his unfriendly relations with Gandhi, Tagore played a key role in resolving a Gandhi-B. R. Ambedkar dispute which was about separate electorates for untouchables. Untouchables were people considered lowest in the social order. Rabindranath Tagore helped the freedom of India. He was first to identify the theme of \"Globalization\".\nInsert non-formatted text here\nEducational views.\nTagore was also critical abnout the traditional style of education. While on a visit to Santa Barbara, California on October 11, 1917, he thought of a new type of education: a new type of university which he wanted to set up at Shantiniketan. On December 22, 1918, work for building the new university began. It opened on December 22, 1921. He named the university Visva-Bharati University. Tagore worked hard to raise funds for the university, and he toured many parts of Europe and the United States for this purpose. He gave all his Nobel Prize money to this university. The university gave personal guidance to all students. Students lived close to nature, and the teacher-student relationship followed a pattern of the gurukul system of ancient India. In his own words, he wanted this university to become \"a world center for the study of humanity ... somewhere beyond the limits of nation and vidusha geography\".\nHe also had a dream for the future India. He wanted India's freedom from the British rule. He dreamt of an India \"where the mind is without fear\".\nLegacy.\nEven many decades after his death, people hold festivals in his honor in many parts of the world. Examples include the following:\nNobel laureate Amartya Sen, who is also a Bengali, once noted that even for modern Bengalis, Tagore was a \"towering figure\", being a \"deeply relevant and many-sided contemporary thinker\".\nTagore's collected 1939 Bangla-language writings (Rab\u012bndra Rachan\u0101val\u012b) are one of Bengal's greatest cultural treasures, and Tagore himself has been proclaimed \"the greatest poet India has produced\".\nHe was also famous in much of Europe, North America, and East Asia. Translations of his works are available in many languages, including Russian, English, Dutch, German, and Spanish. In the United States, Tagore gave many lectures during 1916 and 1917. Many people attended those lectures.\nBetween 1914 and 1922, the Jim\u00e9nez-Camprub\u00ed spouses translated at least twenty-two of Tagore's books from English into Spanish. These Spanish translations influenced many leading figures of Spanish literature, including Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral of Chile; Octavio Paz of Mexico; and Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, Zenobia Camprub\u00ed, and Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez of Spain\nVarious composers, including classical composer Arthur Shepherd\u2019s, have set Tagore's poetry to music."}

Some of them are Brahui people, Kannadigas, Malayalis, Telugu people and Tuluvas. Tamil people, are not closely related to people in the Middle East and Europe, except the Romani people.\nTamil people identify themselves with their language, Tamil and their rich culture and literature. In recent times, they have broadened the definition of Tamil people. They now also include descendants of Tamil speaking people even when they no longer speak Tamil language.\nHistory.\nThe history of Tamil people has three broad time periods as described below.\nThe pre-classical period.\nNo one is sure about the exact origins of the Tamil people. Some connect them with the Elamite people of ancient Iran. Historians confirmed with the scripts and names of towns of Indus that the people of the Indus Valley Civilization were Tamil. \nIn Tamil Nadu, the earliest presence of Tamil people dates back to around 10000 BC on wards. Archaeologists have found many burial places of megalithic era. The style of burials is same as described in classical Tamil literature. Recent excavations at these sites have also provided samples of early Tamil writing, dating back to at least 5000 BC (\"The Hindu\", 2005). \nThe classical period.\nThree royal families emerged in the lands of the Tamil people: the dynasties of the Cholas, Cheras, and the Pandyas. \nAt that time, agriculture and trading were two main economic activities of Tamil people. They even traded with many other countries, including places in Europe. In Karur (Tamil Nadu), archaeologists found a large number of coins of Ancient Rome and Egypt. The Pandyas sent at least two ambassadors to the Roman Emperor Augustus. Archaeologists have also found Tamil writings in broken pieces of pottery in the Red Sea, where Tamil Merchants settled there and became one of the Acestor the Romani people, as DNA studys shows.\nAn unnamed traveler from ancient Greece had described in Greek language ports of the Pandya as \"The land of Punt\" and Chera kings. He had detailed the items exported by the Tamil people. These items included black pepper, pearls, ivory, silk, diamonds, sapphires, and tortoiseshell.\nThe classical period ended at around 2nd century. People from northern parts of India invaded the lands of the Tamil people. For Tamil people, this was a dark period of their history called kalapiraras. They are the Jewish Invaders from Western coast of Karnataka and Kerala with help of the local Telugu tribal's who lived in the jungles of Western ghats and chambal. This dark phase ended with the rise of the Pandyas and Pallava dynasty again.\nThe imperial and post-imperial periods.\nHistorical records of ancient Tamil rulers have been destroyed on purpose. Only later pallava period is mentioned during the 6th century, they became powerful after they drove the kalapirars. Later The Pallavas also encouraged the worship of Shiva and Vishnu; and built large temples.\nIn the 9th century, the Cholas and the Pandyas defeated Pallavas. By the 10th century, the Cholas had established a big empire, covering most of south India and Sri Lanka. They had a strong navy, That reached Thailand, Burma and Sumatra. They also had a strong trading links with China. By the 12th \u2013 13th centuries, the power of the Cholas had declined. For some time, Pandyas became powerful. However, by that time Muslim rulers invaded Tamil lands. The Pandya dynasty came to an end by the 16th century.\nOver a period of time, western parts of Tamil lands were developing in a separate manner. By the 13th century, the Cholas and the Pandyas had lost control over these areas. The people living there developed their own language and culture. By the 15th century they had a separate language, Malayalam language, now the language of the Indian state of Kerala.\nAfter 16th century no major rulers emerged to rule Tamil lands. But, there were many smaller local rulers. For some time, rulers from the present day Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh also ruled over the Tamil lands. By the 17th century, Europeans from the United Kingdom, France and Denmark started to establish their settlements in Tamil lands. They fought many battles. Finally, the British won, and by the end of the 18th century, most of the Tamil lands came under the British rule.\nTamils in Sri Lanka.\nBefore the deluge at about 11600 yrs, Sri Lanka was a part of Tamil Nadu and Tamil rulers of the ancient pandyas ruled this place.After deluge Sri Lanka separated from Tamil Nadu. One north Indian king of Tamil origin exiled his son Vijayan out of country for his wrongdoing Vijayan with a small troop reached Sri Lanka. The Tamil Nagas, Yakkars and vedars were the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka before Vijanyan's arrival and the land was under Pandiyan control. Pandiyan of Madurai welcomed Vijayan with good heart and facilitated his troops.He sent Tamil girls from Pandiyan kingdom to marry Vijayan and for his troops.The Tamil people ruled parts of Sri Lanka from time to time, and played important role in the ruling of Sri Lanka. In the 10th century, the Chola kings made Sri Lanka a part of their kingdom. This continued until late 11th century.\nAfter decline of the Chola power in Sri Lanka, different rulers ruled Sri Lanka, the Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty from 1215.Thou the name says Arya chakravarthi it is a debate that their surnames says SANGILI which is a pure Tamil origin name of Tamil root. The Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty ruled over large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until 1619. By this time the Portuguese and the Dutch won many areas of Sri Lanka. However, in 1796, the British won entire Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka became part of the British Empire..\nThe modern period.\nDuring the British Raj, the British combined all Tamil lands and gave them a new name, the Madras Presidency. The Madras Presidency became a part of the British Raj. Similarly, the British combined Tamil lands of Sri Lanka and other regions of Sri Lanka in 1802. This became the Ceylon colony, also a part of the British Empire. When India became independent in 1947, Madras Presidency became a part of India. Ceylon became independent in 1948, and the Tamil lands remained a part of independent Ceylon, now called Sri Lanka.\nAfter India\u2019s independence in 1947, Madras Presidency became Madras State. It covered the areas of present-day Tamil Nadu, coastal parts of Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, northern Kerala, and the southwest of Karnataka. The Government of India rearranged (1956) the boundaries of many states of India based on language. Thus, the present day state of Tamil Nadu came into existence.\nAt the beginning, there was a demand for an independent country for the Tamil people. However, the constitution of India gave major rights to the states, and protected the speakers of regional languages from compulsory speaking and use of Hindi. This satisfied most of the Tamil people, and presently there is no demand for a separate country for Tamil people outside the federal system of India.\nHowever, in Sri Lanka, the government did not give sufficient rights to people who spoke Tamil language. During 1970s, this led to a demand for independence of Tamil people and the Sri Lankan Civil War.\nGeographic distribution.\nTamil people live in many geographical regions. Sections below describe them.\nIn India.\nMost of the Tamil people of India live in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Most of the people living in Pondicherry of India are also Tamil people.\nTamil people have been traditionally living in some other parts of India - for examples, Hebbar and Mandyam Tamils of southern Karnataka, the Tamils of Palakkad in Kerala, and the Tamils of Pune, Maharashtra. For last one hundred years or so, Tamil people went to many other parts of India for jobs or business. Some of them settled in these places.\nIn Sri Lanka.\nPresently, there are two groups of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The first group is Sri Lankan Tamils. They are descendants of the Tamil people who lived in the old Jaffna kingdom or who migrated to the East coast. The second group is Hill Country Tamils. They descended from the Tamil people who went to Sri Lanka from India as laborers in the 19th century-early 20th century. The first group mostly lives in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka. The second group mostly live in the central highlands.\nIn 1949, some political developments in Sri Lanka were adverse for Tamil people of Sri Lanka. Many Tamils people lost their citizenship of being citizens of Sri Lanka. Under an agreement between the governments of India and Sri Lanka, about 40% of these Tamils could get back their citizenship. Many others had to shift to India. These developments brought the two groups of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka closer. By 1990s, most of the Tamil people had got back their citizenship.\nIn other places.\nBeginning from the 18th century, many poor Tamil people went as laborers to many countries of the British Empire. Some of these countries were Malaya, South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius and the Caribbean. At the same time, many Tamil businessmen also went to places in Burma and East Africa. Many Tamils still live in these countries.\nSpecial mention may be made of Singapore. The government has made Tamil language as one of the national languages although only 4.2% of the people speak Tamil language in Singapore.\nBy 1980s many Tamil people of Sri Lanka were facing ethnic conflicts. Many of them fled to Australia, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia. Today, the largest concentration of Tamils outside southern Asia is in Toronto, Canada.\nIn recent years, many young Tamil professionals from India (particularly computer programmers) have gone to Europe and the United States.\nCulture.\nLanguage and literature.\nTamil people call their language as \"the Tamil mother.\" They identify themselves based on their language.\nTamil language, like other languages of south India, is one of the Dravidian languages. It is not related to the Indo-European languages of the north India. Although modern speakers of Tamil language use a number of words of Sanskrit and English, Tamil language has maintained its original classical character. The Government of India has recently recognized Tamil language as one of the classical languages of India.\nClassical Tamil literature is varied. For example, they cover poetry and lyrics; works of ethics and philosophy; and many other types of literary works. Notable works in classical Tamil literature include the Tirukkural by Thiruvalluvar, The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature and the works of Auvaiyar. Over many centuries, the written Tamil has changed very little. Thus, even modern Tamil people are able to read and enjoy these classical literary works.\nModern Tamil literature is also varied. It has many aspects: for example, Indian nationalism, historical romanticism, and social realism. In recent years, many works of Tamil language in Sri Lanka describe the tragedy of ethnic conflict and civil war. Tamil people living in many other places have also produced literary works.\nSome of the note-worthy poets are Bharathiyar, Barathidasen, etc... of end of 19th century who depicts the originality of Tamil culture and India, penned several notarary poems on Tamil and National interest.\nVisual arts.\nTamil visual arts have three main forms: architecture, sculpture and painting. The theme is generally religious, showing aspects of Hinduism.\nTanjore painting is the most important form of painting of Tamil people. The painting originated in a place named Tanjore (modern name: Thanjavur). This style of painting originated in the 9th century. In this style of painting, the painter paints on a piece of cloth. Sometimes, the painter also decorates the painting with threads of gold and silver, and precious gems. There is one other type of important painting style. Painters make paintings on the walls of temples. Tamil paintings use rich colors and show minute details.\nIn their sculpture, artists use bronze. Several pieces of sculptures are found throughout Tamil Nadu, particularly in temples. Most of them are very old, dating from the 7th century onwards. The sculptures show very minute details, including details of ornaments and dress. Many sculptures also show movement with fine details. Two important examples of such sculptures are: the cave sculptures at Mamallapuram and Nataraja statue at Chidambaram.\nThere are many temples in the lands of Tamil people. The gates of these temples, called Gopuram, are higher than other parts. Earlier Gopurams were simple in construction. From 13th century onwards, they became bigger and have engravings and paintings. The engravings and paintings show scenes and characters from Hindu mythology. Temples at Thanjavur. Chidambaram and Srirangam are very big and fine examples of temples of Tamil people.\nTamil art is an important tradition of Indian art.\nPerforming arts.\nThe Tamil people have many performing arts. The classical Tamil literature has many details of these performing arts.\nClassical music of Tamil people is carnatic music. The classical Tamil literature records details about the carnatic music. This is a vocal music with use of musical instruments. Carnatic music is completely religious.\nTamil folk music is very different from the carnatic music. The folk music shows a lot of excitement. The songs may convey folklore and other popular tales.\nBharatanatyam is the main dance of the Tamil people. Generally one dancer performs this dance. The dance tells a story through movements of parts of body, particularly hands. Until 1930s, girls known as devadasis performed this dance in temples. Now, it has become common, and there are many famous dancers who perform this dance. Tamil people also have many types of folk dances performed in villages. Sometimes they perform such a dance before the village goddess called Mariamma.\nTamil people also have a long tradition of theatrical performance. In villages, performers perform in the open. They dance and sing, and some times tell stories. These stories may be religious stories or on any other topic.\nTamil Nadu has a well-developed tradition of stage theatre tradition. Presently, both classical and folk performing arts survive in modern Tamil society.\nTamil people like to watch movies. Tamil movies are famous for technical details, artistic presentation, and entertainment. Most of the Tamil movies will have some songs and dances. Kollywood is the popular term for the Tamil film industry\nReligion.\nMost of the Tamil people are Hindus. However, many are Muslims and Christians. At one time, Jainism was one of the major religions of Tamil people. However, presently there are only few thousand Tamil Jains.\nIn Tamil Hinduism, the most popular deity is god named Murugan. He is a form of Karthikeya, the son of Shiva. The Tamil people also worship mother goddess Amman or Mariamman. Many Tamil people also worship Kannagi, a folk heroine. Throughout Tamil lands, there are many temples of Shiva, Vishnu, and Ganesha (Ganpathi). In rural areas of Tamil Nadu, people worship many local gods and goddesses. They call them aiyyanar.\nThere were many saints known as Alvars and Nayanars. In the 10th century, Ramanuja propagated his philosophy about worship and also accepted lower caste-Hindus as his disciples. There were many other notable Tamil saints. The Ramayana has many parts based in Tamil regions and according to legends, many of Rama's soldiers were Tamil people.\nThe most important Tamil festivals are Pongal and the Tamil New Year. Pongal is a harvest festival and people celebrate this in mid-January. Tamil people also celebrate Diwali. Two other important Hindu festivals of Tamil people are Thaipusam, and Adipperukku.\nThe most important Tamil Muslims festivals are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.\nMartial arts.\nA Tamil legend states that the Cholas, Chera and Pandyan kings fought many wars in the 1st century. The war lasted for about one hundred years. During this period, the Tamil people perfected many martial arts. All these styles of martial arts still exist. They also developed many weapons.\nThere are many types of martial arts. For example, in a special type of martial art called Silambam, a person would use a stick of about 1.6 meters long. By moving the stick he would try to defend against attack by several persons. In another type of martial art, persons get training to defend themselves without using any weapons, by using their hands and legs.\nVarma Kalai (Tamil: \u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bae\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb2\u0bc8) is a martial art and esoteric healing art originating from ancient Tamil Nadu in South India. The name literally translate as \"The Art of Vital Points\". It is an element of the Tamil martial art Kuttu varisai.[1]\nIn some parts of Tamil Nadu, notably Alanganallur (near Madurai), some Tamil people hold annual event around Pongal festival: called \" Manju virattu \" in Tamil (bullfighting}).\nMovements.\nPeriyar E. V. Ramasamy, a social leader of Tamil people started a movement named Self-respect Movement. It was to promote self-respect and remove social evils like casteism. Many people call this movement as the Dravidian movement. All political parties of Tamil Nadu draw their principles from this movement.\nScholars of India and Sri Lanka have developed a vocabulary in Tamil language for words of science and technology.\nIn the 1960s, the government of Tamil Nadu held a World Tamil Conference. The Conference has been meeting regularly.\nIn 1999, many Tamil people organized a World Tamil Confederation. Its purpose is to protect and promote Tamil culture and bring a sense of togetherness amongst Tamils in different countries. The Confederation has since adopted a Tamil flag and Tamil song to act as symbols for the Tamil people living in different countries. The words on the flag quote the opening line of a poem by the classical poet Kaniyan Pungundranar. These words mean: \u201cAll lands are our home; all people are our kin.\u201d\nIn Sri Lanka, the Federal Party (later the Tamil United Liberation Front) took the lead in Tamil politics. However, by 1980s, political movements took a back seat in Tamil politics of Sri Lanka. Many military groups had started conflicts, and a civil war broke out. The Tamil Tigers emerged as the most important force amongst these military groups. The Tamil Tigers are fighting to establish its own government in areas where Tamil people are in majority. Presently they control many areas, and are negotiating for peace."}

It may be mild or severe. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental age of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but it truly depends on the person. This can vary widely, but most individuals need supervision if they are to live their lives in a satisfactory way. Children who have this condition take more time to learn new things.\nThe condition is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who first described it in 1866. He called it \"mongoloid idiocy\" because he thought that children with Down syndrome had faces like that of Blumenbach's Mongolian race. Idiocy meant intellectual disability. People do not use the term \"mongoloid idiocy\" today. It is a rude term.\nThere is sometimes discrimination against people with Down syndrome, both in the education system and in society in general. Some people with the condition have average intelligence, but may have other problems with development instead. People with Down syndrome often have a different shape of eyes than most people. A few people with the condition have severe learning difficulties.\nOf every 800 to 1000 babies that are born, one is diagnosed with Down syndrome. Older women have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. If they have a procedure known as amniocentesis, pregnant mothers can be told whether their foetus has Down syndrome. Sound scans may also diagnose the presence of Down Syndrome. Mothers whose foetus is diagnosed as having Downs syndrome may choose to have an abortion. In the United Kingdom and Europe 92% of such cases are aborted.\nFeatures.\nThey also grow differently from other children. Babies with down syndrome can be identified at birth because they may have a specific set of physical features. These features include narrow eyes, a flat nose-bridge, smaller mouths and shorter fingers. Smaller mouths can result in tongue protrusion or what looks like a large tongue. Sometimes the little fingers curve inwards as well, and there is also often a space between the big toe and the others. People with Down syndrome often have heart defects or Alzheimer's disease when they are older. About 90% of people with Down syndrome live through their teens. The lifespan of a person with Down syndrome averages between 50 and 55 years old.\nSo far there have been no treatments for Down syndrome.\nGenetic causes.\nDown syndrome comes from a problem with the genes. Humans are diploid organisms. This means that for each chromosome, there are two copies, one from the mother, and one from the father. During meiosis the number is reduced to one set of chromosomes. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it.\nThere are three ways that Down syndrome is caused. The most common cause of Down syndrome is trisomy. Trisomy is when the child receives two chromosomes from the mother and one from the father. This makes it so there are three chromosomes of chromosome #21. Another way Down syndrome is caused is when new cells are made. Sometimes even when the parent cells are normal chromosome 21 can be deformed when cells reproduce. This makes it so some cells have 47 chromosomes and others have 46. This is called a mosaic disorder. Mosaic means that they have a third chromosome from the replication of cells. The third way Down syndrome can be caused is called translocation. This happens when a normal chromosome breaks into two pieces. This results in three chromosomes.\nOther websites.\nFor comprehensive lists of Down syndrome links see\nSocieties and Associations.\nBy Country"}

They are heritable, and \"may\" be passed down from the parents' genes to their children and to later generations. If a genetic disorder is present from birth, it is described as a congenital defect. Some defects only show up in later life. \nThe mutation responsible can occur spontaneously before the embryo develops, or it can be inherited from parents who are carriers of a faulty gene.\nMost genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or even millions. Sometimes they are relatively frequent in a population. If they are frequent, it suggests these recessive gene disorders give an advantage in certain environments when only one copy of the gene is present. Sickle cell anaemia is an example of this.\nThe same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic causes in still other people. A disease is only called a genetic disease if it can be inherited."}

{"id": "33427", "revid": "795348", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33427", "title": "Cleveland Guardians", "text": "The Cleveland Guardians are a Major League Baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. They are part of the American League Central Division. Under the team's former name of Cleveland Indians, the Guardians won two World Series championships in 1920 and 1948. Currently, they hold the longest championship drought in MLB.\nThe team was founded in 1894 in Grand Rapids, Michigan as the Grand Rapids Rustlers, playing in the late-1890s Western League, which became the American League in 1900. In that same year, the team moved to Cleveland, taking the name of Lake Shores. The next year, the team became the Cleveland Bluebirds, also known as Blues. Players didn't like that name, and failed in a try to change the name to \"Broncos\" in 1902. In that same year, the team traded for star player Nap Lajoie, who later became player-manager, and it soon became known as the \"Naps\" in his honor. The team was called the Cleveland Naps until Lajoie left at the end of the 1914 season. \nAfter Lajoie left, the team looked for a new nickname and settled on \"Indians\" for the 1915 season, partly in honor of the Boston Braves who had won the 1914 World Series. In more modern times, their nickname was often thought to be a poor choice. It is considered offensive to name a team for a race or ethnic group. However, there was no serious effort to change the name until the 21st century. After growing criticism, the team started to move away from the nickname in 2018, retiring its controversial \"Chief Wahoo\" logo of a caricatured Native American. In 2020, team owner Paul Dolan announced that the \"Indians\" name would be retired after the 2021 season. The new nickname of Guardians was announced on July 23, 2021.

They live in the top layer of the ocean, called the epipelagic zone. They are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents. The term is in contrast to nekton, who can control their movements. There are three groups:\nPlankton are important in the ocean's food chain. They are the main source of food for almost all fish larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to catching prey. Basking sharks and blue whales feed on them directly; other large fish feed on them indirectly, by eating fish of smaller size, such as herrings.\nThe distribution of plankton is governed more by nutrients than by temperature. Large tracts of ocean are blue and sterile. The reason is that these areas lack one or more crucial nutrients for the photosynthetic plankton, upon whom all the others depend. Broadly speaking, areas near land masses get nutrients by rivers and wind. The key nutrient lacking in the Pacific ocean is iron, essential in molecules such as \"ferredoxins\", iron-sulfur proteins which do electron transfer in a range of metabolic reactions."}

He founded the Ahmadiyya movement within Islam. According to Ahmadi doctrine, he was the last prophet, as well as the Mahdi and the Messiah. He is believed by Ahmadis to be the Mujaddid of the 14th Islamic century. \nBiography.\nEarly life.\nGhulam was born in Qadian, Punjab in India in 1835 the surviving child of twins born to a rich family. He is reported to have spent a lot of time in the mosque and with the study of the Qur'an and his religion, Islam. This did not lead him to fulfill his father's wishes of his son becoming a lawyer or civil servant. He did attempt to become a lawyer but failed the test. In his course of studying religious topics, he would often interact with many Muslims, non-Muslims, and with Christian missionaries whom he would engage in debates.\nPrior to his claim.\nWhen Ghulam was thirty-five years old his father died. At this time Ghulam claimed that God had begun communicating with him, often through direct revelation. Initially, Ghulam's writings from this time were intended to counter what he perceived to be anti-Islamic writings originating from various Christian missionary groups. He also focused on countering the effects of various groups such as the Brahmo Samaj. During this period of his life he was well received by the Islamic clerics of the time.\nPost claim.\nAs time progressed, his writings began to exhibit his claims of being the mujaddid or reformer of his era. These writings were compiled in one of his most well-known works: Barahin Ahmadiyya, a work consisting of 5 volumes while originally planned 50 volumes. He explained that since there is only a dot difference between 50 &amp; 5, therefore his promise was fulfilled. In later volumes, he would essentially claim to be the messiah of Islam. This proved and continues to be very controversial, as traditional Islamic thought holds that Jesus is the Messiah, who himself will return in the flesh at the end of times. Ghulam countered this by claiming that Jesus was dead, and had in fact escaped crucifixion and died in India. According to Ghulam, the promised Mahdi was a spiritual, not military leader as is believed by most Muslims. With this proclamation, he also began to step away from the traditional idea of militant Jihad, and redefined it as a \u201cspiritual\u201d battle rather than a physical one. In addition to these controversial claims, he would later claim that Guru Nanak, the first Sikh Guru, was in fact a Muslim.\nThese writings began to turn the general Muslims ulema (religious clerics) against him, and he was often branded as a heretic. Some accused Ghulam of working for the British who were trying to use him to remove the concept of Jihad from Indian Muslims.\nGhulam founded the Ahmadiyya movement in 1889. He claimed that the Ahmadiyya Movement stood in the same relation to Islam, as Christianity stood to Judaism at the time of Jesus. The mission of the movement according to Ghulam was the prorogation of what he considered to be Islam in its pristine form. Mirza Ghulam's teachings which differed from other Muslims of the time can be summarized as follows:\nMirza Ghulam is widely acknowledged to have devoted his life to furthering the cause of his movement and countering allegations of heresy against his person till his death at Lahore in 1908.\nOrigin of name.\nThe Ahmadiyya movement in Islam was founded in 1889, but the name Ahmadiyya was not adopted until about a decade later. In a manifesto dated November 4, 1900, the founder explained that the name referred to Ahmad, the alternative name of the prophet Mohammed. According to him, \u2018Mohammed\u2019, which means \u2018the praised one\u2019, refers to the glorious destiny of the prophet who adopted the name from about the time of the Hegira; but \u2018Ahmad\u2019 stands for the beauty of his sermons, and for the peace that he was destined to establish in the world through his teachings. According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, these names thus refer to two aspects of Islam, and in later times it was the latter aspect that commanded greater attention. In keeping with this, he believed, his object was to establish peace in the world through the spiritual teachings of Islam. He believed that his message had special relevance for the Western world which according to him had descended into materialism.\nMirza Ghulam Ahmad's legacy.\nOne of the main sources of dispute during his lifetime and continuing since then is Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's use of the terms \u201cNabi\u201d (prophet) and \u201cRasool\u201d (messenger) when referring to himself. Muslims consider the prophet Muhammad to be the last of the prophets and believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's use of these terms is a violation of the concept of \u201cfinality of prophet hood\u201d. His followers fall into two camps in this regard: the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, who believe in a literal interpretation of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's prophethood (with some qualifications), and the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, who believe in a symbolic interpretation of these two terms. This among other reasons caused a split in the movement soon after Ahmad's death.\nFollowers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad have faced relentless persecution of various types over the years. In 1974, the Pakistani parliament amended the Pakistani constitution to declare Ahmadi Muslims as non-Muslims for purposes of the constitution of the Islamic Republic. In 1984, a series of changes in the Pakistan Penal Code sections relating to blasphemy that, in essence, made it illegal for Ahmadis to preach their religion openly as Islam, leading to 1000s of arrests and prosecutions."}

Pharmacology could also be defined as the study of how medicine actually works.\nPharmacology is not exactly the same as pharmacy, and a pharmacologist is not exactly the same as a pharmacist. A pharmacologist is a scientist who studies how medicine actually works, and usually works in a science lab. A pharmacist is a health care provider who usually works at a pharmacy. However, there is quite a bit of overlap between these two fields. A pharmacist could be considered a type of pharmacologist. While in school, pharmacists do take many classes in pharmacology.\nOrigin of the word.\nIf something can be used as a medicine, it is called a pharmaceutical. Pharmacology includes how drugs are made, how they interact with living organisms, what harmful effects they could have, how they can be used as medicines, and if they can be used to prevent illness. A person who works in the study of pharmacology is called a pharmacologist. Pharmacologists work in a team with biochemists, geneticists, microbiologists, toxicologists and pharmacists to run clinical tests on how drugs work.\nUses of pharmacology.\nThe development of drugs is very important to medicine, but it also has strong economical and political uses. To protect people and prevent abuse, some countries try to control the way in which drugs are made, sold, and administered.\nScientific background.\nTo study chemicals, a person needs to know a lot about what will be affected if it is ingested (taken into the body). As more people know about cell biology and biochemistry, the field of pharmacology has changed as well. It is now possible to design chemicals that do specific things.\nA chemical can have different properties. Pharmacokinetics describes the what effect the body will have on the chemical, and pharmacodynamics describes the chemical's effect on the body (desired or toxic).\nWhen a pharmacologist is talking about pharmacokinetic properties of a chemical, they are interested in four things: ADME.\nMedication is said to have a narrow or wide therapeutic index. This describes the ratio of desired effect to toxic effect. A medicine with a narrow therapeutic index (close to one) only does what people want it to do when the amount given is enough to put the organism in danger. A medicine with a wide therapeutic index (greater than five) does what people want it to do and does not necessarily put the organism in danger. Medication with a narrow margin are more difficult to dose and give to a person, and may require therapeutic drug monitoring (examples are warfarin, some antiepileptics, aminoglycoside antibiotics). Most anti-cancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic margin; toxic side-effects are almost always encountered at doses needed to kill tumours.\nDrugs as medicine.\nDrugs that are given to people to help cure them of a medical condition or help reduce the symptoms are often licensed. They can be divided into three groups: over-the-counter, where anybody can buy the drug from a shop; prescription-only medicine, where a doctor has to say that a person is allowed to take a drug; and in some countries, pharmacy medicines, where only a registered pharmacy can sell a drug. Most over-the-counter medication will not hurt a person if they take a bit more than they are meant to. Medications are often produced by pharmaceutical companies and are often patented. Drugs that are not patented are called generic drugs."}

They are now spoken all over the world.\nThe Indo-European languages are a family of several hundred related languages and dialects, including most major languages in Europe, the Iranian plateau, and South Asia.\nHistorically, the language family was also important in Anatolia and Central Asia. \nThe earliest Indo-European writing is from the Bronze Age in Anatolian and Mycenaean Greek. The origin of Proto-Indo-European is after the invention of farming since some of its words have to do with farming.\nAlthough it may have fewer languages than some other language families, it has the most native speakers, about 2.7 billion. \nOf the 20 languages with the most speakers, 12 are Indo-European: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, German, Sindhi, Punjabi, Marathi, French, and Urdu.\nFour of the six official languages of the United Nations are Indo-European: English, Spanish, French, and Russian.\nMain language groups.\nThese are the main Indo-European language groups:\nMost Indo-European languages use the Latin script, but others use the Devanagari, Cyrillic, or Arabic scripts.\nSummary.\nThe number of speakers derived from statistics or estimates (2019) and were rounded:\nHistory of Indo-European linguistics.\nSuggestions of similarities between Indian and European languages began to be made by European visitors to India in the 16th century. In 1583, Thomas Stephens, an English Jesuit missionary in Goa, India, noticed similarities between the Indian languages and Greek and Latin and included them included in a letter to his brother, but it was not published until the 20th century.\nThe first account to mention Sanskrit is from Filippo Sassetti. Born in Florence, Italy, in 1540, he was a merchant who was among the first Europeans to study the Sanskrit. Writing in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian such as \"deva\u1e25\"/\"dio\" \"God\", \"sarpa\u1e25\"/\"serpe\" \"serpent\", \"sapta\"/\"sette\" \"seven\", \"a\u1e63\u1e6da\"/\"otto\" \"eight\", \"nava\"/\"nove\" \"nine\"). However, neither observation led to further scholarly inquiry.\nIn 1647, the Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn noted the similarity among Indo-European languages and supposed that they had derived from a primitive common language. He included in his hypothesis Dutch, Greek, Latin, Persian, and German, and he later added Slavic, Celtic, and Baltic languages. However, his suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research.\nGaston Coeurdoux and others had made similar observations. Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek conjugations in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship between the languages. Similarly, Mikhail Lomonosov compared different languages groups of the world, including Slavic, Baltic, Iranian, Finnish, Chinese, Hottentot and others.\nThe hypothesis reappeared in 1786, 20 years after Coeurdoux, when Sir William Jones lectured on the striking similarities between three of the oldest languages known in his time: Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. He later tentatively added Gothic, Celtic, and Old Persian but made some errors and omissions in his classification.\nIn 1813, Thomas Young was first to use the term \"Indo-European\". It became the standard scientific term except in Germany through Franz Bopp's \"Comparative Grammar\". Appearing between 1833 and 1852, it was the starting point of Indo-European studies as an academic discipline. \nSome 20th-century scholars thought Indo-European languages started in Armenia or India, but most now think that it started in Eastern Europe or Anatolia."}

The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveoli. These help to take out oxygen from the air. In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflamed. They fill up with a fluid which is called pus, and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before. This makes it hard for the person with pneumonia to breathe. They may feel out of breath, or like they are drowning. They may also feel pain when they breathe. Sometimes people die of pneumonia, even when they go to a hospital and take medicine.\nBackground.\nPneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. It can also be caused by chemical or physical damage done to the lungs. Other illnesses, like alcohol abuse or lung cancer, can also result in pneumonia.\nPeople with pneumonia usually have difficulty breathing. They may also cough, or have pains in the chest area. The treatment of pneumonia depends on how the illness was caused. If it was caused by bacteria, antibiotics can be used to treat it.\nPeople of all ages can have pneumonia. The disease is dangerous. Many people die from pneumonia, especially old people, or people with a weak immune system. \nAccording to some research in 2010, in some parts of the world where people are very poor like India, Nigeria, and Pakistan, pneumonia was the cause of death for more children under the age of five than any other disease. Statistically, however, for every 2,000 children in the developing world who die of pneumonia, only one child in the developed world dies from the disease. This is because of differences in health care and because of differences in rates of breastfeeding, not because of differences in children. Breastfeeding newborn babies greatly increases their ability to survive pneumonia, but some cultures think of breastfeeding as taboo."}

It was also a part-time STD, it can be spread through both sexual and casual contact. \nSARS is a zoonosis: it is a disease which comes from animals: it came from Asian palm civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats. Exactly how the virus got to humans is not known.\nSARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than 24 countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; 774 of these died. \nAfter the Chinese government suppressed news of the SARS outbreak, the disease spread rapidly, reaching Hong Kong and Vietnam in late February 2003, and then to other countries via international travellers. The last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003. There were a total of 8437 known cases of the disease, with 813 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.636%).\nIn May 2005 the disease itself was declared 'eradicated' by the WHO and it became the second disease in mankind to receive this label (the other was smallpox).

It is only done by dancers who have had special training. The dancers are employed by a dance company, and they perform in theatres. The first reference to ballet is found in a work of Domenico da Piacenza, who lived in the early 14th century. \nBallet involves the creation of the dance itself, often a type of imaginary story. The story is told with the help of dance and mime. Ballet is a form of expression. It presents a story in a new form to the audience. The creation of a dance is called choreography. The choreography is learnt by the dancers under the supervision of a trainer, called a ballet master or mistress. Ballet is always performed to music, and in many cases the music was specially composed for a particular ballet. Ballet is a major part of theatre, and a popular example is \"The Nutcracker\".\nHistory.\nEarly stages.\nBallet grew out of Renaissance spectacles which, rather like big pop music events today, used every type of performance art. These Italian ballets were further developed in France. \"Le Ballet Comique de la Reine\" (The Queen's Ballet Comedy) was performed in Paris in 1581. It was staged by Balthazar de Beaujoyeux, a violinist and dancing master at the court of Catherine de Medici. It was danced by amateurs in a hall. The royal family were watching at one end and the others in galleries on three sides. Poetry and songs came with the dances.\nThe basis of classical ballet was formed in the Court of Louis XIV in France, in the 17th century.p40 Even his title (the 'Sun King') came from a role he danced in a ballet. Louis founded the first ballet company, the Ballet de l'Opera de Paris. Many of the ballets presented at his court were created by the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully and the choreographer Pierre Beauchamp. Also during this time, the playwright Moli\u00e8re invented the comedie-ballet.\nModern technique begins.\nIn the early 19th century ballet technique was codified (sorted out and written down) by Carlo Blasis (1797\u20131878) of Naples. His dance classes, four hours long, were famous for being the toughest training there was at that time. 'Romantic ballet' flourished in France in the first half of the 19th century.\nBallet with a more athletic style was developed in Imperial Russia of the late 19th century. This company performed in the Mariinsky Theatre at St. Petersburg. The three famous Tchaikovsky ballets, \"Swan Lake\", \"The Sleeping Beauty\", and \"The Nutcracker\", date from that time. \nThe next stage was the Diaghilev ballet. Diagelev was a great impresario (showman). In 1909 he founded Les Ballets Russes de Sergei Diaghilev, considered by many to be the greatest ballet company of all time.\nHis dancers included the legendary Nijinsky and the Imperial primaballerina Karsavina; also Pavlova, Danilova and Spessivtseva. His choreographers included Fokine, Massine and Balanchine; his composers included Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Ravel and Debussy; his set designers included Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse, Utrillo, Bakst and Braque; and the ballets created changed the course of ballet history.\nLater in the 20th century, permanent ballet companies were set up in English-speaking countries. The Royal Ballet in London was started, and in New York a company called the \"Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo\" was founded (1938\u20131962).\nTechnique.\nTechnique is the physical ability to perform whatever steps a dance may need. Specific methods for refining technique are named after the ballet master or mistress who started them, such as the Vaganova method after Agrippina Vaganova, the Balanchine method after George Balanchine, and the Cecchetti method after Enrico Cecchetti."}

As of 2019, about 1,978,376 people lived there. Quito is the second largest city in Ecuador after Guayaquil. The Historic Center of Quito, Ecuador is one of the largest, least-changed and best-preserved historic centers in the Americas. Quito was designated a World Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1978. It is the first city to be honored in such a way.\nThe Historic Centre of Quito is located in the center south of the capital on an area of 320 hectares (790 acres), and is thought of as one of the most important historic areas in Latin America. There are about 130 monumental buildings (which have a variety of pictorial art and sculpture, mostly of religious inspired in a range of schools and styles) and 5,000 properties registered in the municipal inventory of heritage properties.\nPresidential Palace.\nCarondelet Palace (Spanish: \"Palacio de Carondelet\") is the seat of government of the Republic of Ecuador, located in the historical center of Quito. Axis is the nerve of the public space known as Independence Square or Plaza Grande (colonial name), around which were built in addition the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace, the Hotel Plaza Grande and the Metropolitan Cathedral. The history of this symbolic building dates back to colonial times, around 1570, with the acquisition of the former royal houses located in the city of Quito.\nDuring the Republican era, almost all of the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have dispatched from this building, which is the seat of Government of the Republic of Ecuador. In addition to the administrative units in the third level of the Palace is the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which they live the President and his family. Rafael Correa, president since 2007, thinking that Carondelet Palace and its offices are Ecuadoran heritages, converted the presidential compound into a museum accessible to all who wish to visit it. To this end, areas were organized to place objects within their cultural contexts, to make them accessible to the world, which used several rooms and spaces within the palace.\nChurch of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas.\nConstruction began in 1605, with Mastrilli laying the first stone. The building was not completed until 1765. La Compa\u00f1\u00eda is among the best-known churches in Quito because of its large central nave, which is decorated with gold leaf, gilded plaster and wood carvings. Inspired by two Roman Jesuit churches \u2014 the Chiesa del Ges\u00f9 and the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola \u2014 La Compa\u00f1\u00eda is one of the most significant works of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America.\nIndependence Square.\nAlso known as Big Square (Spanish: Plaza de la Independencia, Plaza Grande). Historic public square of Quito (Ecuador), located in the heart of the old city. This is the central square of the city and one of the symbols of the executive power of the nation. Its main feature is the monument to the independence heroes of August 10, 1809, date remembered as the First Cry of Independence of the Royal Audience of Quito from Spanish monarchy. The environment of the square is flanked by the Carondelet Palace, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace and the Plaza Grande Hotel.\nChurch of San Fransisco.\nChurch and Monastery of St. Francis, colloquially known as El San Francisco, is a colonial-styled church and monastery located in Quito, Ecuador. Construction of the building began a few weeks after the founding of the city in 1534 and ended in 1604. The founder of the church was Franciscan missionary Jodoco Ricke.\nThe building's construction began around 1550, sixteen years after Quito was founded by Spanish conquistadors, and was finished in approximately 1680. The building was officially inaugurated in 1605. It is not known who designed the original plans for the complex, though the most-accepted theory is that they were sent from Spain, based on the topographical study of Ricke and Gosseal. It is also possible that architects came from Spain for the construction of the monastery, or that Ricke and Gosseal managed the entire construction.\nChurch of El Sagrario.\nIn colonial times, the Church of El Sagrario was one of the largest architectural marvels of Quito. The construction is of the Italian Renaissance style and was built in the late 17th century. It has a screen that supports its sculptures and decorations. This structure was built by Bernardo de Legarda. Its central arch leads to a dome decorated with frescoes of biblical scenes featuring archangels, work by Francisco Alb\u00e1n. The altarpiece was gilded by Legarda. It is located on Calle Garc\u00eda Moreno, near the Cathedral.\nChurch of Santo Domingo.\nAlthough they arrived in Quito in 1541, in 1580 the Dominicans started to build their temple, using the plans and direction of Francisco Becerra. The work was completed in the first half of the 17th century. Inside the church are valuable structures, such as the neo-Gothic main altar. This was placed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mud\u00e9jar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is composed of a pair and knuckle frame, coated inside by pieces of tracery. In the museum located on the north side of the lower cloister are wonderful pieces of great Quito sculptors such as the Saint Dominic de Guzm\u00e1n by Father Carlos, the Saint John of God by Caspicara, and the Saint Thomas Aquinas by Legarda. Another Baroque piece that stands is the Chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario, which is a recognizable feature of the architecture of Quito. This chapel was built beside the church, in the gospel side. In this was founded the largest fraternity in the city of Quito.\nEl Panecillo.\nEl Panecillo is a hill located in the middle west of the city at an altitude of about 3,016 metres (9,895\u00a0ft) above sea level. A monument to the Virgin Mary is located on top of El Panecillo and is visible from most of the city of Quito. In 1976, the Spanish artist Agust\u00edn de la Herr\u00e1n Matorras was commissioned by the religious order of the Oblates to build a 41 metres (135\u00a0ft)\u2013tall aluminum monument of a madonna, which was assembled on a high pedestal on the top of Panecillo.\nThe Quito School.\nThe Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest Jodoco Ricke, who together with Friar Pedro Gocial transformed the San Andr\u00e9s seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of miscegenation (\"mestizaje\") and of syncretism, in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.\nThe Quito School (\"Escuela Quite\u00f1a\") is an artistic tradition that developed in the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito, from Pasto and Popay\u00e1n in the north to Piura and Cajamarca in the south, during the colonial period (1542-1824). This artistic production was one of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito.\nThe major artists of the Quito School are the sculptors Bernardo de Legarda , Manuel Chili (Caspicara) and Miguel Angel Tejada Zambrado and the painters Fray Pedro Gosseal, Fray Pedro Bed\u00f3n, Nicol\u00e1s Javier Gor\u00edbar, Hernando de la Cruz, Miguel de Santiago, Manuel de Samaniego\nBasilica del Voto Nacional.\nThe Basilica of the National Vow is a Roman Catholic church in the historic center of Quito. It is sometimes also called the Catedral Consagraci\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas or the Bas\u00edlica de San Juan. It is the largest neo-Gothic basilica in the Americas.\nThe basilica arose from the idea, proposed by father Julio Matovelle in 1883, of building a monument as a perpetual reminder of the consecration of Ecuador to the Sacred Heart, President Luis Cordero issued the decree on July 23, 1883, and it was carried out by president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pl\u00e1cido Caama\u00f1o on March 5, 1884. The congress, in accordance with the year's budget, designated 12,000 pesos for the construction - 1,000 pesos per month, beginning in 1884. By the decree of July 3, 1885, the fourth Quitense Provincial Council turned the construction of the basilica into a religious commitment in the name of the country. The basilica remains technically \"unfinished.\" &amp; local legend says that when the Bas\u00edlica is completed, the end of the world will come.\nMetropolitan Cathedral.\nConstruction began in 1562, seventeen years after the diocese of Quito was created (1545) and located in the heart of the historic city and its status as the main church of the city, is one of the largest religious symbols of spiritual value for the Catholic community in the city.\nChurch of San Agust\u00edn.\nIt is one of the seven monumental churches of the 16th and 17th centuries whose main portico was built on stone in the Spanish Baroque-architecture style.\nThe church includes a small atrium (decorated by a large stone cross), an inside yard with a large garden and a large session hall where the frayers held dissertations or \"capitulations\" of faith.\nThe cloister and convent have a separate entrance which leads to the garden. The bell tower reaches a high of twenty-two meters (seventy feet) and houses two bronze bells of the period.\nGu\u00e1pulo, Quito.\nGu\u00e1pulo is a district of Quito, Ecuador, also called an electoral parish (\"parroquia electoral urbana\"). The parish was established as a result of the October 2004 political elections when the city was divided into 19 urban electoral parishes. Set behind Hotel Quito, the neighborhood of Gu\u00e1pulo runs down the winding Camino de Orellana, from Gonz\u00e1lez Su\u00e1rez to Calle de los Conquistadores, the main road out of Quito and to the neighboring suburbs.\n Often considered an artsy, bohemian neighborhood of Quito, Gu\u00e1pulo is home to many local artists and a couple of hippy caf\u00e9s/bars. Every year on September 7 the guapule\u00f1os honor their neighborhood with the Fiestas de Gu\u00e1pulo, a fantastic celebration complete with costumes, parade, food, drink, song, dance, and fireworks.\nGu\u00e1pulo Park is a 19.5 hectares, 48 acre public park. The park is administered by the Public Sector under the Parks and Public Spaces Urban Spaces that is under the National Plan for Good Living as to the creation of green spaces for cultural practices, recreational and sports activities."}

Its name is spelt Siena in Italian. The city has a population of about 54,000.\nThe historic centre of Siena has been declared by UNESCO a World Heritage Site. It is one of the nation's most visited tourist attractions, with over 163,000 international arrivals in 2008. Siena is famous for its cuisine, art, museums, medieval cityscape and the Palio, a horse race held twice yearly.\nSiena began as Etruscan, before it was conquered by Ancient Rome. Sienna prospered under the Lombards, who became the first Kings of Italy. Lombard nobles governed it until the 8th century, when they were conquered by Charlemagne and his Franks. Feudal rule eded with the death of the Countess Matilda in 1115, and Sienna became an independent city with its own government. There were struggles between Siena and Florence during the Middle Ages and the renaissance. The city did well in wool and money lending or usury, the charging of interest on loans.\nHistory.\n- 900 to 400 BC: Sienna, like other Tuscan hill towns were occuped by Etruscans that changed the territories with their technology of irrigation.\n- 390 Battle of the Allia\n- At the time of the Emperor Augustus, a Roman town called \"Saena Julia \" in the territories previously occupied by Etruscans.\n- Siena did not prosper under Roman rule. It was not sited near any major roads and therefore missed out on the resulting opportunities for trade.\n- 774 BC: the oldest aristocratic families in Sienna date their line to the Lombards' surrender to Charlemagne.\n- 1115: the death of Countess Matilda, an important point for the history of Sienna, because after this the Mark of Tuscia which had been under the control of her family \u2013 the Canossa \u2013 broke up into several autonomous regions.\n- Sienna became a major center of money lending and an important for trade. It was governed at first directly by its Bishop.\n- During the 1100s: power of Bishop lost energy and at the same thime the biggest build of Sienna, the Duomo, was completed.\n- 1167: Sienna, after a trouble about territories with Arezzo, became independence from the Bishop.\n- 1179: Sienna had a written constitution.\n- Early 12th century a self-governing commune replaced the earlier aristocratic government. The consuls who governed the republic slowly became more inclusive of the \"poblani\", or common people, and the Commune increased its territory as the surrounding feudal nobles in their fortified castles submitted to the urban power. Sienna's republic, struggling internally between nobles and the popular party, usually worked in political opposition to its great rival, Florence.\n- 1203: Siena's university was founded.\n- 4 September 1260: the Senese Ghibellines, supported by the forces of King Manfred of Sicily, defeated the Florentine Guelphs in the Battle of Montaperti.\n-1348: Sienna was devastated by the Black Death.\n- 1355: with Charles IV of Luxembourg in the city, the population rose and suppressed the government of the \"Nove\" (Nine), establishing that \"Dodici\" (Twelve) nobles assisted by a group with a popular majority.\n- Years later gave the power Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan in order to defend it from the Florentine attacks.\n- 1404: the Visconti were expelled and a government of Ten Priors established, in alliance with Florence against King Ladislas of Naples. With the election of the Sienese Pius II as Pope, the Piccolomini and other noble families were helped to return to the government, but after his death the control returned into popular hands.\n- 1472: the Republic founded the Monte dei Paschi, a bank that is still active today and is the oldest surviving bank in the world.\n- 1487: The noble legacy returned in the city under Pandolfo Petrucci with the support of Florence and of Alfonso of Calabria;\n- Pandolfo was succeeded by his son Borghese, who was ousted by his cousin Raffaello, helped by the Medici Pope Leo X. The last Petrucci was Fabio, exiled in 1523 by the Sienese people.\n- Emperor Charles V took advantage of the chaotic situation to put a Spanish garrison in Sienna. The citizens expelled the garrison in 1552, and made allies with France. This was unacceptable for Charles, who sent his general Gian Giacomo Medici to lay siege to it with a Florentine-Imperial army.\n- August 1554: Sienna lost against Florence at the Battle of Marciano. After 18 months of resistance, it surrendered to Florence on 17 April 1555, marking the end of the Republic of Siena. The new Spanish King Philip, owing huge sums to the Medici, gave it (apart from some coastal fortresses) to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany,\n- Until the unification of Italy Sienna was controlled by Florence.\nThe city is an important centre for art and culture.\nSports.\nSiena has enjoyed a long tradition in sports. Basketball and football are popular in Siena.

In some countries it is important who did the bad act. This may have an effect on decisions about the money and property of the two people. Normally a divorce comes in force some time after the decision of approval.\nDivorce with no bad doing.\nUnder this system, divorce is possible with no argument about a bad act by one of the married people. In some countries it is enough to make a statement that the relation is broken and it is not possible for it to be fixed. This is true in the United States for example. It is not necessary to say that one of the married people was responsible. The system lets two married people make a request together or only one.\nDivorce with facts in support of a bad deed by one person.\nIn most systems of law it is necessary to give facts about a bad act by one married person to get a divorce. The person may give arguments against the decision. Examples of this sort of reason for a divorce are:\nDifferent ways of getting a divorce.\nQuick divorce.\nIn some systems it is possible to get a quick divorce with simple rules. The important questions then are:\nDivorce with no argument.\nAbout 95% of divorces in the United States are without argument because the two people are able to come to an agreement about the property, their sons and daughters, and other questions. The agreement may be made with the help of lawyers (experts on laws).\nIn some countries, there are special systems which give help to people. For example, they are able to go a hearing with a judge but no lawyers. Lawyers may have discussions with the people to make an agreement. In some systems, an expert with experience of divorces makes decisions in place of a judge.\nIn Russia two people are able to get a divorce in the office where the government keeps records of births marriages and deaths. One person or the two married persons make the request and it will be given if:\nThen, the office will give knowledge of the request to the other person. After this time, the other person has one month to make an argument in writing against the request. Then the office will put a stop to the request.\nImpacts.\nA divorce can be very stressful; some people become depressed or sad after a divorce. If there are children, the children may also feel sad when the parents are divorced. However, there are many resources that can help people who are divorcing, such as therapists, counsellors, books, and DVDs.\nThe biggest impact is always felt the children who are often force to grow up with only one parent. This reaches its climax when the one parent taking care of the child is forced to work all day and doesn't have time for the child. Children who have broken homes are twice as likely to drop out of high school dropout\nIf the parents remarry, the children of their new husband or wife are their stepchildren. \"Step-\" can be put before any relation to show it is from another marriage. If there are children in the new marriage, children from a former marriage are called half-brothers or half-sisters, since they are \"half\" related.\nPeople who are trapped in abusive relationships might divorce as a way of help.\nDivorce in different cultures.\nThe law of divorce is different in every country. Only two countries do not allow divorce, the Philippines and the Vatican. In the Philippines, only Muslims, are allowed to divorce, and the Vatican is the only country with no law of divorce. In the Philippines and the Vatican, married people are not able to end their relation, but it is possible for them to say they were never married for example, because of an error. Most religions do not agree with the couples divorcing. Divorce in Australia follows the no-fault principle, which was established by the Family Law Act 1975. This means that the court does not need to know the reason for the divorce, just that the marriage has broken down irretrievably."}

For example, caribou in the Arctic go south in winter and return in summer when it is warmer. Many birds migrate, such as geese and storks.\nMigration is the travelling of long distances in search of a new habitat. The trigger for the migration may be local climate, local availability of food, or the season of the year. To be counted as a true migration, and not just a local dispersal, the movement should be an annual or seasonal event.\nMany birds fly to warmer places for the winter, as do some insects such as the migratory locust. Young Atlantic salmon leave the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches (cm) in size.\nMany species in the sea have a daily migration. Plankton go up for the day where there is light, and down at night, where they are less easy to find. The many species which feed on them follow them up and down.\nMigration is an evolutionary force. This is because it is a major source of natural selection. The success of migratory animals to make the journey is usually needed for them to reproduce.\nMany parts of the world have a strongly seasonal climate. In order to survive, many species need to breed in one place and, later, eat in another place. The simplest example is the African herbivores, who follow the growth of grass in East Africa. This region has seasonal rainfall, and so it has seasonal growth of grass. Their predators follow them.\nBird migration.\nBird migration is the regular seasonal movement, usually north and south along a 'flyway', between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Many birds die when they are migrating, and is mainly to get food. It occurs mostly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Arctic tern holds the long-distance migration record for birds. It flies between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year. Albatrosses circle the earth, flying over the southern oceans. The Manx shearwater migrates between its northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including altitudinal migrations up and down mountains like the Andes and Himalayas.\nHuge distances.\nSince the distance that some birds travel on migration can be enormous, why such huge distances? Migration is useful for the birds, because the seasonal differences are to the birds' advantage. So far as is known, migration instincts are inherited: the birds cannot make a personal choice in the matter. All the same, in some species not all migrate. There is a cost to migration in the number of birds which die \"en route\". There is an advantage only if the birds which migrate have a better chance of leaving descendants. Studies of migration have been done since the 18th century. There is still much we do not know about it.\nHistorically, bird migration would have started when the continents were close together. It might have started in the Upper Cretaceous or the Palaeocene. Then. as the continents drifted apart, the bird migrations got longer and longer. That makes sense, but there is no direct evidence available."}

Original sin is considered to be the result of the story of Adam and Eve in The Bible. In that story (Genesis 3), God only made one rule for them: They must not eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. But the snake told Eve, that eating the fruit would make Eve like God. Eve then persuaded Adam to eat the fruit. After they had broken God's only rule, they were removed from the Garden of Eden.\nThen Genesis tells the story of how their oldest son Cain killed his brother Abel. Based mostly on this and many other stories and passages in the Bible and Saint Paul's statement in Romans 5:12 (Sin entered the world because one man, Adam, sinned, and death came because of sin. Everyone sinned, so death came to all people.--NIV), Christians traditionally believe that no human is without sin. \nMore specifically the term \"original sin\" refers to the state of being part of the human race. This was first explained fully by Saint Augustine in his writings against the Pelagians. The Eastern Orthodox Churches do not believe in this specific doctrine of Original Sin."}

At first, he was a professor at the University of Basel. He worked in a part of classical studies called classical philology. He later wrote several books of philosophy. And is now known as one of the most important thinkers of modern times.\nBeliefs.\nNietzsche wrote a lot about how people make decisions and about how they live their lives. He attacked most of the moral ideas that were popular at the time because he did not believe that there are any real facts about what is right or wrong. He thought people should create their own facts about morality.\nHe also often attacked the ideas of the Christian religion - he believed that the Christian idea that one should feel pity when one sees weakness was unhelpful. According to him, weak people rely on other people's love as a way of protecting themselves. Nietzsche believed that people should be stronger than that.\nHe thought that people should be very aware of their body and of the real world in which they actually live. He told his readers not to live in a daydream or make decisions based on unrealistic thoughts. He believed that ideas of heaven came from an inability to cope with life in the world.\nNietzsche considered the world to be one connected thing, including mankind and nature. He invented the idea of the \"will to power\". This idea is that everyone and everything is trying to overcome itself, or defeat or take control from itself. Therefore, if the world is just one thing, this is the force that makes the world.\nNietzsche thought that human beings would be successful at overcoming themselves, and he thought that when they did, they would be different and better. He named the person who would do this someday a \"superman\" (or \"\u00dcbermensch\" in German). He thought that the supermen would be stronger than normal humans, and not restricted by other people's ideas of right and wrong.\nInfluence.\nAdolf Hitler, the German Chancellor and leader of the Nazis in World War II, read Nietzsche's work. Some people say that Hitler did not understand Nietzsche's ideas, but he used them to try to show that his actions were right. Hitler and Benito Mussolini used the term \"\u00dcbermensch\" to refer to the Aryan race. However he was not popular among all fascists.\nNietzsche wrote in a very fiery and exciting way. However, what he wrote later in his life became more and more odd. When he was forty years old, Nietzsche went insane. Supposedly, one day in the city of Turin, Italy, he saw a horse being whipped by its owner and ran to save it, hugging it around the throat. After this, Nietzsche never wrote again and could not look after himself. This illness may have been caused by the disease syphillis, or a brain tumour.\nHis writing and ideas are still popular and of interest to academics and intellectuals.\nIn the late 1880s Georg Brandes developed a philosophy called \"aristocratic radicalism\" inspired by Nietzsche's idea of the \"overman.\" \nNietzsche is associated with anarchism, but his writing seems to have a negative opinion of anarchists. Anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman was deeply influenced by his work."}

The band came together in Los Angeles in 1981 and helped to invent the thrash sub-genre of heavy metal. They are well known for many of their songs, including \"Master of Puppets\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"One\", \"Enter Sandman\", and \"Nothing Else Matters.\" Since then, they have become one of metal's most popular and successful bands, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. The band's fifth album, Metallica, has sold over 125 million copies, making it the twenty-fifth biggest selling album of all time in America.\nBand history.\nThe band formed after drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a newspaper saying that he was looking for musicians to play material consisting of Tygers of Pang Tang, Diamond Head, and Led Zeppelin with. James Hetfield, a guitar player who would become the lead singer of Metallica, answered the advertisement. Later, Lars and James would have contact from another young aspiring guitar player seeking a band, Dave Mustaine. Ulrich, Hetfield, Mustaine, and bass player Ron McGovney began playing in the band. Ulrich and Hetfield saw another bass player, Cliff Burton, playing at a concert, and asked him to join the band to replace McGovney, who was having trouble getting along with other band members. Burton later joined the band after Ulrich and Hetfield agreed to move from Los Angeles to San Francisco. In 1983, Mustaine was kicked out of the band for his drug and alcohol problems and violent behavior, and was replaced with guitar player Kirk Hammett who left his previous band, Exodus. Mustaine went on to form his own band Megadeth, who became extremely popular on the metal scene, and have become one of Metallica's metal contemporaries, along with Slayer and Anthrax. All four bands are collectively known as the Big 4 of thrash metal.\nIn 1983, Metallica released their first studio album \"Kill 'Em All\", on which few of the songs were still credited to Mustaine. One year later, Metallica released their second studio album \"Ride the Lightning\". \"Ride the Lightning\" and \"The Call of Ktulu,\" the album's final track, were the band's last songs to give Dave Mustaine writing credits. Metallica was one of few bands at the time to deviate from the then popular hair/glam metal trend that was taking place during the 1980s, led by bands like Poison and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.\nIn 1986, Metallica released their third studio album, \"Master of Puppets\", which is widely considered to be one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. On September 27, 1986, Cliff Burton was killed when the band's tour bus crashed in Sweden. Burton was subsequently replaced by Jason Newsted after auditioning.\nWith Newsted as bassist, Metallica released their fourth studio album \"...And Justice for All\", reaching #6 on the \"Billboard 200\". The album features the song \"One,\" which won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1990. The album is criticized for its production and inaudible bass guitar, which is commonly believed to be a result of Jason Newsted's hazing, during which the other members turned down the bass guitar volume on the album. The album is also known for having much more complex song structures than previous albums.\nMetallica reached even greater success with their self-titled fifth studio album, which debuted at #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and has sold over 15 million copies in the United States. The album won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1992, being Metallica's third consecutive Grammy (the second being their cover of Queen's \"Stone Cold Crazy\").\nPyrotechnic accident.\nOn August 8, 1992 when the band were playing in Montreal, James Hetfield accidentally walked directly into a 12ft high pyrotechnic blast, sustaining second and third degree burns. Fortunately, he recovered and was performing with the band again seventeen days after the accident.\nMetallica's music shifted towards a more mainstream hard rock style, and continued their success with Load and ReLoad, released in 1996 and 1997, which both debuted at #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Despite the albums' success, many fans were unhappy with the large change of style from Metallica's previous albums.\nIn 1998, Metallica released Garage, Inc., which was an album of cover songs by many of the artists that influenced Metallica, such as Mot\u00f6rhead, Mercyful Fate, Thin Lizzy, and Blue \u00d6yster Cult.\nIn 2001, Newsted left Metallica to start his own project, , much against the band's wishes, particularly James Hetfield. Their eighth studio album, \"St. Anger\", was released in 2003, with producer playing bass after Newsted's departure. \"St. Anger\" also debuted at #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, but was even further disliked by fans than Load and Reload. Shortly after the release of \"St. Anger\", bassist Robert Trujillo joined the band after a long auditioning process with many bassists. At Trujillo's request, his audition song was Battery, a very fast-paced song from \"Master of Puppets\".\n\"Death Magnetic\", the band's ninth studio album, was released in September 2008, and debuted at #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, making Metallica the first band to achieve five consecutive #1 albums in United States. \"Death Magnetic\" showed a return to the band's thrash metal roots. From 2008 to 2010, Metallica performed their supporting the album's release. The tour concluded in Melbourne, Australia November 21, 2010.\nIn June 2010, Metallica attended the Sonisphere Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria with the rest of the Big 4, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer. Between Metallica's encores, all four bands took the stage to perform \"Am I Evil?\" by .\nIn 2011, \"Lulu\", a collaboration album between Metallica and Lou Reed, was released. Many Metallica fans were dissatisfied due to stylistic differences between Reed and Metallica, but the album has managed to garner success.\nIn October 2013, Hetfield stated in an interview that the band would start working on their next album in early 2014.\nBand members.\nTimeline"}

{"id": "33724", "revid": "1144690", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33724", "title": "Babylon", "text": "Babylon was a city-state of ancient Mesopotamia, in present-day Iraq, about 85 kilometers (55\u00a0mi) south of Baghdad. All that remains of the original ancient city of Babylon today is a mound of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\nBabylon was at first a small town which sprung up at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BCE. The town flourished and became well-known and important. Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the 'holy city' of Mesopotamia. This was about from 612 to 539 BCE. It was the time Hammurabi first unified the Babylonian Empire. Babylon became the capital city of the Neo-Babylonian Empire .\nThe Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\nAssyrian period.\nDuring the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, It was only pacified by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689 BCE, its walls, temples and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the river on the south side of the city. This act shocked the religious conscience of Mesopotamia. After the murder of Sennacherib by two of his sons, his successor Esarhaddon hurried to rebuild the old city. He was crowned there, and it was where he lived for part of the year.\nIn the later overthrow of the Assyrian Empire, the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.\nNeo-Babylonian Chaldean Empire.\nBabylon threw off the Assyrian rule in 612 BCE and became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Chaldean Empire.\nWith the recovery of Babylonian independence, a new era of building followed, and Nebuchadnezzar II (604\u2013561 BCE) made Babylon into one of the wonders of the ancient world. Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds, including rebuilding the Etemenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate \u2014 the most spectacular of eight gates that ringed the perimeter of Babylon. All that was ever found of the Original Ishtar gate was the foundation and scattered bricks.\nNebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon (one of the seven wonders of the ancient world), said to have been built for his homesick wife Amyitis. Whether the gardens did exist is a matter of dispute. Historians disagree about the location, and some believe it may have been confused with gardens in Nineveh.\nPersia captures Babylon.\nIn 539 BCE, the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great, the king of Persia, in the Battle of Opis. The walls of Babylon were very high and very thick. The only way into the city was through one of its many gates. The Euphrates flowed next to the walls and Cyrus decided to use the river to get into the city. Cyrus' troops diverted the Euphrates river. This caused the level of the river to drop allowing soldiers to enter the city.\nThe Babylonians had held a celebration that evening. The Persian Army took over most of the city before the Babylonians had become aware that the Persians had gotten into the city. The account was reported by Herodotus, and is also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. Cyrus claimed the city by walking through the gates of Babylon with little or no resistance from the drunken Babylonians.\nCyrus later issued a decree allowing people, including the Jews, to return to their own land. This is mentioned in the Old Testament. It allowed Jews' temple to be rebuilt in Jerusalem.\nUnder Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius the Great, Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy (Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north). It was a centre of learning and scientific advancement. In Achaemenid Persia, the Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalised. Babylonian scholars made maps of constellations. The city was the administrative capital of the Persian Empire. This empire was the most powerful of the then known world. Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that improve our understanding of that era.\nThe early Persian kings had tried to keep the religious ceremonies of Marduk. By the reign of Darius III, over-taxation and numerous wars had led to a deterioration of Babylon's main shrines and canals, and the disintegration of the region. Despite three rebellions in 522 BCE, 521 BCE and 482 BCE, the land and city of Babylon remained under Persian rule for two centuries. In 331 BCE, Alexander the Great took over. Under the Parthian Empire, Babylon continued to shrink and lose importance."}

It is the changing of an organism's genome using biotechnology. These methods are recent discoveries. The techniques are advanced, and full details are not given here.\nThis is an overview of what can be done: \nAn organism that is altered by genetic engineering is a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMOs were bacteria in 1973; GM mice were made in 1974. Insulin-producing bacteria were commercialized in 1982. Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, including crops.\nGenetic engineering techniques have been used in research, agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine. Enzymes used in laundry detergent, and medicines such as insulin and human growth hormone are now manufactured in GM cells. GM animals such as mice or zebrafish are being used for research purposes.\nCritics have objected to use of genetic engineering on several grounds, including ethical concerns, ecological concerns. Economic concerns are raised by the fact GM techniques and GM organisms are subject to intellectual property law. Ecological concerns are more subtle. There is a risk that some genetically modified (\"GM\") organisms may be better adapted to some niche in nature, and will take away some the habitat of the regular species.\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was won in 2012 by John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for \"the discovery that \"mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent\". The Nobel Prize for \n2020 was won by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna for \"the development of a method for genome editing\". Together, these awards show how close we are to the practical use of genetic changes which could fix many medical problems.\nSynthetic genomics.\nThe ability to construct long base pair chains cheaply and accurately on a large scale allows researchers to do experiments on genomes that do not exist in nature. The field of 'synthetic genomics' is beginning to enter a productive stage.\nGM food.\nGMOs (genetically modified organisms) are involved in controversies over GM food. Is the food produced from GM crops is safe? Should it be labeled, and are GM crops needed to address the world's food needs? These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in most countries.\nWe can now produce and use GM and GE seeds. Some large countries like India and China have already decided that GM farming is what they need to feed their populations. Other countries are still debating the issue. This debate involves scientists, farmers, politicians, companies and UN agencies. Even those involved in the production of GM seedlings are not in total agreement."}

He died of a heart attack on July 8, 1994. The North Korean government gave him the title of \"Eternal President\" after his death.\nKim Il Sung created the Juche political idea. He ran North Korea differently than the Soviet Union and China.\nWhen he died, his son Kim Jong Il (1941-2011) became the leader of North Korea. He had that job until he died on December 17, 2011. His grandson, Kim Jong Un (born 1983) is the leader of North Korea. His brother, Kim Yong Ju (born 1920), was also a government official.\nKim Il Sung's name means \"one who becomes the sun\".\nThere are more than 300 statues of Kim Il Sung in North Korea.\nFounding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nIn 1945, after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, the United States bombed Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, severely weakening the Japanese Empire. The Soviet Red Army entered Japanese-Korea and captured Pyongyang with little difficulty. They made Kim Il Sung the leader of the North Korean branch of the Korean Communist Party and supplied him with modern Soviet tanks, trucks, arms and artillery for the Korean People's Army (KPA). The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was declared on September 8, 1948 despite UN resistance. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin installed Kim as leader of the new state. The southern portion of the Korean Peninsula declared itself the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in retaliation. Statues of Kim appeared in North Korea as early as 1949.\nKorean War.\nThe Soviet Union recognized Kim's regime as having sovereignty over the whole Korea, including the south. It is generally accepted that Kim invaded the south by his own decision and that the Soviets did not influence him. The south was caught completely by surprise when Kim's army invade in the early morning of June 25, 1950. The KPA captured Seoul and most of the south apart from Pusan in the south-east. UN forces backed mostly by the United States landed in Korea and began to push the KPA back north. Firstly, the UN forces managed to push the KPA back behind the 38th parallel (the imaginary line that divided the Koreas during the war). The newly formed People's Republic of China was at first reluctant to the idea that the Koreas would be reunited under Kim's regime but accepted when Kim told them that Stalin approved the invasion.\nIt was put to a UN vote on whether UN forces should attempt to gain control of Korea under democratic rule. The motion was passed since the Soviet Union was not present during the vote. Had the Soviets vetoed the proposal, the UN forces would not have been able to press further into Korea. Eventually UN forces captured Pyongyang and Kim's government was forced to flee north over the Yalu River into China. The Chinese army mobilized and eventually crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the KPA and Red Army against US, British and UN forces. Eventually they reached a stalemate since neither force could gain full sovereignty of the peninsula. An armistice was signed on July 27, 1953 ending three years of fighting and established the two sovereign nations of North Korea and South Korea. Since no peace treaty was signed, the two Koreas are technically still in a state of war with each other.\nLeader of North Korea.\nDuring the early years, North Korea was ahead of its southern neighbor economically; most likely due to Soviet and Chinese aid. Kim installed a centrally-planned Soviet-style command economy. The means of production was controlled by the government and food prices were fixed instead of being allowed to rise and fall like in a market system. Kim Il Sung formally became leader of North Korea with the establishment of the constitution of the DPRK in 1972 which identified him as President of the republic.\nCult of personality.\nTo coincide with Kim Il Sung's seventieth birthday in 1982, a 170m tall tower called the \"Juche Tower\" was built. It was made up from 25,550 stone blocks; one for each day of Kim's life.\nIt is a legal requirement to have a portrait of him, alongside his son Kim Jong Il, hanging in one's home. Everyone is issued a special cloth to dust and clean the portraits.\nIn the 1980s a calcium deposit developed on the back of Kim Il Sung's neck. It swelled up to the size of an orange at its greatest extent. It was quickly determined that an operation to remove it was not possible due to its close proximity to his spine. North Korean reporters were thereafter forbidden to photograph Kim Il Sung from the right.\nIn 1997 with Kim Jong Il fully consolidating his power after the death of his father, North Korea abandoned the Gregorian calendar that is used in the rest of the world. Instead they use the \"Juche\" calendar which starts from the year of Kim Il Sung's birth (1912) as being year 1. For example, 2015 would be written as \"Juche\" 104. To calculate the date in Juche years, simply subtract 1911 from the current year. Dates are often written in North Korea with \"Juche\" first; for example: April 12, \"Juche\" 104 (2015).\nLater rule.\nIn the early 1990s, North Korea began to experience a famine, labelled as the \"'Great Famine\"'. At the same time the Soviet Union was going through serious economic and social changes as well as suffering a stagnating economy. The Soviets, who had supplied the DPRK with food amongst other things since the late 1940s, began to demand the North Koreans to pay them back; money that the DPRK did not posses. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and food aid stopped almost immediately. Kim Il Sung's centrally planned economic system, where the government plans the economic output in advance, proved to be too inflexible to avoid the economic disaster. On the 8th of July 1994, Kim Il Sung had a heart attack and died shortly afterwards, leaving his country severely bankrupt, malnourished and isolated.\nA mourning period was declared after he died and did not officially end until 1997; three years after death. His son, the long-groomed successor, Kim Jong Il succeeded him as supreme leader of North Korea. Kim Jong Il did not become President since Il-Sung was given the honorary title of \"'Eternal President\"'. Instead he was named General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (leader of the ruling party). North Korea is therefore the world's only country that is technically led by a dead man.\nState propaganda portrayed Kim Il Sung as a god to the people and when he died many people felt lost, distressed and confused as many believed that he could not die.\nResistance to Japan.\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Korea, Kim Il Sung was involved with numerous opposition guerrilla groups."}

It is also the capital of Riyadh Province, and belongs to the historical regions of Nejd and Al-Yamama. It is in the center of the Arabian Peninsula on a large plateau, and is home to 6.5 million people.\nThe city is divided into 15 municipal districts, managed by Riyadh Municipality headed by the mayor of Riyadh, and the Riyadh Development Authority, chaired by the governor of Riyadh Province, Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud. The current mayor of Riyadh is Ibrahim Mohammed Al Sultan. He was appointed mayor in 2015. It has been designated a global city.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nDuring the Pre-Islamic era the city at the site was called \"Hajr\" (), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa. Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveller Ibn Battuta wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as \"the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr\". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to Mecca to perform the Hajj.\nGeography and climate.\nCity districts.\nRiyadh is divided into fifteen branch municipalities, in addition to the Diplomatic Quarter. Each branch municipality in turn contains several districts, amounting to over 130 in total, though some districts are divided between more than one branch municipality. The branch municipalities are Al-Shemaysi, Irqah, Al-Ma'athar, Al-Olayya, Al-Aziziyya, Al-Malaz, Al-Selayy, Nemar, Al-Neseem, Al-Shifa, Al-'Urayja, Al-Bat'ha, Al-Ha'ir, Al-Rawdha, and Al-Shimal (\"the North\"). Olaya District is the commercial heart of the city, with accommodation, entertainment, dining and shopping options. The Kingdom Center, Al Faisalyah and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks. The centre of the city, Al-Bathaa and Al-Dir'iyyah, is also its oldest part.\nClimate.\nClassified as having a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BWh\"), temperatures during the summer months are extremely hot. The average high temperature in August is 43.6\u00a0\u00b0C. Winters are warm with cool, windy nights. The overall climate is arid, and the city experiences very little rainfall, especially in summer, but receives a fair amount of rain in March and April. It is also known to have dust storms during which the dust can be so thick that visibility is under . On 1 and 2 April 2015, a massive dust storm hit Riyadh, causing suspension of classes in many schools in the area and cancellation of hundreds of flights, both domestic and international."}

People experience or learn popular culture by hearing popular music on the radio, watching television, playing video games, or reading popular books and magazines. Popular culture may affect all kinds of knowledge or thought, including art, religion, or language. \nPopular culture as a problem in society.\nPopular culture does not follow any one system of ideas, customs, philosophy, religion, or morality. Some of its forms include grammar, language, or pictures that are not accepted under a society's customs. For this reason a society or government may not approve of popular culture. If a government thinks that any form of it may harm people or cause society to change in a bad way, the government may ban it. This practice is known as censorship. In some countries popular culture is protected under freedom of speech or other rights. \nAmerican popular culture.\nThe United States is an industrialized country (see industrialization) in which citizens use mass media. Its government protects language and cultures under freedom of speech. The U.S. has had periods of popular culture since the 20th century. For instance, after World War II a group of children known as Baby boomers experienced a sudden expansion of popular culture."}

Usually people choose to be in a psychiatric hospital. Sometimes psychiatrists can put people in hospitals who do not want to be there, because they think the people are dangerous to themselves or other people. A halfway house or group home is a place for patients who have left the psychiatric hospital and are slowly being released into society.\nHistory.\nPsychiatric hospitals used to be called lunatic asylums. Earlier asylums like the old Bethlem Royal Hospital in London (nicknamed \"Bedlam\") were like prisons. Patients received no treatment and were often imprisoned and chained. In the 19th century, new asylums were built. These were designed to be pleasant places with gardens and airy rooms, and later became known as psychiatric hospitals. Although they no longer looked like prisons, patients still had little freedom or hope of leaving. The term institutionalisation means when someone has lived in a hospital (or some other place like a prison) for so long that they cannot cope with living outside of it.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, new drugs were invented that made it easier to treat mental illness. Governments began to look for ways to care for patients outside of hospitals. They believed it would lead to better care for patients and save money. This is known as deinstitutionalisation. Since the 1970s, many countries have closed large numbers of psychiatric hospitals. Mentally ill patients are now also cared for in local hospitals, small clinics and in their own homes."}

The programming language has been changed many times to do things in addition to changing text files. Some of these things are tasks like making web pages show information in a better way than before, or take information and show it in a way that makes more sense to people. Sometimes Perl code is written using many symbols besides letters and numbers, which can make those programs hard to read.\nUsage.\nA lot of web pages are written using Perl, but it can be used to do all kinds of things on computers. It is very good at searching through text looking for patterns, which lets people find words that they may be looking for, or also let people find words they are looking for, and change them with different words much more quickly than they would if they had to do it one word at a time.\nPerl is also a high-level programming language. A high-level language has advanced features which let the programmer tell the computer what to do without having to worry about how the computer is going to do it as compared to low-level programming languages which often require more programmer effort. \nPerl was invented by Larry Wall, and he is working on a new version of it.\nExample.\nAn example Hello World program in Perl:\nsay 'Hello World!'\nYou can use variables in Perl.\nA variable is a box where you can put items. In Perl, every variable starts with its own sigil. A sigil is the way to tell the Perl interpreter about what type of variable you are using. Variables can be scalar, array, hash, regular expression, typeglob or subroutine.\nFor example:\nmy $a_scalar = 2;\nmy $b = 5.29 ;\nmy $c = \"a string\";\nmy $d = 'another';\nmy @e = ($b,3,4,$c,$d);\nmy %f = ('a'=&gt;$b,'cad'=&gt;'pqr',$c=&gt;$d);\nPerl Packages.\nThe Perl Archive Network aka CPAN hosts a large number of extensions to Perl which may be downloaded for free."}

However, it turns out that it is impossible to tell if someone is a virgin by looking at their hymen. Studies have confirmed that all girls are born with hymens.\nTypes.\nThere are several different types of hymen. In about 1 in 2,000 females, the hymen does not develop at all. The hymen may also not have a hole in it; this is called an \"imperforate hymen\". In this case a hole will need to be surgically cut into it to allow menstrual fluid (period blood) out. \nOther types are:\nWhat might damage the hymen.\nWhen a girl reaches puberty, the hymen becomes stretchy.

The hymen comes from the skin covering the vagina at that time.\nIn young babies, the hymen is thick and pink. This is because the mother is giving the baby hormones through breast feeding which keeps it thick. In adolescent girls, the hymen becomes thin, smooth and delicate because she has stopped taking in hormones. The hymen becomes very sensitive and can easily cause pain if touched. From puberty, the hymen gets thicker again and becomes pale pink. This is because of the hormone estrogen."}

It is believed to be a part of the urethral sponge. Some people believe it is a bundle of nerves in the female human reproductive system. If the area is stimulated, this can cause pleasurable sensations, female ejaculation and a strong orgasm in some women. Some doctors and researchers who specialize in the anatomy of women say that there is no anatomical evidence for the spot.\nOrigin.\nThe \"G-spot\" concept was named by Addiego and others in 1981 or by Beverly Whipple and others in 1982. It is named after the German gynaecologist, Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg. Gr\u00e4fenberg wrote first about \"The Role of Urethra in Female Orgasm\" in 1950. A book was first published about the G-spot in 1982, called \"The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality\", by three authors from the United States: Alice Kahn Ladas, a psychologist; Beverly Whipple, a registered nurse and sex counselor; and John D. Perry, a psychologist.\nLocation.\nAlthough typically described as near the entrance inside of the vagina, reports of the G-spot's location vary and therefore it has no specific place to be found. However, there are two methods which are used to find it:\nSome women say that they have \"deeper\" orgasms when the G-spot is stimulated. One research team experimented with the vagina by trying to touch the G-spot in certain places under experimental conditions; they found that in most cases, women had a sensitive area near the front of the vagina.\nPublic views.\nSome people, including doctors, do not believe that the G-spot exists. When the book \"The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality\" was published in 1982, there was significant criticism. Some people who are not doctors simply say that it is a \"highly sensitive area\" in the vagina.\nScientific views.\nScientists have carried out tests trying to find the G-spot and have not found any consistent or definitive evidence of it, and most of them believe that, if it does exist, it is an extension of the clitoris."}

He had only about twelve thousand men with him but he had been promised help by Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Punjab. They planned to march together against the ruling Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, who was the King of Delhi at that time. When Babur reached India, the government was afraid to help him, and eventually backed out, and so Babur started off to Delhi by himself with his small army of men.\nIbrahim Lodi was reported to have one hundred thousand men and one hundred elephants. But Babur had something which Ibrahim did not have \u2013 heavy guns and cannons, the first proper Turkic style artillery seen in medieval India. There were hardly any guns at that time in India and Babur had managed to get hold of some in Kabul. He had cannons and some firearms as well.\nThe two armies met at the famous First battle of Panipat, at a small village near Delhi. Both armies remained in position opposite each other for a week before the battle began. Babur was an excellent general and he planned the battle very carefully as conquering Delhi was indeed very important to him. After the battle about fifteen thousand men of the enemy were killed including their commander Ibrahim Lodi. \nBefore the enemy could recover from their defeat, Delhi was captured.\nConsolidating victory.\nBabur had to fight more major battles, the battles of Khanua and Gogra. In 1527 A.D. he had to face a fierce enemy of his at Khanua, the Rajput hero, Rana Sangram (or Sanga)of Mewar. A ferocious battle was fought between the two in the field of Khanua and Babur won the battle. \nIn 1529 A.D., Babur got into a battle with the Afghans. Babur won, but the Afghans were not totally weakened. They joined hands with Mahmud Lodi, the brother of Ibrahim Lodi, to fight Babur again.

The land on one side of the line is controlled by India, and the land on the other side is controlled by Pakistan. It is not a legal international border, but is the effective boundary between the two countries. India and Pakistan fought over Kashmir between 1947 and 1948. The line originally marked the military front when the two countries declared a ceasefire on 1/2 January 1949. The fronts gradually became a solid boundary. It was formally named the Line of Control after the , which was signed on 3 July 1972.\nAll of Kashmir was previously the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu. The part of the region that is now under Indian control is known as the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The two parts that are under Pakistani control are known as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). The Line of Control is long.\nAnother cease-fire line separates the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir from the Chinese-controlled area of Aksai Chin. This is further to the east and is called the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Although the other side is controlled by India, China regards this line as part of its border with Pakistan. China and Pakistan have agreed on a border, but India has not.\nFencing.\nIndia has built a fence along its side of the Line of Control. It is currently long. It only runs part of the length of the line, the rest of the Line of Control is too inaccessible for construction of a barrier. Its stated purpose is to exclude arms smuggling and infiltration by Pakistani-based separatist militants. Pakistan has objected to the construction of the barrier, saying it violates both bilateral accords and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions on the region."}

Troops are changed every couple of weeks; they are either sent to the front line or a few miles back. At the beginning, Baumer and his fellow soldiers are very full and satisfied because a very heavy bombardment killed off half of the company.\nA number of soldiers and Baumer are injured one night, and all are taken to the local hospital. In there, when a nurse gives Baumer a temperature gauge, he uses a light and makes his temperature seem much higher than it really is. This is so he can go into critical care with his friends. While there, the nurses sing a hymn, which annoys the men. Baumer throws and breaks a bottle to make them shut the door.\nOne night, Baumer and his friends find two live pigs. They put together a feast. Baumer cooks some kind of cakes. They smoke cigarettes and drink coffee from the officer's dump and then roast the pigs. The meal is very good, but the pig meat sticks to their bowels and makes them go to the bathroom all night.\nAs the war draws to its end in 1918, the Germans are suffering. The food is bad and the men must keep going to the bathroom. The Americans have joined the war and are pushing back all of the ground that the Germans gained. During this time, many of Baumer's classmates die.\nAt the end of the novel, Baumer dies. The day was so quiet that the field commander described the day as \"all quiet on the Western Front.\"\nResponse.\nThe book sold 2.9 million copies in 50 languages in eighteen months. It is published by Ballantine Books in 1929. This book and its sequel, \"The Road Back\", were banned and burned in Nazi Germany. The film version won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1930."}

A 'mountain system' or 'system of mountain ranges' includes geological features that are in the same region as a mountain range.\nMountain ranges usually include highlands or mountain passes and valleys. Individual mountains in the same range do not always have the same geology or petrology. They may be a mix of different orogenic expressions and terrains, for example thrust sheets, uplifted blocks, fold mountains, and volcanic landforms. This results in a variety of rock types.\nMajor ranges.\nMost geologically young mountain ranges on the Earth's land surface are associated with either in the Pacific Ring of Fire or the Alpide Belt. The Pacific Ring of Fire includes the Andes of South America, extends through the North American Cordillera along the Pacific Coast, the Aleutian Range, on through Kamchatka, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, to New Zealand. The Andes is long and is often described as the world's longest mountain system.\nThe Alpide belt includes Indonesia and southeast Asia, through the Himalayas, and ends in the Alps. The belt also includes other European and Asian mountain ranges. The Himalayas contain the highest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest, at of elevation.\nMountain ranges outside of these two systems include the Arctic Cordillera, the world's northernmost mountain system. If the definition of a mountain range includes underwater mountains, then the ocean ridges form the longest continuous mountain system on Earth, with a length of .\nDivisions and categories.\nMany mountain ranges have sub-ranges within them. It can be thought of as a parent-child relationship. For example, the Appalachian Mountains range is the parent of its own ranges, two of which are the White Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains. The White Mountains are a child of the Appalachians, and there are also children of the Whites, like the Sandwich Range and the Presidential Range. \nClimate.\nThe position of mountains influences climate, such as rain or snow. When air masses move up and over mountains, the air cools producing precipitation (rain or snow). As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms again and is drier, having been stripped of much of its moisture. Often, a rain shadow will occur on the leeward side of a range.\nErosion.\nMountain ranges are always being eroded. Erosion is at work while the mountains are being uplifted and long after until the mountains are reduced to low hills and plains. The basins next to an eroding mountain range are filled with sediments which are buried and turned into sedimentary rock.\nThe early Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado are an example. As the uplift was occurring some of mostly Mesozoic sedimentary strata were removed by erosion and spread as sand and clays across the Great Plains to the east. This mass of rock was removed as the range was actively undergoing uplift."}

Microcode is on memory that is very fast to access. When a machine level instruction needs to be executed, microcode tells the processor what electronic circuits should be used. When a new processor is designed, an engineer also writes the microcode for the instructions of machine language. This is called Microprogramming, the resulting code is called a microprogram. \nIn early processors, each instruction was hard-wired. This has several drawbacks, the most obvious is that correcting an error in processor design means that the processor needs to be replaced. \nExample.\nA processor should add two values, which are in registers A and B.\nItems 1-3, as well as 5-6, can be coded as one instruction. It is also possible to hard-wire the logic needed for this operation. This has the benefit of being faster, but the drawback that it no longer allows changes that might be needed later on. \nThe concept of microprogramming was developed by Maurice Wilkes in 1951, using diode matrices for the memory element."}
{"id": "33955", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33955", "title": "Computational complexity theory", "text": "Computational complexity theory is a part of computer science. It looks at algorithms, and tries to say how many steps or how much memory a certain algorithm takes for a computer to do. Very often, algorithms that use fewer steps use more memory (or the other way round: if there is less memory available, it takes more steps to do). Many interesting algorithms take a number of steps that is dependent on the size of the problem.\nDifferent classes of complexity.\nConstant Complexity.\nComplexity theory also looks at how a problem changes if it is done for more elements. A problem of constant complexity class is the only class in which this is not true. A problem with constant complexity takes the same number of steps to complete no matter the size of the input or the number of elements it is computed on. Broadcasting a message can be thought of as a problem of constant complexity. No matter how many people need to receive a message, all can listen on to one single broadcast with no extra broadcasts needed. \nLinear complexity.\nMowing the lawn can be thought of as a problem with linear complexity. Mowing an area that is double the size of the original takes twice as long. \nQuadratic complexity.\nSuppose you want to know which of your friends know each other. You have to ask each pair of friends whether they know each other. If you have twice as many friends as someone else, you have to ask four times as many questions to figure out who everyone knows. Problems that take four times as long when the size of the problem doubles are said to have quadratic complexity.\nLogarithmic complexity.\nThis is often the complexity for problems that involve looking things up, like finding a word in a dictionary. If the dictionary is twice as big, it contains twice as many words as the original to compare to. Looking something up will take only one step more. The algorithm to do lookups is simple. The word in the middle of the dictionary will be either before or after the term that needs to be looked up, if the words do not match. If it is before, the term needs to be in the second half of the dictionary. If it is after the word, it needs to be in the first half. That way, the problem space is halved with every step, until the word or definition is found. This is generally known as logarithmic complexity\nExponential complexity.\nThere are problems that grow very fast. One such problem is known as the Travelling salesman problem. A salesman needs to take a tour of a certain number of cities. Each city should only be visited once, the distance (or cost) of the travelling should be minimal, and the salesman should end up where he started. This problem has exponential complexity. There are n factorial possibilities to consider. Adding one city (from n to n+1) will multiply the number of possibilities by (n+1). Most of the interesting problems have this complexity."}

In ordinary use, it means a series of events, one following another. In maths, a sequence is made up of several things put together, one after the other. The order that the things are in matters. For example, both (Blue, Red, Yellow) and (Yellow, Blue, Red) are sequences, but they are not the same. Sequences made up of numbers are also called progressions.\nThere are two kinds of sequences. One kind is finite sequences, which have an end. For example, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is a finite sequence. The other kind is infinite sequences, which means that they keep going and never end. An example of a sequence that is infinite is the sequence of all even numbers, bigger than 0. This sequence never ends: it starts with 2, 4, 6, and so on, and one can always keep on naming even numbers.\nIf a sequence is finite, it is easy to say what it is: one can simply write down all the things in the sequence. This does not work for an infinite sequence. So another way to write down a sequence is to write a rule for finding the thing in any place one wants. The rule should tell us how to get the thing in the \"n\"-th place, where \"n\" can be any natural number. This means that a sequence is really a special kind of function with natural numbers as its domain. We sometimes write a sequence as formula_1, where formula_2 stands for the \"n\"-th term of the sequence.\nFor example, the rule could be that the thing in the \"n\"-th place is the number 2\u00d7\"n\" (2 times n). This tells us what the whole sequence is, even though it never ends. The first number is 2\u00d71, which is 2. The second number is 2\u00d72, or 4. If we want to know what the 100-th number is, we can simply calculate 2\u00d7100 and get 200. No matter which thing in the sequence we want, the rule can tell us what it is.\nTypes of sequences.\nArithmetic progressions (AP).\nIn an arithmetic progression, the difference between a term and the term before it is always a constant.\nExample: formula_3\n9 - 4 = 5, 14 - 9 = 5, 19 - 14 = 5, 24 - 19 = 5, and so on. \nSo if one takes the first term as \"a\" and the constant difference as \"D\", then the general formula for arithmetic sequence is formula_4, where \"n\" is the number of term. \nGeometric progressions (GP).\nIn a geometric progression, the ratio between a term and the term before it is always constant. \nExample: formula_5\n6/3 = 2, 12/6 = 2, 24/12 = 2, 48/24 = 2, and so on. \nSo if one takes \"a\" to be the first term and \"r\" to be the ratio, then the general formula for geometric progression is formula_6, where \"n\" is the number of term. \nHarmonic Progressions (HP).\nIn a harmonic progression, the difference between the reciprocal of a term and the reciprocal of the term before it is a constant.\nExample: formula_7 \nformula_8, and so on.\nSeries.\nA series is the sum of all the terms of a sequence.\nThe general formula for calculating the sum of arithmetic sequence is \nformula_9\nThat of a geometric sequence is formula_10, if the sequence is infinite, andformula_11, if it is finite. \nHere, \"a\" is the first term, \"d\" is the common difference in arithmetic sequence, \"r\" is the ratio in geometric sequence and \"n\" is the number of term."}

{"id": "34046", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34046", "title": "Syphilis", "text": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium called \"Treponema pallidum\". Syphilis is usually spread by sexual contact. However, a fetus can get syphilis from its mother while she is pregnant or during childbirth. This is called \"congenital syphilis\".\nThere are four stages of syphilis: the primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. In each stage, the signs and symptoms of syphilis are different.\nIn the primary stage, a person usually just has a wound on their skin, called a \"chancre.\" In the secondary stage, a person usually gets a rash. In the \"latent\" stage, syphilis has few or no symptoms. If syphilis reaches the tertiary stage, which is the most severe, it causes many serious symptoms. These can include problems with the nervous system (the brain and nerves) and problems with the heart. Eventually, many people with tertiary syphilis will die if they do not get medical treatment.\nSyphilis is usually diagnosed with blood tests. The bacteria that causes syphilis can also be seen under a microscope. Most people who have syphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics.\nBy 1999, more than 12 million people around the world had gotten syphilis. More than 90% of these people (10.8 million) lived in the developing world. Syphilis got much less common after penicillin became available in the 1940s. At that time, penicillin was used as a treatment for syphilis, and often cured the disease. However, since 2000, syphilis is becoming more common again.\nSyphilis can be a very dangerous disease if it is not treated. Without treatment, 8% to 58% of people with syphilis die from the disease. Syphilis also makes a person two to five times more likely to get Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\nStages of syphilis.\nPrimary stage.\nAfter a person gets syphilis, the disease begins in the primary stage. A person gets syphilis by having sex with a person who has syphilis. Usually, the person who has syphilis has wounds on their genitals caused by syphilis. Touching these wounds during sex (including oral sex or anal sex) can give a person syphilis.\nLater, a chancre (skin sore) usually appears at the place on the body that touched the infected wounds. The chancre can be painful. The most common type of chancre gets bigger and bigger until it becomes an ulcer.\nChancres can appear in places other than the genitals. In women, chancres most often appear on the cervix - the bottom of the uterus. Some people get no chancres at all. Many people who have secondary syphilis (40\u201385% of women and 20\u201365% of men) say they never had a chancre during the primary stage.\nAround the place where syphilis entered the body, the lymph nodes usually get bigger about 7 to 10 days after the chancre forms. If the person does not get treatment, their wound(s) can last for three to six weeks.\nSecondary stage.\nIf a person does not get treatment, syphilis will get worse. The secondary stage of syphilis will start about four to ten weeks after the person first got infected. Secondary syphilis can cause many different symptoms. However, the most common three symptoms are:\nAll of the sores that people get during this stage can spread syphilis. The bacteria lives inside the wounds.\nThe symptoms of secondary syphilis usually get better after three to six weeks. However, in about 25% of cases (1 out of every 4), these symptoms can return. \nLatent stage.\nIn the latent stage of syphilis, a person has no symptoms, but blood tests show that he has syphilis. Latent syphilis is described as either early or late.\nTertiary stage.\nIf a person with syphilis does not get treatment, the disease can reach the worst stage - tertiary syphilis. Usually this happens about three to 15 years after the person first got infected. Without treatment, one-third of people with syphilis get tertiary disease. People with tertiary syphilis cannot infect other people with syphilis.\nThere are three different forms of tertiary syphilis.\nGummatous syphilis (late benign syphilis).\nGummatous syphilis can happen anywhere from one to 46\u00a0years after the person first got syphilis. On average, it happens after 15 years. It causes soft, tumor-like balls of inflammation (swelling), of many different sizes. Usually they appear on the skin, bone, and liver, but they can happen anywhere.\nAbout 15% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get gummatous syphilis.\nNeurosyphilis.\nIn neurosyphilis, the syphilis infects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In some people, neurosyphilis happens soon after they get syphilis. (This is called \"early neurosyphilis\".) Some of these people have no symptoms of neurosyphilis. Others get syphilitic meningitis, a dangerous infection of the meninges (the protective layers which line the brain and spinal cord).\nNeurosyphilis can also appear later, usually four to 25 years after a person first got syphilis. (This is called \"late neurosyphilis\".) Late neurosyphilis can cause many serious problems. For example: \nAbout 6.5% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get late neurosyphilis.\nCardiovascular syphilis.\nThis type of tertiary syphilis causes problems with the cardiovascular system (the heart and blood vessels). It usually happens 10 to 30\u00a0years after the person first got infected with syphilis.\nThe most common problem it causes is syphilitic aortitis, which affects the aorta. The aorta is the most important artery in the heart; it helps carry blood to the entire body. Syphilitic aortitis can make the aorta become too big. If the aorta is too big, it cannot work correctly.\nAbout 10% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get cardiovascular syphilis.\nCongenital syphilis.\nCongenital syphilis is spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy or childbirth.\nTwo out of every three infants born with syphilis have no symptoms. In the other infants, symptoms can appear as the baby gets older. The most common symptoms are:\nIf babies with syphilis do not get treated, they can get \"late congenital syphilis\", which has much more serious symptoms. For example, the child can have seizures, and their body and brain may not grow normally.\nCause.\nBacteria.\nSyphilis is caused by the \"Treponema pallidum\" bacterium. \"Treponema pallidum\" is a species of bacterium which is shaped like a spiral: a spirochaete. There are different types of \"Treponema pallidum\" bacteria, which are called subspecies.\nScientists think that \"Treponema pallidum\" can only live inside humans. The bacterium cannot survive outside a human for more than a few days.\nTransmission: how syphilis is spread.\nSyphilis is spread mostly by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus. Syphilis can pass through undamaged mucous membranes, or through damaged skin. Because of this, syphilis can be spread through oral sex, vaginal sex, and anal sex. It can also be spread by kissing, if the person with syphilis has a sore in their mouth.\nOnly a very small amount of the \"Treponema pallidum\" bacterium needs to get into a person's body to cause syphilis. However, not everybody who is exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease.\nA person can get syphilis if they get a blood transfusion from someone with the disease. However, many countries test blood donations for syphilis. In countries that do not do this, getting syphilis from a blood transfusion is much more likely.\nScientists think syphilis is usually not spread by sharing needles (using the same needles to inject drugs).\nA person cannot get syphilis from sitting on a toilet seat; using a hot tub or a swimming pool; sharing plates, cups, or utensils; sharing clothing; or doing other regular daily activities.\nDiagnosis.\nIt is hard for doctors to diagnose syphilis just from the signs and symptoms that happen early on, because many diseases can cause skin sores and rashes. Instead, they can diagnose syphilis by doing a blood test, or by looking at the blood under a microscope. Blood tests are used more often, because they are easier to do. However, blood tests cannot tell which stage of syphilis a person has.\nPrevention.\n, there is no vaccine that prevents syphilis.\nSafer sex.\nNot having sexual contact with a person who has syphilis is one of the best ways to prevent getting syphilis.\nIf a person does not know if their sexual partner has syphilis, having safer sex can help protect them. For example, using a latex condom the right way lowers the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease like syphilis. However, even if a person uses a condom, it is still possible for him to get syphilis.\nBecause of this, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the best ways to prevent syphilis are:\nPreventing congenital syphilis.\nCongenital syphilis in newborn babies can be prevented by testing mothers for syphilis during early pregnancy and treating women who are infected. By following these steps, in 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate the spread of syphilis from Cuban mothers to their babies.\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the World Health Organization say that all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis. If a woman tests positive, her sexual partners (the people she has had sex with) should also be treated.\nIn most developed countries, congenital syphilis is not common. It still happens once in a while, when women do not get any health care during pregnancy. However, congenital syphilis is much more common in developing countries. Many women in these countries do not get healthcare during pregnancy, and others get healthcare that does not include testing for syphilis. When there are programs that make syphilis testing easier to get, fewer babies get congenital syphilis in these countries.\nPreventing syphilis from spreading.\nIf people do certain things, they are more likely to get syphilis. Medical professionals say that these people should get tested regularly. For example, the CDC says that men who have sex with men should be tested at least every year. Getting tested regularly helps prevent syphilis from being spread. If a person is tested and finds out that they have syphilis, they are more likely to get treatment, and will not accidentally spread syphilis to other people.\nSyphilis is a notifiable disease in many places, including Canada, the countries in the European Union, and the United States. This means that if a healthcare provider (like a doctor or a nurse) knows that a patient has syphilis, the provider has to tell public health authorities that the patient is infected. Public health workers then talk to all of the patient's sexual partners. They tell them someone might have given them syphilis, without telling them who that person is. Doctors might also try to get patients with syphilis to tell their sexual partners to get treatment.\nTreatment.\nEarly infections.\nSyphilis that is not complicated can usually be treated and cured by antibiotic medications.\nUsually, people need just one dose of penicillin G or azithromycin. If a person cannot take either of these medicines (for example, because they are allergic to them), some other medications work too. For example, Doxycycline and tetracycline are two other possible choices; however, they cannot be used in pregnant women.\nThe \"Treponema pallidum\" bacterium has become resistant to many different antibiotics, including macrolides, clindamycin, and rifampin. This means that these antibiotics no longer kill the bacterium.\nLate infections.\nOnce a person is in the later stages of syphilis, the disease is harder to treat.\nFor example, if a person has neurosyphilis, they need antibiotics that will kill the infection in their central nervous system (their brain and major nerves). However, it is hard for penicillin G to get into the central nervous system. Because of this, a single shot of penicillin - which will usually cure early syphilis - is not enough to cure neurosyphilis. Instead, people with neurosyphilis usually need to be given large doses of penicillin for at least 10 days. Usually, they also need to get the medicine intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein) so it goes more directly to the central nervous system. If a person is allergic to penicillin, other antibiotics like ceftriaxone, doxycycline, or tetracycline can be used, but they have to be given over longer periods of time.\nOnce a person has late-stage syphilis, treatment will keep their syphilis from getting any worse. However, if syphilis has already damaged the person's body, the treatment will not make that damage go away. At best, treatment can only have a very small effect on the damage that has already happened.\nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction.\nSometimes, the treatment for syphilis can cause a side effect called the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This reaction usually starts within one hour after treatment begins, and lasts for 24 hours. Its symptoms include fever, muscle pains, headache, and a fast heart rate.\nAntibiotic medication breaks open syphilis bacteria to kill them. As the bacteria break open, proteins come out of them. These proteins cause the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.\nEpidemiology.\nBy 1999, syphilis had infected about 12 million people. More than 90% of these people lived in the developing world.\nSyphilis causes problems in 700,000 to 1.6\u00a0million pregnancies every year. Syphilis can cause a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage, a stillbirth, a premature baby, a baby with congenital syphilis, or a baby that dies before it is a month old. In sub-Saharan Africa, syphilis causes up to 20% of perinatal deaths (deaths that happen soon after a baby is born).\nSyphilis used to be very common, and it caused sickness and death all over the world. It was especially very common in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. During the early 20th century, syphilis quickly became less common in the developed world, because antibiotics were being used more and more. Syphilis kept becoming less common until the 1980s and 1990s. Since the year 2000, syphilis is getting more common again in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Europe, mostly among men who have sex with men.\nIn China and Russia, syphilis has gotten more common among heterosexual (\"straight\") people since the 1990s. Studies say this is because of unsafe sexual practices, like having sex with many different people, prostitution (getting paid to have sex), and not having safer sex to protect against sexually transmitted diseases.\nOver the 19th and 20th centuries, the symptoms of syphilis have become less severe (not quite as bad). This is partly because there are more treatments that work well, and if they are given early, syphilis does not get as bad. Also, the bacteria that causes syphilis has become weaker.\nIf people with syphilis get treated early on, they can usually be cured without the disease causing damage that cannot be fixed. However, syphilis is still very dangerous. It still causes serious problems, and sometimes death, if it is not treated.\nSyphilis also makes a person two to five times more likely to get HIV. Confection (having both syphilis and HIV) is common. In some big cities, it happens in as many as 30% to 60% of people with syphilis.\nHistory.\nNobody knows exactly where and how syphilis started. There are two major ideas about where the disease came from.\nThe first idea is called the \"Columbian hypothesis.\" (A hypothesis is an educated guess about how something happened). This hypothesis says that when Christopher Columbus's crew came back to Europe after exploring the \"New World\", they brought syphilis back to Europe and spread the disease there.\nThe other idea is called the \"pre-Columbian hypothesis.\" (\"Pre-Columbian\" means \"before Columbus.\") This hypothesis says that syphilis was already in Europe before Columbus, and people just did not realize that the disease existed.\nWhile there is evidence that can be used to say that either of these ideas are right, there is more evidence for the Columbian hypothesis.\nThe first written records that talk about an outbreak of syphilis in Europe are from 1494-1495. The outbreak happened in Naples, Italy, when France was invading (trying to take over Italy). Because syphilis was spread by French soldiers who were coming back from Italy, at first it was called the \"French disease.\"\nThe name \"syphilis\" was first used in 1530 by an Italian doctor and poet named Girolamo Fracastoreo. He used the word \"syphilis\" as the title of a Latin poem that talked about the damage the disease was causing in Italy. At other times in history, syphilis was also called the \"Great Pox\".\nIn 1905, two men named Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann discovered that syphilis is caused by the \"Treponema pallidum\" bacteria. Five years later, Paul Ehrlich created the first treatment that helped treat syphilis (called Salvarsan). After that, scientists started to study penicillin. In 1943, it was officially decided that penicillin worked for syphilis.\nThis was a major success in the treatment of syphilis. Before penicillin, the treatments used for syphilis were often even worse than the disease. For example, people were treated with mercury (which is poisonous and causes serious health problems), or people were just kept away from everyone else.\nFrom 1932-1972, the United States Public Health Service did a study on syphilis in Alabama. They wanted to see how syphilis got worse when it was not treated. The researchers chose a group of poor African-American sharecroppers, but never told them they had syphilis. Even after the 1940s, when the researchers knew penicillin could cure these people, they refused to let them get treatment or even tell them that penicillin could help them. This study, now called the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, was very important in creating medical ethics.\nMany famous people in history may have had syphilis. For example, some people think that Franz Schubert, Arthur Schopenhauer, \u00c9douard Manet, and Adolf Hitler had the disease."}

At that time, this disease was described by coming from the \"Le Clapiers\" part of the city of Paris.

The day-long battle ended in the death of the Anglo-Saxon king and a decisive victory for the Normans. William, the Duke of Normandy, was crowned as King William I of England 10 weeks later. The Norman conquest was a major turning point in England's history.\nBackground.\nIn 1002 Ethelred King of England married Emma, the sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. The alliance formed by this marriage had far reaching effects. When King Canute came to the throne of England in 1016, he took Queen Emma of Normandy as his wife. Her two sons by her former marriage fled to Normandy for their own safety. Edward the Confessor the older son stayed in Normandy for many years at the court of the dukes. The last duke who protected him there was his cousin Duke William. Edward became king of England in 1042. in 1052 King Edward, who was childless, made William his heir. In 1065 Harold Godwinson was in Normandy. While he was there he promised Duke William he would support him as successor to the English throne. \nOn 5 January 1066 Edward the king died. But Harold did not respect his oath to William. The next day, the day of the funeral, Harold Godwinson was crowned king of England. The story was that on his deathbed the king had changed his mind and promised Harold the throne. Harold was not royalty himself and had no legal claim on the throne. For weeks William must have known Edward was dying. But the news of the king's death and Harold's taking the throne must have been a surprise.\nPrelude.\nWhen William heard the news that Harold had become king his reaction was swift. He called a meeting of his greatest men. William made plans to gather a large army from all over France. His influence and wealth meant he could mount a large campaign. His first task was to build a fleet of ships to carry his army across the English Channel. Then he started gathering an army. His friendship with Brittany, France, and Flanders meant he did not have to rely only on his own army. He hired and paid soldiers from many parts of Europe. William asked for and got the support of the pope who gave him a banner to carry into battle. At the same time Duke William was planning his invasion so too was Harald Hardrada. The king of England knew both would be coming but he kept his ships and forces in the south of England where William might land. \nWilliam may have had as many as 1,000 ships in his invasion fleet. They had favorable winds to leave Normandy on the night of 27 September 1066. William's ship, the Mora, was a gift of his wife, Matilda. It led the fleet to the landing at Pevensey the next morning. As soon as he landed William got news of King Harold's victory over the Norwegian king at Stamford Bridge in the north of England. Harold also received news that William had landed at Pevensey and came south as quickly as he could. The king rested at London for a few days before taking his army to meet William and his French forces.\nThe battle.\nKing Harold's army took up a position on an east-west ridge north of Hastings. The ridge itself was called Senlac Hill. They found the Norman army marching up the valley in front of them. While Harold had more soldiers, they were tired from the from London. William formed his lines at the base of the hill facing the shield wall of the English. He sent his archers halfway up the slope to attack the English. He sent his mounted knights to the left and right to find any weak spots. At first William's knights tried to break through the shield wall with the weight of their horses. But they were attacking uphill and could not gain any speed. Harold's front line simply stood fast and was able to fend off any attacks. William's army began to fall back with rumors of Duke William's death. William removed his helmet so his men could see he was still alive. When William saw that many of Harold's men were following his knights back down the hill, he used a trick he had learned years before. He turned suddenly and charged the oncoming English foot soldiers, who had no chance against mounted knights.\nThis tactic worked at least two more times during the battle and made Harold's shield wall weaker. Next William used something new. Where his attacks by knights and soldiers had been separate movements he now used them together. Where his archers had not succeeded against the shield wall he had them shoot high into the air so the arrows came down on top of the English. This may be where King Harold was killed by an arrow through his eye. The shield wall finally broke and the Normans were on top of them. By nightfall the English were either dead on the field or being hunted down by William's men. William called his men back and they spent the night camped on the battle field. \nAftermath.\nThe battle was won, but the English still had smaller armies which had not joined King Harold at Hastings. They had lost their king but were still trying to reorganize. William rested his army for five days before moving towards London. His line of march took him through several towns he either captured or destroyed. When William reached London the English resisted for a short time but in the end surrendered. \nThe Battle of Hastings was a major turning point in English history. William's claim to the throne was strong, and he was able to back it up with force. On Christmas Day in 1066 William was crowned King of England.\nSome time later the battle was pictured on a series of panels called the Bayeux Tapestry. His victory at Hastings gave William the nickname he has been known by ever since: 'William the '."}

It is the largest settlement in Berkshire. It is home to about 230,000 people. Reading is found in South East England, between London and Bristol. The River Thames goes through the town. Reading replaced Abingdon as the county town of Berkshire in 1867.\nHistory.\nThere is a large statue of a lion in Forbury Gardens, and local legend has it that the sculptor killed himself by jumping off the top because he had sculpted the legs wrong. The lion is a memorial to soldiers from Berkshire who were killed in Maiwand, (Afghanistan) in a war in 1880.\nReading is the home of a school which used to be a Hospital in World War I and World War II. It is named Redlands Primary School. \nMadejski stadium is home to the Reading Football Club whose nickname is \"The Royals\". They are also known as the \"Biscuit Men\". The stadium was opened on 22 August 1998. \nReading is the largest town in England. Of course, there are larger cities in England but Reading has not been granted city status and it doesn't have a cathedral. Also, Reading is home to the Oracle, a huge shopping centre and a large university named University of Reading. \nReading began life as a Saxon Settlement. Reading was originally called Reada Ingas, which means people of Reada. Reada was a Saxon leader in the area with his tribe in the 6th century. \nThe Normans built a wooden castle in Reading. It was later replaced by a stone castle. The king then demolished the castle in 1152 fearing it might come into the hands of his enemies. \nReading was an important centre in the medieval period, as the site of Reading Abbey, a monastery with strong royal connections \nThe Huntley and Palmer's biscuit factory was the biggest in the world in 1914 and one factory was built on Kings Road by George Palmer in 1846. \n\"The Blade\" in central Reading is the tallest building in Reading. It is 86 metres tall. It is visible from many places in the town. \nPalmer Park was founded by George Palmer and it has a statue of George Palmer in it. Palmer Park was built for his workers to rest and people still enjoy using the park today. \nThere is a very famous hospital called The Royal Berkshire Hospital. It was opened in 1839. \nLots of schools in Reading took part in \"Beat The Street\" in 2015.\nNotable people.\nTV presenter Chris Tarrant (\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\") and comedian Ricky Gervais are from Reading, and also actress Kate Winslet, who has a road named after her. Musician Mike Oldfield is also from Reading. Tony Sullivan (local legend) is also a resident in the town. The town has two universities and is famous for its rock festival. Reading is home to Championship football and rugby teams."}

The term goes back to \"duodecim\", which means 12 in Latin. Humans might have started to count on a base 12 because there are approximately 12 cycles of the moon in one cycle of the sun. In other words, a solar year has 12 months. The first to have used the unit were probably the Mesopotamians.\n12 dozen (144 items) are a gross. 12 gross (1728 items) are called a \"great gross\". \nA great hundred is 120 or ten dozen (a dozen for each finger on both hands).\nThe dozen is convenient because its multipliers and multiples are convenient: 12 = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, and 360 = 30 \u00d7 12. The French word \"douzaine\" means \"about twelve\" and is part of a family of words with similar meanings, e.g. \"vingtaine\" \u2013 \"about 20\" \"centaine\" \u2013 \"about 100\" etc. A baker's dozen, also known as a long dozen, is thirteen.\nExamples:\nI have a dozen doughnuts \nthere is a dozen of members in a team"}

It was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1837 in the third volume of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\" with \"The Emperor's New Clothes\". The tale glorifies suffering and self-denial. There is a statue of The Little Mermaid in the harbor of Copenhagen. The story has been adapted to opera and animated movies.\nStory.\nA mermaid princess swims to the surface of the sea. As it happens, she sees a human prince and falls in love with him. She wants to meet him again; however, she is a mermaid, and her father, who is the king of the sea, would not let her do so. She wants to find a way to win the prince's love, so she goes to the sea witch's cave. She will get an immortal soul if she wins the love of a human. She sacrifices her voice and her tail to the sea witch for two human legs. The prince becomes her companion. But, he falls in love with another person. The mermaid has the chance to return to the sea. She must kill the prince to go back, and so she refuses. She dies, and is transformed into a daughter of the air. She will receive an immortal soul if she does good deeds for three hundred years.\nAdaptations.\nIn 1957, Germaine Tailleferre wrote a three act opera with the subject. In 1968, there was a Soviet animated movie. In 1976, a co-production of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria resulted in a live-action movie. In 1989, The Walt Disney Company also made an animated movie. In 2008, Studio Ghibli made a movie inspired by the story called Ponyo."}

It can be found on both sides of the Atlantic. It can grow up to 45cm in length, weighing more than half a kilogram. It is a swarm fish, meaning many fish come together and form a \"school\" (or swarm) of fish. Swarms of up to 4 cubic kilometers in size have been measured of \"atlantic herring\", with an eastimated 4 billion individual fish. Like with so many other fishes though, commercial overfishing is posing a problem. Stocks of herring have been collapsing. \nTheir natural predators are seals, cod, other large fish as well as some kinds of whales. \nThe current reason for the overfishing is the need of the Omega Fatty Acid, which helps increase memory, and brain functions.\nBaltic herring.\nThe herrings that occurs in the Baltic Sea is much smaller. Some people consider it a dstinct subspecies. They call it Baltic herring, \"C. harengus membras.\""}

The official language is Arabic and English is used as an additional language for many purposes, including business and tourism purposes. Muscat is located on the north east coast of Oman. The city is 3,500\u00a0km2 in size.\nHistory.\nPeople started living in the Muscat area about 2300 years ago but the first writings of the city are about 1900 years old in the 1st century CE. Muscat developed into an important city in the 9th century CE because of business and trade at the port. Portugal, Persian (Iran) and Turkey had many wars for control over Muscat from the 1500s to the 1700s. The Al Bu Sa 'id tribe has ruled Muscat since then.\nClimate and weather.\nMuscat is a hot and dry city. The average daytime temperature in summer can be as high as 40\u00a0\u00b0C. The winter is cooler and the average daytime temperature is between 19\u00a0\u00b0C and 22\u00a0\u00b0C. There is very little rain with only 10\u00a0cm per year.\nTourism.\nMuscat has several tourist sites including seven museums, a fort, an old palace and a new opera house. The city has beaches with hotel resorts. People can do many water-sports including dolphin tours in the city's harbour. In 2016, 2.5 million tourists visited Muscat. According to an article in Times Of Oman, almost 500,000 people visited in February alone for the popular Muscat Festival."}

She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She became a leader of the team of nurses who helped wounded soldiers during the Crimean War. \nShe was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, one of the highest honours awarded by the British monarch. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. Florence Nightingale was a wonderful woman, coming from a wealthy family she refused the aristocrat lifestyle her family expected from her and instead focused on helping the poor, the injured and the sick. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer, and lived to be 90 years old.\nIn her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs and diagrams to display data.\nNightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium spread by people drinking water contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory.\nThe miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes that kept sewage from seeping into the water supply.\nLife.\nFlorence Nightingale was born into an upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl. She was a Unitarian. Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother, in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain.\nIn 1854 when the Crimean War began, Florence was working in Harley Street in London. After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers, she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty.\nShe knew Sidney Herbert, who was Secretary of War during the Crimean War and he helped her. At the hospital in Istanbul where the injured soldiers were sent, Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war. She was, however, quite wrong about how cholera spread.\nThere is a syndrome named after her called \"Florence Nightingale Syndrome\". It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse. While she was working in Crimea she became known as \u201cThe Lady with the Lamp\u201d because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers.\nWhen she returned to England she started a school in 1860 for nurses at St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London. She wrote her most important book \"Notes on Nursing\". She was a keen Christian but also believed that pagan and eastern religions also contained genuine worth. She was a strong opponent of discrimination against all types of Christians as well as against non-Christians. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work.\nIn 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII.\n Florence Nightingale died in her room peace fully in her sleep from heart attack in 1910 in London. There are many statues of her in Britain, including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum, also in London."}

The US and its allies forced the Taliban and Al-Qaeda to hide. In December 2001, the US and its allies founded a new government for Afghanistan. Its president was Hamid Karzai. \nBy February 2002, 5,000 soldiers from ISAF (or \"International Security Assistance Force\") were in Afghanistan. That military force was led by United States.

{"id": "34141", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34141", "title": "Castrato", "text": "A castrato (plural \"castrati\") was a type of male singer with a very high voice. The effect was produced either through castration, or because of some hormonal problems. The word \"castrato\" literally means castrated. Such singers were very sought after in the early days of the opera. Most of the main soprano roles in operas by Handel and other composers of that time were written for castrati. Nowadays they are almost always sung by female sopranos, since there are no castrati left.\nThe practice of castrating young boys who had good singing voices was quite common in Italy in the 17th century. When castration is done before puberty, the usual effects of puberty will not happen. These include the vocal cords enlarging and growing bigger, and the voice getting deeper as a consequence. \nEven though castration was illegal in many parts of Italy, it was often performed. Many families who were poor had their children castrated because it might give them a better future. \nOnce a boy was castrated he would go to a special music school where children learned singing and musical instruments. The castrati pupils were given special treatment. They were fussed over and kept warm to stop them from getting colds. When they grew up they hoped to become famous opera singers. A few of them had very successful careers in opera. They were the great stars of their day, and audiences came to the opera to cheer on their favourite singers. Those who were not good enough to make a career in opera joined church choirs instead.\nIt is impossible now for us to know what these great castrato voices sounded like, but they must have had very powerful voices and many of the singers were very skilled in singing and adding musical ornamentation to the songs. In the 18th century Italian opera became very popular in England. This was largely due to the German-born composer Georg Friderich H\u00e4ndel who moved to England in 1709 and wrote lots of Italian operas. Many singers who sang in London came from Italy, and many were castrati. The most famous one was called Farinelli. \nThe popularity of castrato singers died out in the 19th century when operas became less artificial and more like real life. By the mid-19th century they were no opera castrati left, although a few castrati still sang in church choirs. The last one, a man called Alessandro Moreschi, died in 1922 aged 64. There is a recording of his voice made in 1902 which can be heard online, but he may not have been a good singer and he was old when he made the recording, so we cannot judge whether the castrato voice was beautiful by that recording."}
{"id": "34142", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34142", "title": "Falsetto", "text": "A falsetto voice is a special way of speaking or singing. If a man tries to imitate a woman\u2019s voice he does it by speaking in a falsetto voice. When a man sings with a falsetto voice it sounds high like a soprano. Actors do this sometimes, e.g. Robin Williams in the film \"Mrs Doubtfire\" or Kevin Clash when voicing the character Elmo in \"Sesame Street\" and Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, with his R&amp;B falsetto. Also, Kellin Quinn from the band sleeping With Sirens uses falsetto sometimes.\nWomen can also use falsetto, but when they do there is not as big of a change in sound from their normal voices as there is in men. When women use falsetto the voice sounds lighter or weaker than it does when they speak or sing normally.\nIt is like stretching the mouth out into a wide smile and saying 'ee', except it is sung.\nProcesses and uses of falsetto.\nWhen people speak or sing, their vocal cords vibrate. When a man sings falsetto only the edges of his vocal cords vibrate. These produce harmonics. It is similar to playing harmonics on a string instrument by lightly touching the string at a certain point so that only part of the string vibrates. When a man sings falsetto his is usually one octave higher than his normal singing voice. When people sing in falsetto, their voice can be breathy sometimes.\nFalsetto singing was used in the days when women were not allowed to sing in churches. Instead, men sang countertenor. Later the popularity of the countertenor disappeared, but in the mid 20th century it became popular again for performing Renaissance and Baroque music. Today the tradition of men singing alto (with countertenor voices) still exists in Britain in cathedral choirs and some church choirs which are all-male choirs. It is not a big, operatic voice, and it blends in well with boys\u2019 treble voices in the acoustic of churches and cathedrals. \nOccasionally falsetto can be used for comic effect, as in the roasted swan in the \"Carmina Burana\" by Carl Orff."}

They did not have big, dramatic voices like castrati, so they were not normally used in opera. People forgot about this way of singing in the 18th and 19th centuries, although male altos continued to sing in English cathedral and church choirs. In the 20th century an English countertenor called Alfred Deller became very famous. He sang many songs from the Baroque period that had been written for the countertenor voice, for example songs by Henry Purcell who sang countertenor himself. Today there is a lot of interest again in using this type of voice for performing early music like Renaissance and Baroque music."}

It is also called a trouser role (British) or pants role (U.S.) or travesti role (the Italian word). It is called a breeches role because breeches are tight-fitting, knee-length trousers. These used to be worn by men at the time that breeches roles became popular. Sometimes breeches roles are in plays, but they are usually in opera.\nBreeches roles are usually female singers acting the role of a young man. They are normally sung by mezzo-sopranos or contraltos with light voices because they can often sound boyish. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was normal to have actors and actresses who cross-dressed. It was the time when castrato singers were popular. These castrati were men pretending to be women, but there were also women pretending to be men (especially when the actress was trying to deceive another character) and the audiences were used to this kind of thing. As they gradually stopped the horrible practice of castrating young boys in the late 18th century these male characters started to be sung by mezzo-sopranos instead.\nMozart wrote an opera called \"The Marriage of Figaro\". In this opera the role of Cherubino, a young page boy, is sung by a mezzo-soprano. Other famous examples include the role of Siebel in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s opera \"Rusalka\" and the role of Prince Orlofsky in Johann Strauss\u2019s opera \"Die Fledermaus\".\nComposers from the 20th century do not usually have breeches roles in their operas. There is the role of Oktavian in Richard Strauss\u2019s opera \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (1911), but this opera was deliberately trying to produce the old-fashioned atmosphere of Mozart\u2019s time. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera called \"Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\", based on Shakespeare\u2019s play. There is no breeches role here. Instead, the part of Oberon is written for a countertenor: a man with a high, falsetto voice.\nThere is also a term called a skirt role. This is the opposite of a trouser role: it is a man acting the part of a woman. Benjamin Britten uses one in the role of the Madwoman in \"Curlew River\". The witch in Humperdinck\u2019s \"Hansel and Gretel\" is also sung by a man. In both cases it makes the characters more dramatic, but the first is very serious while the second is supposed to be humorous."}

Often it is called boy soprano, but since there are also many girls who sing in cathedral and church choirs these days, the word treble is now used to describe the voice of either sex.\nA boy can sing treble until he reaches puberty. At puberty he starts to become a man and his voice range will go down (we say that his voice \u201cbreaks\u201d). He will then become a tenor, baritone or bass, or he may even train to be a countertenor. A girl\u2019s voice also changes when she reaches puberty, but the change into a grown-up female voice is more gradual than with a boy, and it is still within the soprano or alto range.\nBoys who join a cathedral choir or the choir of a large church will have to work hard to develop their voice and learn to sing musically. They often start this training aged 7 or 8, and they may only have four or five years before their voice starts to break. They do not usually become famous as soloists, but the Welsh treble Aled Jones became very famous for about three years and made many recordings before his voice broke in 1987.\nThe word \u2018treble\u2019 is used for children singing in a Classical Music style, especially church music. Although children do not usually sing in opera, occasionally a treble is used for the part of a very small boy, e.g. in Debussy\u2019s opera \"P\u00e9ll\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\"."}

Usually it means an \"organised\" group who know in advance what they are going to do.\nIn the 19th century there was very often a claque at performances of an opera. Someone who liked one of the singers and wanted them to have lots of applause would pay a group of people to sit near the back of the opera house and to clap and shout enthusiastically whenever that singer had finished a song. This would encourage the rest of the audience to clap loudly too. Sometimes the claque would be paid to do the opposite: they would be told to hiss and boo when the singer had sung.\nVery often a singer would have to pay some money to the claque so that they would applaud him (or her). If the singer did not pay, the claque would hiss and boo. This was, of course, a nasty form of blackmail. In the early 20th century, when the world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso refused to pay the claque in Naples a bribe, they hissed during his singing of the great aria \"Una furtiva lagrima\".\nGroups of supporters at football ('soccer') matches do much the same thing without being paid.

The first Europen settlers were the Ruffy brothers who arrived in 1836. They later opened the Cranbourne Inn.\nThe area was opened up by settlers from the 1860s. Progress in developing the land around Cranbourne was difficult because of the Koo Wee Rup swamp. William Lyall bought land in the swamp area. He helped organize draining the swamp to make it usable as farmland. The region has a strong farming history. A major cattle market started at Cranbourne in the 1870s. This was helped with the arrival of the railway in 1887. A market gardening industry began after World War I with the arrival of Italian immigrants.\nCranbourne has a long history of horse racing. The first races were held in 1867. The Cranbourne Racecourse and Recreation Reserve and the Cranbourne Training Complex are popular facilities. There is a Cranbourne Cup race meeting every year as well as other carnivals.\nIn the 1860s, a number of iron meteorites were discovered in the area. The largest, at 3.5 tonnes, was at the time, the largest discovered in the world. It was known as the Cranbourne meteorite. It was sold to the British Museum.\nCranbourne was made a town in 1861. The Shire of Cranbourne was begun in 1868. The office, built in 1875, is still standing on the corner of South Gippsland Highway and Sladen Street. In 1994 the Shire was made a City. Later in the same year most of the City joined with the City of Berwick to form the City of Casey.\nRapid growth.\nOver the years Cranbourne has changed from a small country town to a rapidly growing suburb. The exact time of when Cranbourne had changed from town to suburb is not really known. The number of people living in Cranbourne has grown quickly since the 1970s. There were 1,800 people in 1976, rising to 14,005 in 1986 and 18,886 in 1991. Cranbourne's current population is estimated to be at least 30,000 people.\nSport.\nCranbourne has many sports facilities including:\nBotanic Gardens.\nThe Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne is a part of Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens. At Cranbourne there are a lot of Australian plants on display. One feature is an arid lands garden which has a red sand dune with desert plants.\nSchools.\nSchools in the Cranbourne area include:\nBecause of the growth in Cranbourne several new primary schools are being planned.\nChisholm Institute of TAFE also has a campus in Cranbourne, to the city's east.\nShopping centres.\nShopping centres in the Cranbourne area include:\nFast food.\nCranbourne is home to many fast food stores including Fish n' Chips and Pizza shops.

{"id": "34190", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34190", "title": "Rwandan genocide", "text": "The Rwandan genocide happened in 1994. It started in April and lasted 100 days. During that time, about 800,000 people were murdered.\nIn a genocide, many or all people in a group are killed because of their ethnicity, colour, religion, or political opinions. In the Rwandan genocide, members of an ethnic group called the Tutsi (\"abatutsi\") were killed because of their ethnicity. The killers were extremist members of another ethnic group called the Hutu (\"abahutu\"). The Hutu killers also killed other Hutus whose political beliefs were not as extreme as theirs.\nBackground.\nIn 1994, almost all Rwandan people (85%) were Hutus. However, for many years, the Tutsi minority had more power and ran the Rwandan government. In 1959, the Hutus overthrew the Tutsi government and took power. Tens of thousands of Tutsis ran away to nearby countries.\nA group of the Tutsis in exile created a rebel group. They called it the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The RPF invaded Rwanda in 1990, starting the Rwandan Civil War. The Tutsi rebels and the Hutu government fought until 1993, when the two sides signed a peace agreement.\nHowever, on April 6, 1994, an airplane carrying the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi was shot down. Both Presidents were Hutus. Nobody knows for sure who shot down the plane. The RPF said the Hutu extremists had shot down the plane themselves, just because they wanted an excuse to start killing people. The Hutu extremists blamed the Tutsi RPF, and right away, they started killing Tutsis.\nWithin a half an hour, Hutu militias had blocked roads all over Kigali, Rwanda's capital city. They stopped every car that came by, and killed every Tutsi they found. The Rwandan genocide began that day.\nThe genocide.\nIn the next 100 days, members of the Hutu government's army, militias, and even civilians would kill 800,000 people an average of 8,000 people every day. This makes the Rwandan Genocide one of the fastest genocides in history.\nThe two main militia groups that carried out the killings were the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi. These were supposed to be youth organizations of two pro-Hutu political parties. However, the government turned them into militias to carry out the genocide.\nWithin a few hours after the Presidents' deaths, military leaders in Rwanda's different provinces called together militia and civilians. They told them that the President was dead, and that the Tutsi RPF had killed him. Then they ordered the crowd to kill Tutsis, saying things like: \"Begin your work!\" and \"Spare no one!\" including babies.\nKilling moderate politicians.\nJust after the Presidents' deaths, Hutu extremists assassinated the Rwandan prime minister. They also tortured and killed the ten Belgian soldiers that had been assigned to protect her.\nAfter that, throughout the night of April 6-7, Hutu militias and the Rwandan army got lists of people in the government who were political moderates (meaning they were not extremists). They found these people in Kigali and killed them.p.\u00a0230 They did this so the moderates would not be able to stop the genocide. They also killed journalists and human rights activists who had spoken out against the Hutu government.\nKilling civilians.\nThe first days.\nOn the night of April 6, Hutu militias also went house to house in Kigali, killing Tutsis. By the morning of April 7th, the killings had only gotten worse. Interahamwe killed and looted however they wanted. Other countries' journalists were able to film many of these things. In a few days, the genocide had spread all over the country. As the genocide spread out into the rural parts of Rwanda, the killers paid less attention to murdering moderate Hutus and more attention to massacring Tutsis.\nThe genocide spreads.\nThe Rwandan Genocide was committed in a very organized way. For example, the genocide's leaders made lists of people who were against the Hutu-led government. They gave these lists to militias, who went and killed those people, along with their families. The militias also blocked roads so they could check the identification cards of everyone who came by. These cards had a person's ethnic group listed on them. When they found a Tutsi, the militias would kill the person. Often, they used machetes. When Tutsis tried to hide from the killers, the militias would search every building in an area, inch by inch, until they found the people who were hiding. Buses even drove the killers from massacre to massacre.\nThe army and militias were very brutal towards women. They raped between 150,000 and 250,000 Tutsi women. They also kidnapped women and forced them to be sex slaves. After raping women, the rapists would often mutilate the women's sex organs with things like weapons, boiling water, or acid.\nMost victims of the genocide were killed in their own villages. Often, they were killed by their own neighbors. Government radio stations encouraged regular people to kill their Tutsi neighbors. Hutus who refused to kill Tutsis were often executed immediately. Husbands killed their Tutsi wives because they were scared of being killed if they refused. There were even priests and nuns convicted of killing people who were trying to hide in churches. As historian Richard Prunier explains: during the genocide, \"Either you took part in the massacres or you were massacred yourself.\"p.\u00a0247\nPropaganda.\nThe killers used propaganda to encourage the genocide. They set up radio stations and newspapers which were full of hate speech. Often, they encouraged people to \"weed out the cockroaches,\" which meant \"kill the Tutsis.\" The killers would read out the names of people they wanted to be killed over the radio. Radio stations told their listeners to make sure they disemboweled pregnant \nTutsi women.\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda.\nIn October 1993, the United Nations Security Council created the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). It was supposed to help put the 1993 peace agreement into place. However, UNAMIR did not have permission from the Security Council to protect civilians or try to stop the genocide. At this time, UNAMIR soldiers were only allowed to shoot their weapons in self-defence, if somebody was attacking them personally. They were not allowed to use their weapons or get involved to protect civilians who were being attacked.\nSecurity Council response.\nMore and more, UNAMIR's peacekeeping troops were being attacked. Countries began to pull their soldiers out of Rwanda. Some members of the United Nations Security Council, like the United States, argued strongly that the UN should take \"all\" of its peacekeeping troops out of Rwanda. Eventually, the Security Council decided to decrease the number of troops UNAMIR was allowed to have. On April 21, 1994, as the genocide was spreading across Rwanda, the Security Council decreased the number of allowed UNAMIR troops from 2,548 to 270 a decrease of almost 90%.\nUNAMIR's Commander, Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, kept asking the United Nations for more troops. On May 15, the Security Council increased UNAMIR's allowed number of troops to 5,500. However, it took almost six months for UN member countries to volunteer this many troops. Meanwhile, the genocide continued.\nFrance and Operation Turquoise.\nFrance offered to lead a humanitarian mission in southwest Rwanda while UNAMIR was trying to gather more troops. The Security Council approved this mission on June 22, 1994. France called the mission \"Operation Turquoise.\" During this operation, soldiers from France and other countries set up a \"safe zone\" in southwest Rwanda. This was meant to be an area where people could come to be protected from Hutu attacks. Historians think that Operation Turquoise saved 13,000 to 14,000 lives.p.\u00a0308 However, France has been accused of letting war criminals escape Rwanda through the safe zone.\nMassacres.\nBecause UNAMIR's troops were not allowed to use their weapons to protect civilians, the militias were able to massacre civilians even when UNAMIR troops were nearby.\nKigali.\nFor example, on April 7, 1994, Belgian soldiers were staying at a school outside Kigali. Thousands of Tutsis ran from Kigali to the school, hoping that the soldiers would protect them from the massacres that were happening in Kigali. Hutu militia surrounded the school, but they did not enter because they were afraid of the Belgian soldiers.\nHowever, one day, the Belgian soldiers left. They had been ordered to leave so they could take European people to the airport to get them out of the country. Later, a Belgian colonel \"said the young soldiers told him they saw the killers in their rearview mirrors\" as they drove away. After the soldiers left, the Hutu militia killed thousands of Tutsis.\nMurambi Technical School.\nAnother massacre happened in Murambi, a town in southern Rwanda. When the genocide reached Murambi, Tutsis tried to hide at a nearby church. However, the bishop and mayor tricked them by telling them to go to the Murambi Technical School. They said the French soldiers there would protect them. On April 16, 1994, about 65,000 Tutsis ran to the school. One survivor said: \"They gave us four [French soldiers] for protection, but from 17 April we never saw them again.\"\nAfter they got to the school, the Tutsis had no food. The school's water was also cut off, so the Tutsis would be too weak to fight back. The Tutsis were still able to fight back for a few days, using stones. However, on April 21, the school was attacked by the Interahamwe. They killed about 45,000 Tutsis at the school. The other 20,000 Tutsis ran to a nearby church to hide, but the militia found them there and killed almost all of them.\nThe school is now a genocide museum. The museum says that only 34 people out of 65,000 survived the massacre. It also says that after the massacre, the French soldiers came back and buried the bodies in mass graves. Then they put a volleyball court over the mass graves to hide what happened.\nIndependent report on UN \"failure\".\nIn 1999, Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, asked for an independent report about the Rwandan Genocide. He wanted to know why the United Nations and the world had \"failed\" to stop the Rwandan Genocide. The report said that the major failures were:\nEnd of the genocide.\nThe Ugandan army joined the RPF in fighting the extremist Hutus. Bit by bit, they took control of more parts of Rwanda. Finally, on July 4, 1994, they took control of Kigali.\nAfter this, about two million Hutus ran away from Rwanda to Zaire. This group included 1.4 million Hutu civilians who had nothing to do with the genocide, but had been told that the RPF would kill them just for being Hutus.\nAccording to the BBC, \"Human rights groups say the RPF killed thousands of Hutu civilians as they took power and more after they went into [Zaire] to [follow] the Interahamwe. The RPF denies this.\"\nVictims.\nIn 1994, Rwanda's population was 7.9 million. After the genocide:\nBefore the genocide, about 1.1 million of Rwandans were Tutsis. After the genocide, there were only about 300,000 Tutsis left in the country. Almost three out of every four Tutsis in Rwanda had been killed during the genocide.\nTrials and punishment.\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\nIn 1995, the United Nations Security Council set up the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Its goal was to prosecute people who took part in genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity, and punish the guilty ones. The ICTR had the power to prosecute anyone who broke international laws about human rights.\nThe ICTR was the first international court ever to:\nOut of 93 people indicted by the ICTR, 61 were found guilty and sent to prison. Another ten cases were sent to Rwanda so their own courts could hear the cases. Three people indicted by the ICTR are still fugitives.\nThe ICTR closed on December 31, 2015.\nRwandan courts.\nThe Rwandan government was not able to start trying genocide suspects until 1996. This was because so many judges had been killed in the genocide, and because so many court buildings and jails had been destroyed.\nBy 2000, there were over 100,000 suspects waiting for trials. The regular Rwandan courts could not handle this many cases. To help with this problem, the government set up a new and different system of courts to help the regular Rwandan courts.\nBy mid-2006, the Rwandan courts had tried over 10,000 genocide suspects.\nGacaca courts.\nIn 2001, the Rwandan government began to create a system of Gacaca courts (pronounced \"GA-CHA-CHA\"). In these courts, Rwandans elect judges to hear genocide suspects' trials. Gacaca courts may hear cases about any crimes except planning genocide or rape.

When a female's ovum and a male's sperm cell join, the cell that results is called the zygote. The zygote then multiplies, and grows into an embryo. So, a zygote is formed from the union of two gametes, and is the first stage in a human organism's development. Zygotes are produced by fertilization between two haploid cells, the ovum and the sperm cells, which make a diploid cell. Diploid cells have copies of both parents' chromosomes and DNA. At conception it has all the necessary properties to create a fully formed human being. Life until death is a series of many different stages of development. \nSome animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full-grown baby. The time between the forming of the zygote and the baby's birth is called pregnancy. Other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies, but lay an egg. The zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and a larva or baby animal hatches."}

This can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart's demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die. With cardiac arrest, normal circulation of blood stops, because of a failure of the heart to contract. This results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood, which causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation. Cerebral hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing, and this makes the heart stop completely. Unless the person is in hypothermia, brain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes. (In some cases, the person is put into hypothermia on purpose, to help the person recover better with less damage.)\nCardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If it is treated early enough, some of the damage done can be reversed in certain groups of patients. When cardiac arrest leads to a person's death, this is called sudden cardiac death (SCD). First aid treatment for cardiac arrest usually begins with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to keep oxygenated blood flowing until medical treatment is available."}

The release of heat can produce light in the form of a flame.\nCar engines and rocket engines both work by combustion. Combustion in a Ferrari car motor is different from combustion in a rocket engine. Car combustion is gas burning and exploding in cylinders called pistons again and again to push them up and down, making the car move. Rocket combustion is made by rocket fuel exploding out of the back of the rocket moving it up. The burning of most substances is bad for the environment and the ozone layer because it can let off greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Hydrogen burns cleanly and gives off a lot of heat, but it does not produce much power, and is highly explosive.\nDuring combustion, fuel reacts with oxygen and heat, then releases energy. Complete combustion happens in a plentiful supply of oxygen. Complete combustion releases more energy than incomplete combustion. Incomplete combustion occurs when the supply of air is limited, or poor. Incomplete combustion also creates carbon monoxide, and more soot. Several factors must be considered when choosing the best fuel for a particular purpose. Fuels are substances that react with oxygen to release useful energy. Most of the energy is released as heat, but light energy is also released. About 21 per cent of the air is oxygen. When a fuel burns in plenty of air, it receives enough oxygen for complete combustion. Complete combustion needs a plentiful supply of air so that the elements in the fuel react fully with oxygen. Fuels such as natural gas and petrol contain hydrocarbons. These are compounds of hydrogen and carbon only. Combustion is a high-temperature oxidation reaction."}

{"id": "34227", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34227", "title": "Hummingbird", "text": " \nHummingbirds are small birds of the family Trochilidae.\nThey are among the smallest of birds: most species measure 7.5\u201313\u00a0cm (3\u20135\u00a0in). The smallest living bird species is the 2\u20135\u00a0cm Bee Hummingbird. They can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 12\u201380 times per second (depending on the species). They are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards. Their rapid wing beats do actually hum. They can fly at speeds over 15\u00a0m/s (54\u00a0km/h, 34\u00a0mi/h).\nEating habits and pollination.\nHummingbirds help flowers to pollinate, though most insects are best known for doing so. The hummingbird enjoys nectar, like the butterfly and other flower-loving insects, such as bees.\nHummingbirds do not have a good sense of smell; instead, they are attracted to color, especially the color red. Unlike the butterfly, the hummingbird hovers over the flower as it drinks nectar from it, like a moth. When it does so, it flaps its wings very quickly to stay in one place, which makes it look like a blur and also beats so fast it makes a humming sound. A hummingbird sometimes puts its whole head into the flower to drink the nectar properly. When it takes its head back out, its head is covered with yellow pollen, so that when it moves to another flower, it can pollinate. Or sometimes it may pollinate with its beak.\nLike bees, hummingbirds can assess the amount of sugar in the nectar they eat. They reject flowers whose nectar has less than 10% sugar. Nectar is a poor source of nutrients, so hummingbirds meet their needs for protein, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, etc. by preying on insects and spiders.\nFeeding apparatus.\nMost hummingbirds have bills that are long and straight or nearly so, but in some species the bill shape is adapted for specialized feeding. Thornbills have short, sharp bills adapted for feeding from flowers with short corollas and piercing the bases of longer ones. The Sicklebills' extremely decurved bills are adapted to extracting nectar from the curved corollas of flowers in the family Gesneriaceae. The bill of the Fiery-tailed Awlbill has an upturned tip, as in the Avocets. The male Tooth-billed Hummingbird has barracuda-like spikes at the tip of its long, straight bill.\nThe two halves of a hummingbird's bill have a pronounced overlap, with the lower half (mandible) fitting tightly inside the upper half (maxilla). When hummingbirds feed on nectar, the bill is usually only opened slightly, allowing the tongue to dart out into the nectar.\nLike the similar nectar-feeding sunbirds and unlike other birds, hummingbirds drink by using grooved or trough-like tongues which they can stick out a long way.\nHummingbirds do not spend all day flying, as the energy cost would be prohibitive; the majority of their activity consists simply of sitting or perching. Hummingbirds feed in many small meals, consuming many small invertebrates and up to twelve times their own body weight in nectar each day. They spend an average of 10\u201315% of their time feeding and 75\u201380% sitting and digesting.\nCo-evolution with flowers.\nSince hummingbirds are specialized nectar-eaters, they are tied to the bird-flowers they feed upon. Some species, especially those with unusual bill shapes such as the Sword-billed Hummingbird and the sicklebills, are co-evolved with a small number of flower species.\nMany plants pollinated by hummingbirds produce flowers in shades of red, orange, and bright pink, though the birds will take nectar from flowers of many colors. Hummingbirds can see wavelengths into the near-ultraviolet. However, their flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect-pollinated flowers do. The narrow color spectrum may make hummingbird-pollinated flowers inconspicuous to insects, thereby reducing nectar robbing by insects. Hummingbird-pollinated flowers also produce relatively weak nectar (averaging 25% sugars w/w) containing high concentrations of sucrose, whereas insect-pollinated flowers typically produce more concentrated nectars dominated by fructose and glucose.\nTaxonomy.\nHummingbirds have traditionally been a part of the bird order Apodiformes. This order includes the hummingbirds, the swifts and the tree swifts. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based on DNA studies done in the 1970s and 1980s, changed the classification of hummingbirds. Instead of being in the same order as the swifts, the hummingbirds were made an order, the Trochiliformes. Their previous order, Apodiformes was changed to the superorder Apodimorphae. This superorder contains the three families of birds which were in it when it was an order."}

The series is made to be watched by adults, but the series gets a lot of people to watch it because of its humor. It uses satire to make fun of subjects such as current events, religion, politics, and pop culture. The show is controversial because of its use of profanity and sexual humor. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone also made a movie based on this series called \"\". Characters in \"South Park\" include Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick. These boys are 10 years old. The series is about them living in their town.\nOrigins.\n\" South Park\" began in 1992 when Trey Parker and Matt Stone met in their film class at the University of Colorado at Boulder. They made a short subject animated short called \"Jesus vs. Frosty\". The short movie had characters that were similar to the main characters in the present-day \"South Park\".\nLater on, an executive at FOX saw the movie. He hired Parker and Stone to make a second short movie to send to friends as a video Christmas card. This second video was called \"Jesus vs. Santa\". It had the same style as the \"South Park\" that can be seen today.\nCharacters.\nThe voices in \"South Park\" are done by a small number of actors. Most of the male voices are done by Matt Stone and Trey Parker. The female voices are done by April Stewart and Mona Marshall (formerly Mary Kay Bergman and Eliza Schneider). Other voices are done by Adrien Beard (Token black), and Vernon Chatman (Towelie).\nMain characters.\nBefore the start of season four, the main characters of the series were four third grade students (often called \"the boys\" when as a group for easier reference).\nStan is usually considered the serious and sensitive of the group. Stan is able to think clearly and is generally good-natured. Stan usually tries to come up with logical solutions to their outrageous situations. Stan's character is loosely based on the persona (public personality) of co-creator Trey Parker. His best friend is Kyle and their relationship is essential in several episodes, such as when he saves Kyle's life in \"Cherokee Hair Tampons\", \"Cartmanland\" and \"Super Best Friends\".\nKyle is the most easy-going character and the only Jewish one. Even though he is not particularly religious, he hates Cartman because Cartman is always making insulting comments about his faith. Kyle's character portrays the alter-ego of co-creator Matt Stone. Along with Stan, Kyle often gives a reasonable look on the crazy behavior of the adult world around them. Kyle is often shown as the most moral member of the four.\nEric is the most irrational of the main characters. Eric is fat and seems to dislike everything except food. He is often the main reason for the plot of each episode. Cartman commonly acts against the other boys. Cartman often insults Kyle for being Jewish and Kenny for being poor. In the earlier episodes, he would also insult Stan for having a girlfriend. Cartman is extremely and seems to be intelligent. However, this is shadowed by his racism and bigotry. Cartman sometimes serves as a speaker for some of Parker and Stone's more extreme commentary about society (three times he has dressed as Adolf Hitler). Cartman hates hippies more than anything else. This is seen in the episode \"Die Hippie, Die\" which showed his career as a 'hippie exterminator'.\nKenny comes from a poor family. He is the most cosmopolitan of the four boys, who often turn to him when encountering an unfamiliar sexual term. Kenny's voice is muffled by his parka. This is mainly because the comments he makes are vulgar. Even though his dialog is not understood by the viewer, Stan, Kyle and Cartman can understand him completely clearly enough.\nButters makes very few appearances in early episodes. He only started to became a regular character upon Kenny's death in season 6. He has since been used almost as regularly as the main four boys. Butters is the character that the others usually make fun of. He is nervous, naive, easily manipulated, yet he remains very optimistic. He is often punished by his overbearing parents, and sometimes used by his peers for their own amusement. Butters always gets grounded. To further represent Butters' unluckiness, it is revealed in the episode \"AWESOM-O\" that his birthday is on September 11. Butters became important after he was the replacement for the semi-permanently dead Kenny in season 6. He also has an alter ego which he named \"Professor Chaos\". His character is based on animation director Eric Stough.\nA female fourth grader, Stan's girlfriend and Bebe's best friend.\nFamily members.\n\"South Park\" has a number of different families, who represent a common theme of many episodes. There are five main families who are distinguished from the rest of the townsfolk: the Marshes (Stan's), the Broflovskis (Kyle's)(Jews), the Cartmans (Eric's), the McCormicks (Kenny's), and the Stotches (Butters'). These families are important because their children have been main characters.\nMarsh family.\nRandy Marsh has become one of the most common adult characters on the show. His actions in a lot of episodes, such as \"Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow\" and \"Bloody Mary\", suggest that Randy is rather foolish. Stan also says that his father is stupid in the episodes \"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\" and \"All About the Mormons?\". Like most adults in South Park, he has a tendency to get caught up in any trend. Randy is one of South Park's two geologists along with Clyde's father.\nSharon Marsh is Stan and Shelly Marsh's mother, as well as Randy Marsh's wife.\nShelly Marsh is Randy Marsh and Sharon Marsh's daughter and Stan Marsh's older sister.\nBroflovski family.\nSheila Broflovski is Kyle's mother.\nGerald is Kyle's father, and he works as a lawyer.\nPeter Gints, also known as Ike Moisha Broflovski, is Kyle's little brother. He was adopted by Gerald and Shiela. He was born in Canada.\nKyle T\u00f3mas Schwartz is Kyle's stereotypically Jewish cousin from Connecticut.\nCartman/Tenorman family.\nLiane Cartman is Eric's mother.\nJack Tenorman is Eric and Scott Tenorman's father. He is murdered in Season 5.\nScott is Jack's son and Eric's arch-enemy.\nTowelie.\nTowelie is a talking towel who smokes marijuana. He has a collection of novelty stamps. He often reminds the boys to bring a towel. \"Don't forget to bring a towel.\""}

Dictatorship is often called a \"cruel\" government, because it is considered most violent. \nThe word \"dictator\" is from the Roman Republic where a man would be given absolute power for half a year or one year to handle an emergency. Julius Caesar was the last Roman Dictator. \nSome dictators gained political power in a revolution. Some won an election and cancelled new elections once they took power.\nIt is not always clear whether a leader is a dictator or not. Some leaders got into power by elections, but sometimes they gave false election results.\nKings and emperors often use force and fear too, but usually they are not called dictators. This is because those monarchs have some reason for being in power (usually their father was king or emperor), but a dictator gained power himself. Also, when someone is king or emperor of a country, usually there were several kings or emperors before them. A dictator often creates the job of dictator by gaining power.\nSome people call leaders dictators because they simply do not like them and they seem powerful."}

It has a population of 188,500,000, more than any other country in Africa. Its capital is Abuja. Nigeria is known for being a large country, and one of the richest in Africa.\nHistory.\nFrom the 1500s to the 1800s, many people from the land now called Nigeria (and other parts of West Africa) were taken away and turned into slaves by Europeans, and they were sent to work in the Americas. These slaves were bought and sold in the Americas by Europeans who lived there. Today, many people related to those slaves still live in America, though they are no longer slaves. They are called African Americans.\nFrom 1901 to 1960, the United Kingdom ruled Nigeria. However, by 1960 the people wanted independence very much, and Britain finally let them have it. For some time after this, Nigeria was a dictatorship, where the leaders stayed in control even if the majority of people disliked them. At this time, Nigeria had a big war called the Biafro War with Christian Igbo people who wanted their own country in the East. They did not want to be a part of Nigeria, which was ruled by The Muslim North and Mixed West. The war ended with a reunification of Nigeria.\nIn 1999, Nigeria became a democracy, where people choose their leaders. After that, Olusegun Obasanjo, a Yoruba Christian from the south, became President. In 2007, Umaru Yar'Adua, a Hausa Muslim, was elected to be the next President. Yar'Adua died in May, 2009. Goodluck Jonathan, the vice president, then became president.\nGoodluck Jonathan was re-elected as the president after wining the 2011 general elections under the political party, PDP. \nHe served as the country's president until 2015. \nSince 2002, there have been a battles in the north of the country. The battles are between government troops and the Islamist group Boko Haram. This group wants to have Sharia law for the country.\nGeography.\nNigeria has a total area of . It is the world's 32nd-largest country. It shares a border with Benin (773\u00a0km), Niger (1497\u00a0km), Chad (87\u00a0km) and Cameroon (1690\u00a0km). It has a coastline of at least 853\u00a0km.\nThe highest point in Nigeria is Chappal Waddi at . The main rivers are the Niger and the Benue River. They come together and empty into the Niger Delta, one of the world's largest river deltas. It is the location of a large area of Central African Mangroves.\nCities.\nThese are the cities in Nigeria with over 1 million people as of 2012.\nNational anthem Of Nigeria.\nIn Nigeria, there are two national anthems. The first one is called \"Nigeria We Hail Thee\". The second and current national anthem is called \"Arise O' Compatriots. The first one was written by Lilian Jean William and composed by Frances Berda. The second one was written by 5 people and was composed by the Police band. Arise O' Compatriots was first heard during Nigeria's independence.\nReligion.\nIn Nigeria, there are almost equal numbers of Muslims and Christians. Most of the Christians live in the south, and most of the Muslims live in the north. Contrary to some beliefs, the Nigerian civil war was not only attributed to religious intolerance. The war which took place between 6 July 1967 \u2013 15 January 1970, was a political conflict caused by the attempted secession of the southeastern provinces of Nigeria as the self-proclaimed Republic of Biafra. The conflict was the result of economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria.\nNatural resources.\nNigeria produces a large amount of oil, and some fighting has been going on because many people want a share of the oil profits. This fighting has been happening in the area called the Niger Delta, where the Niger River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. \nThe largest city in Nigeria is Lagos. Nigeria has both grasslands and rainforests, and can get very hot, because it is close to the Equator. Petroleum and agriculture make up the Nigerian economy.\nCuisine.\nNigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, is known for its richness and variety. Many different spices, herbs and flavourings are used along with palm oil or groundnut oil. These make deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with chili peppers. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish. Good smelling market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied.\nSport.\nAssociation football is Nigeria's national sport. The country has its own Premier League of football. Nigeria's Men's national football team, known as the Super Eagles, has made the World Cup five times. These were in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2010, 2014, and most recently in 2018. They won the African Cup of Nations in 1980, 1994 and 2013. They also hosted the Junior World Cup. They won the gold medal for football in the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nNigeria is also involved in other sports such as basketball, cricket, sprints and track and field. Boxing is also an important sport in Nigeria; Dick Tiger and Samuel Peter are both former World Champions."}

It is frequently seen in the kitchens of northern East Africa. \nVariants.\nLaxoox bread is very similar to \"injera\", made in Ethiopian and Eritrea, but is much thinner and smaller in size. However, laxoox is always made with wheat flour, while the injera is made from teff (which can be made with flour of other cereals). \nPreparation.\nThe bread is made with a mixture of wheat flour, yeast, warm water and a small portion of salt. The mixture is stirred by hand until it becomes creamy and smooth, in this case is left to ferment in the evening. The laxoox is traditionally cooked in a circular metal plate called Daawa. Somalis living in exile, without access to a Daawa, use a normal pan instead. \nFlavor is often using melted butter or caramel. The Laxoox served with ful medames, scrambled egg, minced meat, beans, hummus, soup, camel milk, tea or Turkish. Generally it is sometimes eaten as a morning or afternoon lunch."}

They are often called the laughing hyena. They are found almost everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals, though their population is getting smaller in the wild. This is because of habitat loss and illegal hunting. They lived in Europe for at least a million years until the end of the Pleistocene.\nThe spotted hyena is the largest member of the Hyaenidae. They are the most social Carnivora animals, with various group sizes. Hyenas are pack hunters. Their behaviors are still not well understand. However, their social system is not cooperative but competitive. Females take care of their own cubs only, and males are not interested in helping females with their cubs. Females are larger than males and they can control them. The females are the only mammalian species not to have a vaginal opening.\nThe spotted hyena is a successful scavenger as well as hunter They can eat skin, bone and other animal waste. Spotted hyenas hunt with a family group of about two to five other hyenas. The family lives in large communities (called \"clans\") which may have up to 80 individuals.\nThey run around herds of animals and choose one to attack. After they have selected their prey, they chase them for a long time. They can run at speeds up to 60\u00a0km/h. Humans have known spotted hyenas for a long time. In the Upper Paleolithic, humans made paintings of hyenas in caves. Spotted hyenas have a negative reputation in Western culture and African folklore. In African folklore, spotted hyenas are described as ugly and scared animals. In Western culture, they are seen as greedy, stupid, foolish, powerful and a dangerous animal."}

When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the human body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis. This process breaks down the glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose which can then be used as an energy source. Insulin is a central metabolic control mechanism. Insulin is also used as a control signal to other body systems (such as amino acid uptake by body cells). In addition, it has several other anabolic effects throughout the body. Insulin affects vascular compliance and cognition.\nHuman insulin is a peptide hormone composed of 51 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 5808 Da. The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas produces insulin. The name comes from the Latin \"insula\" for \"island\". Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from different animal sources has different effects on the human carbohydrate metabolism process. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version. So, people with diabetes can take in insulin extracted from pigs instead of producing their own insulin.\nHistory.\nNicolae Paulescu, a Romanian professor of physiology at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, was the first to isolate insulin. He did that in 1916. He called it pancrein. He isolated it by developing an aqueous pancreatic extract which, when injected into a diabetic dog, proved to have a normalizing effect on blood sugar levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of World War I. In early 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in Bucharest and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he detailed his work by publishing an extensive whitepaper on the effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a diabetic animal, which he called: \"Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation\", with the paper received the 22 June 1921 by the \"Archives Internationales de Physiologie\", with the photocopy of the article available in the Gerstein Science Information Centre.https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AT10137\nDr. Frederick Banting, a general practician, who was also teaching orthopaedics and anthropology part-time at the University of Western Ontario in London at the time of Paulescu's published research regarding the already developed aqueous pancreatic extract and Charles Best, a 22-year-old medical student at the University of Toronto who worked at the time as an assistant to the surgeon Dr. Frederick Banting also did similar experiments while trying to find a cure for diabetes. In these experiments they used as well dogs.\nThey first knew insulin would control diabetes in a person when they injected some insulin into a 14-year-old boy named Leonard Thompson who was dying of diabetes. After the injection he survived. Banting won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with John Macleod, for the discovery of insulin. Best and Paulescu were not honored at that time.\nThe first genetically-engineered, synthetic \"human\" insulin was produced in a laboratory in 1977 by Herbert Boyer using E. coli."}
{"id": "34376", "revid": "54777", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34376", "title": "Dragon Ball Z", "text": " is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. It is the sequel to \"Dragon Ball\" and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter \"Dragon Ball\" manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" from 1984 to 1995. \"Dragon Ball Z\" aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 1989 to January 1996, before getting subtitled or dubbed in territories including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, India and Latin America. It was broadcast in at least 81countries worldwide. It is part of the \"Dragon Ball\" media franchise.\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" continues the adventures of Son Goku, who, along with his companions, defends the Earth against villains ranging from aliens (Vegeta, Frieza), androids (Cell) and magical creatures (Majin Buu). While the original \"Dragon Ball\" anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, \"Dragon Ball Z\" is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rivals, Piccolo and Vegeta.\nDue to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially released by Viz Media under the \"Dragon Ball Z\" title.\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" is adapted from the final 324 chapters of the manga series which were published in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" from 1988 to 1995. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.\nThroughout the production, the voice actors were tasked with playing different characters and performing their lines on cue, switching between roles as necessary.\nThe voice actors were unable to record the lines separately because of the close dialogue timing. When asked if juggling the different voices of Goku, Gohan and Goten were difficult, Masako Nozawa said that it was not and that she was able to switch roles simply upon seeing the character's picture. She did admit that when they were producing two films a year and television specials in addition to the regular series, there were times when they had only line art to look at while recording, which made giving finer nuanced details in her performance difficult.\nEnglish dub production and broadcasting.\nIn 1996, Funimation Productions licensed \"Dragon Ball Z\" for an English-language release in North America, after canceling their initial dub of \"Dragon Ball\" half-way through their originally-planned 26-episode first season. They worked with Saban Entertainment to syndicate the series on television, and Pioneer Entertainment to handle home video distribution. Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 (the end of the dub) and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version, but did not do so. They did, however, release uncut dubs of the first three \"Z\" movies on home video.\nIn 2005, Funimation began to re-dub episodes 1-67 with their in-house voice cast, including content originally cut from their dub with Saban. This dub's background score was composed by Nathan M. Johnson (Funimation had ceased working with Faulconer Productions after the final episode of \"Dragon Ball Z\" in 2003). Funimation's new uncut dub of these episodes aired on Cartoon Network as part of its Monday-Thursday late night time slot, beginning in June 2005. Funimation's later remastered DVDs of the series saw them redub portions of the dialogue, mostly after episode 67, and had the option to play the entire series' dub with both the American and Japanese background music.\nIn January 2011, Funimation and Toei announced that they would stream \"Dragon Ball Z\" within 30\u00a0minutes before their simulcast of \"One Piece\". As of 2017, \"Dragon Ball Z\" is no longer being streamed on Hulu.\nThe Funimation dubbed episodes also aired in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand. However, beginning with episode 108 (123 uncut), Westwood Media (in association with Ocean Studios) produced an alternate English dub, distributed to Europe by AB Groupe. The alternate dub was created for broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland, although it also aired in Canada beginning from episode 168 (183 uncut) to fulfill Canadian content requirements. Funimation's in-house dub continued to air in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. The Westwood Media production used the same voice cast from the original 53-episode dub produced by Funimation, it featured an alternate soundtrack by Tom Keenlyside and John Mitchell, though most of this score was pieces Ocean reused from other productions Keenlyside and Mitchell had scored for them, and it used the same scripts and video master as the TV edit of Funimation's in-house dub. The Westwood Media dub never received a home video release. In Australia, \"Dragon Ball Z\" was broadcast by the free-to-air commercial network, Network Ten during morning children's programming, Cheez TV, originally using the censored Funimation/Saban dub before switching to Funimation's in-house dub.\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" originally aired on the British Comedy Network in Fall 1998. \"The Independent\" (London), March 5, 2000.\nEditing.\n\"Dragon Ball Z\"s original North American release was the subject of heavy editing which resulted in a large amount of removed content and alterations that greatly changed the original work. Funimation CEO Gen Fukunaga is often criticized for his role in the editing; but it was the initial distributor Saban which required such changes or they would not air the work, as was the case with the episode dealing with orphans.\nSteven Simmons, who did the subtitling for Funimation's home video releases, offered commentary on the subtitling from a project and technical standpoint, addressing several concerns. The typographical errors in the script were caused by dashes (\u2014) and double-quotes (\") failing to appear, which resulted in confusing dialogue.\nMusic.\nShunsuke Kikuchi composed the score for \"Dragon Ball Z\". The opening theme for the first 199 episodes is \"Cha-La Head-Cha-La\" performed by Hironobu Kageyama. The second opening theme used up until the series finale at episode 291 is \"We Gotta Power\" also performed by Kageyama. The ending theme used for the first 199 episodes is performed by MANNA.\nHome media.\nIn Japan, \"Dragon Ball Z\" did not receive a home video release until 2003, seven years after its broadcast. This was a remastering of the series in two 26-disc DVD box sets, that were made-to-order only, released on March 19 and September 18 and referred to as \"Dragon Boxes.\" The content of these sets began being released on mass-produced individual 6-episode DVDs on November 2, 2005, and finished with the 49th volume released on February 7, 2007.\nThe international home release structure of \"Dragon Ball Z\" is complicated by the licensing and release of the companies involved in producing and distributing the work. Releases of the media occurred on both VHS and DVD with separate edited and uncut versions being released simultaneously. Both versions of the edited and uncut material are treated as different entries and would frequently make \"Billboard\" rankings as separate entries. Home release sales were featured prominently on the Nielsen VideoScan charts. Further complicating the release of the material was Funimation itself; which was known to release \"DVDs out of sequence in order to get them out as fast as possible\"; as in the case of their third season. Pioneer Entertainment distributed the Funimation/Saban edited-only dub of 53 episodes on seventeen VHS between 1997 and 1999, and seventeen DVDs throughout 1999. Two box sets separating them into the Saiyan and Namek arcs were also released on VHS in 1999, and on DVD in 2001. Funimation's own distribution of their initial onward dub, which began with episode 54, in edited or uncut VHS ran between 1999 and 2006. A DVD version was produced alongside these, although they were only produced uncut and contained the option to watch the original Japanese with subtitles.\nIn 2005, Funimation began releasing their onward dub of the beginning of \"Dragon Ball Z\" on DVD, marking the first time the episodes were seen uncut in North America. However, only nine volumes were released, leaving it incomplete. Instead, Funimation remastered and cropped the entire series into 16:9 widescreen format and began re-releasing it to DVD in nine individual \"season\" box sets; the first set released on February 6, 2007 and the final on May 19, 2009. In July 2009, Funimation announced that they would be releasing the Japanese frame-by-frame \"Dragon Box\" restoration of \"Dragon Ball Z\" in North America. These seven limited edition collector's DVD box sets were released uncut in the show's original 4:3 fullscreen format between November 10, 2009 and October 11, 2011.\nIn March 2019, Funimation announced plans to release a 30th anniversary Blu-ray release of \"Dragon Ball Z\", with the box set being remastered in 4:3 aspect ratio, and containing an art book and a collectible figure. It would be crowdfunded, originally requiring a minimum of 2500 pre-orders in order to be manufactured, but was later increased to a minimum of 3,000 units. The release sparked controversy amongst fans due to the framing of the video, color saturation, and digital video noise reduction. Funimation responded by stating that they cropped the release by going in \"scene-by-scene to make judgments based on the image available in each frame of how much to trim to get to a consistent 4:3 aspect ratio, while still attempting to cut a little out of the picture as possible,\" and that they felt the digital video noise reduction was \"mandatory for this release based on the different levels of fan support from various past DBZ releases with different levels of noise reduction over the years.\nThe \"Dragon Ball Z\" films comprise a total of 15 entries as of 2015. The first 13 films were typically released every March and July during the series' original run in accordance with the spring and summer vacations of Japanese schools. They were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. These films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. All 15 films were licensed in North America by Funimation, and all have received in-house dubs by the company. Prior to Funimation, the third film was a part of the short-lived Saban syndication, being split into three episodes, and the first three films received uncut English dubs in 1998 produced by Funimation with Ocean Studios and released by Pioneer. Several of the films have been broadcast on Cartoon Network and Nicktoons in the United States, Toonami UK in the United Kingdom (these featured an alternate English dub produced by an unknown cast by AB Groupe), and Cartoon Network in Australia.\nTelevision specials and original video animations.\nThree TV specials based on \"Dragon Ball Z\" were produced and broadcast on Fuji TV. The first two were ' in 1990 and ' in 1993, the latter being based on a special chapter of the original manga. Both were licensed by Funimation in North America and AB Groupe in Europe. In 2013, a two-part hour-long crossover with \"One Piece\" and \"Toriko\", titled \"Dream 9 Toriko &amp; One Piece &amp; Dragon Ball Z Ch\u014d Collaboration Special!!\", was created and aired.\nAdditionally, two original video animations (OVAs) bearing the \"Dragon Ball Z\" title have been made. The first is ', which was originally released in 1993 in two parts as \"Official Visual Guides\" for the video game of the same title. ' was a 2010 remake of this OVA. None of the OVAs have been dubbed into English, and the only one to see a release in North America is the 2010 remake, which was subtitled and included as a bonus feature in \"\".\nVideo games.\nThere are over 57 video games bearing the \"Dragon Ball Z\" name across a range of platforms from the Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom to the current generation consoles. Also included are arcade games like \"Super Dragon Ball Z\", which would eventually be ported to consoles.\nIn North America, licensing rights had been given to both Namco Bandai and Atari. In 1999, Atari acquired exclusive rights to the video games through Funimation, a deal which was extended for five more years in 2005. A 2007 dispute would end with Atari paying Funimation $3.5 million. In July 2009, Namco Bandai was reported to have obtained exclusive rights to release the games for a period of five years. This presumably would have taken effect after Atari's licensing rights expired at the end of January 2010.\nSoundtracks.\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" has been host to numerous soundtrack releases with works like \"Cha-La Head-Cha-La\" and a series of 21 soundtracks released as part of the \"Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection Series\". In total, dozens of releases exist for \"Dragon Ball Z\" which includes Japanese and foreign adapted releases of the anime themes and video game soundtracks.\nReception.\nIn Asia, the \"Dragon Ball Z\" franchise, including the anime and merchandising, earned a profit of $3billion by 1999. In the United States, the series sold over 25million DVDs as of January 2012. Dragon Ball fans set a Guinness World Record for Largest Kamehameha attack move at San Diego Comic con on July 17, 2019.\nCultural impact and legacy.\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's \"Top 100 Animated Series\", and was also listed as the 50th greatest animated show in \"Wizard\" magazine's \"Top 100 Greatest Animated shows\" list. The series ranked #6 on \"Wizard's Anime\" Magazine on their \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\".\n\"Dragon Ball Z\"s popularity is reflected through a variety of data through online interactions which show the popularity of the media. In 2001, it was reported that the official website of \"Dragon Ball Z\" recorded 4.7 million hits per day and included 500,000+ registered fans. The term \"Dragonball Z\" ranked 4th in 1999 and 2nd in 2000 by Lycos' web search engine. For 2001, \"Dragonball\" was the most popular search on Lycos and \"Dragonball Z\" was fifth on Yahoo!.\nIn 2005, media historian Hal Erickson wrote that \"\"Dragon Ball\" may be the closest thing on American television to an animated soap opera \u2014 though this particular genre is an old, established and venerated one in Japan, the series' country of origin.\nMerchandising.\n\"Dragon Ball Z\" merchandise was a success prior to its peak American interest, with more than $3 billion in sales from 1996 to 2000. In 1996, \"Dragon Ball Z\" grossed $2.95billion in merchandise sales worldwide. As of January 2012, \"Dragon Ball Z\" grossed $5billion in merchandise sales worldwide.\nIn 1998, Animage-ine Entertainment, a division of Simitar, announced the sale of Chroma-Cels, mock animation cels to capitalize on the popularity of \"Dragon Ball Z\". The original sale was forecasted for late 1998, but were pushed back to January 12, 1999.\nIn December 2002, Jakks Pacific signed a three-year deal for licensing \"Dragon Ball Z\" toys, which was possible because of the bankruptcy of Irwin Toy. Jakks Pacific's \"Dragon Ball Z\" 5-inch figures were cited as impressive for their painting and articulation.\nIn 2010, Toei closed deals in Central and South American countries which included Algazarra, Richtex, Pil Andina, DTM, Doobalo and Bondy Fiesta. In 2012, Brazil's Abr-Art Bag Rio Comercio Importacao e Exportacao closed a deal with Toei."}

For a long time, this was thought to be intermale competition, but closer observation has shown it is usually a female hitting a male to prevent copulation.

There is a group of 6 islands to the north, then there is a waterway of 3\u00a0km, then there is another group to the south. There is a weather station in one of the islands. The islands are an important nesting place for birds.\nThe islands belong to Chile, and are named after Diego Ram\u00edrez. They were first sighted on 12 February 1619 by Marco Ramirez of the Garcia de Nodal expedition, and named after the cosmographer of the expedition. They were the southernmost landmass known at the time. They kept this status for 156 years. In 1775, James Cook discovered the South Sandwich Islands, which are much farther south.\nThe Chilean Navy built a meteorological station above \"Caleta Condell\", a small cove on the northeast side of \"Isla Gonzalo\" (Gonzalo Island), in 1957, and resupply it several times each year. This is the southernmost manned outpost of South America (including islands), even if the South Sandwich Islands are regarded as part of South America. The Argentinian station on Thule Island was taken down in June 1982 after the Falklands War. The next southerly manned outpost of South America is the lighthouse of Cape Horn. Cruise ships sometimes pass by on their way to and from Antarctica.\nThe archipelago has 2 groups. The North group is smaller and is named as \"Rocas del Norte\". There are 5 islands in this group, \"Islote Cabezas\", \"Islote Pe\u00f1ailillo\", \"Isla Norte\", \"Islote Mart\u00ednez\" and \"Islote Mendoza\". In the South group are many islands, for example; \"Islote Santander\", \"Islotes Vergara\", \"Isla Bartolom\u00e9\" (the principal island), \"Islote Pontevedra\", \"Islote Garc\u00eda\", \"Isla Gonzalo\" (the second longest) and \"Islote Ester\".\nAll the islands have moss on the ground, and they have a cold climate all year, with much rain every month.

When someone has learned to play a piece of music well enough to perform it, it is good if they can learn to play it without the printed music. This is called \u201cplaying from memory\u201d or \u201cplaying by heart\u201d. When a musician is practising a piece of music so that it can be played from memory this is called memorizing the music.\nMost Classical musicians will agree that it is good to play from memory when performing as a soloist. It means that the player understands the music really well, and he is able to concentrate completely on the way he plays the music (the interpretation). In some music competitions the competitors are expected to play from memory. A pianist playing a recital will usually play everything from memory. It is particularly important for singers who are performing songs (Lieder) to sing without music because they can then communicate directly with the audience using the expression on their faces. Some conductors conduct from memory. If they do, they ought to know every single note for every single instrument from memory. There are some conductors who have such amazing memories that they can do this.\nSome people find it easier to memorize music than others. There are different ways of practising to help memorize music: by memorizing a few bars at a time, by studying the printed music away from the instrument, or by \u201cthinking\u201d through the piece away from the instrument.\nSome people have a \u201cphotographic memory\u201d and can see in their mind the music as printed on the paper. Some people rely on aural memory (hearing it in one\u2019s imagination). There is also muscular memory (the fingers \"knowing\" what to do). Probably most people use some combination of all these methods.\nWhen people perform from memory they are often worried that they might have a memory lapse (forget how the music goes). It can happen, of course, even to the greatest musicians. The famous violinist Bronislaw Huberman and the pianist Eugen d\u2019Albert were once performing Beethoven\u2019s \"Kreutzer Sonata\". Both were playing from memory. One of them kept going wrong in the same place, playing something that had happened earlier, so that they played the middle bit three times before eventually managing to finish the piece. However, this is quite common, and can happen to anyone. \nPeople who learn musical instruments should try to memorize some of their pieces. Many famous musicians have a large repertoire (a collection) of pieces that they can play from memory.\nSources.\n\"Pianoforte Diplomas\" by Geoffrey Tankard (Sevenoaks 1973)"}

To use the system, one had to put one's face close to the system so that each eye could see only one screen. By showing each eye a different image, the system could create a 3D effect.\nThe way the system displayed images was not by LCDs, as some would think. At the time, LCDs could not be used because they had two problems when they were first tested on the console: they would blur if anything moved on the screen, and users would see double instead of depth. Instead, a vertical line of 224 very bright, but very small, LEDs were used for each eye. These LEDs flashed on and off very fast in certain patterns. This line of LEDs was then magnified by a lens, and a vibrating mirror would reflect each line at a certain time into each eye, creating a full image due to the human eye's persistence of vision. Unfortunately, due to the quick flashing of the LEDs, many users felt sick, became dizzy, or had headaches after playing for a long time. To help this, an \"automatic pause\" feature was added, which stopped the game play every 30 minutes for the player to rest his or her eyes.\nThe Virtual Boy was first sold in 1995, but was not popular. Consumers did not like the console's high price, monochrome graphics, eye and neck strain, and need for a stand. Many were saving money for the soon-to-be-sold Nintendo 64. Nintendo lowered the price many times, but the system did not sell well and was discontinued (Nintendo stopped making them) in 1996. Only 22 games were released in Japan and North America. Virtual Boy sold 770,000 units.\nPopular games for the system include \"Mario Tennis\" and \"Virtual Boy Wario Land\" (Known as \"Wario Cruise\" in Japan).\nThe Virtual Boy was made by Gunpei Yokoi, who also made the Game Boy and \"Game &amp; Watch\".\nPeople rumored that Gunpai Yakoi made the Virtual Boy as a parting gift, but unfortunately it failed.\nThere was a Japan version of the Virtual Boy, (Family Computer 3-D System) it played in color and indeed, played in 3-D."}

{"id": "34513", "revid": "103847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34513", "title": "Existentialism", "text": "Existentialism is a way of thinking that focuses on what it means for people to exist. It is a philosophical movement. It became well-known in books and movies of the 19th and 20th centuries. Existentialism is known for dealing with nihilistic problems, but is generally still a kind of . It says that humans have will and consciousness, but they live in a world that does not. The premise that people must make choices about their life while knowing they are mortal is what existentialism is all about.\nIt was started by the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (18131855).\nKierkegaard was a very religious man, but existentialism in the 20th century became more and more atheistic. Most of its main thinkers and writers were in mainland Europe. For example, Jean-Paul Sartre spent most of the Second World War in a German prison camp, reading the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. When he came out he gave a lecture called \"Existentialism and Humanism\". This early lecture may be easier to read than his later work.\nMany religions and philosophies (ways of thinking about the world) say that human life has a meaning (or a purpose). But people who believe in existentialism think that the world and human life have \"no meaning unless people give them meaning\": \u2018existence precedes [is before] essence\u2019. This means that we find ourselves existing in the world, and then we give ourselves meaning, or 'essence'. As Sartre said, \"We are condemned to be free\". This means that we have no choice but to choose, and that we have full responsibility for our choices. Another way to put it is that we are always making choices even if we don't realize it.\nExistentialists believe that our human 'essence' or 'nature' (way of being in the world) is simply our 'existence' (being in the world). More simply put, the 'essence' of a human, or what makes a human a 'human', is not due to nature or uncontrollable circumstances; rather, human essence is really just what we choose to make it. This means that the only nature we as humans have is the nature we make for ourselves. As a result of this, existentialists think that the actions or choices that a person makes are very important. They believe that every person has to decide for themselves what is right and wrong, and what is good and bad.\nPeople who believe in existentialism ask questions like \u2019what is it like to be a human (a person) in the world?\u2019 and \u2019how can we understand human freedom (what it means for a person to be free)?\u2019 Existentialism is often connected with negative emotions, such as anxiety (worrying), dread (a very strong fear), and mortality (awareness of our own death). Some existentialists, like Sartre and Heidegger, think that thinking about these emotions helps people to choose the way that they want to live their lives.\nExistentialism is sometimes confused with nihilism. It is different from nihilism, but there is a similarity. Nihilists believe that human life \"does not\" have a meaning (or a purpose) at all; existentialism says that people must choose their own purpose.\nExistentialism in books.\nMany of the main sources for existentialism were written in other languages and only later translated, mostly after the 1950s.\nExistentialism in movies.\nIngmar Bergman made a movie called \"The Seventh Seal\" in 1957. It shows the doom and gloom of the late Middle Ages caused by the Black Plague, famine, the Hundred Years' War between France and England, and papal schism. \nThe movie \"Taxi Driver\" (which has the actor Robert De Niro) from 1976 has existential ideas in it. The main character feels sad and lonely, because he cannot understand the world.\nJean-Luc Godard's \"Vivre sa vie (film)\" and Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 are prime examples of the Existentialism fashion in the European early 50's that influenced American films such as Easy Rider or The Graduate in the 1960s.\n is a 2004 film directed by . The movie revolves around a man who hires two existential detectives to find out about his \"coincidence.\" He meets his \"other\" and is tempted with the dark side of existentialism."}

Sometimes the concept is called \"state machine\". It is like an abstract machine. \nSuch a machine can be given \"input\", which is either rejected, or accepted. It's like a vending machine. When something is bought, coins (or money) needs to be inserted into the machine. If these are the right coins, they are accepted, and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed. If the coins are wrong, they are rejected.\nInternally, the automaton has different \"states\" it can be in. Feeding it input may (or may not) change its state. That way, the automaton goes through all the input, consuming one item (which mathematicians call a symbol) at a time. When no symbol is left, the automaton is in a certain state. This may be an \"final state\". In this case the input is accepted. Otherwise, the input is rejected.\nIf the machine has a countable, finite number of states, it is called \"finite state machine\". A diagram that shows all the states, and transitions of such a machine is called finite state diagram.\nProblems.\nLike in real life, there are machines that are too complex to understand. The mathematician and computer scientists therefore ask themselves if a certain automaton is \"minimal\". If it is not minimal, there must be another automaton with fewer states that can do the same thing. An example of an automaton is the Turing machine."}

Vending machine foods include snacks such as potato chips, chocolate bars, and candy. Hot vending machine drinks include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Cold vending machine drinks include juice, bottled water, soft drinks. Other merchandise includes newspapers or cigarettes. Vending machines in bathrooms sometimes sell condoms, mouthwash, or toothpaste and toothbrushes. \nThe machines usually work, when some money (usually coins or paper money) is put in a slot. Then, a button needs to be pushed, or a lever pulled. If there is enough money, the selected item will be dropped to a tray, where it can be taken out by the person making the purchase. Ticket vending machines will print the ticket. Older vending machines were all mechanical, but most newer ones are partly electronic. Many modern vending machines can accept debit or credit cards in addition to cash.\nThe first vending machine came about during 1st century AD from Roman Egypt and was invented by the Roman mathematician and engineer, Hero of Alexandria. The vending machine was invented to dispense a certain amount of holy water, so that the people of the city don\u2019t take much of it from the temple. Hero of Alexandria actually created a device in which people could drop tokens to release a certain amount of water.\nIn 1615, the England created a small machine that dispensed tobacco which were placed in taverns. In 1822, Richard Carlile, an English bookseller and publisher, created a machine that dispensed banned works, thus, allowing readers to purchase them. During the 1850s and 60s, the first, fully-automatic vending machine was introduced which sold stamps and writing paper. By the 1880s, coin-operated vending machines were introduced in London and Percival Everitt invented a machine that dispensed envelopes, postcards and notepapers. In 1887, Sweetmeat Automatic Delivery Company set up multiple vending machines in England, which sold chocolates, chewing gums, perfumes and matches. In 1888, United States of America had its first vending machine, set up by the Thomas Adams Gum Company, which sold tutti-frutti gum. In 1907, one of the early models of the modern-day gumball dispensing machines came out. Through the 1940s and 1950s, soda-vending machines also became popular. Due to this, Coca-Cola immensely increased their sales and currently, has one of the largest number of vending machines in the world.\nJapan has a reputation for having some of the most innovative uses of automated vending, providing machines that offer fresh fruits and vegetables, sake, hot foods, batteries, flowers, clothing and, of course, sushi.

For many years, it was a major milestone on the clipper route by which sailing ships carried trade around the world. The waters around the cape are very dangerous because of strong winds, large waves, and icebergs. These reasons have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard.\nToday, the Panama Canal has greatly reduced the need for cargo ships to travel via the Horn. However, sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting, and a number of recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe. Several prominent ocean yacht races, notably the Vend\u00e9e Globe, sail around the world via the Horn, and speed records for round-the-world sailing follow the same route."}

They are generally found in cold water near the North or South Pole. Icebergs are especially common during spring, when ice has begun to melt. About 90% of an iceberg is below the water line and ten percent above. Just by looking at the part you can see, it is hard to tell how the part underwater looks, and how close you can get before crashing into it.\nIcebergs break off from larger structures made of ice, like glaciers or ice shelves. These are formed by snowfall in very cold places where it will not melt in the summer. The snow builds up and compacts into ice. This is gradually pulled downhill by gravity and into the sea. The ice then falls off and makes icebergs. The icebergs can drift in the sea for years before they have melted completely.\nHistory.\nThe first person to give a correct scientific explanation of this phenomenon was Mikhail Lomonosov, around 1750. The density of ice is about 0.92 kg per liter, that of sea water is about 1.025 kg per liter. For this reason, 920 parts of the 1025, or about 90 percent, of the iceberg's volume need to be below the water line. Lomonosov grew up on the shore of the White Sea in the European part of Russia. He studied in Marburg, and is credited with introducing the word \"iceberg\" into the Russian language.\nIcebergs are very dangerous to ships, and many ships have sunk after crashing into icebergs. The most famous one was RMS \"Titanic\" in 1912.\nThe largest iceberg people know about was called B-15. It broke off from the Antarctic ice shelf in the year 2000, and was as large as the island of Jamaica (over 10,000\u00a0km2). It soon started to break up into smaller pieces, some of which still remain in 2008.\nIcebergs are affected by global warming."}

It forms because the snow in an area does not all melt in summer. Each winter, more snow is added. The weight of all the snow creates pressure. This pressure turns the lower parts of the snow into ice. After this happens for many years, the glacier will start growing large. It becomes so heavy that gravity causes the ice to move. It flows downwards like water but very slowly. A glacier only moves about per year. New snowfalls replace the parts that flow away.\nGlaciers are the largest sources of fresh water on Earth. The largest bodies of salt water are the Oceans\nCreation.\nGlaciers will only form in places that are cold enough and get enough snow over time. This can take a long time. It often takes tens or hundreds of years for a glacier to form. There are two kinds of glaciers: \"continental glaciers\" and \"alpine glaciers\". Alpine glaciers are also called \"mountain glaciers\".\nEffects.\nGlaciers are very important. They have a large effect on the environment. They do this because they are very large and heavy. When they move, they erode mountains and land. Also, since they froze long ago, snow crystals and air bubbles inside are kept in good condition. These can provide a large amount of information for scientists. Recently glaciers have been melting more than they did in the past. Many scientists think this is happening because global warming is changing the climate.\nAppearance.\nGlaciers are blue in color. This is because water is very good at absorbing light. Only the strongest light, with the most energy, is able to escape. Blue is the color of light that has the most energy. Because of this, blue is the only color of light that can escape without being absorbed. The thicker the glacier is, the more blue it appears."}

Before anyone had thought of a toothbrush, people kept their teeth clean by chewing on a stick until one end got soft and frayed like a brush. Sometimes they dipped a finger in chalk or salt and then rubbed their teeth. Toothpicks were another way to take care of teeth, and toothpicks were very fancy then.

The prison guard gave him some bristles. Joseph tied the bristles into little bundles, cut them to make them even, put glue on the ends, and stuffed them into the holes.

In biology, it is the keeping of a stable internal environment.\nHomeostasis is life's ability to stay balanced, when the environment changes. Animals keep their body in a stable condition. They do so by regulating their inner equilibrium . For example, they adjust their pH, temperature, amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the blood and so on. In living things, the study of how they keep in a stable condition is called physiology. Mostly, our physiology works unconsciously throughout life. We have many negative feedback systems which adjust our physiology so that we stay alive. These systems are self-organising and do not need to be learnt. They are inherited.\nThe concept was described by Claude Bernard, and the term was later coined by Walter Cannon in 1926, 1929, and 1932. Walter Cannon thought these were the features of homeostasis:\nExamples of homeostasis:\nIn mammals, the main organs involved with homeostasis are:\nThe brain is also central to homeostasis. It controls behaviour, and the basic function of behaviour is to support life by taking action."}

It is usually caused by a blood clot that starts somewhere else in the body and travels to the lungs. However, it can also be caused by clumped cancer cells, fat, or bone. Rarely, while giving birth, a woman can get a clot of amniotic fluid.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of a pulmonary embolism start suddenly, as soon as the clot starts blocking blood flow to the lungs. Blood is supposed to pick up oxygen in the lungs and then carry that oxygen to the rest of the body. If blood cannot get through to the lungs, it cannot pick up oxygen or deliver it to the body. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive.\nOften, the first sign of a pulmonary embolism is syncope (fainting), because the brain is not getting enough blood and oxygen. Other symptoms include:\nSaddle embolus.\nThe worst kind of pulmonary embolism is caused by a \"saddle embolus\". This kind of embolus blocks the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. This makes it impossible for any blood to get through to the lungs. Since no blood can get out to the rest of the body, the person's blood pressure drops and they can go into shock. A saddle embolus is a very serious medical emergency. Many people with this type of embolus die.\nRisk factors.\nThere are many risk factors that make it more likely for a person to get a pulmonary embolism. For example:\nTreatment.\nThere are a few treatments for pulmonary embolism. The choice of which treatments to use depends on how serious the pulmonary embolism is. Treatments include:"}

Most toilets use water and to flush the waste through plumbing into a sewage system. However, some modern toilets do not use water, and are called dry toilets.\nA room that has a toilet can be called a \"restroom\" or \"bathroom\" in the United States. In other places it may be called the toilet or the water closet (WC).\nToilets in homes.\nAlmost all modern buildings have at least one toilet. In the home, a toilet may or may not be in the same room as a shower or a bathtub. Some toilets are outside, in an \"outhouse\".\nIn developing countries, many people do not have a toilet in their home. More than 4.5 billion people do not have access to toilets.\nPublic toilets.\nA public toilet may or may not cost money to use. Toilets that cost money are called \"pay toilets\".\nPublic bathrooms often have many toilets with walls between them. This makes areas called \"stalls\" (US) or \"cubicles\" (UK). Bathrooms for men often also have separate urinals. Urinals can either be on the wall for a single user, or a basin or trough for many men to use at the same time. Urinals on walls sometimes have small walls or dividers for privacy reasons.\nOutdoor public toilets (in the street, around parks, etc.) are a form of street furniture. These toilets are in individual cubicles. Some are simple and have little or no plumbing. Others are less simple, and some toilets even clean themselves after every use.\nSome toilet-cubicles are mobile and can be put in place where and when they are needed. These toilets are called \"portable toilets\". Portable toilets are commonly used at large outdoor events like concerts, festivals or carnivals.\nInventions.\nEvery day, toilets use 141 billion liters of water to flush waste, so scientists try to make toilets that do not need so much water. In 2019, one group made a chemical to put onto toilets to make them very slippery so that the waste flushes away with only a little water. The scientists hope their invention will be used by many people one day."}

It is one of the most easily recognized dinosaurs, with its distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates on its back, and the long spikes on its tail. The armor was necessary as it lived with such meat-eaters as \"Allosaurus\" and \"Ceratosaurus\".\nDiscovery and species.\n\"Stegosaurus\" was originally named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877, from fossils found near Morrison, Colorado. These first bones became the first species of Stegosaur named: \"Stegosaurus armatus\".\nSeveral different \"Stegosaurus\" species have been found.\nPaleobiology.\n\"Stegosaurus\" was the largest stegosaur, reaching up to 12\u00a0m (39.4\u00a0ft) in length and weighing up to 5,000\u00a0kg (5.5\u00a0short tons). However, 7 to 9\u00a0m was a more usual length.\nSkull.\nThe skull of \"Stegosaurus\" was long and narrow. Because of its short front legs, its head was close to the ground, probably no higher than 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft). It ate low-growing plants because of this. It had no front teeth, but it did have a horn-covered beak. Stegosaurian chewing teeth were small and triangular and did little grinding as they lacked wear surfaces.\nUnlike most dinosaurs, it did not have a lacuna (hole) in its skull between the nose and eye.\nNervous system.\nIt has often been said that the \"Stegosaurus\" brain was the size of a walnut. Actually, it had a brain several times the size of a walnut. The bundle of nerves near the base of the tail that controlled reflexes in the back of the body was larger than the brain and is sometimes said to be a \"second brain\". These issues are discussed in Dinosaur brains and intelligence.\nPosture.\n\"Stegosaurus\" had very short forelimbs in relation to its hind legs. The back legs each had three short toes, while the front legs had five toes. All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes.\nClassification.\n\"Stegosaurus\" was a member of the Thyreophora, or armored dinosaurs, a family of dinosaurs which includes the ankylosaurs.\nPopular culture.\n\"Stegosaurus\" has been declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado. It has also appeared in many movies and TV shows."}

With plainchant, all people sing the same music in unison, most of the time. Sometimes, there is a second part, called \"organum\", which often uses the same melody, but at an interval. This interval is often a fourth or a fifth.\nHow it developed.\nGregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, but people wrote new songs and changed the old ones later. Many people believe an old story, which says that Pope Gregory the Great wrote the songs. Most people who study the history of music believe that kings such as Charlemagne brought music from Rome to their kingdoms in France and Germany. When Charlemagne's people sang these songs, they changed the songs. This new music became Gregorian chant.\nUsually men and boys sang Gregorian chant in churches, and holy women and men sang Gregorian chants in their daily prayers. In Roman Catholic churches, prayers and songs follow an order called the \"Roman Rite.\" Gregorian chant is the music used in the \"Mass\" and the \"Office\" of the Roman Rite. The \"Mass\" is the part of the Roman Rite where Catholics receive what they believe to be the body and blood of Christ. The \"Office\" is the part of the Roman Rite where holy men and women pray at special times every day. In the past, people sang different songs in parts of Europe, but Gregorian chant replaced almost all of them. Although the Roman Catholic Church no longer requires people to sing Gregorian chants, it still says that Gregorian chant is the best music for prayer.\nChristians have sung songs without music since the earliest days of the Church. Before the mid-1990s, many people believed that the Jewish songs called the \"Psalms,\" which are in both the Jewish and Christian Bible, were an important part of early Christian music and prayer. People who study the history of music and religion no longer believe this, because most early Christian songs were not from the Psalms, and Jews did not sing Psalms for many centuries after their most important holy place, the Second Temple, was destroyed in the year 70. However, some parts of Jewish music and prayer ended up later in Gregorian chant. The organized order of prayers called \"canonical hours\" come from Jewish tradition. The words \"amen\" and \"alleluia\" come from the Hebrew language. The prayer \"sanctus, sanctus, sanctus,\" which means \"holy, holy, holy,\" comes from the Jewish prayer \"kadosh, kadosh, kadosh.\"\nThe New Testament, tells how Jesus and his friends sang together: \"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives\" (Matthew|26.30). Other writers from those early centuries such as Pope Clement I also said that Christians sang religious songs, but they don\u2019t tell us what the music sounded like. The \"Oxyrhynchus hymn,\" a 3rd-century song from Greece has lasted with written musical notes, we do not know if this song is connected to plainchant.\nThe sorts of songs, which Catholics later sang in the Roman Rite, started to appear in the 3rd century. The \"Apostolic Tradition\", a book about Christian traditions in early Rome, says that Christians sang \"Alleluia\" in early holy meals called \"\"agape\" feasts.\" Chants of the Office started in the early 4th century, when holy men in the deserts started the tradition of singing all 150 psalms every week. Sometime around 375, Christians in Eastern Europe started singing religious songs back and forth between two groups; in 386, St. Ambrose brought this tradition to Western Europe. Singing back and forth is called \"antiphonal\" singing.\nMost people think that the liturgy of the Roman Mass was put together during the 7th century. In 785-786 Pope Hadrian I sent some Roman chants to the court of Charlemagne. Later this music developed into the system of eight modes. This music, together with some new chants to complete the liturgical year, became known as \"Gregorian.\" This chant was probably named after Pope Gregory the Great.\nWhen Charlemagne had become Holy Roman Emperor he made everyone in Europe use this Gregorian chant. By the 12th and 13th centuries all other kinds of chant disappeared, even the Roman form (now known as Old Roman chant).\nTypes.\nGregorian chants are divided into three types based on the number of notes sung to each syllable. \"Syllabic\" chants mostly have one note per syllable. In \"neumatic\" chants there are mostly two or three notes per syllable, while \"melismatic\" chants have lots of notes for one syllable. Some of the chants are recitative and some are free melody. When two choirs stand in different parts of the church and sing alternately these are called \"Antiphonal chants\". \"Responsorial chants\" are ones with a refrain sung by the choir, which alternate with a psalm verse sung by a soloist.\nGregorian chant used the eight modes which came from the Byzantine chants. They were written down in a special musical notation called \"neumes\". These neumes do not show the exact rhythms, so that we cannot always be sure of the way they were sung. The rhythm was probably quite free and flexible. There were certainly no bar lines and regular beat. The chant was normally sung by men. Women only sang in convents, and even then they could not sing in all the services.\nGregorian chant was a big influence on polyphonic music in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. When the original plainsong melody was made to be the bottom part it became known as \"cantus firmus\" (i.e. the \"given melody\"). Cantus firmus became a very important part of musical composition in the Renaissance."}

They were the first to use their new 'NT' (New Technology) core. That means it had a brand new core to do more things than the MS-DOS-based one that they used in older versions of Windows. Also, it was more secure and crashed less. Windows NT 3.1 was released as alpha versions in 1991-1992 and beta versions in 1993.\nHistory.\nMicrosoft decided to create a portable operating system, compatible with OS/2 and POSIX and supporting multiprocessing, in October 1988. When development started in November 1989, Windows NT was to be known as OS/2 3.0, the third version of the operating system developed jointly by Microsoft and IBM. To ensure portability, initial development was targeted at the Intel i860XR RISC processor, switching to the MIPS R3000 in late 1989, and then the Intel i386 in 1990.\nIt is well believed that Dave Cutler intended the initialism 'WNT' as a pun on VMS, incrementing each letter by one. However, the project was named NT OS/2 before receiving the Windows brand. One of the original OS/2 3.0 creators, Mark Lucovsky, claims that the name was taken from the original target processor\u2014the Intel i860, code-named N10 ('N-Ten'). Various Microsoft publications, including a 1998 question-and-answer session with Bill Gates, reveal that the letters were expanded to 'New Technology' for marketing purposes but no longer carry any specific meaning. The letters were dropped from the name of Windows 2000, though Microsoft described the product as 'Built on NT technology.'\nVersions of Windows NT are Windows NT 3.1, NT 3.5, 3.51, NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7. Windows NT 3.1 was the first release of the Windows NT line. The version number 3.1 was from the fact that it looked very much like Windows 3.1. It was released in 1993. Next was Windows NT 3.5 and then 3.51. 3.5 was released in 1994 and 3.51 in 1995, just a few months before Windows 95. The version after that was NT 4.0, released in 1996. It was advertised as 'power of Windows NT and look of Windows 95' and included Internet Explorer version 2. The next version was NT 5.0, which was re-branded as Windows 2000 before release, followed by Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and the most recently Windows 10.\nThe NT version number was not used for marketing purposes after Windows NT 4.0 but is still used internally and said to reflect the degree of changes to the core of the operating system. Windows 10 changes the internal version number to 10.0, which is the first time since 1996 that the internal version number has matched the marketing number.\nWindows NT can refer either an individual or following versions of Microsoft Windows:\nReferences.\nNotes"}

It is chronic, which means it does not go away. It is an autoimmune disease, where the person's immune system attacks their own body.\nThe immune system is partly made up of white blood cells in your body that fight off disease. In lupus, these white blood cells think that the healthy cells of the body around them are diseased, so they end up attacking healthy parts of the body. Lupus can be deadly. It causes swelling and tissue damage, and can attack any part of the body. It most commonly affects the heart, joints, skin, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys and the brain/nervous system. Some symptoms include: fatigue, fever with no cause, hair loss, mouth sores, sensitivity to sunlight, a skin disease, and Raynaud's syndrome. There is treatment for lupus, called immunosuppression, which is medicine that stops the white blood cells from damaging healthy cells for a while. After a while, this medicine wears off, and then the white blood cells go back to hurting healthy parts of the body again. For the disease of lupus, there is no cure that stops the white blood cells from attacking healthy parts of the body forever, but doctors are not giving up on finding a cure.\nLupus takes its name from the Latin word \"lupus\", meaning wolf. This is because a lupus-caused rash on a person's face makes the person's face look like the face of a wolf. In the United States alone, there may be 270,000 to 1.5 million (1,500,000) people with lupus. Worldwide, it is estimated (not known for sure, but a good guess) that over 5 million (5,000,000) people living with lupus. The disease mainly affects young women, but men can be affected as well."}
{"id": "34669", "revid": "557714", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34669", "title": "Hiragana", "text": "Hiragana is a part of the Japanese writing system. Japanese writing normally consists of kanji which are used for the main words in a sentence, usually content words, and hiragana which are used for the little words that make up the grammar (in English these would be words like \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201chis\u201d) called particles. Hiragana is also used for the endings of some of the words. \nHiragana is a syllabary, which means that each hiragana character stands for a syllable. It is therefore different from a language such as English which uses an alphabet in which most of the letters stand for one bit of sound (phoneme). There is also another syllabary called katakana which is mostly used for foreign words and names. The two kana systems are quite easy to learn, but kanji takes years of practice. In contrast, the kana systems can be learnt in two weeks.\nIn the past hiragana was considered as women's writing, while men wrote in kanji. Since kanji suit well in Chinese but poorly in Japanese, it was the women who wrote the first Japanese books, poems and songs. Later the Buddhist clerics, such as Rennyo (d. 1498), wrote in hiragana to make the religious message easy to understand so that everyone could read it.\nSometimes the whole of a text may be written in hiragana to make it easy. This would be used in books for young children, or for students starting to learn Japanese, or when writing the lyrics for songs underneath the music where it is important to show how the words fit the music. Some rare or strange kanji may also have so-called \"furigana\" characters above it. They are hiragana which show how the kanji is to be pronounced.\nIn Hiragana each character (kana) is either a vowel (such as \"a\": \u3042); a consonant followed by a vowel (such as \"ka\": \u304b); or, at the end of a syllable, an \"n\": (\u3093), although sometimes this sounds more like an \u201cm\u201d or \u201cng\u201d.\nAs an example of how the grammatical endings are used we can take the verb \u201cto eat\u201d which is\u98df\u3079\u308b (taberu). Here the main part of the word \u201ceat\u201d (pronounced \u201cta\u201d in this case) is the kanji \u98df. The other two syllables: \u201cbe-ru\u201d are in hiragana (\u3079\u308b). To say \u201cI ate\u201d or \u201cyou ate\u201d etc. you would say \u201ctabemashita\u201d, written\u98df\u3079\u307e\u3057\u305f (\u201cbe-ma-shi-ta\u201d is written in hiragana).\nTable of hiragana.\nThe main hiragana characters are shown in this table. \nNotice that the sound \u201chu\u201d is unknown in Japanese, so \u3075 is pronounced \u201cfu\u201d with an \u201cf\u201d which is blown lightly, like someone blowing out a candle.\nTo write the voiced sounds for \u201cg\u201d, \u201cd\u201d, \u201cz\u201d and \u201cb\u201d two little lines called a dakuten (\u309b) are added after a character starting with the unvoiced sounds \u201ck\u201d, \u201ct\u201d, \u201cs\u201d and \u201ch\u201d. A circle, (\u309c), is added after a \u201ch\u201d for the sound \u201cp\u201d. For example: \u306f gives the sound \u201cha\u201d; \u3070 gives the sound \u201cba\u201d; \u3071 gives the sound \u201cpa\u201d.\nSometimes when words are joined together to make compound words, the first sound of the second part changes from unvoiced to voiced. For example: \u201chana\u201d: \u306f\u306a (nose) + \u3061\u201cchi\u201d (blood) becomes \u306f\u306a\u3062 \u201chanaji\u201d (nosebleed)\nSome Japanese syllables which have sliding sounds add a small version of the hiragana for \"ya\", \"yu\" or \"yo\" (\u3083, \u3085 and \u3087) This is called \u201cy\u014don\u201d. For example: \u201csha\u201d sounds like \u201cshi\u201d+\u201dya\u201d so \u201cdensha\u201d (a tram) is written \u3067\u3093\u3057\u3083. A small \u201ctsu\u201d \u3063 called a \u201csokuon\u201d shows a doubled consonant: \u201cNippon\u201d (Japan) is written \u306b\u3063\u307d\u3093. Without the small \u201ctsu\u201d the first syllable would sound like the word \u201cknee\u201d. \nA student starting to learn to write Japanese can start with hiragana or with katakana. Hiragana is the basis of learning Japanese script. However, for someone who is about to visit Japan and just wants to be able to recognize a few words, katakana will be more useful as it will help to read many of the road signs, shop names and the names of things on restaurant menus."}

On October 10, 1911, Chiang Kai-Shek came back to China. \nIn 1918, he joined the Nationalist Party of Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen helped Jiang Kai-Shek make a military academic school called Huangpu Military School. In 1926 and 1927 he led the Northern Expedition to conquer local warlords and unify China. After Sun Yat-sen died, he pushed out the Communists in 1927. In 1928, he made a new government in Nanjing, and became head of the state. He focused on fighting the Communists and the Empire of Japan. In 1937, Japan began to invade China, and Chiang was in charge of the Nationalist Chinese Army, until the war ended in 1945. Chiang ruled China until 1949, when Mao Zedong, who led the Communist Party of China, attacked Chiang and his officials, and they were forced to flee to Taiwan."}

Fritz Zwicky in 1933 used dark matter to explain \"missing mass\" in the spinning speeds of galaxies in clusters. Later, many other observations have suggested that there is dark matter in the universe. The spinning speeds of galaxies, gravitational lensing of background objects, the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies: these are some of the examples that make scientists believe in dark matter.\nAccording to the Planck mission team, and based on the standard model of cosmology, the total mass\u2013energy of the known universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy . Thus, dark matter is estimated to make up 84.5% of the total matter in the universe, while dark energy plus dark matter make up 95.1% of the total \"stuff\" in the universe.\nBecause dark matter does not seem to give off or reflect light, x-rays, or any other radiation, the instruments that are used to find normal matter (like hot gas, stars, planets, and us) can't find dark matter. It seems that dark matter is not made of the same thing as the matter we see every day on Earth. The only way we can tell if dark matter is there, is by how it affects things we can \"see\" by gravity.\nIn 2006, a group of scientists claimed that they had found a way to find dark matter. Since dark matter is supposedly very different from normal matter, it is expected to act differently. The scientists observed two far-away galaxy clusters that had crashed into each other at high speed: normal matter would have been scattered nearby after the collision, while dark matter would not. By measuring gravity, they were able to detect what looked like two clouds of dark matter, with a cloud of normal matter (hot gas) in between them."}

{"id": "34699", "revid": "656019", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34699", "title": "Katakana", "text": "Katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca) is a Japanese script used for writing words borrowed from other languages. It is easier to read than the kanji (the picture method based on Chinese characters). Once the 46 katakana symbols have been learned, the reader knows how to pronounce them.\nKatakana and hiragana are both syllabaries. In English we use the letters of the alphabet. In most words each letter stands for a bit of sound (a phoneme). In a syllabary each symbol stands for a syllable. For example: in English we write \u201cWagamama\u201d: each of the eight letters standing for a sound: \u201cW-a-g-a-m-a-m-a\u201d. But if the word \u201cWagamama\u201d is divided into syllables there are four syllables (blocks of sound): Wa-ga-ma-ma. In Katakana it is written with four symbols: \u30ef\u30ac\u30de\u30de.\nHiragana works in the same way, but the symbols are mostly different. Katakana is perhaps a little easier to learn than Hiragana because the symbols are simpler and more \u201csquared off\u201d. Together Katakana and Hiragana are called \u201cKana\u201d.\nTable of katakana.\nThis is a table of the basic katakana strokes. The first chart shows the basic katakana (characters with red letters next to them are no longer used today).\nFrom the first table it can be seen that there are 46 basic characters (top left, first five columns, from \"a\" to \"wa\"). Diphthongs (vowels that slide from one sound to the other) have to be written with an extra symbol in small print. For example: the sound \u201cmu\u201d in our word \u201cmusic\u201d sounds like \u201cmyu\u201d so it is written \u30df\u30e5 (mi+yu). So the word \u201cmusical\u201d (as in a stage musical) is written: \u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb.\nA long vowel is shown in katakana by a kind of dash called a \u201cchoon\u201d (\u30fc).\nHow Katakana is used.\nKatakana is used to write words which have been borrowed from other languages, or to write foreign names and names of countries. For example, America is written \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab.\nIt is not always easy for us to recognize these words because the Japanese language does not have some of the sounds that we do in English. This means that Japanese have to find other ways to pronounce and write the word. For example: the word \u201ccoffee\u201d is written \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc (koo-hii). Sometimes the word is shortened as well: \u201ctelevision\u201d is written as \u30c6\u30ec\u30d3 (pronounced \u201cte-re-bi\u201d).\nSometimes it is impossible to show the difference between two foreign words, e.g. \u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc could spell either the name \u201cLara\u201d or \u201cLala\u201d (as in the Teletubbies). The Japanese have just one sound which is somewhere between our \u201cr\u201d and \u201cl\u201d.\nIn the Japanese language a consonant is always followed by a vowel. Words or syllables cannot end in a consonant (except n or m), so the Japanese put in an extra vowel. \u201cSki\u201d (as in skiing) becomes \u201csuki\u201d (\u30b9\u30ad), and a \u201cmusical\u201d, as we have seen, becomes \u201cmyuujikaru\u201d (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb).\nKatakana are also used for onomatopoeic words like \u201cding\u201d, or for making words look important, or for scientific names such as the names of birds. Sometimes sentences in books or cartoons may be written in katakana to show that someone is supposed to be speaking with a foreign accent. It is often used to write the names of Japanese companies, i.e. Suzuki is written \u30b9\u30ba\u30ad, and Toyota is written \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf.\nA small \u201ctsu\u201d \u30c3 called a \u201csokuon\u201d shows what we would write as a double consonant, e.g. the English word \u201cbed\u201d is used in Japanese for a western-style bed. It is pronounced \u201cbeddo\u201d and written \u30d9\u30c3\u30c9. The \u30c3 makes the \u201ce\u201d vowel short.\nLearning to read the katakana characters is useful for reading some of the signs in Japan, or items on the restaurant menus.\nJapanese sentences are usually written in a mixture of katakana, hiragana and kanji, e.g.:\n\u79c1\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059 (Watashi wa amerikajin desu: I am American). Here \u201camerika\u201d is written in katakana, \"Watashi\"(\u79c1) and the ending \u201cjin\u201d(\u4eba) are both written in kanji, and \u201cdesu\u201d (I am) is in hiragana."}

It has small pieces sticking out of a main frame; these are called \"teeth.\" A comb is usually flat.\nHumans have been using combs as a tool for a long time, at least for 5,000 years. Combs are used by humans to separate tangled hairs, to keep their hair clean and to style their hair. They are also used as a decoration for hair.\nCombs are used in the making of thread from fibers like wool or cotton. Combing makes all the fibres point the same way so a thread can be spun.\nHistory.\nThe first use of the comb was about 5,000 years ago. Different kinds of comb have been found throughout history by archaeologists. The ancient Egyptians carved out combs. In ancient China, combs were worn as hair decorations and accessories. Over time, combs have become into tools for taking care of hair. Today, there are hundreds of different kinds of combs.\nUse.\nCombs can be used to fix stray hairs and untangle wet hair. Another common use for the comb is to make hair be put in one position before tying it up. Combs may also be used to part hair for coloring, conditioning and braiding. Combs can also be worn as accessories that hold hair up in a special style."}

It is made of oils which give off scent to the surrounding air. The odoriferous compounds that make up a perfume can be manufactured synthetically or extracted from plant or animal sources.\nPerfumes were used in the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin. The artificial compounds gave a wider ranger of scents than natural materials.\nPerfume smells more when temperature is warmer. So people put it on the neck, wrist and back of the knee, because these parts are warmer. Eau de Cologne is a type of perfume which can be splashed on the body. It is not so concentrated as the usual perfumes.\nSources.\nPlants.\nToday, most common essential oils, such as lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus, are distilled. Raw plant material, the flowers, leaves, wood, bark, roots, seeds, or peel, is put into a distillation apparatus over water. As the water is heated, the steam passes through the plant material collecting the scents. The steam flow through a coil, where it is condensing back to liquid, which is then collected.\nMost citrus peel oils are cold pressed, like olive oil production. Citrus-fruit oils are cheaper than most other essential oils. Lemon or sweet orange oils got as by-products of the citrus industry are even cheaper.\nSynthetic sources.\nMany modern perfumes contain synthesized odorants. Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, Calone, a compound of synthetic origin, gives a fresh metallic marine scent that is widely used. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate to compounds that are not easily got from natural sources.\nHistory.\nThe word perfume used today derives from the Latin \"per fumum\", meaning \"through smoke.\" Perfumery, or the art of making perfumes, began in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt and was further refined by the Romans and Persians.\nThe world's first recorded chemist is considered to be a woman named Tapputi, a perfume maker who was mentioned in a cuneiform tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia. She distilled flowers, oil, and calamus with other aromatics then filtered and put them back in the still several times.\nIn 2005, archaeologists uncovered what are believed to be the world's oldest perfumes in Pyrgos, Cyprus. The perfumes date back more than 4,000 years. The perfumes were discovered in an ancient perfumery. At least 60 stills, mixing bowls, funnels and perfume bottles were found in the factory. In ancient times people used herbs and spices, like almond, coriander, myrtle, conifer resin, bergamot, as well as flowers.\nThe Arabian alchemist, Al-Kindi (Alkindus), wrote in the 9th century a book on perfumes which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils and medical substances.\nThe Persian chemist Avicenna introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of distillation, the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the rose. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes were mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which made a strong scent. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular. \nThe art of perfumery was known in western Europe since the 13th or 14th centuries. By the 18th century, aromatic plants were grown in France, Sicily, and Italy."}

It established a council of 25 barons to see John keep to the clauses, including access to swift justice, parliamentary assent for taxation, scutage limitations, and protection from illegal imprisonment.\nBecause he was forced to seal the charter, John sought approval to break it, from his spiritual overlord Pope Innocent III. Denouncing it as \"not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust\", the Pope agreed. The Magna Carta is still considered one of the most important documents ever written, having inspired the way we view issues of justice and liberty and influenced laws regarding such throughout the world.\nThe Magna Carta has influenced English law right down to the present day. It is one of the most celebrated documents in the History of England. It is recognized as a cornerstone of the idea of the liberty of citizens.\nContent.\nThe Magna Carta contains 63 clauses written in Latin on parchment. Only three of the original clauses in Magna Carta are still law today. One defends the freedom and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties customs of the City of London and other towns. This clause (translated) is the main reason the Carta is still famous:\nThis clause limits the power of rulers, and introduces the idea of lawful process and the idea of a jury. The BBC summarised the main points of the document as: \nThe BBC said the Magna Carta \"established a number of important principles, which have been copied around the world... It inspired the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\".\nHistory.\nThe origin is in the medieval feudal system, in which the King's word was law. It solved, at the time, a conflict between King John and his main men: the barons and bishops. Dispute grew between the barons and bishops and King John over taxes and disputes with the Pope. \nThe barons chose their time to put John under pressure. John had lost a battle against the French, been excommunicated by the Pope (1209\u20131213), and feared civil war at home. He met the barons at Runnymede, 20 miles south-west of London, in June 1215. The negotiation was managed by John's half-brother, William Longsp\u00e9e, and Elias of Dereham, steward to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton. \nThe content of the Carta was designed to re-balance power between the King and his subjects, but especially between John and the barons. When King John set his seal on Magna Carta he conceded the fundamental principle that even as king he was not above the law. That meant kings would not have as much power as they did before. The Carta also laid down rules of inheritance, and that convictions required some kind of official process. It stated that people had rights not to be unlawfully imprisoned. In other words, the king is bound to rule within the law. \nThirteen original copies of the Carta were made and distributed. Only four survive today. The four copies are in The British Library, The Bodleian Library, Lincoln Castle and Salisbury Cathedral. The Magna Carta was sent out again in 1220 by Henry III. In 2009 UNESCO recognized it in its \"Memory of the World\" register. The British Library brought all four copies together in February 2015, so that scholars could examine them side by side."}

There were always three beats in a bar (3/4 time).\nComposers liked the music of the minuet and often wrote them just as pieces of music for a keyboard or other instruments. Composers like Bach and Handel included them in their suites (collection of dance movements). Lully started to put them in his operas, often in pairs: Minuet I, Minuet II, then Minuet I repeated. Often the second minuet would be played by three instruments, so it was called a trio.\nIn the Classical music period the minuet and trio were used in symphonies and sonatas. They usually formed the third movement of a four movement work. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote minuets and trios. Gradually the minuets became faster so that they were called scherzos. By the 19th century the waltz had become fashionable among the new middle class. The polite minuet went out of fashion."}

It broke from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a Mormon movement, in the 19th or early 20th century. In 1890, the Latter-Day Saints stopped accepting polygamy.\nA few people who believed polygamy was an important part of their religion started the new church. They taught that a man needs more than one wife to be able to get to heaven.\nIt is believed the church had about 10,000 members in 2009. These live in the sister cities of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona; as well as Eldorado, Texas; Westcliffe, Colorado; Mancos, Colorado; Creston and Bountiful, British Columbia; and Pringle, South Dakota.\nIn the news.\nThe church has been in the news because its leader, Warren Steed Jeffs was arrested in southern Nevada in August 2006. Jeffs was arrested because he was accused of rape and molestation. At the time, Jeffs was on the FBI's Ten Most-Wanted list.\nThere has been another incident in 2008.\nBeginning April 4, 2008, over a four-day period, troopers and child welfare officials searched the church's ranch. They took 416 children into the temporary custody of the State of Texas. Originally officials from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services took 18 girls into temporary custody of the state. They acted because of a phone call from the ranch- it looks like a 16-year-old girl called the police to report she had been raped. She also said she had been married at age 15 to a 49-year-old man, Dale Evans Barlow. On the following day, Judge Barbara Walther of the 51st District Court issued an order authorizing officials to remove all children, including boys, 17 years old and under out of the compound. The children were being held by the Child Protective Services 45 miles away, north of the ranch. 133 women also voluntarily left the ranch with the children. The 16-year-old girl who alerted the authorities could not be located at the time of the raid. It looks like the call was made by a woman in her thirties, who gave a false identity. This woman is known by local police, as she has done similar things before. The woman was arrested for making the call (that triggered the raid) in April."}

A great influence was Carolus Linnaeus, who popularized the idea of binomial nomenclature using a two-part name indicating the genus, and the species. The human species is named \"Homo sapiens\". Names of species are often printed in italics, although there is no obligation to do so (this also goes for names of genera, etc., etc.)\nBiological classification is also known as taxonomy. It is a science, and like most sciences has evolved over time. At various times different principles were adopted, and it is not rare for different scientists to use different methods. Since the early 20th century, groupings are supposed to fit the Darwinian principle of common descent. These days, molecular evolution studies, which use DNA sequence analysis as data, are popular. This is often called \"phylogenetics\", a branch or form of cladism. This approach creates an evolutionary Tree of life (biology) and uses characters (traits) to decide on the branches of the taxonomy.\nSometimes organisms placed in the same group (taxon) are similar; such similarity is not necessarity coincidence. It may be the result of shared descent from a common ancestor.\nHomology.\nHomologous traits are similarities caused by common ancestry. They are distinct from traits that are analogous. For example, birds and bats both have the power of flight, but this is not used to classify them together, because it is not inherited from a common ancestor.\nIn spite of all the other differences between them, the fact that bats and whales both feed their young on milk is one of the features used to classify both as mammals, since it was inherited from a common ancestor.\nWhen the present system of naming living things was developed, Latin was the language most widely used around the world. So, such names are still in Latin. The official descriptions and diagnoses of new taxa in Latin were and are written in Latin as well. Zoologist allow any language for the description of animals. From January 1, 2012, new taxa of algae, fungi and plants may be described in either English or Latin.\nName endings.\nTaxa above the genus level are often given names based on a \"type genus\", with a standard suffix. The suffixes used in forming these names depend on the kingdom, and sometimes the phylum and class, as set out in the table below."}

Sometimes entries in the table, which are next to each other, do not match perfectly. For example, Haeckel placed the red algae (Haeckel's Florideae; modern Rhodophyta) and blue-green algae (Haeckel's Archephyta; modern Cyanobacteria) in his Plantae, but in modern classifications they are considered protists and bacteria respectively.

Food is broken down to smaller food particles which are soluble in water. Only then can the food be absorbed into the blood stream.\nDigestion occurs in three phases. Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can be got at by digestive enzymes. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use. Finally, the nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream. Once in the blood stream the nutrients are taken to the liver, which is a kind of chemical factory for the body.\nAfter we swallow food, it travels down a muscular tube to the stomach. There, it is mashed into a mixture like soup. The mixture passes into the small intestine, where tiny bits of food pass into the bloodstream. The food that is still left goes into the large intestine. Finally, waste products leave the body. Digestion usually takes about 18 hours. Food stays in the stomach for about three hours. If uncoiled, the small intestine would be about six meters (20 feet) long. Many digestive tracts are about as long as a bus.\nFood slowly enters the small intestine from the stomach. This is where nutrients are taken into the blood. It then enters the large intestine. Water is taken away from it. The food that is left is called feces. The feces are stored in the rectum until the waste can leave the body through the anus."}

Having sight means to be able to see. Seeing gives animals knowledge of the world. Some simple animals can only tell light from dark, but with vertebrates, the visual system is able to form images.\nThe ability to interpret visible light information reaching the eyes is called visual perception. Sight is the resulting perception. The components that are necessary for vision are known as the visual system.\nProcess.\nLight enters the animal's eyes, and a part of the eye called the lens sends information from the light to the back part of the eye called the retina. The retina is composed of light-sensitive cells which fire a signal down the optic nerve when light hits the cell. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres from all over the retina.\nWhen the information from the light leaves the retina, it goes to the brain. It travels along the optic chiasma until it reaches the optic cortex at the rear of the brain. The information is then processed to find out the shapes and colours of objects. From that and from memory, it can tell of what kind the object is. For example, it can somehow tell a tree from a house. The path on which this kind of information flows is called \"ventral stream\".\nThe brain can also tell where objects are. For example, it can tell how far away an object is (this is called depth perception). This is needed when catching a ball. The path on which this kind of information flows is called \"dorsal stream\".\nWhat is sense of sight.\nThe major problem in visual perception is that what people see is not simply a translation of an image on the retina. For one thing, we see the world right side up, even though the image on the retina is upside down (because it has passed through the lens). Therefore, it is difficult to explain what happens to create what we actually see. The key, which took centuries to be appreciated, is that the brain works on the data from the eyes, and marries it with memories and guesses, all at lightning speed. The result is an experience of the world which looks to each person as if it were simple reality. However, although based on reality, it is actually a mental construct, built by the brain.\nHistory.\nMany figures in the ancient world had ideas about vision. Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy and Galen all had their ideas, but most of these ideas were speculation. They were not based on any scientific method.\nAlhazen (965\u2013c. 1040) carried out investigations and experiments on visual perception. He extended the work of Ptolemy on binocular vision, and commented on the anatomical works of Galen.\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) is believed to be the first to recognize the special optical qualities of the eye. He wrote \"The function of the human eye ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. But I found it to be completely different\". His main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the line of sight, the optical line that ends at the fovea. Although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal and peripheral vision.\nHermann von Helmholtz examined the human eye and concluded that it was, optically, rather poor. The poor-quality information gathered by the eye seemed to him to make vision impossible. So he thought vision could only be the result of some form of unconscious inferences. As well as information from the eyes, the brain used information from previous experiences. The world as experienced is built up from assumptions and conclusions from incomplete data, using prior experience of the world.\nExamples of well-known assumptions, based on visual experience, are:\nThe study of visual illusions (cases when the inference process goes wrong) has yielded much insight into what sort of assumptions the visual system makes."}

She wrote many books for children. She had a son named Lars.\nBiography.\nAstrid Lindgren grew up in N\u00e4s, near Vimmerby, Sm\u00e5land, and many of her books are based on her family and childhood memories. However, Pippi Longstocking, her most famous character, was invented for her daughter Karin, who was, at the time, ill and had to stay in the bed.\nLindgren was the daughter of Samuel August Ericsson and Hanna Johnsson. She had two sisters. Her brother, Gunnar Ericsson, was a member of the Swedish parliament. She finished the school and took a job with the a local newspaper in Vimmerby. When she became pregnant with the chief editor's child in 1926, he proposed marriage. She did not accept, and moved to Stockholm, learning to become a typist and stenographer. There she gave birth to her son Lars in Copenhagen and left him with another family to care for him.\nAlthough poorly paid, she saved whatever she could and travelled as often as possible to Copenhagen to be with Lars; often just over a weekend, spending most of her time on the train back and forth. Eventually, she managed to bring Lars home, leaving him in the care of her parents until she could afford to raise him in Stockholm. In 1931 she married her boss, Sture Lindgren (1898-1952). Three years later, in 1934, Lindgren gave birth to her second child, Karin, who later became a translator. The family moved in 1941 to an apartment on Dalagatan, with a view over Vasaparken, where Astrid lived until her death.\nAstrid Lindgren died in 2002, at the age of 94.\nPolitics.\nIn 1976, they had a scandal in Sweden when Lindgren's had to pay taxes 102% of her income. This is known as the \"Pomperipossa effect\" from a story, which she published in \"Expressen\" on 3 March 1976. \nAstrid Lindgren was well known both for her support for children's and animal rights, and for her opposition to corporal punishment. In 1994, she received the Right Livelihood Award (also known as the Alternative Nobel Prize), \"...For her commitment to justice, non-violence and understanding of minorities as well as her love and caring for nature.\"\nBooks.\nSome of her books include:\nReferences.\n1. ^ John-Henri, Holmberg (1997/1999), \"Scandinavia\", in Clute, John, and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York: St. Martin's Griffin, pp.\u00a0841 ."}

This city is on the coast of the Cantabrian Sea and is very popular with tourists. Cantabria belongs to the Green Spain, the name given to the strip of land between the Cantabrian Sea and the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain.\nCulture.\nMany different examples of prehistoric cave art have been found, suggesting the Cantabrian culture is at least 15,000 years old. Cave art is the best known feature of the Cantabrian life. The latest round of systematic cave explorations began in the early 1970s. Now new art can be discovered every year. Some of the cave art is engraved, and others are painted. Much of the cave art is of animals. There are often pictures of red deer found from this area of Spain. There are also other unusual symbols that can be found. This attracts much interest and many tourists to this culture. The Cantabrian life revolves mainly around art, tourism, and fishing.

It has a university.\nHistory.\nEmperor Frederick II founded this town. He told the people of 99 villages to move in the new town. Frederick's son, Conrad IV of Germany finished the town in 1254. When Conrad died, his brother Manfred destroyed the town in 1259. Charles I of Anjou, king of Sicily, built it again soon.\nIt became soon the second city of the Kingdom of Naples.\nThe city of L'Aquila had much power because the 99 original villages helped it. Each village owned a borough (a small part of the town) and the borough was a part of the mother-village. That is also why the number 99 is so important in the history of L'Aquila.\nThe people also built a very peculiar monument, the Fountain of the 99 Spouts (\"Fontana delle 99 Cannelle\").\nThe city was an important market for the countryside. The saffron (a very important spice) was grown in fields around town; shepherds had millions of sheep near L'Aquila.\nAfter a few years L'Aquila became an important point of communication between cities in and out of the kingdom.\nOn 29 August 1294, the hermit Pietro del Morrone became pope Celestine V. The ceremony was in the church of Santa Maria di Collemaggio.\nTo thank the town, Celestine V decided that every year on that day every Christian who went to L'Aquila would be pardoned for his sins (bad actions). This is called Perdonanza, and it still happens every year on August 28 and 29. The Perdonanza is similar to the Jubilee Year, but arrived earlier.\nThe Perdonanza made the town more rich.

It was the largest of its type, with a maximum length of 9 metres (30 feet). \nThe body was broad and low-slung and covered in armour. Carnivores, attacking from above, would find no weak points, and the animal could defend itself by using its clubbed tail.\n\"Ankylosaurus\" was a herbivore, or plant-eater. Because there was no grass in the dinosaur times, the Ankylosaurus probably ate ferns and low shrubs.\nArmour.\nThe most obvious feature of \"Ankylosaurus\" is its armour, consisting of massive knobs and plates of bone, known as osteoderms or bony scutes, embedded in the skin. Osteoderms are also found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The bone was probably overlain by a tough, horny layer of keratin. \nThese osteoderms ranged greatly in size, from wide, flat plates to small, round nodules. The plates were aligned in regular horizontal rows down the animal's neck, back, and hips, with the many smaller nodules protecting the areas between the large plates. Smaller plates may have been arranged on the limbs and tail. Compared to the slightly more ancient ankylosaurid \"Euoplocephalus\", the plates of \"Ankylosaurus\" were smooth in texture, without the high keels found on the armor of the contemporaneous nodosaurid \"Edmontonia\". A row of flat, triangular spikes may have protruded laterally along each side of the tail. Tough, rounded scales protected the top of the skull, while four large pyramidal horns projected outwards from its rear corners.\nUnderneath it was covered by normal skin, but to get at it the carnivore would have to turn over an animal weighing up to 6,000 kg (11,000 lb)."}

He was born in Adalsbruk. He was an expressionist who painted 1789 known paintings. He is well known for his treatment of emotion such as fear. His way of seeing things had a large influence on the expressionism of the 20th century. People saw this treatment as being intense.\nDuring his life, he had success as a painter: He became famous outside Norway, and his paintings got high prices. The National Gallery (Norway) used much money to buy paintings by Munch. He painted a large murals in the \"aula\" (main room) of Norway's (then) only university.\nEarly life and education.\nHe had four brothers and sisters. He had followed his mother and sister by being the best artists in their family. While Edvard was still young, his mother and one of his sisters died. But it was when he was thirteen that he really came to like art. The first paintings he did were simple objects like medicine bottles and other objects. Later on, he drew oil paintings.\nHe went to technical college in 1879 where he learnt how to draw paintings with perspective. However, in 1880, the following year he left the school to become a painter.\nHe went to the Royal School of Art and Design. This is where he learnt sculpturing and naturalistic painting. This is where he drew his first important portrait of himself and his father.\nHealth and death.\nMunch was ill very often. Many scientists think that he suffered from bipolar disorder (manic depression). He died at his house in Oslo.\nPaintings.\n\"The Scream\" (1893; originally called \"Despair\"). This is Munch's best-known painting, and is one of the best known images in the world. It is one of the pieces in a series titled \"The Frieze of Life\". In the series Munch explored the themes of life, love, fear, death and melancholy. As with many of his works, he made several versions of the painting. One version was stolen from the \"Munch-museum\" in Oslo, Norway, on 22 August 2004, but on 31 August 2006 Norwegian police found it together with another picture that was stolen at the same time, \"Madonna\".\n\"The Frieze of Life\" themes come back throughout Munch's work. These themes can be seen in paintings such as \"The Sick Child\" (1886, portrait of his deceased sister Sophie), (1893\u20131894), \"Ashes\" (1894), and \"The Bridge\". The last-named shows limp figures. Those figures have faces with no features, or they have no faces at all. Threatening shapes of heavy trees and houses are above the figures. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers or as lurid, life-devouring vampires. Munch analysts say this reflects his sexual anxieties.\nOther websites.\nMunch and bipolar disorder:"}

The capital is Aosta.\nThe valley goes up towards Mont Blanc. It is the route out of Italy to the North-West. It was used by Roman armies, and the proof is in the archaeological artefacts found in Aosta. The town has been both French and Italian over the past few centuries, and the street names in Aosta are in both languages.\nIt is the smallest region in Italy, with an area of , and a population of about 126,883. It is the only Italian region which has no provinces. The regional government has taken all the administrative functions of a province. The region is divided into 74 \"comuni\".\nLimits.\nIts frontier to the north is with Switzerland (Canton Valais), to the west with France (region Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes), to the south and east with the Italian region of Piedmont.\nGeography.\nThe Valle d'Aosta is a small valley, the valley of the Dora Baltea river, with some smaller side valleys. It is in the middle of the Alps, surrounded by four of the tallest mountains throughout Italy and Europe:\nIn the Valle d'Aosta, a region with many mountains and close to the borders with other countries, the mountain passes are very important. Even though now there some tunnels, the passes are important. They add a historical and geographical perspective which is important to tourism and tradition.\nThe main mountain passes between the Val d'Aosta and other valleys are:\nThe southern part of the territory is occupied by the Gran Paradiso National Park, created in 1922 to protect plants and animals in danger of extinction.\nThe valleys were made by glaciers moving at a time when the entire region was covered by them. Currently, glaciers occupy only the highest peaks.\nThe Dora Baltea () river flows along the whole Valle d'Aosta, from the northwest to the southeast; it is long and is a tributary of the Po river.\nMountain communities.\nThe 74 \"comuni\" - with the exception of Aosta - of the Valle d'Aosta are organized in mountain communities (, ). There are eight mountain communities:\n\"Comuni\" with higher populations.\nThe 10 \"comuni\" of the Valle d'Aosta with the higher populations (January 2017) are:\nPeople.\nA person from the Valle d'Aosta is called a \"Valdotian\" (, ).\nPopulation.\nThe total population of Valle d'Aosta in 1 January 2017 was 126,883, of which 61,976 were male and 64,907 were female.\nEvolution of the population in the Aosta Valley\nLanguages.\nItalian and French are the region's official languages and are used for the regional government's acts and laws, though Italian is much more widely spoken in everyday life. Of the population of the valley 96% speaks Italian as either a first or second language. Of the population 70% speaks French as either first or second language. School education is given equally in both Italian and French.\nThe regional language is a dialect of Franco-Proven\u00e7al called Vald\u00f4tain (locally, \"patois\"). It is spoken as native tongue and as second language by about 58% of the population, according to a poll taken by the Fondation \u00c9mile Chanoux in 2002.

Its capital is Lhasa. English speakers often call this region Tibet, but Tibet can also mean any place where the Tibetan culture is local to.\nReligion.\nTibet's main religion is Buddhism. Their traditions make it a place of interest to many people. The local monks are sometimes said to have special, superhuman abilities. The writings of Tibetan monks are sometimes shared with outsiders, and are known for their insight. The \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" contains rituals for the dead and dying, somewhat similar to the Catholic last rites. Some Tibetans practice a religion called Bon. People who study Bon disagree where Bon came from, how old it is, and if it can be called a kind of Buddhism. The religious leader of Tibet's Buddhists is called the Dalai Lama. He was forced to leave the country when the Chinese Army took over. The Dalai Lama presently lives in exile in India, but often visits other countries. Many monks and other religious people also were forced to leave the country, and many of them started Buddhist and Bon centers in cities around the world.\nHistory.\nTibet formed from communities living along the Yarlung Tsangpo, the longest river in Tibet. Namri Songtsen united these communities under one king around 600 CE, with the city of Lhasa becoming capital. His son Songtsen Gampo took control of land beyond Lhasa and the Yarlung Tsangpo and started the Tibetan Empire. Tibetan writers say that Buddhists came to Tibet for the first time while Songtsen Gampo was king. Trisong Detsen, king from 755 to 794 CE, gave a lot of support to Buddhism. He helped build a monastery at Samye, which became very important. During Trisong Detsen's time as king, the Tibetan Empire had control over large areas of land. Tibet's borders touched Central Asia and Afghanistan at the west, Bangladesh at the south, and China at the east. After the king Langdarma was killed in 842, the Tibetan Empire collapsed, and Tibet was no longer united under one king.\nIn the late 900s and 1000s, people started new Buddhist and Bon traditions. Three of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism were started during this time, as well as the first Bon monasteries. People who study Tibet's history call this time the Tibetan Renaissance. In 1042, the Indian Buddhist master Atisha came to Tibet. Atisha inspired a reform of Tibet's monasteries and wrote an important guidebook for people to gain enlightenment. These kinds of guidebooks are called lamrim, and all of the lamrim books in Tibet are based on Atisha's book. The largest school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Gelug school, was started by people inspired by Atisha, particularly the monk Tsongkhapa (1357-1419). Tsongkhapa's writings on philosophy became the new norm in Tibet.\nThe Mongol Empire sent armies to Tibet in 1240, and took control over the country over the next nine years. The Mongols left the running of the country to leaders from the Sakya school of Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism spread to Mongolia, and today most people in Mongolia are Buddhists as a result. In the mid-1300s, Tibet became independent again, but the Mongols still had some power and influence. In 1577, the Mongol leader Altan Khan gave the leader of the Gelug school the title Dalai Lama. The fifth Dalai Lama was able to gain control of all of Tibet, and the Dalai Lama became not just the leader of the Gelug school but the leader of Tibet as well. During the 1700s, the Qing Empire, based in China, sent armies to Tibet and took official control of Tibet, but the Qing emperors mostly let the Dalai Lama run the country. The Qing emperor Qianlong gave his support to Tibetan Buddhism, allowing new translations of Buddhist books to be made and building new temples. In the late 1800s, the British Empire and Russian Empire began to be interested in having control of Tibet, as it was in the middle of Russian colonies in Central Asia and British colonies in India. Britain sent armies to Tibet in 1903-4. They forced Tibet to agree not to be friendly with Russia. A revolution ended the Qing Empire in 1911, and Tibet became independent again, and was independent for the next thirty-six years.\nIn 1949, Mao Zedong became the leader of China. Mao and the Chinese leaders thought that China should regain control of Tibet, and in 1950, Chinese troops entered the east of Tibet. Mao Zedong was a communist, and thought that many things about the way Tibetans lived their lives should be different. The Chinese communists did not like how much power the Dalai Lama, the Gelug school, and Buddhist groups in general had over Tibetan society, and they wished to reform how land was owned in Tibet. The changes the Chinese Communist Party made in Tibet were enforced with violence, and Tibetans began to rebel against the Chinese government. The Chinese responded by sending many troops in 1959, forcing the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans to flee to other countries. The Dalai Lama started a government in exile in India. Between 1959 and 1961, most of Tibet's monasteries were destroyed, and the Chinese Communist Party gained control over Tibetans' lives. China created an administrative division from part of Tibet called the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965, although ethnic Tibetans have not had much say in the running of this region. The Chinese government has encouraged large numbers of Han Chinese people to settle in Tibet. Groups outside of China such as the Human Rights Watch argue that the Chinese government is oppressing Tibetans and causing them to lose their culture.\nPolitical divisions.\nTibet is divided into 2 municipalities (\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02) and five autonomous prefectures (\u81ea\u6cbb\u5dde).\nInfluence outside Tibet.\nTibetan culture also influences other regions nearby, such as Nepal, Bhutan, parts of eastern Kashmir and some regions in northern most Republic of India, most notably Sikkim, Uttaranchal and Tawang. China claims part of the Indian province of Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet.\nUnrest.\nThere has been some protests in Tibet since China took control in the 1950s. Most of them have been because of social or economic problems. Some of them have been because there are people who believe Tibet should not be a part of China. To show their resistance, many Tibetans set themselves on fire to put the Chinese government under pressure to become independent again. In 2011, 19 people killed themselves. A railway line, the Qingzang railway, has been built, linking China to Lhasa. Also, rising prices of food, and difficult access to higher education have angered many people. The railway line also raised fears about more migration. This situation has led to some violence against people from outside Tibet. Some of this violence occurs outside Tibet. When it comes to assigning government posts in Tibet, more other nationalities of Chinese seem to be assigned, rather than Tibetans. The Chinese Government claims that if Tibet became independent again, its economy would suffer."}

When the gun was fired the air was released. The only way for the air to go was by pushing the pellet out. \nA later invention was the spring piston, these can only fire one shot before the spring has to be reset. Newer guns use air or another gas in a small cartridge, these guns can fire many more shots before the cartridge needs to be changed or refilled.\nThe projectile for an air gun is usually a pellet. Some guns of this sort fire small round pellets call \"bb\"s. Some people think this means ball bearing, but it does not. The letters bb stood for a size of shot that was used to make shotgun cartridges, This was used in the first bb guns.\nThe most popular calibres (pellet sizes) for air weapons are mm (also called .177 to .22). In many countries there are strict rules that limit the sales of air guns so not everyone can have one. \nThey are not as powerful as other guns but they can still hurt or even kill people. \nMany people enjoy air rifle and pistol shooting either for fun or hunting. In the Olympics and target games, air pistols are used in some of the shooting events."}

Active bribery is offering payment and asking for favour, and passive bribery is asking for payment and offering favour. It is still called bribery if the trade is never done.\nIt is sometimes difficult to decide whether something is a bribe or just a reward. If a father pays his son for washing the car, that is just a reward or payment. However, if a parent pays a child for eating up its dinner, that might be thought of as a bribe because most people would think that is not right.\nBribery can be a crime in more serious cases, such as when a person offers money to hide their own wrongdoing. If a motorist is caught speeding by a policeman and offers the policeman money or a bottle of vodka to persuade him not to report him, that is bribery. If someone wants to take something into a country that is forbidden (or that they would have to pay tax on), they might offer the customs officer a bribe to persuade him to let them through. Some corrupt people will not do their jobs at all (like delivering some package) unless they get a bribe on top of their normal pay.\nThose examples are clearly illegal (against the law) and are rare in many countries, but bribery is quite common in business in many parts of the world.

Giving business people presents in the hope that they will want to do business with you may just seem like good manners at times, but in some cases, it may seem more like bribery.\nPeople who are found to be taking bribes can sometimes lose their jobs.

{"id": "35327", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35327", "title": "Psychiatry", "text": "Psychiatry is a part of medicine that studies, diagnoses and treats mental illnesses and abnormal behaviours and conditions that cause problems and make life difficult for people. The people who practice psychiatry and treat others who have psychiatric problems are called \"psychiatrists\".\nPrescribing psychiatric medication.\nPsychiatrists are medically qualified doctors. They can legally prescribe medications to their patients to help emotional and behavioral problems. This does not apply to psychologists, who are not qualified to prescribe medicines.\nPsychiatrists learn about how the body and the brain work. Psychiatrists must learn about all kinds of illnesses. Sometimes a disease in the body causes the brain to work poorly. Cancer in the pancreas causes depression. Blood sugar problems in diabetes mellitus can cause a bad temper. These are only two examples.\nAs doctors, psychiatrists learn about how medications can help the brain work better. They also learn how medications sometimes cause problems to the brain. Sometimes psychologists send their patients to a psychiatrist if the patient seems to have a problem that medicine might help. The patient should continue to see the psychologist.\nIn the 1950s, the first medicine to help patients with bipolar disorder (formally known as manic-depressive illness) was discovered. This was lithium, a type of metal in a powder form. A bit later, the first medicine for psychosis was discovered. Later, medicines to calm people (tranquilizers), to end depression (anti-depressants), to help feelings remain the same each day (mood stabilizers) were discovered.\nMedicine for mental illness does not cure. Some of the medicines try to get brain chemicals to be the amounts they are in normal people. Other medicines \"slow down how fast the brain works\" so people with rapid thoughts can be in control of what they think and how they behave. When the medicines are stopped, symptoms often come back.\nSigmund Freud.\nThe best known psychiatrist is Sigmund Freud, a medical doctor who was trained in neurology. He became certain that hidden thoughts in the brain (which he called the unconscious) could cause physical symptoms and strange behavior in some people. He believed that human behavior was not all caused by the brain, but by things that happened to people when they were babies and young children. His research of this theory \u2013 the idea he had \u2013 led him to create \"talking therapy\" \u2013 psychoanalysis \u2013 where he tried to figure out what could cause the mind to do things like this.\nHe thought that his figuring things out and telling the patients what had caused the behavior would cure the patient. Unfortunately, it usually made no lasting changes. This is why psychiatrists (and psychologists) have gradually figured out many other ways of helping their patients.\nNeuropsychiatry.\nSince the medications for mental illness were first discovered, there have been tools to understand why the mentally ill behave and think in ways that make it not easy for them to live. Doctors do this by studying the brain as directly as they can.\nThis field of medicine is called neuropsychiatry. The medical doctors who work in the field are called neuropsychiatrists. They hope someday to really permanently cure or fix mental illness by finding ways to change the brain forever. In the meantime, they try to find ways to help by finding better medications.\nThe science of psychology is studies the way people behave and change. Psychologists apply this what is found to make new ways of helping people change how they behave. Talking therapy and applied psychology were the first important ways of helping people with some problems of regular life. Some kinds of mental illness can be helped some this way, but some kinds cannot be helped. They need medicines instead, then sometimes a psychologist can help the patient a great deal.\nCriticism.\nControversy has often surrounded psychiatry, and the term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967. The anti-psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments may be more damaging than helpful to patients. Psychiatry's history involves what may now be seen as dangerous treatments (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy, lobotomy). Two charismatic psychiatrists who came to personify the movement against psychiatry were R.D. Laing and Thomas Szasz. Some ex-patient groups have become very anti-psychiatric, often referring to themselves as \"survivors\".\nBessel van der Kolk is also a noted psychiatrist, author, researcher and educator based in Boston, USA. He states that there is a much higher incidence of psychiatrists administering prescribed medications among patients who have government insurance. Since most mental illnesses are trauma-induced, medication has little to no effect. Psychiatrists are supposed to rule out trauma before diagnosing but its more rare than not. Therefore, its often easier to be screened by a psychologist or therapist first. Van Der Kolk often suggests EMDR, meditation, neurofeedback, yoga, mindfulness, sensory integration, and the arts for treatment of trauma or PTSD. Symptoms of trauma are often manifested by anxiety, hypervigilance, depression and behavioral problems that medication really doesn't help on a long-term basis."}

In December 2009 Frusciante claimed on his website that he had left the band over a year ago.\nEarly RHCP era (1988-92).\nJohn Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988 after the previous guitarist, Hillel Slovak, died of a drug overdose. The band went on to record and release their fourth album, \"Mother's Milk\" in 1989. Following an international tour, Frusciante co-recorded the band's fifth album, \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\". In 1992, he left the band because he was overwhelmed by the international success of \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\". Frusciante abruptly announced his departure from the band just a few moments before a performance in Tokyo. He ended up playing the show and left quickly for a plane back to the USA.\n1992 to 1997.\nFrom 1992 to 1997, he recorded a couple of solo albums, which received various criticism due to Frusciante's use of lo-fi and strange synthesizer effects. Frusciante released \"Niandra LaDes &amp; Usually Just A T-Shirt\" in 1994 as a cure for there being \"no good music around any more\". From the time of being out of the band, Frusciante had started to experiment with drugs such as cocaine and heroin. In 1997, he released \"Smile From The Streets You Hold\" because he needed money for drugs at the time. He later took the album off the shelves as he did not feel comfortable with it being sold.\nReturn and Red Hot success.\nBand mate and long-time friend Flea asked John if he would like to rejoin the band in 1998. Frusciante was so overjoyed by the question that the band regrouped and started the recording process. In 1999, the band released \"Californication\". During the Californication tour, Frusciante recorded some more songs in what would eventually become \"To Record Only Water For Ten Days\", which was released in 2001. Frusciante returned to the recording studio in early 2002 in which they would later release the band's eighth album, \"By the Way\".

In December of 2009 he announced that he would leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers and focus more on his solo albums.\nSolo records and side projects.\nAfter yet another world tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante decided to release some more of his own material between 2004-2005.

Unfinished parts of his mechanisms are on display in the London Science Museum. \nCharles Babbage was born in England, at 44 Crosby Row, Walworth Road, London.

In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth.\nHis Brain is also on display in the Science Museum in London.\nWorks.\nBabbage worked and wrote on many ideas of science, engineering and mathematics, but he is most famous for two machines he started and never finished. His Difference Engine would have been a much better calculator than any made before then. His Analytical Engine would have been the first real computer.\nKnowing that there were many errors in the calculation of mathematical tables, Babbage wanted to find a way to calculate them mechanically, removing errors made by humans. Three different factors seem to have influenced him: a dislike of untidiness; his experience working on logarithmic tables and differential calculus; and work on calculating machines already done by Wilhelm Schickard, Blaise Pascal, and Gottfried Leibniz. He first talked about the principles of a calculating engine in a letter to Sir Humphrey Davy in 1822.\nBabbage's engines were among the first mechanical computers. His engines were not actually completed because he did not have enough money. Babbage realized that a machine could do the work better and more reliably than a human being. Babbage controlled building of some steam-powered machines that more or less did their job; calculations could be mechanized to an extent. Although Babbage's machines were large machines they were organized in a way similar to modern computer architecture. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction based, control unit could make conditional jumps and the machine had a separate I/O unit. Ada Lovelace studied how to program them."}

Pavia is in the Lombardy Region with 71.486 people living in it. It is a very old, historical city. It is 30 km south of Milan.\nHistory of Pavia.\nThe town of Pavia (then known as Ticinum) was a big city and a special military area for the Romans.\nHere, in 476, Odoacer won against Flavius Orestes after a long war. To make the city pay for helping his enemy, Odoacer completely ruined Pavia, but Orestes was able to escape to a city called Piacenza, where Odoacer followed and killed him, and removed from the throne his son Romulus Augustus. This is often thought of as the end of the Western Roman Empire.\nA late name of the city in Latin was Papia (probably related to the Pope), which developed to the Italian name Pavia. Sometimes it's called Ticinum Papia, using both Latin names.\nAfter the Lombards conquest, Pavia became the capital of their kingdom. During the Rule of the Dukes, it was ruled by Zaban. It continued to act as the administrative centre of the kingdom, but by the reign of Desiderius, it had fallen to a first-rate defensive work and Charlemagne took it in the Siege of Pavia (June, 774) assuming the kingship of the Lombards. Pavia remained the capital of the Italian Kingdom and the centre of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the twelfth century.\nIn the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing commune. In the political division between Guelphs and Ghibellines that characterizes the Italian Middle Ages, Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline, a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with Milan as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the Lombard League against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who was attempting to reassert long-dormant Imperial influence over Italy.\nIn the time after that, Pavia was an important and busy town. Under the Treaty of Pavia, Emperor Louis IV gave the Palatinate to his brother during his stay in Italy. Pavia held out against the domination of Milan, finally yielding to the Visconti family, rulers of that city in 1359; under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre, being the seat from 1361 of the University of Pavia founded around the nucleus of the old school of law, which attracted students from many countries.\nThe Battle of Pavia (1525) marks a watershed in the city's fortunes, since by that time, the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party (allied with the Pope) and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V. Thus during the Valois-Habsburg Italian Wars, Pavia was naturally on the Imperial (and Spanish) side. The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713. Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796, when it was occupied by the French army under Napoleon.\nIn 1815, it again passed under Austrian administration until the Second War of Italian Independence (1859) and the unification of Italy one year later."}

The city is about 100 miles (160 kilometres) north of Rome. It covers a high hilltop and part of the valleys around the area.\nThe history of Perugia goes back to the Roman Empire. However, major parts of the city have been destroyed, and rebuilt, because of many wars, and of earthquakes in the mid-19th century. In recent decades, the city has been known as a university town, with the University of Perugia (about 34,000 students), the University for Foreigners (5,000 students), and some smaller colleges, also. There are annual festivals and events: the Eurochocolate Festival (October), the Umbria Jazz Festival, and the International Journalism Festival (in April).\nPerugia is a well-known artistic center of Italy. The famous painter Pietro Vannucci, nicknamed Perugino, came from Citt\u00e0 della Pieve near Perugia. He decorated the local \"Sala del Cambio\" with a beautiful series of frescoes; eight of his pictures can also be seen in the National Gallery of Umbria. Perugino was the teacher of Raphael, the great Renaissance artist who produced five paintings in Perugia (today no longer in the city) and one fresco. Another famous painter, Pinturicchio, lived in Perugia. Galeazzo Alessi is the most famous architect from Perugia. The city symbol is the griffin, which can be seen in the form of plaques and statues on buildings around the city.\nHistory.\nPerugia was an Umbrian settlement but first appears in written history as \"Perusia\", one of the twelve confederate cities of Etruria. It was first mentioned in Q. Fabius Pictor's account, used by Livy, of the expedition carried out against the Etruscans by Fabius Maximus Rullianus in 310 or 309\u00a0BC. At that time, a thirty-year \"indutiae\" (truce) was agreed upon; however, in 295\u00a0BC, Perusia took part in the Third Samnite War and was reduced, with Volsinii and Arretium (Arezzo), to seek for peace in the following year.\nIn 216 and 205 BC, Perugia assisted Rome in the Second Punic War. Little else is known until 41-40 BC, when Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony) took refuge there, in the Roman civil war between Mark Antony and Octavian. Much of ancient Perugia was destroyed by Octavian (later became Emperor Augustus) after a long siege, and its senators were sent to their death. A number of lead bullets used by slingers have been found in and around the city. The city was burnt, we are told, with the exception of the temples of Vulcan and Juno. The huge Etruscan terrace-walls, naturally, can hardly have suffered at all. Afterward, the town, with the territory for a mile round, was allowed to be occupied by whoever came. It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases of statues exist, inscribed with the words \"Augusto sacr(um) Perusia restituta\". However, the town did not become a \"colonia\", until 251-253 AD, when it was resettled as \"Colonia Vibia Augusta Perusia\", under the emperor C. Vibius Trebonianus Gallus.\nPerugia is hardly mentioned, except by the geographers, until it was the only city in Umbria to resist Totila, who captured it and laid the city waste in 547, after a long siege, apparently after the city's Byzantine garrison evacuated. Negotiations with the besieging forces fell to the city's bishop, Herculanus, as representative of the townspeople. Totila is said to have ordered the bishop to be flayed and beheaded. St. Herculanus (Sant'Ercolano) later became the city's patron saint.\nIn the Lombard period, Perugia is spoken of as one of the principal cities of Tuscia. In the 9th century, with the consent of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, it passed under the popes; but by the 11th century its commune was asserting itself, and for many centuries the city continued to maintain an independent life, warring against many of the neighbouring lands and cities: Foligno, Assisi, Spoleto, Todi, Siena, Arezzo, etc. In 1186, Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, \"rex romanorum\" and future emperor, granted diplomatic recognition to the consular government of the city; afterward Pope Innocent III, whose major aim was to give state dignity to the dominions having been constituting the patrimony of St. Peter, acknowledged the validity of the imperial statement and recognized the established civic practices having the force of law.\nOn various occasions, the popes found asylum, from the conflicts in Rome, within its walls, and it was the meeting-place of five conclaves (Perugia Papacy), including those which elected Honorius III (1216), Clement IV (1285), Celestine V (1294), and Clement V (1305); the papal presence was characterized by a peace-time rule between the internal rivalries. But Perugia had no mind simply to serve the papal interests and never accepted papal sovereignty: the city used to exercise a jurisdiction over the members of the clergy. Also, in 1282, Perugia was excommunicated due to a new military conflict against the Ghibellines regardless of a papal prohibition. In the other hand, side by side with the 13th-century bronze griffin of Perugia, above the door of the \"Palazzo dei Priori\" stands, as a Guelphic emblem, the lion: Perugia remained loyal for the most part to the Guelph party in the struggles of Guelphs and Ghibellines. However this dominant tendency was rather an anti-Germanic and Italian political strategy. The Angevin presence in Italy appeared offer a counterpoise to papal powers: in 1319 Perugia declared the Angevin Saint Louis of Toulouse \"Protector of the city's sovereignty and of the Palazzo of its Priors\" and set his figure among the other patron saints above the rich doorway of the Palazzo dei Priori. At the half of the 14th century, Bartholus of Sassoferrato, who was a renowned jurist, asserted that Perugia was dependent upon neither imperial nor papal support. In 1347, at the time of Rienzi's unfortunate enterprise in reviving the Roman Republic, Perugia sent ten ambassadors to pay him honour; and, when papal messengers sought to force it by foreign soldiers, or to exact contributions, they met with vigorous resistance, which broke into open warfare with Pope Urban V in 1369; in 1370 the noble party reached an agreement signing the treaty of Bologna and Perugia was forced to accept a papal legate; however the vicar-general of the Papal States, G\u00e9rard du Puy, Abbot of Marmoutier and nephew of Pope Gregory IX, was expelled by a popular uprising in 1375, and his fortification of Porta Sole was razed to the ground.\nCivic peace was constantly disturbed in the 14th century by struggles between the party representing the people (\"Raspanti\") and the nobles (\"Beccherini\"). After the assassination in 1398 of Biordo Michelotti, who had made himself lord of Perugia, the city became a pawn in the Italian Wars, passing to Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1400), to Pope Boniface IX (1403), and to Ladislas of Naples (1408\u201314) before it settled into a period of sound governance under the \"Signoria\" of the condottiero Braccio da Montone (1416\u201324), who reached a concordance with the Papacy. Following mutual atrocities of the Oddi and the Baglioni families, power was at last concentrated in the Baglioni, who, though they had no legal position, defied all other authority, though their bloody internal squabbles culminated in a massacre, 14 July 1500. Gian Paolo Baglioni was lured to Rome in 1520 and beheaded by Leo X; and in 1540 Rodolfo, who had slain a papal legate, was defeated by Pier Luigi Farnese, and the city, captured and plundered by his soldiery, was deprived of its privileges. A citadel known as the \"Rocca Paolina\", after the name of Pope Paul III (Italian: Paolo), was built, to the designs of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger \"\"ad coercendam Perusinorum audaciam\".\"\nIn 1797, the city was conquered by French troops. On 4 February 1798, the \"Tiberina Republic\" was formed, with Perugia as the capital, and the French tricolour as flag. In 1799, the Tiberina Republic merged to the Roman Republic.\nIn 1832, 1838 and 1854, Perugia was hit by earthquakes. Following the collapse of the Roman republic of 1848-49, when the Rocca was in part demolished, it was seized in May 1849 by the Austrians. In June 1859, the people rebelled against the temporal authority of the Pope and established a provisional government, but the insurrection was quashed bloodily by Pius IX's troops. In September 1860 the city was united finally, along with the rest of Umbria, as part of the Kingdom of Italy.\nEconomy.\nPerugia has become famous for chocolate, mostly because of a single firm, Perugina, whose Baci (kisses) are widely exported. Perugian chocolate is very popular in Italy, and the city hosts a chocolate festival every October.\nGeography.\nPerugia is the capital city of the region of Umbria.\nCities' distances from Perugia: Assisi , Siena , Florence 145\u00a0km, Rome .\nClimate.\nEven though Perugia is in the Central part of Italy, the city has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfa\"), similar to much of Northern Italy.\nDemographics.\nIn 2007, there were 163,287 people living in Perugia, in the Province of Perugia, Umbria, of whom 47.7% were male and 52.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 16.4 percent of the people, compared to pensioners, who number 21.5%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.1 percent (minors) and 19.9% (pensioners). The average age of Perugia residents is 44, compared to the Italian nationwide average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the number of people grew by 7.86%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent.\nAs of 2006, 90.84% of the people were Italian. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (particularly from Albania and Romania): 3.93%, the Americas: 2.01%, and North Africa: 1.3%. Most people are Roman Catholic.\nEducation.\nPerugia today hosts two main universities, the ancient University of Perugia (Italian: \"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi\") and the University for Foreigners Perugia (\"Universit\u00e0 per Stranieri\"). \"Stranieri\" serves as an Italian language and culture school for students from all over the world. Other educational institutions are the Perugia Fine Arts Academy \"Pietro Vannucci\" (founded in 1573), the Perugia Music Conservatory for the study of classical music, and the RAI Public Broadcasting School of Radio-Television Journalism. The city is also host to the Umbra Institute, an accredited university program for American students studying abroad. The \"Universit\u00e0 dei Sapori\" (University of Tastes), a National centre for Vocational Education and Training in Food, is in the city as well.\nFrazioni.\nThe \"comune\" includes the \"frazioni\" of Bagnaia, Bosco, Capanne, Casa del Diavolo, Castel del Piano, Cenerente, Civitella Benazzone, Civitella d'Arna, Collestrada, Colle Umberto I, Cordigliano, Colombella, Farneto, Ferro di Cavallo, Fontignano, Fratticiola Selvatica, La Bruna, La Cinella, Lacugnano, Lidarno, Migiana di Monte Tezio, Monte Bagnolo, Monte Corneo, Montelaguardia, Monte Petriolo, Mugnano, Olmo, Parlesca, Pianello, Piccione, Pila, Pilonico Materno, Ponte della Pietra, Poggio delle Corti, Ponte Felcino, Ponte Pattoli, Ponte Rio, Ponte San Giovanni, Ponte Valleceppi, Prepo, Pretola, Ramazzano-Le Pulci, Rancolfo, Ripa, Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, Sant'Egidio, Sant'Enea, San Fortunato della Collina, San Giovanni del Pantano, Sant'Andrea d'Agliano, Santa Lucia, San Marco, Santa Maria Rossa, San Martino dei Colli, San Martino in Campo, San Martino in Colle, San Sisto, Solfagnano, Villa Pitignano.\nCollestrada, in the \"territorio\" of the suburb of Ponte San Giovanni, saw a battle between the people of Perugia and Assisi in 1202.\nMain sights.\nArt.\nPerugia has had a rich tradition of art and artists. The High Renaissance painter Pietro Perugino created some of his masterpieces in the Perugia area. The other High Resaissance master Raphael was also active in Perugia and painted his famous Oddi Altar there in 1502-1504.\nToday, the \"Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria\" in Perugia houses a number of masterpieces, including the \"Madonna with Child and Six Angels\" (Duccio), which represents the Renaissance Roman Catholic Marian art of Duccio. Also, the private Art Collection of the \"Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia\" has two separate locations.\nThe Collegio del Cambio is an extremely well preserved representation of a Renaissance building and houses a magnificent Pietro Perugino fresco.\nTransport.\nPerugia has taken drastic measures against car traffic. At certain hours of the day, driving is forbidden in the city centre. Large parking lots are provided in the lower town, from where escalators lead up through the \"Rocca Paolina\" into the city. Since 2008, a MiniMetro has also been in operation, with seven stations.\nPerugia railway station, also known as Perugia Fontivegge, was opened in 1866. It forms part of the Foligno\u2013Terontola railway, which also links Florence with the \"Roma Termini\" railway station in Rome. The station is at Piazza Vittorio Veneto, in the heavily populated district of Fontivegge, about southwest of the city centre.\nSan Egidio Airport is outside the city.\nTwin towns\u2014Sister cities.\nPerugia has twin and sister city agreements with the following cities:"}

Biological weapons are also called bio-weapons. Their use in war is called biological warfare.\nParts of a biological weapon.\nA biological weapon usually has two parts. The first is the biological agent (also called a bio-agent, biological threat agent, or biological warfare agent). This is the pathogen that is meant to make people sick. The second is the delivery system - how the biological agent is going to get to and expose the people it is supposed to infect.\nSome bio-agents can be \"weaponized\" - changed to make them more dangerous. For example, sometimes scientists can change a pathogen's genes so the pathogen is deadlier, and so it will not be killed by usual antidotes or treatments. Some bio-agents can be changed so they are easier to store, spread, or use as weapons.\nAs of 2016, there are more than 1,200 different kinds of bio-agents that could be made into weapons.\nExamples of biological agents.\nExamples of some biological agents and toxins are listed below.

She was born in Monroeville, Alabama. She was most famous for writing \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". That book was published in 1959. Civil rights issues in Alabama influenced her writing. Harper Lee's interests apart from writing were watching politicians and cats, travelling and being alone.\nThroughout her life, Lee had said that she would never publish another novel. However, in 2015, Lee announced \"Go Set a Watchman\", a sequel to \"To Kill A Mockingbird\".\nLee died on February 19, 2016, in a retirement facility in Monroeville, Alabama from complications of a stroke at the age of 89.\nChildhood.\nIn 1926, Harper Lee was born in the Monroeville, Alabama. She was the youngest child out of three children. Her father was a law expert and part of the Alabama State lawmaking body. Her mother had trouble with mental illness.

She used to take part in many activities at school, and was part of Glee Club and literary honorary \"society\". She went to the all-female Huntingdon College in Montgomery following her sister who became a law expert. Later, Lee changed the school to the University of Alabama and started to learn about the law. But she wasn\u2019t really interested in the things that she was learning. Though she was really interested in her studies and her writings. Lee wrote amusing, and funny school magazines that came out regularly, Rammer Jammer and became its editor. \"For one year,\" she went to Oxford University as a student who studies outside his or her home country. But still, Lee didn\u2019t like the law. Her father was giving money for her education, but Lee thought that she needed to be self-supporting.

Lee wrote many to write few longer stories, Lee moved to New York to chase after a career as a writer. Hohoff, the editor of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" convinced Lee to write a new novel from the point of view of Scout as a child. Two years later, it became \"To Kill a Mockingbird\".

The word \"ubuntu\" is an African word meaning \"humanity to others\". It is pronounced \"oo-boon-too\".\nIt is one of the most popular Linux distributions and it is based on Debian Linux computer operating system. The goal with Ubuntu is to make it easy to use and install onto a computer. Ubuntu can be used on all types of personal computers (and even devices such as robots) including in Windows 10. Ubuntu is downloaded as a DVD, which is free to download on the Ubuntu website. It can be installed or tested by running the DVD.\nA new release of Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years. The latest release is 20.10 (\"Groovy Gorilla\"), while the most recent long-term support release (what most users may want to choose) is 20.04 LTS (\"Focal Fossa\"), which is supported until 2028.\nStarted in 2004, Ubuntu has been developed by Canonical Ltd., a company owned by a rich South African man named Mark Shuttleworth.\nPackages and software support.\nUbuntu splits all software into four different categories to show differences in licensing and the amount of support available. They are:\nFree software here includes only software that meets the Ubuntu licensing requirements, which almost are the same as the Debian Free Software Guidelines. There is one difference for the Main category, however it has firmware and fonts which cannot be changed, but are included if Ubuntu will not work right.\nNon-free software is usually unsupported (Multiverse), but some exceptions (Restricted) are given for very important non-free software. Supported non-free software include device drivers that are needed to run Ubuntu on current hardware. The level of support in the Restricted category is less than that of Main, since the developers may not be able to get to the source code. It is wanted that Main and Restricted should contain all the software needed for a general-use Linux system.\nBesides the official repositories is \"Ubuntu Backports\", which is an officially known project to backport newer software from later releases of Ubuntu. The repository is not comprehensive (meaning that it has parts missing from it); it is mostly made up of user-requested packages, which are accepted if they meet quality guidelines.\nReleases.\nTwo new releases of Ubuntu are released each year, normally in April and October.\nThe number of the Ubuntu release is 'X.YY', with 'X' being the year of release (minus 2000) and 'Y' being the month of release. For example, Ubuntu 4.10 was released in October (the tenth month of the year), 2004. The name of the release (for example, Breezy Badger) is an adjective (a describing word) followed by the name of an animal.\n\"LTS indicates Long Term Support.\"\nVery old (i.e. 32-bit i386) processors have been supported up to Ubuntu 18.04, but users \"will not be allowed to upgrade to Ubuntu 18.10 as dropping support for that architecture is being evaluated\".\nPackage.\nUbuntu's official software package repository includes, for example, UNetbootin.\nVariants.\nUbuntu is available in many different variants, e.g. because there are several options for which desktop environment to use.\nThe official sister distributions which are fully supported by Canonical are:"}

Of the lakes in the United States, only Oregon's Crater Lake is deeper at 1930 feet (588 m).\nSome visitors experience altitude sickness, because there is less oxygen in the air at higher altitudes. To fight this, experts recommend avoiding heavy exercise or drinking alcohol until the body adjusts to the lower oxygen level."}

He creates a serum of a special drug. It is supposed to separate the two different sides. He tests it on himself. The experiment succeeds all too well. Dr Jekyll changes into his evil self, Edward Hyde. Hyde commits horrible crimes in London, and changes back into Dr Jekyll. Eventually, Jekyll turns into Hyde without wishing to, with terrible consequences.\nThemes.\nThe novel is based on the Victorian English idea of pretending to be someone else, and acting a different way around other people to look more respectable. This is shown by Jekyll changing into Hyde. It is also a variation on the theme of \"scientist meddling with nature comes to grief\"."}

In other words, if something is sexually exciting, then it is said to be \"erotic\". Eroticism is an \"erotic\" feeling. It is named after Eros, the Ancient Greek god of love.\nMany types of things can be part of \"eroticism\". Things that make a person feel erotic (sexually aroused or excited) include the sight, touch, smell, and sound of another person. A person may feel erotic when they see or touch or smell, or hear someone that they love in a sexual way. \nSometimes \"eroticism\" has nothing to do with another person. A person might feel erotic from watching a movie, looking at pictures in a magazine, listening to a piece of music, reading a story or article, or just thinking their own thoughts, or being aware of their own body. In fact, everything can be eroticism for someone.\nWhat makes eroticism?\nSome things are designed and made especially to make people feel erotic. Things that are designed to make people feel erotic are called \"erotica\". This word is most often used for art, books and magazines.\nEroticism and pornography.\nMost people believe there is a difference between \"erotica\" and \"pornography\", but some people have argued that all \"erotica\" is \"pornographic\". (In other words, some people believe that all pictures, movies or writing which are sexually exciting are rude and wrong, and should not be made.)\nPeople who have studied this subject say that erotica is not harmful to anyone, and may be helpful with people's loving relationships. The same writers say that pornography, which generally shows a person being treated without respect or love, is not helpful with people's loving relationships."}

The name comes from the town of Taranto in Italy. People used to believe that if someone was bitten by a tarantula spider they needed to do this dance in order to drive out the poison. The dancer would get more and more excited until he (or she) seemed mad.\nSome people think that maybe these people never really believed this, but that it was an excuse to dance at a time when the church said that dancing was not allowed. The spider is, in fact, only a little bit poisonous.\nSome composers enjoyed writing fast pieces in 6/8 time which they called \"Tarantella\". Mendelssohn wrote one as the last movement of his Symphony no 4 (the Italian). Chopin and Liszt also wrote Tarantellas."}
