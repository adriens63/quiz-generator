It was developed by Spike Chunsoft Co Ltd (previously Spike Co Ltd) as a beta named DISTRUST. DISTRUST \nwas cancelled due to the story being too dark and the setting was not usable for high school students. Two animated shows were released: Danganronpa: The Animation and Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School.\nStory.\n/Danganronpa: The Animation.\nMakoto Naegi and 15 other smart students (in a certain area) enter a beautiful high school named Hope's Peak Academy. In the game, Makoto Naegi enters the school building before fainting and waking up in a classroom. While in the animation, Makoto steps foot onto the school and immediately falls unconscious. He then goes to the gym to meet fifteen other high school students who joined Hope's Peak Academy. After the introductions, a robotic bear named Monokuma introduces himself and states that they are trapped in the school. The only way to escape is to commit murder without getting caught by the other students. For the rest of the game/animation, Makoto and his classmates are to find the murderer's of each case, if they do not find the murderer they will be executed, if they do find the murderer, only the murderer will be executed.\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair.\nHajime Hinata and 15 other students join an academy. When Hajime enters the academy he walks into a room that is filled with binary code and a door. When he walks through the door, he enters a classroom filled with fifteen other students. They all introduce themselves, a robotic rabbit named Usami/Monomi/Magical Girl Usami appears and introduces herself as their teacher. After her introduction, she gets a magical wand and twirls it around, the ceiling and walls rip off to show a paradise beach. Afterwards on a beach, she asks them to earn 15 Friendship Fragments. Afterwards, Usami asks everyone to come back to the beach, but a random storm shows up and a silhouette of Monokuma appears on a monitor. The silhouette asks the students to meet at a place on the island named Central Park. Monokuma introduces himself on the statue in Central Park and begins the killing game. He tells them the only way to escape the island successfully is to kill another student without getting caught by the other students. For the rest of the game, Hajime and his classmates attempt to debunk the mysteries and catch the murderers.\nDanganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls.\nKomaru Naegi and Toko Fukawa(from the first game) attempt to save the world from dangerous Monokuma's. The events of this game take place during the second and first game. Komaru Naegi has been trapped inside an apartment with no connection to the outside world for 1/2 years. Every day she goes to the door leading out but it seems to be locked from outside. However, on this one day food was delivered to her and she bang on the door to let her out and to help her but sharp claws almost strike her face. A huge Monokuma breaks open the door and begins to chase her around the apartment. After she gets out of the apartment, she must run to the elevator which to her surprise brings out Byakuya Togami. He gives her a hacking gun(that is designed as a megaphone but shoots bits of codes at anything and makes it malfunction and break.) and tells her to run to a nearby restaurant and find a member of Future Foundation. Monokuma's enter the restaurant and start attacking the customers. Afterwards, Komaru finds a Future Foundation member and they give her instructions to go to a helicopter. When she gets to the helicopter, she sees a kid wearing a Monokuma head singing. She gets onto the helicopter but a Monokuma tries to enter. After she solves the issue, another issue begins. A Monokuma was up front tinkering with the helicopter controls and drives them up into the sky.

A Monokuma appears in front of her then other start to surround her, she faints and wakes up in a room. The Ultimate Servant, Nagito Komaeda enters the room and asks if she could come to the main room. When she enters, five children introduce themselves as the Lil' Ultimate's. They also introduce a new type of killing game named Demon Hunting where the Lil Ultimate's had a target hitlist and it was their objective to kill all adults and make it a kids only place. Komaru's second failed execution begins, she falls down a hole with a parachute. That is where she meets Genocide/Genocider Jack/Jill/Sho/Toko. For the rest of the game, they go on misadventures to defeat the Lil' Ultimate's all together.\nDanganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak Academy.\nThis animation has three seasons.\nDespair Arc.\nTakes place before the events of Trigger Happy Havoc. A new teacher treats the Danganronpa 2 students. Chisa Yukizome is substitute teacher before she becomes an actual teacher at Hope's Peak Academy. In the first episode, most of the class is missing so the class that is present in the classroom and Chisa go on a heist to find all the students. As the show progresses the more the episode's get darker. On the final few episodes, Junko Enoshima brainwashes Chisa Yukizome, gives Chiaki Nanami false hope and death, and brainwashes all the students into committing despair-like actions.\nFuture Arc.\nTakes place after the events of Goodbye Despair. Older Makoto Naegi, Aoi Asahina, Kyoko/Kyouko Kirigiri, and a few others are trapped inside the Future Foundation building. The objective of this killing game is similar to the normal Danganronpa style, however there is only one killer. Everyone is given a wristband with a forbidden action and a timer. If they wristband wearer commits the forbidden action a poison will be put inside of them and make them bleed out of their eyes. It will also turn a part of the skin black and kill them. One the timer ends a gas will be put everywhere in the building in put them to sleep. On the final episode, the show is put on a cliff hanger.\nHope Arc.\nTakes place after the events of Goodbye Despair. Makoto Naegi is tasked to stop Ryota Mitarai from sending a brainwashing video(using his brainwashing technique) to the entire world which is supposed to fill them with hope. This season is only one episode long. At the end of the episode, Makoto Naegi rebuilds Hope's Peak Academy and becomes the new principal. This marks the end of Hope's Peak Academy.\nDanganronpa V3: Killing Harmony.\nKaede Akamatsu and her classmates join a new academy, \"The Ultimate School for Gifted Juveniles\". Kaede introduces herself and walks out of a locker she was asleep in. She explores the classroom a bit. Shuichi Saihara falls out of a locker and begins to freak out. They both introduce themselves and tell each other how they arrived. They leave the classroom to be seen by exisals, that chase them to the gym. When they enter they see 14 other students. 5 smaller versions of Monokuma appear named the Monokubs. They introduce themselves and give everyone new clothes to put on. Afterwards, a flashlight is used to erase their memory of the event and the beginning happens all over again. They all go back to the gym to find Monokuma. Monokuma begins the killing game. Kaede and her classmates must find out the mysteries of the school and find the murderer to each case.\nGameplay.\nThe game has three elements that make it a chapter(besides prologue). Daily Life - Deadly Life - Class Trial.\nDaily Life.\nIn Daily Life, you will have Freetime Events that allow you to raise your friendship level in the game. You may also choose not to do freetime events by staying in your dormitory and taking a nap in your bed. Every day in the game, everyone meets in the cafeteria to discuss what they have found.\nDeadly Life.\nIn Deadly Life, a student has been killed and you must investigate and get clues to help you during the Class Trial. When three or more people discover a body an announcement will play along the lines of this, \"A body has been discovered! Please meet in the ???\". In Trigger Happy Havoc, the player would always find the body before the announcement played. This was not the case for Goodbye Despair and Killing Harmony.\nClass Trial.\nIn a Class Trial, you will have to participate in the many discussions. You will have a health bar and a speaking gauge. The health bar will lose hearts or lower itself when you fail a part of the trial. However, the musical part of the game will make you lose hearts depending on if you fail to press the correct button or miss a button. Other parts of the trial are, Non-Stop Debate and Hangman's Gambit. If you lose all your hearts or your health bar is fully gone then a vote will automatically begin and the player will be selected as the killer. You can go back to the Main Menu, try again, or restart. Once you finish the final part of the trial, which is putting the correct pictures onto a comic, then everyone will vote except for the player(besides Killing Harmony). They will vote for the actual killer and Monokuma will say his infamous, \"Let's give it all we got! It's punishment time!\". And Monokuma will grab a gable and hit it on a button which seems like it already knew who the killer was. And a pixelated Monokuma will choke the pixelated murderer and take them to their execution. Executions are based on what that person's interests are. After the execution, the chapter will end."}

Some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 90% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are \"endemic to Australia\". \nThe fauna is quite different from that of New Zealand, but is similar to that of New Guinea. That comes about because New Zealand is a volcanic oceanic island with no historical connection with Australia. Its animals have not come from Australia. On the other hand, New Guinea is an island on the same continental plate as Australia, and on the same side of the Wallace line. This was discovered by Alfred Russel Wallace, and explained in a famous series of books. These two huge islands were both part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, and were not (until modern times) inhabited by animals from Asia. As Gondwana broke up, its two main pieces had marsupial mammals. Eutherian mammals had not arrived from Eurasia. \nThis high level of endemism is explained by the continent's long geographic isolation and its tectonic stability (few earthquakes, volcanoes and recent mountain formations). Australia has few placental mammals. Marsupials occupy many of the ecological niches which placental animals occupy elsewhere in the world.\nMarsupials are a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums and dasyuromorphs. \nAustralia is home to two of the five known species of monotremes and has numerous venomous species, which include the platypus, spiders, scorpions, octopus, jellyfish, molluscs, stonefish, and stingrays. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of snakes.\nThe settlement of Australia by Indigenous Australians was between 48,000 and 70,000 years ago. Research in 2011 using DNA suggested an arrival around 50,000 years ago. Europeans came from 1788, and significantly affected the fauna. Hunting, the introduction of non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to many extinctions. Some historical examples include the paradise parrot, pig-footed bandicoot and the broad-faced potoroo. Unsustainable land use still threatens the survival of many species. To protect the survival of its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established protected areas."}

The targets that flash wrong are friendly, losing points.\nAll of this allows games to be stored on any format, not just VHS, as long as the video is made to work with the light gun.\nGames.\nFive VHS tapes came out for the system:\nA planned sixth cassette, \"Fright Night\" (possibly based on the 1985 horror movie of the same name), did not come out because the Action Max was discontinued."}

Generally non-metallic oxides are acidic and metallic oxides are basic. Some non-metallic oxides are neutral and some metallic or semi metallic oxides are amphoteric. There are a number of exceptions to these generalizations.\nWhat are Amphoteric Oxides?\n\"\u201cAmphoteric oxides are the oxides that behave as both acidic and basic oxides. Amphoteric Oxides have features of acidic as well as basic oxides that neutralize both acids and bases.\u201d\"\nAmphoteric oxides dissolve in water to form alkaline solutions. Alkaline solutions contain hydroxide ions. Thus aluminium oxide (Al2O3) reacts with hydrochloric acid to form aluminium chloride and water. With sodium hydroxide solution it forms sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) and water. Other common examples of amphoteric oxides include ZnO, SnO and PbO.\nHow to Identify Amphoteric Oxides?\nOxides are compounds of metals or nonmetals with oxygen. There are four types of oxide. Amphoteric oxides are classified as metal oxides that react with both acids as well as bases to create salts and water. Amphoteric oxides, among many others, include lead oxide and zinc oxide. Examples include amino acids and proteins that have classes of amine and carboxylic acids and molecules that can be self-ionized, such as water.\nAmphoteric oxides are oxygen compounds that show both acidic and basic characteristics. These oxides undergo a neutralisation reaction to form water and salt as they react with acid. This demonstrates the essential properties of the compounds. Similarly, the alkali reacts to the formation of salt and water, demonstrating an acidic property. \"Example:\" oxide of aluminium.\nAll of the oxides can be made by heating the element in oxygen. Reaction of aqueous solutions of the metal trihalides with hydroxide gives the oxides in hydrated form. Going down the group, there is a transition from acidic oxides, through amphoteric to basic owing to increasing metallic character of the elements concerned.\nAmphoteric Oxides Examples.\nThe word amphoteric means both of them acid and base. Amphoteric oxides have both acidic and basic properties. The oxides of aluminium and zinc are examples. They form salts when they react with acids. They also react with alkalis to form complex salts.\nExamples:\nZnO(s) + 2HNO3(aq) \u2192 Zn(NO3)2(aq) + H2O(l)\nZnO(s) + 2NaOH(aq) \u2192 Na2ZnO2(aq) + H2O(l)\nAl2O3(s) + 6HCl(aq) \u2192 2AlCl3(aq) + 3H2O(l)\nAl2O3(s) + 2NaOH(aq) \u2192 2NaAlO2(aq) + H2O(l)\nThe zincates and aluminates have the ending -ate to show that their ions are compound ions containing oxygen \u2013 rather like sulfates, carbonates and nitrates, indicating ions are ZnO22- and aluminate ions are AlO2\u2013. Ions are written as Zn(OH)42- and Al(OH)4\u2013. Note that sodium zincate and aluminate are soluble in water."}

He soon married into the family, became good friends with Robbins, and the two men decided to go into the ice cream business. At the suggestion of Robbins' father, however, they each opened separate stands, so that each man could better understand the responsibilities of running their own business. Baskin opened his Burton's ice cream stand in 1945, while Robbins opened a shop called Snowbird. They each had several stores by the time they merged in 1948, forming the company that was renamed Baskin-Robbins in 1953.\nThe company had 43 stores by the end of 1949, more than 100 by 1960 and about 500 when the ice cream empire was sold to United Fruit Company for an estimated $12 million in 1967. Robbins stayed involved with the company for 11 more years and retired in 1978. Twenty-five years later, Baskin-Robbins had become the world's largest chain of ice cream stores, with 5,500 outlets around the world.\nBaskin died from a heart attack at his home in Studio City, California on December 24, 1967."}

Harper Collins published it. Unlike most of Terry Pratchett's books, it is set in a world that is like the real world and not a fantasy world. Pratchett wrote \"Nation\" for children to read.\nSetting.\nThe world of \"Nation\" has an England and a France in it. It also has a \"Pelagic Ocean\", which is not really the Pacific Ocean. The story is set in the 1860s.\nPlot.\nMost of the story happens on an island in the \"Southern Pelagic Ocean\" after a giant wave kills almost all of the people who lived there. The people who lived on the island, and their culture, are \"the Nation\".\nThe main character, a teenager named Mau, was on a canoe trip when the wave came, so he did not die. He comes back home to the island to find everyone gone. The other main character, an English girl called Daphne, was shipwrecked on the island by the wave. Soon, other people from other islands show up. Mau, Daphne, and the new people rebuild the Nation together.\nMeanwhile, the King of England and most of his family have died in an epidemic. Daphne's father is the next person in line to be King of England. There is an English ship looking for Daphne and her father.\nMau had been on a trip to the Boys' Island to become a man. In the Nation, boys go to the island for thirty days to live alone. When they come back, they are given a ceremony that makes them men. The ceremony has a feast, tattoos, and ritual circumcision. The boy is supposed to leave his \"boy's soul\" on the boy's island, sail home, and then get a \"man's soul\" after his feast.\nBecause Mao is in between being a boy and a man, he thinks he has no soul. Mao often thinks that he is like a hermit crab that has left one shell but not found another one yet. Because of this, Mao and other people wonder if demons and other evil spirits will get into Mao's body.\nMau believes he can hear the voices of \"the Grandfathers\", who are old men whose spirits watch over the Nation. They order him around telling him to rebuild the Nation's god-anchors (altars) and perform the rituals and chants that made up the culture. Many of the characters in the book ask whether God or the gods are real because they allowed a bad thing to happen: the wave that killed so many people. Mau often says he doesn't think the gods exist, but he can see the god of death, Locaha, who talks to him.\nOn the island, Mau, Daphne, and the refugees rebuild the farm and buildings on the island, defeat raiders and mutineers, and discover an underground museum that Mau's ancestors built. Daphne believes that the island had once been much bigger during the Ice Age and that the Nation's ancestors could build telescopes, eyeglasses, metal tools and ships that could sail long distances. Daphne believes that many of the stories and songs that Mau has told her are really about planets and sailing around the world.\nDaphne's father comes to the Nation looking for Daphne. Then the ship from England comes to the island looking for Daphne's father, and they crown him king of England.\nMau and the other people in the Nation decide that they do not want to become part of the British Empire. Instead, they ask to join the Royal Society, the group of British scientists founded by Isaac Newton. Mau says any scientist from any other nation may come to the Nation to look at the very old museum. These scientists will pay the people of the Nation by teaching them everything they know.\nIn an epilogue, the last chapter of the book, it is the twenty-first century. The Nation is full of scientists but has kept its own culture. An old man tells two young children of the Nation about Mau and Daphne and how to use an old telescope.\nCritical response.\nJames Hynes of the \"New York Times\" thought the book was good. He liked the characters, the story, and the way the book looked at the way powerful countries treat smaller countries and religion. He called it \"both a high-spirited yarn and a subtle examination of the risks and virtues of faith.\"\nZack Handlen of \"The AV Club\" thought the book was mostly good but had a few problems. He liked the story and characters and Terry Pratchett's use of humanism, which is a way of thinking about society.\n\"Nation\" won many awards:"}

{"id": "836205", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=836205", "title": "Mazama", "text": "A brocket deer is the species of deer in the genus Mazama. Medium to small in size, and are found in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Central and South America, and the island of Trinidad. Most species are primarily found in forests. They are superficially similar to the African duikers and the Asian muntjacs, but unrelated. About 10 species of brocket deer are described.\nThe genus name \"Mazama\" is derived from Nahuatl \"mazame\", the plural of \"mazatl\" \"deer\". The common English name \"brocket\" (from French \"brocart\" &lt; \"broche\", spindle) comes from the word for a stag in its second year, with unbranched antlers.\nTaxonomy.\nThe taxonomy among \"Mazama\" species has changed significantly in the last decades, and as recently as 1999, some authorities only recognized four species. These four \"species\", \"M. americana\", \"M. gouazoubira\", \"M. rufina\", and \"M. chunnyi\", included several distinct populations that subsequently were elevated to species status, resulting in a total of nine different species being recognized in \"Mammal Species of the World\" in 2005. A tenth species, \"M. nemorivaga\", has traditionally been included in \"M. gouazoubira\", but this was shown to be mistaken in 2000. \"M. nemorivaga\" was not recognized as a separate species in \"Mammal Species of the World\", but this was apparently in error. Yet another species, the fair brocket (\"M. tienhoveni\"), has recently been described from the lower Amazon basin. What may be an undescribed small species of brocket with a reddish coat and blackish legs has been photographed in the lowlands of Man\u00fa National Park in Peru, and based on sight records may also occur in northwestern Bolivia.\nMolecular dating suggests that the family Cervidae originated and radiated in central Asia during the Late Miocene, and that the Odocoileini dispersed to North America during the Miocene/Pliocene boundary and underwent an adaptive radiation in South America after their Pliocene dispersal across the Isthmus of Panama. According to the systematic relationships and evolutionary history of neotropical deer, at least eight ancestral forms of deer invaded South America during the late Pliocene (2.5\u20133 Mya), and members of the red brockets had an independent early explosive diversification soon after their ancestor arrived there, giving rise to a number of morphologically cryptic species.\nDeer endemic to the New World fall in two biogeographic lineages: the first, which includes genus \"Odocoileus\" and \"Mazama americana\", is distributed in North, Central, and South America, whereas the second is composed of South American species only and includes \"Mazama gouazoubira\". This implies that the genus \"Mazama\" is not a monophyletic taxon. Genetic analysis reveals high levels of molecular and cytogenetic divergence between groups of morphologically similar species of brockets (\"Mazama\") and suggests a polyphyletic origin. In particular, \"M. americana\" showed a striking kinship with \"Odocoileus\" on the basis of several DNA sequences, in contrast to that expected, since this \"M. americana\" (now \"M. temama\") haplotype, of Mexican origin, was not close to several Bolivian \"Mazama\" sequences analyzed. Thus, \"Mazama\" as traditionally circumscribed may not be monophyletic. These Bolivian \"Mazama\" species were instead grouped with \"Pudu puda\" and \"Ozotoceros bezoarticus\". This could be explained by various possibilities, among them the existence of common ancestral haplotypes among the species or the need for a revised phylogenetic tree, with revised placement into true monophyletic genera that better reflect the true ancestry.\nPhysical description and habitat.\nDepending on species, brocket deer are small to medium-sized with stout bodies and large ears. The head-and-body length is , the shoulder height is , and the typical weight , though exceptionally large \"M. americana\" specimens have weighed as much as . When present, the antlers are small, simple spikes. The pelage varies from reddish to brown to gray. Very roughly, the species can be divided into four groups based on size, color, and habitat (but not necessarily matching their phylogeny):\nBehavior.\nIn addition to being small and nocturnal, \"Mazama\" species are shy and are thus rarely observed. They are found living alone or in mated pairs within their own small territory, the boundaries usually marked with urine, feces, or secretions from the eye glands. When threatened by predators (primarily the cougar and the jaguar), they use their knowledge of their territory to finding hiding places in nearby vegetation. As herbivores, their diet consists of leaves, fruits, and shoots.\nReproduction.\nMated pairs that live together remain monogamous. Single male deer usually mate with nearby females. When males compete for a mate, they fight by biting and stabbing with their short antlers. Brocket species that live in tropical areas have no fixed mating season, but those in temperate areas have a distinct rutting period in the autumn.\nThe gestation period is roughly 200\u2013220 days and females bear only one fawn at a time. The young stay with the mother, keeping concealed until large enough to accompany her. They are normally weaned around six months of age and reach sexual maturity after a year."}

People go to the wind phone to say things to their family members or friends who have died. It was built by Itaru Sasaki, a garden designer, in 2010, after his cousin died. In 2011, after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people in the area, he opened the wind phone so everyone could use it. Over 30,000 people have gone there since then. People have built copies in different countries, and there are books and movies about it.\nBackground.\nIn 2010, Itaru Sasaki, a garden designer from \u014ctsuchi, learned that his cousin had cancer and had three months to live. After his cousin died, Sasaki built an old telephone booth in his garden in December 2010, so that he could feel a connection to his cousin by \"talking\" to him on the phone. He said that the wind phone was not related to religion, but helped him deal with the loss. He also said that he wanted his thoughs to be \"carried on the wind\".\nThe wind phone is a white telephone booth with glass windows. Inside, there is a black telephone on a metal shelf. The telephone is not connected to anything. Next to the telephone, there is a book so visitors can write notes about the people that they miss.\nOpening.\nIn 2010, a tsunami killed over 15,000 people in the area, including over 1,200 people in the town where Sasaki lived. After the tsunami, he opened the wind phone so that everyone could call their friends and family who had died. Now, it has been visited by over 30,000 people.\nOn January 7, 2017, strong winds ripped off the roof of the wind phone and broke the glass doors. People in the area quickly helped to fix it on January 10, and the wind phone was fixed by the next day. In April 2018, Sasaki said that the wood and metal parts of the booth were damaged, and that he wanted to build a new booth that would not be damaged as fast. People gave money to buy a new booth, and Sasaki built the new, stronger booth in August 2018.\nCopies.\nMany copies of the wind phone have been built around the world. In Oakland, California, artist Jordan Stern built a wind telephone in February 2017, to remember the 36 people who died in the 2016 Oakland warehouse fire, including his friend.\nAltr\u00fachas, an art group in Dublin, Ireland, built a wind phone (\"f\u00f3n gaoithe\") on a mountain named Two Rock in August 2017. The wind phone was built from old supplies, and they were not actually allowed to build it. It was destroyed for unknown reasons less than two weeks after it was set up. Altr\u00fachas later said that the destruction was \"a strong statement from people that didn't like the project\", but that they would not let it \"take away from the positivity of the project\".\nTomohiko and Kazuko Kutsuna, a married couple in Aichi Prefecture in Japan, built a red copy of the wind phone in 2018. It was called the \"phone of the sea breeze\" (\"shiokaze no denwa\"), and it was built to remember of one of Kazuko's students, an 18-year-old woman who died by suicide in 2009.\nTen local artists helped to build a temporary wind phone in January 2020 in Provincetown, Massachusetts. In October 2020, Susan Vetrone and Steve Reed built a wind phone in North Carolina. Vetrone started the project when her mother died and she learned about the \u014ctsuchi wind phone, saying: \"I wanted it to mirror \u2013 almost exactly if it could \u2013 the Japanese phone booth that brought so many people comfort.\"\nIn March 2021, a wind phone was built on Aspen Mountain in Colorado. According to the artist, who did not give their name because they were not allowed to build it in a United States national forest, the wind phone was built to help people deal with deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn books and movies.\nBooks.\nSasaki, who built the \u014ctsuchi wind phone, wrote a book titled \"Kaze no Denwa \u2013 Daishinsai Kara Rokunen, Kaze no Denwa o Tooshite Mieru Koto\" (\"The Phone of the Wind: What I Have Seen via the Phone in the Six Years Since the Earthquake\") in 2017. The book was published by Kazama Shobo.\nThe 2020 book \"The Phone Box at the Edge of the World\" by Italian writer Laura Imai Messina tells the story of a woman who loses her family in the T\u014dhoku tsunami and goes to the wind phone, where she meets a man and his daughter who have also lost a family member in the tsunami. The book was based by Messina's visit to the \u014ctsuchi wind phone in 2011.\n\"The Phone Booth in Mr. Hirota's Garden\", a 2020 book by Canadian writer Heather Smith, is a fiction version of the wind phone's story. Smith said that she wanted to write the book after she heard a National Public Radio podcast about the wind phone. She emailed Sasaki while she wrote the book, and said that it \"was a thrill to receive his blessing.\"\nMovies.\nThe 2019 Austrian short movie \"The Wind Phone\", written and directed by Kristin Gerweck, is about seven fictional strangers who visit the Japanese wind phone. Gerweck wrote the movie when she learned about the wind phone after her grandmother's death, saying that it was a \"beautiful story\".\n\"Voices in the Wind\" () is a 2020 Japanese drama movie about a fictional high school student whose family died in the T\u014dhoku tsunami and who goes back to her town to visit the wind phone years later. The movie director Nobuhiro Suwa, who went back to Japan to make the movie, stated: \"Going there eight years later, you can't see much of the damage, it has been rebuilt. But people's feelings have not been fixed.\""}

The pioneering work in archeology was initiated by O. Kumar Singh. Before his presence, there was little information on the existence of the stone culture of Manipur.\nO. Kumar Singh is of the view that \"Pre-Historic people used to settle in the hills during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic (Hoabinhian) culture while Neolithic people lived in both hills and valley. They came down to the valley at least by about 2000\u00a0BC.\" On the basis of the characters of the tool industry, the prehistory of Manipur is broadly classified into three periods.\nPaleolithic period.\nPaleolithic period is the most primitive stone culture era. The Paleolithic period varies from place to place.\nIn Manipur's neighbouring country Burma (Myanmar), the lower Paleolithic culture started from 750000 to 275000 BP. The Homo erectus (early Anyathian culture) began to settle on the banks of the Ayeyawaddy river in Burma in 750000 BCE.\nHowever, in case of Manipur, Paleolithic period started from 20,000 to 10,000 BCE.\nThe stone culture of Paleolithic period were discovered from the five archeological sites, Songbu, Khangkhui, Machi, Nongpok Keithel Manbi and Singtom.\nMesolithic period.\nThe Mesolithic period (Hoabinhian period or post Paleolithic period or pre Neolithic period) has two remarkable archeological sites in Manipur. These are the Nongpok Keithelmanbi and the Tharon cave.\nNeolithic period.\nThe Neolithic period is the last of the three Stone Age periods. It has 4 archeological sites in Manipur.\nThese are (1) Napachik, (2) Laimanai, (3) Phunan, (4) Nongpok Keithelmanbi."}

{"id": "836401", "revid": "766335", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=836401", "title": "Probus (emperor)", "text": "Probus (19 August 232 \u2013 September 282) was Roman emperor from 276 to 282.\nEarly life.\nProbus () was born in Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) in the Balkans, part of the Roman Empire. The \"Calendar of Philocalus\" (a Latin calendar), the \"Chronicon Paschale\" (a Greek chronicle), and the work of the Greek historian John Malalas all say that Probus was born on 19 August 232.\nThe \"Historia Augusta\" (a Latin history) says that Probus's father's name was Maximus. However, another Latin history, the \"Epitome de Caesaribus\", says that Probus's father's name was Dalmatius. The \"Epitome de Caesaribus\" also says this Dalmatius was part of the family of the emperor Claudius Gothicus. Neither the \"Historia Augusta\" nor the \"Epitome de Caesaribus\" are correct, and this information in both histories is fiction. The \"Historia Augusta\" also says that Probus had the name Valerius, which is not true.\nProbus was a soldier in the Roman army. The \"Historia Augusta\" says that Probus was in the army in the time of Valerian, and that Probus worked in the area of the Danube. \"Historia Augusta\" also says that Probus was in the army that fought against the emperors' enemies in Roman Africa and the Palmyrene Empire. (This information is probably not correct.)\nIn the time of the emperor Marcus Claudius Tacitus, Probus was probably a governor of the East ().\nEmperor.\nIn summer 276, probably in July, Probus became emperor. At the time, he was in the eastern empire. (The \"Historia Augusta\" says that Probus became emperor in January that year, but this is not correct.)\nProbus was Roman consul for the first time in 277. The writing of the Justinianic Code may mean that Probus was in Sirmium on 5 May 277. From 277 to 278, Probus fought a war against the Germanic peoples. In 277, Probus got the name because of his successes against the Goths.\nProbus was Roman consul for the second time in 278 and consul for the third time in 279. In 279, Probus fought wars against the Isaurians in Asia Minor and against the Blemmyes in Roman Egypt. From October 279, Probus had the names , , (or ) because of his successes against the Goths, against other Germanic peoples, and against the Sasanian Empire (the Persians).\nBetween 280 and 281, there was a civil war in Roman Europe. Bonosus and Proculus made themselves emperors. The \"Historia Augusta\" says that this was at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne), but this may not be correct. Not long after this, Probus's armies overcame the armies of Proculus and Bonosus at Colonia Agrippina. Bonosus may have killed himself and Probus may have executed Proculus.\nProbus was Roman consul for the fourth time in 281. In around 281, there was a rebellion in Roman Britain. The rebellion was stopped for Probus by Victorinus. The Latin histories of Jerome say that around 281, there was another rebellion in Antioch. There, Saturninus made himself emperor. The Greek historian Zosimus wrote that Saturninus was the governor of Roman Syria. Jerome wrote that soldiers in Saturninus's army murdered him at Apamea in Roman Syria.\nAround the end of 281, Probus held a triumph in Rome. Probus was Roman consul for the fifth time in 282.\nDeath.\nSoldiers of the Roman army murdered Probus at Sirmium in autumn 282, probably in August or September. The \"Historia Augusta\" says that he was buried in a mausoleum in Sirmium.\nThere may have been a \"damnatio memoriae\" on Probus, and the Romans removed his name from some inscriptions. Later however, possibly in the time of the emperor Diocletian, the Romans deified Probus (making him into a god). He got a new name in .\nFamily.\nThe \"Historia Augusta\" says that Probus had a sister with the name Claudia. This may be fiction."}

These parts could be loosely united as an Iraqi federation or be three separate independent countries.\nSupport for this idea.\nSupport for the idea of dividing Iraq into three (or more) separate parts came from various prominent Americans and Iraqis, including Joe Biden, Leslie H. Gelb, Edward P. Joseph, Michael E. O'Hanlon, Khamis Khanjar, Atheel al-Nujaifi, Rafaa al-Issawi, Ali Khedery, John Bolton, and Michael J. Totten.\nCriticism of this idea.\nThe idea of dividing Iraq has been criticized by Ben Connable. Connable said that none of Iraq's major groups or political factions actually want to divide Iraq and that neither do the Iraqi people. Connable also says that Iran (Iraq's most influential neighbor) does not want to see Iraq get divided and that the United States can't actually do anything to force Iraqi politicians to agree to divide their country into three (or more) separate parts. Connable also says that the new independent countries in the area will be unable to work together if Iraq is divided and that the violence and ethnic cleansing in a partitioned Iraq is likely to be even worse than it is right now. (In a separate article, Robert Mackey likewise argues that the idea of partitioning territories did not have a very good track record in Ireland, India, and Palestine and is thus unlikely to work very well in Iraq either.) Connable also doubts that an independent Shi'a Arab state in southern Iraq would actually want to share any of its oil revenues with a poor, landlocked, and backward independent Sunni Arab state in western Iraq."}

SCOTUS also disliked the fact that the Florida recount was limited to undervotes (rather than having \"all of\" Florida's ballots be manually recounted) and said that there was no time for a new recount in Florida since Florida's Supreme Court said that the Florida state legislature wanted Florida to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" deadline on December 12, 2000.\nIn \"Bush v. Gore\", seven Justices (everyone other than Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens) agreed that there were Equal Protection problems with Florida's recount, five Justices (everyone other than Ginsburg, Stevens, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer) said that there was no time for a new Florida recount, and three Justices (Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas) went a step further than this by saying that in addition to violating the Equal Protection Clause, Florida's Supreme Court also violated Article II of the United States Constitution by changing Florida's election laws.\nSCOTUS's \"Bush v. Gore\" ruling got a lot of criticism but was also defended in a long 2001 law review article by George Mason University law professor Nelson Lund."}

It was published in 1929, shortly after Coolidge left office.\nCoolidge's autobiography has about 45,000 words, unusually short for the time. It was praised by Ray Long (editor of \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine) for describing the complete story of Coolidge's life and \"the complete story of our country during the dramatic years of this generation.\" Coolidge was one of the first U.S. Presidents to write and publish an autobiography. Coolidge's autobiography talks about all of the important moments in his life, such as his childhood and youth, Governorship, Presidency, son's death, and retirement. It was criticized by some for being too obvious and not giving any new information that was previously unknown to the public. However, this trait of the autobiography was not that surprising as no one expected Coolidge to reveal some private government information and secrets in his autobiography (Coolidge was a very private man, despite his happy-going and cheerful public personality image). However, it was also praised for its relative shortness, considering that most autobiographies of the time were much longer. Coolidge's autobiography, in contrast, was about half the size of a novel. One of the most important moments in the book was Coolidge's belief that President Warren Harding would recover (in 1923) and then his surprise and inauguration following Harding's death.\nThe Coolidge autobiography was very popular when it was published, which is seen in the large amount of fan mail that Coolidge got afterwards and by the fact that many newspapers were willing to publish parts of the autobiography so that much more Americans could buy it and view it. Coolidge said that he hoped that his autobiography might guide and encourage the young men and women of America."}

Non-existent in Namibia before the 19th century, Jews played an important if minor role in the history of Namibia since that point in time, despite the fact that their population was always small. The most famous Namibian Jew was \"businessman, philanthropist and Jewish communal leader\" Harold Pupkewitz (1915\u20132012).\nHistory (19th century-1965).\nIn the mid-19th century, Jewish businessmen from Cape Town named the De Pass brothers became the first Jews in what is now Namibia when they established a trading post on the Nawaqualand Coast. The De Pass brothers began the Pomona Copper Company in Pomona, Namibia in 1861. After Namibia became a German colony in the late 19th century, more Jews came to Namibia for business, et cetera. However, under German rule, only about 100 Jews lived in Namibia, most of whom lived in Swakopmund. After the German defeat in World War I, the newly created League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate over Namibia. The Jewish population of Namibia (which had close relations with the Jews in South Africa) began increasing after this point, and there were 400 to 500 Jews living in Namibia (mostly in Windhoek) in 1965 (however, Jews were still less than one percent of the total White population in Namibia during this time).\nHistory (1965\u2013present).\nBecause the League of Nations mandate for Namibia was cancelled by the United Nations and the fact that Namibia became independent, the Jewish population in Namibia dramatically declined since 1965, with only 60 to 100 Jews living in Namibia today. In spite of this very low number of Jews, Windhoek \"has a Hebrew congregation dating from 1917, a synagogue built in 1925, a Talmud Torah, a communal hall, an active Zionist movement supported by generous contributions, and the only Jewish minister in the territory.\" Other than at Windhoek, the only other place in Namibia today where Jews live in is Keetmanshoop, where about twelve Jewish families currently live."}

Tillman was the President of the Chancel Choir for 15 years and the church Secretary for 13 years. Since she could not find a job as a regular secretary due to discrimination, she had a career in catering, including baking cakes for both Katharine Hepburn's father and Jackie Robinson. Tillman's husband died in 1939, before the United States's entry into World War II, and she also outlived one of her two daughters. However, all of her Emma Tillman's siblings who moved to the Northern United States with her in 1900 ended up living beyond the age of 100.

Actual idealism is the idea that reality is the ongoing act of thinking. Any action done by humans is classified as human thought because the action was done due to predisposed thought. He further believes that thoughts are the only concept that truly exist since reality is defined through the act of thinking.\nSince thoughts are actions, any idea formed on the basis of incomplete information is still valid, and can become law, as this idea not only affects the individual's life, but everyone around them, which in turn affects the state since the people are the state. Therefore, thoughts of each person are subsumed within the state. The state is a composition of many minds that come together to change the country for better or worse.\nGentile theorizes that thoughts can only be formed on the basis of incomplete information within the bounds of known reality; abstract thinking does not exist. Thoughts cannot be formed outside our known reality because we are the reality that halt ourselves from thinking externally. With accordance to \"The Act of Thought of Pure Thought\", our actions comprise our thoughts, our thoughts create perception, perceptions define reality, thus we think within our created reality.\nThe present act of thought is reality but the past is not reality; it is history. The reason being, past can be rewritten through present knowledge and perspective of the event. The reality that is currently constructed can be completely changed through language (e.g. bias (omission, source, tone)). The unreliability of the recorded reality can skew the original concept and make the past remark unreliable. Actual idealism is regarded as a liberal and tolerant doctrine since it acknowledges that every being picturizes reality, in which their ideas remained hatched, differently. Even though, reality is a figment of thought.\nEven though core concept of the theory is famous for its simplification, its application is regarded as extremely ambiguous."}

The empire grew out of the former civilizations of Funan and Chenla, and at times ruled over and/or vassalized most of mainland Southeast Asia and parts of Southern China, its control stretching from the tip of the Indochinese Peninsula northward to modern Yunnan province, China, and from Vietnam westward to Myanmar.\nA notable achievement is the site of Angkor, which is located in present-day Cambodia, the Khmer capital when the empire was the greatest. The majestic monuments of Angkor, such as Angkor Wat and Bayon, show the Khmer Empire's immense power, wealth, art, culture, architectural technique, aesthetics achievements, and the variety of belief systems that the Khmer Empire had over time. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor was the largest pre-industrial urban center in the world during the Khmer Empire's peak in the 11th to 13th centuries.\nThe beginning of the era of the Khmer Empire is conventionally dated to 802 when King Jayavarman II declared himself \"chakravartin\" (\"universal ruler\", title equivalent to \"emperor\") on Phnom Kulen.

He moved to Kawasaki shortly after Yasuda was born and was evacuated when he was in the sixth grade from the . Yasuda then moved to (also known as Kakio, Kawasaki City), where his mother's parents' home lived, and failed his grades when he was in the first year of the old . Aspiring to become a soldier, Yasuda applied to the , but due to his fail grades, he changed his career to the path of music and learned to used the cornet by himself.\nWhile attending the new year at the Atsugi High School, Yasuda founded the brass band club, was in charge of the alto saxophone, and served as the principal. During his first year of high school, he was planning on attending for the University of Tokyo or the Hitotsubashi University, but when Yasuda was in the third year of high school, he became interested in music and in 1951, he went to the Department of Instruments at the . However, Yasuda was not used to the feudal nature of the classical music world, and due to financial difficulties to keep paying a large monthly fee, he started a part-time job as a jazzman at an expeditionary force club.\nFinally, when the Instrumentation Department was established at Tokyo University of the Arts, it was moved there and completed in 1953. Since then, Yasuda has been active as a jazzman in Yokohama, Yokosuka, and . Yasuda latter meet both \u00catar\u00f4 Ishibashi and during the his trip in Yokohama.

With a serious personality, he was the only member to appear in \"Adult Manga\" 1,835 times. Also, in \"Shabontama Holiday\", he was known for his role as \"Deputy Director of the Kintoto Movie Studio\", a contender who teamed up with Osami Nabe, and kept yelling \"Yasuda!\" In the end. He also plays the role of reversing his position. Also, the method of playing the saxophone while making the bridge is also famous, and it is shown on stage and in some Crazy Movies.\nDue to his serious personality, Yasuda was concerned about his lack of talent, and one of the people involved (including songwriter ) even said, \"Shin Yasuda is a crazy baggage.\" He was seriously thought about retiring once, but a friend said, \"You're like the University of Tokyo at six baseball colleges.\" It's luggage that Yasuda just lost, but he hope to do something someday, so it's interesting for all six universities.\"\nHe also an actor and appeared in many movies and television programs.

{"id": "836799", "revid": "656019", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=836799", "title": "LZ77 and LZ78", "text": "LZ77 and LZ78 are two different types of lossless data compression algorithms. They were both published in papers by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1977 and 1978. Both of these types of algorithm, LZ77 and LZ78, are mainly designed to compress data without destroying the contents of the data when decompressed. Like all data compression algorithms, LZ77 and LZ78 both use a process called \"data compression\", or just \"compression\". Additionally, LZ77 and LZ78 both have their own processes for decompression (a type of process which reverses compression).\nLZW is an improved version of LZ78.\nLZ78.\nLZ78 is an algorithm that has two variants of itself, LZ78 compression and LZ78 decompression.\nLZ78 compression.\nIn LZ78 compression, this algorithm does compression by replacing repeated occurrences of data with references to a dictionary. The dictionary used for this algorithm is built based on the input data stream. The dictionary stores tuples that represent a set of characters that were part of the input data stream. Each index of a dictionary contains a tuple and its respective character. A tuple stored in an index of the dictionary contains a certain index of the dictionary and a character. Each dictionary item with its respective tuple will be represented as codice_1. Within this type of tuple, the index refers to a point in the dictionary where there is an occurrence of a duplicated part of the dictionary. \nIf the algorithm finds a unique character not yet found in the dictionary, then a new dictionary entry is added and the index for that new dictionary entry is set to 0. Otherwise, if there is already a dictionary entry, the algorithm just lists a new dictionary entry with an index equal to an existing dictionary entry's index and the character becomes whatever the following character is. Afterwards, a value representing each recorded tuple is stored into a file. The entire process continues until all characters in the input data stream are read.\nExample of using LZ78 compression.\nSuppose the string in the input data stream is \"abbaaaabbbbccabcbaaa\".\nWhenever doing LZ78 compression, the dictionary always starts out empty. Any new entries will start at the first index. The \"empty\" index is actually the 0th index.\nAgain, a dictionary contains a set of indexes. Its indexes each contain a tuple that represents a certain value. After LZ78 compression is done, the dictionary should end up like this:\nAfter each time a certain section of the input data stream has been read, a representation of the currently recorded tuple will be stored into the file. The information stored into the file should end up looking like this:\nLZ78 decompression.\nIn LZ78 decompression, the process is reversed. Instead of taking a string of many characters, LZ78 decompression scans a file containing a series of stored values. These stored values represent tuples that were featured in LZ78 compression. Like LZ78 compression, LZ78 decompression uses a dictionary to record values. In LZ78 decompression, it will take information that was stored in a file and then record these values into a dictionary. Once all values are added into the dictionary, the program will refer to the dictionary. From there, the program will convert each line of the file into a certain value. That value is determined from converting each line of the file into a tuple. This tuple is stored into the dictionary and will contain a dictionary index and a letter, just as it does in LZ78 compression."}

He was a boarding captain during the Boshin War and commanded the paddle corvette \"Kaiten\" where he is killed during the Battle of Miyako Bay. \nLife.\nBorn on February 16, 1839 in the Kakegawa Domain, he is the fourth child of Hidetaka Koga, leader of the Kakegawa Clan in Totomi. In 1855, Gengo traveled to Edo and studied Rangaku with daimyo of the Sakura Domain, Guntaro Kimura. He returned to his province two years later in 1857, but in 1858, Gengo was aspired to study navigation and went back to Edo under the guidance of K\u014d Yatabori, who was the professor at the Gunkan Office in Tsukiji. Since 1855, the 2nd Dutch Navy Training Mission, led by Willem Huyssen van Kattendijke, came to the Nagasaki to set up a naval training center.\nGengo's older brother, Gunnosuke Gengo, along with Katsu Kaishu and Yadabori, was the only Kakegawa feudal lord to receive the first Nagasaki Dutch Navy training. However, by the time of the second period, even though he had not accepted any new people other than the Bakushin, the fact that Gengo went to Nagasaki meant that he had an informal tour of the training as a subordinate of Yadabori.\nThen, Gengo studied advanced mathematics in Dutch with two of his mentors Yadabori and Arai Ikunosuke , and published a book about naval tactics. He also learned both English and French. In 1859, he became a vassal of the Shogunate and was appointed as a warship training assistant. The following year, Gengo also served as a guardsman in Yokohama. In 1861, Gengo became professor of naval training.\nLife in the Shogunate Navy.\nHe was latter appointed as member of the warship club and surveyed the Edo Bay. The following year, the Shogunate Ogasawara Islands Inspection Team (\u5e55\u5e9c\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f\u8af8\u5cf6\u8996\u5bdf\u56e3, \"Bakufu Ogasawarashot\u014d shisatsu-dan\"), led by Mizuno Tadanori, boarded the Kanrin Maru to preserve the area as Japanese territory. Gengo commanded the sailing ship \"Sensh\u016b Maru\" to surveyed the area. He boarded the ship with Arai Ikunosuke as a surveyor of the sailing ship. It was difficult to cross the Pacific Ocean in winter with an old sailing ship, and the Sensh\u016b Maru was washed away and had a hard time. Although it is very short, there is a memorandum of Gengo at that time. In 1863, Gengo was ordered to survey the Osaka Bay by engaging in two round-trip voyages between Edo and Osaka to escort the young shogun, Tokugawa Iemochi. In May of that year, he was summoned to the warship group, and it became more prestigious.\nIn July 1863, during the Shimonoseki campaign, which began with the bombardment of the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain by Western forces (British Empire, United States, France and The Netherlands), Gengo headed for Shimonoseki with the messengers dispatched from the Shogunate to the Choshu while serving as the captain of the \"Ch\u014dy\u014d Maru\". According to a letter to his family, the messenger's mission was to dismiss the Choshu samurais because they occupied the Ogura Clan's territory, and the messenger headed for the Ogura clan territory succeeded this. The messenger who landed in Shimonoseki was killed by foreign soldiers. Gengo was forced by the Choshu Clan to borrowed his ship for the campaign, but he refused. In 1864, he was guarded according to the general's return to the sea route. In the First Ch\u014dsh\u016b expedition, he set sailed to Aki and Buzen. He became the captain of the \"Kish\u014d Maru\" and sailed to Osaka in 1866. \nIn 1867, Gengo was assigned to a fleet of small ten-person warships. That same year, the of the Royal Navy arrived at the warship training center, and as the training began on November 5, he became the head of the warship training center and also served as a student councilor on November 26. The Boshin War began when Imperial forces clashed with the Bakufu troops at Toba-Fushimi.\nBoshin War.\nGengo was promoted to as head of the Shogun naval fleet, but the Boshin War had already begun. After the surrender of Edo Castle, Katsu Kaishu had promised to hand over the warship to the Imperial government, but the Admiral of the Bakufu Navy Enomoto Takeaki refused to surrender, and the last remaining shogunate forces retreated including Arai Ikunosuke and Gengo. As a result of the negotiations, four warships, the \"Kaiyo Maru\", the \"Kaiten Maru\", the \"Banryu Maru\", and the \"Chiyodagata Maru\", was organized, but they were dissatisfied with the various measures taken by the new government. Enomoto decided to lead the fleet and escape after seeing the relocation of Muneya to Sunpu.\nOn August 19, the Shogunate fleet, whose flagship was the \"Kaiyo Maru\", carrying former Bakufu soldiers onboard the transport ship and departed off the coast of Shinagawa. At this time, Gengo was made captain of the \"Kaiten Maru\". The \"Kaiten Maru\" was towing the slow-moving \"Kaiyo Maru\", but was forced to cut the towline due to a typhoon off the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula. Due to the storm, the front and center masts were folded, leaving only the rear mast, but they arrived safely at Matsushima Bay of the formerly Sendai Domain, which was the creation of the \u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei. After that, the \"Kaiten Maru\" went north alone, and while the ship scouted the Kesen Port, they found \"Kaiten\" and captured it.\nA sailing ship owned by the former Shogunate that Koga boarded when he headed for the Ogasawara Islands, but was rented to the Sendai Domain. It was decided to be returned to the Tokugawa family, but it is said that the crew had taken it and engaged in piracy.\nIn September, the allies of the feudal clan surrendered one after another. The Shogun fleet carrying former Shogunate troops and other army units who still wanted to fight, headed for Hokkaido. Gengo was also among them the group as the captain of \"Kaiten Maru\".\nThe fleet arrived at Washinoki in the north of Hakodate on October 20, and the Battle of Hakodate began. The next day, the ship visited the Hakodate Port with thir consort ship \"Banryu Maru\", and on the 25th, troops and sailors of the Bakufu Army landed on the island and occupied each cities from Imperial Japanese troops. On the 27th, the Akita clan warship \"Kaohsiung Maru\", which did not know about it, arrived at the port, so Gengo had his fellow officers of both \"Kaiten Maru\" and \"Banryu Maru,\" lead a group of sailors and captured the Imperial ships, including the ironclad \"\". In a battle with soldiers of the Matsumae clan (who had sworn their allegiance to the new government), Gengo supported the Bakufu Army, and when the \"Kaiyo Maru\" sailed around in Esashi, he went to rescue them, but he couldn't save it at last. After many ships where destroyed by the modernized navy, \"Kaiten Maru\" became the last flagship of the Shogunate Navy.\nKilled in action and Afterwards.\nIn March 1869, after hearing reports of incoming Japanese forces plans to captured Hokkaido, Gengo leads a group of sailors (including Arai Ikunosuke and Hijikata Toshiz\u014d) and French Army advisors (including Jules Brunet, Arthur Fortant, Fran\u00e7ois Bouffier, Jean Marlin, and Pierre Garde). Gengo seems to have been the center of the operation because of the belief that \"Let's attack aggressively rather than waiting for the enemy\". The flagship \"Kaiten Maru\", commanded by Captain Gengo, arrived at Miyako Bay along with the \"Banryu Maru\" and \"Kaohsiung Maru\", but due to bad weather, the \"Banryu Maru\" strayed and the \"Kaohsiung Maru\" broke down. Only \"Kaiten Maru\" will enter the Battle of Miyako Bay. It had said that Gengo said in his final word before the attack, \"Even my ship is enough to defeat the enemy.\" \nGengo endured the inferiority and was fiercely commanding on the deck while being shot through the left foot and right arm by bullets, but as he charged at the sailors, he was shot through the head by a rifle bullet. He was 31 years old. The ship was taken command by Arai and retreated back to Hakodate on the 26th, and Gengo;s body was buried the next day. The place of his burial was a certain temple, but it is said that it was later reburied behind the Hekketsu-hi Monument. In 1931, his nephew and adopted child, Nobumasa K\u014dga, built a monument in the precincts of the Daikannon Light Source Temple in Komagome, Tokyo, near the former Kakegawa clan's residence.\nWorks.\nK\u014dga Gengo : Yoshir\u014d Ichikawa"}

The world's first film commercial was shown during the world exhibition.\nEnthusiastic about balloons, Eugene Mercier had an idea to consolidate the advertising of his company during the international exhibition. He secured a tethered balloon on the Field of Mars, loaded with bottles of champagne. During the 1900 World's Fair, the balloon was blown away by 20,000 people."}

{"id": "837007", "revid": "145452", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=837007", "title": "Chowkur", "text": "Chowkur is one the remotest Tibetan settlements surrounded by number of Indian Villages. It is in Taluk of Periyapatna of Mysuru District, Karnataka state in Southern India. Chowkur is small village specifically for the Tibetan refugees, who have escaped Tibet from Chinese Oppression in 1959. The area of the settlement is 5 km2 (4 sq. mi), which was allotted for first Tibetan refugees who migrated from North India. The pin code of Chowkur is 571107 of Periyapatna post. Chowkur has two camps with 80 houses\nHistory.\nChowkur was formed in 1975, when many Tibetan refugees moved from northern part of India. Around 500 Tibetan refugees were relocated to Chowkur from Northern part of India such as Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam. Chowkur has two Tibetan settlements known as Rabtenling and Phuntsokling, which is also known as camp one and two. The settlement is named after a nearby place called Anna Chowkur. Government of Karnataka has provided housing facilities and field for cultivation to Tibetans with the help of other NGOs for the survival. During the early years, many of them survived with collecting woods from the nearby forest for cooking and slowly developed by owning gases. The history of Tibetan refugees settled in Chowkur itself is the history of its people as many does not know much about this remote settlement, not even other Tibetans. The history of Chowkur is recollection of memories of first-generation Tibetan refugee and official records.\nPopulation.\nThe total population (2011) estimated is 700 number. Due to large number of Tibetan moving to west, the number of populations has been lessening. During the initial years, the population was less but, there was more birth rates in 80s and population increased. Today, the population can be estimated to 500 in decreasing number. The population record in Chowkur is collected by both Karnataka Government and CTA. The above estimated population record is referred in CTA population census. The population in other Tibetan settlement is more in number than Chowkur as the size of population has always been less.\nLanguage.\nThe Official Language spoken in the neighboring area is Kannada, but the native Tibetan language is spoken by the residents. Due to social integration with other Indians, most of the Tibetan living in Chowkur are also fluent in Kannada as well. The younger generation speak Tibetan and Kannada in the region. Kannada is mostly used to communicate with Indians.\nReligion.\nThe religion followed by Tibetan is Tibetan Buddhism. There is no single person from other religion live in this small remote settlement. Tibetan Buddhism was followed by first-generation Tibetans and was ascribed to their children and grandchildren. Chowkur has its own small area for prayers and to conduct religious activities. Most of the prayers are done in their respective homes as everyone reserves on room in their home as prayer room. \nAdministration.\nChowkur does not have any official office in its function. It is officially under Periyapatna Taluk but, the functioning office is in Bylakuppe under Central Tibetan Administration. Chowkur is registered officially under Indian Government but, the welfare of the people is looked by the branch of CTA office. Thus, Chowkur is associated with both Indian and Tibetan administration for its functioning. Both the functioning offices looks after the welfare of Chowkur. The electricity and water were provided by the Taluk Office and other needs were look after by CTA (Office in Bylakuppe). Thus, the school and nursery were looked after by the CTA.\nAccessibility.\nIn the past, Tibetans used to go to the nearest market or bus stand by walk but, today the facilities have been improved. One can reach from Periyapatna bus stand. From Periyapatna, one must go by auto as Chowkur does not have bus facilities. It is 5 kms away from the nearest town, which is also a taluk of Chowkur. It takes 2 hours to reach Chowkur from Mysuru district. The nearest bus stand is Periyapatna, and nearest railway station is Mysuru Railway station. Chowkur does not have any Government transportation facilities and people use self-owned vehicle to travel to other places. On the west of Chowkur, there is another small village known as Panchavalli and one can reach Chowkur via Gonnikoppa. There is no direct bus or other public transportation to reach Chowkur from other towns or cities. So, the accessibility to Chowkur may seems little confusing to first visitors.\nFacilities.\n1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Nursery and School:\nChowkur has small School and nursery for its children. The school opened in 1984 and nursery in 1982 with 10 students. The facilities were not good during the initial days and students were taught under the trees. The construction of school was done in 1986. The construction of school was funded by Government of India. The School and nursery were especially for Tibetan refugees to get modern education. So far, total of 3000 have graduated from the school and nursery. The school has classes from 1to 4 with one office and three classrooms. Thereafter, the student move to town for further studies from class fifth. Today, the nursery remains open but, the school was closed due to a smaller number of joiners in admission. But , in the past, the school has provided educational facilities to many Tibetan refugees so they can get further education. \n2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Community hall\nThe community hall was provided for both the camps to perform certain activities such as meeting, functions, occasions, and other social gatherings related to the camp. Since both the camps share common social and culture background with similar social status, all the activities and social gatherings are done together in one community hall. The hall gives access to general meetings or official meetings done by Indian Government and CTA. Thus, the community hall provides facilities to the residents to conduct religious and cultural celebrations such as celebrating His Holiness Dalai Lama birthday, Tibetan New Year, and other important occasions. therefore, community hall facility plays an important role in livelihood of Tibetan refugees to preserve their culture and religion.\nClimate and Cultivation.\nThe average climate of Chowkur is Tropical Wet and Dry, which is favorable for its residents. Tibetans were used to the cold weather as the place is surrounded by forest. There are trees surrounded by the place which gives cooling weather throughout the year except for summer. The climate remains suitable from July to February but, the summer from March to June becomes too hot for the residents. During monsoon season, people cultivate Maize and Ginger depending on natural rain or irrigation. Though nearby Indian village grows Tobacco Tibetans chose to grow maize and sell it to CTA Government. The cultivation facilities such as loan, tractor and others are provided by CTA of Bylakuppe branch. On an average, few people do cultivation and rest of them are dependent on other source of income. The irrigation facilities are also provided by the CTA office.\nSource of Income.\nEven though Tibetans do cultivation in Chowkur but, the main source of Income of the residents are Sweater business. It is common to know that majority of Tibetans in India do Sweater business for their living. Tibetan refugees do sweater business in different parts of India for six months, during the month of August to February. The business is carried out legally, following the rules and regulation of the nation[1]. Tibetans in Chowkur also consider sweater business as main source of Income for their livelihood. The members leave from the settlement in the month of August till February to earn for their family. The readymade sweaters are bought from Ludhiana, Punjab and are sold in different parts of India such as Kurnool, Nagpur, Tata Nagar, Ahmedabad etc.\nChowkur is a quiet place to live and surrounded by nature\u2019s beauty with small pound. Chowkurians travel to other towns to buy groceries or other shopping as the settlement does not have any shop to purchase things. At the back the east side of Chowkur, there is forest area which covers other Indian villages too."}

It became one of the most popular comedic film in Japan with the box office earned around \u00a5350 million ($3,343,567.50 in US dollar).\nThe Crazy Cats comic jazz band and their featured singer Hitoshi Ueki did not invent the local genre of the \"salaryman\" comedy but they were its ubiquitous face in the 1960s. Some of the first big stars of the new medium of television, they brought standing-room-only audiences to a cinema in decline. This film established Ueki's comic persona as a salaryman who would goof off at work and yet somehow always come out ahead, every so often bursting into one of his well-known Japanese folk-inflected songs while dancing something like the twist. The first in a series of \"Irresponsible\" films whose comic songs formed the soundtrack of Japan's high economic growth.\nOverview.\nThis movie was shot in and cinemascope (TohoScope). The musical themes are \"Irresponsible Ichidai Otoko\" and \"Hello, Until Then\". This was the first memorable movie of Crazy Movie series. The Crazy Cats, which became popular on \"Shabontama Holiday\" (Nippon TV) at that time, especially Hitoshi Ueki's big hit apperence on \"Sudara Bushi\". The series that involved were three main actresses (Sonomi Nakajima, Noriko Shigeyama, Reiko Dan), but it became unexpectedly popular, and 30 more were produced up to \"Nippon ichi no shokku otoko\" (directed by Takashi Tsuboshima) in 1971. In this play, Yasuo Tanami, who was an employee of the Toho Literature Club at the time, he was originally involved in planning the President's Series, wrote the draft of the \"Irresponsible Employee\" as the antithesis of a loyal member of the company.\nThey sold it as a project for a movie starring Frankie Sakai, but the idea was scrapped due to poorly script writing, and when he left it as it was, producer Eizabur\u014d Adachi asked Tanami to make a movie named after the success of Crazy Cats's music hit \"Sudara Bushi\", and he began to wrote the screenplay. When it was released, it was agreed, and it was a scenario where Crazy Cats members were assigned to act in the film.\nPlot.\nThe average Kuchihaccho and Tehaccho (Taira Hitoshi) heard the story of Pacific sake riding in the bar \"Madrid\". Hitoshi's first job, when he mentioned the name of a senior in his hometown to the president of Pacific Sake and worked in the general affairs department, was to acquire the president of Toyama Shoji, a major shareholder.\nSuccess with a single check. Shimbashi geisha Manmaru is also a cholera with his great ability, and promotion to chief of staff is a completely easy business. However, as Mika Tenka was often said, Hitoshi was immediately fired when he learned that the kidnapper, Yuto Kuroda, had acquired Toyama's property. Kuroda's brain is Ryosuke Oshima, president of Sankai Foods, but his daughter Yoko ran away with her boyfriend Takasaku Ujiie. By the way, Hitoshi met Kuroda at the new president's inauguration party, but he returned with the outside director due to the skill of the show and the banquet. It is an unfortunate story for employees on the Taihei side that the traditional Pacific sake will become a subsidiary of Sankai Foods.\nOn the other hand, Kyoko, a geisha, and Aiko, a liquor secretary from the Pacific, ran to Tonton's boarding house and began to guess love. Hitoshi is fluttering with Aiko's fierce kiss. Around this time, Kuroda, who visited the Oshima Residence, cut the story of his daughter Yoko's marriage and discovered that he had a favorite partner, Takasaku Ujiie. Hitoshi's next job is to buy hops from Hokkai Bussan, a Pacific liquor business.\nHitoshi captured the president of the North Sea, Ishikari, who could not eat even if it was boiled or baked, with a pink film and a naked tatami in the room. However, Hitoshi, who simply doesn't wake up when he falls, discovers that Oshima and Kuroda are injured by Yoko's marriage and urges Ujiie's president to return to work, using Yoko's whereabouts as a seed. Who knows that Hitoshi, who appeared in a black tie at the Ujiie and Oshima families' wedding ceremony that day, is the new president of Hokkai Bussan!\nTheme songs / Insert songs.\nSkinny Manbushi (\u3084\u305b\u304c\u307e\u3093\u7bc0, \"Yase gaman-bushi\")\nAn original movie song played when Hitoshi goes to the Ujiie family at night. Later sung in \"Sudara Gaiden\". In the trailer, it was \"Skinny Manbushi\", but in the OP credit, it was written as \"Skinny Patience Bushi\".\nDon't Clause (\u30c9\u30f3\u30c8\u7bc0, \"Donto-bushi\")\nHitoshi, who went to the Ujiie family, robs Takasaku of his guitar and sings.\nSudara Section (\u30b9\u30fc\u30c0\u30e9\u7bc0, \"S\u016bdara-bushi\")\nUse number 2. After returning to the boarding house, Hitoshi throws out the betting ticket while climbing the stairs and sings while cleaning his suit.\nFifty Thousand Verses (\u4e94\u4e07\u7bc0, \"50, 000-Setsu\")\nHitoshi, who saw a pair of Takasaku and Yoko at the bar, muttered, \"Well, when I was a student,\" and first sang one phrase with a cappella, followed by a shout of \"Ah, that!\" With BGM, and was a guest at the same bar. Sing with Otsuka, Sakura, Aoki and Yasui. All lyrics are movie original.\nHello, Until Then (\u30cf\u30a4\u305d\u308c\u307e\u3067\u30e7, \"Haisoremade~yo\")\nHitoshi sings at the inaugural meeting of President Kuroda, and Otsuka, Sakura, Aoki, and Yasui act as back dancers.

The remnant of the Bakufu Army set up a defense around and used variety of weapons (katanas, , and ) against Japanese forces who are marching to the two-pronged entrance leading to Hakodate, and blocked the advance of the new government army for two weeks. \nBackground.\nOn April 9, 1869, 1,500 Japanese troops landed in and began marching toward Hakodate from three routes. One of them, Futamata, was the shortest route to Hakodate, and was the only place that crossed the pass from Inakuraishi between Futamata to Onomura.

The former Shogunate Army, which will be greeted by a Vice-Commander, will lead 300 samurais consisting of two platoons of the Shinsengumi and two regiments of the Ezo training infantry (\u885d\u92d2\u968a The Impulse Corps), and will arrive in two days on April 10 and set up the headquarters in Daibayama. \nThe Bakufu Army set up 16 around Daibayama with Tenguyama as an references point, and waited for the enemy. \nBattle.\nAt 3:00 pm on April 13, the Japanese army started marching from to the captured Tenguyama position and launched an attack on Odaiba. The former Shogunate Army defended Odaiba with rifles and by using the battlement as a shield, and a fierce shooting battle occurred. The Japanese army, which is superior in number, changed soldiers one after another and repeated attacks, and the Bakufu rebels, which greeted them, continued to attack them while taking breaks with two platoons taking turns. When it started to rain around sunset, the former Shogunate army put on a jacket to protect the ammunition from getting wet, and when the bullets got wet, they were put in pockets and dried. \nThe next day, around 7 am on the 14th, the Imperialist army were exhausted and withdrew to Inakuraishi. In a 16-hour battle, the Bakufu forces consumed 35,000 bullets. On the day the battle was over, Hijikata Toshizo was heading to Goryokaku for a report and a request for reinforcements. \nOn April 16, when 2,400 newly Japanese troops landed in Esashi, the reinforcements consisting of and soldiers were dispatched to the area, and their ammunition and food were also supplied.

It was a strategy to send soldiers and ammunition from here to attack the fort from behind the Shogunate forces, but this plan was also extremely difficult. During this time, two platoons of trainee officers led by Mitsutaro Takigawa have been strengthened in the former Shogunate army. On April 23, the battle began as the former Shogunate army's repulsion approached the Tenguyama position of the Imperial Japanese army guarded by the troops of the .\nAround 4 pm on the same day, the Japanese army, which abandoned the battlement, climbed a steep cliff and fired at the enemy from the mountain with their rifles on the left side of the defenders, and it was a fierce night battle.

The Japanese army was confused, and Masagor\u014d Komai, who tried to stop his own route by himself, was killed after being hit by a bullet in the chest. Even so, the new government forces replaced new soldiers one after another, but they did not defeat the old Shogunate forces and finally retreated before dawn on the 25th.\nIn this battle, which lasted more than a day and night, the former Shogunate army continued to attack the Imperialist while cooling the hot barrel rifles with tub water. After that, the Japanese army will give up the capture of Daibayama and concentrate on a detour building.

This is said to be in balance with other members of Crazy Cats (Shin Yasuda was born in 1932). As a result, Yasuda is younger than \u00catar\u00f4 Ishibashi and Hiroshi Inuzuka, who are third-year students from the old high school. Born in London, England where his father was assigned as his previous name, Henry Sakurai, he grew up there until he was three years old. Senri is a or overseas children.

After attending the Gyosei Junior and Senior High School, Sakurai entered the Faculty of Political Economy at the Waseda University.\nWhen Sakurai was in his sophomore year of college, a group called the \"Sun Valley Swing Band\" asked him to be a pinch hitter, and after that, he officially joined and started working as a jazz pianist. After leaving college, he moved into various bands. In 1952, Toshiko Akiyoshi went to the United States and participated in the Gay Stars, where the pianist was absent, and Sakurai take over the group for her. After that, he formed a trio with Yasumitsu Suzuki and Akira Fukuhara, but at the invitation of Frankie Sakai, he joined the jazz band \"Frankie Sakai and City Slickers\". At this time, he met Kei Tani, who was a member at the time, as well as Hitoshi Ueki. After leaving the City Slickers a year later, he joined Toriro Miki's Joke Studio and taught singing and composition.\nHis stage name at that time was Hinaro Miki (\u4e09\u6728\u96db\u90ce, \"Miki Hinaro\"). Tonpei Hidari and Eileen Fagen are the song's disciples at the time. He joined the jazz band \"Hajime Hana and Crazy Cats\" in 1960 as pianist. He will take over \u00catar\u00f4 Ishibashi's place, who was being treated for tuberculosis. After returning to Ishibashi, Hitoshi Ueki and the others opined that they should leave, but Hajime Hana, the leader, persuaded the other members to officially join the group, saying, \"Because I became friends.\" In 1971, when Ishibashi left, Crazy Cats took the anomalous form of two pianists and began to perform controls that made use of the \"continuous bullets\" style (after that, Ishibashi often guest-starred on crazy The Bullet Series is standard). Ishibashi is said to be bold and Sakurai is said to be delicate.\nOn the variety show Shabontama Holiday, the action with the great Hiroshi Inuzuka is famous. He has a history of songwriting activities and composed funky three singles like \"Nakanaka Not Found\", Mieko Hirota's single \"Looking at Tomorrow\" (both songs are written by Yukio Aoshima) under the real name Chisato Sakurai. He is also active as an actor and has appeared in many movies and television shows such as \"\"The Lovable Tramp\" (Shochiku) and \"Kureji ogon sakusen\"\" (Toho).

The character \"Auntie Senri\" who appeared in the Dainihon Jochugiku Company commercial is also famous. The word \"Ruchonki\" Sakurai said in this commercial became a buzzword at the time. During his life, Sakurai had a deep knowledge of classical music and opera, and often wrote manuscripts for trade magazines.\nHe also said that he had a daily routine to go to the piano for an hour to remember the feeling of playing. In 2006, he appeared in the movie \"Notebook of Life\" (directed by Makoto Itakura) as an employee of a consignment station at the Kotsunagi Station of Iwate Galaxy Railway Line.\nOn April 27, 2007, he served as chairman of the funeral ceremony along with Tani and Inuzuka at the \"Farewell Party\" for Ueki.

His mother Chiyo was born as the fifth of eight siblings to the wealthy Ishibashi family. When Etaro was three years old, his father raped actress Hiroko Kawasaki at a place where he went to wrote a film score. Rando takes responsibility and remarries Kawasaki after separating from Etaro's mother. \nFor this reason, Etaro returned to the home of his grandparents home with his mother and became Ishibashi's surname. Since her mother was discriminated against for her parents' home when she returned with her children, women would bullied her for being called a \"living girl\" every time, but on the other hand, it was a complicated environment where she was adored by cats who did not pay attention to money. The Ishibashi Family at the time was holding up a sign from the Nito store, which runs the transportation business with 400 to 500 workers at (which is the government-owned railway), and it said, \"I think the economy was good.\"\nThere weren't many Leonard Bernstein special records in Japan, and there were even airplanes, \"says Etaro (although Bernstein is not made in Germany, but a Japanese Tenryu instrument, which is a manufacturing brand). His maternal older brother, Katsunami Ishibashi, is a pilot in the and an aviator who flew under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris during the World War I victory parade. After attending at the Bunkai Jinjo Elementary School in , Ishibashi was transferred to the Hyosung Elementary School in 1939. \nWhile at the Hyosung High School, he meet Senri Sakurai, who was a senior and Hiroshi Inuzuka, a third-year student. In 1944, due to the , he moved to the J\u014dshinji Temple in with his mother and his maternal grandfather. That same year, he learned for the first time that his father, who had been told he had died, survived from natural causes.\nIn 1945, Ishibashi entered the School of Oriental Music (now Tokyo College of Music). After studying classical piano at the piano department, he switched to the vocal music department ( was in the third quarter at this time). Around that time, Ishibashi left his mother and visited his father in . At that time, he received a lot of hospitality from his father, but soon after, his mother filed a lawsuit in the Odawara court against her husband on behalf of the city, and the government had began to considered Kando as criminal to the state. Ishibashi would later graduated from the School of Oriental Music in 1949. At that time, it was difficult to earn a living in the world of classical music, so he lived playing in a club in and teaching piano to the neighborhood children. \nIn 1947, Ishibashi appeared as a member of the choir in Miho Nagato Opera Company's first performance, \"Madame Butterfly.\" Finally, a pianist of the band \"Honey Jokers\" dedicated to the expeditionary force club collapsed due to acute pneumonia, so he was overwhelmed by the manager and participated in the audition to fill the vacancy and made his debut as a jazz man. Until then, Ishibashi began to liked classical music and hated jazz, but the mighty meals of the expeditionary force club caught up with him and he turned to jazz lovers.\nUnder the stage name George Ishibashi, he was a made member of the stationed during the Korean War to performed in front of US and soldiers. \nThere was a time when people around me recommended that Ishibashi traveled to the United States to practice jazz, but at the time, the he didn't have enough money to buy these expensive records, so he kept the his bank account from the U.S. Army NCO in the money fundraising group. The noncommissioned officer, who had crashed and died, the grieving family kept score, and the plan to travel to the United States sometimes canceled. Around this time, he suffered from and performed while battling the disease. Eventually he formed his own band \"The Five\". After working on \" and the New Sounds Trio\", Ishibashi joined \"Hajime Hana and The Crazy Cats\" as a pianist in March 1956.\nAt first, Ishibashi thought he should play, but from day one a basin was thrown at him and he had a , so he often thought about committing suicide. In June 1960, he temporarily left his artistic endeavors due to surgery to reshape his six ribs due to tuberculosis, but returned in August 1961 and has since played piano with Senri Sakurai, who has joined the members as his understudy. On December 31, 1970, he left Crazy Cats due to heart disease. \nDuring an interview with the Asahi Shimbun news article, he said \"If I quit smoking and went back to work in entertainment, they would tell me that I would not be satisfied with something.\" Ishibashi didn't like how he was retired from the entertainment world. At that same year, Ishibashi has been active as a culinary researcher and since 1967, he has run a \"Sangyo-dong\" sake and side dish shop in , Shibuya, Tokyo (he took over the shop originally run by his father, Rando). \nIn 1988, all the Crazy Cats member appeared in the movie \"Company Story\", which was produced a long time ago. While the other sic people included a lot of co-star scenes, it showed a memory scene as a colleague who had already died, a few seconds and only two cuts, and was a retired person. Although it can be mistakenly described as the appearance of a bank movie, he looks like an older person and wears the same company emblem as the main characters around his neck.\nIn 1994, Ishibashi died at the Showa University Hospital in Shinagawa, Tokyo due to heart failure caused by stomach cancer. He was 66 years old. Known as a drinker, he has even placed a bet and drank a bottle of sake. Also, \"Sangyo-dong\" was run by a widow, but it will be closed once at the end of October 2018 due to the redevelopment of the surrounding area. It was reopened near the old store in May 2019."}

According to the 2015 Census, there were 1,972 people living there. This accounted for 6.47 percent of Mallig's overall population.\nHistory.\nAfter liberation in the second world war, people from different areas such as Pangasinan, Ilocos, Nueva Ecija, Indonesia, and many more people from different regions came to this place and lived in lands that do not yet have land titles because there are not enough citizens, and this area is not yet a barangay. The municipality of Mallig just let it go.\nThe elders who preceded this area, they were Pedro Ignacio, Alejo Orzame, Elias Seguancia, Alejandro Balmores, Gonzalo Mabuti, the former mayors were Eduardo Siababa, Cornelio Corpuz, Geminiano Soria, Alipo Castro, Gregorio Barbo, Eugenio Solanzo, Leoncio Pico, Cerilo Ladiero, Alipio Senica, Alejandro Gabatino, Genaro Seguancia, Carlos Catacutan, Juan Calderon, Ramon Domingo, Bernabe Cabanting and many more.\nIt took a few years before the elders had a meeting in this area to make it a Barrio or Barangay, and they did it successfully. Gemeniano Soria was the first one they recommended to be the Teniente del Baryo or Barangay Captain. They named this barangay \"Siempre Viva\" from the Spanish language \"Always Alive\" after they won the \"Salip\" in the town of Mallig in Rigodon, a dance and many more contests that they won.\nMany children find it challenging to study because there is no school and no proper physical school. Once granted, Mayor Eduardo Siababa met the elders to go to the mountain to get materials for the \"Eskuelahan\" or School. A few years passed, and they also finished school, but a powerful storm destroyed it. It was so bad that the children could not use it to study there.\nIn 1948, some researchers and surveyors came to make Siempre Viva a town or city, but it did not proceed because it was far from the National Highway.\nFrom 1950 - 1953, many were afraid to live in Siempre Viva because of the brutality of the Kalingas. All the people living in Siempre Viva sleep under their houses when the night comes. Mayor Eduardo R. Siababa decided to approach the \"Panglakayen\" (Leader) of the Kalingas to have an organization that would maintain peace and cooperation between the Ilocanos and Kalingas. The organization was well established and was called \"Boddong\".\nSeveral decades passed, and the residents believed it would be better to divide the 60 hectares of land into two independent barangay to receive more projects and funds from the Government. In 1984, the two barrios were separated, and in the South, Siempre Viva Sur was located, while in the North, Siempre Viva Norte was located.\nEducation.\nSiempre Viva Norte is home to one of the oldest elementary school in Mallig, Siempre Viva Norte Elementary School established in 1949.\nThe following educational institutions are also located within the village:\nDemographics.\nPopulation by age group.\nThe age group with the highest population in Siempre Viva Norte, according to the 2015 Census, is 20 to 24, with 194 individuals.

Finally, the old dependent population, which includes senior citizens aged 65 and up, accounts for 4.46 percent (88) of the total.\nAccording to the calculated Age Dependency Ratios, there are 42 youth dependents for every 100 working-age people in Siempre Viva Norte; 7 aged/senior citizens for every 100 working-age people in Siempre Viva Norte; and 48 dependents (young and old-age) for every 100 working-age people in Siempre Viva Norte.

It is said that it was influenced by rock groups such as The Ventures, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones in Europe and the United States, and it became popular in Japan from 1960 to 1971. \nHistory.\nGenerally speaking, \"Group Sounds\" refers to rock groups that were active mainly in jazz and go-go cafes in the late 1960s. This genre has some common because many groups have organized lead vocals, electric guitars, electric bass, &amp; drums.\nExceptionally, there was a group of vocalists such as the early The Happenings Four, a guitarless GS, and the early Sharp Hawks, a chorus GS with a professional electric band in the background. In May 1965, while the popularity of British rock bands such as The Beatles spread to Japan, Sh\u014dchi Tanabe and The Spiders released \"Furi Furi\", which is considered to be the first Group Sounds record. In March 1966, Jackey Yoshikawa &amp; His Blue Comets announced their first album \"Blue Eyes\".\nThis year after the Beatles' performance in Japan in June 30, the groups began to sing while playing musical instruments such as electric guitars will debut one after another in Japan. In response to this, the youth entertainment magazine \"Weekly Meisei\", began to collectively call these groups and music \"Group Sounds\" or \"GS\", and the name became widespread. There are several theories. There is a theory that Takeshi Terauchi said that in 1965 when asked about the genre of Blue Jeans at that time, \"It's a group sound\" and \"But it's a singular form, so Group Sounds is better\".\nBlue Jeans were influenced by The Ventures. Those who were active as professional bands before the Beatles' performance in Japan, such as Blue Jeans, Blue Comets and The Spiders, and those who played blues rock like The Golden Cups and The Tempters, The are some bands title from amateurs, such as The Tigers and The Jaguars, were formed by students who were influenced by \"The Beatles\" and \"Rolling Stones\". In this way, even with GS, the musicality of each group varied considerably. The music industry at that time was still old, and entertainment professionals and record companies wanted to ask professional composers and lyricists to write music for GS upcoming songs.\nTherefore, the Tempters and The Golden Cups, who played mainly their favorite Western rock music at concerts and recitals, felt a backlash. Some groups, like The Golden Cups, adhered to the policy of never playing singles like \"Long-Haired Girl\" at live performances. Jackey Yoshikawa &amp; His Blue Comets and The Spiders became popular groups in the early days of the GS boom, and The Tigers, The Tempters, and Ox became popular in the middle and late stages of the GS boom.\nHowever, The Spiders, The Blue Comets, and The Golden Cups were also popular GS comparable to them. Since the 2000s, PYG, which debuted in 1971, has been re-evaluated. At the time of the 1960s, Japan was a society with a feudal side with strong fatherhood, and elements such as long hair and electric guitar were linked to badness and juvenile delinquency, and the wind from the general public was very strong. As a result, some high school students who went to see Group Sounds concerts were either suspended or dropped out to created their own band. In addition, junior high schools and high schools that prohibited going to concerts appeared one after another. At an outdoor concert at The Tigers' Nara Ayame Pond in November 1967, a fan fell and was seriously injured. Therefore, NHK cut the appearance part of The Tigers that had already been recorded in \"Grand Show of Song\", and after that, with the exception of Jackey Yoshikawa and his Blue Comets who had short hair, long-haired group sounds come and was banned due to poor rating.\nIn May 1968, a concert admission ticket forgery by a high school girl fan of The Tigers also occurred. A series of girls who actually fainted due to the fainting performance that Ox performed on the stage, and this triggered the antipathy of PTA and educators. And to prevent accidents, theaters and local governments appeared that Group Sounds bands did not provide concert venues.In the special feature of \"Record Collectors\", record companies who want to appoint professional songwriters to the GS group who aimed to make their own performances by hiring songwriters such as Rei Nakanishi, Kunihiko Murai, Ky\u014dhei Tsutsumi, Kunihiko Suzuki and other songwriters. Since they hired as composer, they couldn't do it even if the writers wanted to cover Western music rock.\nIn the 1960s, there were several professional female GSs (belonging to the office), including Pinky Chicks, Chikako Matsuda, and Tokyo Pink Pearls. Only Pinky Chicks has released a record. Some female GS members were able to release disco records in the 70's. Later, a surf rock-style Golden Half also debuted their records. Their album, \"Beyond the Sun\", was a cover of Astro Notes. Emy Jackson was a solo singer who made her debut on Philips Records as an English=born citizen, but during the heyday of GS, Akiko Nakamura, Jun Mayuzumi, Michi Aoyama, Rumi Koyama, Aki Izumi and others also made their debut. Akiko Nakamura's \"Nijiiro no Lake\", Jun Mayuzumi's \"Tenshi no Yuwaku\" and \"Koi no Hallelujah\" were big hits in the music rating.\nJun Mayuzumi's \"Saturday Night, something happens\" is a representative song of the female version of GS. In addition to the hit song, Ichiro Araki, a male singer and songwriter, released an ambitious work, \"I'm in Rockland with you.\" It was the cult GS that came to the forefront in the 1990s, about 20 years after the GS was over. The Genova's \"Saharin's Light Doesn't Extinguish\" and The Voltage's \"It's a Man's Man's World\" are examples of cult GS works.\nThe GS boom peaked around the summer of 1968, and more than 100 groups made their record debuts, but in the spring of 1969, major members withdrew from popular groups such as The Tigers, The Carnabeats, and OX, and again. Jackey Yoshikawa and his Blue Comets even recorded songs on a mood song line. Around 1970, the GS boom came to an end, and in 1971, most groups were disbanded or disappeared spontaneously. After that, among the people who served as lead vocals in the popular Group Sounds, there are many people who continue to be active on the entertainment such as solo singers, musicians, actors, and talents even after the group disbanded. In addition, there are some people who have served as other musical instrument parts, such as actors, composers, studio musicians, music producers, and entertainment agency managers, who are among the important figures in the entertainment world.\nFrom 1988 to 1990, a group called the Tigers Memorial Club Band was formed, and the hit songs of that time were released one after another. In addition, Kyosei Iwamoto, who was imitating Kenji Sawada, was impressed by them and formed a band with Katsumi Kahashi, Taro Morimoto, Shiro Kishibe and The Tigers Mania among members of The Tigers in 1993. \"Victim of Romance\" has been released. Meanwhile, The Wild Ones was reunited in 1981 and is still active to this day.\nIn addition, Jackey Yoshikawa and his Blue Comets did not dissolve (still preferred Blue Comets as GS took the form of dissolution &amp; reorganization in the fall of 1972) and continued activities while repeating member changes, and after the death of Daisuke Inoue in 2000, the heyday We are returning to the organization of the remaining four people. Both The Tigers and The Wild Ones belonged to Watanabe Productions during the heyday of GS.\nIn 2002, Village Singers' \"The Girl with Flaxen Hair\" was covered by Hitomi Shimatani and became a smash hit. GS was treated for a long time as a so-called \"old-fashioned melody\" after the boom had passed. However, research by Susumu Kurosawa, a GS researcher from the mid-1980s, and re-verification by Haruo Chikada have been carried out, and it has attracted some attention. The Mops are also evaluated overseas as \"psychedelic rock\" and \"garage rock\". In Japan, re-edited albums by label, albums by genre, and CD recurrences with the same paper jacket specifications at the time of release were released one after another. Kyohei Tsutsumi provided the songs for C-C-B, which appeared in the mid-1980s. At about the same time, a phenomenon was seen in which a younger generation of GS fans played GS-style songs mainly at live houses in Tokyo. Representative bands at that time include The Phantom Gift and The Collectors. This movement was featured in some media, but it was a small phenomenon. After that, Dixied, Emons and others inherited GS.\nEven after the 21st century, GS-style rock bands and GS followers such as Kinoko Hotel, The Captains, and The Shallows have been born. Since 2010, bands such as The Juliannes was created by former Jackey Yoshikawa and Tsunaki Mihara of Blue Comets have been created."}

They told doctors that patients would probably not become addicted, so the doctors prescribed opioids to many patients, even if they did not really need them. Many of those patients became addicted. In 2007, Purdue Pharma was fined $635 million. The judge said this was because Purdue Pharma did not warn customers about the side effects enough. Since then, there have been other similar lawsuits.\nIn 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. That same year, an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 652,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder.\n21 to 29 percent of patients given opioids use them wrong in some way. 4 to 6 percent switch from prescription opioids to the illegal drug heroin.\nWomen are affected more often.\nThe opioid crisis affects women and men differently, For instance, women are more likely than men to become addicted. Women are also more likely to suffer chronic pain than men are. There are many situations in which women are to receive pain medicine. In cases of domestic abuse and rape, women are prescribed pain medicine more than men. Along with that, during pregnancy women may use prescription opioids to help with pregnancy pain, especially with post-pregnancy pain. The number of women that have died from opioid pain relievers has increased five times from what it was in 1999 in 2010. To help stop the spread of opioid abuse in women, it is advised that women are educated on the drugs that they are taking and the possible risk of addiction. Additionally, alternatives should always be used when possible in order to prevent addiction."}

In particular, the third dispute in 1948 was a large-scale one when the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the United States Army, which were part in the occupation of Japan as a member of the Allied Forces, were dispatched to requisition the studio staffs. It is said to be the biggest labor dispute after the Pacific War. \nSummary.\nIn early 1946, American journalist for the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, David W. Conde, visits Japan and was concerned about radical groups who are planning to sabotage Japan's reconstruction policy. He was hastened about the formation of a labor union at the studio and also set up a union party on how to negotiate with the company. Back in December 1945, the Toho Employees' Union (subordinate union) was formed in Toho due to the postwar turmoil and the rise of the socialist movement. The subordinates also joined the All Japan Trade Union Conference and frequently went on strike.\nThe labor movement was booming at once, partly because the Japanese Communist Party members such as Tadashi Imai and Satsuo Yamamoto were enrolled during the war. And with a huge force of 90% of employees and 5,600 members, they began to confront the company. The first dispute began in March 1946, and the second in October of that same year. The first strike was relatively mild. But the second one allowed the company to approve various new agreements, such as restrictions on working hours, by the workers. Due to the strike and the turmoil of the new agreement, movie shooting were not easily, and Toho produced 18 films, which was half than other companies.\nIn November, Kazuo Hasegawa, Ranko Hanai and others agreed with Denjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi, who said that he would not be able to use the strike, although he was against the strike. A big star formed the \"Flag of Ten People\" and left the union. Director Kunio Watanabe also withdrew from the union, and employees in the distribution department who were in conflict over the policy formed a second union and withdrew. In March 1947, they formed Shintoho, mainly by the members of the \"Ten no Hana no Kai\" and more than a hundred volunteers who left the union at the same time. Although it was difficult for Toho to operate soundly, the management team at that time dared to leave the group as the \"first production department\" and the group leaving the group as the \"second production department\" in order to avoid a direct confrontation with the huge subordinate group.\nIn addition, new young actors such as Toshiro Mifune and Hajime Izu refused to joined the studio and left to do some cast audition. They were called the \"Toho New Face\".\nThe Third Strike.\nIn December 1947, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers issued an expulsion order to Toho, and the management team was replaced. President Katamaru Tanabe, was appointed as chairman, and the new president was invited from outside by Tetsuz\u014d Watanabe, a former managing director of the Japan's Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a member of the House of Representatives.\nWatanabe, who known as an \"anti-communist\" for some time, set up a hardliner as a director in charge of labor and a director of the studio, and on April 8, 1948, 270 employees of the Tokyo Dadeumi studio. Suddenly, the company fired him and his name was removed from the list. In addition, it announced a plan to dismiss 1,200 people to reduce personnel. \nOn April 15, the followers entered the production control struggle, occupied the Tokyo Hibiki studio, placed materials and equipment under control, and made a barricade at the front entrance to prevent the police from enter the building. This marks the beginning of the Third Strike. On the other hand, the management side declared that the company will be closed on May 1 (which would latter celebrate as May Day). The subordinate group applied to the Tokyo District Court for a provisional disposition requesting the resumption of business of the company, but the company also applied for a provisional disposition requesting the release of possession and countered it. The following day, on the 14th, a court executive headed to the Shikk\u014dkan Studio, but at this time, 800 members of the union members were denied admission.\nThe provisional disposition will be decided again on August 19, but before that, 2,500 workers stayed at the Hibiki Studio. Film directors such as Heinosuke Gosho, producers such as Akira Iwasaki and Taker\u00f4 It\u00f4, screenwriters like Y\u016bsaku Yamagata, cinematographers like Yoshio Miyajima, and actresses like Setsuko Wakayama, Yoshiko Kuga, and Chieko Nakakita also participated. In front of the studio of each set, multiple large barrels filled with non-combustible paint were lined up, and a large fan for special effects equipped with a Zero fighter plane engine was brought out and installed on each barrel. When the police rushed in, the wind pressure used to blow gravel, glass fragments, and paint, which was actually used it. There was also a mechanism to drop a bag filled with pieces of wood and glass balls from the roof and windows.\nA current-carrying trap was also set up. In the morning of the same day, Major General William C. Chase, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division of the U.S. Army, stationed at Camp Drake, a part of the Allied Forces that was engaged in Japan's occupation, sending 150 GI soldiers, armed with M1 carbines and 1 infantry vehicle unit. He led a platoon of six armored vehicles, three M4 medium tanks, and three aircraft to seized Camp Asaka. These units were US ground forces under the command of Lieutenant Henry F.T. Hoffman while Chase took command from the Air Force. At 8:30 AM on the same day, 2,000 troopers of the Metropolitan Police Reserve began to surrounded Dadeumi to assist in the execution of provisional disposition.\nGetting on and off at the Seijogakuenmae Station and since the Odakyu Line was prohibited, the road leading to the Hibiki Photo Studio was blocked by protesters. At 9:30 AM, the chief of the Seijo police station (along with executive officer and the lawyer of the company's agency) boarded the US military truck and drove out of the station while being protected by a dozen police officers. Requested the acceptance of provisional disposition by the executive officer, they negotiated with the representative of the subordinate group. Around 10:30 AM, police reserve unit began to deploy at the front main gate of the Hibiki studio, followed by tanks. Film director Fumio Kamei put up a piece of paper to the reserve team in front of the main gate of the Tsuki Photo Studio, it read \"Justice cannot be trampled by violence.\"\nAfter that, the subordinates decided that it was impossible to resist by force because they were surrounded by the army, and held a staff meeting to accept provisional disposition. At 11:00 AM, 2,500 union members crossed their arms, sang \"The Internationale\" songs, left the studio, and withdrew to the Theater Institute. Subsequently, an executive officer entered the office and posted a notice of provisional disposition execution. At this time, the Toho Branch of the Nikkei Performance occupied the Toho Sales Department (cinema) in addition to the Toho Photo Studio. Businessman Tetsuzo Watanabe sought to break down the dispute from a commercial perspective, as the closure of the movie theater would directly affect the company's management.\nKunio Watanabe, the filmmaker of Toho, was sent to Toichi Mannen, the leader of the Foolish League, to ask him to strike a movie theater in Hibiya. Every day, Mannen attacked the movie theater with 50 to 100 subordinates, including \"Komitsu\" Mitsuya Kobayashi and \"Shinjuku Emperor\" Kano Mitsugu, and expelled the union members. He also demanded Toho for daily struggle costs, but did not receive a success fee. On October 18, Takero Ito and Yoshio Miyajima, the top executives of the union, met with President Watanabe and others. At this point, an agreement was reached to withdraw the dismissal of the remaining 250 union executives, in exchange for the voluntary departure of 20 union executives.\nIn addition, a large-scale freeze on personnel reduction was recognized, and the Third Toho Dispute was finally officially settled by the signing of a memorandum of understanding by the union and the company. In 1950, Toho dismissed 200 people whose dismissal was withdrawn due to Toho Dispute in the form of a red purge.\nAllied Forces Dispatch.\nSince the February 1 General Strike, which was planned in 1947, was a large-scale labor dispute between government agencies, there was a tentative reason that GHQ / SCAP would be \"contrary to the welfare of the people\" in order to intervene. In addition, the cancellation method was a brute force but \"peaceful\" solution, in which the leader was made to broadcast the cancellation. However, despite the fact that this case was a labor dispute by a company, when he saw that he refused the provisional disposition of the court, he carried out a rough business of disbanding the labor movement by force.\nAt the time of the February strike, Commander-in-Chief Douglas MacArthur was very concerned about the eyes of the American people, as he intended to run for the presidential election the following year from the Republican Party. The Republican Party had a large support base for the labor union, and did not want to crack down on the Japanese labor movement and damage its reputation, so it did not move directly until the strike happen. Moreover, dispatching the army was nothing more than a matter of fact (except in the days of McCarthyism and the Red Scare, the Communist Party is legal in the United States, and the Communist Party of America exists as a political party. General MacArthur once put down the (alleging that they were being manipulated by the Communist Party) while serving in the National Guards.\nHowever, MacArthur was defeated in the 1948 United States presidential election and was not elected as a candidate. From this time on, MacArthur did not have to worry about the eyes of the American people, and the Toho Dispute was forcibly died down at that time. In August 1948, the Soviet Union began setting up its forces around the Eastern Bloc due to the Berlin Airlift that ended Stalin's blockade policy and the United States, which cannot tolerate this communist activities by Russians, began setting up relationship with Japan in order to prevent this spread of communism.

It lasted from May 17, 1950 to December 29, 1950, although it is not widely known because of its small number. Even after the end of the third strike in 1948, Toho continued to increase its popularity due to incongruity with internal factions and Shintoho, and its debt and other debts at the end of January 1950 were about \u00a51.3 billion. It amounted to \u00a5150 million and there was an urgent need for new personnel reductions.\nOn May 17, 1950, the company announced a notice of personnel reduction for 300 people. The target of the arrangement was mainly the Japan's Motion Picture and Theatrical Worker's Union (JMTW), but in addition to that, the members of the National Film Theater Labor Union (All Screening Performance), which was born by splitting from the Nikkei Performance, are also targeted.

On the other hand, Nikkei, which has led the dispute, applied to the Tokyo District Court for provisional disposition of dismissal invalid status protection on June 25, and on August 10, a recommendation was issued by the Tokyo District Court and the memorandum of understanding was made at the Tokyo District Court on May 28. On December 29, a tentative signing was made at the Japanese company, ending the dispute. Kinuta Productions, which produced the feature film \"Haha Nareba Onna\", directed by Fumio Kamei and starring Isuzu Yamada in 1952, was paid to Nikkei for the settlement of the 4th Toho Dispute. Of course it is said that it was established with a capital of \u00a52 million."}

It is also common that force is used to make the boy do things he doesn't want to do.

Older boys, which may start growing a beard, may appear ugly. If men have sexual relationships with bachis, they are not seen as homosexuals. Commonly the father will recommend his boy to a group of male friends. The other option is that the father agrees to give his son to a male suitor. This way, the father actis like a pimp.

Their strong performance such as holding a one-man show continued, and their single \"Um Um Um\" was released in August. \nHowever, the GS boom peaked in 1968 and began to died down with upcoming rhythm and blues, hard and soft rocks, funky, and disco during the early 1970s. The next single \"My Baby\" was released in October, and even with Takano's singing reminiscent of the early singles, it did not become a hit. On March 1969, the Beatles' \"\", which is famous for its marmalade rhythm, was released with the translation of Kenji Sazanami for the first time. However, in April, vocalist Usui left the group, and Paul Okada, who was in another GS, joined them.

It was launched into orbit in April 1971 by the Soviet Union and stayed in space until October 1971. During its time in space, it was visited by two spacecraft with crews. The purpose of Salyut 1 was to learn and test how a space station worked. A second goal was to find out how being in space a long time effected the human body. It had a number of problems but a lot was learned from it that helped with future stations. \nThe station was at first part of the Almaz program, to make a secret military station in space. On 16 February 1970 it was decided to make it civilian instead. The Soviet space program gave the name DOS to the program. That is an abbreviation of the Russian \"Dolgovremennaya Orbitalnaya Stanziya\" which in English means \"Long Term Orbital Station\". The first station was called DOS-1 by the people working on space program. To the public, it was to be known as Zarya but was changed to Salyut before launch. Salyut is the Russian word for salute and was given to honor Yuri Gagarin.\nThe station was shaped like a cylinder and had four areas. One was a docking module to allow a spacecraft to connect. The second was the main module where people could live. The third was the auxiliary module that had the equipment to run the station. The fourth had the engines to move the station. Besides these, the station had four solar panels.\nThe launch was on 19 April 1971 on a Proton K rocket. Two days later the first crew was also launched on a Soyuz rocket. They were supposed to stay for 30 days at the station. This did not happen as there was a problem in docking (connecting) their spacecraft to the station. After trying for 5.5 hours, they had to return to Earth. A second crew (Soyuz 11) was sent on 6 June 1971 and was able to enter. At first the mission went well. But due to problems on the station they could only stay 23 days of the planned 30. Their stay was the longest any people had spent in space at that time. While at the station they did experiments to help scientists understand life in space. The crew of Soyuz 11 died during re-entry of the atmosphere when their air escaped. No other spacecraft visited the station. Salyut 1 was de-orbited (removed from space) on 11 October 1971. The engines were used to lower the orbit so it would burn up in the atmosphere. \nThe design of Soyuz 1 proved to be a good one. Later long-term stations such as Salyut 7 and Salyut 8 were based on it. And parts of Mir and the Zvezda module of the International Space Station were also based on this design.\nSoyuz 1 was followed by the Salyut 2 station, which failed."}

Its cultural and traditional beauty makes it unique in every other way. The most renowned places of the city are Madan Mahal, Bhedaghat, Dhuadhar Waterfalls, Marble Rocks and much more. Jabalpur is a 2 tier city that is under the process of development apart from the constant developing process it also comes under the purview of the Jabalpur Smart City project. The constant planning and construction of which has done wonders and has largely affected many significant growing projects. Vijay Nagar can't be fully termed as a part but, it has deeply influenced. Although, there are few lesser-known beauties of this city that makes it one of a kind and they are situated within the residential area of Jabalpur. One such popular residential area is Vijay Nagar which has become influential in recent years. \nDeen Dayal Bus Terminal.\nPreviously, the area of Vijay Nagar was a dense jungle with permanent houses a distance away with no major medical or schooling facility available. The main credit for development has to be given to the National Bus Terminal popularly known as Deen Dayal Bus Terminal which is being built nearby resulting in the crowd of expensive cafes and hang-out points. The Chief Minister Mr Shivraj Singh Chauhan under his power has taken full responsibility for this project which was completed in 2016. The terminal is built on a lake called Madhotal and Jabalpur was once known as the city of lakes which is also taal in Hindi, due to many lakes present in various areas but now it is widely known as the Marble City. It is said that this terminal consists of a beautiful garden, spreading it to a large area. \nKachnar City.\nVijay Nagar is often known after the name of Kachnar City being the biggest residential area and a major tourist spot. As the city is known for its cultural diversity, the Corporation built a solitary temple for Lord Shiva with pure white marble which is the speciality of this place. This Lord Shiva Temple eventually became famous for tourist attraction and added to the beauty of Jabalpur. The lord shiva statue is around 76 feet tall and has integrated design work which makes it extremely famous. Kachnar City Temple is termed as one of the most popular and widely held religious sites in the entire state of Madhya Pradesh for its detailing and beauty. There is a secret chamber that has around 12 shiva lingams from all the major Shiva temples in the country which are also popularly known as Jyotirlinga according to Hindu Mythology. \nLater, with further construction and proper planning, Vijay Nagar is known for two things - Shalby Hospital as the best and largest multi-specialist hospital &amp; Kachnar City Mahadev as the oldest &amp; in fact the first skilled beauty establishment in the city which is situated in the middle and much appreciated by the residents. Previously the idol was in white colour but now it has been changed to blue. Due to a unique blend of luscious green surroundings and spiritual aura, it forms a perfect family spot for outings. The evening aarti forms the centre of attraction. \nJoy Senior Secondary School.\nFounded in 1986, Joy Senior Secondary School is one of the most renowned schools in Jabalpur. It is situated in Vijay Nagar too and is termed best in its educational facility all over the city. The school is CBSE affiliated and follows the NCERT norms with being the 1185th best school in the entire nation. The school focuses on the holistic development of their student and suggests play way as an effective method of teaching. The school has its suburb for junior classes and eventually the students are transferred to the main building. The school primarily focus on all major activities that can enhance the physical and mental well being of students, including yoga and sports. During the initial stages, the school began by being affiliated to the local state board and in 2003 it became a part of the Central Board of Secondary Education. The school has a motto which states - Children need Models, not Critics. This has been effectively showcased by the students who brought laurels to this institution in various activities. \nIn the year 1998, around 1200 students took part in a cultural activity of the school and sang 'Ranbheri', a patriotic song which was written by Lt. Shri Ram Kumar Bharatiya in 1930 during the Savinay Avagya Movement against the Britishers. The song was performed as a video and telecasted globally and made its position in the Limca Book of Records. The video is still on their YouTube page. "}

It is a compact neighbourhood that houses many areas of residence, schools, parks, provision stores and other recreational facilities. It is neighboured by other residential areas like Koramangala, Adugodi and Madiwala. The locality is known for its narrow roads and high slum population. It is also well known for the eviction of over 5,000 people who were a part of the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) of Ejipura, in order to build way for a shopping mall. \nHistory.\nEjipura is a direct extension of Vannarpet, that settled towards the East of Bangalore. Earlier, it was often known as Equestrian Grounds Puram, which later became E.G Puram. It was initially a colony that was situated next to the Equestrian Grounds that had been used by the army. The grounds were used by several workers who looked after the horses and their stables. \nCommunity.\nEjipura houses not only a strong rural population but also houses people from the North East and other Eastern cities like Bihar. It also consists of a large urban population, and several urban gated communities and apartments. \nEWS Eviction.\nDuring the start of the year 2005, BBMP had passed a decision which provided housing and residence on the same piece of land for the people residing in Ejipura. In early 2006, the BBMP had then issued for a rights/identification certificate to the residents of the locality. However, a Public Private Partnership between the BBMP and Maveric Holdings had come into contract and was signed in order to develop the same piece of land that was given to the EWS. \nAs a section of the joint development agreement, it was said that half of the land was then to be used in order to construct 1,512 EWS apartments. The other half of it was to be used by Maverick Holdings Corporation in order to build a mall. The eviction of residents had been stalled several times, even after several rights groups had staged protests, alleging that the projects seemed like a land scam. The citizen groups and protestors had accused the BBMP of constructing just 1,512 houses and residences within a site that could host up to 3,000 houses, by choosing to split the land equally with a private builder.\nFollowing directions of the Court order, the private builder, Maverick Holdings, alleges to have given a remuneration amount of Rs. 30,000 to families who had been evicted from the land. After this, an arrangement the government and Maverick had met half way and decided to build houses for the residents who took to the streets for shelter.\nThe project did commence only until recently. Due to the setbacks in starting the work, a group of original residents had filed a petition of contempt in the High Court, which questioned the delay in project commencement. Due to this, the court had requested that the Principal Secretary of the Urban Development Department (UDD) observe the happenings of the project and to submit a report to them. After having acquired the plan for the sanction to the EWS housing, the builders commenced the work in the year 2017. \nHistory of EWS Eviction.\nIn the year 1983, the Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BMP) that was in power at the time had begun the establishment of EWS houses in the new locality of Ejipura, at the price of Rs. 223 crore, employing a HUDCO loan. The residential project was completed in 1991. During the years 1993 to 1994, these residences were given to the EWS families, who had to previously apply in order to get the houses sanctioned. Exactly 1,512 houses had been constructed in within 42 blocks (36 houses in each block) within a 10.30 acre land.\nIn the year 1992, there was the construction of the Ejipura Quarters which was built for policemen to reside in. It was rejected by the police men because the standard of construction was defective and subpar. The civic agency had then assigned this facility to the EWS that were present in Ejipura. Some residents chose to stay while the others had rented it out. The buildings had then been discovered to accommodate several people that lived among the poor living conditions. On account of the poor formation of the building, walls and ceilings began to crack and killed 3 people in 2003. All the blocks of the quarters were then deemed unsafe for residence. Ever since these events took place, several people have been living by the side of the demolished residence in tin sheds. "}

Every Saturday the temple does the Benne Alankara which requires around 600 kgs of Butter and offered by the devotees.\nHistory.\nMahalakshmi Layout was a mostly barren land with small hills and rocks. After Independence, the place was called \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d as it was outside the Bangalore region. The deity was carved by a sculptor named Shanmugananda. He felt that the place had a spiritual aura and thus spent months sculpting Lord Hanuman, beginning with a sketch. Eventually, after completion, devotees began visiting the sculpture and engaged in doing Puja to the god. During the 1960s, Mahalakshmi Layout showed signs of developing. In the early 1970s, as the city expanded, and the hill was registered within the city limits, the local residents hired professional artists to enhance the earlier outlined sketch, into a grand painting of Lord Hanuman. By the mid-1970s, the authorities decided to turn the painting into a sculpture and formed a high-level committee (involving local residents) for this purpose. In 1976, the sculpture was ready and inaugurated by the Hindu tradition with their priests. PV Narasimha Rao was invited as the Chief Guest for the ceremony. By 1980, a 40\u00d740\u00a0ft temple was ready, which went on to expand into a 13-acre temple complex with the help of generous donations by devotees over the next few years, and it became part of the \u201cMust-Visit\u201d list of sightseeing in the city. Over the years, the Temple was developed by the devotees and by the local people and made it a full fletched place of worship.\nFestivals.\nHindu Temples are usually filled with festivals and celebration and this temple, in particular, celebrates important festivals like Hanuma Jayanthi, Sri Rama Navami, Annual Day Function, Sri Rama Pattabhisheka, Sri Rama Kalyanotsava and Lord Sathyanarayanan Pooja on Full Moon days, Lakshmi Pooja and other festivals in Shravana month. One of the most important events that take place is called the \"Benne Alankara\" in the month of August during which the deity is decorated with more than 500\u00a0kg of butter which is later given to the devotees as Prasadham\nPlace.\nSri Prasanna Veernanjeneya Swami Temple is in 12th Cross Road, Mahalakshmi Layout, Mahalakshmi Puram, Bangalore- 560086 (080 2349 1727). It is at a walkable distance from the Mahalakshmi layout metro station with a distance of 320m accurately. The entrance to the temple can be made from the main road through the park or from the side road too, where people park their vehicles. The temple is opened on all days of the week from 6:00\u00a0am to 12:30\u00a0pm and 4:30\u00a0pm to 8:30\u00a0pm.\nLocalities.\nAs the temple is on the main road and is in a residential area, there are a few fast foods, ice cream shops, juice centers right outside the temple. The temple is attached to a park that can be used as an early morning and evening recreation. There is Mahalakshmi Bus Stop a few steps from the temple or the metro station which is also walkable. Mahalakshmi Layout has a surrounding of other busy areas like Basweshwara Nagar, Malleshwaram, Yeshwanthpur. Iskon Temple is one stop away from Mahalakshmi Layout and Orion Mall that is within 1km distance from Iskon Temple."}

It is bordered by three of Indiranagar's main roads 100 feet road, 80 feet Road and Chinmaya Mission Hospital (CMH) road. The locality is a mixture of apartments and independent houses. Originally a settlement for defence veterans, today it is one of the most expensive localities in Bangalore. \nHistory.\nDefence Colony was originally a settlement of defence veterans started in the 1970s. The government allotted land to high ranking retired defence officers here. It was a sparse collection of Large Bungalows. At the time Indiranagar was a suburb, far outside Bangalore city. The Information Technology boom in the 1990s led to the rapid development of the neighbourhood, transforming Indiranagar into an upscale area. With increasing commercialisation of the surrounding areas, demand to live in this neighbourhood grew. As a result, property prices in Defence Colony rose over the years. Many of the owners sold their property to builders who put up apartments or developed it into apartments themselves. Today Defence Colony is largely made up of apartments. \nTransport.\nDefence Colony is located only a few minutes away from the Indiranagar Metro Station. Auto Rickshaws are easily available on the main roads bordering the colony. There are also three bus stops nearby. One of 100 ft road at 6th main, and two on CMH road at Indiranagar police station and Chinmaya Mission Hospital. \nCommunity.\nResidents Welfare Association.\nDefence Colony has a very active Residents Welfare Association. The Defence Colony Residents Association or DECORA is a voluntary association that looks after the interests of the residents of the colony. The association acts as a method for collective action by the residents. While the original function was to guard against illegal encroachment, the association also looks after civic amenities, residents welfare, security and communicates with local authorities to solve issues faced by residents. They have enforced zoning norms by shutting down 15 commercial establishments in the locality and protected two neighbourhood parks from encroachment. \nCrime.\nthe incidents of street crime has been increasing over the years especially during the night. Defence Colony and surrounding areas suffers from a high rate of street crime with incidences of chain snatching, harassment and robbery reported regularly. \nRecreation.\n100 feet road (that borders Defence Colony) is full of restaurants, pubs and high end retail shops. Within the Colony there are three parks, a children's park, a walking park and a senior citizens park, as well as a large open field. The children's park has playground equipment and lots of space for children to play. Opposite it is the walking park, which has a paved walking path surrounded by lots of trees, grass and other plants. The senior citizens park is a smaller version of the walking park exclusively for senior citizens. "}

{"id": "837973", "revid": "145452", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=837973", "title": "Kaikondrahalli Lake", "text": "Kaikondrahalli Lake is in Kaikondrahalli on Sarjapur Road, south east Bangalore and is spread over 48 acres of land. It is one of the traditional tank system in Bangalore which was created over hundreds of years ago and connected through a web of canals to different lakes. This was also used to provide water to the agricultural lands around the area. The region around the lake has encountered an expansion in land estate in the previous decade. \nAround the year 2000, the lake was filled up with fresh water and surrounded by various flora and fauna. By 2003, the lake had started to dry up as various channels to the lake was blocked due to construction and dumping of garbage. By 2007, the lake bed was a slushy bed of sewage and waste. This lake was later restored and is an example of urban commons revived by the local community with the help of the municipal corporation, BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike).\nRestoration.\nIn 2008, Priya Ramasubban, a documentary film maker and a local resident of Kaikondrahalli saw a report in the newspaper about a BBMP initiated rejuvenation program for the lake. Realising the then state of the Kaikondrahalli lake, she and other residents formed a small core group who invited other members with technical expertise to join them in the planning of rejuvenating Kaikondrahalli lake. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) had already been prepared and the budget had been sanctioned. The original DPR was looked into and redesigned to focus more on ecology than just the aesthetics of the lake park. Local residents contributed funds and collected hundreds of saplings of native species for plantation in the lake premises. Along with the local community, the then chief engineer of the lakes division of BBMP, Mr. BV Sathish coordinated with the local residents in the restoration of the lake.\nSome of the changes made from the original DPR were to retain as much area under water as possible as the area around the lake is dependent on ground water. Using inputs from a local architect, access to the lake was provided to lake visitors as well as to the children of the school adjacent to the lake, which originally had to be fenced off from the lake. Washrooms were constructed and it could be used by the lake visitors and the school children. To prevent the main lake from getting polluted, the DPR was redesigned to build a separate enclosure at the corner of the lake for the immersion of idols during Ganesh Chaturthi and other religious festivals. The infrastructure was completed and water started flowing in after four years from its commencement of restoration. The small core group residents formed themselves into a non-profit trust called MAPSAS (Mahadevapura Parisara Samrakshane Mattu Abhivrudhi Samiti). The lake has been restored and maintained jointly by MAPSAS, BBMP and the local community. \nOn February 4th, 2012, Nobel Laureate, Elinor Ostrom, American political economist, visited the Kaikondrahalli lake to look at its restoration work by the local community. A plaque regarding the same has been installed next to a jackfruit tree planted by Elinor Ostrom.\nMAPSAS.\nThe group of residents responsible for the rejuvenation of the Kaikondrahalli lake formed a non-profit trust called MAPSAS (Mahadevapura Parisara Samrakshane Mattu Abhivrudhi Samiti) in 2011. The trust was formed to rejuvenate and maintain the chain of lakes such as Parappana Agrahara lake, Kudlu Dodda kere, Kudlu Chikka kere, Haralur lake, Kasavanahalli lake, Kaikondrahalli lake and Saul kere from the Parappana Agrahara series and Dodda Ambalipura, Chikka Ambalipura, Ibblur and Bellandur form another chain nearby. MAPSAS and the BBMP are jointly responsible for maintenance of these lakes. While the BBMP takes care of the initial big investments on infrastructure, MAPSAS takes care of the other aspects of daily maintenance. \nKere Habba.\nKere Habba (Lake festival) is an annual celebration of the lake at the Kaikondrahalli lake. It features organic and eco-friendly santhe, live music performances, storytelling sessions, workshops, activities and a conference. This is a one-day sunrise to sunset event which focuses on two objectives \u2013 to show the significance of lakes and as a fundraiser for the maintenance of the lake. On 16th February, 2020, MAPSAS along with BBMP conducted its 6th edition of this festival which took place from 6am to 6pm, with events such as the bird walk, kere run, photography workshop, puppet show, storytelling, Yakshagana, etc. \nFundraiser.\nAs the resources reduced for the monthly maintenance of the lake, in 2017 four residents from around the lake, Pushpa Krishna, Rinaz Mohammad, Padma Srinivas and her husband Srinivas Sampath, took part in the 42 km Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (SCMM) and individually started a fundraiser on Milaap for the upkeep of the lake. Altogether they raised up to nearly 3.3 lakhs for the maintenance of the Kaikondrahalli lake. Other than this, every year, Kere Habba is celebrated which is also a fundraiser collected through various stalls and activities conducted from sunrise to sunset on one particular day. \nFlora and Fauna.\nIn 2014, a survey was conducted to identify the various Flora and Fauna species at the Kaikondrahalli lake. According to the survey, around 43 species of birds, 26 species of reptiles and 3000 plants comprising at least 33 varieties have been identified. Many migratory birds also visit this biodiversity lake from October to March. This in turn gathers many photography enthusiasts and bird watchers to the lake.\nFacilities.\nThe park has various facilities such as walking/jogging pathway, washroom, play areas, parks, cycling tracks, butterfly garden and an amphitheatre. People can also bring their pets with them to the park from 5am \u2013 11am and 3pm to 7pm. \nPost restoration.\nIn the recent years, the lake has been suffering from algal growth and stench due to the sewage entering the lake from a close by private property. To resolve this issue MAPSAS had taken an initiative to pour Effective Microorganism (EM) solution into the lake. Few days after that, MAPSAS and volunteers from around the area gathered to make bokashi balls (Japanese technique that clears off sludge) to dump in the lake. It was made using the bokashi powder (containing sawdust and husk), mixed with cow dung, red mud sludge from the lake, jaggery and effective microorganism (EM) solution. This mixture was then rolled into balls and left to activate, after which it was dumped in the lake. \nDuring every summer, since 2018, the lake water has had algal bloom and the stench. Pouring of EM solution and dropping Bokashi balls into the lake has only become a temporary solution. MAPSAS also took initiative in seeking the BBMP Lakes team\u2019s help in initiating an underground drainage system to diverge sewage water from the lake, as a long-term relief. The BBMP has thus decided to spend Rs.3 crore for constructing diversion drain at Kaikondrahalli lake. \nFilms.\nIn 2013, as an initiative by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Swedish University, a documentary film, 'Kaikondarahalli lake \u2013 The Uncommon Story of an Urban Commons', was released. Harini Nagendra, an ecologist and a community member of the Kaikondrahalli lake was approached by Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom to do a research project on the conservation of the Kaikondrahalli lake by the local community. The film was has two versions- a three minute clipping to screen during seminars and conferences and a longer version which was uploaded to the biodiversity page of the university website."}

Mr. Krishnappa began his political career in the year 1985 when he was elected as MLA. He represented the Varthur Assembly Constituency. Krishnappa stayed with the Congress Party (India) for almost three decades, left the party, and joined the Janata Dal (Secular) in the lay-in to the Assembly elections.\nPolitical career.\nHe contested as the Janata Dal (Secular) candidate from Tumkur parliamentary constituency in the ongoing elections and was confident of winning the seat. Being a former minister and a leader of backward classes as well, he was elected as the state JD(S) president in the month of September 2013 after H D Kumaraswamy called it a day to give up his position. While Mr. Krishnappa served at the Varthur constituency for almost four courses, that is twenty years in total and worked as a Minister for Animal Husbandry, Social Welfare, Horticulture, and Sugar. \nAfter joining the JD(S) party, Mr. Krishnappa filled the post left by the former Chief Minister of Karnataka, H.D. Kumaraswamy. Kumaraswamy resigned from the post holding moralistic liability for the inadequate enforcement and performance of the party during those freshly decided bypolls in 2013. Following the polls, Mr. Deve Gowda said to press persons of The Hindu that by naming A. Krishnappa, one thing had been confirmed. It is that the JD(S) was not a political party of father and son as it was claimed by other political critics. \u201cThis is the testimony of the party\u2019s concern for backward classes,\u201d as mentioned in the news reports. \nIn the year 2015, The BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) election concerning the wards within the K R Puram Assembly Constituency had transformed into a personal argument in between the Congress MLA, Byrati Basavaraj, and former BJP MLA, N. S. Nandiesha Reddy. Until the year 2008, this constituency remained a Congress stronghold that was represented by Mr. A Krishnappa. But, Nandeesh Reddy gained victory in the assembly election during 2008 directing the BJP swing. This party, BJP further succeeded to acquire eight out of nine wards in the 2010 BBMP elections. Congress, on the other hand, acquired a win solely in the Basavanapura ward in K.R.Puram. It was a time where a Congress win would accommodate Basavaraju to additionally strengthen his post and make an appearance as the new leader in Bengaluru. While for Nandeesh Reddy, a win would encourage him to recover his grip on the constituency.\nAfter Nandeesh Reddy lost the assembly elections in 2013, he effected to show the way to Mr. Krishnappa\u2019s daughter meeting corporator, Mrs. Poornima Srinivas, into the BJP. She had contested from the K R Puram ward. The news reports show that Mrs. Poornima believes that her father\u2019s struggles and encouragement would support her to survive and withstand the party. \nIn the year 2013, N. Dharam Singh, former chief minister of Karnataka, Mr. Krishnappa along with a few other corporators of K R Puram looked over and examined the hanging bridge of Krishnarajapuram that was initiated on January 26, 2003, by the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\nPassing away.\nMr. Krishnappa was the chairperson of the South East Asian (SEA) Education Trust. This former state president of JD(S) departed his life on April 23, 2014, Wednesday after undergoing a cardiac arrest. Mr. Krishnappa suffered a heart attack in the evening while he was playing badminton in his SEA college of Engineering at Ayyappa Nagar circle in K R Puram.

Soon when he was rushed to the K R Puram Super Speciality Hospital, Dr. Ravi, who examined him, announced that Krishnappa had obstructed his arteries and departed his life at the age of 68. \nMr. Krishnappa\u2019s body was brought to BVN High School in Devasandra, where he served as a committee member for more than a decade. It was kept for his supporters, companions, and other people to look at him for the last time. After which the news sources stated the mortal remains of Mr. Krishnappa was kept at his Devasandra home near K R Puram for people to advance respect and homage for the last time. \nOther information.\nAt the age of 68, Mr. Krishnappa's total assets were Rs. 70,18,33,242. In another media communication with the Deccan Herald, Mr. Krishnappa had stated that for him playing badminton was the most reliable means of resting. He further told that he never seemed exhausted despite traveling essentially around 80 to 160 kilometers per day for election campaigning. \nA statue and a Mahal have been built in his SEA education institution to commemorate him.

It is the last episode of the season (the season finale). It was first broadcast on the Fox network on August 27, 1992. \nIn the episode, Mr. Burns gives Homer Simpson $2,000. Homer loans the money to his homeless half-brother Herb Powell. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder. Rich Moore is the director of the episode. Danny DeVito guest stars as Herb and Joe Frazier guest stars as himself. Herb was in the episode \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\" where Homer makes him bankrupt. Many fans thought that episode had a sad ending. Producers of \"The Simpsons\" made the episode \"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\" because of that. \nStory.\nMr. Burns learns that Homer Simpson is sterile because of his power plant's radiation. He gives Homer a fake award, $2,000, and makes him sign a wavier that does not let him sue Mr. Burns. Homer wants to buy a vibrating chair with the $2,000. His half-brother Herb Powell asks Homer to loan him the money. Herb was a car manufacturer before Homer made him bankrupt and homeless in the episode \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\". Homer goes him the money. Herb sees a baby cry and makes a machine that lets people know what babies say. Herb's machine makes him rich and successful again. Herb gives Homer the money back and gives the Simpson family gifts. Herb forgives Homer for making him bankrupt and buys him the vibrating chair Homer wanted.\nProduction.\n\"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\" was written by John Swartzwelder. Rich Moore is the director of the episode. The episode was broadcast later in the 3rd season because the Fox network wanted producers to make another episode to be broadcast in the summer. Writers, animators, and producers had to work longer to make the episode. The idea of the vibrating chair came from one of the writers. They bought a vibrating chair to relax after working long hours of making the episode.\nThe reason another episode with Herb was made was because fans were sad that Herb became bankrupt in \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\". This episode was made to show Herb getting rich again. One of the producers wanted Herb to say \"I have an idea!\" at the end of the \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\". They instead made it into the story of this episode. Producers liked Danny DeVito as a guest star in the first episode with Herb and got him back for this episode. However, Hank Azaria said that DeVito was not as happy to guest star again. He said \"The second time, Danny DeVito was like 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's get it over with.' He did a great job, but he didn't enjoy the process.\"\nWriters of the episode had many ideas of what Herb would make to get rich again. The script of the episode had too many pages, so some parts of the episode were taken out. One of the parts that was taken out was Herb trying to get on a train to the Simpsons' town Springfield. Writers later put this idea in the season 8 episode \"Burns, Baby Burns\". There was going to be a joke about the Soviet Union breaking up. This was not put in the episode because the Soviet Union broke up after the episode was done being written (and it was not broadcast yet).\nJoe Frazier guest stars as himself in the episode. He was in Burns' ceremony for Homer's fake award. Al Jean said that it was hard for Frazier to say the word \"excellence\" right. George Meyer said that Frazier said it right after 20 tries. The episode was going to show Barney Gumble beating Frazier in boxing. Frazier was a world heavyweight championship before. Frazier's son did not want that part of the episode to be shown. He said that Frazier was a world champion, \"and a world champion does not get knocked out. My dad has only been knocked down twice, and that was by George Foreman.\" Producers wanted Foreman to be in the episode, but they could not get him in.\nReception.\nThe episode got a Nielsen rating of 10.7. This means that the episode was seen in about 9.76 houses. It got the second best ratings of the week on the Fox network (the first being the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards).\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\") liked the episode. Parts of the episode they liked the most were Homer in the vibrating chair and Maggie using Herb's machine for babies. David Eklid from \"The Guardian\" said that this episode, \"Lisa's Pony\", and \"Stark Raving Dad\" make the 3rd season \"pretty much the best season of any television show, ever.\" Nathan Ditum from \"Total Film\" thought that the episode referencing the movie \"\" was one of the best movie references of \"The Simpsons\".\nNate Meyers from Digitally Obsessed talked good about Herb being in another episode. Meyers said that Herb is \"a perfect sibling\" for Homer and said the episode has \"plenty of laughs\". Bill Gibron from DVD Verdict liked the jokes about the vibrating chair and thought that producers did a good job of putting Herb in another episode.\nColin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide thought that DeVito being the voice of Herb \"helps make the show more successful\" and said \"they really need to being him back one of these days.\" Tom Adair from \"The Scotsman\" called it a classic episode. Bill Gibron thought that DeVito was a good choice for Herb. He said that he is the opposite of how Dan Castellaneta does the voice of Homer. Nathan Ditum put DeVito on his list of the 20 best guest stars of \"The Simpsons\"."}

It was set up by the Egyptian government to replace the Suez Canal Company in the 1950s, which resulted in the Suez Crisis. After the United Nations declared, the three invading countries (France, Israel, The United Kingdom) were forced to withdraw.\nEstablishment.\nThe Suez Canal Authority is an independent authority having legal personality. It was established by the nationalization act signed on 26 July 1956 by the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The act at the same time nationalized the company and transferred all its assets and employees to the SCA established by this act.\nThe main office is located in Isma\u00eflia. In Port Said, the administration building of the earlier Suez Canal Company is used. Its board of directors comprises 14 persons, including the chairman and managing director.\nAssets, duties and responsibilities.\nThe authority owns the Suez Canal and all areas, buildings and equipment is maintained. SCA issues the Rules of Navigation, specifies the tolls for the use of the canal and collects them. The tolls are expressed in XDR and collected in several currencies. In 2008, the total revenue in tolls was 5,381.9 million USD for the passage of a total of 21,415 vessels - resulting in an average toll of 251,314.5 USD per vessel.\nSCA is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Suez Canal, for the safety of the traffic and access. According to the nationalization act, SCA is bound by the 1888 Convention of Constantinople, which grants the right of free access and use of the canal at equal conditions to all ships, commercial ships and ships of war, in times of peace or of war, even to ships of bitterparties.\nSCA is responsible for the computerized traffic management supported by radar, for the 14 pilot stations and their pilots. Since 1996, SCA operates the \"Maritime Training and Simulation Center\" for its pilots. SCA operates some 60 ships and boats, such as tugs, dredgers, cranes, and smaller boats.\nAccording to SCA's website, its facilities also include 114 ferry connections with 36 ferry boats; the Ahmed Hamdi road tunnel; the Nile Shipyard; the roads alongside the canal; a silk production in a farm using treated sanitary waste water for waste; water plants in the canal cities; 12,000 housing units; a hospital in Ismailia and emergency hospitals at both ends of the canal; 4 schools and various sports and recreational centers."}

It is considered to be one of the top 5 beaches, the northern end of which is connected to the main beach of Gokarna and the southern part, connected to Om beach. The lack of easy accessibility to the general public renders it as a neat, natural, cleaner and less crowded location to witness the sunset. There are no roads leading to Kudle beach which is further up north of Om beach, surrounded by hills on both ends. Recently, Kudle Beach had made news as it was claimed to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman as per Valmiki Ramayana, which was asserted by head of Ramachandrapura Mutt in Shivamogga. Water sports, scuba diving and boating attract enough tourists to the beach. It is usually visited for a time period of two-three hours.\nAccessibility.\nKudle beach can be easily accessed by train and bus. There are no direct flights to Kudle. Rental services like cab can also be availed. By train, the nearest railway station is the Madgaon railway station and the biggest railway station nearby is the Ankola railway station, which is about 20 kms from the beach. The local station, Gokarna railway station is only 3 kms away from the Kudle Beach. This is a small railway station and hence not quite often travelled by. From the train station, one can reach Gokarna city by bus or auto.\nBuses ply to Gokarna from all the major cities. From Mangalore and Bangalore, the buses are overnight (5-10 hours). The common point for buses coming from other station is the Shivamogga bus station from where, transport is available till Bangla Gudda.\nBy road, Bangalore is at a distance of 450 kms from Kudle beach, while the other main cities like Mangalore and Goa are at a distance of 235 kms and 147 kms respectively.\nThe nearest airport is the Daoblin airport, goa at a distance of 110 kms from the city. Bangalore and Mangalore have airports as well for traveling to Kudle beach.\nEnvironment.\nThe beach is famed for its natural, unpolluted water. The best time to visit is in winter from November till March when the temperature is 20-30\u00b0C. During summers, from April- june, the temperature rises up to 40\u00b0 C and during monsoon from July to October, the place receives a considerable amount of rainfall due to which the roads leading to the beach can get slippery and slushy. The beach consists of Sahyadri rocks and an expanse of white sand. Studies show that it might be vulnerable to sea erosion is high sand dunes are not established to be stabilised by vegetation. At times, Jelly fishes are washed across the shores as well.\nSediments.\nThey were found to be in the fine sand class. The mean particle size could be fixed at 2.017-3.18. While the morphology of the beach keeps changing, this could be attributed to the seasonal variations that occur. The various heavy metals that are found in the region are rutile, kyanite, zircon, hypersthene and magnetite.\nWater sports.\nThe various water sports are Kayaking that helps to move across the water, Jet skiing under a trained jet instructor in which the average power remains around 100-135 hp and Banana boat, a banana shaped boat for adult entertainment in which children are not allowed. Scuba diving, allows to get a view of the beautiful sea flowers and corals. Surfing can also be done when the waves are three to five feet tall.\nVisitor information.\nThere is no entrance fee, however for parking Rs.100 is taken. Everyone can visit it at any time of the day.It is advisable to visit it from 6 am till about 4 pm, after which it gets dark. Tourists visit the location for about 2-3 hours in general. There are no immediate medical facilities available near Kudle beach and as Kudle beach is in an isolated area, mobile connectivity is affected. "}

Its purpose was to spy on other countries using space stations. After some time, the program changed to using spy satellites instead.\nSince it is hard to hide a space station, the Soviets tried to keep the program a secret another way. They pretended the stations were civilian and gave them names in the Salyut series. The Salyut stations (such as Salyut 1) were normally to learn about how to live in space.\nThe Almaz program sent three stations to space, but the first failed. In the later years of the program, satellites were used instead since they are cheaper.\nSpace stations.\nThe Almaz program sent three space stations to space. These were Salyut 2, Salyut 3, and Salyut 5. These had large space telescopes to spy on other countries. The cosmonauts on the station operated these and used cameras to record what they saw.\nThe Salyut 3 station also had a large cannon, which was test fired once.\nSatellites.\nIn 1978, Almaz began to using spy satellites instead of space stations. Four were made as part of the program. These used radar to observe the ground instead of telescopes.\nThe first was Almaz-T which launched on 29 October 1986. The Proton rocket in launched on failed, and was destroyed by its safety system. The next was Almaz-T2, which went to space on 25 July 1987 and stayed in space for two years. The third was Almaz-1 which launched on 3 March 1991 and stayed in space for 18 months. A fourth satellite (Almaz-2) was built but never sent to space.\nLegacy.\nThe design of the Almaz space stations continues to be used even today. The Zarya module of the International Space Station is based on it. And before that, the Kvant-1 module of Mir was based on it."}

It is one of the few islands of Goa where human settlement exists, which is located on the west coast of the Indian peninsula. \nThe island is closest to the estuary's southern banks and is connected to the mainland via a bridge with a motor-able road named \"Silver Gate.\" The island is home to an abandoned lighthouse that is passionately protected by the locals. Close to the lighthouse, on top of the S\u00e3o Jacinto hill, stands a rebuilt St. Dominicks Peter &amp; Paul's Chapel which was first built in the late 50s. A church in the name of St. Hyacinth, the patron saint of the island, overlooks the waters of the river towards the east. On the last Sunday of September, the villagers hold a feast in honour of the church. \nThe local residents of S\u00e3o Jacinto, who are a fishing community, have been living there since the Portuguese times in beautiful little houses located in the South-West of the island consisting of both native Goan and typically Portuguese Goan architecture. Earlier, there used to be a causeway that would connect S\u00e3o Jacinto to the mainland. \nBiodiversity.\nThe island is home to a number of species and is considered a biodiversity hotspot, where species like the window-pane oysters, plate corals, clams, and crabs are found. The islanders, being protective, have taken the responsibility for ensuring a balance between species conservation and fishing for a livelihood. Having disallowed commercial use of the island and obstructing the advances of industrialization, San Jacinto remains a well-conserved treasure trove of nature and natural beauty.\nCoastal Zone Management Controversy.\nA report on the Coastal Zone Management Plan was released in 2021 and displayed at the Chicalim village Panchayat. The report failed to show any of the approximately 200 houses on the island, also stating that it hosts a chapel that dates back to 1771 and thus should be cleared off. The people of S\u00e3o Jacinto were upset with the draft and took measures to reach out to relevant persons to protest the ignorance of the management. Before releasing the document, the political leadership had even assured the inhabitants that all houses on the island will be included in the draft before having it scrutinized it for final publication. \nThe draft further listed the island under the Port Limits of Mormugao Port Trust. The reason behind this move is feared by the locals as it could allow the islanders to be at the mercy of the MPT which may transfer the serene land to industrial lobby groups and displace the people of S\u00e3o Jacinto in its stead.\nThe villagers have refused to accept the injustice meted out to them, strongly resolving to protect their homeland at all costs."}

The breed was created to combine the characteristics of both animals for beef production.\nBeefalo are primarily cattle in genetics and appearance, with the breed association defining a full Beefalo as one with three-eighths (37.5%) bison genetics, while animals with higher percentages of bison genetics are called \"bison hybrids\".\nHistory.\nAccidental crosses were noticed as long ago as 1749 in the Southern states of North America, during British colonization. Cattle and bison were first intentionally crossbred during the mid-19th century.\nThe first deliberate attempts to cross breed bison with cattle was made by Colonel Samuel Bedson, warden of Stoney Mountain Penitentiary, Winnipeg, in 1880. Bedson bought eight bison from a captive herd of James McKay and inter-bred them with Durham cattle. The hybrids raised by Bedson were described by naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton:\nAfter seeing thousands of cattle die in a Kansas blizzard in 1886, Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones, a co-founder of Garden City, Kansas, also worked to cross bison and cattle at a ranch near the future Grand Canyon National Park, with the hope the animals could survive the harsh winters. He called the result \"cattalo\" in 1888. Mossom Martin Boyd of Bobcaygeon, Ontario first started the practice in Canada, publishing about some of his outcomes in the Journal of Heredity. After his death in 1914, the Canadian government continued experiments in crossbreeding up to 1964, with little success. For example, in 1936 the Canadian government had successfully cross-bred only 30 cattalos.\nIt was found early on that crossing a male bison with a domestic cow would produce few offspring, but that crossing a domestic bull with a bison cow apparently solved the problem. The female offspring proved fertile, but rarely so for the males. Although the cattalo performed well, the mating problems meant the breeder had to maintain a herd of wild and difficult-to-handle bison cows.\nIn 1965, Jim Burnett of Montana produced a hybrid bull that was fertile. Soon after, Cory Skowronek of California formed the World Beefalo Association and began marketing the hybrids as a new breed. The new name, Beefalo, was meant to separate this hybrid from the problems associated with the old cattalo hybrids. The breed was eventually set at being genetically at least five-eighths \"Bos taurus\" and at most three-eighths \"Bison bison\".\nNutrition characteristics.\nA United States Department of Agriculture study found Beefalo meat, like bison meat, is lower in fat and cholesterol than regular beef cattle.\nRegistration.\nIn 1983, the three main Beefalo registration groups reorganized under the American Beefalo World Registry. Until November 2008, there were two Beefalo associations, the American Beefalo World Registry and American Beefalo International. These organizations jointly formed the American Beefalo Association, Inc., which currently operates as the registering body for Beefalo in the United States.\nEffect on bison conservation.\nMost current bison herds are genetically polluted or partly crossbred with cattle. There are only four genetically unmixed American bison herds left, and only two that are also free of brucellosis: the Wind Cave bison herd that roams Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota; and the Henry Mountains herd in the Henry Mountains of Utah. A herd on Catalina Island, California is not genetically pure or self-sustaining.\nDr. Dirk Van Vuren, formerly of the University of Kansas, however, points out that \"The bison today that carry cattle DNA look exactly like bison, function exactly like bison and in fact are bison. For conservation groups, the interest is that they are not totally pure.\"\nCattalo.\nThe term \"cattalo\" is defined by United States law as a cross of bison and cattle which have a bison appearance. In Canada, however, the term is used for hybrids of all degrees and appearance.\nIn some American states, cattalo are regulated as \"exotic animals\", along with pure bison and deer. However, in most states, bison and hybrids which are raised solely for livestock (meat and sale) purposes similar to cattle, are considered domestic animals like cattle, and do not require special permits."}

Hardwick was a 1986 United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) case that said that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution does not mean there is a a constitutional right for two people of the same gender to have sex. The case was about two men, so the exact words they used were \"homosexual sodomy.\"\nThe Supreme Court said that gay sex is not a deeply rooted right in American history and that it would not be possible for SCOTUS to create such a right without also creating a constitutional right to both adult incest and adultery. The majority opinion was written by Justice Byron White. The other justices who agreed were Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger and Justices Lewis Powell, William Rehnquist, and Sandra Day O'Connor. In a brief separate opinion, Chief Justice Burger said gay sex had been called bad for thousands of years, with William Blackstone calling gay sex worse than rape. The dissenting opinion came from Justices Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, William Brennan, and Thurgood Marshall. They disagreed with the majority opinion. Justice Blackmun said that the 14th amendment could create a constitutional right to have sex with another person of the same gender because of the right to privacy. He said that people have a right to be left alone and that saying this about gay sex did not mean people would be legally allowed to commit adult incest or adultery.\nSeventeen years later, the Supreme Court made the opposite decision. \"Bowers v. Hardwick\" was in the 2003 SCOTUS case \"Lawrence v. Texas\"."}

In reality it was a military station for spying on other countries. Most details of it were not known until after the Cold War was over.\nThe station had living areas for cosmonauts, engines, and solar panels. These were similar to other space stations. Due to its military nature, it also had some special equipment. There was a space telescope and several cameras, all for looking at the Earth. A small spacecraft called the Earth-return capsule stored film and could come back to Earth on its own. It was also possible for cosmonauts to develop film on the station and send back the images using a TV system. Salyut 3 also had an onboard cannon (large gun), based on a design used on aircraft.\nSalyut 3 was launched into orbit on 25 June 1974 by a Proton rocket. It stayed in space for 213 days before being burned up in the atmosphere. Starting on 4 July 1974 a crew of two cosmonauts stayed at the station for two weeks. Then on 26 August 1974 a second crew arrived but could not connect to the station and so had to return to earth. After this no other crews visited, but the station could do some tasks on its own. One was sending the Earth-return capsule back. The second was firing the cannon. This is the only time a gun has been fired in space. A total of 20 rounds were fired in 3 bursts.\nOn 24 January 1975 the station entered the atmosphere and burned up. It was followed by Salyut 4 which was a civilian space station.

The game is based on the animated series with the same name.\nGameplay.\nThe player controls Mac or Bloo. Both characters can throw paper balls, and you barely have to do that. Mostly you spend time collecting items to complete objectives. There are also three boss battles with Terrence, who mostly fires his slingshot and is accompinied by another enemy in the second and third battles. Mac and Bloo both have different abilities. Mac can slingshot paper balls (but only after the first fight with Terrence), double-jump to reach higher platforms, and duck to avoid flying objects. Bloo can roll his body into a ball to get into narrow spaces. Both of them have the abilities to slide down banisters, launch paper balls, talk to non-playable characters, and hide from enemies. Talking can give you an advantage. For example, every time the player would need to get up to a higher place that Mac can't double-jump to, if Wilt is around, talking to him will get him to lift the player up. Sometimes, you have to make it past enemies. Bendy is the most common enemy. He throws things down from above. Hitting him with a paper ball will make him cry and stop doing things for a short amount of time. Getting hit by an enemy will deplete the player's health, which is a row of three candies. Every time you get hit, you lose a candy, but you could collect more to replenish them. Dying will cause you to come from the door you last entered. The game has three minigames which can be unlocked by collecting Game-Hive tickets. When the player enters a door they might switch characters. The player is not in control of who they are using. Every time he or she enters a door, there is a chance of characters switching. In the final battle with Terrence and Duchess, the player can change between Mac and Bloo at any time."}

Balmuri Falls is around 16.5 kilometres away from the Mysore and 138 kilometres away from Bangalore. Not only can one experience these falls but they can also visit Edmuri Falls, that flows a few kilometres away.\nHistory.\nIts name is derived from the the local language, Kannada and is named so due to the direction that river flows in. \u2018Bala\u2019 in the state\u2019s language means, \u2018Right\u2019 while \u2018Muri\u2019 is \u2018Turn.\u2019 As the river flows slightly in a right direction, the dam thus, got its name. \nThe dam was constructed in attempts to hold water of the Cauvery River. It was mainly built to help and control irrigation of the fields surrounding the river. Once it fills up, river water falls down a length of 6 to 7 feet from over the dam wall. The length of the dam approximately 1.6 km and drops off into the flow of mini waterfall due to a descent of 6 feet. \nActivities.\nThe waterfall is open throughout the year for tourists but, it is most enjoyable from March to August. The summer time is apt to go for a dip or swim the Balmuri\u2019s waters. The water levels are also relatively low during these months, making it safe to take a walk or play in it. Winter months can be pleasant to visit as well.\nVisitors can choose this spot as a destination for picnics and leisurely strolls. There are also facilities for seasonal boat rides at the water cascade, when water levels are high enough.

The vicinity also has the Krishna Raja Sagara Dam (KRS) built on the Cauvery river. Brindavan Gardens stretches over 60 acres and is located 8 kilometres away from Balmuri Falls.\nDaria Daulat Bagh.\nThis tourist attraction is also situated near Balamuri Falls and is known to be the summer palace of Tipu Sultan, a king from the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is filled with history that visitors can experience, first hand. It stands 14 kilometres away from Balmuri Falls.\nNews.\nThough the falls have become a great tourist attraction, 48 deaths have been reported since 2008. Many of the youth from different districts in Karnataka have visited, some drowning to death. The depth of the water during the Monsoon season has been difficult to measure, causing many to drown. This has been caused due to numerous whirlpools that have acted as \u201cdeath traps.\u201d Authorities have reported many of the fatalities to be men under the influence of alcohol found at nearby shops. \nAt certain periods of time, authorities have had to close down access to the falls due to opening of the Krishnaraja Sagar Dam (KRS).

This was added trouble to the existing problem of pandemic caused by the virus, COVID19. Even before flood hit the areas, the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre predicted floods in the month of June itself, basing the observation on destruction caused in 2019 floods of the state. The flood fury was seen in 23 districts of the state, out of which the Malenadu region and all the districts of Coastal Karnataka were declared in flood zones. The districts like Belagavi, Kalburgi, Raichur and Bagalkot in northern part of the state received rainfall almost touching the highest of 21cms, which in normal conditions is as low as, below 10cms.\u00a0 The Malenadu regions like Bhagamandala, Aiyamageri received 647mm of rainfall on an average in the year 2020.\nCauses.\nApart from increased downpour in the state,\u00a0 many different reasons have been reported regionally. The capital of the state, Bengaluru is known to have more rainfall on an average, but in the last decade flood instances have cropped up time and again, it is attributed to amplified urbanisation causing stress on the natural resources, encroachment of flood plains, loss of vegetation and biodiversity, improper city planning leading to reckless constructions of sites and buildings. Along with these reasons, change in the river course of movement, deforestation and land modifications to accommodate tourists have been \u00a0the reasons for recurring floods and landslides in Malenadu region of the state. In northern Karnataka, heavy discharge of water from the Dams in Maharashtra and Karnataka, also aggravated the situation. Release of water from Ujjani Dam built on the river Bhima in Maharashtra rooted for flooding of 400 villages in Vijaypura, Kalburgi and Yadgir district. The Ghataprabha, Malaprabha, Tungabhadra, Almatti and Narayanapura, reservoirs were filled to the brim affecting Yadgir, Raichur, Ballari, Bidar, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Belagavi, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Gadag, Koppal, Haveri and Dharwad districts in north Karnataka.\nHumanitarian response.\nThe Karnataka Civil Administration called for a humanitarian response towards the destruction caused due to the floods. Twenty flood relief and ten Engineering Task force from Madras Engineering Group, Maratha Light Infantry Centre and Bison Division from Hyderabad were also employed to provide assistance in Yadgir, Gadag districts.

The breed is about about 1.45 m high. It can produce up to about 8,000 kg of milk per year (10,000 to 16,000 kg / year in top animals). It's milk is 4.2% fat and 3.4% egg white per liter (at high milk production the percentages may be slightly lower).\nHistory.\nThe Holstein Friesian could have originated after Frisian and Batavian cows were bred with each other, about 2000 years ago. Over the centuries, the cow is being used as a dairy breed. The breed was also popular abroad in the 19th century because of its high milk production. In the United States, Dutch cows were further bred. These cows were named Holstein-Friesian (the Holsteiners were introduced by German emigrants in the 17th century). In the second half of the 20th century, the descendants of the Dutch cows were cited in the Netherlands, because they produced more milk than the Dutch breeds Meuse-Rhine-Issel and Frisian-Holland. Since then, the black-colored Holstein-Friesian has been by far the most important cow breed in the Netherlands."}

(short for Carrozzeria Pininfarina) is an Italian car design firm and coachbuilder, with headquarters in Cambiano, Turin, Italy. It was founded by Battista \"Pinin\" Farina in 1930. On 14 December 2015, Mahindra Group acquired Pininfarina S.p.A. for about \u20ac168 million.\nPininfarina is employed by a wide variety of automobile manufacturers to design vehicles. These firms have included long-established customers such as Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, Fiat, GM, Lancia, and Maserati, to emerging companies in the Asian market with Chinese manufactures like AviChina, Chery, Changfeng, Brilliance, JAC and VinFast in Vietnam and Korean manufacturers Daewoo and Hyundai.\nHistory.\nThe days as a specialist coachbuilder.\nWhen automobile designer and builder Battista \"Pinin\" Farina broke away from his brother's coach building firm, Stabilimenti Farina, in 1928, he founded \"Carrozzeria Pinin Farina\" with financial help from his wife's family and Vincenzo Lancia. That first year the firm employed eighteen and built 50 automobile bodies.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter the war, Italy was banned from the 1946 Paris Motor Show. The Paris show was attended by 809,000 visitors (twice the pre-war figure), queues stretched from the main gate all the way to the Seine. Pinin Farina and his son Sergio, determined to defy the ban, drove two of their cars (an Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 S and a Lancia Aprilia cabriolet) from Turin to Paris, and found a place at the entrance to the exhibition to display the two new creations. The managers of the Grand Palais said of the display, \"the devil Pinin Farina\", but to the press and the public it was the successful \"Turin coachbuilder's anti-salon\".\nThe Ferrari partnership.\nIt started in 1951 with a meeting at a restaurant in Tortona, a small town halfway between Turin and Modena. This neutral territory was chosen because neither Farina nor Enzo Ferrari wanted to meet at the other's headquarters. Battista\u2019s son, Sergio Pininfarina recalled, \"It is not difficult to imagine how I felt that afternoon when my father, without taking his eyes off the road for one moment told me his decision as we drove back to Turin: \"From now on you'll be looking after the Ferrari, from A to Z. Design, engineering, technology, construction\u2014the lot!\"\u2014I was over the moon with happiness.\"\nThe move to large-scale manufacturing.\nFrom 1954 to 1955 Pinin Farina purchased land in Grugliasco, outside of Turin, for a new factory. \"The factory in no way would look like the one of Corso Trapani. It would be a car no longer on my measurements but on those of my children, built looking like them; I had this in mind and wanted it,\" said Farina.\nThe second generation of leadership.\nStarting with the planning for the new plant in Grugliasco in 1956, Farina started to groom his replacements\u2013Sergio his son and Renzo Carli his son-in-law. To his heirs apparent, Farina said of the Corso Trapani facility \"This old plant has reached the limits of its growth. It has no room for expansion and is far from being up to date. If I were alone I'd leave it as it is. But I want you to decide which way to go\u2013to stay as we are or to enlarge. Either way is fine with me. It's your decision to make and I don't want to know what it is. I'm finished and it's your time to take over. The future is absolutely up to you.\" In 1958, upon leaving for a world tour Farina added, \"In my family, we inherit our legacies from live people\u2013not from the dead.\"\nChange of corporate name to Pininfarina.\nIn 1961 at the age of 68, \u201cPinin\u201d Farina formally turned his firm over to his son Sergio and his son-in-law, Renzo Carli, it was the same year that the President of Italy formally authorized the change of Farina\u2019s last name to Pininfarina and the business took on the same name.\nPininfarina was run by Battista's grandson Andrea Pininfarina from 2001 until his death in 2008. Andrea's younger brother Paolo Pininfarina was then appointed as successor."}

After 2002, the encyclopedia's information was partially added into the later \"Great Russian Encyclopedia\" in an updated and changed form. The GSE said to be \"the first Marxist\u2013Leninist general-purpose encyclopedia\".\nOrigins.\nThe idea of the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia came\" in 1923 on the idea of Otto Schmidt, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In early 1924 Schmidt worked with a group which had Mikhail Pokrovsky, (rector of the Institute of Red Professors), Nikolai Meshcheryakov (Former head of the Glavit, the State Administration of Publishing Affairs), Valery Bryusov (poet), Veniamin Kagan (mathematician) and Konstantin Kuzminsky to draw up a proposal which was chosen in April 1924. Also involved was Anatoly Lunacharsky.\nContributors.\nContributors to the GSE are in this list.\nTranslations.\nEnglish.\nThe third version was translated and submitted into English in 31 books between 1974 and 1983 by Macmillan Publishers. Each book was translated separately, making use of the index found at the front of each book to locate specific items; knowledge of Russian can be helpful to find the right book the first time. Not all versions were translated into English; these are indicated in the index. Articles from the English version are made available online by TheFreeDictionary.com.\nGreek.\nThe third version was translated into Greek and submitted in 34 books between 1977 and 1983 from Akadimos publishing company (owned by Giannis Giannikos), which has also translated various Soviet encyclopedias and literature. All articles that were related to Greece or Greek history, culture and society were expanded and hundreds of new ones were written especially for the Greek version. The encyclopedia contains, for example, both the Russian entry on Greece as well as a much larger one prepared by Greek contributors. Each article written especially in the Greek version is marked with the note \"Greek version supplement\" (or \"\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2\" as written in the Greek translation).\nFinally, a supplementary book covering the 1980s was submitted in 1989. It contains translated and original Greek articles which, sometimes, do not exist in the 34-book set. The articles of the Greek version are being gradually made digital now; the digital books can be found on \"vivlio2ebook\" blog, which is dedicated on digital various books in Greek language.\n\"Great Russian Encyclopedia\".\nPublication of the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" was suspended in 1990 and halted in 1991, but in 2002 it was reinstituted by decree of Vladimir Putin. In 2003 and 2004 a team of editors overhauled the old encyclopedia by updating facts, removing most examples of overt political bias, and changing its name to the \"Great Russian Encyclopedia\". Many outdated articles are being entirely rewritten. In 2004 the first book of the newly overhauled \"Great Russian Encyclopedia\" was submitted. The complete version of 35 books was released by 2017.\nPublication of the \"Great Russian Encyclopedia\" is overseen by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and funded by the Government of the Russian Federation. The encyclopedia is now found in libraries and schools throughout the CIS.

These include Ranganatha Temple, Ganesha Temple, Basavanna Temple, Mulakantamma Temple and Shani Temple.\nAnother notable place close to Yemalur Main Road is Yemalur Bridge. It was constructed at the boundary of Yemalur Village to connect it to Bellandur Lake Road after there were complaints that the lake flooded into homes in Yemalur after heavy rainfall. This bridge paves the way between Bellandur and the offices at tech parks at Yemalur Main Road.\nSchools.\nThe schools in the Yemalur Main Road area are mostly primary schools, except for Neev Academy (which has classes up to high school). Neev Academy is located 550 metres away from Yemalur Bridge.\nThe primary schools in this area are as follows.\nLinks and Nearby Areas.\nYemalur Main Road has links to several locations.\nMarathahalli.\nMarathahalli lies to the East of Yemalur Main Road. 500 metres into the road, there is a kuccha road or walkway to go to Marathahalli market. You cannot drive through this path, only walk or cycle.\nYemalur Village.\nYemalur Main Road gets its name from being the road that takes you from HAL Old Airport Road to Yemalur Village.\nWind Tunnel Road.\nThe NAL Wind Tunnel Road begins where Yemalur Main Road ends. It provides a link between Yemalur and Bellandur to Murugesh Palya, Old Airport Road.\nBellandur Lake Road.\nA wide turning on Yemalur Main Road will take you straight to Bellandur Lake Road. This lake is commonly known as Snowfall Lake. This is because the pollution in the lake creates a stinky, white foam. This foam has even caught fire a few times.\nBellandur.\nThe Bellandur Lake Road starting in Yemalur is the way towards Bellandur. This will take you the Bellandur Main Road, which eventually leads out to the Outer Ring Road.\nHAL Flight Testing Centre.\nThe HAL Flight Testing Centre or HAL Airport runs adjacent to the Yemalur Main Road. Residents of this road are prone to hearing the loud noise created by the aircrafts while they take off and land. The noise has increased as of December 2020 because the Flight Testing Centre was made an airport for chartered aircrafts.\nKempapura.\nKempapura is the area between the end of Yemalur Main Road and the beginning of Wind Tunnel Road.\nAmbedkar Nagar.\nAmbedkar Nagar falls directly after Kempapura towards the direction of the East.\nProminent problems.\nOne of the main problems in homes and workplaces in and around Yemalur Main Road include the stench which comes from Bellandur Lake. The foam is another issue which causes major grievance to the residents in the area. This is accompanied with the flooding of several homes in Yemalur Village and neighbouring areas by Bellandur Lake. This often used to happen after heavy rains.\nAnother problem that residents of Yemalur Main Road and Yemalur Village have is the road problem. The narrow connecting street between Yemalur Main Road and Wind Tunnel Road is a 300 metre stretch which is terrible quality and has potholes all over it. This road is the official property of HAL Bengaluru, so the fixing of potholes is the responsibility of HAL. Due to lack of funds, this road has not been repaired.\nUpcoming Projects.\nHatha Coco Nest is an upcoming apartment building in the Yemalur Main Road area. Possession of flats in this apartment will begin in June 2021. Other recent constructions in the area include Sai Smaran Sai Garden, Prestige Kew Gardens, Rohan Jharoka II Apartments, R.S. Green View Apartments and Sai Johith Homes."}

The other breeds merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels. Originally from East Asia, toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They were often seen with English royalty and were made famous by their association with King Charles II. They are very closely related to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the two were considered the same breed until 1945 when the Kennel Club divided them into two seperate breeds. This breed has a smaller skull and shorter nose than the Cavalier.\nColours.\nThese dogs come with four different types of coats (which came from the four breeds that contributed to making this breed):\nTemperment.\nUsually very contented but can get excited when around children.

The Inquiry made various suggestions about this topic, some of which were adopted and some of which weren't adopted. Some members of the Inquiry ended up creating the Council on Foreign Relations (which is independent from the U.S. government) later on.\nThe Inquiry's suggestions.\nThe Inquiry said that the German Empire should give Alsace-Lorraine back to France, that France should get the parts of the Saarland that it controlled before 1815, that the Rhineland should be demilitarized, that Belgium stop being neutral, that Belgium should get some territory in the Maastricht and Malmedy regions, that Luxembourg should either be annexed to Belgium or have its independence brought back, and that there should be a vote in northern Schleswig to decide whether it will stay with the German Empire or rejoin Denmark. The Inquiry also said that if Russia could become a real democratic federation, then the Baltic states (other than Lithuania) and Ukraine should reunite with Russia since this would be in the best economic interests of everyone. The Inquiry also said that if the Bolsheviks will keep control of Russia, then the independence of both the Baltic states and Ukraine would have to be recognized on the condition that there would be a vote in these territories on a future reunion with Russia once Russia will stop being ruled by Bolsheviks. The Inquiry's proposed borders for Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine were very similar to the borders that these countries had after 1991 in real life, with the Inquiry even saying that Ukraine should get Crimea. The Inquiry also said that Finland should be given its independence, that the Aland Islands should be given to Sweden, that an independent Poland be created along with a Polish Corridor so that it could have secure access to the Baltic Sea, that Poland and Lithuania should reunite, and that the door should be kept open for Poland to get both eastern Galicia and the Belarusian-majority territories to its north. The Inquiry said that Wilsonian Armenia should get independence and also that both Georgia (country) and Azerbaijan should get provisional independence, with the Inquiry having a favorable view of the idea of a future union between Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.\nThe Inquiry said that Czechoslovakia should be created in roughly the same borders that it was created in real life, with a combined Czech and Slovak majority but also with sizable German, Hungarian, and Ukrainian (Ruthenian) ethnic minorities. Similarly, the Inquiry's advice for Romanian expansion (into Transylvania, Bukovina, the eastern Banat, et cetera) and the creation of Yugoslavia were also followed. The Inquiry also said that Italy should get a northern border slightly to the south of the Brenner Pass in order to reduce the number of Germans who would end up under Italian rule without weakening Italy's security; this advice was not followed since Italy got the Brenner Pass border. The Inquiry also said that Italy should annex Istria but not Fiume due to the latter's importance for Yugoslavia but in spite of this, Italy ultimately ended up annexing both of these territories. The Inquiry said that both German Austria and Hungary should acquire and keep their independence and that Austria should not reunify with Germany\u2013at least not yet. Also, the Inquiry said that Hungary should keep the Burgenland until it actually becomes clear that its people actually want to join German Austria.\nThe Inquiry gave no advice for Albania due to the complexity of the situation there. However, it did say that Constantinople should be made into an international state, that an independent Turkish state to be created in Anatolia under a League of Nations mandate, that independent Mesopotamian and Greater Syrian states should be created under League of Nations mandates, and that the option of an Arab confederation that includes both Mesopotamia and Syria should be kept option for the future. The Inquiry said that an independent Palestinian state under a British mandate should be created in Palestine that would also be a Jewish national homeland where Jews would be free to settle and would have their rights and freedoms respected. The Inquiry kept open the door to Palestine eventually getting a Jewish-majority population as a result of mass Jewish immigration into there. Finally, the Inquiry said that the King of Hejaz should not be given help to impose his rule on unwilling Arab tribes."}

Pittoni's \"Venus and Mars of Warsaw\" painting is characterized by elegance, lightness, richness of bright colors and Rococo. Pittoni is a virtuoso in rendering the textures of objects and the structures of fabrics. His most precious works have within them representations of \"blue fabrics\", named as \"Blue Pittoni\". In the National Museum of Warsaw, there are two paintings by the master Pittoni, which complement a pair (pendant), which complement each other in terms of composition and theme.\nThe two works depict famous couples from ancient mythology: \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" (inv. No. M. Ob.659) and' 'Mars and Venus\" (inv. No. 47099). The heroes of the paintings are the figures of lovers facing each other, they are arranged in such a way that a figure is slightly higher and are accompanied by figures of cupids emerging from a fleshy and folded matter.\nIn the painting of \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" there is an allusion to the story of Ariadne and a branch of a vine, treated almost like the scepter of the god of fertility and wine, Bacchus. The scenes are set on swirling clouds, with patches of blue sky shining. In \"Mars and Venus\"the goddess appears to be looking down as she takes the arrow from Cupid's quiver, and perhaps is about to stab someone with it. With a playful smile, one of the cupids also looks down, the one sitting on the spear of Mars, as if he has already seen the future sacrifice of the goddess of love.\nThe paintings of \"Pittoni in Warsaw\", dated around 1720, are an excellent example of the Rococo style. They are kept in soft colors with pastel and pearl tones. The luminous skin of the figures is surrounded by intense patches of yellow or green drapery and the precious \"Pittoni blue\". Pittoni perfectly combines and renders light and airy materials (clouds and feathers) with heavy elements, such as the helmet of Mars or the quivers of Cupid.\nBacchus and Ariadne were on the left, and Mars and Venus on the right. At that time, they formed a closed composition with figures of Bacchus and Mars facing each other. Both images use synthesis, and a bottom-up perspective, indicating that they have been positioned high up and intended to be viewed from below. They are painted freely, almost cast, without defining outlines and details, which also shows that they were not created to be observed closely. Thanks to this artistic style, the compositions seen from afar take on air and lightness, joyful and elegant because they are destined for the high nobility."}

It is a prime housing locality in the city boasting various dignitaries and cinema actors as its residents. It also houses bureaucrats from UAE, which holds a permanent residence in the colony. The center of the colony holds a single storied commercial building featuring small local business. Recently, various upscale cafes have also made made their debut in the area increasing the face value of the posh colony.\nHistory.\nJawahar Nagar, established in November 14, 1964 is the first planned residential residential colony in the state of Kerala. The colony was developed under the leadership of then Chief Town Planner, Thomas Paulose, who is still a resident of the colony. Before it was named Jawahar Nagar, the area was refereed to as Maracheenivila. Maracheeni translates to Tapioca in Malayalam. This was in reference to large tapioca farms that were cultivated on the land. In the late 1800s, during the reign of Ayilyam Thirunal Rama Varma, king of the princely state of Travancore, tapioca was imported into the country from Brazil to fight a famine that hit the state. This process in turn made Jawahar Nagar the first area where tapioca was locally cultivated in India. A research center was also established within the locality. This center was later transformed into the Jawahar Nagar Lower Primary School during the redesigning stages.\nThe entire colony was modeled after the British Housing Scheme with playgrounds, wide roads and a welfare association. The colony also houses Saraswathy Nilayam, the first multi-storied apartment building to be constructed in the city, and overall second in the state.\nTransportation.\nPublic transportation do not ply along through the locality with the exception of auto-rickshaws and taxis. Nevertheless, the colony is situated right beside Kowdiar Main Road next to the Kowdiar Palace. The juxtaposition of the colony makes it convenient for its residents to get in and out of the bustling city life.\nCommunity.\nSchools.\nJawahar Nagar Lower Primary School and Nursery is the oldest school in the locality. In recent years, multiple daycare centers have commenced operations, namely L'ecole Chempaka Daycare and Nursery. They have also started L'ecole Chempaka International Primary School for classes from LKG to 5th grade.\nResidents Association.\nThe Jawahar Nagar Resident Association is in charge of all activities concerning the locality. It conducts Annual General Body meetings to decide on various matters concerning the colony. It is also in charge of maintaining the K.P.K Menon Memorial Playground and the badminton court nearby which has been allotted to the sole use of the residents of the locality. The initiative undertaken by the association has made Jawahar Nagar in getting voted the cleanest colony in Thiruvananthapuram on multiple occasions\nNotable Residents.\nJawahar Nagar has been the choice of residence for multiple eminent personalities. Some of them are EMS Namboothiripad, K. Karunakaran, actor Mohanlal, Thikkurisi Sukumaran Nair, V.K. Krishna Menon, etc. The Raj Bhavan, where the Governor of Kerala resides, is situated adjacent to the colony with two entrances to the house located within the locality. The colony also hosts dignitaries from the UAE, which holds two houses within the locality. The members working at the UAE Consulate reside here."}

The German-majority city of Danzig was not a part of the Polish Corridor but was instead made a free city under League of Nations rule. Weimar Germany's various governments did not accept the new German-Polish border as being permanent and hoped to change this border later on through negotiations. In March 1939, Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler said that Poland should agree to Danzig's reunion with Germany and also to the idea of building extraterritorial highways across the Polish Corridor. Poland rejected this proposal and instead got Anglo-French guarantees against Nazi German aggression. Then, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 over this issue, Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany and World War II began."}

In the 1860s, whole colonies of Czech farmers began moving to Ukraine, mostly to Volhynia in western Ukraine. After the Russian Empire (which ruled over Ukraine back then) abolished serfdom in 1861, Czechs could buy former landowners' estates in western Ukraine at a decent cost. In 1870, Czechs (who were mostly farmers, at least initially) were allowed to become Russian subjects and almost all Volhynian Czechs eventually converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity, though some of them did remain Protestant, such as the Czech Brethren. By the start of the 20th century, the Czech population is what is now Ukraine reached 65,000. The Czechs thrived in Ukraine since they knew how to farm well and with modern farming machinery that they imported from Bohemia. After the end of World War I, the Volhynian Czechs were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union (which ruled over Ukraine back then), with around 20,000 Czechs in Poland and the Soviet Union (mostly in Ukraine and Crimea) each in the 1920s. After the end of World War II, most of the Volhynian Czechs moved to Czechoslovakia, though slightly over 10,000 of them stayed in Ukraine, mostly in Zhytomyr Oblast."}

Most of Volhynia was annexed by the Russian Empire in the late 18th century due to the partitions of Poland, but Austria also got to annex a small part of Volhynia during this time. In the early 19th century, Volhynia was still dominated by its Polish nobility, who continued to rule over the Ukrainian peasants who lived there. Volhynia experienced a Russification program in the 19th century and did not get to experience the Ukrainian national awakening that was going on in neighboring Galicia during this time. After the end of World War I, Volhynia was partitioned between Poland and the Soviet Union, with western Volhynia becoming a part of Poland and eastern Volhynia becoming a part of the Soviet Union, specifically a part of the Ukrainian SSR. Volhynia experienced a Ukrainianization movement in the 1920s but a lot of its notable Ukrainian intellectuals were later murdered in Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the late 1930s. In 1939, at the start of World War II, the Soviet Union conquered and annexed western Volhynia, which used to belong to Poland before that point in time. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa in 1941, Volhynia came under Nazi German rule for several years, when almost all of the Jews who were not evacuated by the Soviet Union ahead of time were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. When the Soviet Union won World War II and got Volhynia back from the Nazis, almost all of Volhynia's Germans and Czechs emigrated, in the former case to Germany and in the latter case to Czechoslovakia. In addition, after the end of World War II, a lot of the Poles in eastern Volhynia switched residences with the Ukrainians in western Volhynia, thus making both eastern Volhynia and western Volhynia much more ethnically homogeneous. Volhynia also saw some Russians and Belarusians move there during the time that it was under Soviet rule, thus increasing the populations of these two groups in Volhynia. Volhynia was historically primarily agricultural, with there being little industry there, especially in its western part. At the start of the 1930s, 78% of Volhynians worked in agriculture and only 8% in industry, and as late as 1987, 52% of Volhynians still lived in rural areas, with most of these people still making a living based on agriculture during this time."}

It can be used to contain solid waste. Most garbage bags today are made out of plastic. They are usually black, white, or green in color.\nPlastic bags are an easy and clean way of handling garbage. Plastic garbage bags are fairly light. They are useful for messy or wet rubbish. They are also used for wrapping up garbage to reduce it's smell. Plastic bags are often used for lining waste bins.\nIt was in invented in 1950 by Canadians Harry Wasylyk, Larry Hansen and Frank Plomp.

Some can decompose under specific conditions.\nColors.\nTrash bags or Trash liners usually come in different colors. However, these colors are not just made to make the trashes look good for the eyes. The colors usually show what kind of trash is supposed to go in them.\nHere are the meanings of the colors of the trash bags we see around:\n1.Black \u2013 is generally for non-biodegradable, non-infectious garbage such as plastic cans, Styrofoams, candy wrappers, etc.\n2.Green \u2013 is for biodegradable materials like left-over foods, vegetable and fruit peelings, leaves, twigs, etc.\n3.Red \u2013 is commonly used in hospitals for bio-hazardous wastes such as syringe with blood, test tubes, human wastes, etc.\n4.Blue \u2013 is usually used for industrial materials such as glass, heavy plastics, etc.\n5.Clear \u2013 is normally used to hold recyclable products like cans, bottles, papers, etc."}

He is best known as the founder of Hankyu Railway, the Takarazuka Revue, and Toho. He represented Japanese capital in government.\nDrawn to the Stage.\nKobayashi took inspiration from the youth ensemble that the Mitsukoshi Department Store had used to attract customers in Tokyo. This group of 20 to 30 fresh-faced teenage boy musicians, wearing Western-style clothes and feathered hats worn at an angle, were highly successful in publicizing the store. \u201cFor our Takarazuka New Spa,\u201d Kobayashi later wrote in \"Takarazuka oitachi no ki\" (The History of Takarazuka), \u201cwe imitated this group, and with guidance from Mitsukoshi set up a girls\u2019 musical theater group.\u201d\nKobayashi devoted so much energy to his Takarazuka project out of a love of drama that dated back to his childhood. He was born within sight of Mount Fuji in the city of Nirasaki in Yamanashi Prefecture. According to Muk\u014dyama Tateo, a visiting professor at the University of Yamanashi who lives in the city and has researched the life of Kobayashi, he came from a wealthy merchant family and at a young age frequently attended plays put on by a small theater near his elementary school. Even after entering Kei\u014d University, he continued to regularly attend theater and kabuki performances. He also enjoyed writing and had a novel serialized in the local Yamanashi newspaper.\nAfter graduating from university, Kobayashi joined and worked there for 15 years. In part because the staid life of a bank employee did not suit him, while working in Osaka he was attracted to the literary and theatrical world. He spent more and more time in the entertainment district and got to know the men about town who were regulars there. The experience and connections that Kobayashi built up during this time would serve him well when he launched his theater group.\nA Unique Atmosphere.\nOnly unmarried women can perform on the Takarazuka stage. Kobayashi wanted to present his audiences with a dream world far removed from everyday life, and this rule remains even today. Performers also had to undergo two years of hard training at Takarazuka Music School, based on its motto, \u201cPurity, Honesty, Beauty.\u201d This is the fundamental difference between Takarazuka Revue shows and western operas and musicals, which hold auditions for each new production.\nIn his history of Takarazuka, Kobayashi used a curiously domestic metaphor in describing his dream: \u201cIt would be impossible to train men in that way for our productions. In cooking too, perhaps only men can produce something truly excellent, but it is women who rustle up something quick for the family. There are currently between 400 and 500 Takarazuka students and we could not have so many if we included men. There would be non-stop fighting and arguments. There is no room for men in Takarazuka, and it has an atmosphere that could not be created without limiting it to women only.\u201d\nKobayashi\u2019s Many Pies.\nAside from theatrical activities, Kobayashi oversaw a number of creative entrepreneurial projects centered on the railway business that targeted ordinary consumers. He expanded the focus of his business from simply taking passengers from one point to another to include development of housing along the railway route and introduced Japan\u2019s first mortgage system. He also opened the Hanky\u016b Department Store at the railway\u2019s Umeda terminal building in Osaka, with an affordable caf\u00e9 on the top floor selling popular dishes like curry rice.\nIn 1938, when he was also CEO of Tokyo Electric (now TEPCO), Kobayashi set up Japan\u2019s first business hotel, Daiichi Hotel in Shinbashi, Tokyo, to accommodate businessmen on trips to the capital. And he was involved in the management of T\u014dky\u016b\u2019s railway business in its early days as well as the development of the exclusive Den\u2019ench\u014dfu residential district. \nAs a corporate executive, Kobayashi preferred to take on a wide-ranging role akin to a theater producer, rather than simply issuing orders. And he occasionally demonstrated the literary skills sharpened by fiction writing, as when he wrote, printed, and distributed 10,000 pamphlets to promote the Min\u014d Arima Electric Railway at the moment its launch was running into trouble, dubbing it the \u201cmost promising of rail companies.\u201d He was also known to write pamphlets to publicize the sale of land and new houses.\nKobayashi\u2019s acumen for public relations anticipated the sort of commercial messages we see today. His masterpiece in this vein came when he opened a line to Kobe in 1920 and produced a newspaper advertisement sniping at the crowded trains of his Hanshin rivals. \u201cOur new express trains between Kobe and Osaka are clean, fast, and nearly empty, with great views and cool carriages.\u201d It should not be surprising that he also wrote more than 20 theatrical pieces for the Takarazuka Revue.\nKobayashi later dabbled in politics. In 1940, he became the first private citizen appointed as minister of commerce and industry when he joined the cabinet of Konoe Fumimaro. However, disagreements with future Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke led to his resignation after less than a year. Following the end of World War II, in 1945 he was appointed minister of state and president of the War Damage Rehabilitation Board, but he was quickly purged from this position. \nAlthough Kobayashi\u2019s business interests covered a broad spectrum, he was \u201cmost interested in business activities related to people\u2019s everyday lives,\u201d according to Muk\u014dyama Tateo. \u201cIf there was no firm connection between his work and people\u2019s lives he felt it had no meaning for him.\u201d\nWhat he loved to work on most of all was Takarazuka, a kind of theater that ordinary people could easily attend. There were expensive seats, but there were plenty of cheap seats, too\u2014\u201clike outfield seats in baseball or third-tier seats in sum\u014d,\u201d Muk\u014dyama notes. \u201cPeople could go all year round. You don\u2019t have to be close to the action to simply enjoy a little culture. Isn\u2019t that what finding culture in our daily lives is all about?\u201d"}

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on September 17, 2006. In the episode, Peter Griffin's mother gets a divorce. She starts dating a news anchor. Stewie and Brian get a job at a radio station. The episode was written by Tom Devanney and James Purdum is the director of the episode. The episode was seen in about 9.23 million houses when it was first broadcast.\nStory.\nPeter's mother Thelma goes to his house to tell his family she is divorced. Peter and his wife Lois bring Thelma to a place for single people. She meets the news anchor Tom Tucker and starts dating him. Peter does not want them to date and tries to stop them. Tom tells Peter that he should just let Thelma be happy. Peter and Tom start to become friends. However, Thelma later leaves them and Peter thinks that he caused her to leave. Peter learns that it is imporant for fathers and their son to be with each other. He tells Tom to be with his son Jake more.\nBrian gets his own talk show on the radio where he talks to phone callers. He tries to make the show feel intelligent, but Stewie makes prank phone calls on the show. The radio station thinks Stewie's calls are funny and makes him part of the show. Stewie makes the show more humorous and offensive. Brian first does not like the change, but he likes it after seeing people liking the new show. Gore Vidal shows up in the talk show after Brian asked him to be in the show before it was changed. Vidal does not like the changes to the show and leaves. Brian gets angry at the changes and stops being part of it.\nProduction.\n\"Mother Tucker\" was written by Tom Devanney. James Purdum is the director of the episode. The radio station Brian worked for (called \"Weenie and the Butt\") uses many sound effects. The sound effects were made by people who sung at the Academy Awards. Seth MacFarlane (creator of \"Family Guy\") said that it took longer than normal to make the sound effects because they did not sound serious enough. Phyllis Diller guest stars as Peter's mother Thelma. Tamera Mowry and Gore Vidal are also guest stars in the episode. A part of the episode has Thelma trying to tell Peter that she is dating Tom Tucker. She says \"Tom here has won a local Emmy for his work with the retardeds\". The Fox network does not want the word \"retard\" or \"retarded\" to be broadcast on the network. However, this part of the episode was shown anyway. MacFarlane said he does not understand why Fox does not let them use the word retard, but other networks do. He said that this part of the episode made the mental health community angry. \nOne part of the episode would show why Tom's son Jake has an upside down face. This was not put on broadcast. A part in the episode shows the characters of \"Peanuts\" as older people. At first, this was going to be put in the episode \"Patriot Games\", but that episode was too long to put it in.\nReception.\nThe episode was watched in about 9.23 houses when it was first broadcast.\nDan Iverson from IGN said that the episode would make people who do not like \"Family Guy\" \"laugh pretty hard.\" Iverson thought that it \"won't be remembered as fondly as some of the episodes from the first few seasons.\" He thought the funniest part of the episode was showing how radio jockeys are \"immature\". Brett Love from TV Squad did not like the story with Peter, Thelma, and Tom. Love thought that the \"Stewie and Brian stuff was the best part of the episode\", but said that the episode was a \"slow start to the season\". Francis Rizzo from DVD Talk said that the story about radio is \"a perfect parody of everything that's wrong in radio.\""}

Team Guppy haven't been around long, and aren't particularly famous, so they don't get a whole lot of work. One day, they get a request from the Galactic Police to respond to a pirate attack on Jack Station, and they jump at the chance.\n\"Crime Crackers 2\" is the sequel to Crime Crackers, and is again a first-person action game in a similar style. It takes place two years after the original, following a team of Crackers who got into the business after being inspired by Team Pink Dolphin, the heroes of the first game. Just like the previous title, the player must explore each area, defeating enemies and collecting items until they find and defeat the boss.\nThere are several changes to the system since the first title. The most significant is the elimination of action mode: The player can now always attack forward, giving the game a faster pace than its predecessor, but still more deliberate than, say, Doom. The team size has increased to four, and again each member has their own specific abilities, as well as their own life and weapon energy meters.\nThe game is otherwise quite similar to the first game. The story is driven through communication from the support team during missions, as well as in animated cutscenes between them. There is also the option to buy and sell items between missions. The game also features a branching storyline with numerous endings, and will even keep track of which branches the player has played through."}

He was a founder of the City of Cork Co-operative Society (also serving as the society's secretary), and was the editor of \"The Cork Co-Operator\" publication. He was also manager and secretary of the Cork Co-operative Bakery Society. He was an organiser for the Labour Party in Cork, a regional trade union secretary and one of a number of early Labour D\u00e1il members to promote Christian socialism. Quill also served as a local councillor initially with Cork County Council from 1925 but served on both the County Council and Cork Corporation during the 1930s and 1940s. He also held positions on the executives of large agricultural organisations in later years.\nBiography.\nTimothy Quill was born to Daniel and Mary Quill in Clondrohid, Macroom, County Cork, on 9 May 1901. He had five siblings in total, all brothers. Initially living in Macroom, he moved to Cork City with his wife and young family, and in 1936 was living near Victoria Cross. Before his time in the co-operative movement, he was involved in the insurance business.\nQuill was a regional trade union secretary for North-West Cork. Quill, along with TJ Murphy and Paddy Crowley MCC, have been credited with establishing \"labourers' clubs\" in County Cork during the 1920s and 1930s. The clubs would meet after Mass and some were supported by parish priests. The clubs began to go into decline in the 1940s as farm machinery became more commonplace.\nQuill was a councillor on Cork County Council at the time of the June 1927 general election, having been elected in 1925. It has been said that he was recruited into the party by Labour politician and fellow Clondrohid native T. J. Murphy. Quill was 26 years old at the time of the general election on 9 June 1927 and was one of 44 Labour candidates in total. While campaigning, Quill described himself as a \"temperate man\". In June 1927, at a meeting in North Cork, Quill outlined what he believed the Labour Party stood for. Referring to the level of unemployment, he spoke about the \"right to work\" and the government's perceived failing of \"humbler people\" over the \"well-to-do class\". Quill was elected as a Labour Party TD for the Cork North constituency at the June 1927 general election, receiving 18% of first preference votes. Slogans, such as 'Be Labour This Time' and 'Away With Slums &amp; Mud Cabins' were featured on his election posters. He was the youngest member of the 5th Dail. He spoke against the Public Safety Bill 1927 in August 1927. During a finance committee debate on old age pensions in July 1927, he decried what he described as the \"strict and harsh manner\" of some pensions officers. Quill lost his seat at the September 1927 general election, serving only three months as a TD. He received 4,123 first preference votes. T. D. Keating of the ITGWU said that it was regrettable that Quill was not re-elected. The number of Labour candidates almost halved (from 44 to 28). Speaking on the heavy defeat for Labour in the September 1927 election, T. J. Murphy regretted that the party had lost candidates, like Quill, who he described as \"young men of the ability and honesty of Mr. Quill, who had been defeated in North Cork by a mere handful of votes, after making a marvellous fight against a combination of influences\".\nQuill did not contest the 1932 general election, declining to stand at a convention in Millstreet, Cork. According to \"The Southern Star\", it was thought Quill would be the chosen candidate, but, according to the newspaper's columnist, had \"to a certain extent, lost touch with the electors of this division and he declined to accept the honour\". According to the \"Cork Examiner\", having been proposed and seconded, Quill declined the nomination and asked \"that some other candidate [\u2026] be proposed\". In a letter published in \"The Southern Star\" in June 1933, Quill labelled criticisms levelled against him and the Labour movement as 'ignorant'. As of 1936, he was Chairman of the Cork County Executive of the Labour Party. Quill contested the 1937 general election as a sitting city councillor on the Cork Corporation, as one of 23 Labour candidates, receiving 14.9% of first preference votes, but was not elected. He ran again in the 1938 general election, this time as one of 30 Labour candidates, receiving 4,950 first preference votes (12.6%), but was once again not elected. This was to be his last general election campaign, however he would remain as an elected city councillor on Cork Corporation.\nAccording to \"A Biographical Dictionary of Cork\", by Tim Cadogan and Jeremiah Falvey, Quill served as a councillor on Cork County Council for two periods. As a Transport member, he was nominated and won a seat in 1925, retaining his seat in 1928 and lost the seat in 1934, before winning a seat again in 1942 and serving until 1945. He was elected to both the Cork County Council and the Cork Corporation that year. Quill was at one time Chair of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance. Quill also served as a city councillor with Cork Corporation. The City Councillor's 1920\u20131945 roll book seems to record that T Quill was elected in 1936. In 1939, he is listed as a member of the Labour Party's Cork Centre Branch. There was a local election in the city almost every year from 1929 to 1936 to elect portions of the city council and others in 1942 and 1945. Quill was a member of the South Cork Board of Public Health.He is still listed as a councillor in this book in 1944\u20131945. Quill served as Deputy Lord Mayor of Cork and on the Committee of Management of the South Infirmary.\nIn 1936, Quill said that \u201cthe Irish Labour Movement has its own road to travel and had no place for the cries of Fascism or Communism that plagued the world today.\u201d \nDuring the 1940s, Quill became chair of the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party. In this capacity he proved to be an enemy of Michael O'Riordan. The branch had been established by former members of the Curragh Camp's Communist Group. O'Riordan had retrospectively asserted that Quill was imposed as chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also stated that Quill had made an attack on what Quill \"called 'the Jew boys' of Cork\". It was during this time that the ITGWU had disaffiliated from the Labour Party and the National Labour Party was established on the basis that communists were infiltrating the party. A report in the \"Irish Press\" suggests that the Administrative Council \"had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch\". O'Riordan's son, Manus, would later refer to Quill as an \"anti-Semitic red-baiting villain\" who was responsible for O'Riordan's expulsion.\nDuring the 1920s, Quill established the City of Cork Co-operative Society with Con Desmond. Quill was the secretary of the City of Cork Co-operative Society and manager and secretary of the Cork Co-operative Bakery Society. This included social enterprises such as Cooperative Tea, Cooperative Cream and Cooperative Bread. He was also a member of the Cork Co-operators' Guild. He was also the editor of \"The Cork Co-Operator\", a monthly publication of the co-operative movement in Cork. In a letter to the editor, published on the cover of the June 1939 issue, Steve Denny (director of the London Co-operative Society) described \"The Cork Co-Operator\" as a \"bright little paper\". Quill frequently attended the Co-operative Congress in the UK throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Inspired by Robert Owen, he built cottages for the workers on his land. Quill regarded himself as a Christian Socialist. He resigned his position in the co-operative movement in 1954. These societies were defunct by the time of his death in 1960. In 2021, an article in \"The Southern Star\" described Quill as \"an icon in the Irish co-operative movement\".\nHe married Mary McCarthy on 7 January 1930.\nIn the 1940s, Quill lived at Ferney House in Blackrock, Cork, where he grew vegetables and kept livestock. His first trial of Holstein Friesian cattle took place here, and he owned what \"The Southern Star\" described as \"one of the largest and most successful herds in the country\". He was used as an example in an 1950s advertisement titled \"Friesian T.T Herd Makes History\", and served as the honorary secretary of the Irish Friesian Society. He served on the General Committee of the Munster Agricultural Society, wrote a farming column for \"The Cork Examiner\" and contributed to the \"The Evening Echo\" under the pen name Carrigeen.By the 1950s he had settled at a property near Blarney, left politics and was Chair of the Blarney National Farmer's Association. According to the \"Irish Independent\", Quill was the Chair of the Federation of Cow Testing Associations. He was also on the Committee of the Irish Landrace Pig Society.\nHe died on 10 June 1960, aged 59 and was buried in St. Finbarr's Cemetery.

It also produces and distributes anime films.\nEarly history.\nThe company was founded in 1895 as a kabuki production company and later began producing films in 1920. Shochiku is considered the oldest company in Japan involved in present-day film production, but Nikkatsu began earlier as a pure film studio in 1912. Founded by the brothers Takejir\u014d \u014ctani (\u5927\u8c37\u7af9\u6b21\u90ce) and Matsujir\u014d Shirai (\u767d\u4e95\u677e\u6b21\u90ce), it was named \u201cMatsutake\u201d in 1902 after the combined \"kunyomi\" reading of the \"kanji\" \"take\" (bamboo) and \"matsu\" (pine) from their names, reflecting the traditional three symbols of happiness: bamboo, pine, and plum. The \"onyomi\" reading of Sh\u014dchiku first appeared in 1920 with the founding of the film production subsidiary \"Sh\u014dchiku Kinema G\u014dmei-sha\".\nShochiku grew quickly in the early years, expanding its business to many other Japanese live theatrical styles, including \"Noh\" and \"Bunraku\", and established a near monopoly due to its ownership of theaters, as well as \"kabuki\" and \"shimpa\" drama .\nThe company began making films in 1920, about a decade after its main rival Nikkatsu. The company sought to break away from the prevailing pattern of ' and to emulate Hollywood standards. It was the first film studio to abandon the use of female impersonators and brought new ideas, including the star system and the sound stage to Japan. It built its main studio at , between Tokyo and Yokohama, and hired , a Japanese who had worked in Hollywood as an actor and cameraman to direct its first film, \"Island Woman\" (\"Shima no Onna\", 1920). It also hired the prominent theater director to head a school at the studio, which produced the film ' (1921), a film directed by which is considered \"the first landmark film in Japanese history\".\nHowever, Shochiku's early history was difficult, as audiences preferred the more action-packed \"jidai-geki\" historical swashbucklers over the melodramas, and its Kamata studios were destroyed by the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, forcing a temporary relocation to Kyoto.\nWith the reopening of its Kamata studios, Shochiku also introduced the \"shomin-geki\" genre, with stories reflecting the lives of the lower-middle urban classes. These dramas proved immensely popular, and marked the start of the careers of many prominent directors (including Ozu, Naruse, and ) and actors (including ).\nIn 1931, Shochiku released the first \u201ctalkie\u201d made in Japan: \"\" \"(Madamu to ny\u014db\u014d\", 1930). Filming became increasing difficult at the Kamata studios during the 1930s with the rapid industrialization of the surrounding area with munitions factories and metal foundries, and Shochiku decided to close the studio and relocate to Ofuna, near Kamakura in 1936. The following year, Shochiku Kinema was merged with its parent company, Shochiku Entertainment, and adopted the new name of Shochiku Corporation.\nSince WW2.\nDuring the World_War_II, Shochiku's President, Shiro Kido, helped establish the Dai Nippon Eiga Kyokai (Greater Japan Film Association), whose purpose was to coordinate the industry's efforts with Japanese government policy. From the mid-1930s until 1945, the films produced by Shochiku and other Japanese movie companies were propagandistic. After the , Kido and Shochiku's co-founder Otani were arrested and charged with Class-A war crimes by the authorities. \nIn 1953, after the end of the occupation, Kido returned to Shochiku and revived the melodramatic style of films which had been a Shochiku trademark in the pre-war era. Directors associated with Shochiku in this era included Ozu, Keisuke Kinoshita, and . Many of the films during the 1950s were aimed primarily at female audiences. In particular, 's three-part \"What is Your Name?\" (\"Kimi no na wa?\") in 1953 was the most commercially successful film of the period. Ozu's \"\", made in 1953, later earned considerable accolades, being selected in the international critics poll as the third best film of all time.\nBy the start of the 1960s, Shochiku's films were criticized as \u201cold-fashioned\u201d with the popularity of rival Nikkatsu\u2019s \"Taiyo-zoku\" youth-orientated movies. The studio responded by launching the (\"Nuberu bagu\") which also launched the career of among others, though Oshima soon went independent; the films of Oshima and other film makers were not financially successful and the company changed its policies.\nHowever, the growing threat from television led to the bankruptcy of Shochiku\u2019s competitors, Shintoho in 1961 and Daiei in 1971, whereas Nikkatsu and Toei turned to movies and soft pornography to maintain attendance. Shochiku continued to maintain its family-orientated audience largely due to the phenomenal success of the directed by Yoji Yamada from 1969 through 1997. However, with the death of its star , the series came to an end, and the company faced increasing financial difficulties. \nThe Ofuna studio was briefly transformed into a theme park, Kamakura Cinema World, but this was closed in 1998 and the site was sold off in 2000 to . Since that time, Shochiku has relied on its film studio and backlot in Kyoto. Yamada\u2019s \u201c\u201d (\"Tasogare Seibei\", 2002) was nominated for an Oscar as ."}

However, the company found itself to be outflanked by other much larger studios and appointed Mitsugu Okura as its new top executive in 1955 to guide the company toward better things. Under the guidance of Okura, Shintoho began producing such works as the critically acclaimed , , a slew of pink films, and a number of films centered around the supernatural among a handful of others.\nIn May of 1961, Shintoho declared bankruptcy and two new companies were formed to take its place. Mitsugu Okura, Shintoho's former president, created the studio after purchasing Shintoho's production facilities in Tokyo. At this time Koichi Goto, a former Shintoho employee, purchased the rights to the Shintoho name and 3 years later established Shintoho Entertainment. In 1972, this new company relocated from Osaka to Tokyo and absorbed another piece of the original Shintoho, as well as receiving a new name: \"Shintoho Eiga\". Shintoho Eiga also later went on to distribute a number of Shintoho's films and former director for Shintoho, Kiyoshi Komori, began directing pink films for Shintoho Eiga in 1964 until his retirement in the 1970s."}

It was developed in Europe and is based on the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxist dialectics say that real-world condition such as class, labor, and socioeconomic interactions are important. This is a contrast to Hegelian dialectic, which says that contradictions in material phenomena can be resolved by analyzing them and finding a solution. Marx thought that the most effective solution to the problems caused by such contradictory phenomena was to address and rearrange the systems of social organization at the root of the problems.\nDialectical materialism accepts that the natural world changes. New qualities of being will come to light with each change. As Z. A. Jordan noted, \"Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'.\"\nThe formulation of the Soviet version of dialectical and historical materialism in the 1930s by Joseph Stalin and his associates (such as in Stalin's book \"Dialectical and Historical Materialism\") became the official Soviet interpretation of Marxism."}

It was later ported to the Sega Saturn several months later with a few minor changes.\nThe game was basically a technical demo to show how the PlayStation could handle an arcade style 2D game filled with many on-screen sprites and some 3D sprite scaling. It was never released outside of Japan, and is considered to be on the rare side for both consoles, as the game was never reprinted.\nIn the not to distant future, a conglomerate known as the Big Black Corporation is up to no good, and the Hibino family venture on a journey to the Big Black Tower to rescue Rando's wife, who has been kidnappned by Mr. Herograw (the head of the company, and the main villan).\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PLAYSTATION &amp; SATURN VERSIONS:\n- The Sega Saturn version does not use translucent textures for see-through effects. This is due to the fact that the Saturn does not have built in hardware support for translucency. Instead, you see a cross hatch pattern effect that looks somewhat grainy, but does the job.\n- In the PlayStation version, it is possible to gain more health than 100%. This appears to have been removed in the Saturn game, altering the difficulty to a degree.\n- The loading times are slightly longer on the Saturn, causing a 'Now Loading' screen between scenery. However, the difference in time is only a few seconds more.\n- The soundtrack on the Sega Saturn version is slightly remixed and sounds like it was remastered on a Midi synthesizer, and it can be played back by putting the disc in an Audio CD player. The original PlayStation version appears to be played through the PlayStation's internal audio mixer, and the music does not restart when the game is paused, as is the case on the Saturn.\n- Rando's burning montage on the Sega Saturn intro shows a different diffusion effect.\n- The 3D Technosoft logo screen appears to move slightly sluggish on the Saturn port.\n- The enemy VanDamme is bald on the Saturn version.\n- In the first act of Stage 2, the Saturn version has an added scrolling layer that obscures part of the playfield view.\n- The World Start screen shows a zoomed in view of the playfield on the Saturn, as opposed to a portrait of the playfield on a coloured chessboard.\n- As expected, The bonus item PlayStation console is replaced by a Sega Saturn in the Saturn port.\nDescription.\nManufacturer's description:\nTo help the mother of kidnapped scientists, and daughter Rio Ran Tong Sun Nonoiti Father belt scrolling fighting action to challenge the evil organization Team Gloucester Harare by three research assistants mother.

It is about 130\u00a0km from Shimla and is well connected with NH 5 which passes through Theog, Narkanda and Kumarsain.\nHistory.\nThe principality of Bushahr (also known as Bashahar, Bushahar, Bashahr) was once among the largest of the twenty-eight Shimla Hill States under the administration of the British Raj keen to invest on regional and transcontinental trade and exploit Himalayan resources. Caught in one of the British imperial enterprise, it was subjected to political-cum-economic vicissitudes, acceding to the Indian Union in 1947. On 8 March 1948, along with twenty other princely hill States of Punjab and Shimla, Bashahr signed an agreement which resulted in its inclusion in the Indian State of Himachal Pradesh.\nRampur, a small township situated at 1,005 meters on the left bank of the Sutlej, served as Bushahar's winter capital. Being well connected with major trading routes that joined Indian markets with Central Asia and Tibet, it buzzed with mercantile activity, especially in November during the Lavi fair, the largest trading event in the north Himalayas attracting traders from Kashmir, Ladakh, Yarkand, and the Indian mainland. Concerning the origins of the Rampuri fair, the Census of India (1961) reports:\n\"About three hundred years ago during the regime of Raja Kehar Singh of Bushahr, a trade treaty was signed between the Bushahr State and Tibet\u2026Horses from Tibet and swords from Bushahr were exchanged in token of this friendship. It was written in the treaty that their friendly relations would continue till this time\u2026Since then, it is presumed that trade relations increased and eventually [the] Lavi fair was held.\"\nRampur was also located along pilgrimage routes to sacred sites in western Tibet shared by Hindus, B\u00f6n and Buddhists alike, i.e., Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar. Missionary and pilgrimage activities, intensified by trading possibilities, created the conditions for Tibetan Buddhism to take a firm stronghold in these borderland regions. Twenty-two kilometres from the village of Namgya in upper Kinnaur, laid the Shipki pass which linked caravan routes to and from western Tibet. This treacherous transcontinental passage must have been in use from ancient times, for among the ruined castles reported by Francke at Shipki village, there were no living memories of the origins of mKar gog, the oldest of them built above the village in cyclopean style. Rampur also has Hydro Power Stations namely, Nathpa Jhakri Power Station (1500 MW) and Rampur Hydro Power Station (412 MW) by SJVN Ltd. A second castle, known as Seng ge mkhar, is said to have received its crooked ground plan \u201cthrough a race round its base executed in opposite directions by a poisonous snake and a scorpion,\u201d and was built, in all probability, during the Ladakhi occupation of mNga\u2019 ris by orders of King Seng ge rnam rgyal (1570\u20131642) and called after him. \nGeography.\nRampur is located at . It has an average elevation of 1021\u00a0metres (4429\u00a0feet). It is a very beautiful place situated at the bank of the Satluj river. It borders on the north with Spiti, on the west with Kumarsain and Anni, on the east with Kinnaur and on the south with Rohru. The city is nearby to popular places like Jhakri, Sarahan Bushahr, Green valley Dhar Gaura and Shraikoti to name a few. The city is also the home to Asia's Largest underground Hydro Power Project - The Nathpa Jhakri Hydro Power Station built by Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (formerly known as Nathpa Jhakri Power Corporation) at Jhakri with dam sight at nathpa in Kinnaur and world's deepest Surge shaft at a Shah (22\u00a0km from Rampur).

{"id": "839196", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839196", "title": "Fortune Street (video game)", "text": "Fortune Street (known as Boom Street in Europe and Oceania) is a Wii game developed by Square Enix. It is a follow-up to the 2007 Nintendo DS game Itadaki Street DS and is the first Itadaki Street title that was released outside of Japan.\nThis game was able to be played over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection; however, the service was terminated on May 20, 2014, making this game no longer playable online. Also, mainly due to this game's Wi-Fi compatibilities, it is impossible to transfer the save data to an SD Card.\nGameplay.\nThis game functions like a Monopoly style board game. It can be played with up to four players. If game data can't be saved or won't be saved, only offline multiplayer is available (though Out to Lunch can be used to mimic a single player game. Every player can be CPU players by doing this). When playing multiplayer offline, records aren't saved. Also, when playing multiplayer offline, players can decide if each player should have their own Wii Remote, or that players share one Wii Remote. When using the latter option, players will press one of the three buttons: ,\u00a0 and\u00a0 during an Auction to make a bid, and are ordered based on where characters appear in the Auction window.\nAt the start of a game, all players use number machines to determine the turn order, with the highest number going first (note that it is possible for two numbers on the number machines to be the same, if so then the tying players use the number machines again). The only exceptions are the tutorial, where the human player always goes first; and in Custom Rules, should the Order of play be set to As picked, where it makes P1 goes first, then P2, then P3, then P4.\nFour players (excluding the play system in Tutorial mode, where only three characters play) take turns by rolling dice to go around the board and buy shops. Some squares involve special attributes, such as Take-a-break squares (when a character lands there, all of their shops will close until the player's next turn) and Venture squares (like a Chance space in Monopoly). Players also have the ability to invest money in their own shops when they land on them (a maximum of 999 per turn). Scattered around the board are four suits (Spade, Heart, Diamond, and Club); if the player collects all of them and returns to the Bank (also the starting square) they get a promotion. When a player gets a promotion, they get a fixed amount for their salary, plus a shop bonus which is based off 10% the sum of all the player's shop value, as well as a promotional bonus (extra money given to the player that increases as they level up). The player's level also goes up when they get a promotion.\nThe player wins by increasing their net worth to at least the target amount (usually determined by the game, if on Custom mode though, this can range between 6,000 and 999,000 in increments of 1,000) and returning to the bank first (in the Practice Boards, the target net worth for Easy Rules and Standard Rules are 5,000 G and 8,000 G respectively). Net worth is the total combined amount of ready cash and value in stocks and shops and can be increased by having other players land on their shops and buying multiple shops in an area or investing in stocks and owned shops to increase the stock price. If the player runs out of ready cash at any point, they must sell either stocks or a shop to try and get out of debt; any shops sold for cash are auctioned (the winning bid gets paid to the bank). Note that the bank only offers 75% of the shop price to a player if they are in debt. Also, if a player auctions a shop from \"Manage Shops\" or gets Venture Card #74, the highest bid is credited to the original owner. If the player's net worth goes below zero, then they go bankrupt; all their assets are sold off if any remain and they are automatically eliminated from the game. The player with the highest net worth automatically wins if the bankruptcy limit is met (although in a very rare case should two or more players have the same highest net worth, the player that goes later in the turn order wins). In Tour mode, the game ends once one player goes bankrupt, in Custom mode, this can be set to when two players go bankrupt or to have a last-man-standing rule.\nCharacters.\nCharacters have expansive dialogue and interact with each other\nAll 22 characters from Itadaki Street DS return, with the addition of four new characters for a grand total of 26. Players can also use and customize their Miis in the game.\nMiis are the only playable characters in single-player and online mode; in multiplayer offline, players can also choose between the Mario and Dragon Quest characters as well. Each computer character is ranked from S, A, B, C, D in terms of difficulty (S being the highest, and D being the lowest) which means each computer character has a predetermined difficulty. If the player beats either all the Easy Tour boards or all the Standard Tour boards, they will have the ability to switch the computers' difficulty from S rank to their normal rank.\nOther\nMii\nNon-Playable\nMario series\n8-bit Buzzy Beetle\n8-bit Goomba\n8-bit Koopa\n8-bit Piranha Plant\nBob-omb\nBoo\nBullet Bill\nChain Chomp\nDry Bones\nLakitu\nLuma\nNoki\nPianta\nShy Guy\nThwomp\nToads\nYoshis\nDragon Quest series\nGoodybag\nHealslime\nMagmalice\nMalroth\nMetal slime\nMottle slime\nShe-slime\nRockbomb\nOther.\nSuper Mario Bros.: The World 1-1 stage is based off the same level from this game.

It was created by Square Enix. Like other installments in the Itadaki Street series, \"Itadaki Street DS\" is a Monopoly-like game that has some Mario Party-esque elements added to it due to the appearance of several Mario characters (minigames, for example). It was released on June 21, 2007 only in Japan.\nA follow-up to this game, titled Fortune Street was released for the Wii in December 2011.\nGameplay.\nPlayers move around the board, buying shops and collecting money from others who land on their shop spaces. Depending on circumstances, some players can forcibly take over another player's shop spaces, or make them inactive for a turn. Players can also hold shares of a block of spaces so that they get paid when someone lands on any space in that block, even if it is not their own.\nPlayers get bonuses for leveling up, which is done by passing four special spaces on the board (each marked with a suit- Club, Diamond, Heart, and Spade) and then going to the Bank space. If the player lands on one of these special spaces instead of passing them, they get a chance to randomly draw a \"chance card\", which affects gameplay or a player. Usually, the goal is to reach a certain total property value and get to the Bank, or to make a player bankrupt. There is also a special \"Casino\" space where themed games of chance occur.\nCharacters.\nThere are 23 playable characters in Itadaki Street DS (if the male and female avatars are counted as one character): Eleven from the Mario series and eleven from the Dragon Quest series. Players are also able to create and customize their own characters that can be played as. Although only four of the characters from both series are playable to begin with, the others can be unlocked by playing through the Tour Mode of the game. Additionally, there are also three Support/Guest characters that players can summon with the help of a card, but are not playable.\nSupport/Guest Characters\nLakitu (shuts down spaces he passes or lands on for one turn)\nHealslime (gives marks necessary for leveling up when player passes it)\nDancing Jewels/GoodyBag (pays out to the owner of any space it lands on)\nTrivia.\nThe theme \"Hello, Happy Kingdom\" from \"\" is featured in this game's tutorial level.\nThis is one of the few games where Mario has written dialogue."}

Other times they would bribe the natives, promising to give them spices and money. The natives were forced to stay at the missions until their training was complete. As a result, many natives tried to escape. These natives were brought back to the mission, beaten, and punished. The soldiers would often beat the natives in public to show the natives what would be done if they didn't follow the rules.

It was directed by Yugo Serikawa, with the screenplay written by Takashi Iijima and Serikawa. It was released on July 21st, 1966, with a runtime of 64 minutes. It is a loose adaptation of the introductory arc, \"Birth\".\nOverview.\nThe earliest signs of the film's production can be seen in some early 1966 concept art by Ishinomori, done after discussions with the film planner Yoshifumi Hatano and the changes that the production team planned to make to the characters.\nMany aspects were to be significantly altered in the movie, some to the frustration of Ishinomori. The most notable change that had disappointed him had involved Cyborg 007 being changed to be a young nine-year old boy, in order for the film to better appeal to the child audience. However, it was a compromise that had to be made, under the logic that it was much easier to empathize with a child character. The child 007 can be seen in this concept art, and would be previewed in the January 1966 one-shot \"The Man in the High Castle\". A redesign for 001 would also be depicted there, with his bangs no longer covering his eyes.\nShortly before the film's release, as the Cyborg 009 feature moved to , Ishinomori had to draw up a new origin story for film viewers who would be reading the magazine, although it was not intended to be canon with the upcoming \"Underground Empire of Yomi\" arc. This story, \"Prologue\", was a brief origin story taking cues from some parts of this film.\nOther notable changes in the film included the removal of the biracial angle to 009, as well as him being changed from a delinquent to a race car driver captured by Black Ghost. 003 would also be depicted as a ballerina in her backstory, which would be carried forth to further incarnations.\nPlot.\nAfter a sabotage on the race track that causes the #9 car driven by the racer \"Hurricane\" Joe Shimamura to crash, an ambulance arrives on the scene to take him away. But this ambulance is in actuality a decoy sent by the Black Ghost organization, the ones responsible for the wreck, while a real ambulance arrives too late.\nIn being taken to the Black Ghost base, Joe is found to have gone into cardiac arrest, being clinically dead and necessitating the replacement of his heart, and the Black Ghost scientists set to work on remodeling the rest of his body.\nJoe awakens later on in a strange white uniform, but is quickly put through endurance tests, eventually winding up in the ocean and emerging to find the scientists congratulating him. He is introduced to eight other cyborgs of the 00 prototype line, who quickly announce their plans to rebel and bring a captive, Dr. Gilmore, along.\nJoe, now called \"009\", soon learns that Gilmore had organized this rebellion with the cyborgs and that Black Ghost made them as weapons to profit off of war. The cyborgs must fight off the Black Ghost fleet following them in the getaway plane, as 003 introduces 009 to each team member and describes their power.\nThe team land on a deserted island, but soon find their plane blown up by robotic dinosaurs and must face other threats. 009, 007, and 008 take to the sea to take one of the Black Ghost submarines hostage, and the team manage to escape to freedom- for a time.\nAt Dr. Gilmore's research center, the cyborgs attempt to get used to being on the run and living away from their home countries. 003 tells 009 of her past, in how her parents were killed in a war and how Black Ghost ruined her life further. It is found that Black Ghost still has a base that the cyborgs must destroy, and 009 opts to take only 003, 006, and 007 along with him.\nIn the area surrounding the base, 009, 006, and 007 fight off against a spider-shaped mecha, while 003 is abducted and put on an operating table to be re-programmed against the other cyborgs. As the others enter the base and fight off against the soldiers, they find the newly evil 003 waiting for them and attempting to shoot them. 009 then discovers that the true leader of Black Ghost is a brain inside a machine, and shoots at it, causing the brainwashing on 003 to be broken. But with the base set to explode, they must escape.\nOutside, as they attempt to get back to their ship, they find more Black Ghost soldiers waiting- along with the other 00 cyborgs, who have come just in time to shoot the soldiers and assist their teammates. The nine cyborgs narrowly escape the exploding island.\nIn the end, the nine stand in civilian clothing (and 003 holding 001), as for the time, they can now go back to their average lives and have peace from Black Ghost."}

They have two carbon atoms, three hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. In the ketose group, the first carbon has a double bond to an oxygen and a single bond to the other carbon.

The ceremonies and customs have changed greatly in the past 350 years. Original traditional Meitei weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern matrimonial practices of the Sanamahists and rural weddings (in Loi villages of Manipur). Notably, modern day Sanamahist matrimonial practices are in fact, the original true traditional Meitei wedding without the influence of foreign culture.\nNo matter what religion one follows, the Meiteis are not allowed to marry between the persons of the same salai (clan). Else, severe punishment or banishment from the society (colony) is the usual result in Meitei culture.\nGenerally, in urban areas, monogamy is common while in rural areas, polygamy is not rare.\nThe marriage process usually starts with the meeting between the couple's families and the consultation on the two's horoscopes. If everything is fine, the marriage day will be fixed and finally, the partners will be wedded.\nRegarding the cultural diversity of the Meitei ethnicity, there are the adherents of Sanamahism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam.\nDuring early times, there were strong religious barriers between the castes inside the Meitei ethnicity. For instance, a general Meitei (either Hindu or Sanamahist) cannot marry a person who belongs to Meitei Pangal (Manipuri Muslim) or Meitei Bishnupriya (Bishnupriya Manipuri) communities.\nTraditional Meitei practices.\nIn the traditional Meitei marriage ceremony, brides do not wear potloi. Instead, they wear phanek (traditional Meitei sarong) and Kajenglei (traditional Meitei headdress). Besides, the sacred chantings will all be done in Classical Meitei language.\nHindu practices.\nIn the Meitei Hindu marriage, brides wear potloi instead of phanek. Besides, many of the sacred chantings are performed in Sanskrit in addition to Classical Manipuri language.\nSince Hinduism among the Meitei ethnicity is actually brought from the Vaishnavism of Bengal, the Meitei Hindus somehow imitate and follow the traditional matrimonial styles of the Bengalis.\nChristian practices.\nThere is no unique way to Meitei Christian marriage ceremony. In fact, the Meitei Christians perform the same general Christian marriage ceremony.\nIslamic practices.\nThe Meitei Pangal people (Meitei Muslim people) has a unique culture which is a fusion of the traditional Meitei practices and the general Islamic practices."}

They are the Mourning Sword (or Black Sword), the Pearl Sword, the State Sword (or Sunday Sword), the Old Bailey Sword and the Mansion House Justice Room Sword. When the Lord Mayor goes outside the City of London sometimes he or she takes the Travelling Sword of State, which is different from the State Sword. They are kept at Mansion House, where the Lord Mayor of London lives.\nMourning Sword.\nThe Mourning Sword is used for funerals and things like that. It has also been known as the Black Sword and the Lenten Sword. No one is quite sure about its history. \"The Telegraph\" says some people think it is from the 16th century and that it might have been found in the River Thames. More than one sword has been used as the Mourning Sword. \nSamuel Pepys wrote about this sword in his diary on September 1663. He is writing about talking to Anthony Bateman, who was the Lord Mayor:\nWriting about that part of Pepys' diary, Henry Benjamin Wheatley says that William St John Hope says places like the City of London have had simple, black swords for this reason for a long time. He also says that the blade (sharp part) of the sword is old but the rest of it is newer.\nIn \"Ceremonial Swords of Britain: State and Civic Swords\" (2017), Edward Barrett says that the Mourning Sword they have now is from 1615 or 1623. It has a blade long and wide, and a hilt (the part you hold).\nLord Mayor Roger Gifford carried the Mourning Sword at the funeral of Margaret Thatcher in 2013. He led the Queen and Prince Philip in and out of St Paul's Cathedral. The last time it was used at a funeral before that was in 1965 for Winston Churchill. It is also used on Good Friday, feast days and the anniversary of the Great Fire of London.\nPearl Sword.\nThe Pearl Sword is supposed to have been given to the City of London Corporation by Elizabeth I of England in 1571 when the Royal Exchange was opened. There are about 2,500 pearls on the scabbard (the cover you put over a sword). That's why it is called the pearl sword. Wheatley says that Hope says it might not be from 1571, but from 1554 or 1555.\nIts blade is long and wide, and it has a hilt. It weighs without the scabbard. The first of the blade have been made blue and scratched with pictures of fruit, arrows, a ship and other things. Its scabbard is from at least as long ago as 1808.\nWhen the Queen comes to the City in State, she is met at the border between the City and Westminster, where Temple Bar used to be, by the Lord Mayor of London. He offers her the sword to touch. Before 1641, the king or queen would take the sword and keep it while they were in the City. In 1641 Charles I gave it back to the Lord Mayor instead, and that's what they still do now. This ceremony as started in 1215 when the mayor (now the Lord Mayor) started to be elected. They do something like this in other places, including York.\nWhen George III became king on 22 September 1761, they had to use the Pearl Sword because someone forgot to bring the royal Sword of State.\nLord Montbatten wrote in his diary that Queen Elizabeth was going to hit Idi Amin on the head with the pearl sword if he came to her Silver Jubilee (when she had been Queen for 25 years) in 1977. She was probably joking. It was used at her Diamond Jubilee (60 years). It was also used at her 90th official birthday.\nState Sword.\nThe State Sword is one half of the Sword and Mace. Thye are symbols of the authority of the Lord Mayor and the City of London Corporation. It is carried by the Sword Bearer. The mace is carried by the Serjeant-at-Arms. The City of London has had a Sword of State since before 1373. The first known sword-bearer of the City was John Blytone. He left the job in 1395. The current sword is from the middle of the 17th century. It is also called the Sunday Sword. It was made in about 1670.\nThe blade is long and wide. The hilt is long and it weighs without the scabbard. It used to have a blue and gold pattern on the blade but that has worn off.\nTravelling State Sword.\nBecause the State Sword is so valuable, it isn't taken outside the City of London. Instead there is a Travelling State Sword. It looks the same but it is lighter and slightly longer. It was made by Wilkinson Sword in 1962 and given to the City by Lord Mayor Sir Ralph Perring. \nIt was first taken out of the country to Canada in 1963 by Ralph Perring. He took the mace with him too.\nOld Bailey Sword.\nThe Old Bailey Sword stays at the Old Bailey, which is one of the buildings of the Crown Court in London. It is on the wall behind the most senior judge. The Cutlers' Society says it was made by Richard Mathew in 1562 or 1563 and given to the City in 1563. \nIt has a blade long and wide, and an hilt. It weighs without the scabbard. It has some decorations on the blade, like the Pearl Sword. The scabbard is covered with crimson (dark red) velvet and decorated with gold lace and decorative metal.\nMansion House Justice Room Sword.\nThe last sword is the Mansion House Justice Rom Sword. The Lord Mayor is chief magistrate of the City, so the Swordbearer's room was made into a court in 1849. That's where this sword gets its name. Its blade is long and wide. It has an hilt and weighs without the scabbard. It is from around 1830 and it might be Portuguese.\nSwords like this in other cities.\nSome other cities have swords too. Bristol, Lincoln and Exeter each have four. Thirteen other places in Britain have two swords each. So does Dublin.\nThe swords of the Lord Mayor of Bristol are:"}

Even afterwards, the Polish nobility continued to dominate Podolia while the peasants there were mostly Ukrainians. By the end of the 19th century, Ukrainian nationalism began spreading to Podolia. The towns of western Podolia failed to become large cities because they were overshadowed by Lviv. During the Russian Civil War, Poland, Ukraine, the White Russians, and the Bolsheviks all competed for Podolia. In the end, Podolia got divided between Poland, who got western Podolia, and the Soviet Union, who got eastern Podolia. This situation existed until World War II, when the Soviet Union conquered all of Podolia. Due to World War II, the Holocaust, and later emigration, the Jewish and Polish populations of Podolia significantly decreased. After the end of World War II, the Russian population in Podolia increased significantly. Even today, Podolia is one of the most agricultural and least industrialized parts of Ukraine."}

{"id": "839782", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839782", "title": "McStroke", "text": "\"McStroke\" is the 8th episode of \"Family Guy\"s 6th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on January 13, 2008. It was written by Wellesley Wild. Brian Iles is the director of the episode. The episode is about Peter Griffin having a stroke after eating too many hamburgers.\nStory.\nPeter wants to get a mustache after reading a magazine about them. He gets one and thinks that he is a better person. He walks by a restaurant and sees it burning. A firefighter sees Peter's mustache and thinks he is also a firefighter. Peter goes in the restaurant and rescues the manager, but his mustache burns off. The manager gives him a big supply of burgers. Peter is sad that his mustache burned off, so he eats many burgers to feel better. He gets a stroke that paralyzes half of his body. He gets cured at a place for stem cell research. He ties to sue the restaurant, but he loses at a trial because he does not have any evidence. \nPeter and Brian go to the restaurant's headquarters. They take a tour of the place to try to find evidence. They find a slaughterhouse with a talking cow in it. The cow talks about how the restaurant has harmed many other cows. Peter and Brian help the cow leave the headquarters while security guards run after them. The cow makes a public speech that makes the restaurant look bad.\nStewie makes a bet to Brian that he will be the most popular kid in a high school. He gets a teenage girlfriend and wins the bet. He tries to have sexual intercourse with his girlfriend, but she laughs at him for having a small penis. On the next day, Stewie gets bullied for his small penis. He gets his girlfriend arrested by telling people she is a pedophile.\nProduction.\n\"McStroke\" was written by Wellesley Wild and Brian Iles is the director of the episode. The episode was broadcast while Seth MacFarlane (creator of \"Family Guy\") was in the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike. MacFarlane worked on writing and voice acting before the strike. He did not help work on the episode after that. Ralph Garman, Max Burkholder, Lisa Wilhoit, Alex Breckenridge, Denis Martel, Ricardo Montalban, and Phil LaMarr are guest stars in the episode.\nReception.\nThe episode was watched by about 11.50 million viewers when it was first broadcast.\nAshan Haque from IGN said that the episode was \"much more entertaining\" than a regular episode of \"Family Guy\". Robert Pierson from The TV Critic thought that the jokes in the episode were \"pretty good\". Pierson said that the writing of the stories was bad, but not annoying. Brad Trechak from TV Squad said that the episode had \"really good ideas\", but thought that the writing was not good. Trechak thought that the Writers Guild of America strike made the quality of the episode worse. Genevieve Koski from \"The A.V. Club\" thought that the episode did not have much organization, but said there were some good jokes. The Parents Television Council called it the \"Worst TV Show of the Week\" because of the story with Stewie and his teenager girlfriend. Tom Eames from \"Digital Spy\" thought the episode \"made strokes funny\" and said it was \"A farce of an episode, but in a good way.\""}

This was certainly true over the last several decades. The reasons for this are uncertain and debated. Ten of the 11 US recessions between 1953 and 2020 began under Republican US Presidents.\nJob creation.\n\"Job creation\" refers to the number of net jobs added, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports on a monthly basis. \nJournalist Glenn Kessler of \"The Washington Post\" summarized the total job creation by US President. For the 13 US Presidents starting from Harry Truman, total job creation was about 70.5 million for the 7 Democratic US Presidents and 29.1 million for the 6 Republican US Presidents. The Democratic US Presidents were in office for a total of 429 months, with 164,000 jobs per month added on average, while the Republican US Presidents were in office for 475 months, with a 61,000 jobs added per month average. This monthly average rate was 2.4 times faster under Democratic US Presidents.\nFormer President Bill Clinton said in 2012 that since 1961, Democratic US Presidents produced 42 million jobs in 24 years while Republicans produced 24 million jobs in 28 years.\nEconomists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson said that, for the 1949-2012 time period, annual job growth was 2.6% for Democratic US Presidents and 1.2% for Republican US Presidents.\nGDP growth.\nGDP is a measure of both economic production and income. \"The Economist\" reported in August 2014 that real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth was about 1.8% greater under Democratic US Presidents, from Truman up to Obama's first term, which ended in January 2013. Blinder and Watson calculated the average Democratic real GDP growth rate as 4.3%, vs. 2.5% for Republicans, from President Truman's elected term up to President Obama's first term, which ended January 2013. \"CNN\" said in September 2020 that annual average GDP growth was 4.1% under Democratic US Presidents and 2.5% under Republican US Presidents.\nThe \"New York Times\" said in February 2021 that since 1933, annual average GDP growth was 4.6% under Democratic US Presidents and 2.4% under Republican US Presidents.\nUnemployment rates.\nBlinder and Watson found that the US unemployment rate fell under Democratic Presidents by an average of 0.8%, while it increased under Republican Presidents by an average of 1.1%. Journalist Andrew Soergel wrote in \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" in October 2015 that ever since John F. Kennedy's Presidency, the unemployment rate was lower at the end of every Democrat's Presidency than at the start of it whereas this is only true for Ronald Reagan among Republican US Presidents during the same time period. (Soergel's statement here is slightly wrong since the US unemployment rate was exactly the same\u2013at 7.5%\u2013at both the start and the end of Democrat Jimmy Carter's Presidency.)\nBudget deficit.\nBlinder and Watson reported that budget deficits were smaller under Democratic US Presidents, at 2.1% potential GDP versus 2.8% potential GDP for Republican US Presidents, a difference of about 0.7%. They wrote that higher budget deficits should in theory have boosted the economy more for Republicans, and therefore cannot explain the greater GDP growth under Democrats.\nStock market returns.\nStock market returns are also higher under Democratic US Presidents ever since 1945, according to both CNN and Blinder and Watson.\nRecessions.\nCNN reported in October 2020 that 10 of the last 11 recessions began under Republican US Presidents, and that \u201cEvery Republican president since Benjamin Harrison, who was in office from 1889 to 1893, had a recession start in their first term in office.\u201d NBER reports the start date of recessions; the following list includes the President in office at that time and their party:\nBlinder and Watson calculated that the US economy was in recession for 49 quarters from 1949-2013; 8 of these quarters were under Democratic US Presidents and 41 of these quarters were under Republican US Presidents.\nCommentary.\nDuring a March 2004 interview, future Republican US President Donald Trump stated: \"It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.\"\nJournalist David Leonhardt wrote in the New York Times that economists he interviewed were unsure about the causes of the better economic performance under Democratic US Presidents. However, one proposed cause was that Democratic US Presidents were, on average, more pragmatic than Republican US Presidents were. Random good luck and the condition of the US economy at the start of US Presidents' terms have also been suggested as possible causes of this due to the fact that it's easier for an economy to grow rapidly and create a lot of jobs right after a recession as opposed to after a very long period of economic growth and strong job creation.\nStatistics.\nThe table below compares various economic data for Democratic and Republican US Presidents, using the Blinder &amp; Watson data (typically Truman's elected term through Obama's first term).

It is estimated to contain 10 million tons of asphalt. It can be found in La Brea in southwest Trinidad, inside the Siparia Regional Corporation. The lake covers about 100 acres (0,405 square kilometres). The lake is 250 feet (76,2 metres) deep.\nHistory.\nThe Pitch Lake has been very interesting to explorers and scientists. It was re-discovered by Sir Walter Raleigh in his expedition there in 1595. Raleigh himself used the asphalt to caulk his ship. The native Amerindians told Raleigh where he can find the lake. The native Amerindians had their own story about where the lake came from. The story goes that the people living there were celebrating a victory over a rival tribe when they got carried away in their celebration. They then cooked and ate the sacred hummingbird which they believed possessed the souls of their ancestors. According to legend, their winged God punished them by opening the earth and calling the pitch lake to swallow the entire village. So, the lake became a reminder of their sins. The local villages believe this legend because found many Amerindian artifacts and a skull that have been discovered and preserved, in the pitch.\nIn 1887, Amzi Barber, an American businessman known as \"The Asphalt King\", got a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake for his company, Barber Asphalt Paving Co. It was from the Pitch Lake that many of the first asphalt roads of New York City, Washington D.C., and other Eastern U.S. cities were paved."}

Users operate on their own local copies. Their changes are then pushed to the rest of the users. When a user receives the changes pushed from another user, they typically transform the changes before executing them.\nBasics.\n The idea of operational transformation is to transform (or adjust) the variables of an editing operation according to the effects of previously executed operations so that the transformed operation can achieve the correct effect and maintain document consistency.\nOperational transformation can be shown by using the example of a text editing scenario. Given a text document with a string \"abc\" replicated at two collaborating sites; and two concurrent operations:\ngenerated by two users at sites one and two, suppose the two operations are executed in the order of O1 and O2 (at site one). After executing O1, the document becomes \"xabc\". To execute O2 after O1, O2 must be transformed against O1 to become: O2' = Delete[3, \"c\"], whose position variable is incremented by one due to the insertion of one character \"x\" by O1. Executing O2' on \"xabc\" deletes the correct character \"c\" and the document becomes \"xab\". However, if O2 is executed without transformation, it incorrectly deletes character \"b\" rather than \"c\"."}
