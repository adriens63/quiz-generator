The second named storm and first hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Barry originated as a mesoscale convective vortex over the Midwestern United States on July 4. The system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July 10 and was classified as a potential tropical cyclone later that day. The system developed into a tropical storm on the next day, becoming the second named storm of the season. On July 13, Barry attained maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 991 millibars (29.3 inHg), becoming the first hurricane of the season. Later that day, Barry made landfall on Marsh Island and Intracoastal City, Louisiana both times as a Category 1 hurricane, subsequently weakening to tropical storm status. Late on July 15, Barry degenerated into a remnant low over northern Arkansas, before dissipating on July 19.\nStorm history.\nThe storm originated from a low pressure area inside the Midwestern USA. It tracked south, and became a broad area of low pressure which the National Hurricane Center assessed a high chance that the low could become a tropical cyclone.\nA day later, on July 10, the broad low-pressure system emerged from the Florida Panhandle into Apalachee Bay in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, attended by widespread showers and thunderstorms; concurrently, the NHC forecasted a high likelihood of tropical cyclone development within two days, noting a favorable environment and widespread convection, or thunderstorms, associated with the low.\nBy the morning of July 13, the thunderstorms moved closer to the center of circulation, as upper-level outflow expanded in all directions. The NHC estimated that Barry attained Category 1 hurricane status by 12:00 UTC that day, concluding that Barry was producing a small area of hurricane-force winds based on observations from the Hurricane Hunters, Doppler radar wind estimates of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), and recorded sustained winds of 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) at Eugene Island oil field. Simultaneously, the storm reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 991 millibars (29.3 inHg). At 18:00 UTC that day, Barry made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Intracoastal City, Louisiana, before weakening to tropical storm status. This made Barry the fourth tropical cyclone recorded making landfall as a hurricane on Louisiana in the month of July.\nOn July 15, the system became a low-pressure area, eventually becoming an extratropical system that brought heavy rain the Southern Ontario.\nImpact.\nOn Florida, multiple beaches were closed prior to the formation of Barry. However, some swimmers ignored the warnings and a 67 year-old man was reported to be dead. In addition, there were strong winds and thunderstorms from the disturbance that would later become Barry in the Gulf of Mexico.\nTropical Storm Barry dropped locally heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at 23.43 in (595\u00a0mm) near Ragley, Louisiana. Waterspouts were reported on Lake Pontchartrain. One tornado struck the Gentilly neighborhood in New Orleans, damaging two homes. A tide station in Amereda Pass recorded a storm surge of nearly 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m). On the southern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, storm surge exceeded 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m), while its northern shores expected tides 3 to 5\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.52\u00a0m) above normal. Flooding also occurred on the banks of the Atchafalaya River in Morgan City, Louisiana. The Lower Dularge East Levee in Terrebonne Parish was overtopped, prompting a mandatory evacuation for nearby areas. On the afternoon of July 12, Louisiana Highway 1 south of Golden Meadow\u2014the only thoroughfare leading out of Grand Isle and Port Fourchon\u2014was closed after seawater began to inundate portions of the road.\nAs Barry moved ashore the Louisiana coast on July 13, Entergy and Cleco, the two major electricity companies in southern Louisiana, reported the loss of power to over 114,000 customers. Power lines knocked down by fallen trees in the Metairie area cut power to 5,140 electricity customers in the New Orleans metropolitan area. The most widespread power outages occurred where wind speeds were highest in Lafourche Parish and Terrebonne Parish, as well as eastern Baton Rouge; over 39,000 lost power in these areas. All electricity customers in Grand Isle lost power, and a total of 4,300 customers were affected by power outages as Barry's initial rainbands swept across coastal Louisiana.\nIn Southern Ontario, many highways were blocked and several cars were submerged. Unusually, the storm produced a funnel cloud in Oro-Medonte, Southern Ontario.\nIn Arkansas, the highest rainfall total of was recorded. A police station was flooded and a highway was closed. Also, 20 people and more than 70 animals were rescued from floodwaters. No one died in the state.\nThe total damage caused by Barry is about $600 million."}
{"id": "704996", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=704996", "title": "Holland's schema theorem", "text": "Holland's schema theorem, also called the fundamental theorem of genetic algorithms, is a theorem regarding genetic algorithms. It says that individuals with a fitness that is higher than average are more likely to prevail. John Holland proposed the theorem in the 1970s. At the start, it was used as the foundation for explanations of the power of genetic algorithms. This interpreation has been criticized in several publications, where the Schema Theorem is shown to be a special case of the Price equation with the schema indicator function as the macroscopic measurement. \nA schema is a template that identifies a subset of strings with similarities at certain string positions. Schemata are a special case of cylinder sets, and hence form a topological space.\nDescription.\nConsider binary strings of length 6. The schema codice_1 describes the set of all strings of length 6 with 1's at positions 1, 3 and 6 and a 0 at position 4. The * is a wildcard symbol, which means that positions 2 and 5 can have a value of either 1 or 0. The \"order of a schema\" formula_1 is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template, while the \"defining length\" formula_2 is the distance between the first and last specific positions. The order of codice_1 is 4 and its defining length is 5. The \"fitness of a schema\" is the average fitness of all strings matching the schema. The fitness of a string is a measure of the value of the encoded problem solution, as computed by a problem-specific evaluation function. Using the established methods and genetic operators of genetic algorithms, the schema theorem states that short, low-order schemata with above-average fitness increase exponentially in successive generations. Expressed as an equation:\nHere formula_4 is the number of strings belonging to schema formula_5 at generation formula_6, formula_7 is the \"observed\" average fitness of schema formula_5 and formula_9 is the \"observed\" average fitness at generation formula_6. The probability of disruption formula_11 is the probability that crossover or mutation will destroy the schema formula_5. It can be expressed as:\nwhere formula_1 is the order of the schema, formula_15 is the length of the code, formula_16 is the probability of mutation and formula_17 is the probability of crossover. So a schema with a shorter defining length formula_2 is less likely to be disrupted.An often misunderstood point is why the Schema Theorem is an \"inequality\" rather than an equality. The answer is in fact simple: the Theorem neglects the small, yet non-zero, probability that a string belonging to the schema formula_5 will be created \"from scratch\" by mutation of a single string (or recombination of two strings) that did \"not\" belong to formula_5 in the previous generation.\nLimitation.\nThe schema theorem holds under the assumption of a genetic algorithm that maintains an infinitely large population, but does not always carry over to (finite) practice: due to sampling error in the initial population, genetic algorithms may converge on schemata that have no selective advantage. This happens in particular in multimodal optimization, where a function can have multiple peaks: the population may drift to prefer one of the peaks, ignoring the others.\nThe reason that the Schema Theorem cannot explain the power of genetic algorithms is that it holds for all problem instances, and cannot distinguish between problems in which genetic algorithms perform poorly, and problems for which genetic algorithms perform well."}

They were led by the Communist Party of China and Deng Xiaoping and started in December 1978. They were also called \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\".\nWhy reform?\nBefore the eighteenth century, China had one of the world's largest and most advanced economies. Adam Smith agreed. However, Chinese economy began to slow down and even got worse by the 20th century. This was due to things like the First Sino-Japanese War and Second Sino-Japanese War.\nHow did they reform?\nThe Communist Party began to fix the economy. It introduced market principles in 1978.\nPart 1: In the 70s and 80s, they stopped requiring everybody to farm and stopped sending young people to the countryside. They also opened China to foreign investment, allowing people to start businesses. However, most businesses remained owned by the government.\nPart 2: In the 80s and 90s, the PRC allowed much more private control of business (less government control, privatization). They removed price controls, protectionist policies, and regulations. Still state monopolies in banking and petroleum remained.\nWhat happened next?\nThe private sector grew remarkably, becoming 70% of China's gross domestic product by 2005. From 1978 until 2013, unprecedented growth happened, with the economy increasing by 9.5% each year.\nAfter 2005, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao controlled the economy more heavily, reversing some reforms. Xi Jinping undid some more reforms by allowing the government greater control in some areas of the economy.\nChinese society changed a lot because of these reforms. They greatly reduced poverty and increased average income. They have also led to China's rise as a world power."}

Known members of the language family are Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages (Okinawan, Kunigami, Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni).\nAll Japonic languages are agglutinative languages with a simple syllable structure and SOV word order. They have many similar features, but they are not mutually intelligible, which means native speakers of one language will not understand the other language without already knowing it.\nWhile Japanese is the ninth most spoken language in the world, the Ryukyuan languages are critically endangered, which means there are very few speakers left. This was largely because of the Japanese government's assimilation of Ryukyu into the mainland Japanese culture. During the Meiji Era, the Japanese government called the Ryukyuan languages \u201cdialects of Japanese\u201d. This was used to forbid Ryukyuans from speaking the Ryukyuan languages and to force them to speak Japanese. In fact, Okinawan soldiers and civilians were put to death for speaking Okinawan during World War II. The Japanese military would accuse them of being spies so they could have an excuse to put them to death.\nAll of the languages write using a combination of Chinese characters, called kanji in Japanese, and kana, a Japanese-made syllabic writing system made for writing phonetically. This was true even before the Japanese takeover of the Ryukyu Kingdom."}

Parts of Southern Russia around the Black sea were settled by Greeks and Romans until about the 3rd century. Huns and Turkic tribes invaded the regions around the Black sea until the 10th century. Eastern Slavs then immigrated to the region. Vikings created the Kievan Rus. In the 13th century, Mongols conquered the region and created the Golden Horde. The Mongols ruled until the 15th century. The tsardom of Russia and Russian empire were then created. Poland-Lithuania invaded Moscow, but Russia eventually drove them out. Russia expanded more west and east into Siberia. Napoleon tried to invade Russia during the winter but failed. Russia fought against Germany in WW1. In 1917, the October Revolution happened, and the communists led by Lenin created the Soviet Union. In WW2, Hitler also failed to invade Russia. Russia occupied East Germany, Poland, and most of East Europe during the Cold War. It became a big rival of the United States. In the 1990s, the Union ended, with things like the Yugoslavia revolution, and became modern Russia. In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea from the Ukraine and faced sanctions from US and others because of it.\nGreece and Rome (before 3 c).\nIn the 8th century BCE, Greek merchants migrated to Tanais and Phanagoria. The Bosporan Kingdom (a Greek kingdom) became part of the Roman Empire. In the 2nd century AD Germanic Goths migrated to the Black Sea. In the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, the Gothic Oium existed in Southern Russia until it was conquered by Huns.\nHun and Turkic colonization (3 c - 10 c).\nBetween the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the Bosporan Kingdom was also invaded by Eastern nomads like the Huns and Turkish Avars.\nA Turkic people, the Khazars, conquered the lower Volga basin steppes between the Caspian and Black Seas up to the 8th century. They were known for their laws, tolerance, and cosmopolitanism. The Khazars traded with the Baltic and the Muslim Abbasid empire centered in Baghdad. They were important allies of the Byzantine Empire, and helped win wars against Arab Caliphates. In the 8th century, the Khazars became Jewish.\nEastern Slavs (7 c - 13 c).\nSome of the ancestors of the modern Russians were the Slavic tribes. They came from the forests of the Pripet Marshes. The Early East Slavs gradually settled Western Russia by moving from Kiev towards present-day Suzdal and Murom and then from Polotsk towards Novgorod and Rostov.\nFrom the 7th century onwards, East Slavs were the majority of Western Russia. They mixed slowly and peacefully with the native Finno-Ugric tribes, such as the Merya, the Muromians, and the Meshchera.\nThe Cyrillic alphabet, invented in modern Bulgaria in the 9th century, also spread during this period.\nKievan Rus' (882\u20131283).\nVikings or Varangians did piracy and trade throughout Northern Europe. In the mid-9th century, they conquered the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas. A Varangian named Rurik became ruler of Novgorod in about 860, before they moved south and conquered Kiev, which had been previously belonged to the Turkic Khazars. Rurik's son Igor and Igor's son Sviatoslav then conquered the East Slavic tribes, destroyed the Khazar khaganate, and fought wars against Byzantium and Persia.\nThus, Rus' was born in the 9th century along the Dnieper River valley. The Kievan Rus' controlled the trade for furs, wax, and slaves between Scandinavia and the Byzantine Empire along the Volkhov and Dnieper Rivers.\nNear the 11th century, the Norse ruling class mixed with the Eastern Slavs. The Slavs absorbed Greek Christian influences when trying to loot Constantinople. Svyatoslav I claimed victory in one such campaign; he also defeated the Khazars on the Volga. The Byzantine Empire was declining but would influence Russia culturally.\nFor example through the Byzantine, the Kievan Rus' introduced the Slavic variant of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity. They became Christian in 988.\nThen Yaroslav the Wise wrote some laws.. It had name \u201cThe Russian true\u201d.\nBy the 11th century, Yaroslav the Wise helped improve the economy and literature. The Russian language was not that influenced by Greek and Latin. Church Slavonic was used directly in liturgy instead.\nA nomadic Turkic people, the Kipchaks (or Cumans), replaced earlier Pechenegs in the south steppe at the end of the 11th century. They founded a nomadic state along the Black Sea (Desht-e-Kipchak). The Kipchaks and Kievs fought.\nMongol colonization (13 c - 15 c).\nThe Rus were conquered by the Mongol Golden Horde in the 13th century. Kiev was destroyed. Halych-Volhynia would eventually be absorbed into the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, while the Mongol-dominated Vladimir-Suzdal and independent Novgorod Republic became the basis for modern Russia.\nIn 1223, the disunited southern princes faced a Mongol raiding party at the Kalka River and were soundly defeated. In 1237\u20131238 the Mongols burnt down the city of Vladimir (4 February 1238) and other major cities of northeast Russia, defeated the Russians at the Sit' River, and then moved west to conquer Poland and Hungary. By then they had conquered most of Russia.\nThe Mongols destroyed the cities. Some like Kiev and Vladimir never recovered. The new cities of Moscow, Tver and Nizhny Novgorod began to compete for hegemony in the Mongol-dominated Russia. The Golden Horde was established in the 14th century. Mongol domination of the Russia, along with demands of tribute from Russian princes, continued until about 1480.\nRusso-Tatar relations.\nAfter the fall of the Turkic Khazars in the 10th century, the Volga were conquered by the Volga Bulgaria, part of Greater Bulgaria. In the 10th century the Turks converted to Islam and traded with the Middle East and Central Asia. After the Mongol invasions of the 1230s, Volga Bulgaria was annexed by the Golden Horde. Its population evolved into the modern Chuvashes and Kazan Tatars.\nThe Mongols controlled Russia and Volga Bulgaria from their western capital at Sarai, one of the largest cities of the medieval world. Russian princes had to pay tribute to the Mongols of the Golden Horde, commonly called Tatars. The Russian Orthodox Church even experienced a revival under the Metropolitan Alexis and Sergius of Radonezh.\nThe Mongols influenced Russian military tactics and transportation. Under Mongol occupation, Russia developed its postal road network, census, fiscal system, and military organization.\nGrand Duchy of Moscow (1283\u20131547).\nDaniil Aleksandrovich founded Moscow (Muscovy). They were first a vassal to the Mongols and Tatars.\nThe Mongol rulers gave them the title of Grand Prince of Moscow and made them collect tribute from the Russian principalities. Moscow became the center of the Russian Orthodox Church.\nIvan III, the Great.\nIn the 15th century, the princes of Moscow continued to consolidate Russian land to increase their population and wealth. The most successful one was Ivan III, who laid the foundations for the Russian nation. Ivan competed with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for control over the upper Dnieper and Oka River basins.\nIvan III was able to annex Novgorod and Tver. As a result, the Grand Duchy of Moscow tripled in size.\nIvan then overthrew the ruling Tatars and Golden Horde, now divided into several Khanates and hordes. Ivan wanted to protect the southern borders from the Crimean Tatars and other Turko-Mongol armies. He built Great Abatis Belt, gave land to nobles in exchange for military service. This expanded the army.\nEventually Ivan IV became the first Russian ruler to call theirself tsar.\nIvan III tripled the territory of his state, ended the dominance of the Golden Horde over the Rus', revived the Moscow Kremlin. But he was also anti-Catholic and isolated Russia from western civilization.\nTimurid empire (14 c).\nIn the 14th century, Timur conquered parts of Southern Russia and occupied Moscow for some time.\nTsardom of Russia (1547\u20131721).\nIvan IV the Terrible.\n\"Ivan the Terrible\" increased the powers of the tsar. He got rid of many people he did not like for the smallest things. But he helped develop Russia and adapt new laws and decreased the influence of the church.\nIvan annexed the Khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and Siberia. Russia now had Muslim Tatar populations and became a multiethnic and multiconfessional state. The Stroganov family also controlled the Urals and hired Russian Cossacks to colonize Siberia.\nIvan divided Russia and created the \"oprichnina.\" There Ivan killed nobles in the Massacre of Novgorod in 1570. Military losses, disease, and lack of food weakened Russia. The Crimean Tatars were able to loot central Russian and burn down Moscow in 1571. In 1572 Ivan stopped.\nAt the end of Ivan IV's rule the Polish\u2013Lithuanian and Swedish armies invaded northwestern Russia.\nTime of Troubles.\nThere then were many civil wars and foreign invasions known as the \"Time of Troubles\" (1606\u201313). Extremely cold summers (1601\u20131603) destroyed crops, which led to the Russian famine of 1601\u20131603 and increased the chaos.\nDuring the Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u20131618), Polish\u2013Lithuanian forces invaded Moscow and appointed puppet rulers.\nBut Russia finally took back Moscow on .\nRomanov dynasty.\nIn February 1613, Michael Romanov was elected as ruler. The Romanov dynasty ruled Russia until 1917.\nRussian Empire (1721\u20131917).\nRussia expanded a lot during the 17th century, including the first Russian colonization of the Pacific in the mid-17th century, the Russo-Polish War (1654\u201367), and the Russian conquest of Siberia. Russia gained most of its territory from Siberia.\nRussian revolution, the intervention and the Civil war (1917\u20131922).\nThe Tsarist system was completely overthrown in February 1917 in the February Revolution.\nState Duma deputy took the power and organized Provisional government. First prince Lvov was its head. He lost popularity and Alexander Kerensky became it."}

They wanted to govern themselves. It happened at the same time as the Xinhai Revolution. \nOuter Mongolia is now the modern country of Mongolia. It is different from Inner Mongolia, which is in China.\nWhy did it happen?\nMongolia used to be part of the Qing dynasty. But by the 20th century Mongolia was poor. Because of the Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864) many other people were poor. The Qing was running out of money. \nThe Qing also moved many of the Mongols' animals to the rest of China to feed others. This made Mongols upset.\nManchus people created the Qing dynasty. They were not Han Chinese. But they eventually became Chinese themselves. They failed to keep the Manchus \"pure\". Still they tried to separate Han from Manchus and Mongols. For example, Han could not enter Mongolia, and Mongols could not leave Mongolia. Mongols were not allowed to speak Chinese. \nIn 1895, the Qing lost the First Sino-Japanese War. The Qing was declining.\nThe Boxer Rebellion and Japan's victory over Russia in 1905 made the Chinese hopeful that they could make things better. So they created new reforms called the Xinzheng or \"New Policies\" (\u65b0\u653f).\nOne of the goals of Xinzheng was to move more Han Chinese into Outer Mongolia (cultural assimilation). This was to tell Russians to stay away from Mongolia as it still belonged to China. The Qing thought of this as a \"shield\".\nBetween 1901 and 1910, the Qing passed laws allowing: Han Chinese to settle Chinese Mongolia, intermarriage between Han and Mongol Chinese, Mongols to speak Chinese.\nIn 1910 the Qing government made Sando the ruler of Mongolia in Ulaanbaatar. Plans were made to send Han farmers to Mongolia. In January 1911 the army was organized. Half of the army was Mongol. The Mongolians did not like this. They did not like the tax. They were \"penniless\". They did not want farmers and still wanted to be nomads and horseback riders.\nFirst revolt.\nPrince T\u00f6gs-Ochiryn Namnans\u00fcren convinced the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu to support independence. He and another leader Qin Wang (Mijiddorjiin Khanddorj) then asked Russia to help. \nSt. Petersburg heard the message. Russia wanted some distance from Japan and wanted Outer Mongolia to be a buffer state. So Russia sent some troops.\nIn 1911, the Qing government was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution. While the rest of China was busy with this problem, the Mongols saw this as the perfect opportunity to secede from the union. In 30 Novmber 1911 Mongol and Russian soldiers surrounded Kulun (Ulanbatar).\nOn December 5, Khanddorj declared independence. In January 1912 the Governor of Uliastai in western Mongolia escaped protected by Russian Cossack troops. But the governor of Khovd decided to resist, hoping for support from Xinjiang. However they were defeated. In August 1912, Khovd left the country protected by the Coassacks.\nOuter Mongolia then wanted Inner Mongolia (Pan-Mongolism). Some riots did happen in Inner Mongolia. And for some time, Outer Mongolia had parts of western Inner Mongolia. But then the new Beijing government also began to fight in Inner Mongolia. Outer Mongolia began to lose supplies. And Russia did not want to support the Outer Mongols or fight another war. So China kept Inner Mongolia. The year-long war was not good for Inner Mongolia. It is known as Year of the Ox rebellion (\"\u725b\u5e74\u4e4b\u4e71\" \u04ae\u0445\u044d\u0440 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0439\u043d \u04af\u0439\u043c\u044d\u044d\u043d).\nOn 1912 November 3, Russia signed a deal \u300a\u4fc4\u8499\u534f\u7ea6\u300bwith Mongolia to mine in Mongolia in exchange for saying Mongolia is autonomous. China was not happy. So in 1913 September 18, Sun Baoqi () signed a new agreement between China and Russia\u300a\u4e2d\u4fc4\u58f0\u660e\u6587\u4ef6\u300b. China agrees not to put troops in Mongolia and recognize the Russian-Mongol deal \u300a\u4fc4\u8499\u534f\u7ea6\u300b. In return, Russia recognizes that China has suzerainty over Mongolia. So China's power over Mongolia changed from sovereignty to suzerainty."}

He lived during the Yuan Dynasty (1271\u20131368). He is considered one of the greatest scientists in Chinese history. Guo was a major influence in the development of science.\nHe improved the Grand Canal, built a human-made lake (Kunming lake), created one of the most accurate calendars in history, invented some of the most accurate clocks during his time, and made many other contributions to math, astronomy, and hydraulics (water engineering).\nAs a kid.\nHe was born in 1231 in Xingtai, Hebei province. His family was poor. He grandfather, Guo Yong, was famous for his study of the Five Classics to astronomy, mathematics, and hydraulics. Guo Shoujing was a child prodigy. As a teenager, he learned how to build a water clock. He then improved it. His new invention was called the lotus clepsydra (a bowl shaped like a lotus flower that water dripped into). At 16 he began to study math and from there hydraulics and astronomy.\nHydraulics.\nAt 20, Guo became a hydraulic engineer and government official. He helped fix a bridge over the Dahuoquan River.\nImproving the Grand Canal.\nIn the late 1250s, Kublai Khan (of the Mongol Empire, Yuan dynasty) thought hydraulic engineering, irrigation, and water transport would help the country and people. He sent Liu Bingzhong and his student Guo to improve irrigation systems between Dadu (now Beijing) and the Yellow River. \nGuo helped build a 30\u00a0km canal from Baifu spring in the Shenshan Mountain to Dadu, \nThe Grand Canal linked the Yangzi river, the Huai, and Yellow river since the early 7th century. Guo helped extend it to Dadu 1292\u201393. \nIt worked. Kublai Khan was happy, and Guo did similar things for the rest of the empire. He was promoted to chief advisor of hydraulics, mathematics, and astronomy.\nHuman-made Kunming lake.\nHe created a human-made Kunming Lake in Beijing. This was one of his most memorable engineering feats.\nThe lake provided water for all areas surrounding Beijing and led to the best grain transport system in the world. \nHe built other reservoirs, thereby allowing people in inner China to access to fresh water for planting, drinking, and trading. \nFor irrigation, he provided hydraulics systems which distributed water equally and quickly, which allowed communities to trade more effectively, and therefore prosper. \nIn 1292, he became the head of the Water Works Bureau. \nInventions: clocks.\nGuo invented many astronomy devices: the gnomon, the square table, the armilla, and a water powered armillary sphere called the Ling Long Yi. \nAstronomy: calendar.\nEven when young Guo was revolutionizing old inventions. His clocks, watches, irrigation, reservoirs, and equilibrium stations were the most accurate of his time, allowing for an extremely accurate recording of time.\nKublai Khan noticed Guo was a genius in astronomy. So he asked Guo, Zhang, and Wang Xun to build a very accurate calendar. It would be the most accurate of its time. They built 27 observatories in the empire to collect data for calculations. \nIn 1280, Guo finished the calendar, calculating a year to be 365.2425 days, just 26 seconds off modern measurements. He invented many tools in the process.\nThe calendar revolutionized China and the world. It allowed more accurate recording of history, gave a sense of unification, and helped later emperors rule over China. His calendar would be used for the next 363 years, the longest a Chinese calendar has been used in history.\nGuo was also able to more accurately establish the location of celestial bodies and the angles of the Sun relative to Earth. He invented a new type of compass, helping people find north using the stars instead of magnets.\nIn 1283, Guo was promoted to director of the Observatory in Beijing. \nMath.\nGuo\u2019s work in mathematics was regarded as the most knowledgeable for 400 years. Throughout his life he worked a lot on spherical trigonometry, using a system of approximation to find arc lengths and angles. He approximated pi was equal to 3. But this allowed him to solve some equations much faster and more accurately than if he said pi was 3.14...\nHe also used mathematical functions for spherical trigonometry, building upon the knowledge of Shen Kuo's (1031\u20131095). \nThe next important work in trigonometry would only be printed 300 years later by Xu Guangqi in 1607, during the Ming Dynasty.\nInfluence.\nTang Shunzhi \u5510\u9806\u4e4b (1507-1560) said Guo's work was an example of \"practical scholarship\" (applying advanced knowledge to solve practical problems). \nGuo influenced the Changzhou School of Thought and spread of \"evidential learning\" (learning through experience). \nA number of things are named after Guo, including the Asteroid 2012 Guo Shou-Jing and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope near Beijing."}

{"id": "705243", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=705243", "title": "Slavery in the United States", "text": "Slavery in the United States was the legal institution of human slavery in the United States. Slaves were mostly Africans and African Americans. Slavery existed in the United States of America in the 18th and 19th centuries. Slavery existed in British America from early colonial days. Slavery was legal in all Thirteen Colonies at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It lasted in about half the states until 1865. This was when it was banned in the entire country by the Thirteenth Amendment.\nBy the time of the American Revolution (1775\u20131783), slaves had been institutionalized as a racial caste. The caste associated with African ancestry. When the United States Constitution was ratified in 1789, a small number of free people of color were able to vote. This was because they were men who owned property. During and shortly after the Revolutionary War, abolitionist laws were passed in most Northern states, and there was a movement created to end slavery. Slave states tried to extend slavery into new Western territories. They wanted to do this to keep their share of political power in the country. Southern leaders also wanted to annex Cuba as a slave territory. The United States became split over the issue of slavery. It was split into slave and free states. The Mason\u2013Dixon line divided the country. The line divided (free) Pennsylvania from (slave) Maryland.\nWhile Jefferson was president, Congress prohibited the importation of slaves, effective 1808. Although smuggling (illegal importing) through Spanish Florida was common. Slave trading within the United States, however, continued at a fast pace. This was because there was a need for labor due to the creation of cotton plantations in the Deep South. New communities of African-American culture were created in the Deep South. There were 4 million slaves in the Deep South before they were set free.\nColonial America.\nThe first Africans came to the New World with Christopher Columbus in 1492. An African crew member named Juan Las Canaries was on Columbus's ship. Shortly after, the first enslavement happened in what would later be the United States. In 1508, Ponce de Leon created the first settlement near present-day San Juan. He started enslaving the indigenous Tainos. In 1513, to supplement the decreasing number of Tainos people, the first African slaves were imported to Puerto Rico.\nThe first African slaves in the continental United States came via Santo Domingo to the San Miguel de Gualdape colony (most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present-day South Carolina). It was created by Spanish explorer Lucas V\u00e1zquez de Ayll\u00f3n in 1526.\nThe colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership. During the fight, the slaves revolted, and they ran away from the colony to hide among local Native Americans. De Ayll\u00f3n and many of the colonists died shortly after from a sickness. The colony was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who didn't run away went back to Haiti, from where they came.\nOn August 28, 1565, St. Augustine, Florida was created by the Spanish conquistador Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles. He brought three African slaves with him. During the 16th and 17th centuries, St. Augustine was the where a lot of the slave trade in Spanish colonial Florida happened. It was the first permanent settlement in the continental United States to have African slaves.\n60 years later, in the early years of the Chesapeake Bay settlements, colonial officials found it difficult to convince people to come and work for them. This was because the weather and environment of the settlements was very harsh. There was a very high chance that people would die. Most people came from Great Britain as indentured laborers. They signed contracts that said they would pay with work for their transportation, their upkeep, and their training, usually on a farm. The colonies had agricultural economies. These people were often young people who wanted to become permanent residents. In some cases, convicted criminals were sent to the colonies as indentured laborers, rather than being sent to prison. These people were not slaves, but they were required to work for four to seven years in Virginia to pay for the cost of their transportation and maintenance. Many Germans, Scots-Irish, and Irish came to the colonies in the 18th century, settling in the backcountry of Pennsylvania and further south.\nThe first 19 or so Africans to reach the English colonies arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. They were brought by English privateers who had seized them from a captured Portuguese slave ship. Slaves were usually baptized in Africa before sending them. As English custom then considered baptized Christians exempt from slavery, colonists treated these Africans as indentured servants. The African indentured servants joined about 1,000 English indentured servants already in the colony. The Africans were freed after a period of time. They were also given the use of land and supplies by their former masters. \nThere were no laws about slavery in Virginia's early history. However, in 1640, a Virginia court sentenced John Punch, an African, to slavery. This was because he tried to run away from his service. He ran away with two white people. The two white people were sentenced only to one more year of their indenture, and three years' service to the colony. This is the first legal sanctioning of slavery in the English colonies. It was one of the first legal distinctions made between Europeans and Africans.\nIn 1641, Massachusetts became the first colony to allow slavery through law. Massachusetts passed the Body of Liberties. It banned slavery in many cases, but it allowed slaves to be held if they were prisoners of war, if they sold themselves into slavery or were bought somewhere else, or if they were sentenced to slavery as punishment by the government. The Body of Liberties used the word \"strangers\" to refer to people bought and sold as slaves; they were generally not English subjects. Colonists believed this term referred to Native Americans and Africans.\nDuring most of the British colonial period, slavery existed in all the colonies. Slaves in the North usually worked as house servants, artisans, laborers, and craftsmen. Most were in cities. Many men worked on the docks and in shipping. In 1703, more than 42 percent of New York City households had slaves. New York City had the second-highest proportion of slaves of any city in the colonies after Charleston, South Carolina. Slaves were also used as agricultural workers in farming communities. This included areas of upstate New York and Long Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey. By 1770 there were 397,924 Blacks in a population of 2,170 million. They were not spread out evenly. There were 14,867 in New England where they were 2.7% of the population; 34,679 in the mid-Atlantic colonies where they were 6% of the population (19,000 were in New York or 11%); and 347,378 in the five southern colonies where they were 31% of the population.\nThe South developed an agricultural economy. It relied on commodity crops. Its planters quickly got more slaves. This was because its commodity crops were labor-intensive.\nRevolutionary Era.\nWhile there were some African slaves that were kept and sold in England, slavery in Great Britain had not been allowed by statute there. In 1772, it was made unenforceable at common law in England and Wales by a legal decision. The big British role in the international slave trade continued until 1807. Slavery continued in most of Britain's colonies. Many rich slave owners lived in England and had a lot of power.\nIn early 1775 Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia, wrote to Lord Dartmouth. He wrote he was going to free slaves owned by Patriots in case they rebelled. On November 7, 1775, Lord Dunmore issued Lord Dunmore's Proclamation which declared martial law. He promised freedom for any slaves of American patriots who would leave their masters and join the royal forces. Slaves owned by Loyalist masters, however, were not going to be freed by Dunmore's Proclamation. About 1500 slaves owned by Patriots ran away and joined Dunmore's forces. Most died of disease before they could do any fighting. Three hundred of these freed slaves made it to freedom in Britain.\nMany slaves used the war to run away from their plantations. They would run into cities or woods. In South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the total enslaved population) ran away, migrated, or died during the war. In the South, many slaves died, with many due to escapes. Slaves also escaped throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic, joining the British who had occupied New York.\nSlaves and free blacks also fought with the rebels during the Revolutionary War. Washington allowed slaves to be freed who fought with the American Continental Army. Rhode Island started enlisting slaves in 1778. Rhode Island promised money to owners whose slaves enlisted and lived to gain freedom. During the course of the war, about one fifth of the northern army was black. In 1781, Baron Closen, a German officer in the French Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment at the Battle of Yorktown, estimated the American army to be about one-quarter black. These men included both former slaves and free blacks.\nIn the 18th century, Britain became the world's biggest slave trader. Starting in 1777, the Patriots made importing slaves illegal state by state. They all acted to end the international trade. However, it was later reopened in South Carolina and Georgia. In 1807 Congress acted on President Jefferson's advice and made importing slaves from other countries a federal crime, as the Constitution permitted, starting January 1, 1808.\n1790 to 1860.\n\"Fancy ladies\".\nIn the United States in the early nineteenth century, owners of female slaves could freely and legally use them as sexual objects. This is similar to the free use of female slaves on slave ships by the crews.\n\"Fancy\" was a code word that meant the girl or young woman was able to be used for or trained for sexual use. Sometimes, children were also abused like this. The sale of a 13-year-old \"nearly a fancy\" is documented.\nFurthermore, females who were able to become pregnant were supposed to be kept pregnant, so they could make more slaves to sell. The differences in skin color found in the United States make it obvious how often black women were impregnated by whites. For example, in the 1850 Census, 75.4% of \"free negros\" in Florida were described as mulattos, of mixed race. Nevertheless, it is only very recently, with DNA studies, that any sort of reliable number can be provided, and the research has only begun. Light-skinned girls, who contrasted with the darker field workers, were preferred.\nBlacks who owned slaves.\nSome slave owners were black. An African former indentured servant who settled in Virginia in 1621, Anthony Johnson, became one of the earliest documented slave owners in the American colonies. This was documented when he won a civil lawsuit to own a man named John Casor. In 1830, there were 3,775 black slave owners in the South. They owned a total of 12,760 slaves. 80% of the black slave owners lived in Louisiana, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland."}

He had a Nepali wife named Bhrikuti and a Tang wife named Princess Wencheng. Both of them were Buddhists. He also helped invent the Tibetan alphabet and made Classical Tibetan the official language of Tibet at the time.\nHe may have been born in 569 or 605. Tibet used their own calendar so we are still trying to figure it out.\nAs a kid.\nSongtsen Gampo was born at Gyama in Meldro, northeast of modern Lhasa. His dad was the Yarlung king Namri Songtsen. The book \"The Holder of the White Lotus\" says Gampo was the human form (incarnation) of the Avalokite\u015bvara. Dalai Lamas are also thought to be human forms of the Avalokitesvara. In the 11th century, Buddhists started calling him a cakravartin and incarnation of Avalokite\u015bvara.\nFamily.\nSome Dunhuang documents say Gampo had a sister Sad-mar-kar and a younger brother. His younger brother was betrayed and died in a fire after 641. There may have been fighting between his sister and brother.\nSongtsen Gampo's mother was part of the Ts\u00e9pong clan (\"Tibetan Annals\"). She helped unify Tibet. Her name is Driza T\u00f6karma (\"the Bri Wife [named] White Skull Woman\", \"Tibetan Annals\").\nAccording to Tibetan tradition, Songtsen Gampo became king when 13 after his father was poisoned around 618. He was the 33rd king of the Yarlung Dynasty. He was born in the Ox year. Yarlung kings usually took throne at 13. This accords with the tradition that the Yarlung kings took the throne when they were 13, when they were old enough to ride a horse. If this is true, then Gampo may have been born in the Ox year 605 CE. The \"Old Book of Tang\" confirms that he \"was still a minor when he succeeded to the throne.\"\nGampo's wives and children.\nGampo had six wives. Five are listed:\nIn Tibetan tradition, these last two wives helped bring Buddhism to Tibet. The two great influences on Tibetan Buddhism are Indo-Nepali and Han Buddhism.\nGampo's son, Gungsong Gungtsen, died before his father. So Gampo's son, Mangsong Mangtsen, took the throne. His mother may have been Wencheng or Mangmoje Trikar. Trikar is mentioned in \"Genealogy,\" in a hidden library in the caves in Dunhuang, and the \"Tibetan Annals\", which list the names of the Tibetan emperors, their mothers, and their clans.\nSome sources tell a different story. When Gungsong Gungtsen turned 13 (nowadays 12 as Tibet used a different calendar), his dad Gampo retired, so Gungsong ruled for five years. They say Gungsong married 'A-zha Mang-mo-rje when he was thirteen, and they had a son, Mangsong Mangtsen (r. 650-676 CE). Gungsong then died when he was 18. His dad Gampo then took the throne again. Gungsong Gungtsen may be buried at Donkhorda, the site of the royal tombs, to the left of his grandfather Namri Songtsen (gNam-ri Srong-btsan). The dates for these events are very unclear.\nWhat did he do for Tibet?\nHe made an Alphabet.\nSongtsen Gampo sent Thonmi Sambhota to India to create a new alphabet for Classical Tibetan. This led to the first written works, literature, and constitution.\nHe brought new culture.\nHe brought new culture and tech to Tibet.\nThe \"Old Book of Tang\" (\"Jiu Tangshu\" \u65e7\u5510\u4e66) says in 648 a northern Indian army attacked some some Tang Chinese (including Wang Xuanze). So with the Nepali and Tang, Gampo helped defeat the army and protect the Chinese. In 649, the Tang Emperor Gaozong, a fellow Buddhist, gave him the title \"Binwang\", \"Guest King\" or \"Zongwang\", \"Cloth-tribute King\" and 3,000 rolls of colorful silk. Gaozong also gave Gampo \"silkworms' eggs, mortars and presses for making wine, and workmen to manufacture paper and ink.\"\nTools and astrology was imported from Tang and the Western Xia; the dharma and the art of writing came from India; treasures from the Nepalis and the Mongols; laws from the Uyghurs of the Turkic Khaganate to the North.\nHe introduced Buddhism.\nGampo brought Buddhism to the Tibetan people. He built many Buddhist temples During his reign, people began translating Buddhist texts from Sanskrit into Tibetan.\nHe created a big empire.\nHe defeated the Sumpa in northeastern Tibet around 627 (\"Tibetan Annals\" [\"OTA\"] l. 2).\nHe may have conquered the Zhangzhung (around northern India, western Tibet), or that may have happened after he died. The \"Old Book of Tang\" say that in 634, the Yangtong (the Zhangzhung) and various Qiang peoples \"altogether submitted to him.\"\nHe then unified Yangtong, defeated the 'Azha (Tuyuhun), and then conquered two more Qiang tribes before threatening Songzhou with an army of more than 200,000 men.\nHe conquered the Tangut people (who later formed the Western Xia in 942), the Bailang, and Qiang tribes. The Bailang people were west of the Tanguts and east of the Domi. The Tang previously ruled them since 624.\nNepali princess Bhrikuti.\nThe \"Old Book of Tang\" says: Naling Deva's father was king of \u6ce5\u5a46\u7f85 Nepal (Licchavi kingdom) died. The king died, and then Naling Deva's uncle took over. \"The Tibetans gave [Naling Deva] refuge and reestablished him on his throne [in 641]; that is how he became subject to Tibet.\"\nThe Tibetans traveled to Nepal, and the Naling Deva was happy. Then the Tibetans were attacked by the northern Indian king Harsha. So Naling Deva helped Tibet defeat Harsha's army. Gampo then married Princess Bhrikuti, daughter of Naling Deva.\nTang princess Wencheng.\nThe \"Jiu Tangshu\" records that Gampo sent the first embassy from Tibet to the Tang in 634 CE. It was a \"tribute mission\" with Tibet giving gifts to the Tang. He gave gifts of gold and silk to the Tang emperor and asked for a Tang princess in marriage in return (heqin). Tang said no. So he attacked Songzhou (part of Tang) in 637 and 638. But he then gave up and said sorry. He asked for a wife again, and this time the Tang said yes. And so he married Wencheng, niece of Emperor Taizong of Tang. So there was peace between the Tang and Tibetan empires of China.\nBoth wives Wencheng and Bhrikuti are considered to be Tara, the Goddess of Compassion and female Chenrezig:\nGampo built a city for Wencheng and a palace just for her.\nDefended Xuanze for China.\nChinese monk Xuanzang visited Harsha. Harsha then sent some people to China. China then sent Wang Xuanze and some others back. They traveled through Tibet. Their journey is written in stuff at northern India (Rajgir and Bodhgaya).\nHarsha was then overthrown by Arjuna. In 648 Wang Xuanze made a second journey, but Arjuna treated him badly. So the Tibetans and Nepalese defeated Arjuna.\nSo in 649, Chinese emperor Tang Gaozong rewarded Gampo with the title of King of Xinhai Jun (Himalayan plateau, China).\nGampo died in 649. In 650, the Tang emperor sent an envoy with a \"letter of mourning and condolences\". Gampo's tomb is in the Chongyas Valley near Yalung, 13 m high and 130 m long."}

The first storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon and North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons, Pabuk first appeared as a tropical disturbance in the South China Sea on December 28, 2018, which organized into a tropical depression on December 31.\nStorm history.\nA tropical disturbance formed over the southern portion of the South China Sea on December 28, 2018, absorbing the remnants of on December 30. Under high vertical wind shear, the low-pressure area remained messy until December 31 when it was upgraded to a tropical depression by both the JMA and the JTWC.\nUnder good conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures, good outflow but strong vertical wind shear, Pabuk did not manage to intensify further for\nanother two days until it started to move west-northwestward and entered the Gulf of Thailand on January 3, where vertical wind shear was slightly weaker.\nSoon after Pabuk crossed over into the basin, the IMD started to make warnings on the storm, making Pabuk the earliest-forming cyclonic storm for this basin, as well as the first cyclonic storm with a name originally assigned by RSMC Tokyo. Over the few days days, Pabuk continued moved west-northwestward, before weakening into a well-marked low on January 7. The system's remnant low then turned to the northeast.

{"id": "705275", "revid": "5295", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=705275", "title": "Khazars", "text": "The Khazars were a semi-nomadic Turkic people. They formed an empire called Khazaria in Russia from the 6th to 10th century CE. They came from the Western Turkic Khaganate of the Eurasian steppe, after it was conquered by Tang China.\nKhazaria was an international trading center. It was an important place on the Silk Road that linked China, the Middle East, and the Kievan Rus'. For three centuries (c. 650\u2013965) the Khazars conquered the area from the Volga-Don steppes to Crimea and the Caucasus.\nKhazaria was between the Byzantine Empire, the steppe nomads, and the Umayyad Caliphate. It helped Byzantine defend itself from the Sasanian Persian empire. The alliance ended around 900. Between 965 and 969, the Kievan Rus replaced Khazaria.\nTengrism may have been the main religion, as it was for the Huns and Turkic peoples. Abrahamic religions were also popular. The ruling class may have converted to Judaism in the 8th century.\nSome people think that the Cossacks, Muslim Kumyks, Kazakhs, and some Jews, like the Ashkenazi Jews, descended from the Khazars. Some disagree.\nName.\nKhazar or \"Xazar\" may have come from *Qasar. The Turkic root \"qaz-\" means \"to ramble, to roam\" (used in Qazaqsa or Kazakh). It is similar to the Common Turkic \"kez-\".\nOthers say it is from \"qas-\" (\"tyrannize, oppress, terrorize\") because it is similar to the Uyghur name Qasar.\nOthers think it is a person or tribe's name. For example the Chinese name Kesa for \"Khazars\" may be one of the tribal names of the Uy\u011fur Toquz O\u011fuz (of the Gokturks), namely the \"G\u00e9s\u00e0\". But others say Kesa was not a tribal name but the name of the chief of the \u601d\u7ed3 \"Sijie\" tribe of the Toquz O\u011fuz. Also in Middle Chinese the name \"Khazars\" always comes before the word \"T\u016bju\u00e9\" (\"T\u016bju\u00e9 K\u011bs\u00e0 b\u00f9\": \u7a81\u53a5\u53ef\u85a9\u90e8; \"T\u016bju\u00e9 H\u00e9s\u00e0\": \u7a81\u53a5\u66f7\u85a9).\nKhazar language is extinct. But modern Turkic languages still refer to the Caspian Sea as the \"Khazar Sea\".\nLanguage.\nNo known records of the Khazar language survive. The state was polyglot (spoke multiple languages) and polyethnic. The ruling elite probably spoke an eastern dialect of Shaz Turkic. The ordinary people may have spoken Lir Turkic, such as O\u011furic, Bul\u011faric, Chuvash, and Hunnish. The Persian historian al-I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr\u012b said that the Khazar language was different from any other known language.\nAfter the Khazars became Jewish they may have written in the Hebrew alphabet. Though they spoke a T\u00fcrkic language, they may have also spoke Hebrew.\nHistory.\nWhere are they from?\nThey appear to have came from Mongolia or northern China after the Xi\u014dngn\u00fa (Huns) were defeated by Han dynasty of China (Han\u2013Xiongnu war). The tribes probably had Iranian, proto-Mongolic, Uralic, and Palaeo-Siberian people.\nThe Turkic tribes may have conquered the Western Eurasian steppe as early as 463.\nIn 552, they conquered the Rouran Khaganate and moved westwards, taking more people from Sogdia.\nThe ruling family may have came from the \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3) clan of the West T\u00fcrkic tribes. The Chinese and Arabic records are almost identical, indicating strong support for this theory. The leader may have been Y\u01d0p\u00edsh\u00e8ku\u00ec (\u4e59\u6bd7\u5c04\u5331). He died around 651. Moving west, the Khazars reached Akatziroi, one of the important friends of Byzantium fighting Attila's army.\nHow did it begin?\nKhazaria began after 630. It came from the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Qa\u011fanate, after it was crushed by Tang China between 630\u2013650.\nG\u00f6kt\u00fcrk armies conquered Volga by 549. The \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan whose tribal name was 'T\u00fcrk' (\"the strong one\") arrived in 552. They overthrew the Rourans and created the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Qa\u011fanate.\nThe Chinese Tang Dynasty defeated the Turkic Qa\u011fanate and established the Anxi protectorate (Tang dynasty in Inner Asia). The Khaganate split into many tribes. Some tribes went west to the Sea of Azov area. Ashina and the Khazars went further west.\nIn 657, General S\u016b D\u00ecngf\u0101ng (\u8607\u5b9a\u65b9) dominated the Turks and Central Asia. They imposed Chinese overlordship to the east of those Turkic tribes. In 659 the Chinese defeated the remaining tribes. The Khazars did not dare return.\nInstead the Khazars defeated the Bulgars further west.\nAnd so the Khazars Qaganate was born, from the ruins of a nomadic empire destroyed by the Tang armies to the east. It became the westernmost successor state of the Gokturks.\nThe Khazars conquered the lower Volga region and the area between the Danube and the Dniepr. In 670, they also conquered the Ono\u011fur-Bul\u011far union and made the Onogur-Bulgar language the official language of the empire (lingua franca).\nThe empire is sometimes called a 'steppe Atlantis' (\"stepnaja Atlantida,\" \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0442\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0434\u0430).\nHistorians often call this period the Pax Khazarica. The state became an international center of trade.\nIbn al-Bal\u1e2b\u00ee wrote in \"F\u00e2rsn\u00e2ma\" (c. 1100) that the Sasanian Shah (ruler), \u1e2ausraw 1, An\u00fbs\u00eerv\u00e2n, said there were three kings who had as much power as he did: the King of China, the King of Byzantium, and the king of the Khazars."}

{"id": "705342", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=705342", "title": "Spaceship Earth", "text": "Spaceship Earth (or Spacecraft Earth or Spaceship Planet Earth) is a world view encouraging everyone on Earth to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known use is a passage in Henry George's best known work, \"Progress and Poverty\" (1879).\nFrom book IV, chapter 2: \nIt is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say, \"This is mine!\"\nGeorge Orwell later paraphrases Henry George in \"The Road to Wigan Pier\":\nThe world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.\nIn 1965 Adlai Stevenson made a famous speech to the UN in which he said:\nWe travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave\u2014to the ancient enemies of man\u2014half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.\nThe following year, \"Spaceship Earth\" became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson's, the internationally influential economist Barbara Ward.\nAlso in 1966, Kenneth E. Boulding, who was influenced by reading Henry George, used the phrase in the title of an essay, \"The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth\". Boulding described the past open economy of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the \"cowboy economy\", and continued: \"The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system\".\nThe phrase was also popularized by Buckminster Fuller, who published a book in 1968 under the title of \"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth\". This quotation, referring to fossil fuels, reflects his approach: \n\u2026we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth. These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of Spaceship Earth on Earth Day March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the Japanese Peace Bell: \"May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.\"\nSpaceship Earth is the name given to the diameter geodesic sphere that greets visitors at the entrance of Walt Disney World's Epcot theme park. Housed within the sphere is a dark ride that serves to explore the history of communications and promote Epcot's founding principles, \"[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere.\" A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor Jeremy Irons and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:\nLike a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers\u2026.We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.\nDavid Deutsch has pointed out that the picture of Earth as a friendly \"spaceship\" habitat is difficult to defend even in a metaphorical sense. The Earth environment is harsh and survival is a constant struggle for life, including for whole species trying to avoid extinction. Humans wouldn't be able to live in most of the areas where they are living now without the knowledge necessary to build life-support systems such as houses, heating, water supply, etc.\nThe term \"Spaceship Earth\" is frequently used on the labels of Emanuel Bronner's products to refer to the Earth."}

It is one of the three main existing schools of Buddhism: the other two are Tibetan Buddhism and Theravada. It is mainly practiced in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. It has had a great impact on East Asian culture.\nLike Tibetan Buddhism, Han Buddhism comes from Mahayana, the branch of Buddhism written mainly in Sanskrit and from northern India.\nHan Buddhism has a lot of interaction between the Indian religions and Chinese religions (like Taoism).\nHistory.\nThere are legends that Laozi was the Buddha himself, or that the Buddha came from the Tibetan kingdom of Zhangzhung. There are other legends that Buddhism had existed in China since ancient times (before the Qin dynasty).\nQin dynasty (221\u2013206 bc).\nThe Shiji \u300a\u300bhas a section called\u300c\u7981\u4e0d\u5f97\u7960\u300d(jin bude ci). It says:\n\u201c\u5f99\u8b2b\uff0c\u5be6\u4e4b\u521d\u7e23\u3002\u7981\u4e0d\u5f97\u7960\u3002\u660e\u661f\u51fa\u897f\u65b9\u3002\u201d\nIn the 20th century, Japanese scholar Fujita Toyohachi () said Buddhism entered China during the Qin dynasty. The word \u4e0d\u5f97 (pinyin: \"bude\"; rough pronunciation: boo-duh) is pronounced nearly exactly like the Sanskrit word \"Buddha\". It was used to write down Buddha in the Chinese language. Others (like ) disagreed. Moreover it is unlikely \u5f97 would be used to transliterate. And based on the evolution of Chinese tones, \u4e0d\u5f97 would sound something like putug ( says \u201c\u4e0d\u5f97\u201d is [p\u026ft\u026f\u02d0\u0261]).\nHan Dynasty (206 bc\u2013220 ce).\nIt is generally believed Buddhism was introduced during the (Western, before 1 BC) Han dynasty. It came from the western regions and Silk Road.\nAccording to the Weil\u00fce\u300a\u2027\u897f\u620e\u50b3\u300b\u3001\u300a\u2027\u91cb\u8001\u5fd7\u300band other records, Emperor Ai of Han's men gave the people the Pagoda Sutra\u300a\u6d6e\u5c60\u7ecf\u300b\u3002\nIn 67, Emperor Ming of Han dreamed of the \"Golden People\". He sent people to meet monks in the western regions. These monks brought back more Buddhist texts. He built the White horse temple () and translated 42 chapters of the scripture \u300a\u300b\u3002\nThere is one account that Emperor Ming of Han (28\u201375 CE) helped introduce Buddhism into China. The (3rd - 5th century) \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" says:Ming then sent people to Tianzhu (Southern India) to learn more. Buddhist scriptures returned to China on the backs of white horses, after which White Horse Temple was named. Two Indian monks also returned with them, named Dharmaratna and Ka\u015byapa M\u0101ta\u1e45ga.\nWhether Emperor Ming actually dreamed of Golden people is debated. However scholars agree that around his time Buddhism arrived from the xiyu.\nA Parthian prince named An Shigao traveled to China annd helped translate some Indian texts into Chinese.\nIn 167 some Yuezhi (tribes of Central Asia) also helped translate some stuff.\nDuring this time, Mahayana Buddhism became popular in China. The Han would then \"sinicize\" it to turn it into Han Buddhism.\nIn Chongqing an ancient Yao Qian Shu (money tree artifact) was dug up. A Buddha was sitting on it. It said it was made in the fourth year of Yan guang (125 CE). This is the earliest known bronze Buddha found in China. There is another early Buddha sculpture in Sichuan above a grave.\nEarly Buddhist schools.\nThe Sarvastivadinns, Dharmaguptakas, and other schools were important for Han Buddhism.\nSix Dynasties (220\u2013589).\nSome Chinese thought Buddhism was harmful to the authority of the government, that Buddhists did help improve the economy, that Buddhism was barbaric and did not deserve to be part of Chinese culture. However, others mixed Buddhism with Taoism. The two went well together. Both encourage meditation. And so Buddhist ideas were used in Taoism and vice versa.\nAround this time, Han Buddhism began spreading to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. It was already popular in South China.\nKum\u0101raj\u012bva (334\u2013413).\nChina controlled Kucha, a Buddhist kingdom in Xinjiang. They imprisoned Kumarajiva but released him in 401 because he was good at Buddhism.\nHe became influential in Han Buddhism.\nEmperor Yao Xing of the state of Later Qin liked him.\nHe made a number of good translations (from AD 402\u2013413).\nThis includes the \"Diamond Sutra\", the \"Amitabha Sutra\", the \"Lotus Sutra\", the \"Vimalak\u012brti Nirde\u015ba S\u016btra\", the \"M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101\", and the \"A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra\".\nCh\u00e1n Buddhism.\nIn the 5th century, the Ch\u00e1n (Zen) teachings began in China. Bodhidharma, a legend, started it.\nThe school follows the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\" and \"Diamond S\u016btra (Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra) .\" It was also called the \"One Vehicle School.\"\nThey were famous for their \"encounter stories\" and koans and their teaching methods. Nan Huai-Chin says: \nTang Dynasty (618\u2013907).\nXuanzang's journey to the west.\nDuring the Tang dynasty and 629 - 645, the monk Xuanzang went to India and visited over one hundred kingdoms. He and wrote about his journey to the west. His writing is important for studying India during this period of time.\nHe visited many spiritual sites, many spiritual people, and learned a lot of spiritual things. He met Buddhist celebrities.\nHe returned to China with 657 Sanskrit texts, gifts, statues, and Buddhist souvenirs, all on twenty-two horses.\nXuanzang created a translation center in Chang'an (now Xi'an). It attracted people from all over East Asia. Xuanzang translated 1,330 books into Chinese. His favorite part of Buddhism was Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, or \"Consciousness-only\".\nDuring this time, Han Chan Buddhism became popular in Japan.\nSong Dynasty (960\u20131279).\nDuring the Song dynasty, Ch\u00e1n (\u79aa) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country. Ch\u00e1n became the most popular type of Chinese Buddhism.\nYuan Dynasty (1279\u20131368).\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, the Mongol emperors liked Tibetan Buddhism so they hired Tibetan monks as government officials. This caused corruption. Later the Ming dynasty overthrew the Yuan, and Tibetan lamas no longer influenced the court.\nMing dynasty (1368\u20131644).\nThe Chan school was so popular that all monks belonged to it. Male and female Chinese buddhists wrote nice poetry during this time.\nQing dynasty (1644\u20131911).\nThe Qing supported Tibetan Buddhism.\nAround 1900, Buddhists from other Asian countries became interested in Chinese Buddhism. Anagarika Dharmapala visited Shanghai in 1893. He and other Indians tried to get Chinese to help revive Buddhism in India. Japanese Buddhists also visited China. By this point (and perhaps earlier) China had the most Buddhists in the world.\nTeachings.\nHan Buddhism uses concepts from Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism. They worship the Buddha and Bodhisattvas by giving food, flowers, etc. They are vegans. They believe in god and hell, life after death and karma."}

He won many battles. In 657 he destroyed the Western Turkic Khaganate. This expanded the Tang's western borders to their farthest extent (deep into Central Asia, close to modern Iran). In 660, he also conquered Baekje.\nHe was born in Wuyi (\u6b66\u9091, modern Hengshui, Hebei). \nWestern Turks.\nIn spring 657, Emperor Gaozong sent Su Dingfang to attack the Western Turks. He had the following friends to help him:\nThe Tang took went north. \nSu defeated Chumukun first. \nSu had fewer than 20,000 men. Ashina Helu's army had nearly 100,000 men. Ashina Helu thought he could defeat Su easily. His army ran at Su but could not break through Su's defense: the front line pointed long spears. Su then counterattacked with cavalry, defeating Helu's army and killing and capturing several tens of thousands of men. Helu ran away.\nSu kept going. Many tribes of the Western Turks surrendered to Su, including the general Huluwu (\u80e1\u797f\u5c4b), surrendered, and Ashina Helu fled along with his general Qul\u00fc (\u5c48\u5f8b). The rest surrendered to Ashina Buzhen.\nSu kept chasing Helu but ran into snow storms. Su's men said maybe they should wait for weather to get better. But Su said that Helu would be surprised if they attacked him. So Su and his army kept going. They joined Mishe and Buzhen, made a surprise attack on Helu, and captured or killed tens of thousands.\nBut Helu fled to Shi (\u77f3\u570b, modern Tashkent, Uzbekistan), a vassal of the Western Turks. \nBut Shi did not want to be attacked and defeated by the Tang as well. So they just captured and handed Helu to the Tang. \nAnd so the Tang conquered the Western Turkic Khaganate and brought Central Asia under Chinese control.\nSome Turks escaped west and became the Khazars in Russia. They did not come back.\nSu presented Helu to Emperor Gaozong. Gaozong spared Helu and promoted Su to major general. He also made Su the Duke of Xing and made his son Su Qingjie (\u8607\u6176\u7bc0) the Duke of Wuyi.\nIzgil.\nDuman (\u90fd\u66fc) was a commander of the Izgil tribe (Old Turkic: , Chinese: Sijie \u601d\u7d50), under Tang rule. The Shule (\u758f\u52d2), Zhujubo (\u6731\u4ff1\u6ce2), and Yebantuo (\u8b01\u822c\u9640) were also Turkic kingdoms under Tang rule. They were around Kashgar, Xinjiang. \nIn 659 they rebelled against the Tang. Duman got Yutian (\u4e8e\u7530, in modern Hotan, Xinjiang). \nIn winter 659, Gaozong sent Su Dingfang to Xinjiang. Once Su arrived he gathered 10,000 soldiers and 3,000 horsesoldiers and made a surprise attack on Duman. \nDuman was surprised, and after Su defeated Duman, Duman retreated into Yutian. \nSu seiged the city, and Duman surrendered. \nIn spring 660, Su took Duman to the eastern capital Luoyang. Su presented Duman to Gaozong. Some wanted Duman to be executed. But Su said Duman should be spared. Gaozong said that by law, Duman should die, but he would respect Su's promise and thus spared Duman.\nTibet.\nThe \"Old Tibetan Annals\", written in Classical Tibetan, was discovered at Dunhuang in the early 20th century. It says Su Dingfang fought the Tibetans in 659: \n\"Da Rgyal Mang Po Rjes (Dayan Mangbuzhi) fought a battle with Su Dingfang of the Tang at the Dongdai \u6771\u5cb1 (a Tibetan regional administrative unit) of Wuhai \u70cf\u6d77 (southwest of Lake Qinghai). Da Rgyal was killed and his army of 80,000 men was defeated by 1,000 Tang troops.\"\nBaekje.\nIn spring 660, Tang was allies with Silla, in the Korean Peninsula. Silla was being attacked by Baekje so Silla asked the Tang for help. The Tang sent help.\nEmperor Gaozong put Su in charge of the Silla-Tang combined army and navy. He, alongside Silla's King Muyeol, sent 100,000 soldiers to attack Baekje. \nIn summer 660, Su left Chengshan (\u6210\u5c71, in modern Weihai, Shandong) and crossed the Yellow Sea to Baekje. \nBaekje forces tried to prevent Tang forces from landing, but could not. \nThe Tang directly attacked the Baekje capital Sabi and seiged it. Baekje surrendered, and the Tang annexed Baekje. \nIn winter 660, Su brought prisoners to Emperor Gaozong in Luoyang.

A lot of information contains Helmold's Chronica Sclavorum. There's also Chronicle of Thietmar, and the other chronicles, although they are not the only sources of information about Slavs and their beliefs. There's also for example from the diary of a Jewish trader of the Slaves - Ibrahim Ibn Jacob.\nGods and Goddesses.\nThe pantheon of gods in Slavic beliefs was large. Some of the most important are:\nSome regions had different gods for different concepts. For example, West Slavs (mainly Polabians and Volinians) believed that Svetovid was a creator of the world while eastern ones believed that it was Rod.\nDemons.\nSlavs had their own demonology. One of the most well-known demons in Slavic beliefs is Baba Yaga, with the appearance of an ugly and deformed woman. Baba Yaga has its counterparts in many european beliefs, such as the German Frau Holle and Italian Befana. There are also a lot of similarities the with Greek mythological witch Circe. There are also :\nHistory.\nPoland.\nPolans and other Polish tribes came to the territory of today's Poland, probably in the VIII and IX century, bringing their beliefs on the west. Polans and their beliefs describes the Primary Chronicle wrote by Ruthenian chronicler Nestor. There are also famous Helmold's Chronica Slavorum and the other chronicles and notes of German bishops, geographs, as well as the old Ruthenian chroniclers and Jewish or Arabian traders of Slavs. The history of paganism as the main religion in Poland ends Baptism of Poland in 966, but it is not end of Slavic paganism in this country at all. Pagans would not agree to Christian reforms of Mieszko I and his sons, causing a Pagan Reaction in Poland that culminated in uprising of pagans in 1037-1038 (later supressed by Casimir the Restorer). During the uprising, pagans killed priests and destroyed churches.The end of the uprising was not the end of paganism in Poland. Pagans lived in Poland even to the XII century, when last pagans were Christianised in West Pomerania by bishop Otto from Bamberg and Boleslav III Wrymouth.\nBohemia.\nThe beginings of Czech statehood we can found in 895, when there was founded the first Czech country ruled by the Premyslid dynasty. It was pagan until 925, when the country was baptized from the hands of east Franks. Pagan elites knew that it would cause the moving them away from power and will increase Frankish influence. They caused a rebellion against Vaclav, which failed. The leader of the rebellion was his wife - Drahomira. Although she lost the rebellion, there were still elites that resisted the reigns of Vaclav, so the brother of the Duke Boleslav I organised a coup against him. Probably in 935 during the feast, one of the followers of Boleslav, murdered Vaclav and his brother became the Duke of Bohemia. During his reign there were many pagans, many of which were Christianised after his death. It is unknown when the last Czech pagans were Christianised.\nRuthenia.\nThe term \"Ruthenia\" can refer to Kievan Rus', Novogrodian Rus', or Volynians and other Ruthenian, east Slavic countries and tribes. Paganism survived among the Eastern Slavs the longest time without being baptized. The baptism of Kievan Rus', toke from the hand of the Byzantines, didn't end Paganism in this country, although it caused paganism to become less popular, and a many people didin't admit to practicing Slavic beliefs. Vladimir the Great started the mass baptism of people in Dnieper, which didn't end paganism among people. The family of Vladimir was offically baptized, but still practiced paganism for a long time. There still existed Ruthenian tribes that were pagan, for example Volynians or White Croats. The last pagans survived maybe even to XIII century.\nSerbia.\nWhite Serbs, a Slavic tribe from White Serbia first settled in an area near Thessaloniki on the Balkans and in the 6th and early 7th century, established the Serbian Principality by the 8th century. The serbian rulers adopted the Byzantine Rite in 870. Serbians adopted well the new religion and, unlike in the countries above, there were not any pagan rebellions against the Christianity."}

It is now the People's Republic of China. It was created in January 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. The Republic's first president was Sun Yat-sen. Sun's party, the Kuomintang (KMT) won the parliamentary election in December 1912. \nBut Sun soon gave the position to Yuan Shikai, the leader of the Beiyang Army. The Beiyang Army also controlled the Beiyang government (which controlled Mongolia). \nBetween late 1915 and early 1916, Yuan Shikai called himself the Emperor of China. But people did not like it (National protection war). \nAfter Yuan died death in 1916, the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty. Various groups in the Beiyang Army claimed independence and fought with each other during the Warlord Era.\nIn 1921, the KMT created a rival government in Canton, supported by the Communist Party of China (CPC). \nNorth China was overtaxed and had too many fighting warlords. So its economy died between 1927 and 1928. \nGeneral Jiang Jieshi became the KMT leader after Sun's death. Jiang started the Northern Expedition in 1926 and overthrew the Beiyang government in 1928. In April 1927, Jiang created a nationalist government in Nanjing and massacred Communists in Shanghai. This forced the CPC into armed rebellion, starting the Chinese Civil War.\nChina experienced industrialization and modernization but suffered conflicts between the Nationalist government in Nanking, the CPC, warlords, and the Empire of Japan. \nEventually the Chinese unified to fight against their common enemy: the Japanese. In 1937 the Imperial Japanese Army invaded China in 1937. The Second Sino-Japanese War began.\nIn 1945 Japan surrendered at the end of World War II.\nIn 1946, the Chinese Civil War between the KMT and CPC restarted. \nIn 1949, the CPC defeated the KMT and started the People's Republic of China (PRC).\nJiang Jieshi and the KMT fled to Taiwan."}

It has hundreds of local languages, many of which are not mutually understandable. There is more variation in the mountainous southeast. There are main seven groups: Mandarin, Wu, Min, Xiang, Gan, Hakka and Yue. But more research is being done.\nChinese varieties differ most in their phonology (sounds), but have similar vocabulary and syntax (grammar). Southern varieties tend to have fewer initial consonants but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants. All have tones. Northern varieties have fewer tones. Many have tone sandhi (biandao). Zhejiang coast and eastern Guangdong has some of the most complex patterns.\nStandard Chinese is based on the Beijing dialect. Its vocabulary is based on Mandarin group and grammar based on literature in the modern written vernacular. It is the official language of China, one of the four official languages of Singapore, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\nHistory.\nIn 2nd millennium BC, a form of Chinese was spoken in around the Huanghe. It then expanded east across the North China Plain to Shandong and then south towards the Yangzi river valley. It replaced former languages in the south.\nDuring times of unity, people wanted to use a common standard language to make communication easier between people.\nEvidence for dialectal variation is found in texts from the Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013479 BC). At that time, the Zhou still defined a standard speech. The \"Fangyan\" (1st century CE) studies the differences in vocabulary between regions. Texts from the Eastern Han period also discuss local differences in pronunciation. The \"Qieyun\" rhyme book (601) noted wide variation in pronunciation between regions. It wanted to define a standard pronunciation for reading the classics. This standard is called Middle Chinese.\nThe North China Plain was flat and easy to move around. So people in the north pretty much spoke the same language.\nBut South China had many mountains and rivers. So it had six major groups of Chinese languages, with great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.\nModern Standard Chinese.\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local language. But the Ming and Qing dynasties defined a common language based on Mandarin. It was known as \"Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0\" (\u5b98\u8a71, \"speech of officials\"). Knowledge of guanhua was essential for a career as a government official.\nUntil the 20th century, Classical Chinese was the written standard.\nThe Republic of China replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. In the 1930s a standard national language was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China.\nStandard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life. The only other Chinese that may be commonly taught in colleges is Cantonese.\nThe different Chinese languages.\nRelationships between groups.\nThese are sometimes divided into three groups: Northern (Mandarin), Central (Wu, Gan, and Xiang) and Southern (Hakka, Yue, and Min).\nSouthern Group may come from the Yangzi river during the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD). This is sometimes called the Old Southern Chinese.\nThe Central group was transitional between the Northern and Southern groups."}

The religion of Zhangzhung is Bon, and the people are sometimes called Bonpo. The Bon religion influenced Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. The Zhangzhung are mentioned frequently in Tibetan texts as the original rulers of central and western Tibet.\nWe are still trying to learn more about them.\nWhere was it?\nZhang Zhung had three different regions:\nIt was an independent kingdom and covered all of Western Tibet.\nThe capital was Khyunglung, the \"Silver Palace of Garuda\", southwest of Mount Kailash, with palaces found in the upper Sutlej Valley.\nHistory.\nIron Age.\nScientists dug stuff in the Chang Tang plateau and found iron. These may be the Zhangzhung's iron.\nUnification of Tibet.\nThe \"Tang Annals\" say that the Tibetan emperor Songtsen Gampo conquered and unified the Zhangzhung. In 634, Yangtong (Zhang Zhung) and various Qiang tribes, \"altogether submitted to him.\" Gampo then united the Yangtong to defeat the 'Azha or Tuyuhun and conquer two more Qiang tribes. He then threatened Songzhou (China) with an army of more than 200,000 men. He then sent gifts of gold and silk to the Tang emperor to marry a princess. At first the Emperor Gaozong of Tang refused so Gampo attacked Songzhou. But Gampo later gave up and apologized so the emperor married him to Princess Wencheng.\nWhat language did they speak?\nThere are some Zhangzhung texts and 11th century bilingual Tibetan documents. The Zhangzhung language was related to Kinnauri, a Sino\u2013Tibetan language.\nThe Bonpo claim that the Tibetan writing system is derived from the Zhangzhung alphabet. However Tibetan script comes from a North Indian script. Non-Bon Tibetan texts agree.\nA modern Kinnauri language of the same name (pronounced Jangshung) is spoken by 2,000 people in the Sutlej Valley of Himachal Pradesh, India. They claim to be descendants of the Zhangzhung.\nZhangzhung's influence in India.\nBonpo religion was founded by a Buddha-like person named Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. Tonpa's teachings are very similar to Gautama Buddha. Bonpos claim that Tonpa lived 18,000 years ago and visited Tibet from the land of Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring (modern Tajikstan) or Shambhala.\nThe Bonpo claim that during this time Lord Tonpa's teachings entered the Indian subcontinent and helped develop the Vedic religion (Hinduism).\nAn example of this link between Bon and Hinduism is Mount Kailash, the center of Zhang Zhung culture and also most sacred mountain to Hindus. As a result, the Bonpos claim that Hinduism owes its origin to Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche."}

When the referee is going to review a play on the field at the VAR box, they outline a square with their hands, as if showing the outline of a TV screen. It was used for the first time in the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. It was used for the first time for international matches in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. The first time VAR was used in the FIFA World Cup was in the 2018 World Cup.\nIn March 2018, the VAR was permanentely written into the Laws of the Game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).\nThere are 3 categories of decisions that can be reviewed:\nThe referee can review the play on the field by going to the VAR box, listen to the VAR's recommendation, or completely ignore the VAR advice. The referee can only review the play on the field with recommendation of the VAR to prevent the referee from relying on it too much.\nCriticism.\nThe VAR system has been criticised by many people, mostly because of how much time is used up in reviews, overly relying on it, and causing confusion. Manager Mauricio Pochettino said \"it made everyone confused\". He also said that he felt sorry for the fans and for the referee after an FA Cup match."}

These conflicts happened in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the 1920s. The various Indian Wars resulted from a wide variety of factors, including cultural differences, land disputes, and crimes committed by both sides. The European powers and their colonies also enlisted Indian tribes to help them do war against each other's colonial settlements.\nAfter the American Revolution, many conflicts were local to specific states or regions. The conflicts were usually about disputes over land use; some had cycles of violent actions. The British Royal Proclamation of 1763, included in the Constitution of Canada, banned white settlers from taking the lands of native peoples in Canada without signing a treaty with them. It is still law in Canada today, and 11 Numbered Treaties, limited the number of conflicts.\nAs white settlers went west across America after 1780, the size, length of time, and intensity of conflicts increased between settlers and various Indians. The biggest came in the War of 1812, which resulted in the defeat of major Indian coalitions in the Midwest and the South. Conflict with settlers happened less, and treaties became more common. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 allowed the US government to remove natives from east of the Mississippi River to the west. The west was what the government believed to be empty American frontier. (Many tribes had a lot of territory in this area, however.) The federal US policy of removal was eventually changed in the West. It was changed to relocating Indian tribes to specially designated and federally protected reservations."}

The London Ragged Schools Union was established in April 1844. They gave free education, food, clothes and other services. The classes were sometimes held in stables, lofts and railway arches. Most teachers were volunteers but there were some who were paid. About 300,000 children went to London ragged schools between 1844 and 1881.\nThe context.\nThere was no legal structure which supported primary education in England until the second half of the 19th century. There were, however, Church of England schools.\nParliament did not lay down rules for education until 1870, the year of Forster's Education Act (Elementary Education Act of 1870). The Elementary Education Act 1880 (the Mundella Act) made school boards enforce compulsory attendance from 5 to 10 years. Attendance officers might visit the homes of absent (truant) children. Children who were employed needed a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard. Employers of these children who could not show this were penalised.\nThe 1891 Elementary Education Act provided for the state payment of school fees up to ten shillings per head. This made primary education free. The Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893 raised the school leaving age to 11. "}

It is in western Syria, bordering Turkey. Its reported area varies in different sources from 2,297\u00a0km\u00b2 to 2,437\u00a0km\u00b2. The governorate population was 991,000 (2010 estimate). Members of the Alawite sect are the majority in the governorate, although Armenians, Turkmen, and Sunni Kurds form the majorities in the Kessab, Jabal Turkman, and Jabal al-Akrad regions respectively. The capital of Latakia had, by 2010 estimates, 400,000 inhabitants, 50% of whom were Alawites, 30% were Sunni, and 20% Christian.\nGeography.\nThe Latakia Governorate borders Turkey to the north, Tartous to the south, Hama and Idlib to the east and the Mediterranean sea to the west. Although the western part of the governorate is mainly of coastal plains, the eastern parts are mountainous, with the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range running north to south, parallel to the coastal plains. Its highest peak, Nabi Yunis, is 1562 meters (5,125 ft) tall with the average elevation only about 1200 meters. The western areas of the governorate catch moisture-laden winds from the Mediterranean Sea and are thus more fertile and more heavily populated than the eastern slopes.\nThe Orontes River flows north alongside the range on its eastern verge in the Ghab valley, a longitudinal trench, and then around the northern edge of the range to flow into the Mediterranean. Another important river is Nahr al-Kabir al-Shamali, a river running from the Turkish border and to the southwest to flow in the Mediterranean with the \"16 Tishreen dam\", one of the most important in the region, being constructed to use the river power generation, storage of rain and river water, and the creation of \"Mashqita lake\".\nCities.\nThe following cities are the administrative centres of the districts in Latakia Governorate (Population based on 2004 official census):\nDistricts.\nThe governorate is divided into four districts (\"manatiq\"):\nThese are further divided into 22 sub-districts (nawahi).\nEconomy.\nThe governorate is located on the Mediterranean Sea, which gave it great economic importance, most notably the capital of the governorate, Latakia, which serves as not only the governorate's but also Syria's main port. Its port was established on 12 February 1950.\nIts imported cargo include clothing, construction materials, vehicles, furniture, minerals, tobacco, cotton, and food supplies such as lintels, onions, wheat, barley, dates, grains and figs, and in 2008, the port handled about 8 million tons of cargo.\nThe governorate is also a tourist destination for many Syrian locals, the Cote d'Azur Beach of Latakia is Syria's premier coastal resort, and offers water skiing, jet skiing, and windsurfing. The city contains eight hotels, two of which have five-star ratings; both the Cote d'Azur de Cham Hotel and L\u00e9 Meridien Lattiquie Hotel are located north of the city, at Cote d'Azur. The latter hotel has 274 rooms and is the only international hotel in the city.\nAlso, window shopping and evening strolls in the markets is considered a favorite pastime in Latakia. Numerous designer-label stores line 8 Azar Street, and the heart of the city's shopping area is the series of blocks enclosed by 8 Azar Street, Yarmouk Street, and Saad Zaghloul Street in the city center. Cinemas in Latakia include Ugarit Cinema, al-Kindi, and a smaller theater off al-Moutanabbi Street.\nDemography.\nIn 2010, Latakia City was 50% Alawite, 40% Sunni and 10% Christian, however, the rural hinterland has an Alawite majority of roughly 70%, with Christians making up 14%, Sunni Muslims making up 12%, and Ismailis representing the remaining 2%. The city of Latakia, the governorate's center, serves as the capital of the Alawite population and is a major cultural center for the religion. Christians form a majority in the northmost part of the governorate, in the town of Kessab, and in many neighborhoods in Latakia such as the American street.\nLanguages.\nThe primary languages of the province are Arabic, Armenian and Turcoman. Arabic is spoken in all district centers of the governorate and most, if not all towns and villages surrounding them, with the North Levantine dialect mostly used, with the exception of the town of Kessab, a historically Armenian-populated town where Armenian is the primary language in it and the surrounding villages such as Sev Aghpyur, Esguran and Duzaghaj, and the Turkmen Mountain where Turcoman is spoken primarily.\nThe Kurdish minority in the governorate have mostly shifted to speaking Arabic in recent years, but nonetheless, those who speak Kurdish use the Kurmanji dialect of the language, mainly in Jabal al-Akrad."}

One of the most common type of honing oil is the one used with sharpening stones. Not only they protect the sharpening stone but they also keep the stone pores from clogging.\nThere are different types of honing oil and substitutes. It has been noticed that some people use water instead of honing oil to make the sharpening process smooth. Although, water is no substitute of honing oil according to many chefs and experts.\nThe thickness of honing oil matters a lot. For example, motor oil, which is another type of honing oil, cannot be used with sharpening stones since it is too thick and instead of protecting the sharpening stone pores, it will clog them. \nComposition and toxicity.\nThe composition of honing oil is simple. There are two types of honing oil. One is the water based honing oil and the other is petroleum based. Chlorine and sulfur are the most common chemicals that are found in petroleum and mineral based honing oil.\nSome honing oil could be toxic for specific materials such as petroleum based honing oil for sharpening stones. Windex, Simple Green and Lansky are some of the most common honing oil manufacturers."}

Thornton (1830-1916) \nBecame the first vicar of the parish of Exmoor, Somerset, England in 1856. Exmoor was 18,810 acres and had not had a spiritual leader because the population was too small. By 1856, the population had expanded to give the area parish status.\nMarried Grace Anne Furnival in 1857\nBrought William Burgess to justice for the murder of Anna Burgess, his daughter, in 1858. This followed a chase on horseback from Somerset into Wales.\nMoved as rector, to Dunsford, Devon, England in 1860\nBecame rector of North Bovey in Devon in 1866 and served there for 50 years.\nChased a fraudster to France in 1867, caught him and recovered \u00a340,000 for the church\nDied in 1916 and is buried, alongside his wife, in North Bovey churchyard.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Henry Thornton was born, 9th March 1830. His father was head of the tax department Somerset house and they lived in Clapham Common, London. Educated at Rugby school, where one day, in 1847, following a cross country run to the village of Newbold, the seventeen year old Thornton bought some unripe greengages from a street seller and contracted what is believed to be cholera. He was seriously ill for a time, and, upon recovery was found to be \u201crather delicate\u201d. He went to a friend in Allerford village in the Selworthy district of the Porlock valley, Somersetshire, to convalesce. and build up his strength. His life would have included hunting, fishing, shooting and riding (at which he would cover prodigious distances for the rest of his life). He developed a lifelong love for the Porlock Valley, which he called \u201cThe happy valley and the fairest and choicest little district which exists on the face of the earth\u201d. It was here that he first met Sir Thomas Acland (11th Baronet), from the Holnicote Estate (now owned by the National Trust). He had access to the extensive lands and guns on the estate. He also became a frequent visitor to a house known as Glenthorn, 10 miles away in Countisbury, where he made the acquaintance, and later, friendship of the Knight family from Simonsbath, on Exmoor. It was at this time, also, that he made the acquaintance of John \u201cJack\u201d Russell, the sporting parson, from Swimbridge, Devon, and they remained in touch until Russell\u2019s death in 1883. Thornton left the Porlock Valley in 1849 and matriculated to Trinity College Cambridge on 24th January. He entered as a \"pensioner\" (that is a student without emolument). This meant that he was only able to take an ordinary degree (BA) which he gained in 1853. He was awarded an MA from the same college in 1859. \nHe left the college in February 1853 although he remained in lodgings in the city. He studied here, for the voluntary theological examination, which he passed in the October. He was ordained at Exeter cathedral in December 1853. He was offered the curacy of Lynton, Devon. During this time he established an effective school at Countisbury, and taught there himself most mornings. He resigned the curacy after 2 years. \nLater life.\nThe population of Simonsbath had expanded due to mining in the area to become the parish of Exmoor. His friend Mr. Knight offered him the living at the newly built church and vicarage in the village. So, in 1856, he became the first vicar of Exmoor.\nIn 1857 he married Grace Anna Furnival (1826 \u2013 1916). They went on to have 8 daughters, although 2 of these died in infancy and the firstborn is buried in the churchyard at Simonsbath.\nTwo years into his incumbency on Exmoor the murder of Anna Maria Burgess, aged 6, took place. She died at the hand of her father, William Burgess, who gave out the story that Anna had gone to live with her grandmother in Porlock Weir. Thornton checked with the grandmother, who confirmed that she had not seen the child. Without a body Thornton could prove nothing but Burgess fled and Thornton personally rode into Wales, where he had tracked him down. He brought him back, and had him held in Exford whilst he awaited permission from the authorities to drain the flooded, and defunct, Wheal Eliza mine, a mile and a half along the Barle Valley from Simonsbath village. Local rumour had it that lights had been seen over the mineshaft and sheep-stealers had found an empty grave upon the moor. It took until the October for permission to be granted to pump the shaft and, in the November, a local young man volunteered to be lowered down it. 360 feet down he found a bundle and, when it was recovered to the surface, Thornton unwrapped it to discover the remains of the child. Burgess was tried at Taunton Assizes, found guilty of the murder, and sentenced to hang.\nThornton was his parish priest, and was conscious of his responsibility in that regard, so he visited Burgess in prison and heard his confession. Burgess then also confessed to being responsible for an arson attack at a local farm some years previously. This had resulted in three deaths. Thornton visited the other two Burgess children, working in service and told them of their sister\u2019s death at the hands of their father. He tried to persuade them to see Burgess, but they refused. Burgess shook his hand before he died. \nThe remoteness of Simonsbath in mid-Victorian times proved a worry to Grace Thornton, with young daughters, as the nearest medical man was 11 miles away in South Molton, so, in 1860 the family moved south into Devon to take up the living at Dunsford.\nHe liked the church there very much but they both missed the moorland people and the bracing moorland air. In 1866, having left a second baby girl buried in Dunsford churchyard, they removed to the parish of North Bovey on Dartmoor, Devon, England.\nThey remained in North Bovey for 50 years. Thornton went on to become Rural dean in 1870, and also held services in other Dartmoor churches, including an open-air one at Postbridge. \nIn 1867 he chased a fraudster (a trustee of the church) to Paris, France, leaving North Bovey on the Tuesday morning. He took a night boat to Boulogne from London and arrived back at the London solicitor\u2019s office on the Thursday morning with the recovered \u00a340,000 in his pocket, and made it home to North Bovey in time for dinner the same evening.\nThornton created his memoirs over a number of years and published 2 volumes privately. Reminiscences of an Old West Country Clergyman volumes 1 and 2 were leather bound hardback books. An edited version of the both was published in paperback in 2010.\nHe predeceased Grace by a few months in 1916; he died on the 31st of March and she in the December. They are both buried in North Bovey churchyard."}

They spoke the Ruanruan language, an Altaic or Sino\u2013Tibetan language. \nThey descended from the Xianbei. The Rouran are the first to use the words \"khan\" or \"khagan\". The Rouran Khaganate existed between the 4-6 centuries. They were then overthrown by the Gokturks. This led to the rise of the Turkic peoples. \nThe Rouran may have fled west after that and become part of the Pannonian Avars. The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks chased after these \"Avars\" into the Byzantine Empire.\nWhere are they from?\nThe Rouran were nomads. They lived in the eastern Eurasian Steppe (Mongolia and northeast China). They overthrew the Xianbei. Most Xianbei moved south and lived in Northern China. Kwok Kin Poon argues the Rouran descended from the Donghu Xianbei.\nHistory.\nThe founder of the Rouran Khaganate was Yujiulu Shelun. He descended from slaves of the Xianbei. The Xianbei used the word rouran to mean \"wriggling worms\". \nAfter the Xianbei moved south in the 3rd century, the Rouran took over and conquered a lot of land.\nIn 402 Shelun unified all of the Rouran. They defeated the neighboring Tiele and expanded to the Silk Roads. They then conquered and vassalized the Hephthalites (of Central Asia) until 5th century. \nThe Hepthalites then moved towards India and replaced the Yuezhi in Bactria. The Hephtalites borrowed much culture and language from the Rouran: including the word \"Khan\".\nIn 429, Northern Wei (where the Xianbei settled) attacked the Rouran and killed many.\nIn 434, the Rouran made a heqin with Northern Wei.\nBetween 440-460, the Northern Wei attacked and defeated the Rouran several times.\nThe Rouran made a heqin with the Han-Chinese ruler Gao Huan of Eastern Wei.\nIn 508, the Tiele defeated the Rouran. \nIn 516, the Rouran defeated the Tiele. \nOverthrow by Gokturks.\nIn 551, Bumin of the Ashina G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks () defeated the Tiele revolt for the Rouran. In return Bumin asked for a Rouran princess (heqin). Rouran refused, so Bumin declared independence. \nBumin made a heqin with the Western Wei (descend from Northern Wei). Bumin then attacked the Rouran in 552, killing Yujiul\u00fc Anagui. Bumin then conquered Otuken. \nHe declared himself Illig Khagan and started the Turkic Khaganate. He died soon Bumin but his son Issik Qaghan succeeded him. Issik continued attacking the Rouran but died a year later in 553. His brother Muqan Qaghan finished the job and annihilated the Rouran in 555."}

The horse may have came from the steppe, around Kazakhstan. With the horses the steppe was a highway that moved people from China to Europe. For this reason it became important for the Silk Road.\nThe steppe has been ruled by many empires.

It will serve extra traffic along the north-south corridor that is currently being served by the Central Expressway (CTE). It was announced on 30 January 2008. It was announced during a major review of Singapore's transport network by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). The expressway would cost about S$7\u20138 billion when to build. It is planned to be finished being built in 2026. It will connect the East Coast Parkway (ECP) with the northern parts of Singapore.\nThe NSC will have 16 entrances and 17 exits to connect towns along the north-south corridor. They are Woodlands, Sembawang, Yishun, Ang Mo Kio, Bishan and Toa Payoh. It will connect them with the city centre. The NSC will also connect with already-built expressways, like the Seletar Expressway (SLE), Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) and East Coast Parkway (ECP).\nAccording to the Land Transport Authority, the bus lanes along the NSC will reduce bus travelling times from Woodlands, Sembawang, Yishun and Ang Mo Kio to the city by up to 30 minutes. It is done through morning and evening peak express bus services. It can speed up bus routes between towns along the NSC faster by allowing buses to use the ramps and bus lanes in it. A cycling path along the entire length of the highway will link up Park Connector Networks and cycling path networks within HDB towns along the entire road to the city centre.\nAt first, it was supposed to be built by 2023. Because of construction delays, it now can only be built by 2026.\nHistory.\nOn 19 January 2011, the government allowed the expressway to be built. It was to be built between the roads Admiralty Road West and Toa Payoh Rise. On 15 November 2011, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) revealed the whole route of the North-South Corridor. \nIt was first planned to be an expressway for vehicles to be built by 2020. However, the corridor will now be built as Singapore's first \"integrated transport corridor\". It will have bus routes and cycling path along the entire expressway. Its construction was supposed to start in 2017, and it was supposed to be finally built by 2023. However, the first contract was only given in November 2017, with construction work starting in early 2018. \nNow, it is planned to be finished by 2026.\nRoute.\nThe NSC will stat at Admiralty Road West in the North of Singapore. It would go south and pass by Woodlands and Sembawang. It would have a junction with the Seletar Expressway. It would then go through Toa Payoh. It would run parallel with the Central Expressway, and then join the East Coast Parkway in the city.\nThe LTA tried to use as much state land as possible. This makes sure that as few private properties are take as possible. Even though the expressway is underground in its Southern part, some land had to be taken. This is because there are MRT tunnels blocking its way. The Rochor Centre had to be demolished because of this. Some underpasses at Novena Square had to be demolished. The Ellison Building may also have to be demolished."}

Completed in 2006, it is named after its developers, the Beetham Organisation, and was designed by SimpsonHaugh and Partners. The development occupies a sliver of land at the top of Deansgate, hence its elongated plan, and was proposed in July 2003, with construction starting a year later.\nAt a height of , it is the tallest externally complete building in Manchester and tallest outside London in the United Kingdom. It was described by the \"Financial Times\" as \"the UK's first proper skyscraper outside London\". From 2006 to 2018, the skyscraper was the tallest building in Manchester and outside London in the United Kingdom. In November 2018 it was surpassed by the newly topped out South Tower at Deansgate Square; which is tall.\nAs a result of the elongated floor plan, the structure is one of the thinnest skyscrapers in the world with a height to width ratio of 10:1 on the east west fa\u00e7ade, but is noticeably wider on the north south fa\u00e7ade. A four-metre cantilever marks the transition between hotel and residential use on the north fa\u00e7ade, and a blade structure on the south side of the building acts as a fa\u00e7ade overrun accentuating its slim form and doubles as a lightning rod. The skyscraper is visible from ten English counties on a clear day.\nFloors 1 to 22 are occupied by the 279-bedroom four-star Hilton Manchester Deansgate Hotel. The 23rd floor has a four-metre cantilevered overhang with two glass windows in its floor, overlooking the ground from the skybar, Cloud 23, the only such bar in Manchester. The floor has a bar and lounge operated by Hilton. Floors 25 to 47 are occupied by residential apartments.\nThe top floor penthouse offers views of Greater Manchester, the Cheshire Plain, the Pennines and Snowdonia. The tower is known for emitting a loud unintentional hum or howl in windy weather, believed to emanate from the glass 'blade' atop the building. The hum has been recorded as a B below middle C and can be heard over large parts of the local area.\nArchitectural response to the skyscraper is polarised and interpretations vary. Some questioned its dominant appearance over the city \u2013 particularly over listed buildings with one author going as far to say the skyscraper instantly \"torpedoed\" any possibility of Manchester becoming a UNESCO World Heritage City \u2013 a status Manchester was previously on the United Kingdom shortlist for due its industrial past.\nOthers feel its dramatic appearance and peculiarity is reflective of Manchester, and that the Beetham Tower symbolises Manchester's reinvention as a post-industrial city - particularly since the bombing of 1996. Nevertheless, it has received praise and was awarded the best tall building in the world in 2007 by the Council for Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat."}

Created in February 1859, the railroad reached the Kansas-Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo, Colorado, in 1876. To create a demand for its services, the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farm land. Despite the name, its main railroad never served Santa Fe, New Mexico. This was because the terrain was too rough. A branch line from Lamy reached Santa Fe instead.\nThe railroad officially ended on December 31, 1996, when it merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway.\nThe Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway (AT&amp;SF) was created on February 11, 1859, to join Atchison and Topeka, Kansas, with Santa Fe, New Mexico. In its early years, the railroad helped people settle in Kansas. A lot of its revenue came from wheat grown there and from cattle driven north from Texas to Wichita and Dodge City by September 1872.\nAT&amp;SF reached Albuquerque in 1880. Santa Fe (the original goal of the railroad) was on a short branch from Lamy, New Mexico.\nBurlington Northern merger.\nOn September 22, 1995, AT&amp;SF merged with Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway (BNSF). The two lines kept separate operations until December 31, 1996 when it officially became BNSF."}

Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (after whom the instrument was then named), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching. It should also carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band. Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or \"buzz\" into a large cupped mouthpiece. Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player. Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres. Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like fiberglass; today both types are in wide use."}

On 13 May 1783, the first eleven ships of the Imperial Russian Navy reached the Sevastopol Bay.\nIn the Crimean War (1853\u20131856), all large ships were sunk on purpose in the entrance to the bay.

He spent most of his career as a backup to quarterback Donovan McNabb and as the place-kick holder for David Akers. His action as a starter was limited to five games in the 1998 season and one game in the 2002 season, in which McNabb was out with a broken ankle. Detmer played well in that game, going 18 of 26 for 227\u00a0yards and three total touchdowns (two passing and one rushing). He dislocated his elbow in the fourth quarter of that game and was replaced by third-string quarterback A. J. Feeley. Detmer healed enough to play in the final games of 2002, but head coach Andy Reid decided to stay with Feeley, who was having success. He also saw sporadic playing time in the 2004 and 2005 seasons.\nPrior to the 2006 season, Detmer was released after the Eagles brought back A. J.

It is faster than Andante, but slower than Presto. Sometimes, the term is translated: Composers such as Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel used the word \"vite\", Gustav Mahler wrote Rasch, and Benjamin Britten wrote \"Quickly\". Most people say that piece that is played allegro should generally be played at speeds of between 120 and 168 beats per minute. \nSometimes Allegro is used in the title of musical pieces, for example the Allegro barbaro by Bela Bartok."}

{"id": "706758", "revid": "551548", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=706758", "title": "Intermediate cartridge", "text": "An intermediate cartridge is a bullet used for assault rifles and some light machine guns. They are not as large as full-sized rifle bullets, and they do not have as much stopping power, penetration power, or effective range. However, more of them can be carried because they are smaller. They still have more stopping power, penetration power, and effective range than most pistol bullets. They are still powerful enough to shoot through most bullet-proof vests and they can kill a fully grown person if aimed well enough. Intermediate cartridges include the Russian 7.62 x 39mm, the 7.62mm NATO, and the German 7.92 Kurz. They are made to be just good enough for most firefights, so they are used for many short- and medium-range guns.\nThe idea for an intermediate cartridge came with the German military making the StG-44. During World War II, the German miltary learned that most firefights happened in fewer than 300 meters. The bolt-action rifles used by most German soldiers were not good enough for short-range because they were too slow to fire, the bullets used for them were too heavy, and the guns kicked back too hard, causing soldiers to lose their accuracy when shooting quickly. Submachine guns were not good enough for medium range because they were less accurate and powerful at longer ranges. At medium-range, German soldiers needed a different kind of gun altogether. They needed a gun that could shoot accurately up to 300 meters, powerful enough to kill a person at that range, and could carry a bullet small enough that soldiers could carry a lot of them. The gun they made to meet these needs was called the StG-44. Rifles that fired these kinds of bullets are called assault rifles, and the StG-44 was the first of these.\nThe StG-44 fired the 7.92 x 33mm Kurz bullet. The bullet was the same size as the 7.92 x 57mm Mauser, but the case was about half the size. It was not as powerful or accurate at long range, but it was smaller and had less kickback. This made it great at medium ranges. It was used by German soldierd late in the war, mostly on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately for the Germans, the StG-44 was used too late in the war to help them win.\nWhen Soviet soldiers found StG-44's, they too got the idea to make rifles that fired intermediate cartridges. They made the 7.62 x 39mm based the larger 7.62 x 54mmR. Guns the Soviets made that fired the 7.62 x 39mm include the AK-47, the SKS, and the RPK.\nDuring the early part of the Vietnam War, American soldiers though that the 7.62mm NATO bullets were too heavy to carry. To fix this problem, gun designers made a completely new bullet, the 5.56mm NATO. It was a very small bullet, but it had a very high effective range because it had a very high muzzle velocity. This is called a Small Caliber High Velocity (SCHV) bullet. It was not as powerful as the 7.62mm NATO, but the designers believed that wounding soldiers rather than killing them would be more effective. This was because fellow soldiers would have to risk their lives to rescue wounded soldiers. Nonetheless, a well-aimed shot can still kill a person easily. Also, soldiers could carry twice as many 5.56mm NATO bullets. Most medium-range NATO guns today fire the 5.56mm NATO, including the M16, the M4, the SAW M249, the FAMAS, the Steyr AUG, and the G36.\nThe Soviet Union saw the effectiveness of the 5.56mm NATO, so they hired Mikhail Kalshnikov, the creator of the AK-47, to make a SCHV assault rifle for the Soviets. He made the AK-74, which was based of the AK-47, but it fired a smaller bullet, the 5.45 x 39mm bullet."}

It is a Small Caliber High Velocity (SCHV) bullet, which means it is very small, but it has a high muzzle velocity and effective range.\nAfter hearing about the success of NATO's new SCHV bullet, the 5.56mm NATO, in the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union believed they needed to make their own to be able to fight off NATO. They hired Mikhail Kalashnikov, the creator of the AK-47, to make an SCHV assault rifle. Kalashnikov disliked the idea because he felt the Soviet Union needed to outdo NATO weapons, not copy their ideas. Nonetheless, he made the AK-74, the first gun to fire the 5.45 x 39mm."}

Riveting was a main method of building metal ships, bridges and many other complex metal objects. It was developed in the early industrial revolution from earlier ideas. It is no longer the main method of metal fastening, but examples can be seen all over the world.\nThe key idea is that the slug of metal is red-hot when hammered into place. This results in the slug of metal having a dumbell shape which holds the two metal sheets together. An automatic jackhammer is used to force the metal into position, so giving a bulb on the inside face away from the pounding. The process (for example, of ship building) was very noisy. As the metal cooled, the two end of the rivet were pulled together, making a tight joint.\nTo be a riveter was skilled work. The men worked in teams of four: two to heat the rivet and pass it to the two fasteners. It was therefore an expensive process even when it was shortened by mechanising the heating process as in the example shown. \nRivets could be tested simply by tapping. A rivet tightly set in its hole gives a clear ring, while a loose rivet produces a different sound.\nRiveting developed in many ways, and there are many different kinds of rivets. Today riveting has been largely replaced by welding, or by high-strength bolts. However, riveting is still used where light weight and high strength are critical, such as in aircraft. "}

The entire river is in the U.S. state of Kansas in the northwest part of the state. The river got its name from the French translation of its Native name Ne Miskua. It refers to how salty the river is.\nGeography.\nThe Saline River starts in the High Plains of northwestern Kansas. The south tributary of the river rises near the Sherman County-Thomas County line. The north tributary rises in central Thomas County. The confluence of the two rivers are in Sheridan County roughly northwest of Grinnell, Kansas. From this confluence, the Saline River goes east for through the Smoky Hills region of north-central Kansas. It joins the Smoky Hill River about 1 mile south of New Cambria, Kansas in Saline County. The Saline is slow and can't be used for transportation. It has no major tributaries. It has a riverbed of sand and mud.\nThe Saline River goes through these counties:\nHistory.\nThe first recorded reference to the Saline River was on October 18, 1724, by French explorer Etienne Venyard de Bourgmont. He wrote that he found a \"small river where the water was briny.\" Bourgmont was on his way to discuss a peace treaty with the Padouca. Their \"Grand Village\" was on the Saline River's banks. In 1806, an American journey led by Zebulon Pike crossed the river on its way to visit the Pawnee. By 1817, the river was called the \"Grand Saline.\"\nThe Pawnee and the Kansa, who used the area for hunting, had land along the Saline River. This was until the 1850s when American settlers started coming. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854 created the Kansas Territory, which included all of the Saline River. By 1873, the U.S. government had removed the Kansa to a reservation in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).\nIn August 1867, Cheyenne warriors killed a group of railroad workers in Ellis County. This led to a battle between the Cheyenne and Buffalo Soldiers from Fort Hays. It became known as \"The Battle of the Saline River.\"\nThe Saline River flooded sometimes during the late 19th century. Particularly bad floods happening in 1858, 1867, and 1903. In 1964, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dammed the river in eastern Russell County for flood control, creating Wilson Lake."}

This include the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804\u20131806) and the Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition up the Red River (1806).\nPike's second journey crossed the Rocky Mountains into what is now southern Colorado. He was captured by the Spanish colonial authorities near Santa Fe. They sent Pike and his men to Chihuahua (present-day Mexico), to be questioned. Later in 1807, Pike and some of his men were led by the Spanish through Texas, and they were released near American territory in Louisiana.\nIn 1810, Pike wrote a book about his journeys. The book was so popular that it was translated into Dutch, French, and German languages, for publication in Europe. He later became a brigadier general in the American Army. He served during the War of 1812, until he was killed during the Battle of York, in April 1813.\nEarly and family life.\nEarly life and education.\nPike was born during the Revolutionary War, on January 5, 1779, near Lamberton, now called Lamington in Bedminster, New Jersey, in Somerset County, New Jersey. His mother was Isabella (Brown), and his father was Zebulon Pike. He would become similar to his father, who had started his own career in the military service of the United States in 1775, at the outset of the American Revolutionary War.\nMarriage and family.\nZebulon Pike, Jr. married Clarissa Harlow Brown in 1801. They had one child who lived to become an adult, Clarissa Brown Pike. She later married President William Henry Harrison's son, John Cleves Symmes Harrison. They had four other children who died before becoming adults.\nMilitary career.\nWar of 1812.\nPike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813. Along with General Jacob Brown, Pike left Sackets Harbor, on the New York shore of Lake Ontario. This would be his last military campaign. On this campaign, Pike led soldiers in the successful attack on York (now Toronto), on April 27, 1813. Pike was killed, along with other American soldiers, by flying rocks and other debris. This was when the withdrawing British blew up its ammunition supply as Pike's troops got close to Fort York. His body was brought by ship back to Sackets Harbor. His body were buried at the military cemetery.\nLegacy.\nPike's 20th century reputation focused on his exploration. His name appeared often on natural features, such as dams, islands, lakes, and parks.\nIn 1901, General William Jackson Palmer built a marble statue of Zebulon Pike. It was placed near the main entrance of the Antlers Hotel.\u00a0 Pike was later honored in 1926 with a bronze medallion portrait placed in the pavilion at Tahama Spring in Monument Valley Park, Colorado Springs.\nMilitary.\nA building at Fort Knox is named in his honor."}

This was when Topeka, Kansas was hit by an F5 rated tornado. It started in the southwest Topeka, and it moved northeast. It went through several neighborhoods and over a local landmark named Burnett's Mound. 57 tornadoes were confirmed during the 11-day span, which left 18 people dead and 543 injured.\nTopeka, Kansas tornado.\nA local Native American legend said that Burnet's Mound (a local landmark that was named after Potawatomi Indian chief Abram Burnett) was thought to protect the city from tornadoes. It was thought that the hill would cause a tornado that was going to Topeka to die. A few years earlier, a water tower had been built on the mound. This caused controversy among many Topeka residents. They thought it would make the mound less able to protect Topeka fro from tornades. However, ten other tornadoes had hit the city since Kansas state tornado records were first kept in 1889. The 1966 tornado was much stronger than the other ten tornadoes that hit Topeka before June 8.\nThe Topeka tornado started developing at 6:55\u00a0p.m. Central Time on June 8, touching down west of the city. The National Weather Service could not find the developing tornado on radar. This is because the Topeka forecast office used a modified military radar that was given by the U.S. government after World War II. While it was considered very good for its time, it was not good at finding tornadoes activity, compared to the Doppler weather radar of the present day. Around 7:30\u00a0p.m., a 1/4 to 1/2-mile (400\u2013800 m) wide tornado went to the southwest side Topeka, moving northeast, and passed over Burnett's Mound. Bill Kurtis, then a reporter for WIBW-TV (channel 13; then a hybrid CBS/ABC/NBC affiliate, now only affiliated with CBS) wanted to tell people to take shelter from the devastating storm. He told viewers to get to safety by urging in a calm but stern manner, \"for God's sake, take cover!\"\nThe total damage estimate was put at $104 million (US$ million in ). This makes it one of the costliest tornadoes in U.S. history. 16 people were killed, and many others were injured. However, it is believed that if the had tornado hit during school and work hours or during the night, that as many as 5,000 people would have been killed. Bill Kurtis was credited for saving many lives with his urgent message to take cover."}

He previously served as leader of the People's United Party (PUP) and as Leader of the Opposition of Belize from 2011 to 2016. First elected to the Belize House of Representatives in 2003, Fonseca served as Attorney General and Minister of Education, Culture and Labour in Prime Minister Said Musa's cabinet from 6 March 2003 until 9 February 2008, when the PUP lost the general election to the opposition United Democratic Party (UDP). Fonseca also served as the Chairman of the People's United Party (PUP) from 6 March 2003 to 22 February 2008. Fonseca was one of only six PUP area representatives nationwide to retain his seat in the National Assembly in the 2008 election.\nFollowing the election defeat and subsequent resignation of Musa as prime minister and PUP leader on 30 March 2008, the party held a 2008 People's United Party (Belize) leadership election and convention to select its new leader. The party held it's nomination day on 21 February 2008 and the actual day for it's leadership election and convention on 30 March 2008. Fonseca along with second deputy leader of the PUP, Johnny Brice\u00f1o stood as candidates for the party leadership at the convention, Fonseca was nominated by the United Woman's Group and several other constituency committees including Cayo West, Cayo North, Cayo South, Pickstock, Dangriga, Stann Creek West, Toledo East and Toledo West. Fonseca was thought to be the candidate preferred by the party establishment. He had the endorsements of former Prime minister, Said Musa and George Cadle Price. Fonseca also had the support of First Deputy Leader, Juan Vildo Marin and former Tourism minister, Godfrey Smith as well as from Secretary General, Henry Usher and Communication Director, Yasser Musa. Fonseca's campaigned for Leadership of the party has, to say the least, taken a life of its own.

In Brice\u00f1o acceptance speech after getting the results, Brice\u00f1o acknowledged Fonseca and said \u201cTo Francis my brother, my friend, my college I offer my thanks for being a worthy opponent and a true and honourable man\u201d. Following the resignation of Brice\u00f1o as PUP leader on 7 October 2011, another 2011 People's United Party leadership election and convention was called. The party held it's nominations on 9 October 2011 and this time, both Fonseca and Albert Area Representative, Mark Espat submitted their nominations and ultimately stood as candidates for the party's leadership. However, this time the game was different. Fonseca campaigned well and sighted insecurity in the PUP that he will address if elected leader. After results were announced on 2 November 2011, it was made clear that Fonseca had emerged victorious over Espat. After he got into the leadership realms, Fonseca focused on delivering his promise and preparing the PUP for the 2012 general election. During the 2012 election campaign, he supported on further oil exploration and pledged a moratorium over continued exploration."}

{"id": "707795", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=707795", "title": "Barraba, New South Wales", "text": "Barraba is a village in New South Wales, Australia. This village is in the New England region and it is in the local government area of Tamworth Regional Council. This village is also in the Bundarra-Barraba Important Bird Area. This area is for the conservation of an endangered bird, the Regent Honeyeater (\"Anthochaera phrygia\").\nBarraba is 477 kilometres (296 miles) north-west from Sydney and 548 kilometres (341 miles) south-west from Brisbane. Barraba is 90 kilometres (56 miles) north from Tamworth, which is the nearest city. The Manilla River flows next to Barraba. This village is on a road called \"Fossickers Way\" and it is in a mountain range called the Nandewar Range at an altitude of 500 metres (1,640 feet) above sea level.\nHistory.\nIndigenous Australians called the Kamilaroi lived in the district before the European people arrived. The first European in the district was an explorer and botanist named Allan Cunningham, who came there in 1827. The first farm in the district, \"Barraba Station\", began in 1837 or 1838. The site of the village was surveyed in 1852.\nThe discovery of gold helped the village to grow bigger. The first post office was opened in 1856 and the first school was opened in 1861. The first Anglican church was built in 1876 and the first bank was also opened in 1876. The first hotel, \"The Commerical Hotel\", was built in 1878 and the first court house was built in 1881. Barraba was officially called a village in 1885. The hospital was built in 1891 and the Methodist church was built in 1898.\nBarraba's newspaper, \"The Barraba Gazette\", began publishing in 1900, but the newspaper closed in 2020. The Catholic church was built in 1906. The railway came to Barraba in 1908, however the last train went to Barraba in 1983 and the line closed in 1987. The Connors Creek Dam was built in 1933. This dam improved the water supply of the village.\nMining.\nCopper.\nCopper was discovered at Gulf Creek in 1889 and the first mine was started in 1892. Gulf Creek is 22 kilometres (14 miles) north-east from Barraba. A small village began to grow, which had a hotel, a school, and a post office. This copper mine was the biggest copper mine in New South Wales in 1903 and the little village had 300 people living there. The mine was closed in the 1930s, and the post office was closed in 1966. The little village was abandoned.\nAsbestos.\nAsbestos was mined from 1919 until 1983 at Woodsreef, which was a little village 15 kilometres (10 miles) east from Barraba. The mine was made bigger in 1974. This mine produced 5,000,000 metric tonnes of white asbestos.\nThe abandoned mine left behind 75,000,000 metric tonnes of waste rocks and 25,000,000 metric tonnes of asbestos. The asbestos heap covers 43 hectares (107 acres) and is up to 70 metres (230 feet) high.\nA television report in 2008 described the growing worry that the remaining asbestos could harm the health for the people who live in Barraba and for the people who visit the village. A foundation, \"The Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia\", demanded that the mine should be cleaned up. This foundation also demanded that people must not be allowed to go to the mine. A public dirt road crossed the mine site but that road was closed in 2013. The little village was abandoned.\nThe government health service, \"Hunter-New England Health\", did an urgent study about the possible harm to the health of the people of Barraba, but that study has not been published.\nDiatomite.\nDiatomite, or diatomaceous earth, is a mineral made from the fossils of diatoms. This mineral is used to make explosives, filters, abrasives, insecticide, thermal materials, catalysis support, and in farming, and construction. A mine was started near Barraba in 1982.\nJewels and Fossils.\nPyrites, jasper, garnets, zeolite, and red, yellow, and brown quartz can be found around Barraba. Searching for these jewels is called fossicking. People can also find fossils around Barraba.\nFarming.\nThe farms in the district have cattle for beef, merino sheep for wool and mutton, and they can also grow wheat.\nClimate.\nThe summers in Barraba are hot and humid, and the winters here are cold and dry. The highest recorded temperature is 41.8\u00b0 Celsius (107\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and the lowest recorded temperature is -9.4\u00b0 Celsius (15\u00b0 Fahrenheit). The average yearly rainfall is 688.7 millimetres (27 inches) and the most rain that fell in one day is 194.3 millimetres (7.5 inches) which fell on February 25, 1955.\nWater.\nBefore Split Rock Dam was built, the people in Barraba got their water from the Manilla River, Barraba Creek, and Connors Creek Dam. When these sources were almost empty, the people got their water from emergency wells.\nThe Split Rock Dam was built in 1988 and a pipeline from that dam to Barraba was built in 2015."}

The video game series has five main games and one reboot game.\nFor most of the series, the player plays as Dante, a demon-hunter who is half-human and half-demon. The player earns upgrades, learns new moves, and buys items using Red Orbs, a pickup the player gets by exploring the level and killing enemies. The player gets more Red Orbs from enemies by getting a higher Combo Ranking. The player increases their Combo Ranking by killing multiple enemies quickly without getting hurt and by using many different attacks in a short amount of time.\nInterestingly enough, the first \"Devil May Cry\" game was supposed to be \"Resident Evil 4\". However, the game became so different from earlier \"Resident Evil\" games that the development team decided that the game should be a new IP instead of a Resident Evil game. The first \"Devil May Cry\" game sold well and got good reviews. Due to the game's popularity, it had several sequels and inspired other hack and slash games like \"Bayonetta.\"\nDespite the first game getting good reviews, the sequel, \"Devil May Cry 2\", got poor reviews. Nonetheless, since the second game sold well there was enough money to make ', which got many good reviews, although it got some criticisms for being such a difficult game. \"Devil May Cry 4\" also got good reviews, and the difficulty was made a little easier so that more people could enjoy it, but it was criticized for reusing levels instead of making more levels. Worried that the game series could lose its appeal to video game players if it did not change the game series much, Capcom hired a British game developer named Ninja Theory to reboot the game series with '. The game was loosely based on the story of the earlier games, but the game had a much darker tone and Dante's look and personality was changed a lot. While the game got positive reviews from professional critics, it was criticized very heavily by fans of the series, who did not like Dante's new look and personality. Due to harsh criticisms from the fans, Capcom decided to continue the original series by making \"Devil May Cry 5\"."}

This is important because Newton's First Law of Motion teaches that whenever something moves, there is a motion that goes the opposite direction that is just as strong. This is why guns have recoil. Whenever a gun shoots a bullet forward, the bullet going forward creates an equally strong movement backward. The heavier a bullet is, the more force needed to fire a bullet forward, and therefore the more force the bullet sends the gun backward. Recoilless rifles can fire very large bullets and explosives without hurting their users because they are made with a hole in the back of the gun so that the force from firing the gun goes behind the user, rather than towards the user's shoulder. People using recoilless rifles must be very careful that no one is behind them when they are shooting because the force going behind the gun, or the backblast, is powerful enough to kill a person."}

In these games, players need to pay attention to how far their enemies are, the effective range of their sniper rifles, and how hard the wind is blowing, since all of these will affect where the player's bullets will hit. Most of the levels are about the player going to the vantage point (the best place for a sniper to kill his or her target), killing or destroying his or her target, and evacuating the area.\nPlayers will need to use stealth throughout the levels, since the player can die with just a few hits. If players fire their rifles when there are loud noises in the background, the player can kill enemy soldiers without other soldiers noticing. However, the player must be careful to hide dead bodies or shoot when no one is watching, since dead bodies will alert other enemy soldiers and make them harder to hit. If the player holds his or her lungs, the in-game time will slow down and there will be a marker that shows where the bullet will hit. The games have an X-ray feature that shows where the bullets hit the enemy and how the bullets injure enemies. Points are awarded based on how far the player is, where the player hits the enemy, and whether other enemy soldiers notice the player killing them.\nAlong with a sniper rifle, the player can also carry a pistol, a submachine gun, and explosives. Some pistols have a suppressor so that the player can kill enemies without being heard, others do not, so the player must be careful when choosing his or her weapons. Submachine guns are best used in emergency close-quarters firefights, but the player must be careful not to waste ammo. Explosives can be used to lay traps for the enemy or protect the player from being flanked.\nIn some of the games, there are DLC levels where the player is sent to assassinate Adolf Hitler."}

Overtime Francisco continued intensifying while moving towards Japan. Francisco gradually strengthened over the next few days becoming a severe tropical storm with 65 mph winds and a pressure of 985. Francisco continued to move when it the Bonin Islands. The storm moved towards Japan and after 12 hours it became a typhoon. Typhoon Francisco made landfall in Japan on August 6 early in the morning. Typhoon Francisco weakened down to a tropical storm but, is said to make landfall in South Korea as well. \nPreparations and impact.\nJapan.\nIn anticipation of coastal flooding, 20,020\u00a0people were evacuated from Kokuraminami-ku and Moji-ku. Striking Kyushu as a typhoon, Francisco brought heavy rain and strong winds to much of the island. Rainfall accumulations exceeded in Nobeoka and in Saiki. A maximum wind gust of was observed at Miyazaki Airport. Two people suffered injury after being knocked over by strong winds.\nKorean Peninsula.\nHeavy rainfall will also be a concern across South Korea as Francisco tracks northward through Wednesday.\nBusan and southeast South Korea were the first to be impacted by Francisco with nearly 75 mm (3 inches) of rain falling in less than 10 hours on Tuesday.\nRainfall of 75-150 mm (3-6 inches) is expected across the eastern half of the country with 25-75 mm (1-3 inches) in west-central locations and less than 25 mm (1 inch) in western parts of the country, including Seoul.\nFrancisco will remain a tropical depression as it moves into the Sea of Japan (East Sea) late Wednesday.

The ninth named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Lekima originated from a tropical depression that formed east of the Philippines on July\u00a030. It gradually organized, became a tropical storm and was named on August 4. Lekima intensified under favourable environmental conditions and peaked as a Category 4\u2013equivalent super typhoon. However, an eyewall replacement cycle caused the typhoon to weaken before it made landfall in Zhejiang late on August 9, as a Category 2\u2013equivalent typhoon. Lekima weakened subsequently while moving across the East China, and made its second landfall in Shandong on August 11.\nLekima's precursor enhanced the southwestern monsoon in the Philippines, which brought heavy rain to the country. The rains caused three boats to sink and 31 people died in this accident. Lekima brought catastrophic damage in mainland China, with a death toll of 89 people and more than CN\u00a553.7\u00a0billion (US$7.6\u00a0billion) in damages. The system also caused minor damage in Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan.\nMeteorological history.\nOn August 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to monitor a tropical depression which developed over the Philippine Sea. The system slowly developed while moving northward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also monitored the system and gave the identifier \"10W\" early on August 4. The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned the name \"Lekima\" at 6:00\u00a0a.m. UTC that day. The JTWC followed suit later that day. Though Lekima was affected by moderate wind shear, warm waters of and good outflow channel allowed Lekima to slowly intensify, and Lekima became almost stationary due to the absence of steering current.\nOn August 6, Lekima steered by a subtropical ridge to the northeast and accelerated to the northwest, and the JMA upgraded Lekima to a severe tropical storm. Later that day, both JMA and JTWC upgraded Lekima to a typhoon, after the system developed a central dense overcast. As Lekima continued to move northwestward, the system moved into an area of low wind shear, and it started a process of rapid intensification on August 7. The eye became evident on satellite imagery. On August 8, the JTWC upgraded Lekima to a super typhoon, and stated that the system had acquired some of the annular characteristics. Later that day, the JMA stated that Lekima attained maximum sustained winds of . At the same time, Lekima passed between Miyako-jima and Tarama-jima.\nShortly thereafter, Lekima began an eyewall replacement cycle. The typhoon developed a concentric eyewall, as seen from the radar. This cycle also caused the motion of Lekima slightly veered to the north, and the JTWC downgraded Lekima back to typhoon late on August 8. Environmental conditions in East China Sea became less favourable, causing Lekima to slowly weaken while approaching East China. At 1:45\u00a0a.m. China Standard Time () August 10, Lekima made landfall in Wenling, Zhejiang with two-minute sustained winds of . Lekima quickly weakened and turned to the north, along the western side of the subtropical ridge. Lekima dropped below typhoon intensity early on August 10, and weakened further to a tropical storm later that day. Lekima emerged into the Yellow Sea early on August 11, and made second landfall in Xihai'an, Qingdao, Shandong at 8:50\u00a0p.m. CST, with two-minute sustained winds of . The JTWC issued its final warning to the system around that time. Lekima meandered over the Shandong Peninsula and Bohai Sea throughout August 12, and the JMA downgraded it to a tropical depression later that day.\nPreparations and impact.\nPhilippines.\nAs Lekima moved northwestward and approached the northern part of the Philippines, PAGASA issued PSWS#1 to Batanes and the Babuyan Islands late on August 6. These warnings were lifted after Lekima left the Philippine Area of Responsibility.\nThough Lekima, locally known as \"Hanna\", did not directly affect the Philippines, it enhanced the southwest monsoon which caused heavy rain to the nation. Three boats sank in Guimaras Strait; 31 people died and three were left missing. Heavy rains also caused flooding in Metro Manila. Classes of numerous cities were suspended on August 5. A motorboat carrying 10 passengers capsized off the coast of Mactan Island in the early morning of August 7. To the south, waves from Lekima displaced more than 1,300 people in Davao City. Agricultural damage in Central Luzon was at \u20b180.5\u00a0million (US$1.55\u00a0million).\nRyukyu Islands.\nAs Lekima approached the southwestern Ryukyu Islands, Ishigaki-jima and Miyako-jima received a storm warning. The JMA urged the residents on these islands to beware of high waves, heavy rain, and sudden gusts. Gusts in Miyako-jima reached , while gusts in Shimojishima Airport and Iriomote-jima reached and respectively. Six people were injured during the storm, and thousands of families suffered from power outages. Hundreds of flights and passenger ship trips were cancelled on August 7\u20139, mainly in Miyako-jima and Ishigaki-jima, affecting thousands of passengers. Agricultural damage across the island chain was JP\u00a5347\u00a0million (US$3.29\u00a0million).\nTaiwan.\nTaiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning on August 7. As Lekima continued to approach the island, the CWB issued a land warning to the northern part of Taiwan early on the next day, locally. The CWB lifted the land warning late on August 9, and lifted the sea warning early on the next day, after Lekima made landfall in East China. On late August 8, school and work were cancelled for the next day in eight municipalities and counties in the northern part of Taiwan and in the Matsu Islands. Hundreds of flights and ships were cancelled and delayed.\nThroughout Taiwan, Lekima killed two people and injured 15 others. More than 80,000 families suffered power outages. On August 8\u20139, Wufeng Township recorded a rainfall total of , while rainfall in Taichung amounted to . Lekima's downdraft affected Kinmen on August 9, where a farmland recorded temperature of , setting the national record for the second highest temperature. Jinfeng Township also recorded a temperature of . Institutional damage of Lekima, along with a magnitude 6.0 earthquake reached NT$5.24\u00a0million (US$167,000).\nMainland China.\nStriking East China as a super typhoon, according to China Meteorological Administration, Lekima wrought major damage across numerous provinces. In all, the typhoon killed 56 people and left 14 others missing. Damage nationwide reached CN\u00a553.72\u00a0billion (US$7.6\u00a0billion). Zhejiang was the worst hit province; 39 people died in the province, and economic loss reached CN\u00a524.22\u00a0billion (US$3.43\u00a0billion). Most of those killed died because of landslides in Yongjia County, and the landslides blocked a river. Water levels rose in ten minutes, and many residents could not evacuate in time. Wenling recorded peak wind gusts of , while daily rainfall in Beilun District amounted to .\nLekima also brought significant effects in Shandong, where 5 people were killed and the damage statewide amounted to CN\u00a51.475\u00a0billion (US$209\u00a0million). Because Lekima looped around Shandong for days, it brought heavy rainfall in the province. Daily rainfall in Linqu County reached .\nMalaysia.\nThe tail front of Lekima stretched south to Malaysia and struck the northern states of the Malay Peninsula on August 9, causing widespread damage and injuring 10 people in the states of Kedah, Penang and Perlis. The storm also caused damage to 329 schools, according to the Malaysian Ministry of Education. Wind speeds in some areas were recorded at ."}

Two rifles made during this time were the Henry and Spencer rifles. They fired much more quickly and could be loaded much faster than muzzleloading rifles. However, their use was limited because many generals felt that the ability to shoot many bullets without reloading would cause soldiers to shoot with less accuracy. However, after the Civil War, lever-action guns became much more popular. They were popular with not just soldiers, but also with hunters and even civilians. They were so popular that the most famous lever-action rifle, the Winchester Model 1873, was called \"the gun that won the West\".\nBoth the militaries of the United States and the Russian Empire used lever-action guns often until the beginning of the 20th century. Even though lever action guns can fire much faster than bolt-action rifles (lever-actions can fire 2 rounds a second in skilled hands,) the bolt-action rifle was chosen to be the main gun for most infantry. This was because bolt-action rifles could easily be fired when soldiers are lying on the ground, but lever-actions cannot do so easily.\nLever-action guns were made for many different types of bullets, both pistol and rifle bullets. Most lever-action guns are rifles, but there are also lever-action shotguns as well. The most famous of these are the Winchester Model 1887."}

He is the father of Jethalal who immigrated from ancestral village of Gada family, Bhachau, to live with the family of Jethalal in Mumbai. He is a widower and is eccentric and temperamental in nature. Despite being nearly 72 years old, he is more energetic than Jethalal. He performs Pranayam and Yoga and is an active member of Young Old Group, a small group founded by him and his friends. Champaklal loves his whole family and enjoys special bonding with his grandson Tapu. He always takes the side of Tapu and Daya whenever Jethalal scolds them. Due to his supreme decision-making authority, Jethalal is often sidelined in family matters. He loves Jethalal with his whole heart but shows it on very rare occasions. He always scolds Jethalal and angrily calls him \"babuchak\" and \u201cakkal vagar jo dhandho\u201d. He calls Jethalal as \"Jethiya\", Tapu as \"Tapuda\", and Daya as \u201cBahu\u201d.

However, Champaklal is a fatherly figure for Gokuldham residents. He is always given immense respect and is involved in the decision-making process. Everyone calls him Chachaji and whole Tapusena calls him Dadaji. Champaklal always acts as a peacemaker in issues and verbal spats. He is also very fond of Daya's cooking skills and has Mehta be his troubleshooter when Jetha is not available.\nAlthough his original character, as written in \"Duniya ne Undha Chashmah\" by Taarak Mehta, is rebellious, rustic and ever quarrelling, in the show he is loyal to Gandhian principles and abhors unethical practices such as theft, quarrels and corruption. He is strictly against alcohol and dislikes people who drink. Champaklal looks exactly like his father, the Late Jayantilal Bhimji Gada who in the show was a freedom fighter during the British rule.\nTipendra Jethalal Gada.\nThe son of Daya and Jethalal and also he is the leader of Tappu Sena. He used to be mischievous in early episodes and always causes Jethalal Problems, He is loved by his grandfather and mother but Jethalal is strict to him and shows his love to Tappu sometimes."}

Under the ground in the Amazon area is a huge slowly moving waterway. This slowly flowing aquifer in Brazil is about long. It is nearly below ground level. Its discovery was announced in 2011.&lt;ref name=\"Hamza Google/AFP\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamza \"river\" and the Amazon River are a twin-river system flowing at different levels of the Earth's crust.\nDescription.\nThe Hamza and the Amazon are the two main drainage systems for the Amazon Basin. The reported flow rate of the Hamza, at about per second, is 3% of the Amazon's. It runs west to east, some below the Earth's surface, and follows roughly the path of the Amazon River. The Hamza empties in the Atlantic Ocean, deep under the surface. Its own water has a high salt content.\nIt flows from the Andean foothills to the Atlantic coast in a nearly west-to-east direction like the Amazon River. Seismic data and temperature variation with depth measured in 241 inactive oil wells helped find the aquifer.\nExcept for the flow direction, the Amazon and the Hamza have very different characteristics. The most obvious ones are their width and flow speed. While the Amazon is to wide, the Hamza is to in width. But the flow speed is in the Amazon and less than speed in the Hamza.\nGeology.\nSeveral geological factors have played a vital role in the formation and existence of these subterranean water bodies. Water has worn away calcium carbonate rocks far under the ground. Water drops to great depths. East-west trending faults and the karst topography may have some role in supplying water to the \"river\".\nThe 153\u00a0km-long underground river in Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and the 8.2\u00a0km-long Cabayugan River in the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in the Philippines have come into being thanks to the karst topography. Water in these places has dissolved the carbonate rock to form extensive underground river systems."}

Most are either single- or double-barrel. Triple- and quadruple-barrel (four barrel) shotguns also exist, but single- and double-barrel shotguns are easier to make and less likely to jam. \nMost double-barrel shotguns are made with their barrels touching side-by-side. However, there are also shotguns where one barrel is on top of the other. Over-and-under shotguns are easier to aim than side-by-side shotguns because you do not need to aim a little to the left or right.\nSince the metal cartridge was invented in 1845, most shotguns were break-open shotguns until the repeating shotgun was invented. However, break-open shotguns are still popular with civilians because they are easier to use and less likely to jam than repeating shotguns. Nonetheless, they hold fewer shells than repeating shotguns."}

He was convicted in June 1993 and release from prison in February 2000.\nConviction and backlash.\nIn June 1993, Ellis was found guilty in the High Court on 16 counts of sexual offences involving children in his care at the Christchurch Civic Creche and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. His conviction has been criticized, with concerns centering on how the children's testimony was obtained and presented to the jury. \nMany people believe in Ellis' innocence and many New Zealanders have supported his calls to overturn the conviction.\nIn 1994, the Court of Appeal removed convictions on three of the charges, but kept the sentence. His conviction and sentence were removed for a second time in the Court of Appeal in October 1999. Ellis refused to attend parole board hearings while in prison because he would have to confess to the crimes in order to argue for early release. He was released in February 2000 after serving seven years in prison.\nEllis has continued to campaign to clear his name. In 2019, he appealed to the Supreme Court to have his conviction removed from his background.\nThe Ellis case was one of many high profile child abuse cases around the world in the 1980s and early 1990s. It has been mentioned as a reason for the decrease in the number of male teachers in New Zealand schools.\nPersonal life.\nEllis was born in Christchurch. He was openly bisexual. \nOn 26 July 2019, Ellis announced that he was diagnosed with terminal bladder cancer. He died on 4 September 2019 while appealing his conviction in Christchurch from the disease, aged 61."}

When someone wants to change rainforest land into a farm or other thing, first they cut down the trees and leave them there. Then they allow the land to dry. Then they set it on fire. So many of the trees were still killed because people could cut them down and wait to burn them until later.\nWildfires were also a problem on the Cerrado grassland, a place with many rare plants and animals. 40% of its animals do not live in any other place on Earth."}

The name \"Yap\" in recent years has come to also refer to the state within the Federated States of Micronesia, inclusive of the Yap Main Islands and its various outer islands.\nGeography.\nThe Yap Main Islands are considered to be made up of four separate islands: Yap Island proper (\"Marbaq\"), Gagil-Tamil, Maap, and Rumung. The four are contiguous, though separated by water, and are surrounded by a common coral reef. They are formed from an uplift of the Philippine Sea Plate, and are referred to as \"high\" islands as opposed to atolls. The land is mostly rolling hills, densely vegetated. Mangrove swamps line much of the shore, although there are beaches on the northern sides of the islands. Excluding the reef area, Yap is approximately 24\u00a0km long, 5\u201310\u00a0km wide, and 98\u00a0km. The highest elevation is at Mount Taabiywol in Fanif municipality on Yap island proper.

Hardcore Macintosh fans could therefore get a taste of the upcoming operating system before its final release. It was named Kodiak internally by Apple. The name was not publicly used.\nThe Public Beta was the first time people could use the Aqua interface. Virtually everything was new in the operating system: fonts, the Dock, even the menu bar (with an Apple logo at the centre, which was later repositioned). The icons exploded in size, and new OS eye candy was all the rage.\nAs it was a public beta, this version was not without its bugs and inconveniences. Apple used user feedback to improve upon the OS, so that a vastly improved Golden Master version of Mac OS X was ready for release by March 2001.\nThe Public Beta version came with a price tag, and a time limit (set for May 15, 2001). In spite of all these shortcomings, it was still welcomed by the Mac community, with people eager to test drive the new OS.\nThe Public Beta was superseded by Mac OS X 10.0.0, the first final release of Mac OS X."}

{"id": "709995", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=709995", "title": "Foot odor", "text": "Foot odor (or foot odour) is a type of body odor that affects the feet of humans. Some people think it is an unpleasant smell. Others may enjoy it when they have a foot fetish or olfactophilia (being attracted to certain smells). A 1994 study found that 45% of people with a foot fetish were also aroused by smelly socks and/or feet.\nCauses.\nThe main cause of foot odor is foot sweat. Sweat itself does not smell a lot, but some bacteria can grow better in a sweaty environment, which then cause the odor. These bacteria are normally on our skin and are not harmful. \nThe front part of the foot produces the most sweat. \nSweating on the feet can be increased by wearing closed shoes or boots. Especially thick materials such as leather or rubber will hold the sweat in them and can increase the odor intensity. Certain types of socks can also make the smell stronger.\nOdor qualities.\nThe quality (aroma) of foot odor is often described as thick and smelling like cheese. This is because some of the bacteria that create foot odor (like \"Brevibacteria\") are also used in the production of cheese. They produce the chemical \"3-Methylbutanoic acid,\" which is a main part that is responsible for the odor. This chemical is also often used to make perfumes.\nBecause of acids in the foot sweat, the odor may also be sour, similar to that of vinegar.\nOther things that can influence foot smell are the type of socks and shoes a person wears, how long they are worn at a time, and many individual factors, for example if the person does a lot of sports or other physical activities. Because men sweat more than women, they generally have smellier feet.\nPrevention.\nThe best method for preventing food odor is to maintain a good foot hygiene. Regular cleaning of the feet removes dead skin cells from the feet, along with sebum (a type of body oil). This reduces the opportunities for bacteria to cause smelly feet. By regularly cleaning feet properly, feet will not have a strong foot odor. A foot file or pumice stone can be used to remove dead skin cells."}

He was born in a familiar core of sailor tradition. Since he was little showed a lot of interest by the drawing and the painting. When he had only 8 years old, his teacher spoke with his mother and aimed him to extracurricular classes of painting. Because of this passion by the art , I\u00f1igo starts his studies of painting in the Faculty of Fine arts in Bilbao between 1993 and 1998, licensing in the speciality of painting.\nAfter finishing his studies, I\u00f1igo made diverse workshops between which stand out, on the one hand the workshop of MASTER painting OF THE FIGURACI\u00d3N, together with Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda and Juan Jos\u00e9 Aquerreta , in the School of Architecture of Pamplona in 2006. On the other hand, the workshop TEXTURES, given by the Australian artist David Kelly with reason o the exhibition AUSTRALIS in the room Kubokutxa of Donostia- San Sebasti\u00e1n in 2010.\nBesides, we can stand out a lot of projects during his artistic path, as well as \"Way between two waters\", of the figuraci\u00f3n to the abstraction ,in 2005, multidisciplinary exhibition that presented to the Gallery ISPILU of Zarautz as in Madrid in the gallery JOVENART. In 2007 Animated Paintings, a seasickness in the Bay of Biscay, in the gallery 3And of Bilbao. In the year 2011 made a project beside the artist Gorka Larra\u00f1aga, Txantxareatzen \u00a0that consisted in making a plastic exercise between both with his back exhibition in the gallery THE HOUSE in Mexico D.F. In the year 2016, made RTRAZO, X-ray of a gesture agonizante, in the room POLVOR\u00cdN of the Citadel of Pamplona, that later travelled to the gallery ENELESTUDIO of San Sebasti\u00e1n.\nPath.\nIf there is something that stand out in the path of I\u00f1igo is his constant and vital evolution. The need to go burning stages and to present new proposals is tangible. After devoting him 15 years exclusively to the painting, began to incorporate in his projects another type of disciplines like the sculpture, the photography and the installation, with spirit to go growing in his work.\nI\u00f1igo has been able to expose more than 50 individual exhibitions and 20 collective ,in cities like San Sebasti\u00e1n , Vitoria, Pamplona, Bilbao, Valencia, Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, Biarritz, Mexico D.F , Port wine, Abu Dabi etc., in all has been able to see his evolution. Recently, I\u00f1igo has incorporated the resin to make his pieces and also the dibond like support in his paintings, specifically in the series Rtrazo.\nBesides, on 21 June of the 2019, I\u00f1igo inaugurated his new study in Zarautz.\nWay of work.\nAs I\u00f1igo was born in a family of sailor tradition, his thematic shows prompt to the balcony of the pesqueros of bajura, the arrantzales and the bustle of the port. And it has not changed until today, I save in his exercises, that submerge it by a time in the language no figurativo. Also Manterola has worked the sculpture, converting each piece in an only piece using different materials so much the iron , steel cut ,copper , iron galvanised , nylon, stainless steel, resin or iron painted.\nAnother of the appearances to stand out of Manterola is that it believes in the synergies and in the collaborations with other artists and disciplines. It says that it exists a mutual enrichment in all maridaje. Proof of this are the exercises with artists like Gorka Larra\u00f1aga and Samuel Dougados, the project \"UNYON\" beside Ivory Jewellers and, more recently, the collaboration with the chef French , that has 3 stars Michelin, for the one who has designed the servilleteros of his restaurant of Paris and where in each table luce one of his sculptures.

The rejection of the Lecompton Constitution, and the admission of Kansas to the Union as a free state, showed the unusual and fraudulent voting practices. These practices had been used in earlier efforts by bushwhackers and border ruffians to create a state constitution in Kansas that allowed slavery.\nThe Topeka Constitution was written before the Lecompton Constitution. The Leavenworth and Wyandotte Constitutions were written after the Lecompton Constitution. The Wyandotte Consitution became the Kansas state constitution. The document was written in response to the anti-slavery 1855 Topeka Constitution. That constitution was written by James H. Lane and other free-state people. The territorial legislature was filled mostly with slave owners. They met at the chosen capital of Lecompton in September 1857. They met there to write a document that would compete against the other constitutions. Most actual settlers were anti-slavery. They [boycott]ed the vote. Territorial governor of Kansas, Robert J. Walker, was very pro-slavery. However, he was against the obvious unfairness of the Constitution. He quit being governor so he did not have to enforce it.\nPresident James Buchanan was very pro-slavery, so he supported the Lecompton Constitution when it was sent to Congress.

There are three main forms:\nA female naga is called a \"nagi\" or \"nagini\". A \"nagaraja\" is a king of the nagas. They are common in Indian mythology and play an important role in many religious traditions.\nMeaning.\n\"Naga\" (\u0928\u093e\u0917; n\u0101ga) is a Sanskrit word that means \"cobra.\" The word is sometimes also used to refer to any kind of snake.\nHinduism.\nNagas are very common in Hindu mythology and art. They are described as a proud and powerful race of semi-divine beings that can take on many forms. They live in an enchanted underworld filled with jewels, gold and other treasures. This world is called \u201cNaga-loka\u201d or \u201cPatala-loka\u201d. The nagas are guardians of treasure and keepers of magic. They are often seen in bodies of water such as lakes and oceans. \nTheir power and venom is potentially dangerous to humans. However, many nagas are benevolent, such as in the story called Samudra manthan, where the Nagaraja Vasuki who lays on Shiva's neck becomes a rope used by the gods and asuras for churning the Ocean of Milk. \nThe nagas\u2019 eternal enemies are the garudas, a bird-like deity.\nVishnu is often portrayed resting under Shesha\u2019s hood or laying on Shesha, but this symbolism can be found among other deities too. The serpent is commonly seen in art featuring Ganesha. \nBuddhism.\nNagas are a common deity in Buddhism. They usually appear in the form of a giant cobra, with one head or many heads. Sometimes nagas will use their magic powers to transform into human form. They are often called \"dragons\" in English and are understood across Asia as being the same as dragons. It is believed that nagas live both underground in their own world and in the world of humans. Some live in the earth in places like caves and caverns while others live in water such as oceans and lakes.\nThe nagas are the followers of Virupaksha one of the Four Heavenly Kings. They are also guardians on Mount Sumeru and protect the devas of Trayastrimsha heaven from the asuras.\nThere is a story of a naga who appeared in human form so that he could become a Buddhist monk. The Buddha told him that only humans were allowed to become monks. The naga took the five precepts so that he could be reborn as a human in a future life.\nThere is also an episode in the \"Lotus Sutra\" where the eight year old daughter of the dragon king transforms into a male bodhisattva and then becomes enlightened. This story may be a reference to the idea that a person must have a male body in order to become a Buddha.\nOne popular naga in Buddhism is Mucalinda, who is a Naga King and protector of the Buddha. In the Vinaya Sutra, King Mucalinda uses his hood and seven heads to shelter the Buddha from a storm. Then the king takes the form of a young Brahmin and worships the Buddha.\nAccording to tradition, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was given the Praj\u00f1ap\u0101ramita sutras by nagas who were guarding them after the Buddha left the world."}
